2163755,5,B00063MAXQ,"""Ladder 49"" is superb! This is the best movie about firefighters since ""Backdraft"" (1991). Joaquin Phoenix (who was recently seen on screen as Lucius Hunt in M. Night Shayalman's ""The Village"" (2004) as Jack Morrison & John Travolta (who was recently seen on screen as Howard Saint in ""The Punisher"" (2004) as Mike Kennedy give the best performances of their careers. The cast which includes Jacinda Barrett (who was recently seen on screen as Steena Paulsson in ""The Human Stain"" (2003) as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut (who was recently seen on screen as Evan Fields in ""Breakin' All The Rules"" (2004) & as Gordon Mitchell in ""Anacondas: The Hunt For The Blood Orchid"" (2004) as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke & Balthazar Getty as Dennis & Ray Gauquin, is superb. The directing by Jay Russell (who directed ""My Dog Skip"" (2000) & ""Tuck Everlasting"" (2002) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Lewis Colick (who wrote the story & screenplay to ""Unlawful Entry"" (1992), ""Judgement Night"" (1993), ""Ghosts Of Mississippi"" (1996), & ""Domestic Disturbance"" (2001), which also starred John Travolta. He also wrote the screenplay to ""October Sky"" (1999) is excellent. The music by William Ross (who also did the music to ""My Dog Skip"" (2000), ""Tuck Everlasting"" (2002), both which were directed by Jay Russell, is excellent. The song at the end ""Shine Your Light"" by Robbie Robertson is excellent and heartwarming powerful. It is in sync of the movie's message. The cinematography by James L. Carter (who also did the cinematography to Jay Russell's ""My Dog Skip"" (2000) & ""Tuck Everlasting"" (2002) is excellent. The film editing by Bud S. Smith (who also film edited ""Flashdance"" (1983), ""The Karate Kid"" (1984), & ""Darkman"" (1990) & M. Scott Smith (who also film edited ""The Crow"" (1994) is excellent. The casting by Nancy Foy (who also did the casting, recently to ""Hidalgo"" (2004). She also did the casting to ""Blade II"" (2002), ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001), ""October Sky"" (1999), ""Doctor Dolittle"" (1998), ""Flubber"" (1997), ""Jumanji"" (1995), & ""The Rocketeer"" (1991) is excellent. The production design by Tony Burrough (who also did the production design to Jay Russell's ""Tuck Everlasting"" (2002). He also did the production design to ""The Santa Clause 2"" (2002), & ""A Knight's Tale"" (2001) is excellent. The art direction by Gregory Bolton (who also art directed ""Gods & Generals"" (2003), ""The Wedding Planner"" (2001), & ""The X-Files"" (1998), Kevin Constant (who recently art directed ""Hidalgo"" (2004) & ""The United States Of Leland"" (2004), He also art directed ""The Rookie"" (2002), & Paul D. Kelly (who recently art directed ""The Forgotten"" (2004) is excellent. The set decoration by Maggie Martin (who also set decorated ""Gigli"" (2003), ""Daddy Day Care"" (2003) & ""The Cable Guy"" (1996) is excellent. The costume design by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus (who also costume designed ""Dead Man Walking"" (1995) is excellent. This is a brilliant tribute to the hard working firefighters of 9/11, and basically, firefighters in particular. It is also a tribute to men and women who have lost their lives on 9/11. See it for yourself. It is powerful, smart, and excellent.",1096761600,,3189,5.09942638623327
2163756,5,B00063MAXQ,"For me, watching this movie was like being in the fire house and seeing what really goes on behind the doors.  To see the trials and tribulations that firefighters go through each day.  The adrenaline rush, the excitement, and the fear one feels when going into a burning building.  The euphoric feeling one has knowing that they saved someone's life.  This movie I feel is a true testament to what goes on in a fire house.  The joking, the uncertainties, and the losses.  I don't think anyone can truly understand what it feels like, unless you have been in the scorching heat of a fire and lived to tell about it.  This is a movie that shows the brotherhood of firefighters and the bond that they share.  This movie should be seen by those who run out of a burning building, those on the side lines watching, and for those who run in.  Never forget!",1096761600,2,851,4.438709677419355
2163757,5,B00063MAXQ,"This Is An Excellent Movie. I Just Saw It Today. It Has Alot Of Action(Fire Scenes). It Has A Great Set Of Actors, And They Did A Great Job Playing Their Roles. The Movie Also Has Alot Of Funny Humor In It. I Would Reccommend This Movie To Teenagers And Adults. It Is A Touching Movie Because It Could Be Like A True Story Thing.",1096675200,,329,4.076923076923077
2163758,5,B00063MAXQ,Ladder 49 is an excellent movie. It's a thriller along with a heartfelt ending that'll make you want to stand-up and applod. If I had been told this was based on a true story there's now doubt I wouldn;t of believed it!,1096675200,,219,4.238095238095238

2163760,5,B00063MAXQ,"I just saw this movie last night, it's one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! I think it shows the ""brotherhood"" that firefighters share very well. There will be ups and downs, but when it comes down to it, you know your ""brothers"" have your back. It had a good mix of action and romance. My brother is a firefighter, so I've seen the ""brotherhood"" first hand, but anyone who hasn't witnessed this, needs to see this movie, it will truely open your eyes. It also does a great job of showing how men and women in this line of work risk their lives every single day, to save people they don't even know. I'm definantly going to see this movie again!",1096675200,,659,4.196850393700787
2163761,5,B00063MAXQ,"When ""Ladder 49"" previews started being shown on TV, at the movies and on the internet, many people I talked to said that it would just be like an updated version of ""Backdraft""; myself, included.  Well, I saw this movie opening day and I'll tell you, this is not just a new ""Backdraft"".  Although that movie was good, I enjoyed ""Ladder 49"" much more.  I don't want to say too much because many people have not seen it, but I do highly reccommend this movie!!",1096675200,2,459,4.376470588235295
2163762,4,B00063MAXQ,"Where were you on September 11th, 2001? A little over three years ago, the world stood still as people from across the world witnessed one of the bloodiest and most horrific attacks on American soil by a foreign power. Images of the airplanes slamming into the World Trade Center towers, survivors trapped inside jumping to the ground below, flames rising from the wreckage of the Pentagon, and brave police and fire department workers searching the piles of debris for the remnants of their fallen comrades are ones that will forever be engraved in the minds of the courageous men and women of this beautiful country. And as the nation enters into the public debate of who is the better man to lead the United States in this tumultuous time in our history, one has to question whether the left side of the political spectrum has chosen to blot out the memories of this defining moment of our lives in order to conjure up a false September 10th mentality for political advantage or, to the more unlikely affect, to demonstrate the extremely short memories maintain. Whatever the case, we, as a nation, can not believe the foolish rantings of ""disingenuous filmmakers"" and their propaganda and simply ignore the memories of those that made the ultimate sacrifice - and further more to those that continue to lay their lives on the line for our protection.

The story for Ladder 49 centers on the events in the life of a firefighter who finds himself trapped in a horrific blaze struggling to escape and return to his family. Jack Morrison, just one of several dedicate firefighters of Ladder 49, one of Maryland's most prestigious and courageous firehouses, has spent the last ten years risking his life in order to save others. Though he has much to be grateful for - a loving wife, two beautiful children, and a dedicated group of co-workers and friends - Jack can't put off the feeling that he may be taking too much of a chance with his line of work. When he first started off at the firehouse, training as a rookie, he couldn't wait to get the call and spring into action putting out blazes and feel that adrenaline pumping. Then after meeting his future wife, Linda, and getting married, he begins to slowly rethink his line of work after a series of tragic circumstances. During what seems like another normal fire, Jack has to coup with the loss of his best friend, and the brother of one of another firefighter, eventually taking on his fallen comrades duties as a Truckee, a far more dangerous job then working the fire hoses. After the birth of his two children, another comrade of Jack's has his face horrifically damaged in a split-second accident. He finds himself so emotionally drained by the event that he can barely bring himself to visit his injured comrade, let alone bring his wife along and having her worry further about him. Jack then begins to question himself over whether he still feels the same way about his job as he did nearly ten years ago or not and if he should taken the position of captain's aide that has been offered to him. When he decides to continue working as a firefighter and saving the lives of those that truly need him, he finds himself trapped in a tremendous blaze that could very well bring his life to a sudden halt. The story for Ladder 49 is simply nothing short of astounding. There are just so few words to accurately describe the vivid emotions presented through this film's brilliantly crafted script. The image of Jack Morrison lying on the ground surrounded by flames and debris immediately following his rapid freefall descent down several floors of the burning building conjured up some of the most fervent memories of the aftermath of September 11th - an effect the filmmakers definitively wanted crossing the minds of the audience. In order to fully realize the movie's heart-warming and inspiration message, one must see the film for themselves.

Once again here is a clear demonstration that you don't need a tremendous amount of A-list talent, let alone a still not world renowned leading man, to create a truly emotionally loaded feature film to life. Joaquin Phoenix, who appeared earlier this year in the surprisingly disappointing The Village, without question immortalizes himself as a future leading man with his performance in this film. Though he had appeared in both Gladiator and Signs, two critically praised and publicly well-received blockbusters, Phoenix was known more as a co-star and failed to be seen in the form of a famous leading man up to this point. The entire performance of the film rests on Phoenix's shoulders, as the storyline focuses solely on the events in his characters life, and he never once faults in his emotionally dedicated role. John Travolta, whose career seems to have hit a bit of a slump as of late, returns in fantastic form with his role as Chief Kennedy, the captain of Ladder 49, who trains and watches over Phoenix's character over his ten year career. Though the film's primary focus is on Jack Morrison, the balanced mentor-protge relationship demonstrated through the film's nearly two hour time span offers. And, in all respects, Travolta is the man who holds the firehouse together - he brings them together when they're fighting, comforts them when are at a loss, and lifts them up when they need it most - it may not be the most original character in the book but, hey, why mess with success? The only disappointing aspect of the film when concentrating on the area of casting was the lack of originality when it came to each individual background character but this can easily be overlooked once you realize that Phoenix's performance is the only one that is suppose to have resounding effects.

Overall, Ladder 49 successfully draws Americans back to the emotionally draining days of three years ago when we saw the most courageous and dedicated individuals amongst us risk their lives in the pursuit of fulfilling their civic duty knowing full well that many of them weren't coming back. Though the issue of September 11th, and more specifically the deaths of the three-hundred and forty-three firefighters that were lost on that horrific day, is not dealt with specifically in this film, Ladder 49 does achieve its goal of bringing public awareness to the rigorous careers of those that put their lives on the line everyday to ensure our safety and by that creates renewed aspiration for its audience. There are those that are going to criticize the film for its lack of originality, which, frankly, is astounding considering a majority of critics praised Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow barely two weeks ago despite nearly the exact same flaw. Besides, any film that consistently and thoroughly has audience members either on the verge of crying or flat-out balling their eyes out, not only at its climatic ending but sporadically throughout the feature, should be given credit for pulling off an achievement that is so rare at the box office these days. At long last, firefighters are given the proper treatment on the silver-screen they have so long deserved, The job may not be the easiest, it may even be quite draining not only for them but for their loved ones as well, but, in the end, it is usually those occupations that turn out to be the most fulfilling because they know that they are doing something good in the world.",1096675200,2,7362,4.808997632202052
2163783,5,B00063MAXQ,Its a great movie. I recommend,1507766400,,30,4.166666666666667
2163784,3,B00063MAXQ,"From the very first we are immersed in explosive scenes as watch Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix), a well trained fire fighter is disregarding his own peril as he saves a man from the burning high-rise building. The inevitable happens and Jack is trapped in the burning debris. As his comrades rush to save him the rest of the film is a series of flash-backs from his rooky days until the present.

The story focus is on Jack Morrison's life and secondarily firefighting in general. Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) holds the team together. John Travolta is believable in the film.

Aside from the numerous clichs and shads of 9/11 this is a well done formula movie.

----------------------------------------------------------
The wide screen DVD was very clear on watching on the laptop. This film would be a good candidate for ""Superbit"".

There are some extras such as an audio commentary with director Jay Russell and Editor Bud Smith.

There is a lot of interesting backgrounds music to the various scenes. This soundtrack is available.",1504483200,,1044,5.081871345029239

I loved (and still do) ""Backdraft"" as well, but I'm talking ""Ladder 49."" The things that really make this film going are: seeing what firefighters do, personal lives (whether at home or at work), and that it makes the viewer think about the daily jobs that need to done whether out on a call or not on call.

I could tell you all about it but this is one movie you have to see for yourself. While I thought that Backdraft was good and it was , in some ways this one is even better. I think the chapters are more real and hold your attention better. I am a movie buff when I can say that.  I hardly ever see a movie that I don't like.

2163949,5,B00063MAXQ,"Today, two types of movies do justice for the firefighting profession:  any film portraying firefighters' efforts on 9/11 and this film.  Given that it takes place in Baltimore instead of New York City, it'd be kind of hard to incorperate the attacks.  But when this film came out back in 2004, it served as the perfect reminder that heroes aren't just the brave men and women who entered the towers on that September day in 2001, many of them making the ultimate sacrifice so that others may live, but that heroes are any firefighter who doesn't hesitate to jump on their rig at the sound of the alarm, ready to face whatever emergency situation they're headed for.  It's no big-budget action flick and not a billion-dollar drama, but that does not detract from this great film and it's important message.  I say watch it, enjoy it, wipe your eyes afterwards, and then remember all those who died on September 11th and all those who continue to answer the call for help to this very day.",1377993600,2,988,4.622857142857143

It's probably the only movie that caused me to cry in front of my friends. That was embarrassing. I think the guys I was hanging out with were actually more uncomfortable with it than I was.

I loved watching that part of the movie. Joaquin's character, Jack Morris makes the ultimate sacrifice. Really moving scene. We also see how tight knit these guys are and how they keep it light with a dangerous job.

As a hopeless romantic, one thing that truly touched me was the adorable shyness of Jack and his romance with the woman he met and soon married, played very well by Jacinda Barrett.

2163995,5,B00063MAXQ,"""Ladder 49"" gives those of us who've never stood close to the fire a peek at the lives of those underpaid and overworked civil servants who go out every day -- and may not return.

This is primarily a strong emotional drama about the bond between brothers (and sisters) in the service, not so much an action adventure or disaster film.  The story details the career of Jack (Phoenix) as he comes in a rookie Baltimore firefighter, meets his captain (Travolta), loses friends and gains a wife (Barrett).

Joaquin Phoenix is one of the strongest actors of his generation.  He can depict more with a gesture or two than many other actors can with an entire soliloquy. When he puts on the coat and the turnout boots, you forget he's an actor and think he's a firefighter in peril.

WARNING:  you need a box of tissues next to you while you are watching this film. It will pull on your heart and yes--make you want to thank the next firefighters you see.

2163996,3,B00063MAXQ,"I just saw Ladder 49 and I was kind of expecting a grittier more intense film, but this is quite the opposite. Instead, it is an in-depth look at the life of firefighter Jack Morrisson played by Joaquin Phoenix. It's the usual story of struggle to success, to tragedy, and finally one of hope as the credits begin to roll. Ladder 49 is a family film made for all the firefighters out there. It has it's predictable moments as family films tend to have. It has the firefighter who dies in the beginning, another one who gets badly injured, and the hero who sets the tone at the end. It's your typical firefighter genre film that seems a little repetitive and truly does not stand out as a classic film for years to come. As I said, don't expect this to be a gritty film ala Backdraft, but it does have it's moments that put a smile on your face. It's a movie void of a definitive plot, but about the lifespan of what a firefighter might deal with in his career.  We are put in the driver's seat of one firefighter as he takes us through when he first arrives at the firehouse, till his ultimate challenge towards the end.  And that's really the film in a nutshell.

They could have made a backstory as well(drugs, crooked firefighter) to keep the pace up and intrigue the audience a bit, but I believe the director clearly wanted to make this film about firefighting in general and the rollercoaster of emotions one particular firefighter and those close to him might go through on the job. Overall, it's a good family film with a sad ending that may or may not be suitable for pre-teens or anyone who has lost a relative fighting fires, without giving too much of the ending away.",1208131200,,1680,4.412903225806452
2163997,4,B00063MAXQ,"`Ladder 49' is tender and touching, a film that will tug at the heartstrings of just about anyone.  If you're not at least on the verge of tears by the time the credits begin to roll then you may want to check you're pulse.  That said, the weepy or sappy aspect of this movie at times can be a drawback, for it makes it come across overly sentimental and not quite `dramatic' enough to be realistic, but this is minor and for the most part the film connects well with the viewer.

It's a film that is designed to get at you, to make you weep in the heroic acts of our men in uniform and their tragic sacrifices for our safety and betterment.  In this respect it works quite well.  In fact when I saw this film in the theaters when it was released we happened to have our local fire department present and I sat next to a few of them and after the film closed, with tears in all of our eyes, we shook hands and embraced and I thanked them for their bravery.  This is the type of film that elicits your respect and heartfelt gratitude.

The film opens with a savage fire engulfing a tall building.  We are then introduced to the firefighters entering that building to rescue the men trapped inside.  Within moments we watch Jack Morrison (our obvious hero) fall through the collapsing floor and all is black.  Now we're in flashback mode and we get to watch Jack as he joins the fire department and we get to see everything that made him the hero we saw in the films blistering opening.  We watch Jack get embraced by his fellow firefighters, meet and fall in love with Linda, become a father, lose friends to the flame; all the while we know that he is lying on his back in rubble waiting to be rescued.

There are many moments within this film that work so beautifully.  One in particular has stayed with me for quite a long time.  There is a scene within the film where Jack Morrison and fellow firefighter Lenny Richter (Phoenix's `Walk the Line' costar Robert Patrick) receive medals of honor for rescuing a young girl from a devastating fire.  This scene alone touched me deeper than any other scene in the film, even the emotional ending.  It was simple, it was sincere and it was moving.  It wasn't overly sappy or forced.  It was a small act but watching that young girl hand them their medals was almost too much for me to bear up under.

One great draw to this film is the impressive action sequences.  The fire rescue missions are so realistic and breathtaking you feel as though you are there fighting the fire with them.  One scene in particular where Morrison is searching through a smoke filled apartment you feel almost suffocated by the fumes.  Director Jay Russell delivers beautifully in this respect.

`Ladder 49' owes a lot to the acting as well.  Phoenix is a little too `jolly' at times, kind of childish in the very beginning, but he grows into his character well.  The rest of the cast though doesn't have any problems grabbing hold of their character from the moment the step on the screen till the moment their presence is gone.  John Travolta, an actor I'm not generally impressed with, actually impressed me.  As the Captain he manages to infuse enough humor into his dramatic and almost parental performance that he becomes relatable and very likable.  Robert Patrick has perfected playing the jerk and he doesn't disappoint here.  A jerk with a heart.  Morris Chestnut is sorely underused, but he works well with what he's given.  The true standout here though is the beautiful Jacinda Barrett who delivers an award worthy performance as Linda, Jack's long suffering wife.  She portrays perfectly that mix of admiration and frustration with her husband's dangerous line of work.

When all is said and done `Ladder 49' accomplishes what it sets out to do.  It touches our hearts and makes us think about those men and women that risk their lives everyday so that we can feel safe.  At times it may tug a little too hard or a little too often but it's a forgivable misstep in a film that is so likable and moving you can't help but pardon its minor error.",1201737600,,4083,4.4938941655359566

2164000,3,B00063MAXQ,"You can just tell that this movie has oodles of good intention oozing from every pore, and taken as a whole, it does work as a tribute to the noble profession of firefighter.  However, the story arc covers no new ground, and cannot really be described in any way as multilayered - what you see is what you get.  Having said that, the director treats these predictable scenes in a sensitive way that involves you more than you might expect.
What you do get, is Joachin Phoenix' character injured and trapped in a large burning building, and as he waits for his rescue, we see his life unfold through flashbacks to key events, starting from when he first walks into the fire station as a probationary fire officer.  Told just that about the movie, you can probably guess where it goes... boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has first kid, boy has second kid, boy has bad things happen to colleagues, boy wonders if he is in the right job considering he now has family, boy realizes he loves his job and stays.  It's not particularly clever, and yet, at the end of the movie you will have an appreciation for the life of a fireman in a typical blue collar environment, which was surely the films goal in the first place.  John Travolta plays the father figure Captain of the station, adding little depth to the role, but Joachin Phoenix does a passable job, gaining plaudits at least for his willingness to get right into the thick of the action and look the part.  Apparently after training he became an honorary member of the firefighting team he trained with, even getting their tattoo.
If anything else raises the film from mediocrity, it is the firefighting scenes.  Not just that that they have been created realistically, but that they have a real flavour of realism about them - these smack of realistic situations for firefighters, and not scenes that are chosen purely for dramatic value.  The effects thankfully shy away from cgi, and the sound mix helps add to a feeling of being `inside' the fire.  Best of all, the movie does not rely on these scenes to keep your interest, but they become part of the character drama.
Interestingly, in the extras the deleted scenes do add some value - one plot line in particular which has one of the firefighters dealing with the loss of his brother through sinking into a spiral of drinking, shows both the emotional and mental strain of the job and the toll it takes, as well as the camaraderie of the firefighters that help him get through it.  Otherwise, the extras cover predictable ground, making of, tribute to firefighters etc.  Some of the scenes showing the cast going through firefighting school are moderately interesting.
All in all, a modest success, but one that somehow you can't help feeling should have had more to it, given the talent involved.  What it does achieve, is tackling not an action movie, but a sensitive character study, and why a man will run into a burning building, when everyone else is coming out.",1185926400,,2983,4.6394686907020875

2164003,5,B00063MAXQ,"First and foremost, this is a drama, not an action film, about firefighters, with the focus on one firefighter in particular. The film tells the story about the life this one firefighter, whose life is revealed in flashback, when he finds himself in a bit of difficulty while fighting a fire and engaging in a rescue. That singular moment in time is grounded in the context of his life as a firefighter. While the film may be said to be somewhat formulaic and predictable, it does not take away from the fine acting, the great fire fighting sequences, and the poignant and funny moments that occur throughout the film. In many ways it is reflective of life itself, with some highs and lows, as well as a ready, steady core of reality in which all is grounded.

The firefighter who finds himself in a quandary is Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix), a firefighter at a Baltimore firehouse. The viewer sees Jack in his rookie days as he is initiated into the brotherhood of firefighters and begins the bonding process with his fellow firefighters, whereby they become ""family"". Some of those bonding scenes are quite funny, especially the one involving his initial meeting with the then Captain of the firehouse, Mike Kennedy (John Travolta). Others are quite serious and poignant, as the dangers of the job are brought home to the viewer, especially when Jack loses a member of the brotherhood that is near and dear to him. The film shows, as the years go by, Jack's progression through the ranks from rookie to respected firefighter. It is clear that it is a job that he loves, despite the ever present danger to life.

As the viewer sees Jack's professional life unfold, the viewer also catches glimpses into Jack's personal life, from the moment that he meets his future wife, Linda (Jacinda Barrett), to the moment of their wedding and the birth of their children, with the wife and children also becoming part of the larger firefighter family or brotherhood. The film also shows the tremendous pressure and stress that a firefighter's job can have on one's spouse and children with their ever present concern for the safety of that beloved firefighter. After all, firefighters go where others dare not, simply so that others may live. The film shows how firefighters and members of their families cope with this ever present sword of Damocles that hangs over their respective heads.

Joaquin Phoenix, who is one of the finest young actors of his generation, gives a low key, but poignant, performance as the salt of the earth kind of guy who wants to do the best that he can for those whom he loves, in a job that he loves, with those with whom he loves working. He gives a quintessential portrayal of a working class guy for whom firefighting and family are concepts at the central core of his being. John Travolta gives a humorous and, at times, affecting performance as Mike Kennedy, the firefighting official who clearly is not above playing a practical joke on his firefighters but who pulls out all the stops to ensure that none are left behind when fighting a fire. Jacinda Barrett is effective in the role of Linda, the concerned wife who does her best to allay her fears and, over time, become supportive of her husband's chosen career. The rest of the supporting cast is equally effective in their respective roles.

This is a film that those who would like to sneak a peek into the life of a firefighter will appreciate. It will certainly let the viewer see the everyday types of situations that may confront a firefighter, as well as enable the viewer to discern why firefighters form such close relationships with each other. After viewing this film, a viewer can certainly walk away with an understanding as to why firefighters are such a unique brotherhood and why they bond as they do. It takes a special person, indeed, to walk into a towering inferno. This film does firefighters proud, and my hat is certainly off to firefighters everywhere. It is with good reason that we, in The Big Apple, call our firefighters New York's bravest.",1174867200,3,4052,4.751420454545454

While generally praised, that praise is here often tempered with comments like ""predictible story line""; ""uninspired plot"", etc.. Only somebody suffering from postmodern malaise could be indifferent to this movie. The hero is humble, the action varied and intense, the story line relecting the aspirations of millions of Americans. I think what must blanch for those suffering from postmodernity is the hero is not a homosexual, and that he has a happy married life with two kids and dog. THAT is what THEY consider to be ""quaint"" or ""predictable"". If you are a humble, God-fearing, decent human being you will probably love this movie. If you prefer a less ""predictable"" life like searching gay bars for sex with men, or alleys for sex with stray animals, than you probably won't like this movie.",1163462400,6,888,4.887417218543046
2164006,1,B00063MAXQ,"Hey, you know something?  You know those guys that jump into burning buildings and rescue people? Do you know they happen to be rather brave?

Well, if you did, you can walk away now because you've basically seen the entire point behind ""Ladder 49: Firefighters Are So Brave, Aren't They?""

Call me a cynic all you want, but I want the movies I watch to have a little more story than that. Oh, wait - OK. Come back - there IS a story behind Ladder 49 after all. It's just not a very good one.

So, Brave Firefighter Joaquin Phoenix joins up with other Brave Firefighters, and the majority of the movie is centred around them, and the ha-ha-larious ""manly"" antics they get up to, including an ""induction"" ceremony that only the most stupid, gullible people in the UNIVERSE would fall for, and throwing beer kegs over one another. 'Cos they're guys, see? And all the while the worst possible fires break out (with no explanation why.. Jeez, you'd think there would be some little fires or cats to rescue from trees or something?) and every time Joaquin's moaning wife's worried face is shown because she's sure he's going to die THIS time.

And that's basically it. The thing is, the characters are so bland and uninspired, the plot so Cut-Out-And-Keep that we can't help but feel we've seen this sort of thing a thousand times before. Its more like a mid-afternoon TV movie than a big budget blockbuster, and having great actors like John Travolta and Robert Patrick in dull co-worker roles is such a waste of their talents that it beggars belief.

Big stars, big money - on a movie that's as exciting as a ladder in a pair of tights. A real waste.

2164008,3,B00063MAXQ,"Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta star in ""Ladder 49"", a look at the lives, loves, highs, lows and laughs of a team of Baltimore firefighters, plus a few of the fires themselves. Though it brought my girlfriend to tears by the end, it didn't grab me nearly as much. Its watchable enough though.

The film focuses on Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) and his life at the firestation, from when he first joined (with all the pranks his fellow firefighters pull on him and each other) through the courtship and marriage of his wife (Jacinda Barrett), the birth of his children and the loss of close friends to the flame, whether by death or injury. My little brother called it a ""manly chick flick"". I didn't really see it that way, but I know where he's coming from. During the course of the movie, Jack and his firefighting have friendships tested, relationships strained and face tough decisions, coming out all the more stronger for it. I could see it all in the film, though found it a bit hard to connect, to feel what the guys were going through. The film just kind of drifted along.

""Ladder 49"" is one of those films whose scenes don't exactly play in chronological order, which I usually find a bit confusing and unnecessary. The film begins with firefighter Jack getting caught in a building in the midst of a fire, then flashes back to when he first joined the firefighters, then back to the rescue efforts, and back and forth through his life. It kind of reminded me of the story structure of ""Catch Me If You Can"", which begins with Frank Abagnale Jr (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) in jail, then flashes back to before he had committed any crimes. Never really liked the whole ""how does his life lead to this?"" angle. The dialogue bothered me a little too, it felt a little wooden. Maybe it was the writing, maybe it was the delivery, maybe it was a bit of both, hard to say.

Special features include deleted scenes, a few behind the scenes featurettes, a featurette about real life firefighters and an audio commentary. Pretty standard really.

If you enjoyed this film, I recommend ""Backdraft"", a 1991 firefighting film directed by Ron Howard.",1150588800,2,2154,4.645669291338582

2164011,5,B00063MAXQ,"Being that I am a firefighter myself (CFD), I do have to point out a few sticking points. For starters, the prop guy cut out the mask part of the breathing apparatus, on MSA Equipment or any SCBA system, you ALWAYS have a mask over your nose and mouth. Not only that, his initial technique in fighting fire more than likely would upset the thermal balance, and was unnececary, given that the flames weren't rolling overhead. Also, you never, NEVER NEVER F-ING EVER do anything alone, two in two out EVERY TIME!

However...

Other than little stuff like that, overall a good picture of what being a firefighter really is like. Sometimes its mundane, sometimes its intense, but its always neccecary. Every emotion shown and portrayed is very true, some of it has happend to me (thank god I haven't lost anybody with me while on duty). Overall, its a good peek into our world, the ups and downs, the pranks, good times, hardships, excitement and adrenaline, everything that we do and go through on a day to day basis, well most of it, I wish they would have shown the washing of gear that takes umpteen million hours after a working fire.

These firemen go into situations that no one else would. They truly are heroes but they do not think they are heroes.  The question the movie continues to ask is why do some people run in to burning buildings while others are running out?  A little romance -- Joaquin falls in love and gets married in this movie.  John runs what he calls his house (the fire station) and what a great job he does.  I think this is the movie that woke me up and I had to ask who is this guy Joaquin Phoenix and why don't we see him in more films?

The film is amazingly accurate in its portrayal of the commaraderie between the firefighters, from their stationhouse pranks, to their extended family relationships with each other.  It is also faithful to the emotional baggage that every firefighter must cope with.

They are on their way to save a person or a building ...and let's hope it's not someone or someplace you know. They will enter a burning building as everyone else flees it. This is the message those that made LADDER 49 want you to come away with after watching the movie. And it's a good message. Firemen deserve our respect ...especially after so many were lost during the 9/11 attacks. They are brave, strong, dedicated, pranksterish, and heroic...

But that's only part of the story. And it's only part of what is covered in this myopic film.

Joaquin Phoenix (WALK THE LINE, 2005) stars as Jack Morrison, an injured veteran firefighter trapped inside a burning inferno who flashes back on his life in the fire service. We are re-introduced to him as he arrives for his first day of work on ladder truck 49. He meets his Captain, Mike Kennedy (John Travolta, GET SHORTY, 1995) and the rest of his new extended family as they play jokes on him and generally induct him into their midst using every prank one could think of (finding a live goose in his locker was nice one).

As the movie progresses, we watch some of Jack's fellow firefighters die or get injured as Jack climbs the ""ladder"" of rank and prestige within this close-knit brotherhood. We also see him get married, have kids, move from the ladder truck to search-and-rescue, and receive medals for saving lives. And then we get to watch him suffer a terrible fall which leads us back to his life's flashbacks.

______________________________________________________________________________

Having worked with firemen for many, many years, I can tell you that much of what was shown in LADDER 49 is true. But, like I said earlier, there is much more to firemen than simple heroics and the golden light of prestige. Firemen have one of the highest divorce rates among any profession (Policemen being #1). They also often battle alcoholism (something that is only touched on in this film).

Their academies train them well, so a Captain would NEVER go in with a rookie on his first fire. EVER! That was pretty ridiculous.

This film is good for what it is: an obvious praise for firemen. And if that's what you want to see, this'll be a great film to watch. But there are better, more relevant firemen related screen versions out there. Most notably is the new RESCUE ME on cable starring Dennis Leary. This new series is not afraid to show the good and bad psychological aspects many firefighters find themselves in. And Ron Howard's BACKDRAFT is a pretty even take on them as well.",1135382400,2,2755,4.703319502074689
2164017,3,B00063MAXQ,Ladder 49 is a touching story about a fire fighter in Maryland.  It`s the story of one characters desire to fight fires and help people despite the risk of dying and not being there to help his family.  It`s an okay movie.  Perhaps good for a date.,1134864000,,248,4.23404255319149
2164018,4,B00063MAXQ,"I would recommend this movie Ladder 49 to anyone who is interested in fire fighting or who likes to enjoy a great movie. In the movie Ladder 49 I believe that the flash backs that the main character has is symbolizing his death. I believe this because the way the filmmakers use and arrange the movie angles and shots. The filmmakers also take advantage of the technology like CGI (computer graphic imaging) was able to make the audience fell like they are in the movie with the characters. Therefore, I think that people who enjoy a movie with a little action and a love story twist would enjoy this movie.

 My experience of the movie was brought to me when I watched this movie titled Ladder 49 at my house on May 15, 2005 in Kodiak, Alaska. Since the first time I watched this movie I was amazed by the time and effort the filmmakers had put into this movie. By all the shot angles and CGI in the film made me watch this great film many times since my first viewing pleasure.

 The first thing that I noticed in this movie was the variety of camera angles and shot through the movie. After watching the movie these shots and angles that are used in the movie help the audience become more attached to the main character in this movie. From these areas we as an audience feel his happiness and again his pain when he or his friends are hurt from there occupation.

Also the major part of film making that I noticed was the use of CGI in this movie. The use of the CGI was used so well that the picture or scenes with the CGI was so well developed that it seem as we where there in the action. For an example the opening scene of the movie when the large building is on fire my experience to the movie was that it felt as if I was with the fire fighters. When the fire fighters arrived to the burning building in their fire trucks and when the search and rescue team went in to make sure that there is no other people in the building. The filmmakers did a get job in developing and perfecting the scene when the main character Jack Morris falls threw the floor a couple of stories. Then from the quality of filming we feel his pain as he hits the ground.

 Therefore, I think that people who enjoy a movie with a little action and a love story twist would enjoy this movie. For the director whom made this movie Ladder 49 made a movie on the life as a fire fighter with action of doing his job. But ever the less adding a love story that involves the main character which I believe makes this movie so dramatically and enjoyable to watch. But the audiences who don't like seeing breath taking or horrifying scene with the risks and hazards of this profession should not watch this film. But an addition to the misfortunate scenes of fire fighters being burned this movie was very exceptionally good in all aspects of the film techniques and elements. I would recommend any film student for watch with film for the use of the many elements of filmmaking in Ladder 49.",1134518400,,2968,4.317773788150808
2164019,3,B00063MAXQ,"When a battle against a fire goes wrong at a critical moment, fireman Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) is sent into the middle of the chaos alone, with only thoughts of his past to keep him company until help arrives. Jack remembers his first days as a rookie at the firehouse with his firefighting brothers (including Robert Patrick, Morris Chestnut, Billy Burke, and Balthazar Getty), his marriage to Linda (nicely played by Jacinda Barrett, 'The Human Stain'), the children they have together, and his special bond with his captain (John Travolta), who arrives on the scene heartbroken that Jack is the one the company must save this time.

'Ladder 49' doesn't disappoint when it comes time to get the audience into the fire.  However, these sequences do not define what makes 'Ladder' such a special film. There's a deeper story here, which involves a healthy dose of tragedy that grabs you faster than any orange ball of flame ever could, and that's the best way to dramatize the hard work of the firefighter.

Director Russell seeks to humanize Joaquin Phoenix's firefighter and does an effective job despite total reliance on obvious formula.  We see early on Phoenix's pal die in a fire, and how the station reacts.  Travolta is station chief and we can easily picture how he would react to a dire ending, of the film's protaganist.  There is one simple scene, when fate unfold for a particular character.  Phoenix's simple reaction is crushing...you will know the scene when you see it.

2164023,2,B00063MAXQ,"Story telling is an art, whether it is on the canvas, the page or on the screen.  What makes engaging art and entertainment is conflict, juxtaposition, grit.  This film had none; no slightly discordant note to throw the characters into a deeper and more real relief.  These were cardboard cutouts in a post 911 hallmark moment.

Our lead character Jack Morrison is ""simple goodness"" and even his later conflicts with his wife over his job do not ring true, or add any depth to his character.  A classic and well drawn ""hero"" overcomes obstacles and internal conflicts to find his redemption in the end.  A good hero has his moments of anger while Jack seemed to be on valium for the better part of the film.

Faring perhaps worse was John Travolta in his role of Captain Mike Kennedy.  It was a caracature of the crusty and yet avuncular senior officer with a heart of gold.  it was a throwaway role for an actor who has had fine film moments ""Battlefield Earth"" not withstanding.

I wanted more from the film.  I wanted events as they played out to effect Jack Morrison more, deepen his character and add dimension.  But I but found them glossed over in a way they are not in real life; where traumas set the stage for stress disorders, alcoholism, and brokenness.  And at the same time one will get better drama if the hero finds redemption in something/anything after walking through the flames of hell, whether personally or externally inflicted.

This was a simple paean with little depth and I could not bring myself to care about the characters since they really showed no emotional life that would engage the discerning viewer.

Although its chief selling point is its spectacular - but never hyperbolic - fire sequences, ""Ladder 49"" is actually at its most compelling when it focuses on the struggle firemen go through trying to balance their high risk occupation with their role as husband and father.

In addition to Phoenix, who brings a self-effacing strength and heroism to his character, there are fine performances by John Travolta as the captain of the station, and Jacinda Barrett as Phoenix's understanding but understandably concerned wife.

In the first half of the film, the screenplay threatens to erupt into a raging inferno of stereotypes and cliches, as the characters take an occasional time out from firefighting for puppy love romance at the supermarket, frat boy antics at the fire station and domestic squabbles involving neglected wives and children at the old homestead.  But about halfway through the film, the deeper themes rise to the surface and ""Ladder 49"" begins to explore complex issues in a mature way.  The quiet scenes between Phoenix and Travolta, and Phoenix and Barrett are surprisingly subtle, thoughtful and intelligently written.

2164027,5,B00063MAXQ,"This is the kind of movie most of us say we want Hollywood to make.  It is about character, heroes who do things professionally instead of mental patients who take too many risks and can outrun explosions (right...).  While the movie has its action sequences with flames, helicopters, and tragic injuries, it is less about these scenes than the kind of people who do this work for us.  You know the clich, they run into the burning building while we scurry out.  It is clich, but true.

The movie opens with a huge concrete building in flames.  Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) and his fellow firefighters are trying to find some people on the upper floors.  As Jack lowers one of them to the ground in a rather realistic and heroic way, the floor beneath him gives way and he falls.  Of course he is injured and the movie now cuts between his present situation with his friends trying to get him out of there and his career as a firefighter.

We meet Jack as a rookie coming into Ladder 49 (his firehouse).  Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) is his Captain and sees to Jack's training.  We get to know these men and their fellow firefighters by their interactions at the fire station as well as their professional work in a very dangerous job.  We see their earnest and simple motivations for their work and how they react when the alarm calls them to action.

Frankly, I would have like to have seen more of their training and how that came into play during the fires, but we do see how firefighters work and the dangers they face.  It isn't just the flame and the smoke, but the structures are falling to pieces and they never know when something will give way, shift, or explode.

We see Jack progress in his career, how he builds his family, and the strain he (and his family) faces when his friends are injured and killed (I can't even hint at who or how).  There is more than enough heroism in this movie to go around.  But it is never overdone and I was glad that they honored the profession by keeping the action within bounds.  Obviously, certain concessions are made for Hollywood, but this is not so much an action flick as an affectionate portrait for these heroes.

Good family flick. The movie doesn't make much of the violence and gore is not shoved in your face.  The language is surprisingly clean for a fire house and the hijinks are more on the level of a summer camp than depraved.

I cannot, and will not, give away this film by telling you everything that happens as other reviewers do. No slight to them, but this is a flim of emotion. And to give away all that happens, would taint the feeling this film gives the viewer.

At first, I wasn't accepting of John Travolta as the fire chief. On 2nd and 3rd viewing, I came to see why he was chosen for the role. He NEEDED to be the supporting character. It was the only way it would work. And he does work as the fire superindent. Not to mean is is simply supporting...he is an integral part of the story. But it is Juaquin Pheonix who so centers this flick.

It is sad that it took something as drastic as 9/11 to make most of us appreciate the hard work that firefighters put in each and every day (there is a deleted scene about 9/11 that alludes to this).  However, with that in mind this is an excellent tribute to firefighters.  By no means is this an action movie that you watch just for the ""riveting plot.""  It is a character study with many emotional moments--both tearful and joyful.

The content shouldn't really be objectionable as the worst consists of some mild foul language and some fire-fighting scenes that might be intense to younger viewers.

There are five deleted scenes (including the 9/11 one mentioned above) but several are a bit rough.

My Dad never talked much about his Job, once in his later years he remarked that what hurt him most was finding kids afterwards who didn't make it out of a fire. Most of what he experienced he just kept to himself. Like Jack, I guess he didn't want to worry us and it seemed that he wasn't home all that much over the years.

The list of movies that maybe should never have been made.  The list of movies that make you wonder how many people lost their jobs after it's release.  The list now includes Ladder 49.  Actually, if you liked Pearl Harbor or Windtalkers this movie might be for you.  What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie?  Brave, dying (oops, dead!) firefighter relives his life as a firefighter through a series of cliched, tortuously edited flashbacks.  If you're into actors not-at-their-best, this movie's for you.  If you're into rah-rah-go-Police/Firefighters/EMT's for the sake of the rah-rah then this is your movie.  If you like being patronized and told what to think and how to feel you have GOT to see this movie.  If you don't like things getting in the way of your enjoyment of the movie, things like plot, storyline, decent editing, then BUY THIS NOW!!!  Just so everyone knows, I truly admire and respect all of our first responders.  That's why I kinda hate this movie as I see it as being a greater disservice than no movie at all.  Anyone want this?  I'll send it to you for the cost of shipping and send over a bonus DVD of my choosing just to get it out of my collection (bought it on the recommendation of a friend- never again)  Please don't pay money for this.",1119830400,7,1691,4.369774919614148

2164038,4,B00063MAXQ,"(3.5 STARS)  Originality is not what you find in 'Ladder 49' of which script could be much better.  It is sincere attitudes of the film toward the firefighters that are really remarkable about this film, which is greatly helped by the excellent acting from Joaquin Phoenix as Jack Morrison.

The film is mainly about Jack's life, or his growing up from a novice to an experienced firefighter.  It also shows the dedicated activities of the firefighters in Baltimore, some of which lead to tragic results.  However, the most realistic part in 'Ladder 49' is not burning fire itself, but the descriptions of the everyday life of Jack Morrison and his collegues at the firehouse.

Besides terrific Phoenix, the film features John Travolta, Jacinda Barrett, Morris Chestnut, Robert Patrick, Balthazar Getty, Jay Hernandez, and Billy Burke.  Among them, John Travolta and Robert Patrick provide the strongest performance.

As I said before, the story is not strong.  Though the script tries to present round characters, sometimes referring to the cultural background of the firefighters, the plot seems generic, especially when it handles with the husband-wife relation part in Jack's life.  Some characters are very flat, and even the skillful actors like Balthazar Getty remain unmemorable.

But I like the sinceity deeply felt in the film, and the horrible fire that burns down the buildings is convincingly made.  Perhaps what we need is a documentary about the firefighters.  (Is there any?  If there is, let me know.)  Until then 'Ladder 49' will be a good tribute to them.",1119312000,2,1574,5.117647058823529

When Joanquin's character gets trapped in a building he has time to refect on his life as a firefighter and his life with his family and friends. This movie was a wonderful depiction of what firefighters do and how they risk their lifes to save others. How they put others infront of themselves and their families. John Travolta was a great choice for the role of chief in this film. He has a serious but funny side and the emotion that he showed throughout the movie was believable. This movie was one of the better movies this year. But behold make sure you have a box of soft tissues next to you because you will need it. This movie has some really teary moments and you need to be prepared. But after watching this movie I respect and honor the jobs our firefighter and even police officers indure on a regular basis to keep us safe. This movie does a great job all round. Music was great also. The DVD has some great extra features I reccomend watching also. I salute  Ladder 49 and its cast for a job well done. Worth watching.,1119052800,2,1130,4.4326923076923075
2164041,5,B00063MAXQ,"This movie was the most shocking film I saw last year.  I was not expecting this to hit me the way it did.  This film is so touching, so moving.  The performances by the stellar cast (Phoenix, Trovolta and Barrett) were above superb.  The story revolves around Jack Morrison (Phoenix) as he reflecs about his life as a fire fighter while he lies in rubble in a burning building awaiting his rescue.  The movie is done in flashbacks as we watch Jack get welcomed to the fire house by fellow fighters as well as his captian Mike Kennidy (Trovolta).  We watch him gain respect, help put out his first fire, meet and fall in love with Linda (Barrett) and eventually marry her, wittness the birth of his children, the death of his best friend and even save a life or two... (the scene where he recieves his medal of honor will bring quite a few tears to your eyes)  Phoenix was by far at his best here, but the scene stealer to me was Barrett who played his wife.  The mastered the loving, concerned wife perfectly (much like Rennee did in Ciderella Man)  The entire film is built to make you feel proud and depressed all at the same time.  When my wife and I saw this movie we actually watched it with a few of the fighters for the Fort Worth F.D. and I sat next to one of them who pretty much bawled the whole movie.  I thought this movie was amazing, pretty darn close to perfect actually.  And this brings me to my question...What the crap happened come oscar time?  I would have EXPECTED at least an actor nod for Phoenix...I mean come on, after his snub for Gladiator he at least deserved the nod.  and what about Barrett...she had a supposrting actress nod in her stars and come oscar time she was robbed...oh well...at least they are remembered, and it doesn't hurt to know you had people gunning for you.",1118793600,2,1808,4.374251497005988

What I really liked about this film is the friendship of the all the lads working in the fire station. It really brought the warm hearted comedy into the story.

Whats also really moving are the tragic scenes coz all the workers are so close and they try so hard to keep eachother alive when there on the job. Plus the progression in the film also... the more the film goes the more you see of the lads and their families gettin closer and closer...over the ten year period.

This was an entertaining film and it has NOTHING to do with 9/11. That was the first thing that came to mind when it first came out and when I finally got around to seeing it I was pleasently suprised......",1118448000,,830,4.2075471698113205
2164044,3,B00063MAXQ,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT 9-11 AND DOES NOT TRY TO PROFIT OFF OF IT, AS SOME HAVE STATED.  IT IS A MOVIE ABOUT A FIREMAN AND HIS CAREER.  BUT, AREN'T THERE ANY FEMALE FIRE FIGHTERS ON THE FORCE?

This is a mildly entertaining movie about the first 10 years of the career of a firefighter, told in flashbacks. It is not a bad movie, I just didn't find it very engrossing.  It all seems like a superficial look at firefighting.

You do get to learn things you probably didn't know about fire stations.  Like, there are different specialities among the the firemen.  You get a superficial look at the technology, but there is no real in depth look.

The movie focuses on one fireman, his family life and his drive to be a fire fighter.  But, it is a superficial look.  You don't really understand why he was so driven.  You also don't understand what the connection is between him and his wife.  There is are a couple of deleted scenes that would have helped establish that, and I think the movie would have been better if there were included.

The film does cover some interaction between the lead characters and the other fire fighters, but this is also superficial.  His best friend gets killed.  But, you don't realize who gets killed or that he was the best friend until they come out and tell you later.  You have no idea what the connection is between the two or that they were even friends.

There are some real melodramatic fireman cliche's in the movie.  All the things you would expect:  death of friend, bad injury of another, family tensions, etc.

The ending was dragged out too long, with a horrible song from Robbie Robertson (ex-leader of the band).  This might be the worst thing he has done.  It is one of those ballads you would hear from someone like Bryan Adams.

Despite all this, the movie was entertaining throughout.  The movie didn't go overboard on the fire fighting cliches.  There was the one mean fireman, but this wasn't overplayed.  While there was some family strife, the wife was mostly supportive.  There were the pranks, but they weren't mean spirited.

The fire fighting scenes were good, but not memorable.  They were not heart pounding, but were somewhat exciting.

The extras are a 20 minute ""making of"" feature and 5 deleted scenes.  The movie would have been better if they left a couple of those scenes in.

I liked that the film makers had the courage to delete the 9-11 scene.  This movie is not about 9-11 and including that scene would have been a distraction to the real intent.  Unfortunately, that was one of the few scenes that did help develop the relationship between the man and wife.",1118188800,,2634,4.5576923076923075
2164045,5,B00063MAXQ,"I found this film to be surprisingly brilliant as it really gave you a front row sit into what theses brave fire-fighters do. The experience will leave you shocked and more opened eyed on what these men do everyday.

The storyline is based around one main character Jack (Phoenix) which at the start of the movie he is trapped in a burning building. As he starts having flash backs on his life, like his first day joining the fire department and up to were his gotten. John Travolta character is as chief of the department, he plays the part very well as he is only a small character in this amazing story.

I feel that this movie will make you look up to the fire fighters and realise that the job they do is extremely dangerous.

His girfriend, wife and mother of his kids is underplayed and I thought that Jacinda Barrett could have been given more to work with. Yet this is a post 911 paean to those men and women who rush into burning buildings to save our butts and in that regard, not much else is needed.

Travolta does an as usual excellent job, knowing his place. Like Gere in 'Unfaithful' the story is not about him and he never oversteps his bounds. He's like an ancient soothsayer, making sense of all the chaos.

I especially like the ""For the Love of The Game"" style of telling a present tense story with fairly (when done well) seamless flashbacks. You'll shed a few tears but you won't be disappointed. You can bring the kids. They'll love the goose scene. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1117929600,2,944,4.547058823529412
2164047,5,B00063MAXQ,"I have for the most part avoided any film about and/or inspired by the attacks of September 11 -- they've all just seemed so exploitational.  For the longest time I lumped Ladder 49 into that category.  Recently, a friend convinced me to watch the film and I'm glad I did.  This film is one of the best I've seen about firefighters.  Often, when you see films like this they present the characters as these superhuman-like heroes.  Ladder 49 shows us that firefighters are not superhuman heroes, but brave, fallible people who engage in activities that are, at time, heroic.  Not because they have this huge ego or want to act like something more than they are, but because they have a desire to help people in danger.  I applaud the film for giving a balanced picture of the good and bad involved in being a firefighter. Joaquin Phoenix's performances as Jack is simply wonderful, one his best in a very long time.  Even John Travolta's mostly supporting role is well done.  We get to see Jack's life in the form of flashbacks as he tries to survive a bad fire situation and when the end comes, Phoenix captures Jack's heroism is such a subtle and low-key way that you can't help but be emotional.  The real surprise, I thought, was Jacinda Barrett's quiet, but emotional, performance as Jack's wife, Linda.  Who would have thought a former ""MTV Real World"" participant could be that good.  I highly recommend this film.",1117324800,,1421,4.662650602409639
2164048,5,B00063MAXQ,"I kind of resisted seeing this movie because I thought it would be an action-packed, testosterone-fest, but I found out that wasn't true when a friend lent me her copy and a box of kleenex. I really felt connected to the characters to care about them, which doesn't happen in many movies, and I guess that's why I spent a fair amount of time blubbering into my boyfriend's shoulder. I like how Jack is flashing back over his life when he is trapped, I think it is more dramatic than going through the same sequence chronologically. Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance that will haunt me for a very long time, this is a career movie for him. Jacinda Barrett and John Travolta also give stirring performances.

One thing kind of ticked me off though when Kennedy is outside and tells Jack he has to crawl around debris to a control room where the rescue team will rendezvous with him. Huh? The guy fell who knows how far, is hurt, in a fire without a mask and now he has to do that? But God love Jack, he does it without complaint, because that's how much he loves his job and respects Kennedy, who was basically his mentor and father-figure in the department.

It doesn't have a happy ending, as young Linda's worst nightmare comes true, but it brings home the real dangers of the job and those that are sometimes left behind. A very touching story, I liked it",1117238400,2,1359,4.453815261044177

2164050,2,B00063MAXQ,"I didn't feel any sense of brotherhood between these men.  And the plot and entire movie just fell flat for me.  It was a cliched portrayel of the profession, cliched life of a man (becomes rookie firefighter, marries immediately, has a boy, then a girl, bbq's with other firefighters at his house etc.).  Just a boring salute to firefighting.

Firefighting gentlemen, deserved BETTER.  A better screenplay would have been a good start.  A more tragic or moving death would be have been good.  One that made me care more than an ounce.  You could see this truck coming a mile away.",1116720000,2,581,4.683168316831683

A review of the main character's life is the sole ""story"".  This is a sharp contrast to the much more engaging and dramatic ""Backdraft"".

The fire scenes are fine, but again they were probably more interesting in Backdraft.",1116460800,3,386,4.4714285714285715
2164052,5,B00063MAXQ,"This is what you call an honest-to-goodness description of what goes on in the lives of brave firefighters.  The movie contains no Soap Opera material or love triangle nonsense.  There are no invincible, James Bond type firemen running around putting out infernos all by themselves.  Rather, the plot centers around the daily struggles of people in the firefighting business;  both in their professional as well as their personal lives.

Joaquin Phoenix proves that he is up to the task of playing a very likable character.  Unlike most of the characters portrayed by John Travolta, the captain of the firehouse is only slightly nuts (as opposed to completely nuts!).  The acting is splendid all-around & I did not notice any weaknesses in that department.

While there are some spectacular scenes in LADDER 49, I liked the fact that the filmmakers did not try to get TOO extreme and caught up in making far-fetched heroic scenes.  I would think that every episode depicted in the film would have a counterpart mirrored in real-life.  For once, there is a movie about courage that is not ""Hollywoodized"" beyond belief.

Another nice touch is that the story takes place in Baltimore.  As most movies of this type take place in either New York, Chicago or LA, it was good to see a different American city portrayed on film.  Even better, in the Special Features the DVD contains interviews and commentary with real Baltimore firemen & their families.  Nicely done.

I readily admit that I am not a fireman myself.  However, I can't help but think that this movie speaks for a great many firemen across the country.  I would be mortified to find out that firemen could not relate to at least some aspects of this story.  I can't think of a higher compliment to pay this movie than that.

So, here is the bottom line.  If you enjoy movies about firemen and / or heroism, pick up this DVD.  If, on the other hand you dislike movies about firefighters, then pick up this movie.",1115942400,2,1971,4.738235294117647
2164053,5,B00063MAXQ,"Maybe am a little Bias, but my family descends from a long line within the fireservice: Great Grandfather, grandfather, dad, mom, brother and myself. Maybe that is why ladder 49

struck such a chord inside me.

Ladder 49 opens with Jaquin Pheonix racing into a burning warehouse with word that somewhere within the inferno are two possible survivors. When the situation shifts for the worst, Pheonix's character is haunted by the memories of a loving family outside the blaze.

 What follows in this scene and continues throughout the film, are arguably some of the most intense fire-situations ever captured for a movie. Most people may think of Backdraft, a Ron Howard film, but to me Backdraft had way too many unbelievable flaws to be realistic and ended up being just a good action flick. (Example - to name one - Firefighters racing

into a burning building full of smoke, with nothing but their eye visors flipped down. Reason? They said we, the audience wouldn't be able to tell the difference between actors. Realism...or star power... hm, tough choice. This viewer would rather see intensity of an actual situation, rather than the glitz of a well-makuped actor. What has young Mr Baldwin done since Backdraft again? I keep forgetting.) Climbing off soapbox.

I sometimes catch myself throwing this phrase around loosely, but with this I have no doubt, Ladder 49 is one of the 50 best films I have ever seen in my lifetime. John Travolta gives one of his most sincerest performances as a firechief (as my dad was) trying to protect his men, both at work and home. The supporting cast is excellent and I believed every minute of what I was watching. This coming from someone who has spent their entire life around the fire hall.

The dvd is spectacular. The dolby digital home theater sound mix couldn't be better. Deep rumblings, wisping flames, spewing steam, and violent explosions rain throughout. The only thing keeping me from from the action, was room temperature. What a

great mix! The video quality is excellent as well; deep blacks and bright flames are well defined and skin tones are natural with crisp details staying true to the directors vision.

Ladder 49 is a brilliant and moving film, capturing the brotherhood, heartbreaks, and plentiful adrenaline rushes of

working in the fire industry. I was a dispatcher for 2 years, the real heroes are the remaining members of my family I mentioned above. I wish we could give the pro-athletes 30 grand a year and give the millions to our firefighters and paramedics. They deserve it. ~SAOS~",1115596800,8,2561,4.880184331797235

2164056,5,B00063MAXQ,"I looked forward to seeing this film, though I didn't expect it to amount to much. I never saw ""Backdraft"", so I can't compare the two...but this film struck me in a way I didn't expect. I actually cried when the movie was over (it was that powerful!). Very few movies actually bring me to tears (only ""Casualties of War"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Field of Dreams"" and ""The Passion"" have that ""honor""), so that was quite a feat.

I loved how the film played along two story lines...the action with the big warehouse fire that opens the film, and the backstory, as Joaquin Phoenix thinks back over his life, in a sort of ""life review"". We see episodes from when he first showed up at the firehouse to start his job. I loved the pranks that guys played on one another. Being a veteran of the Navy, I found those little things quite accurate in how guys interract with one another, testing the limits of one's sense of humor. I also liked the detail of seeing rats scurry down the stairs to get away from the fire. Its small details like that which really enhanced the authenticity of the film for me.

The film shows how the dangers of the job can strain a marriage and scar children with worry, how accidents can happen that change people's lives, and how the guys stick together as a team. Firefighting is one of those jobs that will never go out of existence, so its important work, at somewhat little pay and benefits. After 9/11, a film like this needed to be made, and several characters made the point throughout the film: what possesses a guy to run into a burning building when everyone is running out?

I loved the music in this film, both the score and the pop songs that play in various scenes. I'd recommend the soundtrack as well. When the film reaches its climax, I was stunned by the direction it took, the bravery of the filmmakers to go in that direction, and impressed by the overall respect and tribute this film ultimately shows to our finest public servants. This is a film worth watching and owning. If you didn't appreciate firefighters before you saw this film, you certainly will after you see it.",1114473600,4,2117,4.5078125
2164057,4,B00063MAXQ,"Director Jay Russell has sculpted somewhat of a Frank Capra type tribute to the firefighter; the mostly unsung hero who isn't trying to be a hero, he (or she) is just doing the job they know and love.  Picture George Bailey running into a burning building in Bedford Falls; that's how I see Joaquin Phoenix in this film.  Quiet, stoic, family-oriented.  Devoted to a duty.

You won't mistake the plot for one crafted by M. Night Shamalan.  It's straightforward, softly dramatic, with no real plot twists, save for the will-he-or-won't-he finale.  What powers this film is the simple evolution of a young rookie into a seasoned firefighter; his relationships with his wife and kids as well as with his comrades.  There are the same very-close-to-cliche dilemmas between husband and wife associated with other ""he's got a dangerous profession"" films (see the astronauts in Apollo 13 or the test pilots in The Right Stuff, the flyboys in Pearl Harbor, the bomb defuser in The English Patient, and many more), but screenwriter Lew Colick never abuses those themes.  The film flows with the consistancy of main character Jack Morrison's (Phoenix's) life.  Day by day.

**SPOILER ALERT**  My only wish for this film was for the ending -- and skip forward a paragraph if you don't want any hint of what happens -- to have been different.  Sometimes, in such films, with such very high regard for the men and women of this profession, I wished for something I usually never wish for:  That Hollywood Ending.  **END OF SPOILER ALERT**

Joaquin Phoenix is becoming an actor whose work I look forward to viewing.  His work in ""The Village"" was very good.  He has a knack of playing the soft-spoken and, as I said earlier, stoic roles, and it suits him.  John Travolta plays the one-of-the-boys fire chief, protecting, fatherly, loving and stern all at once, and it was a nice part for him; a very strong supporting role.  I agree with what one of the other reviewers noted; that it is nice to see him in these supporting roles rather that directly in the spotlight.  His charisma is so present that he spices the atmosphere surrounding his fellow actors.

In short, Ladder 49 is a very nice popcorn drama for grown-ups.  It's not an edge-of-your-seat manly man flick, though it does have its action moments.  It is more of a fictional biography of one man and his ""two families.""  You might want to rent before you buy to see if it's one you'd add to your collection.",1114128000,6,2456,4.738207547169812

2164061,4,B00063MAXQ,"In the first half hour or so of Ladder 49 I wasn't sure if I was going to like the film because of it's rather formulaic presentation of it's sory.

It starts out with fireman Jack Morrison getting trapped inside a burning building and as he lays there trapped with fire all around him he looks back on his life which includes his rookie days as a fireman, meeting his wife, having kids, and losing comrades during firefighting battles. In between each segment of his life, it goes back to Jack trapped in the building while he waits for his company ladder 49 to try and rescue him.

Now what I really didn't like about the first part of this film was that it seemed like for one, it had a formulaic start, and just the basic parts of Jack's life like hanging out at the bar or the station, meeting girls at the grocery store and things like that seemed highly uninteresting. Now it's not that these things are bad or anything like that, it's just I had very little interest in watching these basic parts that happens in every man's life.

But as the story progressed and things got a little more dramatic, I started to see the bigger picture this film was trying to draw and I realized that this film is not only a simple tribute to firefighters, but it's a movie about life in general and how these simple, ordinary and common things are the moments that make a man's entire life and are what he is remembered by when he is gone.

So by the end credits of the movie I was feeling very emotional about what I had just watched and I was really glad I watched it.

Other than the storyline the film had some great performances from everyone in the movie and was well directed overall.",1113177600,3,1683,4.33015873015873
2164062,4,B00063MAXQ,"""Ladder 49"" is the kind of film that makes you want to bake up a whole lot of cookies, and take them to your local firehouse. The thing is, after watching ""Ladder 49,"" you realize that while the folks at your office would smile politely and say ""thanks,"" firefighters would probably take you on a tour of the firehouse, especially if your kids were with you, and would probably eat them with you as you walked.

That sort of quality is at the heart of ""Ladder 49,"" a fine film about the kind of people who sign up to be firefighters. There's a great, working-guy mentality to firefighters, who've seen it all, but don't become hard-bitten or bitter about it. There's a simple, genuine, wholesome quality to these people, and ""Ladder 49"" succeeds in helping us understand them.

The story centers around Jack (Joaquin Phoenix), who, as the film opens, is involved in fighting a nightmarish fire in a high-rise grain elevator. He aaves one trapped worker, but becomes trapped himself when the grain dust explodes. We then cut back to his first day as a rookie firefighter, and meet the guys at his firehouse, including his boss, Chief Kennedy (John Travolta), who's half-drunk and in shorts when we first meet him.

But Kennedy sees that Jack has a talent for firefighting, and the film follows Jack as he fights his first fire, falls in love, marries, and has kids, and begins to have second thoughts about his career path when his buddies begin to get killed and maimed on the job. But he sucks it up and goes back, out of duty to his firehouse as much to the citizens he serves.

Life in the firehouse seems to comprise mainly of long stretches with nothing to do, punctuated by emergency calls. During the lull times, the firefighters fill the time with relentless practical joking, pool, and good-natured ribbing. It's easy to see why firefighters stay on the job; who wouldn't love a job that consists mainly of hanging out with the guys, and helping people?

Jack's backstory is intercut with his ""present day"" crisis in the burning grain elevator, and his company's struggle to save him. These sequences are handled well (though not as well, it must be said, as in Ron Howard's ""Backdraft""), and we see that these firefighters are not just guys ""jumping into a burning building,"" but professionals with serious dedication to the mission.

Probably the greatest strength of ""Ladder 49"" is that it presents these firefighters as they are - not heroic, but just normal guys doing an incredibly difficult job with incredible heart. The film never lionizes its subjects, but rather paints their everyday existence with an almost detached respect.

If nothing else, this film - coupled with the recent memory of 9/11 - will make you incredibly grateful for those guys down the street, ready to leave their warm camraderie and practical joking behind at a moment's notice, and risk their lives to save us all.

What decent people these men (and women) are...and ""Ladder 49"" lets you get to know them with equal decency, respect, and gratitude. This is an outstanding film.",1113091200,3,3071,4.781132075471698
2164063,3,B00063MAXQ,"""Ladder 49"" is a tribute type of film- a movie that was created, supposedly, with the intent in mind to make you better appreciate the unselfish service of those who work in the firefighting departments all over the U.S. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta, this movie follows the life of a new recruit from his beginnings as a rookie, through his marriage and family life, all the way to a fatal fire at the end of the film.

I appreciate the fact that the director, Jay Russell, wanted everyone to see what a heroic job firefighters perform every day of their lives. The fire scenes in this film are real, and some of the scenes of the men going into blazing buildings are gripping. And so is the contribution of Joaquin Phoenix. It's interesting to watch the movie's main character, Phoenix's Jack Morrison, develop as the film progresses from a novice firefighter uncertain of himself to a family man trying to balance his personal life with his career.

If there is anything bad about this film, it would have to be that it doesn't really contain much originality or much of a story. It is full of clich&eacute;s and it basically presents a guy, his relationships with other firefighters, and his problems with his wife and family. There isn't much more to it than that, and it's the type of film that many will find ordinary and forgettable on its surface.

Joaquin Phoenix, John Travolta, and Robert Patrick are among the highlights of this film. They are effective in their roles and they perform well. The movie could use a little more drama in some parts, when the men are fighting fires. They get their job done, but they don't seem that emotional or intense, like you expect them to be.

This may not be the greatest Hollywood film of the past year, but it has enough positive qualities to earn it a recommendation. It has little originality, but it does succeed at its core mission: making the viewer more aware of the great sacrifices that firefighters make each day when the sirens sound.",1113091200,3,2010,4.653521126760563

2164065,2,B00063MAXQ,"Ladder 49 is movie about a bunch of guys who fight fires and drink beer and hang out together.  Juaquin (spelling?) Phoenix stars as a rookie firefighter who is welcomed to the group by the practical joking leader John Travolta.  Ladder 49 is at its best when it follows the group of fire fighters going from one hot spot to another and then celebrates or mourns afterwards.  The movie fails in its premise.

It opens in the present with the group fighting a raging fire in a large grain elevator.  Pheonix is on the 12th floor and right after saving someone, falls through a collapsing floor several stories onto a pile of rubble.  It is a miracle that he lives because that fall would kill anyone.  But he is still injured and trapped and his friends on the outside must try and save him.  While they try to save him, we are treated to flashbacks that follow Pheonix's life up to this point, including marriage and kids.

For the movie to succeed, the marriage and kids angle had to work because ultimately, they are the ones who will face the consequenses if their daddy and husband are killed in the fire.  However, his wife and kids don't even know he is in danger.  Whether or not Phoenix live or dies didn't really matter to me because he survived a 12 story fall that no mortal should have and only suffers an injured leg.

This movie has some good moments of firefighting and male bonding, but the emotional payoff the director was looking for just doesn't work.",1112918400,4,1471,4.488721804511278
2164066,5,B00063MAXQ,"I thought Ladder 49 did a convincing job displaying the every-day camraderie of things around the station--the joking and demented/dark humor is realistic. So is the crew hanging tight during after-hours get-togethers. I especially thought the flashback effect of Joaquin Phoenix's character of recalling memories and flashbacks throughout his career was realistic and a nescessary element of the film.

I became disabled due to my career as well & to this day the memories are ever-present as are the gritty & harrowing flashbacks of dying & death scenes & also life-saving calls.

Emergency services is like a family and everyone in the family takes on similar roles of that family as is displayed in Ladder 49. Of the emergency-type movies out there, this is most realistic to me; altho occ. they went for the cheap laugh such as the confession scenes seemed to stretch it too far. Although, we, too often went for the cheap joke/thrill in my companies as well.

The movie gives lay people a decent representation of life on this side of the coin. Being disabled from this sort of work and my having PTSD the movie did trigger some flashbacks, yet it was also worth the positive journey down memory lane for me.

Great film about life in the crewhouse, on calls, after-hours hanging out as families, and even down to shopping at the grocery store while on duty.",1112659200,3,1364,4.8412017167381975
2164067,1,B00063MAXQ,"This movie isn't even worthy of 1 star, it's complete sappy garbage. This film has no realistic or sensible characters AND NO PLOT what so ever. I'm convinced that a bunch of 16 year old girls got together and wrote the screenplay for this film... seriously, all this movie needed was a bunch of pretty ponies and a cameo by Ashley Simpson and Orlando Bloom. It's so played out!  The whole ""Save me Mr. Sexy Fireman and take me away to your magical floating castle in the sky"" fantasy is shat out in the form of this film for all those airhead teen girls and horny soccer mom's to flick off to. I'd rent something with Hilary Duff if I wanted to subject myself to that kind of mellowdramatic tripe. Yuck! I was seriously expecting to see these guys running around shirtless in the firestation lockeroom. Someone in editing probably came to their senses and cut that out thank God! What a shame for Joaquin Phoenix! This is definatley one movie that I would want to bump off my resume if I were him. We should expect better. If you have even half a brain, an once of dignity, or ANY decent cinematic taste, avoid this movie as if it were the plague.",1112572800,10,1148,4.389671361502347
2164068,4,B00063MAXQ,"This movie is more about firefighters than firefighting.  John Travolta (Captain Mike Kennedy) and Joaquin Phoenix (Jack Morrison) are excellent in their gritty roles, portraying very convincingly the terrible conditions and danger firefighters face on a regular basis.

Seeing Joaquin cast in a role that allows him to strut his stuff really warms my heart, and the touching storyline of his life and family values tugs at the tear ducts.  The one ""rear-facing"" body shot is somewhat disappointing after seeing Will Smith in I, Robot, but he still fills out a t-shirt rather nicely.

The story is told through flashbacks, a concept I am not really fond of, and some of the scenes drag on unnecessarily long without adding to the movie.  The point that Jack's crew is a closely knit bunch, and that the fate of each one affects them all, is repeated over and over, slowing the movie to a crawl in places.

Other than that, it is a terrific movie, driving home the fact that we are deeply indebted to the fire department for their courage and dedication.

After seeing this movie, you may get the urge to hug the next firefighter that crosses your path, but you should also remember the other brave people in the police force, the hospitals and the various emergency services, who willingly face danger to make our lives safer.

To all you wonderful people - Thank you for being there.

2164073,5,B00063MAXQ,"As a firefighter I was somewhat skeptical when a friend suggested we watch Ladder 49.  So often movies about firefighters are filled with Hollywood action and lack many factual and technical details.  As a result with movies such as Backdraft I tend to sit and count the number of factual mistakes rather then watch the plot unfold.  I was in for a surprise though as I quickly became engrossed in this film.  I laughed, cried and at times sat on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scenario.  This movie is great.  It shows all the different aspects of a firefighter's life.  The bonus footage including the collection titled ""Everyday Heroes"" just adds more to this great DVD.  I look forward to watching it again.  Even if that wasn't enough the soundtrack for this movie is also great.  I've already added it to my wishlist.",1111881600,2,833,4.605442176870748
2164074,5,B00063MAXQ,"In spite the fact that I'm from Baltimore and a major Joaquin Phoenix fan, Ladder 49 is an awesome film.  For one it doesn't have that Hollywood feel, but an everyday sort of quality.  Not the typical action packed adventure, but the telling of real life drama.  A story told in flashback Jack Morrison (Phoenix) is trapped and cut off from his fellow firefighters in a 20-story building inferno.  You become the onlooker of his initiation into the brotherhood of firefighters, his career decisions, his family life, and the struggles he faces watching his fellow firefighters suffering injury and death.

There is firemen bonding, rituals, rescues, pageantry, and everyday firehouse living.  You will laugh, hold your breath and cry.  My favorite scene occurs when Jack has to be lowered down the side of a high rise office building to rescue a trapped man.

The supporting cast which includes John Travolta as Cap. Mike Kennedy and Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison are vital to the story.  He gives the perspective of a fellow firemen and she the perspective of a concerned wife.

Once you view this film, you will have a whole new appreciation for what firefighters do everyday.  My cousin in a firemen and I didn't realize everything involved.  Also be sure to watch the Bonus Features to get even more insight.",1111795200,,1316,4.878378378378378

It was so moving, I actually still have wet cheeks from crying my eyes out (and smiling as I think about the funny parts).

If it were a Discovery Channel docudrama detailing the hands-on tactics of these fellows it would've been all right, but the nature of the fires is never explained (as it was in Backdraft, where the fire was an actual character... the villain).

The film brings you into the heart and soul of what it means to be a fire fighter--something that few of us probably really ever know about since it is always hard to walk in another man's shoes.  To watch this film is to appreciate what it means to have faith, to have a family, to have friends while at the same time risking your life because you have the skill and know-how to do a dangerous job.  The movie doesn't pull any punches in trying to bring to you, and me, the viewer the highs and lows, the ups and downs, the emotional sparks and drains of living a life of danger.  The film was intelligent, gritty, but tearful and makes you want to stand up and salute the brave souls who become fire fighters...police men and women ... and other noble professions that hardly get recognized under the high shine of movie stars and sports heroes.  I think I learned a lot today by watching this movie.  I learned that life is fleeting, just as the Bible tells us.  We are here today, gone tomorrow, dust in the wind.  So what do we do?  How do we act?  How do we perform?  And how, most of all, in the sight of God and in faith in God through Christ, do we leave behind a tale of endurance, of love, of heroism.",1111276800,3,1346,4.154440154440154
2164081,5,B00063MAXQ,"First and foremost, this is a drama, not an action film,  about firefighters, with the focus on one firefighter in particular. The film tells the story about the life this one firefighter, whose life is revealed in flashback, when he finds himself in a bit of difficulty while fighting a fire and engaging in a rescue. That singular moment in time is grounded in the context of his life as a firefighter.  While the film may be said to be somewhat formulaic and predictable, it does not take away from the fine acting, the great fire fighting sequences, and the poignant and funny moments that occur throughout the film. In many ways it is reflective of life itself, with some highs and lows, as well as a ready, steady core of reality in which all is grounded.

The firefighter who finds himself in a quandary is Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix), a firefighter at a Baltimore firehouse. The viewer sees Jack in his rookie days as he is initiated into the brotherhood of firefighters and begins the bonding process with his fellow firefighters, whereby they become ""family"". Some of those bonding scenes are quite funny, especially the one involving his initial  meeting with the then Captain of the firehouse, Mike Kennedy (John Travolta).  Others are quite serious and poignant, as the dangers of the job are brought home to the viewer, especially when Jack  loses a  member of the brotherhood that is near and dear to him. The film shows, as the years go by,  Jack's progression through the ranks from rookie to respected firefighter. It is clear that it is a job that he loves, despite the ever present danger to life.

As the viewer sees Jack's professional life unfold,  the viewer also catches glimpses into Jack's personal life, from the moment that he meets his future wife, Linda (Jacinda Barrett), to the moment of their wedding and the birth of their children, with the wife and children also becoming part of the larger firefighter family or brotherhood. The film also shows the tremendous pressure and stress that a firefighter's job can have on one's spouse and children with their ever present concern for the safety of that beloved firefighter. After all, firefighters go where others dare not, simply so that others may live. The film shows how firefighters and members of their  families cope with this ever present sword of Damocles that hangs over their respective heads.

Joaquin Phoenix, who is one of the finest young actors of his generation, gives a low key, but poignant, performance as the salt of the earth kind of guy who wants to do the best that he can for those whom he loves, in a job that he loves, with those with whom he loves working. He gives a quintessential portrayal of a working class guy for whom firefighting and family are concepts at the central core of his being.  John Travolta gives a humorous and, at times, affecting performance as Mike Kennedy, the firefighting official who clearly is not above playing a practical joke on his firefighters but who pulls out all the stops to ensure that none are left behind when fighting a fire. Jacinda Barrett is effective in the role of  Linda, the concerned wife who does her best to allay her fears and, over time, become supportive of her husband's chosen career. The rest of the supporting cast is equally effective in their respective roles.

This is a film that those who would like to sneak a peek into the life of a firefighter will appreciate. It will certainly let the viewer see the everyday types of situations that may confront a firefighter, as well as enable the viewer to discern  why firefighters form such close relationships with each other. After viewing this film, a viewer can certainly walk away with an understanding as to why firefighters are such  a unique brotherhood and why they bond as they do. It takes a special person, indeed, to walk into a towering inferno. This film does firefighters proud, and my hat is certainly off to  firefighters everywhere. It is with good reason that we, in The Big Apple, call our firefighters New York's bravest.",1111276800,59,4066,4.751420454545454

All in all is structured well but the movie is so bland and heavy handed i hardly cared. the acting was ok. Joaquin pheonix is decent as the protagonist, but John Travolta didn't do it for me thanks to the fact he has changed much. the movie seems painfully rote with his firefighting days from rookie to hero and his marriage from happy to crumbling seems lifted right out of backdraft and it seems padded through with cliche's.those elements alone drain the movie of any drama.

For those of you comparing this to Backdraft,please don't. Backdraft is an unrealistic(Lot's of saftey flaws that firemen would NEVER do!!! But it was good)Action Movie with a little drama. Ladder 49 is a very realistic Drama with some action.

This movie appears to have been very well researched. We found no faults in how the rescues were performed, they followed protcall. There was only one scene where Jack was separated from his partner while rescuing a little girl. This should not have happened. Firemen are trained to stay with there partner during a search and rescue but I guess realisticlly, people may not always follow protocall and things like this would happen.

For people who are complaining about the drinking and pranks involved in the movie. That's life, people do those things. Please remember that firemen work 24hr shifts and do unwind afterwards. Also, the pranks are normal. I see guys I work with pulling pranks on each other all of the time and I work in an office with educated people. The pranks are not always polically correct. Get over it, people do pranks.

Oh yes, the things done with the firetruck such as a Wedding and other things are done. I have seen it in my own town. Firemen across the country do this. For those of you worrying about your taxes paying for this, please remember that firemen are underpaid for what they do. And it's not everday somebody gets marrried.

The sets are very realistic, the acting is extremely convincing, and the story is, in a sense, something for everyone (marriage, having children, choosing a career), in this well-written and fantastically produced movie.  I have seen a few bad fires in my life, even doused a few...this movie is as realistic as it gets.

  Joaquin Phoenix, playing rookie firefighter Jack Morrison, occasionally gives us that ""frozen face - semi-stupid"" look that Tobey Maguire has made a career of, but unlike Maguire, Phoenix is a very solid actor.  After the first ten minutes Phoenix had me believing he was actually learning the ropes as a firefighter.  He is extremely convincing in his role, as are the rest of the actors and actresses in this great movie.

  Ladder 49 offers some great scenes, memorable dialogue, and a cast of great characters.  The flashback scenes do not confuse the viewer.  In fact, I enjoyed the flashback scenes and the way they were used to show us the life of Jack Morrison.  By the end of the film, I found myself wishing to know even more about how this man lived his life.

  I really can't say enough good things about this film.  It has action, drama, suspense, and pulls just about every emotion out of the viewer.  I highly recommend this film.  I even consider it a must-see!

2164085,2,B00063MAXQ,"I will begin by saying that my review in no way reflects on the brave and selfless nature of the people who fight fires.  They are truly heroes and deserve our utmost respect and appreciation.  In fact, those people deserved a better film.

Ladder 49 is a movie filled with lofty intentions and themes.  Among them are courageousness, heroism, comeraderie in the face of danger, family values, and self sacrifice.  Of course none of these themes are very original, but that doesn't mean the film couldn't still be a winner.  Unfortunately the overfamiliar themes are executed in such a grossly derivitive/cliched manner by the screenplay writer, director, score writer and editor that the film ultimately succumbs under the weight of them.  The film is so loaded with cliches in fact, that halfway through it one might conclude that it could have been made more cheaply and effectively simply by splicing together scenes from other films.  And maybe it was just the writing, but I was both surprised and disappointed to find Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta's performances to be exceedingly uninspired and stock.

The story begins and revolves around the life of Jack (Phoenix), a gung-ho young man who fulfills his dream to become a firefighter in the city of Baltimore.  Be warned.  His story is told in a series of poorly paced flashback scenes that jump from the past 10 years of events in his life, then back to a burning building in which he is presently trapped.  Each flashback installment represents a different cliche that has been done better in various other films.

The first flashback depicts the ""let's play a practical joke on the new guy."" routine right out of the gate.  Wow, never seen that before!  Soon thereafter Jack predictably becomes the ""mascot"" and favorite in the department.  He also comes to represent a son of sorts to the one dimesnional Chief played by Travolta.  This relationship is never cultivated by any particular events in the film.  The viewer is simply expected to accept that since Jack's is the main character, that he also is the Chief's favorite.  As such their whole relationship seems phony, as do Travolta's ridculous gray painted sideburns.

Later we learn that being an alcoholic Catholic is apparently a prerequisite to work at this Baltimore station. Ladder 49 plays that offensive and tired stereotype to the hilt.  This crew apparently spends 50% of their time at the station and the other 50% at the bar.

A flashback or two later Jack naturally meets his ""special girl"" in a supermarket (where else?).  It is apparent from the start of this scene that there is absolutely no chemistry between Phoenix and his leading lady.  This is one of the largest failures in Ladder 49.  Later in the film these two have the inevitable ""It's hard to be married to a firefighter, cop, soldier."" issues.  These scenes play more like bad soap opera than high budget production.

As Ladder 49 drones on, we predictably see a buddy or two get seriously injured or killed.  (Here's where the cliches really get going.)  After a member of the crew is killed in a fire, we see the crew back at the station.  Words are exchanged and before you know it, a few members of the crew get into the grief/anger induced fisticuffs with each other.  Right on cue, the Chief played by Travolta dashes in to stop the fracas and give his ""fallen brother"" speech to set the crew straight.

Even the music editing is bad.  There isn't a scene in Ladder 49 that tries to stand on its own merit.  The music in the film all but hits you over head in trying to tell you what you're supposed to be feeling at any given moment.  I could go on and on about how this film is a series of manipulative cliches, but by now I'm sure you get the point.  Suffice it to say that if you've seen a couple of war, sports, and cop movies in your lifetime, then Ladder 49 has very little to offer you.

The only thing I can say that is positive about the film is that the audio production on the DVD is quite good.  So if you're looking for a DVD to show off your subwoofer, this is a good choice.",1110931200,5,4100,4.619640387275242

2164087,4,B00063MAXQ,"This is not your typical, feel-good, happy-sappy Hollywood movie-mill production, and for that I was grateful. If you're a fan of that type of film, I encourage you to expand your horizons before venturing into Ladder 49. This is the kind of movie that leaves you feeling sober, pensive, somber, and maybe even a little more grateful for those willing to risk their lives so we can sleep better at night.

It's not a perfect production, and at the heart of the flaws is Mr. Travolta who delivers an almost flat and empty performance. I say ""almost"" because in the last five minutes of the film his character Captain Mike Kennedy finally comes to life and turns believable. During the rest of the film it's just too obvious that we're watching an actor try to fit into a role which he has not fully assimilated and doesn't know how to play.

Counter that with the performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who is quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. He first appeared on my radar screen for his role as Commodus in Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" where he was so positively gross and horrible that it took some time for me to realize that Phoenix was only acting. Add to that his roles in M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" and you have one of the most talented and diverse actors alive today.

In Ladder 49 he plays firefighter Jack Morrison, and we watch his career progress through a series of flashbacks which take place as he is trapped in a burning grain elevator in Boston harbor. Phoenix takes a comfortable and casual approach to the role and perfectly pulls off being an ordinary guy torn between his family and his career. It's a common situation in Hollywood movies, but Phoenix is remarkable believable.

There are a few scenes the film could have done without, mostly because they felt too obvious and cheap.

Example 1: After the death of a fellow firefighter the crew is sitting back at the firehouse. An old veteran comments that his death was avoidable and that he made an obvious mistake. Morrison (Phoenix) erupts at the slander of his dead friend and a fight breaks out, but is quickly broken up by Captain Kennedy (Trivolta) who, surprise, yells and screams and belittles them both for behaving such a way in ""my house.""

Example 2: Shortly after Morrison falls in love with Linda (Jacinda Barrett) the two are in a bar with the rest of the fire house crew, everyone becoming progressively drunk, and of course they play the usual drinking games of who can down more booze then the other.

Both scenes, and several others like them, are clear attempts to show normal human nature, but are so obvious, expected, and over used that they make much of the film feel cookie-cutter and stereotyped. Couple that with a lazy performance by Trivolta, and it adds up to a not-so-wonderful job by director Jay Russell. It's a good thing he had Phoenix and an overall inspiring subject, which more then compensate and turn the movie into a solid four stars.

In a nutshell, Ladder 49 ia a film everyone should see. It's not a ""jump up and down and shout"" type movie, it's a ""wow, that was real"" type movie. You'll be glad you watched it.",1110844800,,3153,4.617857142857143

For all of you dumbasses who gave this movie a bad review cause you don't like John Travolta you don't need to write reviews anymore.  Yeah I don't like some actors either but you can't rate a movie bad just because you don't like someone.  This movie is not about one actor its about firefighters and seeing what they actually do.  Rate movies because of the quality of movie.  John Travolta's acting wasn't so terrible that the movie was a waste of time.  It has amazing special effects and you are brought into every fire the movie has.  The acting was not bad at all and I give it a four stars because overall this movie came together and made out for a surperb ending. Yeah its sad but its life and this is what real firefighters go through.  My dad is a firefighter and though he isn't running into 50 story buildings he has still been inside a burning building and helped people.  Maybe this is what made me open up and enjoy the movie and be touched by it so much.  Maybe some of you need to loose firefighter friends to open your eyes up and see there is more to a movie than one actor.  And don't go watch it if you don't like John Travolta so people don't have to hear your crap about him.  For all of you who gave this a bad rating you need to open up and realize that just cause you don't like an actor doens't meen a movie is bad.  Look at the movie as a whole.

As we still all take them sort of for granted and just how dangerous their jobs really are.  Joaquin Phoenix was great as a firefighter who's trapped with no hope of really being resuced, who looks over his life as a firefighter from the first day he arrived up to the point where he's at current in that blazing inferno which is about to blow at any minute.  The movie really focused more on the comraderie of the firefighters, which was a good thing considering that they seem to spend more time with each other than their own families, and in essence, are all each other have during the dangerous calls they must respond to regularly.  John Travolta was his usual self as the fire chief.  He was witty, funny, and emotionally powerful.  Robert Patrick and Morris Chestnut were also very good.  The movie also focused on the strain being a firefighter puts on their families as well.  The DVD extras was also great.  There are even extras that interview actual Baltimore firefighters and you can see the love they have for they do cuz the money as usual is just not enough for what they do to protect us.

The filmmakers and actors managed to capture the camaderie of emergency workers who stay with each other in the same building for hours on end.  Even to the point of going to the local pub after the shift is over for a pint; that is the mark of a true _team_ and a good one.

While it was predictable, the filmmakers managed to keep it all from being boring, with fires at random times, and personal problems being few and far between--but true for the lives of people who put their lives on the line daily.

the effects where underdone to say the least.phoneix was more like a hulking mongoloid child in this film, with his mouth hanging open and his lurching over stuffed walk ,then a proud member of an elite group of men and women who pride themselves on there mental accutity and physical prowess.

they would of done much better demonstrating firefighters  technical skills,and the real effects of heat, smoke and life and death battles that mark fire fighters as the best friends you'll probaly never know...if your lucky.

the only saving graces were john travolta who plays a commander  calm in a crisis.which means he probaly did his homework,with some real fire man.the other is to demonstrate how terriably under paid these men and women really are and to maybe start asking our wonderfully overpaid city officals why this is so.",1110585600,5,1145,4.968586387434555
2164092,4,B00063MAXQ,"""Ladder 49"" is a drama about the lives and work of firefighters that will appeal to admirers of firefighters and fans of movies about fire. The fires in the film are not CGI. They are real, and the actors were really very close to the flames. External shots of fires were filmed in Baltimore, where the movie takes place. The city allowed filmmakers to set fire to a number of buildings, including a very big fire, complete with explosions, in the abandoned grain elevator in which the main character is trapped.

Firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) is trapped inside a burning building when the floor collapses beneath him. As he waits for help from his colleagues, he drifts in and out of consciousness, remembering his life a firefighter from his first day as a rookie  with Engine 33. Jack's story is told in flashback. He recalls what made him love his job as a ""pipe man"" before transferring to Search & Rescue, how he met his wife (Jacinda Barrett), his relationship with his mentor Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta), and the effects of a dangerous job on himself and his family.

Although ""Ladder 49"" has five fire episodes, including the spectacular fire at the grain elevator, the movie is very low-key. It's about the day-to-day lives of firefighters. The film spends a lot of time in a bar that the men frequent, at a wedding reception, a child's birthday party, and observing the firefighters' practical joking. These mundane scenes are punctuated by tragedy, when a firefighter is killed or injured on the job. The fault I find with the film is that the mundane scenes are too many. I realize that director Jay Russell is trying to contrast the ordinariness of the men's lives with the extraordinary dangers they face. But everyday life really is dull, and it makes the film longer than it should be. The central relationships -between Jack and Mike, Jack and his wife, and the group of firefighters- provide a cohesive narrative and thematic thread. Periodically returning to the grain warehouse fire keeps us interested in Jack's story and gives the film unified structure. ""Ladder 49"" is a great film for firefighters and fires, but don't expect excitement.

The DVD: Bonus features include some making-of documentaries, a documentary about real Baltimore city firefighters, 5 deleted scenes, an audio commentary by director Jay Russell and editor Bud Smith, and a music video for ""Share Your Light"" by Robbie Robertson. ""The Making of Ladder 49"" (21 minutes) is a documentary in 3 parts, which may be viewed separately. The first part, ""On Location"" (5 1/2 minutes), includes interviews with the director, producers, actors, and writer Lewis Colick, in which they discuss choosing Baltimore as the location and the work of the actors. In the second part, ""The Academy: Training the Actors"" (7  minutes), the actors who played firefighters talk about their experiences training at Baltimore's Fire Academy. Their instructor, Lt. Mark Yant, is also interviewed. The third part, ""Anatomy of a Scene: The Warehouse Fire"" (8 1/2 minutes), discusses the technical challenges of creating and shooting the warehouse fire in a real building and of adding the sound later. ""Everyday Heroes"" (13 minutes) interviews a lot of Baltimore firemen and their families, who talk about why they became firefighters and the camaraderie among their colleagues. The audio commentary mostly addresses the technical aspects of creating and filming real fires with actors and crew in the middle of them, as well as sound effects and audio tracks that were all added in post-production. There is some discussion of firefighters, but this is largely like an expanded version of the ""Anatomy of a Scene"" documentary. Captioning in English is available for the movie. Subtitles are available in French and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.",1110499200,7,3846,5.050393700787402

2164094,3,B00063MAXQ,"LADDER 49 is a story searching for a script.  Though filled (literally almost every frame) with some of the best pyrotechnics material that has been filmed, the story is an obvious one that seems it wants to pay tribute to the firemen who protect us - a very worthy intent.

The problem with this film is the flatness of the characters.  We know no more about the characters in the story at the end of the film than we do at the beginning, and the beginning is the end of this flimsy script!  One wonders why the producers hired fine actors like Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta and then seemed to have said 'make it up on your own' instead of supplying a well thought through storyline.  Phoenix and Travolta give it their very best as do all the other actors in the movie.  But without having some information about these people - childhood experiences, why they chose firefighting, conflicts, dreams, etc - it is difficult to become truly involved in what eventually becomes a sappy tearjerker.

But if you're into death-defying burning building action and close calls, then grab a big tub of popcorn because this film is sure to please you!  Grady Harp, March 05",1110412800,,1167,4.603864734299517
2164095,5,B00063MAXQ,"LADDER 49 is a movie that one can't help but appreciate for the vivid and accurate portrayal of those men and women who rush into burning buildings while the other people are rushing out.  Joaquin Phoenix in one of his best performances plays firefighter Jack Morrison who we first meet trapped in a pyrotechnical nightmare.  Via flashbacks, we trace Jack through his first day on the job through his current predicament.  Phoenix gives Jack a heroic foundation but also shows us his own doubts, his love for his job and his family.  John Travolta pulls his weight in a subtler performance as the fire chief, Mike Kennedy, who shows a real love for his firefighters and a sense of humor to boot.  Jacinda Barrett does a credible job as Morrison's wife, Linda, who professes the expected worry over Jack's dangerous profession, but also lets him know how proud she is of him, and she's behind him all the way.  Baltazar Getty, Robert Patrick, Tim Guinee, Billy Burke and Morris Chesnut are especially good in their supporting roles.  The special effects are seamless and some of the best since BACKDRAFT.  Director Jay Russell focuses on the character's heroics and although the end is predictable, it still packs a wallop.  ""Shine Your Light"" by Robbie Robertson is a lovely song and was sadly overlooked in this year's crummy Oscar nominations.

Joaquin Phoenix plays Jack Morrison, a firefighter who finds himself trapped inside a burning building. As he waits for his rescuers to arrive, Jack reflects back on his career and family, flashing back to his days as a rookie and his relationship with his wife Linda (Jacinda Barrett).

The reason this movie is so good is because it has so much to offer: amazing action sequences and special effects (some of the best fire scenes ever are in this film), humor (John Travolta's flowered boxer shorts), human drama (the reality of the dangers involved in being a firefighter), friendship, and a love story. I guess you could say that the story is a little predictable, but I can almost guarantee that you'll be surprised by the way the movie ends.

2164099,4,B00063MAXQ,"Joaquin Phoenix was on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly"" in character for ""The Village"" in a successfully bait and switch for us to think that he was the hero in M. Night Shyamalan's last film.  Instead, it was Bryce Dallas Howard who was the heart and soul of that film and who should have been on the cover if something other that the publicity game was calling the shots.  I mention this because Phoenix should have been on the cover for his role in ""Ladder 49"" in which he is the soul of the film, with John Travolta being the heart (yes, Phoenix's character finds a wife, but the point is that the man is wedded to his job), although he will probably be on a cover or two when his role as Johnny Cash in ""I Walk the Line"" hits the big screen.

The cinematic predecessor of Jay Russell's ""Ladder 49"" is Ron Howard's ""Backdraft,""and the common denominators in both films are the use of real fire rather than CGI and the emphasis on the dedication of the men who fight fires.  But ""Backdraft"" was a murder/arson mystery and ""Ladder 49"" is made in the wake of 9/11.  The big line of the film is when Travolta's character says, ""People are always asking me how is it that firefighters run into a burning building when everyone else is running out. Courage is the answer.""  It is a good line and certainly rings true, but I have to believe that everybody who hears it thinks not of the characters they have seen in this movie but those who ran into the World Trade Center and never came back out.

The best thing about ""Ladder 49"" is that it puts faces on not only those firefighters who died on 9/11 but on the equally faceless public servants who work in Baltimore or any other major city (we are not quite in that league in terms of having the quantity and quality of fire calls depicted in the film, which is a good thing).  The story begins at the end and a massive fire in a Baltimore grain warehouse in which Jack Morrison (Phoenix) completes a rescue and then comes trapped in the burning building when the grain dust explodes.  We then go back to the first day the rookie firefighter walked into a firehouse and the hazing began as soon as he was through the door.  Captain Mike Kennedy (Travolta) is a third generation firefighter and a consummate professional.  There is a nice sequence at Jack's first fire where the rookie is working the ""pipe"" (he is the guy on the nozzle of the fire house spraying the water on the fire), and Kennedy is right behind him talking him through the job and teaching how it should be done.

The film goes back and worth between the attempts to rescue Jack and his career as a firefighter, with the latter being entwined with his meeting, romancing, and marrying Linda (Jacinda Barrett).  The job is a mixture of triumph and tragedy, and there is a sense in which the climax of the film becomes not Jack's rescue but the point where he has the choice between moving from the engine to the ladder (search & rescue) or taking a desk job by going with Kennedy when he becomes a chief.  Obviously we know the decision he is going to make and chose the work over safety, but what is important is that we understand his decision and we appreciate the sacrifice.

Another strength of the script by Lewis Colick is that it fleshes out the cast of supporting characters as well.  Not because they are a group of loveable eccentrics, but rather because they seem like a real group of guys.  Of course the actors went through a two-week course in firefighting, so authenticity is not a problem.  As for the ending, my only comment is that I thought the decision was obvious a lot earlier than that, but one of the points about ""Ladder 49"" is that the obvious decision to us so clearly goes against the grain for these men.",1110326400,6,3755,4.409551374819102

Granted, I am no Baltimore city fireman, nor am I a paid full-time fireman.

This film places the emphasis on why these men party as hard as they do - because every beer might be the last one, and it might as well be the best one.",1110240000,22,818,4.326797385620915
2164104,5,B00063MAXQ,"Of the three major motion pictures that have focused on the heroics of firefighters (""Towering Inferno"", 1974, ""Backdraft"", 1991, ""Ladder 49"", 2004) LADDER 49 is without a doubt the most realistic and heartfelt tribute to the professional & personal lives of firefighters.

While some people (especially men who aren't in touch with their own emotions) may find much of the film ""mushy"", Ladder 49 shows what a REAL MAN is all about - an unselfish devotion to both his community and his wife & children.

Following 10 years of his life, from rookie firefighter to a hardened veteran ""rescue man"", as well as his courtship, marriage and birth of his children, we see the main role - Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a man who loves helping others in a time of need, and as a loving, devoted husband and father.

The fire scenes are the most realistic I've seen, and also help to show the bravery, dedication and compassion that Jack has for both strangers and his fellow firefighters.

Jack Morrison is the type of man most women would want to marry & raise a family with. And he is the type of man other men SHOULD want to be...dedicated to helping others and being a loving & devoted husband and father...not being obssesed with money and materialistic items!

Adam Kennedy (John Travolta), first as Jack's firehouse Captain, then later as his Battalion Chief, is also excellent as Jack's mentor, friend and his children's Godfather.

Jack's wife (played by the stunningly beautiful Jacinda Barrett) is a fun-loving, playful, yet sweet, romantic and very loving wife and mother who is worried about the highly dangerous rescue work Jack performs.

The supporting cast of firefighter comrades is excellent. You can see that the ""guys"" are like a family, and are willing to sacrifice their lives for each other.

""Ladder 49"" is a ""feel good"" movie that will have you laughing, crying at times (maybe even some of you ""macho"" men!), watching with awe and amazement, and fill you with a sense of great respect for firefighters...all at the same time.

Due to some (bloodless) scenes of death and disfigurment, the film may not be suitable for younger children. But for you parents, if you think your children can deal with these scenes, Ladder 49 is a movie that can make a wonderful & lasting impression on them.

2164108,3,B00063MAXQ,"Kudos go to the cast of this film, especially Joaquin Phoenix as firefighter Jack Morrison and Jacinda Barrett as his wife Linda. The cutting is great, the action tight, but the plot rudimentary. This is NOT a fire thriller in the mode of Backdraft. It profiles the life and career of a rooky foreman. He joins the department, gets married and has children, and grows in firefighting skill and devotion. His biological family and his family of firefighters are both exemplary. But the movie is not a gripping thriller. There is no villain; everybody is a good guy, as it were.

That is perhaps the major problem of the film. It is great to have someone to hate (witness the video game tester in the live action ""101 dalmations""). In this film, you or course hate and fear FIRE. But the characters are normal humans--they act and interract, are sometimes loving and sometimes petty, they are goofy, the do well or not so well, etc. The effects are pretty good. But the final big tragic fire is perhaps a trifle contrived. The doom is too inevitable. You could predict what will happen at the end of the film from just about the first scene.

The film is good in showing the give-and-take in the normal life of a fire station crew. There are good funny moments, and good melancholy moments. The characters are well established. Also, the film does give homage to the worthiness of fire fighters.

But the film fails as gripping or stirring entertainment.",1110153600,,1452,4.6640625
2164109,2,B00063MAXQ,"Let me start off by saying that, although I had a feeling that

the movie would be the way it was, I was simply hoping for a

little more than what ""Backdraft"" gave. I am a ""Fire Buff"" first

off, and for those whom don't know what that is I'm interested

in the Operations and equipment of our nations Fire Departments.

I was hoping that their would be more Actual Fire Fighting

scenes, especially in the way of offensive way[from the outside

when they know they can't ""knock"" the fire from the inside. You

would think that, after ""9/11"" that their would be more of an

interest in this aspect of the Firefighting profession, not

just in the ""Hero"" type stuff. It would have been nice in a

""just for the sake of it""[for the public's knowledge] if they

took some time to explain a little about fire fighting and of

course to explain that a Fire ""Truck"" and and a Fire ""Engine""

are not the same thing, which they are not!, use the opportunity

of making this movie to teach the viewer something!. I think that

they could have done away with all the Cliche ""Probie"", that's

probationary firefighter stuff, the little ""hazing stuff"". I

think it would have been good if they didn't[for once] have to

have the main firefighter character have a wife and family[like

John Travolta's character, for what they showed at least. I think

it would have been interesting to show that most of the time that

firefighters respond Daily to calls of wrongly activated fire

alarms and following ambulances along to help a Person stuck in

their bath tub, more real-life stuff, not every call puts a fire

fighter in place where He or She has the opportunity to become

a ""Hero"".

Overall if You liked the more Typical ""Drama"" of Backdraft and

the ""Towering Inferno"", you'll like this film, not that those

movies weren't okay, they were overall good as well. This is a

good ""popcorn"" movie, but probably[at least overall] not for

those with an interest in the fire service.",1109894400,2,1973,4.583333333333333

2164111,2,B00063MAXQ,"This film is a color-by-numbers look at a Baltimore firehouse.  It is meant as a tribute to firefighters in the wake of 9/11 that will tug on the heartstrings of Americans who were touched by the efforts of the NYFD.

The characters in this film all seem to have come from some generic scriptwriting textbook.  It doesn't help that many of the performances were mailed in either.  I can't say the acting was necessarily bad, it just wasn't anything special.  One notable exception, and pleasant surprise was the performance by former Real World London cast member, Jacinda.  She was the only actor in this movie that was able to breathe life into her character.  Sadly, her screen time was limited.  Meanwhile, Travolta and Phoenix seemed to be sleepwalking through their performances in spite of the fact that they both no doubt put everything they had into it.

This is a film that wanted to make you cry and feel and gain a deep appreciation for firefighters.  Well, one would be hard-pressed to find an American who doesn't already have a deep and profound respect and admiration and appreciation for them.  Regardless, Ladder 49 misses its mark.  Perhaps it tried too hard.  In the end, I was more bored than anything, and I felt nothing for anyone.

On a technical level, making movies with or about fire is really difficult and in that respect they did a decent job.  The fire looks hot.  Unfortunately, this isn't a special effects action film, it's a slice of life human drama.

I didn't go into this expecting some big action movie or Backdraft 2 - I was well aware this was going to be a drama.  It wasn't really a bad movie, but it was also anything but good.  I gave it a 2/5 because it just misses every goal it set, but at the same time it wasn't a terrible film.  Some people will likely enjoy this movie and I'm sure there are people out there who will get emotional over it.  However, if someone does get emotional over it, I'd bet it was because they were drawing from personal ties to 9/11 or to a firefighter or some such thing rather than because the movie did what it was trying to do.

As for the DVD... the transfer is decent and the 5.1 audio mix is good.  The video was clean with no artifacts that I could see, but it didn't blow me away... I think there's a little room for improvement.  DTS sound wouldn't hurt either.  Perhaps they'll release a superbit or something someday.  As it stands though, this DVD is more than good enough given the quality of the movie.  The menus are also pretty generic and boring - no surprise there.

The extras include a 13 minute documentary about firefighters which includes interviews with cast members as well as actual firefighters.  It's basically more melodrama and pretty boring.  There's some making-of features here as well that is pretty interesting if you like to know about how they did the effects and how the actors trained for the fire scenes.

There are also some equally dull deleted scenes (about 14 minutes worth) that look like they were pulled from a 4th generation vhs copy.  Audio commentary is also included by director and editor... I didn't listen to it because I didn't want to sit through the film again.

Finally there's a music video for the boring and generic song ""shine your light"" by Robbie Robertson (even his name is generic).  It's just scenes from the film mixed with Robbie singing in various locations with Jacinda in a few of them.  Nothing remarkable about it.

Is this worth purchasing?  Well, it's a good DVD for those who like the film enough.  If you haven't seen the film, I'd urge you to rent it first.  It's not something I'd ever need or want to see again.  If you're a big huge fan of firefighters, this item does milk the firefighter tribute thing quite a bit.  I would recommend you all check out Towering Inferno instead though because my uncle was in it as a stuntman and so was The Juice (before he allegedly murdered his wife).",1109894400,4,3948,4.551136363636363
2164112,2,B00063MAXQ,"I had some pretty low expectations going in to see Ladder 49, and the movie still managed to disappoint me. Ladder 49 managed to earn 2 stars, one of them for the excellent fire effects, and the other... well, I can't tell you about the other.

Joaquin Phoenix is Jack Morrison, firefighter extraordinaire! The movie starts off with the burning building we've all seen in the previews, and Jack is running around inside trying to save people. In short order he finds himself separated from his buddies and wondering if he'll make it out alive. But wait! We're only 10 minutes into the movie, sounds like a good time for a flashback! That's right, this story is told via the tried-n-true ""look at me in trouble and see what happened earlier in my life to get me here"" method.

I hate flashback movies.

The other big name in this film is John Travolta who plays Captain Mike , and who does a damn fine job of it. Then, when does Travolta not do a damn fine job? Honestly, the acting in this movie is top notch with all of the actors turning in great performances. Whether they're goofing off at the station or running through a burning building, we totally buy into their characters.

The real star of this movie though is the fire as this movie has the best fire-effects I've ever seen. If you want to see a big fire, forget the rating on this movie and just go see it, you won't be disappointed. It's the non-fire scenes that I have a problem with.

This is not an action movie, this is a drama, and I'm ok with that. What I'm not ok with is how freakin predictable everything was. We get to see Jack on his first day as a rookie... Jack on his first fire... Jack meets a girl... Jack loses a friend... Jack has a career crises... Jack get to be a hero... blah blah blah. There are no real surprises here, as soon as you realize the movie is all a flashback you already know the main characters are never in any real danger and you're just waiting to get back to real-time. Quite annoying.

If you're really into firefighters then by all means, go see this one on the big screen. If you're into a mushy plot, then go for it! If you've just GOT to see the big fire and that's the only reason you want to see the movie... then I'll point out again that you see the fire in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Think about that information and do with it what you will.

Ladder 49 is one of the best 2 star movies I've seen, but it's still only 2 stars.

2164113,3,B00063MAXQ,"I'm probably going to be the odd person out, but I didn't care too much for this movie.  Don't get me wrong, the visual effects were great and the respect shown for the dangers and sacrafices firefighters make for the public are clearly relayed in this film.  However, there wasn't much of a plot to the film; about twenty minutes into the movie I was still wondering why I was still watching it.  There wasn't much a climax to the script and most of the movie was very predictable and FULL of cliches. Also, the film lacked a lot of character development.  I'm the type of viewer who like to know a characters background to really feel for the character, and that was overlooked for many of the characters in this film.  I wanted to know more about the other firefighters in the station who were also a part of the ""family"".  Also, the romance between Pheonix's character and that of Barretts seemed rushed and flat.  There was definitly room for growth and elaboration for that relationship.

Now, acting wise, Juaquin Pheonix did give a great performance throughout the film, but however I felt that Travolta was either underacting in some scenes, or overacting in others.  Also, newcomer Jacinda Barrett wasn't a very strong actor in this film as well.  It just seemed as though many scenes demanded more than she was able to give, or maybe I just can't get over that she is Jacinda from The Real World - London.

This film had so much potential had the casting been done differently and there had been a stronger script and character development.  The special effects where great and were the only reason the film managed to keep my interest until the end.

The DVD has many many Special Features worth checking out, and there is a great ""Everday Heroes"" feature in which real firefighters share their own stories that is truly worth checking out.

Also, the soundtrack to the film is worth 5/5 stars.  Just the right songs were chosen for the right scenes, and all were new songs to myself, and not the Top 40 stuff that's been overplayed in movies.",1109808000,,2055,4.607142857142857

While many critics slammed Ladder 49 upon its theatrical release it manages to defy those critics in being entertaining anyway.  Sure, it may not be as good as Backdraft was a decade ago, but when viewed on its own merits Ladder 49 manages to both pull at the heartstrings and thrill you.  The firefighting scenes are well done, and the acting is generally good.  Joaquin Phoenix carries off his part fairly well, as does John Travolta.  Robert Patrick is particularly strong in a good supporting role.  The movie can move into soap opera territory at times, but never so much as to really take away from the movie.  Ladder 49 ultimately proves to be a movie that entertains a general audience even if the critics didn't like it.  Then again, the critics often dislike what most moviegoers like.  I gave Ladder 49 3 1/2 stars, and my wife gave it 4 1/2 stars - leading to a rather solid 4 star rating.",1109721600,3,1017,4.574585635359116

John Travolta does a wonderful job as the chief. And Joaquin Phoenix is cast as the young fireman, our protagonist. Jacinda Barrett play's his lovely young fireman's wife.

The film starts with an action packed fire where our hero gets trapped within the burning building. It is from here that we see his ten years career through flashbacks. We see the relationships and bonds between the firefighters and their families. Like anyone else, they fall in love and have families. But of course unlike most families, every time the firefighter goes to work, we never know if he will return home. Like any high pressure and dangerous job, there is a lot of camaraderie and good-natured fun among the men. And of course a special bonding that only that kind of environment can bring on.

The real star of this movie is the fire. They are all consuming and very unpredictable. But we watch as these men run into burning buildings, when all others run out. Why do they do such a thing? Because they may be able to save someone. It is this over whelming desire to help others, regardless of the cost to themselves that make them heroes.

2164118,3,B00063MAXQ,"I went into the Theater to see a film that was hailed as ""Backdraft, but real."" Apparently there is some flack over ""Backdraft"" in the firefighter community, and this movie was to show me the ""Real"" fire fighting.

The film is a frame story, with The Main character looking back on his life as a fire fighter while trying to escape the burning deathtrap he is plunged into. The story flips from the present day with his Captain ((Played by John Travolta)) trying to lead him out of the fire, and then back to a moment of choice in the past or some other pertanat character defining moment.

In the end the story is passible, but I came out of the theater wanting more. It is a good drama, and is exciting however all the choices made by the main character are made off screen. He resolved himself to be a fire fighter before the film starts and I never felt he seriously thought about quitting. Because the main character never seems to make an active choice to stay a fire fighter ((sure he questions his resolve, but we never see him leave fire fighting and come back, or even take a desk job and then go back to the front lines)). This apparent lack of choice gave the films resolution a bit of an emotional hollowness, because I never figured it would end any other way.

I liked the way the film was shot, and I felt the music was appropriate, however the story over all rings a bit hollow. I would have loved to seen the moment where the main character said ""Yes I want to be a fireman, that's all I have ever wanted to be.""

2164119,4,B00063MAXQ,"Ladder 49 is less a film about firefighters and more a tribute to the men who put their lives on the line to save others.  It's a routine, but nonetheless rousing, film in which Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) reminisces about his life as he lies trapped in a burning building as his fellow firefighters struggle to get to him.  At times, Ladder 49 can be a bit hokey with the similar story elements that are plenty apparent (such as the concern from Jack's wife over the lack of safety of what he does for a living), and at times it is predictable, but the film's ending packs a good punch.  The film is an excellent showcase for Phoenix as he gives a great performance as an unselfish and underappreciated hero, while John Travolta provides a just as great performance as Jack's mentor and firehouse captain, while the film is capably directed by Jay Russell.  The rest of the finally chosen cast includes Robert Patrick, an underused Balthazar Getty, Jay Hernandez, Tim Guinee, and Morris Chestnut, who it is great to see in a movie that doesn't have Steven Seagle in it.

And yet, midway through it, I realized it wasn't just another ""Backdraft"" or run-of-the-mill firefighter guy flick, but rather, an honest depiction of a harrowing profession that requires not just bravery, but also tremendous faith and focus.  Joaquin Pheonix delivers a terrific performance as a rookie fireman assigned to a close knit unit in Baltimore.  We see him grow from a newbie to a brave partner who in the end, risks his life to save others with a selfless quality that all firemen have, but few actors have so effectively played on film.  John Travolta as the Chief firefighter and mentor to his team, is also very solid. There are lighthearted moments to be sure, but most of all, this is an affecting drama that highlights the courage and tenacity of the men and women who battle neighborhood blazes day in and day out.  I have always respected the bravery of our cops and firefighters, but rarely has a film about these heroes brought such humanity into the mix.  It's an emotional rollercoaster ride that's well worth watching.",1109462400,3,1097,4.808510638297872

Most of the movie is played in flashback mode, which is fine, as long as the flashbacks are showing you how the first showed scene came about - but this movie doesn't.  The whole movie is a review of happenings in a firefighter's life that all seem utterly cliche.  The only drama comes from the scenes where they're fighting fires, and they didn't create  intense enough situations.  The fires LOOKED like they were staged on a set.  I'm thinking they must have blown their budget on getting Travolta and Jaoquin, who were both surprisingly flat in their acting.

2164122,4,B00063MAXQ,"Ladder 49 is one of those movies that I never would consider seeing except I was given the movie as a gift.  So, I put it in on Friday night and for the next two hours I was absolutely transfixed.

The movie starts out where it ends; Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) is trapped in a deadly fire and as he lays waiting for help, he thinks about the past 10 years of his life, both personally and professionally.  The story alternates between Jack's past and the present and I felt it was done very well.

The movie shows Jack's professional life as he remembers his first day at the fire station as a rookie and the first fire he fought.  He remembers the little mistakes he made such as forgetting to put on his helmet, and the eagerness and mild apprehension at going into a burning building.  But his mentor and captain (played by John Travolta) was right there with him, showing him the ropes and providing advice and encouragement.  Jack remembers how he grew to be a seasoned firefighter over the next 10 years; he remembers his ""family"" of firefighters and the special friendships he developed; he remembers those special friends and how some were severely injured, and some died.

The movie shows Jack's personal life as he also remembers his wife and children and the difficult times his wife went through as she tried to understand his passion for his job.  Jack realizes that he wasn't always there for his family even though he loved them; that perhaps he spent too much time at his job and not enough time with his family.  But how could Jack choose between the two things he loved - his job and his family.

Ladder 49 is a tribute to firefighters; those men and women who put their lives on the line everyday.  The story takes you inside the firehouse and shows the sense of family that firefighters develop.  It takes you on the scene of the fire and the inherent dangers that firefighters face every time they battle a blaze.  It takes you inside the personal life of firefighters and shows the struggles that their spouse must deal with.  As Jack's wife (played by Jacinda Barrett) states in the movie, ""I never know when that red car will pull up and someone will come to the door to tell me you're gone.""

All-in-all, Ladder 49 is a pretty good movie.  Both Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta are, without question, good actors and Joaquin clearly has the title lead in this story.  It is a disaster movie but didn't have the ""blood and guts"" of most movies of this sort (thank you Jay Russell).  It does have quite an emotional impact and I think most people will enjoy it.",1109376000,,2590,4.507494646680942
2164123,4,B00063MAXQ,"Ladder 49 tells the story of one fireman (Joaquim Phoenix) as he joins the department as a ""probie"" and advances in experience and bravery in the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD), except it is told through flashbacks of sort.

At the beginning of the movie, we see the main conflict of the movie.  A large 15-story or so abandoned grain mill on the docks of Baltimore Harbor catches fire and ""Engine 33"" is called to action.  Engine 33?  Yes, the firehouse unit is Engine 33, its ladder truck (Fire & Rescue Unit) is ""Ladder 49"".  In this ""battle"" our main character (Joaquim Phoenix) finds himself in a bit of a pinch, if you will.  We then follow his journey through the department from his probie days to a veteran firefighter through, like I said, flashbacks.  It's a very interesting way of editing this film.  Instead of time lapsed story telling in a chronological manner, we start off by seeing, what ultimately, is the end for our main hero.

In the flashbacks, we see him growing as a fireman as they get called to many fires as some of his fellow firemen get killed or seriously injured.  We also see him develop a love interest into a full blown family with two kids.  Like I said, the flashbacks tell a story in severe time lapse.  The whole story must've taken place over a period of at least 5 years or more, because one of the deleted scenes is one of 9/11.  Deleted scenes?  How would I know about that 2 weeks before release date?  A litte birdy at Amazon.com told me so. ;)

Anyway, about the DVD.  Great little DVD.  The transfer is a nice, if not a little grainy 1.85 anamorphic transfer.  I say a little grainy, because it was probably intentional.  Oh don't get me wrong, it's a clean tranfer, but it appears the movie was shot with a bit of a documentary look to it.  The sound is superb.  Coming in a DD 5.1 track that claims that it is an ""enhanced track for home theaters"", it really has some nice directional effects that makes the fire scenes sound like the fire is all around you with panning effects from front to rear.

Included are a couple nice little features.  A 22-minute ""Making of"" special split into 4 smaller segments with a Play All feature.  Very informative docu.  No CG fire in this film.  What you see is real.  Then we have a 13 minute feature called ""Everyday Heroes"" that tells the story of real-life Baltimore firemen.  Then 13-minutes of deleted scenes, one of which is the 1.5 minute '9/11' scene that I previously mentioned.  Rounding out the special features is a audio commentary by the director Jay Russell and editor Bud Smith.

So in the end, we have a nice little DVD that could be used as a demo disc for your HT system.  If you liked Backdraft, pick up Ladder 49.  But I warn you, it's a bit of a tear jerker at some points because this film focuses on the heroism of everyday firemen as opposed to Backdraft's internal affairs corruption.",1109376000,,2905,4.461977186311787
2164124,3,B00063MAXQ,"The connotation of heroism is inescapable when discussing professional firefighters, especially in the wake of 9/11.  Let's face it, the person running into the burning building when everyone else is desperately trying to get out is going to be a hero in the eyes of many, and in ""Ladder 49,"" directed by Jay Russell and starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta, it is the hero and that sense of heroism that is presented and explored.

The film follows the career of fireman Jack Morrison (Phoenix) from his rookie days through the following years as he establishes himself as a veteran of the firehouse, all under the tutelage of Captain Mike Kennedy (Travolta), who is always on hand to listen, question and impart the wisdom of age and experience to Jack, especially at pivotal times in his life.

Over a period of time, Jack learns the ropes, develops his firefighting skills, matures and, along the way, learns about life and love.  When he meets an attractive young woman in a grocery store, Linda (Jacinda Barrett), and sparks fly, it isn't hard to figure out where this part of the story is going.

Visually, the film is stunning at times:  The fires are spectacular, you can fairly feel the heat from the flames, which is bound to instill in one admiration for the firefighters who risk it all in the performance of their duties.  It gives a perspective, as well, to the way living with danger binds them together in a special way.  On the other hand, the way in which Russell presents this bonding also gives the impression that these are people who somehow live apart from the commoners, that the air they breathe is perhaps a bit more rarefied than what is available to the rest of us.

The flaw of what is essentially a decent film can be placed directly in the lap of the director, who makes the mistake of putting his heroes on a pedestal right out of the gate, for no other reason than the fact that they are firemen, and in doing so he allows what could have been a riveting drama to lapse into unnecessary melodrama, which very nearly sinks the ship early on.  He makes the camaraderie of the firehouse, for instance, an exercise in cliche, while allowing his actors to struggle with the development of their characters.

Phoenix gives a passable performance as Jack, but Travolta comes across as an actor playing a role the way he ""thinks"" it should be played, rather than creating a real identity for Mike, and Russell lets him get away with it.  In a similar role, in 1974's ""The Towering Inferno,"" Steve McQueen put real life into Chief Michael O'Hallorhan by creating his character from the inside out, using an introspective approach to establish O'Hallorhan the man first, then O'Hallorhan the hero secondarily, and it worked.  What is unfortunate here, especially, is the fact that Travolta is a much better actor than what Russell allowed him to be.

The supporting cast includes Robert Patrick (Lenny); Morris Chestnut (Tommy); Billy Burke (Dennis); Balthazar Getty (Ray); Desiree Care (Maria); and Deidra LaWan Starnes (Marlene).  Firefighters and their families are no doubt going to find themselves on an emotional roller coaster with this film, and given what they live with on a daily basis, that is entirely understandable.  For everyone else, however, ""Ladder 49"" will be somewhat entertaining, even emotionally engaging at times, but not entirely memorable.",1109376000,,3396,4.849480968858131
2164125,4,B00063MAXQ,"I think that most folks took firefighters for granted before 9/11. I do not think that we do so now.

This is a movie about fire  fighters. I will not discuss the plot, because that would spoil the experience of seeing this very good film for  the first time.

Joaquin Phoenix plays Jack Morrison, a rookie fire fighter at the beginning of the movie. John Travolta plays the Captain of the unit Phoenix joins, and mentors him through his career. Jacinda Barret plays Phoenix's wife. All do excellent jobs.

While there is plenty of action and special effects, the human side of fire fighting is center stage. We see the shortchanging aspects of family life that exposure to constant danger can occasion. We see the real brotherhood that exists between fire fighters and the effects of injury and death on this small group of men.

The technical aspects of this DVD are excellent. There are none of the ""extra features"" that some like, but the movie itself is extremely enjoyable -- and thought provoking.

2164127,3,B00063MAXQ,"This is not a great movie, it is not an original movie. It is another one of Hollywood's pencil pushers ""take no risk and use formulas that are sure to work"" offerings. It is cliche ridden, and extremely predictable. However!!! It is well done, and it is very entertaining. This movie does have its charm, and it has a way of drawing you in.

The story is told both in flashback and present day sequences as Jack (Phoenix) is trapped in a burning building cut off from his squad, while the conditions of his surroundings are deteriorating rapidly. Through flashback we are taken back to his first day on the job, and his bonding with his co-workers, his meetiing and marrying his wife (Jacinda Barrett), and his witnessing the death and injury of a couple of his co-workers. In the present, we see his co-workers' desperate attempts to rescue him as they are urged on by a relentless and determined Captain (Travolta).

As one who was a firefighter (30 years ago in Detroit) I found the procedures to be questionable - perhaps the way I was tought all those years ago is obsolete now. The action sequences are good, but like most movies about firefighting, they are far from accurate. If an accurate firefighting scene was to be filmed, all you would see is smoke and an orange glow when you got to the fire. You can see absolutely nothing in a burning building but smoke. No one who knows me will watch a firefighting movie with me.

There are some tense moments that are well directed and acted. The emotional moments are compelling despite being predictable and contrived. Perhaps I was drawn in because I was once a fireman and I know the sacrifice these people make and what it takes to run into a burning building. It definatly ain't money that urges the fire fighter into those situations. It is, a love of the job and a sense of duty.

If you are looking for something profound, original and thought provoking, then this is not the movie for you. If you are looking to be entertained and have your emotional strings tugged a bit, then this is a perfect movie for you. It is a great tribute to firefighters and a decent insight into who they are.

Well, if you like a movie that has a weak, better yet, no storyline and tries to manipulate your emotions, then this one is for you.

This movie is made up of scenes from a firefighter's life. While many of the scenes are interesting and/or funny the point of a movie is to tell a story. This movie tells a story but the story consists of:

See Jack join fire department.
See Jack joke and hang out with other firefighters.
See Jack put out fires.
blah, blah, blah

Oh, let me not forget. every 10 minutes or so this movie likes to reach out and grab your emotions and make you feel happy/sad. I found this aspect of the movie to be very annoying and manipulative.

2164135,5,B00063MAXQ,"Despite what a lot of people are thinking, this movie did not start out as a tribute to the 9/11 firefighters. It was a tribute to the Worcester (MA) Firefighters, or the ""Worcester Six""  They had a lot of the scenes of the movie shot already, but the families of the Worcester Six, for whatever reason, did not give their premission for the movie to be made, so the changed some things and this is the movie that resulted. Instead of being based around six firefighters, it was based around one.

It is an incredible movie, and it hits home pretty hard. It gives you a great inside look at firefighting and what these men and women deal with. However, I have been told by many firefighters that the scenes do not even depict how hard it is to see in a fire, the smoke gets much much much ticker and darker.

This movie is a tribute to firefighters everwhere and i know that i've gained a new-found respect for them and what they do. If they didn't have any problems with the movie, no real critisims, i don't see how anyone else could.",1102204800,2,1036,4.329896907216495

Incredibly accurate with only some minor changes to make the movie workable (ie: If it was as smoky in the movie as buildings are in real life you would see nothing. NOTHING).

Enough people have commented on the great aspects of the movie, so I want to address a few criticisms:

People have said the movie is too predictable, with no plot surprises. The reason for this is they wanted to make the movie accurate. This is a movie about real people in real life' if you want a Hollywood script with a million twists and turns go somewhere else. If you want to really know what its like to be the people who are out there 24/7/365 in every place in this country putting their lives on the line for you, see this movie.

A lot of criticism has been thrown at the jokes and pranks played in the movie. None of the critics claim to have been firefighters, otherwise they would have known better. IT REALLY HAPPENS! We play jokes on each other all the time at the station, and the ones in Ladder 49 are pretty representative.

People die in this movie. Apparently some critics were surprised by this, and said it was predictable. Well no duh! Firefighting by its very nature is an extremely hazardous job, and unfortunately my brothers die frequently. In the line of duty 441 died in 2001 (343 on 9/11), 100 died in 2002, and 111 in 2003. I didn't have to look any of these numbers up by the way.

To conclude: This is an overall great movie. If you have any interest in firefighting, go see it. If you want to know more about the people who drive by on the trucks with the flashing lights, go see it. If you want to see an entertaining and thoughtful movie, go see it. Just see it.

Ater 9/11, I honestly thought the director would try to gloss up firefighting and veer away from the hard realities, sacrifices and sheer courage required by those men who choose to stay the course, day in and day out.

  Instead, this movie had integrity, heart and, just as importantly, a riveting story. Told from the perspective of a rookie firefigher and his captain, it careened from one exciting moment to the next but also showed the toll firefighting can take on marriages and personal lives.

There, however most of the similarity ends, as this is most definitely a thought provoking drama, rather than an action flick. The pyrotechnics and visual effects are of course impressive, but they take a back seat to a gritty and realistic story that underpins the whole picture. Rather than ""A Day in the Life"" style flick, this is more like a ""Life in One Day"" (or just over 90 minutes to be precise) condensed story of firefighter Jack Morrison, played extremely competently by Joaquin Phoenix. The opening scene finds a 4 alarm fire in Baltimore harbor, and our character becomes trapped in the unsafe inferno after an explosion, and begins to reflect on his life. Therein lies the story quite simply - we are shown in flashback sequences his journey from fresh faced single rookie, to seasoned pro with wife, family, responsibility and everything in between. There are some funny moments, the usual male bonding scenes, but always a sober reflection, that is never heavy handed on a difficult job, done day in and day out by many unsung heroes across the country. John Travolta as the fire chief, station commander, friend and mentor is excellent, and seems in my mind to get better as he gets older as an actor. This is not a special effects junkies movie, nor is it plodding biopic, but balances the two well, and makes for absorbing viewing. Dramatic and at times harrowing, this is not a movie for a younger audience, but I heartily recommend it to anyone who has ever been interested in the real work of the emergency services.

2164142,4,B00063MAXQ,"As Hollywood often pays tribute to America's police, Armed Forces, teachers, and athletic coaches, it's a bit of a surprise that the movies haven't given firemen their due - especially after 9/11. LADDER 49 goes some way to remedy this.

As the film opens, veteran fireman Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) enters the towering inferno of a burning industrial structure - perhaps reminiscent of the World Trade Center - to search for the living. After saving a life, Jack is pitched by collapsing floors into the basement, where he's trapped by rubble and menaced by falling debris. Still in radio communication with the outside, he awaits rescue or certain death. Throughout the ordeal, the audience  flashbacks through Jack's ten years on the job, starting with his first day as a probationer assigned to Engine Company 33 of the Baltimore City Fire Department. As the years pass, the boyishly charming Morrison falls in love with and weds wife Linda (Jacinda Barrett), has kids, and sees fellow fireman die or become seriously injured. The job exacts its toll on Jack's marriage and psyche, but he's continually supported by his spouse, the camaraderie of his extended family of colleagues in the engine company, and the paternalistic master of his fire station, Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta).

There are no particular plot surprises in LADDER 49, but it rises above being average via excellent special FX and strong, sympathetic performances by both Phoenix and Travolta. This viewer truly cared about Jack, his family, and his work buddies. (It doesn't hurt that America loves, or should love, its firefighters. They are, after all, both heroic and inoffensive at the same time. The same can't be said of those uniformed and armed agencies, the police and military, both of which get embroiled in political and social divisiveness as perceived agents of whatever political power base is being lambasted.)

LADDER 49 depicts the male bonding and friendly horseplay that occurs between the close knit members of a firefighting company, even to the ritual hazing of the New Guy when he reports aboard. At no point was the New Guy the New Gal, a venture into political correctness and potential humor that the scriptwriters chose not to take.

Nothing major, like where they parked one of the engines was bit too close to the fire, and I was taught to never give your breathing apparatus to a victim (they may fight you to keep it).

Jacinda Barrett is cast as the young fireman's wife.  The film spans a period of 10 years.  During this time we see the young couple meet, marry and have some very cute children.  We watch the time-worn clich about how the wife worries about the husband and wants him to stop his dangerous life.  Naturally, he doesn't change though and he just gets braver and braver.  There's a lot of camaraderie and good-natured horseplay among the men.  But they all respect each other and it's a tight-knit group.  Eventually, our hero is trapped in a burning building with no way out. The plot is predictable.  And the acting is adequate.

But this film is more than just about the plot.  It is about the fires.  And I must say I sat in that theater absolutely transfixed as I was thrust into what looked like the reality of it all.  I've seen other films and also have read about fires.  But this film brought me right there.  I was inside all the burning buildings depicted in the film.  I might not have felt the actual heat of the fires, but I did feel their unpredictability and the randomness in which tragedy can occur.  I also have nothing but admiration for the work that firefighters do, especially when they have to actually go into the buildings when everyone else is rushing out.

2164146,3,B00063MAXQ,"I saw this movie today and I am still trying to decide what I thought. This was not a bad film. It just was not a great film. It is the story of one man in a fire department. It follows the life of Jack, a young firefighter from his first day on the job until a major fire several years later. I found a lot of the plot predictable. I leaned over to my wife on many occasions and said this will happen next or of course they have to introduce this character for this reason which did finally pan out as I had thought.

It was enjoyable. The fire scenes were top notch and Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. However, there was very little character development for anyone but Jack. There were other men in the firehouse and there were several occasions we were asked to care for them but the writers and director had not given us enough emotional connections to make that happen. In the end I didn't care for the characters and that is a bad thing to say about a movie that obviously was trying to get me to cry.

The movie was not without merit. Some of the finest acting came when Joaquin Phoenix did not speak. The subtext he brought across with simple looks was incredible. The worst acting came from John Travolta. I have never been a big Travolta fan but in this film in particular in his most emotionally charged scene, his acting was atrocious. Here he is yelling at the men of the fire house after a tragedy and I am laughing. His acting was so bad here. I have seen seventh graders deliver lines better.

Overall, I think this is a good rental flick. If you haven't seen it, you can wait. Joaquin Phoenix is proving again that he is a star in the making.

 Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta as the leading cast, and set in the gritty neighborhoods of Baltimore, it's the story of a ten year veteran firefighter named Jack Morrison under the advice of his mentor who during the worst fire of his career at an industrial complex reflects on his lifetime leading up to the industrial fire as he tries to escape from the place. The complex that he's trapped in is partially collapsing and he's trapped in a space with debris all around him and the whole place threatens to collapse at any time with all of the chemical explosives around the place.

 This is a really marvelous movie that I thought was a lot better than I thought it would be.

 Many have criticize parts of ""Backdraft"" due to some unrealistic things about it and I've noticed flaws in it, while I'll always enjoy that one, ""Ladder 49"" in my opinion corrects some of those flaws and the result is a much more realistic looking movie.

 Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta put on an excellent duo role as firefighter and mentor chief and Travolta especially in my opinion really gets back on his feet after the effects of that horrible 2000 atrocity that was ""Battlefield Earth"".

The end result is mixed. Some cardboard lighter moments evoked laughter in the theater. The fire action itself is good but not great, especially if you've seen the likes of ""Backdraft"".

The script is formulaic and the dialogue predictable, but this seems like the right moment for a good-natured movie celebrating these guys, their training and discipline.  In its simple sincerity, this succeeds in being strongly patriotic while being completely non-partisan.  This is greatly appreciated in an election year.

Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful as a rescuer who gets trapped in a burning building while his captain, played by John Travolta, makes split-second decisions about how, or whether, to send teams into the inferno to find him.  We flash back over his ten-year career as a firefighter, who met his wife while he was still a rookie, and we watch as his family grows and his career flourishes.  Watch the performances of all the other firefighters: what a truthful and enjoyable collection of people.

Without spoiling any surprises, it seemed to me that this production would have had a different ending if it had been made before the events of 9/11.

The cinematography of this film is brilliant - camera angles, unique points of view - I could tell from the opening fire scene, when the shot moves to the reflection of the burning building in a puddle of water, that this was going to be a different movie.  It has great action scenes, heartfelt love scenes, and, best of all, it doesn't glorify firefighters. I thought that post-9/11, this movie would be all about making these men seem larger-than-life, but it didn't.  All it did, in my opinion, was give some credit to guys who risk thier lives every day for us.

I would recommend this movie for everybody - if you like a good intellectual movie, you'll be blown away by the acting and simplicity, but if you're just in the mood for an action movie, there's a lot of explosions too.

Great, great ending, one that really sticks with you.",1097539200,7,1163,4.5576923076923075
2164154,3,B00063MAXQ,"This movie was caught up in a boring love story. The movie was really long and it could have been shorter with less love scenes. I thought this movie was going to be packed with action. I was so excited. As soon as he met the girl in the store, I knew what was going to happen. They would fall in love and then he would get hurt in a rescue. The movie was too predictable. There is still action and some comedy in it, so it wasn't a horrible movie. Guys.... if you are getting suckered into seeing a chick flick with romance and love, see Ladder 49 because it is a compromise between an action movie and a love movie.",1097452800,,617,4.065573770491803

2164156,5,B00063MAXQ,"I was expecting a riveting action film, and Ladder 49 delivers, but it also gives you so much more. I was drawn into the love story--which for once, wasn't all Hollywood but a realistic telling of how two people find each other and commit their lives to one another in marriage. It's truly a great story of friendship, courage, character, heroism, and self-sacrifice. But Ladder 49 isn't preachy. The action sequences will grab you; the fire scenes are so realistic, they are truly frightening. And the love story is heartwarming. I think this is a wonderful film for couples and families.",1097452800,2,589,4.841584158415841
2164157,5,B00063MAXQ,"Ladder 49 opens its audiences eyes to the reality of a firefighter's job. It shows us how hard they work to save peoples' lives; they risk their own.

The movie's about a fire fighter (played by 'Gladiator''s and 'The Village''s Joaquin Phoenix) who is trapped in a burning building and through out the movie he relives his life just when he became a rookie fire fighter, to his first outings with his future wife, to the first time he went from hosing down fires, to rescuing a man, and to the birth of his first child, and to his rewarding of successful achievement. In the end something tragic happens, which will lead to you crying your eyes out, and finding a new respect for fire fighters.

You will be totally blown away from this movie, this is some of its leading actors' best performances.

You'll laugh, you'll gasp, you'll cry, you'll have a good time at this movie.",1097366400,,878,4.544303797468355

A little comedy, romance, action, and emotional tear jerking moments that will keep anyone's attention with a pulse. Phoenix and Travolta are both the standouts in the acting department and they deliver the goods here. This movie almost borderlined into the ""sappy"" region but thankfully stayed away for the most part. A must see on the BIG screen and will be added to my DVD collection right beside Backdraft. 4.5 Stars out of 5!",1097366400,,553,4.595959595959596
2164159,4,B00063MAXQ,"Ladder 49 is an excellent movie that tells the complete story of firemen, not just a two hour movie of constant fires and explosions.  Ladder 49, Engine 33 is one of the Baltimore Fire Department's Fire Houses.  When a huge warehouse with two workers inside begins to blaze, Ladder 49 is called in to try and bring them out.  After saving the first man, firefighter Jack Morrison manages to find and save the other victim.  As he tries to help, the grain dust in the buidling explodes causing the floors to cave in and throwing Morrison down several floors.  Will the men of Ladder 49 be able to get to Morrison before it is too late?  The movie is told in flashback beginning with Jack's first day at the fire house and through his many years at Ladder 49, while also showing the efforts of the other firefighters to save him in the burning building.  The movie does have plenty of action, but it also details what a firefighter's life is like.  Ladder 49 shows their personal problems at home, the constant waiting for that alarm that could go off at anytime, and also the fires they try to put out and the people they try to save.  Highly recommended for an excellent portrayal of the life of a firefighter.

  Joaquin Phoenix is very good as firefighter Jack Morrison.  By the end of the movie, you come to feel like you really know this person.  John Travolta is turns in a fine performance as Captain Mike Kennedy, head of Ladder 49 and a father figure to Jack.  Jacinda Barrett plays Jack's wife Linda, who lives in fear of what might happen to her husband while he is on duty.  This could have been a stereotypical worried wife role, but Barrett is excellent in the part.  The other firefighters of Ladder 49 include Morris Chestnut, Robert Patrick, Billy Burke, Balthazar Getty, Tim Guinee, Kevin Chapman, and Jay Hernandez.  Chestnut and Patrick are great in their parts.  I can't wait for the DVD for this movie to see what kind of extras are included.  For an excellent drama with great action, the right blend of comedy, a great cast, and excellent story, check out Ladder 49!",1097193600,3,2089,4.53475935828877
2164160,5,B00063MAXQ,"When I left the theatre it occurred to me that I haven't seen many Movies or TV shows with firefighters.  Very odd.  I have lived through every genre including Westerns, Wars, Docs, Monsters, Spies, Space Travelers, Time Travelers, Cops, Lawyers and more Lawyers but NO FIREMEN!  So, having said that -- I guess it's about time that Hollywood celebrated these heros.

Firehouses are filled with families.  Families care, families fight, families pull together. The acting was genuine.  I laughed and I cried.  These men view their lives - their jobs - as a calling. How many of us have a calling?

Travolta was very good.  I left feeling proud.

I'm not sure the producers left room for a sequel but if they decide to make one -- I'm in.  More buttered popcorn please.",1097193600,2,768,4.6992481203007515
2164161,5,B00063MAXQ,"You're safe reading this review if you haven't seen the film.

It's a touching story about the sacrifices Firemen make every day in keeping us out of harm's way. I thought I'd never see a film with firemen in it that I'd like more than Backdraft.

But I do.

If you loved Backdraft, it is Imperative that you go see Ladder 49.

One thing that will make you smile about this film is how much of a community the firemen in this movie have. They have their conflicts and of course, there's always a knucklehead in the crew, but if you miss a sense of community in America, this is where it's at.

If you're emotionally sensitive, go see another film right after it or you might cry all night. :-D",1097193600,3,693,4.259541984732825
2164162,5,B00063MAXQ,"I saw Ladder 49 on the night of it's premiere, and I have to say that it was a very great film. The theatre had reserved hundreds of seats for firefighters and their families. It was amazing. This film dealt with so many different emotions that you couldn't help but cry by the end of the film. Great acting on both Phoenix and Travolta's parts. They also had an amazing support cast! If people say that it was made to profit off of 9/11, don't believe them. The film was about honoring firefighters, and that is what it did. My Grandfather (1931-1998) was a fire chief. I am so glad that I was able to see this film with my father, and in a way, I believe my Grandpa was there with me. He would've loved this film. It's films like these that inspire me to continue in my film-making career. This film is a must-see for anyone...Thanks for reading.!",1096934400,3,849,4.3125

2164164,5,B00063MAXQ,"Movies don't get any better than ""Ladder 49"", one of the most thrilling and powerful motion pictures ever made since 1991's ""Backdraft""! The direction of Jay Russell (""Tuck Everlasting"") is nothing short of dynamic or triumphant! The performances of superstars Joaquin Phoenix (""Signs"", ""The Village"") and John Travolta (""The Punisher"", ""Face/Off"") were tour de force and instantly unforgettable ones at that! Joining them are Jacinda Barrett (""The Human Stain""), Morris Chestnut (""Half Past Dead""), Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""), Balthazar Getty (""Deuces Wild""), and Billy Burke (""Along Came A Spider"") in excellent supporting performances!

""Ladder 49"" introduces us to the life of Jack Morrison (Phoenix), a firefighter for the Baltimore City Fire Department. Jack is assigned to Fire Station 33 as a pipe-man for Ladder 49 (Note: The pipe-man holds the water hose nozzle and sprays water onto the fire.) As a new probationary firefighter, Jack is assigned all the little jobs at the firehouse. Station 33 Captain Mike Kennedy (Travolta), and the other veteran firefighters (including Patrick, Chestnut, Getty, and Burke) love to play jokes on the new rookies, including Jack. Captain Kennedy takes Jack under his wing to make him the best firefighter in the city. Time passes, and Jack is now a seasoned veteran on the rescue team. Ladder 49 has been called on a four-alarm fire to a burning 20-story building. Kennedy, now promoted to Fire Chief, is in command of the fire. Jack and the rescue team brave the fire to rescue anyone trapped inside. They save several people, and Jack continues to search for others. Jack finds a man and lowers him to safety, just before the floor collapses around him. Jack falls through the building into the middle of the inferno, and is rendered unconscious. When he awakens, Jack is able to radio to his men that he is alive. Now Jack is the one who needs to be rescued. Chief Kennedy coordinates the effort to save Jack. Awaiting rescue, Jack begins to relive his life with his wife Linda (Barrett) and kids, and his career through flashbacks.

Where ""Ladder 49"" departs from the ""Backdraft"" mold is in the way it approaches its working-class characters. Director Russell shows, through Jack, that these are unquestionably brave men who believe in brotherhood and family, but hold them second to the thrill of fighting flames. Russell does a superb job capturing the blue-collar feel of ""Ladder 49"", with its portrayals of marital stress, male bonding, and neighborhood fire fighting in Baltimore. The audience is made to feel a part of the team, with Russell even going that extra mile and giving the crowds a POV shot of a fireman sliding down a brass pole! OK, so maybe that's a little much, but the rest of ""Ladder"" finds an emotional core to latch onto, deeply feeling the characters' plights, and investing a heartfelt interest in their fates.

Most of the reason why ""Ladder"" resonates so much is the cast, led by a tender, gripping performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix has a tough role; he must convey ten years of character growth in just under two hours, which has sent lesser actors screaming out of the business. Phoenix navigates these heady waters with confidence, starting off as Jack in his shy, newbie glow as a rookie fireman, and nurturing him towards adulthood, where he starts a family and searches for more responsibility at his firehouse. Phoenix plays the role with elegance, bringing Jack from mousy boy to confident man without the change feeling forced. It's a tremendous performance from Phoenix. Also welcome is John Travolta (coming from a villainous turn in last April's ""The Punisher""), who, in a very un-Travolta move, seems content to stand in the background for most of the film, only occasionally stepping up to deliver a speech or two (or dance, with Jacinda Barrett), though they are ace speeches. A nice supporting turn that he should look into more often.

And ""Ladder 49"" doesn't disappoint when it comes time to get audience into the fire. Russell stages these moments well, delivering on the promise of thrills and curiosity that goes into fighting fires. However, these sequences do not define what makes ""Ladder"" such a special film. There's a deeper story here, which involves a healthy dose of tragedy that grabs you faster than any orange ball of flame ever could, and that's the best way to dramatize the hard work of a firefighter. It's not the hardware, but the heart, courage, and loyalty that ""Ladder 49"" captures so well.

In conclusion, one line in the movie states it all: ""Everyone is running out of a burning building and only the firefighters are running into the fire."" ""Ladder 49"" shows how brave our firefighters are and why we should honor them. ""Ladder 49"", without a doubt, is an instant DVD must-have when released!",1096848000,9,4844,4.982694684796044
