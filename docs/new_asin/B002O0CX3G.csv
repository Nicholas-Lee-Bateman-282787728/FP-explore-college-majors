Polytechnique the film certainly paints a brutal picture of what happened during the Polytechnique massacre. The filmmakers spoke with many of the actual victims of this tragedy when making this film, so I'm sure they were as close as possible with details of the event.

Very notable performances from Vanasse and Sbastien Huberdeau as two (fictional) victims of the event. It was interesting to see the events of the film portrayed first through Huberdeau's character perspective followed by Vanasse's. Maxim Gaudette was very intense as the killer.

Fans of Karine Vanasse will enjoy this film, but just know this is a very different side of her from Pan Am. This film really shows the depth she is capable of.  In addition to her role, Vanasse also was one of the producers of this film.",1324771200,5,984,4.776470588235294
