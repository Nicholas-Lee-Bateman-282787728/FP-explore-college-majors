8734377,5,B015RTPNY6,"You will thoroughly enjoy this if you are an opera fan. Maria Callas had this incredible full, robust voice, that was so melodic and beautiful too. The only other opera singer that could even approach Maria Callas for vocal quality, was Renata Tibaldi. It is so sad that Maria Callas literally sang herself to death. Her round the world tour with Guiseppi Destefano really finished her off. She had heart problems.",1504569600,,414,4.845070422535211

But you need to have a region free player, or at least one that will play region B titles to view it. Fortunately, I also purchased the PANASONIC DMP-BDT270 2K/4K Multi Region All System Blu Ray Disc DVD Player from Amazon as well, and it looks superb!",1450137600,,331,4.442622950819672
8734380,4,B015RTPNY6,"This is a review of the blu ray edition of Maria Callas at Covent Garden 1962 & 1964. As regards picture quality,
which, strangely, many reviewers of DVDs and Blu Rays on Amazon seem reluctant to address, two things may
be said: 1) these performances, by one of the few genuine recent legends of the operatic world, need to be on a medium
such as blu ray, and 2) all but the most modest expectations as to picture quality are doomed to disappointment.
Having owned these performances in previous incarnations (dvds, etc.), I can attest that there is little, if any, improvement
in image quality from dvd to blu ray--the source material, which was wonderful for its day (early 1960s) is now clearly shown
to be quite wretchedly bad in terms of what we are accustomed to nowadays. The 1962 selections (Callas doing an aria from Verdi's
""Don Carlo"" and two selections from Carmen with two orchestral interludes led by Georges Pretre interspersed) are at least
watchable. The fully staged  second act of Puccini's Tosca (Covent Garden, 1964) is, alas, the most wretched from the standpoint
of picture quality.
I say ""alas"" because the performance of both Callas and Gobbi are possibly both nonpareil--Tosca may be glorified trash at best, but
it is so exciting to watch these artists play it to the hilt for whatever it may be worth. The emotions conveyed by both are visceral
and thrilling, transcending the darkness of the staging. Were the performances any less superb, one would certainly come away
with the impression that the whole act is staged in a cave and would never be inclined to watch it again. Here, at least great art has
transcended the technical limitations of the medium through which it is delivered to us. The 1962 aria, ""Tu che la vanita"" has better
image quality and Callas also does justice to it. The same cannot be said for (alas!) for her ""Carmen"" offerings from the same year.
We know that Callas had never sung Carmen in a full-fledged opera on stage. Comparison of her in either the Habanera or Segudille
as presented here  with such an artist as, say, Anna Caterina Antonacci, in either her blu ray (Covent Garden) or dvd version (John Eliot
Gardner, Theatre Comique) is embarrassing--and not for Antonacci, but for Callas. What is worse, Callas seems not to be
interested so much in getting into the character of Carmen as in mugging for the audience as she bathes in the adulation that comes from
that quarter. This is actually uncomfortable to watch and reminds us that Callas, great as were her gifts, was forced into studying to
be a opera singer by her mother, who apparently wanted to triumph vicariously over her own frustrations. We are reminded too, that
this was the Onassis period of Maria Callas' life, when she was focused on being a glamorous jet setter rather than the serious artist
she had been. Yet, such was the magnitude of her talent and the power of her concentration that it may not be possible to say
that she ever gave a really bad performance. Still, one has the uncomfortable feeling that she is on the brink of such a performance
in these Carmen offerings. By the way, the infectiousness of the orchestral interludes led by Pretre seem to highlight the routineness
of the Callas vocals.
What to make of all this, then? If you are a serious collector of opera recordings, you need to have this disc if only for the ""Tosca,""
wretched though the picture quality may be. The sound, which I have not previously mentioned, is acceptable for performances
of this vintage. I would gladly give this four and one half stars if it were possible, in spite of my reservations about the technical
quality--this is probably as good as these performances have ever looked or are likely to look in the foreseeable future. If one's
expectations are appropriately modified, this disc will not disappoint.",1449100800,7,3841,4.7657657657657655
