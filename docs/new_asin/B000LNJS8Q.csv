Waris Shah is a Punjabi movie....watching this movie you will slowly slowly start melting...although being a punjabi movie one may think that it cannot be understood...but on the contrary while watching the movie you will enjoy the melody of the language too. This movie is more of living, more of experiencing than thinking about it.....
While writing ""Heer"" Waris Shah is asked how are you going to end this story of yours......Waris Shah said first of all I am just the medium ""Heer"" is descending on him and second he doesn't know the next thing he will write....so its up to him how God ends.

A movie which is missed....watching Shah Rukh Khan is ok, is good but if one wants to experience some drops of real love....one should watch this...this movie can shake people...can bring them out of internet love...into real love.

Aj aakhan Waris Shah nun, kiton kabraan vichchon bol,
Te aj kitab-e-ishq daa koi agla varka phol
Ik roi si dhi Punjab di, tun likh likh maare vaen,
Aj lakhaan dhian rondian, tainun Waris Shah nun kaehn
Uth dardmandaan dia dardia, uth takk apna Punjab",1196553600,,1175,4.75

Without any doubt this is the best punjabi movie ever made. Wonderful and engrossing script is well supported by equally inspiring 18th century set of a punjabi village, cinematography is at its best, music is melodious and well composed, late director Manoj Punj did a remarkable job in managing his cast and as ever gurdas maan excels infront of camera.

Movie is full of verses from the original 'Heer' which are recited from time to time, these verses are in typical punjabi language and some people will not be at ease with these (especially non native speakers)

The only weak link in the movie is actress 'Juhi Chawla', she is clearly not at ease with punjabi language, 'Divya Dutta' who might actually be the lead female character (has more scenes) is at her best after veer zarra.

Movie was well received by critics and won numerous awards in both India and abroad, Gurdas Maan received the best actor award at berlin film festival, this movie was the first punjabi movie ever nominated for Oscars.

Overall, this is not a typical masala movie but infact a masterpiece of punjabi cinema that should serve as benchmark for other punjabi movies.

If you want to buy DVD go to local Indian store (preferably Punjabi), original movie retails for $10/-",1195516800,,1635,4.800711743772242
