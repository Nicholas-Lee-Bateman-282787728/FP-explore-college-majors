This DVD is the next best thing to seeing Dr. Binder in person.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The benefits go beyond just addressing fertility but also helps with sleep and calming nerves (very important when trying to conceive)!

There is also important bonus information such as things to avoid and things to improve conception.  All and all this DVD contains invaluable information that all women hoping to conceive should have.",1353801600,,723,4.925619834710743

8495867,5,B006AZ1YXQ,"Dr. Lori Binder has an easy-to-follow approach in learning the various pressure points for fertility. Information is presented in a simple and clear manner without getting too technical, which can be overwhelming for a person with minimal or no background in alternative/natural approaches addressing fertility.  I found Lori's method of locating pressure points, whether on your own or with the help of a partner, to be helpful and uncomplicated. A full understanding of the human anatomy was not necessary to find the points on your own using Lori's tips.
