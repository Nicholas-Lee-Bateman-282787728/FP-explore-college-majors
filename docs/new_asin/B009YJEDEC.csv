8545249,5,B009YJEDEC,"A wonderful pilot episode, launching what turns out to be a top notch detective series.  While the episodes are about half the running time of others, such as Touch of Frost, Morse, Lewis, etc., the stories are not hurried and they keep you guessing until the end.  I would recommend this highly.",1389225600,2,296,4.673076923076923
