901086,3,6304558422,"I remember seeing the TV comercials for this movie and thinking wow!  Unfortunately, the movie didn't  quite live up to expectations.  I liked many elements of the movie: the premise (a team of Chinese convicts drops  into 1976 Vietman to destroy a US weapons cache), the fight scenes.  However, I hated the combat team that dropped in with Sammo Hung.  These  men are supposed to be hardened crimminals (like the dirty dozen), but  during the movie they do nothing but cringe and whimper and act as comic  relief.  If one guy on the team was like that it would be okay, but to have  an entire combat team made up of cowards ruins the movie.",958780800,2,641,4.48695652173913

I have the Original Laser disc copy and the reason I got this copy was the dubbing,(Which Sucks). HERE ARE THE SCENES THEY CUT  OFF. They actualy cut of the Scene when Samo cuts the girls hand off.(I  have a copy when it realy shows it comes off) Then the fight scenes was  arange difffently.  And they begining of the film has the flag pole scene  cut off. And many more scenes ws remove. All I can say is that SHAME ON ON  THIS PUBLISHER TO REDITED the movie.

901180,4,6304558422,"A pretty great Hong Kong war/action film. It has flaws; some stunt shots that cut away at the wrong moments (probably because they didn't work out in camera), and occasional silliness that undercuts the often serious action. Despite those missteps, there is so much good stuff including a heaping helping of Sammo Hung Kam-Bo's always beautifully creative choreography and stuntwork that the flaws are buried under the magnificence of what is right. Over the top, sometimes amusing, occasionally quite brutal action flick with a surprisingly high body count among the heroes. Even the scenes lifted from American films (like ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""The Deer Hunter"") are given an over the top Hong Kong spin. The opening scene where an Asian soldier gets fed up with the Americans struggling with a flag stuck at half mast during a flag raising ceremony and basically runs up the pole to fix it signals a certain disdain for the capabilities of American actors.

Interesting to see the men recruited from prison portrayed as much more emotionally open than the guerrilla rebel women they join on the mission. The women have been immersed in war and are strictly no-nonsense ass-kickers.",1327708800,2,1185,5.045918367346939
901181,4,6304558422,"Sammo Hung (""Heart of Dragon"") directs and stars as a Chinese prisoner in U.S. custody who, along with 9 other inmates, gets a chance at a full pardon by participating in an epic military endeavor to act as decoys in the destruction of a munitions dump unintentionally left in Vietnam by the Americans.  When the U.S. commando team ordered to do the actual wiping out of the weapons are themselves wiped out in a plane accident, it's up to Sammo and company to complete the task.  Led by Lieutenant Lam (Lam Ching Ying, ""Prodigal Son""), their mission is essentially suicide.  They receive much needed feminine help from 3 brutal Cambodian guerrillas.

The ensemble cast consists largely of old-schoolers who seemed to accompany Mr. Hung on his many projects of the 80s, such as ""Shanghai Express"" and ""My Lucky Stars"".  For our heroes the fighting roles are delegated mostly to Sammo and Yuen Biao (""Knockabout"") but the Vietnamese offer a steady diet of top-notch fu experts like Dick Wei (""Project A""), Yasuaki Kurata (""Legend of a Fighter""), Billy Chow (""Fist of Legend""), and look fast for the great Philip Ko Fei (""8 Diagram Pole Fighter"").  Yuen Wah (""Supercop"") as the nerdy, creepy Vietnamese general, succeeds in the type of role that character-actor Dean Shek (""Warriors Two"") repeatedly failed at throughout the 70s.  At least from my western perspective.

If my rating was based solely on the fisticuffs, this would only receive a 3.  The fighting is top-notch (when not in slow motion) but the vast majority of the action is gun and stunt-based.  All the brawls of any notable length occur in the last 10 minutes of the film and they still ain't all that long.  The gunfights and stunts are exciting but often try a little too hard to impress, especially the numerous takes of one guy shooting 4 or 5 dudes, who all collapse at the same time despite standing side by side, several feet apart.

If you can look past those flaws, this is still a fun movie, and while most of the film is relatively light and breezy considering the heavy subject matter, it is extremely violent and occasionally very bleak.  Bearing that in mind, it is still recommended.

As with many of Sammo's great titles, this is a Golden Harvest production, remastered and released by 20th Century Fox, with a terrific widescreen picture and no special features, except a few cool trailers.  Languages available in an English dub or Cantonese, with or without English subtitles.

901182,5,6304558422,"This movie is awesome.  It's a total throw back to 80s Vietnam war movies.  This movie takes place after the Vietnam War though,  a group of Asian prisoners are sent in as commandos to take out an ammo supply left behind by American Forces when they pulled out of the country.

Leading the group is the awesome Mr. ""Lam Ching-ying "" known from the ""Mr. Vampire"" movies and the legendary ""Sammo Hung.""  Yuen Biao also tags along in his greatest role EVER! As a weird emo haired martial artist in the jungles of Vietnam.

The movie mixes in the classic martial arts action we've come to expect from Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao with some pretty cool gunfights.  This film is very reminiscent of the Rambo sequels.  You get that gritty 80s action feel with the melodrama turned up high.  The ending fight scene to this movie alone is worth the price.  Yuen Wah vs. Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung is a pleasure to watch.  It's brutal, fast, and easy on the eyes.

This movie deserves more recognition and like all of Sammo Hungs stuff, it's greatly underrated here in the West.",1309219200,2,1063,4.479166666666667

901184,1,6304558422,Although it has a couple of good actors the movie itself was very poorly done with a lot of work needed on the speech syncronization. The action was slow and unrealistic.,1125273600,,170,4.516129032258065
901185,4,6304558422,"While it's not flawless, this Fox DVD edition of EASTERN CONDORS is clearly the best we've ever seen of this 1987 Hong Kong action classic. Sammo Hung, the star and director, had graduated from old school kung fu films to contemporary stunt-filled action comedies with his Peking Opera classmates, Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, and then a new direction (minus Jackie) with his all-star action comedy, MILLIONAIRES' EXPRESS in 1986. EASTERN CONDORS borrows liberally from THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967) and THE DEER HUNTER (1978), while injecting massive doses of kung fu, acrobatics, gunfire, black humor and tragedy into its tale of Asian and Asian-American military prisoners (""the Condors"") sent on a dangerous mission into Vietnam in 1976, a year after the American withdrawal.

The Condors' mission in Vietnam is to find and destroy an underground cache of American weapons to keep it out of Vietnamese hands. When they get to Vietnam they hook up with a trio of female Cambodian guerrillas (led by fighting femme Joyce Godenzi) who act as guides, but have an ulterior motive of their own. The group also picks up a local Cantonese-speaking black market dealer who's expert in kung fu (Yuen Biao). Thanks to a spy in the group, the Vietnamese army follows the Condors' every move.

The nonstop action is quite cleverly staged, although some of it is a bit far-fetched. The characters and their relationships are generally quite interesting and we tend to feel sadness and grief when a member of the group dies (or is seriously wounded or maimed). Partly filmed in Canada, with outdoors action shot in the Philippines, the film offers a spectacular climax staged in an underground weapons complex designed and built to resemble the sets Ken Adam built for so many James Bond films.

The film's expert cinematography is finally given a transfer that allows us to appreciate it in widescreen with 16:9 enhancement. However, both the English-dubbed and Cantonese language tracks are slightly but noticeably out of sync. The English dub is pretty awful. The subtitles for the Cantonese track are not the original ones we saw in earlier editions of the film. They're ""dub-titles,"" transcriptions of the English dub dialogue which is far less interesting and dramatic than accurate translations of the original dialogue. So don't discard your earlier copies.",1106784000,10,2345,5.1015625
901186,5,6304558422,"Sammo Hung perfects the term ""non-stop action"" in this ...kicking, fire fighting, tree climbing, knife wielding adventure based on ""The Dirty Dozen"".  Sammo and Yuen Biao demonstrate what skill is all about and manage to amaze without using a wire.  Jackie Chan is the man, but his two buddies from school reign supreme in this film that Jackie wishes he would have thought of first.",1052265600,,383,4.876923076923077
901187,5,6304558422,"As mentioned already, this film is loosely based on the classic American war film The Dirty Dozen, except there's only 10 (i think) individuals and it's a half martial arts (MA), half war movie. Sammo actually lost a lot of weight for this role and he and Yuen Biao were just awesome in this movie. The story is simple, the best prison inmates are given a chance to earn money and freedom should they accomplish a secret mission. They will not know anything about their mission or where they are going until they are at the goal. Sammo is one of the inmates alongside director Yuen Kwai and choreographer Yuen Wo Ping. The latter 2 provide some comedy to the film. The Dirty Pack soon realize that they're in Vietnam to destroy nuclear weapons that the Viet Cong have yet to know about. The premise here is if the Viet Cong find out about it, they'll use it. The rest of the film displays some really cool acrobatic warfare tactics. There is also shooting involved as expected in a war film. Yuen Biao and Sammo showcase some very awesome moves; I'm talking wicked and fast attacks. I must mention that this is the kind of film that builds up to be better; the beginning is not all that impressive, but later on into the movie is great MA. The end fight is as should be the best...wow and ouch...This must be seen because some of the greatest fighters are here doing some great stuff. Yuen Wah is the leader of the Viet Cong platoon out to get the Dirty Pack, and he shows some of his awesome kicking abilities, this guy is so agile and fast. The well known Thai-boxer Billy Chow (the superpowerful general from Fist of Legend) also has a part as once again a bad guy. He has an extremely brutal fight with Sammo that'll make you cringe. Chow and Wah are very highly overlooked. Biao does some crazy moves in the final fight as well...this just has to be seen...this last fight alone surpasses the worth of purchase. I only have 2 complaints: I wanted to see more, the fights here are all classic and awesome, but short. One hard hit and it was over...don't get me wrong, this looks very realistic, but I just wanted to see more of it. Also, Lam Ching Ying did not do any MA at all, and this guy is [amazing], you gotta see him in Prodigal Son. All in all, a very rare and classic HK martial arts/war film. The best version of dvd comes from the Hong Kong Legends distributors. You'll need an all-region dvd player to play their region 2 PAL dvds though, but they are known for remastering video and sound and providing awesome extras in their rereleased HK films. If you can't have the privelege of the dvd player, then stick with the Fox version above because the DTS track rocks. At least check this film out if you don't intend to buy, it's one of a kind. Check out my other MA reviews too, thanks for reading.",1041984000,9,2814,4.382409177820268
901188,5,6304558422,"If looking from the war side, I'd say go and rent Bullet in the Head (a great war movie by John Woo).  But if you want to see good fight scenes, this movie is for you.  One of Hung's best works, includes great appearances from Yuen Biao, Yuen Wah, and Dr. Haing S. Ngor.  However, I still don't understand why Joyce Godenzi was in it.  I bet because she was Hung's girlfriend.  Anyway, I think that the usual version is cut short because, after seeing an Asian preview, I noticed that there are supposedly more scenes in the American prison.  But despite all of these negative factors, the movie is just great to watch.  If you are a true fan of Asian cinema, you won't be dissapointed.",975110400,2,686,4.354330708661418
901189,4,6304558422,"Cool remake of ""The Dirty Dozen"". The plot follows a ragtag group of recruits on a mission to destroy a hidden weapons bunker. A fit looking Samo Hung stars and directs this nonstop action movie. Lots of Hong  Kong Cinema Superstars; Lam Ching Ying portrays the unit commander. Legend  Yuen Woo Ping (Martial Arts Director ""Matrix"") appears as part of  the crew. Dr. Haing S. Ngor, 1984 Best Supporting Actor winner for  ""The Killing Fields"", is rescued from a villiage and joins the  team enroute. Mercenary Yuen Biao is recruited at the same time. The guys  are paired up with a feminine trio of freedom fighters, including Samo's  real life wife Joyce Godenzi. Yuen Wah masters the role of the creepy bad  guy and gets to showcase his martial arts skills. Lots of gritty gunbattle  scenes and explosions. Superb stuntwork by most of the cast. Fight scenes  with some of the best martial arts actors ever. The scene with the young  boys directing the Russian Roulette game will haunt you. Samo makes very  creative use of the local flora in the jungle fight scene. He also uses  slow motion to showcase the moves of the lightning fast Yuen Biao. If you  like war movies you will want to own this one. I bought the English dubbed  version, but will also be purchasing the subtitled version.",961372800,,1291,4.6755555555555555

7874665,1,6304558422,"I'm disappointed in Amazon here, not the film. It's worthy of at least 4 stars. My issue is with this particular copy of the film. It has no music! I mean zero. I'd seen it before on DVD and it had music there, so I'm wondering who did this HD transfer and why Amazon decided it would be okay to let customers stream a version of the film that wasn't in keeping with the director's vision. Hopefully this will be corrected at some point because this movie deserves better.",1522540800,,472,4.314606741573034
7874666,4,6304558422,"Excellent fighting movie.  Somewhat more grounded in reality, being a war movie, not a period fantasy or comedy farce piece.  Every punch and kick looked like it hurt.  The athleticism of Sammo and Yuen is just ridiculous.  Especially Yuen Biao looks like he has a superhero level control of his body in even non fighting scenes.  The three women fighters absolutely kicked ass too.
Would have been even better without the comedy and over the top acting of the supporting commandos, but whatever.",1522281600,,496,4.927710843373494
