637584,5,6303369081,"I am probably one of the few who would give this 5 stars, but you see, that is because of the sentimentality and memories it brings to me.  Saw it soooo many years ago on tv, had forgotten about it, and like many others I've bought, couldn't resist when I saw it on Amazon.  Really nice family drama about people and a very special dog....very heartwarming.  Love it!",1358553600,3,367,4.367647058823529
637585,5,6303369081,Amazing movie and under rated.  I can't believe it's so hard to find.  Espeically with Carroll O'Connor (aka Archie Bunker) playing a big role in it and doing a great job like the rest of the actors lol.  Any fan of dogs and good classic movies will like this one.  It's also in color and the quality is great.,1357257600,,310,4.203389830508475
637586,5,6303369081,"Although not nearly as good as the book, it was amazing to see the book that I loved for so long come to life. Of course, this movie is a bit old, but it made no difference in the experience. The story was great, the emotions real, and the dogs ever-so cute. I highly, highly recommend this movie to children or anyone who loves dogs",1192838400,,333,4.138461538461539
637587,5,6303369081,"I MUST HAVE MISSED SEEING THIS FILM AS A CHILD. I AM SO GLAD I FOUND IT ON VHS AND WAS ABLE TO VIEW IT NOW. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST HEART WARMING FILMS I HAVE SEEN. I DID ENJOY ALL THE LASSIE MOVIES BUT. ""LAD,A DOG"". TOUCHED MY HEART EVEN MORE.THE SETTING OF THE FILM IS BEAUTIFUL ALONG WITH THE LOVELY MUSICAL SCORE THIS FILM REALLY TUGS AT THE HEART STRINGS. THE CAST IS WONDERFUL, WITH THE HANDSOME ACTOR PETER BRECK,FROM, ""BIG VALLEY"". FAME,PLAYING THE HUSBAND AND THE TALENTED, PEGGY MCCAY, FROM, ""DAYS OF OUR LIVES"", FAME, PLAYING THE WIFE.LITTLE ANGELA CARTWRIGHT, FROM, ""MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY"" AND ""LOST IN SPACE"", GIVES A TOUCHING PERFORMANCE AS THE YOUNG GIRL WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH,LAD. WE EVEN HAVE CARROLL O' CONNOR HERE, FROM ""ALL IN THE FAMILY"" FAME, AS THE FATHER OF THE LITTLE GIRL THE STRONG CAST HELPS TO MAKE THE MOVIE SPECIAL I CAN'T FORGET THE BEAUTIFUL COLLIE WHO PLAYS, LAD. WHAT A GORGEOUS DOG. ALL IN ALL, I GIVE THIS FILM A VERY HIGH RATING. I HOPE THAT WARNER BROTHERS WILL PUT IT OUT ON DVD VERY SOON.SIT BACK AND ENJOY A FILM OF SHEER ENCHANTMENT AND ENJOYMENT FOR ALL AGES.",1167264000,,1102,4.380487804878049
637588,5,6303369081,"As usual, HollyWood spiced it for the screen, but the original book, and others about collies by Albert Payson Terhune, need no spicing. Lassie is still classic, but Lad is beleivable and more straightforward. Read the books that started the legend of Lad and you will be even more impressed. The dog's reaction to his mistress's (the master's wife) illness is truly a wonder in dog behavior. Also, if you are a dog lover and lover of dog stories, Jim Kjelgaard's Big Red, plus other stories about Irish Setters (Irish Red, Outlaw Red) are on a level with Lad. Maybe better. Read a Book! Then watch the movies.",1127692800,5,610,4.657407407407407
637589,5,6303369081,"This is one of those movies from childhood, I actually had one, that you never forget.  Angela Cartwright plays a handicapped little girl who finds love, understanding and healing in her families beloved Collie.  Why this movie hasn't made it do DVD yet, I can't imagine.

It is a wholesome family film that people of all ages can enjoy.  The movie does have some serious and heavy moments as well.  If the man who burns the family barn down doesn't convince you that evil exists, nothing will. ""Lad, A Dog"" will bring laughter and tears and I will continue to hope for a proper Widescreen DVD release if Warner will dig it out of its vault.  Enjoy the VHS in the meanwhile! Best Wishes, CAL",1035936000,8,691,4.488
637590,5,6303369081,"I saw this one at the very young age of nine and it remains one of the best dog lover's films of all time.  Angela Cartwright, later to star on ""Lost in Space"" and on the big screen as one of the Von Trapp children in ""The Sound of Music,"" is quite effective as the crippled child who is ""healed"" by the love she has for a canine.  Peter Breck, Peggy McCay, and Carroll O'Connor are very good as the principal adults.
Be warned, however.  Get out the box of tissue during the aftermath of the fire.  Not since the death of ""Ole' Yeller"" has their been a more poignant scene.",969667200,19,574,4.1441441441441444
637591,5,6303369081,"I HAVE ENJOYED THE MOVIE LAD A DOG IMMENSELY. COULD YOU HAVE FOUND A BETTER ACTRESS (CHILD) THAN ANGELA CARTWRIGHT--SHE PLAYS THE PART BEAUTIFULLY. ELIZABETH TAYLOR GREW TO LOVE COLLIES THROUGH HER ROLES IN THE  EARLY LASSIE MOVIES. BUT  I FEEL THAT LAD A DOG IS A BETTER MOVIE THAN ANY  OF THE LASSIE MOVIES.  FIRST THE SETTING IS WONDROUS AND PEGGY MCCAY AND  PETER BRECK PLAY THEIR PARTS SO WONDERFULLY.  THE WRITER HAS CAPTURED THE  TRUE ESSENCE OF BEING AN ARTIST. TREMAYNE IS A WRITER--THEIR HOME &  GROUNDS ARE WONDROUS, BUT YOU ARE LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT TO BE A  GOOD WRITER, DOES NOT EXACTLY INCUR WEALTH. STEPHEN & ELIZABETH  TREMAYNE ARE NOT AS  WEALTHY AS GLURE, BUT THE SEEM TO HAVE A RICHNESS IN  CHARACTER AND IN ART THAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS. THE DOG THAT WAS USED IN THE  MOVIE--HOW GORGEOUS--BRAINS & BEAUTY DO GO HAND IN HAND! ALL OF THE  SCENES ARE SO NATURAL--HOW COULD A DOG PERFORM SO  WONDERFULLY IN A MOVIE  SETTING. HE PLAYS THE PART SO GRACIOUSLY. THE TRI COLOR IN THE MOVIE IS  ANOTHER ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL DOG--IF YOU LOVE THE  COLLIE, THIS MOVIE IS  FOR YOU.  A TRUE APPRECIATION OF THE COLLIE--IN FANCIER'S TERMS FOR  FANCIERS, ARTISTRY FOR THE SENSES, INTELLECT, AND IMAGINATION, AND FOR  THOSE WHO APPRECIATE INTELLIGENCE IN THE COLLIE--THIS ONE IS FOR YOU. I  FEEL THAT EVERY CHILD AND ADULT SHOULD VIEW THIS MOVIE--IT IS TRULY A  CLASSIC.",940809600,17,1380,4.654166666666667

637705,5,6303369081,"Great family movie. Sure, it is improbable, but this is a feel good movie with a great dog. I remember seeing this as a kid and thought Carroll O'Conner was the world's biggest creep. Seeing it as an adult, I think maybe not. Anyway, if you want to go to bed smiling, this is the film to watch. In fact, every couple months for the last few years, I have checked over again and again. And Lad finally came out on dvd. Can't miss with this one.",1447372800,3,443,4.103448275862069
637706,5,6303369081,"This is a great movie with great actors , the dogs are beautiful, I saw this movie when I was very young and I fell in love with  the collie dog, I even owned one.  My dog was as beautiful and great as these dogs in the movie.",1446076800,2,226,3.6875

637708,5,6303369081,This timeless Lad movie will be a great addition to my Albert Payson Terhune and Lassie collection.  I really enjoyed watching it on my own DVD after it had been awhile since I had watched years ago on TV.,1441843200,,205,4.256410256410256
637709,5,6303369081,"First of all, I absolutely LOVE Albert Payson Terhune's books about his wonderful collies.  I have searched for a DVD copy of this for a very long time - was told it was not available and bought several copies from an auction site that were poorly made copies of degraded VHS tapes.  Got this one and it is beautifully clear, with good sound.  Some may feel the story is a bit schmaltzy and old-fashioned, but the collies are gorgeous and ""The Place"" (as Sunnybank, Mr. Terhune's home was called in the stories) is as beautiful as it is described in the books.  If you liked ""Lassie"", then you will probably like this - and you can let your kids watch without worrying about foul language - though there is a somewhat disturbing scene of collies trapped in a burning barn, so I would be careful about showing this to smaller children.",1440979200,3,834,4.503311258278146

7845275,5,6303369081,"If you loved the Terhune books as much as I did growing up, this is a must have DVD. Of course it could not be filmed at the real Sunnybank where Mrs. Terhune still lived. The house and kennel were torn down a few years later and the ground were turned into a park. The famous dogs' graves are all still there. I was trying to figure out where the house had once stood and I had the The Book of Sunnybank with the Margaret Bourke White photographs. I came up Lad's grave and remembered he was buried at the edge of the veranda and I knew where the house once stood.",1495584000,2,565,4.053571428571429
