8166938,5,B000M7XRA6,"Exactly what I ordered two movies, in one did case that was delivered in an enveloped line with little plastic bubbles filled with tiny amounts of air to ensure my packages' journey through Mail Land is safe while providing added amusement as me and my children pop those little pop-its. The movies were as good as I remember (semi-dark and lined with undertones of very sad subjects. Little more sad now that I can grasp them a little more...). Pretty sweet soundtrackson each as well.

8166939,5,B000M7XRA6,"FERNGULLY: This is highly entertaining for both Children and the Child in Adults. Classic Robin Williams lines that are thankfully over most children's heads. I never laughed so hard.. It is a KEEPER and should be in your collection of ""GO TO"" Movies.

ALL GOOD DOGS GO TO HEAVEN: A wonderful family movie. The story is warm, but sad because the main character dies in the end. It touching and heart felt. If you are not ready to explain ""Death"" to your SMALL child, this is not one you should let them watch.",1424995200,,509,4.473118279569892
