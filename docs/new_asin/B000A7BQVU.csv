2377610,5,B000A7BQVU,"In 2004, the Student Body Council at Utah Valley State College (UVSC) decided to invite Michael Moore to their campus to speak. It was, after all, an election year, and in view of the recently released film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" Moore seemed to be an appropriate and timely choice. Moore's $40,000 speaker's fee would be easily offset by ticket sales. Simple, right? ... Well, think again. Moore's invitation to speak at UVSC sparked an incredibly ugly chain of events chronicled by the perceptive eye of first time filmmaker, Steven Greenstreet.

Greenstreet recorded events as the situation at UVSC became ugly. Student petitions circulated, demonstrations took place, and local Mormon, Kay Anderson, pulled out all the stops to achieve his goal of canceling Moore's engagement. Anderson felt that Moore did not represent the values of his community, and he was right about that. In a state where the population is 75% Mormon, and Republicans outnumber Democrats at the rate of 12:1, Moore's opinions don't exactly mesh with the majority. Few people, however will go quite as far as Anderson--offering a $25,000 cheque to cancel Moore and eventually sinking to suing the Student Body.

Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity is invited to UVSC in an attempt to help 'balance' the situation. Hannity's engagement was supposedly 'free', but since he demanded a private jet, his speaking engagement (which was paid for by the college) cost several thousands more than Moore's--an irony that seems to escape those who protested the money spent on Michael Moore.

""The Divided State"" is a microcosm for politics in America--and while it's not quite this ugly in most towns, America is politically--a divided nation. In Orem, Utah with the imminent visit from Moore, the moral divide of politics became extreme. First Amendment rights were severely threatened when self-appointed Dodge City Marshals of Morality tried to block Moore's visit just because they didn't like what he had to say. The documentary captures the emotionally charged atmosphere on campus as sides clash. Those who fight for Moore's presence see it as a battle for First Amendment rights--while those who are opposed to Moore argue that his presence brings ""hatred and filth."" As emotions are unleashed and tempers flare, courageous professors try to speak while the crowd heckles and boos, and radio host Sean Hannity humiliates a young man who had the courage to admit he was a liberal--well so much for Free Speech. And throughout this entire, shameful mess Student Body President Jim Bassi and Vice President Joe Vogel (both former Mormon missionaries) valiantly attempt to maintain their equilibrium in the volatile situation on campus.

""This Divided State"" is highly entertaining and yet also profoundly disturbing. Watching the events in Orem, Utah is a good reminder for everyone that we cannot allow others to make moral judgments about what we can see, hear, or read, and while a war rages in Iraq to supposedly create democracy in that nation, perhaps we should worry a bit more about what's taking place under our noses. The DVD offers extensive extras--interviews and deleted scenes, ""The Resignation"", Kay Anderson 'uncut', additional coverage of Michael Moore, a music video, and audio commentary--displacedhuman",1135468800,64,3294,5.256653992395437
2377611,4,B000A7BQVU,"This documentary is far more interesting than I had expected, and I hope that it becomes more widely known.  It concerns the controversy when Utah Valley State College in Orem, Utah (""the most conservative county in the most conservative state,"" according to a local right-wing activist) invited Michael Moore to speak shortly before the 2004 election.  All hell then breaks loose, as local right-wingers commence to: (1) attempt to bribe the college with tens of thousands of dollars to disinvite Moore, (2) initiate personal lawsuits against the student leaders, and (3) make personal threats against these leaders.  Sean Hannity then puts in an appearance, offering to waive his speaker's fee, even though he insists on travel fees with his private jet that approximate Moore's fee.

In the process, we see the clash of students on campus, a fascinating and terrifying glimpse of the malevolent heart of red-state ideology.  While parroting talk of ""freedom,"" these people have no qualms about making threats and ruining people personally for attempting to exercise these rights.  I think that most informed conservatives-- or at least those known to and accountable to the public-- would accord respect to our First Amendment rights.  However, this film gives us a glimpse of the base on which conservative power rests, and the view is not pretty.

The footage of Hannity's appearance is instructive.  Hannity apparently fancies himself some sort of strong-jawed ubermensch, strutting across the stage and demanding ideological conformity from his audience.  One young liberal is called out and ridiculed, all in the name of good fun.  UVSC professors put in appearances, raising valid points about the Iraq war, but are universally booed, shouted down, and even mooned by the volk in Hannity's audience.  Hannity's only response to their concerns: ""9/11 changed everything.""  As if, by repeating this uninformative mantra enough, they can will it into truth and achieve carte blanche power for the GOP.  One begins to understand how the Nazis came to power.

Moore's speech is interesting insofar as how it compares to Hannity's.  The passion of the persecuted Utah liberals really comes across, and the atmosphere is far more free and alive than the Hannity rally (even though two Naders supporters are shunted outside by security guards when they try to outshout Mike).

This film makes one see how absolutely essential our First Amendment freedoms are, but also raises a frightening specter: if the red sea grows, and the people no longer believe in the power of these rights, then they may become mere words on paper and cease to exist.  Indeed, a UVSC student representative is forced to resign, and the school loses hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations as a result of the Moore appearance.  Freedom of speech is not, in fact, free.",1134432000,11,2851,5.145336225596529

2377613,5,B000A7BQVU,"A fascin-ating view into totalitarian reality. The Sean Hannity speech was eerily similar to the Pink Floyd movie which demonstrated the dangers of totalitarianism, when he shines the spotlight on liberals to be subject to bullying by the speaker after gathering 8,000 Bush supporters.  Just as from the Floyd movie ..'Are there any (liberals) in the theater tonight? Get em up against the wall!  Theres one in the spotlight, he doesen't look right to me, have HIM up against the wall.

2377614,4,B000A7BQVU,"What an amazing documentary, and what a sad time for the country, let alone the state of Utah, and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons).

THIS DIVIDED STATE is not about Michael Moore and Sean Hannity. It is not about the 2004 election or the candidates. Neither is this film about republicans and democrats, or their values or ideologies...or even religion.

THIS DIVIDED STATE is about intolerance, close-mindedness, and the pride in our nation. It is an examination of freedom of speech and the power majority influence has upon this sacred amendment. It is about our desire as a people to be placated by the world around us, wishing nothing more than to not have the boat rocked while life goes on in piece.

It is about the critical need for honestly examining our belief systems and political views...if only to ensure that we know and understand them, for only then can we support them and affect change.

It is a cautionary tale about blindness, and the dangers this brings upon us as a people, nation, and global community. This is the evil in the film...not republicans or democrats, but the unwillingness to listen, the unwillingness to critically examine core issues, and the danger of assuming you are right without civil discourse.

Is THIS DIVIDED STATE unbiased? Of course not. The film makers clearly believe that freedom of speech is in critical danger, and is most certainly not a freedom in institutes of higher learning or a true freedom under the oppressive power of the majority.

The short comings in the film are merely the result of a narrative that could have been strengthened if pre-production had been possible. As it stands, this incident erupted around the film makers and they struggled to capture as much as possible as it unfolded, accomplishing this quite well.

The only other detractor was numerous occasional black frames during interviews and segments that may either be the result of edits or equipment. Which is unclear, but it is a bit distracting.

THIS DIVIDED STATE is a powerful documentary both poignant and incendiary...and most certainly pertinent to this day, in this nation...and indeed to all the world.",1128470400,11,2188,4.9427792915531334

It's that vital.  Go ahead and laugh at me, yeah... I'm the first and only reviewer here right now... keep laughing... I've made quite a few predictions in the past and none of you follower twits are laughing anymore because they came to fruition.  I eat ""nay-sayers"" alive... watch what happens here as well.

This documentary takes an unflinching look at American extremism on both sides of the fence and TRULY lets the viewer see these idiots for what they really are... blind ideologues. If you'd like to get an entertaining and exciting pulse on American political extremism in modern America...  this is your coaster ride.

This DVD will eventually be a huge, cultural hit. - This is your fate, the cow has spoken.

2377618,5,B000A7BQVU,"This is a fascinating little bit of sociology. Not a ""perfect"" film, but worth 5 Stars for the subject matter and nature of the participants. It's not unlike what you see in snippets on the nightly news, except that taken as a whole you get a pretty complete tapestry. While one senses to ""what side"" the filmmakers might lean, there is certainly plenty of time in the film given to all sides. In fact, the ""anti-Moore"" side probably dominates. And yes, it's overall effect is to cause one to wonder just what are these people basically afraid of? The

Hannity-Moore speeches (assuming that's what they were) might dominate the last half, but the real people of the film, mainly students,  are peppered throughout. Especially ""creepy"" is the deep pockets local resident who will go to any ends to stop Moore's appearance. But he has the merit of coming right out and saying he considers Moore to be ""anti-american"". Unlike the anti-Moore student petition drive, based on a phoney ""misuse of campus funds"" argument.

But perhaps the most perceptive remarks in the whole film come from the student, a conservative, who makes the point, briefly and eloquently, of the ""irony"" (hypocrisy) that the Mormon church sends out every year thousands of young people on missions to numerous foreign cultures. And all that these young people ask is that the residents be ""tolerant"" enough to listen to their message. Yet, it is in Orem, in the heart of Utah, that such tolerance is being refused to another American. (he says it better than I have here).

One often hears Bush is the ""boy in the bubble"" in Washington. This film demonstrates that there are a lot of people in Utah who want the state to be ""in the bubble"". But, as Moore himself says, Utah is a part of the nation. For better or for worse.

In short, this is a film well worth purchasing, viewing and passing around. It does get to the very core of what we need to fear as this country drifts into extreme polarization and the subsequent intolerance of other viewpoints. Perhaps not as extreme as in Utah, but when one hears Sean Hannity proclaiming himself an ideological Son of Utah, one wonders. The kind of film I'd love to see shown in high school classrooms everywhere. But I'm sure it wouldn't be allowed. Try your home instead.",1179014400,8,2288,4.695760598503741
2377619,5,B000A7BQVU,"The 5 stars I gave this movie were not based on any sort of great movie effects or high production costs; it was simply based on the real concept of the movie and the look at how real people act in controversial situations.  The maker of this documentary dropped out of Brigham Young University to create this documentary.  He was simply a University student aspiring to be a documentary film maker - I would say to him - well done.

This movie was shot in 2004 in the lead up to the US Presidential elections.  Michael Moore, a documentary filmmaker and author was invited by the student body of a State University in Utah to speak.  This created a lot of anger and controversy in the University.  Many people believed that Moore was going to somehow corrupt the students in the University.  Than, This Divided State gets into the concept of free speech and how we as Americans are lucky that we have it.  However, there are many people who believe free speech should be curbed and limits should be placed on it.  There are two main people who head the campaign to not bring Moore to their campus - one is a student who hands out petitions and debates passionately another one is some sort of a religious leader who lives nearby the campus.  There is a serious discussion over whether Moore should be allowed to speak or not.  The students against Moore disagree with his views and use the excuse that the State should not be paying him speaker fees - even though for any type of speaker, fees are common. It is decided to ""balance"" Moore's views; Sean Hannity will also come to the campus and speak the day before.

Sean Hannity has a show on Fox News called ""Hannity and Colmes"" he also has a radio program.  Hannity comes and speaks about liberals the same way African Americans were spoken about in public 50+ years ago.  He makes statements such as

""We would like liberals to live in our neighborhood - if they can afford it""

""He told a lie, typical liberal""

Hannity seemed like a very angry, hateful and one sided person.  He also made some references toward Professors who asked valid questions -such as there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The interesting thing is, any tax paying American citizen would want to know this information but for some reason, the auditorium full of people watching Sean Hannity tells the Professors to ""shut up"".  Hannity states ""maybe the Professors should go to Berkeley"".

Michael Moore comes the following day. There is a huge protest outside.  Moore's speech is very touching. The scene where he thanks American soldiers is enough to make anyone teary eyed.

The student body of the University, who invited Moore, gets numerous threats, even lawsuits.  The leader against bringing Moore to the campus also receives hate mail.  The worst part about this documentary is the ending.  To make you get a feel for the ending ,think of the movie, Lord of War.  In the movie Lord of War, Nicholas Cage says there is the quote ""Evil Triumphs When Good People Do Nothing. That quote is not true, the truth is that Evil Always Triumphs"".",1168041600,18,3086,4.61651376146789
2377620,5,B000A7BQVU,"I don't normally write reviews, but I see many off-topic, unhelpful reviews on this Amazon page, so I thought I should add my two-cents.

First, you should understand that this is a movie about Utah, not America at large. Perhaps Utah is similar to other conservative communities in America, but I would not extrapolate from this movie a portrait of America. Utah is a unique place -- anyone who has lived there can tell you. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone interested at all in Utah. I found the movie gripping and overall well-done. The whole turn-of-events surrounding Michael Moore's visit to Utah in 2004 is fascinating. The extras are just as interesting as the movie itself. As soon as I saw this movie, I bought copies for all of my friends and relatives in Utah.

This Divided State is not without its flaws -- there are ""soft"" spots in the film where filler material distracts/detracts from the main storyline -- but nevertheless I highly recommend this movie to anyone from Utah or interested in Utah. I don't know of any other movie that captures Utah as well as this movie does.",1167955200,11,1101,4.699481865284974
2377621,1,B000A7BQVU,"There's a scene in this slanted and dull documentary that sums up the film's lack of objectivity: a weirdly agitated and creepy Utah Valley State College (UVSC) Professor Caldiero spits out during a histrionic rant, ""There's no such thing as an objective view point. We all see things through filters!""  This Divided State was shot through a liberal filter that lionized filmmaker Michael Moore and sought to paint the conservative audience to which he spoke as a lot more bigoted and hostile than reality seemed to bear.  A lot of attention is paid to a few odd nutjobs like Kay Anderson, a self-appointed community spokesperson who seemed to have too much time on his hands, and too much faith in half-baked ideas of compelling the school and student body to drop Moore as a means to protect the community's conservative ideology.

A compelling case isn't made by an errant few, however, and the film's climactic scenes of Moore speaking show he is actually warmly- or at the very least, respectfully- received by the majority of the audience.  Conservative speakers like William Kristol, Pat Buchanan, and David Horowitz, or members of the Bush administration, would be grateful for a fraction of the consideration and deference on college campuses that Moore was met with in this alleged lion's den.  The real story of intolerance at higher institutions of learning is much better told vis-a-vis right-wing speakers at liberal institutions, often hit with pies, threatened with physical violence, or shouted down to the point where actual discourse is impossible.

With a few exceptions, the drama of yawner This Divided State is a figment of the filmmakers' editing.  There simply wasn't that much of a story: Sean Hannity gave a lousy speech on campus two weeks earlier than Moore and inappropriately mocked a Liberal audience member; ill-informed conservative students try to get signatures on a petition to prevent student funds from being used to attract Moore; student body president is under pressure from conservative community.  Yawn...  As if to prove the point of how little actually transpired during the events depicted in the documentary, an inordinate amount of time is spent on novelties like a student who looks like Michael Moore, a Utah resident named Michael Moore, and a campus pizzeria named ""Moore Pizza.""  When they're reaching in the barrel this deeply, you know the story (or at least its presentation) leaves something to be desired.",1161129600,5,2464,5.106965174129353
2377622,1,B000A7BQVU,"Michael Moore had no problem showing his anti-American movie in theaters, but when a movie was to be shown that refuted his movie, and showed what a liar he is, they threatened to sue, or boycott, etc.  It seems the only time they want free speech is when it suits them.

2377624,1,B000A7BQVU,"I recently had a chance to see the documentary, ""The Divided State,"" which I thought, perhaps more than any other film, reflects the political left's method of dealing with their adversaries. The practice amounts to propping up a straw man and setting him on fire. Many conservatives are personally familiar with this approach after discovering that, unbeknownst to them, their desire for decreased taxation or a privatized Post Office is a result of their latent religious fundamentalism, homophobia, and hatred for all living things.

In this documentary, the action stems from Michael Moore's planned visit to Utah before the 2004 election. His was invited there by the student council of Utah Valley State, and  the local Mormons who attempt to prevent him from speaking are the plot's straw men. Rather than do the logical thing, which would be to let Moore gibber, and then dissect his positions via rebuttal, they attempt to censor him. Their stance was unquestionably wrong; however, despite the fact that Mormons are often politically conservative, their act of intolerance has far more in common with the tactics of the left than those of the right.

Ironically, it is the improperly named ""liberals"" who embody repression and restriction  in our nation today. The movements of radical feminism, socialism, and multiculturalism have-with the aide of their enforcer, political correctness-diminished our pride, created a war between the sexes, wrongly distorted history, undermined the value of public education, and shamed us into financing a federal government big and powerful enough to take away our every need or aspiration.

An important question to ask here is why are there so many ""liberal"" professors? The answer is simple; they refuse to hire anyone who thinks differently from them. They can tolerate no disagreement or diversity on campus. If they did, none of their positions would be tenable. America is only a racist and sexist state when one refuses to examine anywhere else. As far as human beings go, we, as a people, are the most generous and kind on the planet. Yet, political correctness instructs that every white person has the heart of Bull Connor and that every man lords over women as if he were the Sultan of Brunei. These lies, rather than racism, are the true beliefs institutionalized in the system. Political correctness is the height of anti-intellectualism and is an excellent illustration of why a college education has little more value today than helping one to procure one a job. Our professors, supposedly great lovers of the masses, impoverish and bankrupt those they know best, students, as tuition costs irrationally escalate each year.

Excellent examples of illiberal liberalism can be found on our college campuses everyday. Here, the professors of Utah Valley State uniformly support Moore's views and passionately depict this fabulously rich and thriving millionaire as a modern day Lenny Bruce. Their self-righteous stances and emotations are vigorously recorded by the camera, yet their conformity merely serves to highlight the hold the political left has upon higher education. A politicized professorate is a worthless professorate. The current dispensation instructs young men and women that they live in a patriarchal apartheid state even though their instructors' state financed existence indicates just how wildly tolerant our country actually is. Only in our universities is social justice, the notion of citizens keeping what they earn, revamped into being an act of governmental policy favoring one group of citizens over another. There, the solution to every problem is more government spending and government's increased grip upon the economy. ""The Divided State"" does raise some important questions, but they surely are not the ones the film intended.",1147219200,4,3822,5.319536423841059

I am terrified of what things lay in store for us just a little further down the road into the 21st century! The reason I'm so terrified is that after seeing for ourselves how rabid hate mongering, anti-intellectualism, scapegoating of segments of populations, suppression of free speech & free expression, and religious fanaticism have led to such horrors as German National Socialism (Nazism), Japanese Imperialism, so-called ""Islamic Theocracies,"" and racial segregation/apartheid, that such huge portions of these United States of America would so readily ignore the lessons of the recent past and so willingly allow themselves to be stripped of the very freedoms & protections guaranteed by our nation's Constitution just so they can fulfill some primal animalistic desire to spew venom at anyone their collective ""groupthink"" mentality gives them permission to lash out against, regardless of the fact that oftentimes the very people they express their rabid vitriol towards have nothing but the most honorable of intentions for ""the common good."" It's this same type of fanaticism which is threatening to transform the ""democratic republic"" of the United States of America into a fascist police state on such a grand scale that would make Hitler, Stalin and Chairman Mao proud.

The evil mentality that is sweeping across this of all countries on planet Earth is encapsulated most effectively in the independent documentary, ""THIS DIVIDED STATE."" Watching the events that were recorded in the town of Orem, Utah after it was announced that the Utah Valley State College student government had invited filmmaker-- and outspoken G.W. Bush critic --Michael Moore to speak at their campus was like watching any number of the documented Hitler rallies we've all seen on PBS or the History Channel. The unthinking criticism of a critic (Moore) in an environment (college) that emphasizes 'critical thinking,' 'examination' and 'fact checking' as the basis for formulating & promoting an argument/opinion reeked of the 'Hitlerian' to such a degree that I was almost expecting to see fist fights spontaneously breaking out all across the campus at any time. (One student with one of his arms in a cast was indeed asked if he wanted to have his other arm broken also.)

The most telling part of the documentary is when local resident Kay Anderson's one-man crusade sought to literally ""purchase"" the suppression of ""free speech,"" using the circular argument that since Orem, Utah was a strongly ""Conservative"" community, Michael Moore and his views were not welcome there -- an attitude which caused one of the college professors to counter (paraphrasing): 'When they say Moore and his views are not welcome here, what they are really saying is that those of you may share Michael Moore's views, it is ""you"" and ""your views"" that are not welcome.' The most persuasive arguments (or rather, what 'should have been' persuasive arguments) in favor of allowing Moore to speak on campus were those presented by fellow LDS Church members (""Mormons"") who tried repeatedly to impress upon the minds of their more ""Conservative"" LDS brethren that their own religious history, as well as their global ministry, is tightly centered around the request for ""tolerance"" and ""freeness of speech"" -- especially when it involves the ""expressing of opposing points of view.""

Most sad and frightening, however, is the reaction of a stadium filled with mostly LDS-faithfuls (whose religion highlights ""peacefulness"" and ""morality"" as badges of honor) when, as a pre-visit counter to Michael Moore's arrival, Fox News staple Sean Hannity is invited to offer a little ""balance"" to the program (even though there were never any such outcries of needing ""balance"" when the college had invited numerous other ""Conservative"" speakers in the past, prior to the Michael Moore invite). Watching this scene was like watching a stadium full of people who had all taken a page right out of George Orwell's ""1984"" -- it was an extended version of the ""Two Minutes Hate"" being played out in the real world!

Contrasting Hannity's appearance with Moore's appearance a few days later, there were any number of glaring differences in style, substance and character worthy of note -- this one, in my opinion, was perhaps the most telling: When Sean Hannity fielded questions from self-described ""Liberals,"" he would humiliate them, name-call, belittle them, accuse them, and would either directly whip up his audience to launch angry verbal attacks against them or he'd simply stand back looking smug whenever the audience took such hate-filled initiatives on their own without any prompting from him; Whereas when Michael Moore called for the military veterans-- especially those who had served in this latest war in Iraq --to 'stand up and be recognized,' as it were, rather then launching into a ""How dare you support this illegal war!"" or some other such screed as ""Conservatives"" have been brainwashed to expect from ""America- & Military-Hating Liberals,"" Moore shouted out to them how much he and the rest of the audience ""thanked"" and ""appreciated"" them for their service to our country, but also that he & the audience felt a strong need to ""apologize"" to them for not having done more to keep the president from sending them into harm's way without just cause. (Makes one wonder, Who are the *REAL* ""America-Haters"" and haters of the ""Military""?)

Although the documentary focuses its attention on the State of Utah in general (and Orem City in particular), ""THIS DIVIDED STATE"" is as much an unflattering snapshot of the United States of America as a whole. Never before, since the Civil War years, has the nation been so divided, so polarized, and so ready to war against itself. But with the suppression of the one-time ""free and independent"" press, the 'stacking' of the judiciary, the emasculating (if you will) of a once strong & effectual ""opposition"" political party, the (mostly baseless) wide-eyed warnings of impending foreign attacks just looming over the horizon, and our being in control of the most awesome military might on the planet, America is on the fast track to becoming a fascist dictatorship with very little to stop its progress. Even prominent ""Conservatives"" have now begun speaking out (much too late) about the dangerous road the country is headed down -- now that they find themselves having to live with the very monster they themselves so enthusiastically helped to create before it grew beyond their control. The only thing that *MIGHT* be able to undo some of the damage would be for the very people and organizations (that were directly responsible for conditioning the minds of the unthinking sheeplike masses into the ""duckspeaking"" zombies they've become) to do a complete ""180,"" apologize to all the poor miserable souls who had become poisoned with & succumbed to their divisive & hurtful lies and propaganda, and to begin the process of retraining the people to start 'thinking on their own' again and to ""Question Authority"" about more than just the presence of a human stain on a blue dress.

Sadly, though, I have little hope for the future of this republic. So even in this age of ""We have always been at war with Eurasia/Eastasia (Iraq/Iran),"" ""Goldstein (Michael Moore) hates Oceania (America),"" and ""Big Brother (PATRIOT Act) is watching you (domestic surveillance)"" -- which Orwell missed by only two decades, the people themselves are not going to change, either out of fear or out of willful ignorance. But there is still some time left to commit the reality of the times to memory before it's all chucked down the ""memory hole,"" and ""THIS DIVIDED STATE"" is one of the best examples of where we are now as a country, and is a primer for what we need to be ready to face in the very near future.

2377626,5,B000A7BQVU,"This Divided State is a remarkable documentary: one that gives you all of the information on a topic, communicates the almost fetid emotions swirling around the issue - yet lays it out clinically and objectively.

And here's the bottom line: liberals will love it (and feel vindicated), conservatives will love it (and feel vindicated) and centrists will love it (and feel repelled watching the mounting polarization). And, we suspect, all of the key figures involved will feel they were fairly represented.

The context is the bitterly fought 2004 Bush-Kerry election and polarized America itself. Cut to Utah. Before the election day, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore is invited to speak at Utah Valley State College to balance an invitation that was made to have conservative talk show host Sean Hannity speak. Moore's invitation sparks a virtual firestorm among redstate-bluestate divided students and aggravates town-gown tensions...particularly when a well off homeowner veers the anti-Moore battle into new heights (or depths: choose your politically-packed adjective) by sparking allegations of bribery...and eventually even suing the pro-Moore student leaders.

Director Steven Greenstreet's incredible film clearly deserves even MORE awards than its 2005 Best Documentary Award at the Santa Cruz film festival. It's a rare film indeed that can be watched by people on the left, right and center and give EACH SIDE the sense that their perspective is well represented (a feat the commercial and cable networks often can't accomplish). But it's not just the political content: as a film, it's masterfully cut, well-paced and has zero padding. Every second advances the narrative. So This Divided State should be REQUIRED VIEWING for aspiring documentary makers and fans of documentaries everywhere.

Of special interest: chunks of Hannity and Moore's speeches are in this film. Those two segments are worth the price of the DVD ALONE - and they're not even the main thrust of this film.

Choose (depending on your view) the heroes and villains. The student association leaders? The well off homeowner who lives nearby and is almost frantic to stop Moore? So does ""free speech"" win? Does one side win? Or do they both win - and lose - in a seemingly winner-take-all grudge match? And DOES winner really take all? Or do the winners take little and the losers take little? Or in the end were the real winners polarizers Hannity and Moore who garnered tons of publicity for their future big buck appearances?

Sure, I'd probably work on the 3rd act a bit more for pacing reasons, but I'm really proud of how it turned out. I give it five stars. But I'm obviously biased.",1391472000,2,322,4.046875
8075418,5,B000A7BQVU,"The premise of this documentary is simple - Michael Moore, notorious outspoken liberal, is invited to speak at a university in Utah. This should be uncontroversial, after all, the First Amendment of the US Constitution explicitly protects freedom of speech and expression.

Not so for Kay Anderson, who would belong more at home at a Texas secession rally or a tea party convention than a university, which is, ostensibly, a bastion of higher learning and multiple viewpoints. Anderson goes so far as to sue the university for ""daring"" to invite someone like Moore, who does not share the ""moral fabric"" of his neighbourhood. At the time of the DVD's release, he has, fortunately, not sued the filmmakers.

While the film does not delve into specific liberal or conservative policies or philosophies in much detail, it does teach a vital lesson about gated communities walled off from the rest of the world, and how some individuals can almost effortlessly fall into the trap of tyranny by majority. After all, simple democracy is akin to two wolves and a sheep deciding on their evening meal. Needless to say, freedom is never free, but comes attached with eternal vigilance.

When Hannity comes to provide a ""balanced"" viewpoint in a state that is already highly Republican to the point that no Democrat would waste the time or effort campaigning for its electoral votes, the campus is, understandably, ecstatic and incredibly supportive. Hannity's callous behaviour in publicly shaming a liberal (who had the fortitude to make his affiliation known) seems to gloss over these rigid and anachronistic right-wingers. A similar farce occurred when college professors attempted to explain their position and why Moore should be permitted to speak. Whatever your political leanings, colleges are a part of the public domain, and as such, should not prohibit any individual or group from expressing their views at such venues.

Given the social policies of Republicans (and conservatives worldwide in general), it is hardly surprising that they would stoop to such tactics, given that they loathe freedom and individual choice when it comes to contraception, control over one's body, and recreational drugs.

The supplementary material is exemplary and emblematic of the diligence, dedication and commitment to free speech shown by the filmmakers. This is one documentary that should not be missed.",1365120000,2,2395,5.242819843342037
8075419,5,B000A7BQVU,"I came to this film late, but considering that at least two Mormon politicians are potentially in the running for the 2012 presidential election, it became synchronistically relevant.  As a person who likes to parse things out in a Libraesque fashion, trying to give both sides their due fair share, I was dismayed at the emotional reaction it elicited from me.  By the time I got to the scene with Hannity and the bullying of the ""liberals"" in the audience of mostly Morman conservatives, I was so disturbed that I had to bail out of the movie.  It is truly a shame that Mormans in general were represented in that way, and many must have been mortified and embarrassed by the behavior of their brethren.  I have not ever seen Hannity operate before, not being a TV watcher, and was looking forward to trying to get a more reasoned perspective about this guy, but all I can say is ""Wow"" . . . it's even worse than I thought.

I was hoping to get a better view of a religion that most non-Mormans don't understand.  Instead, what I saw was something that eerily mimicked what was done to Jesus, the symbol most revered by any Christian-based religion.  As a non-denominational believer in ""Something"" out there greater than us, one can only admire the story of a master like that, and so many Christian-based religions nowadays forget that homily ""What Would Jesus Do"" . . . or say . . . or teach?  He certainly would not have taught the merciless flaying of someone trying to challenge the powers that be.

Nor would the principles of democracy teach that.  I give this film 5 stars for showing a gritty rendition of the insanity that can occur when our main source of information becomes the lowest common denominator, i.e. plastic talk show hosts who earn enormous fees by parroting caricatures of belief systems for self-serving purposes, often admitting behind the scenes that they know better.  Heavy karma there . . .

Documentaries like this are inflammatory, and that's usually not the best way to get one's information.  But sometimes we all need a wake-up call, and this continues to be a major one.  As another reviewer said:  this film will be even bigger in the future.",1308787200,2,2183,4.6484375
8075420,5,B000A7BQVU,"This is an epic documentary of the events that took place at Utah Valley University during the 2004 presidential elections. Michael Moore was asked to come speak in the ultraconservative ""bubble"" of Utah County. It caused a major uproar that played out in the news across the nation. As a long time Utah County resident i can say that it was a riveting time, and I feel like this film showed the details accurately. It even gave an insider-perspective that showed the full story that not even the locals were privy to.

8075421,1,B000A7BQVU,"This is a misleading ""docupropaganda"" yes the people of Utah County and Utah in general responded a very narrow minded way.  Yes it was embarrassing.  Not only the way people responded here in Utah but the fact that the Nimrods at UVSC thought it would be a good idea and uncontroversial. A few people wanting to make a statement, I believe on purpose. ""When in Rome""... I am not personally fond of either man or in this case fools.  But I do know this John Huntsman provided the jet free of charge.  UVSC did not pay a dime for it.  And Hannity wanted to debate Moore, I would have to say Hannity won this one due to a coward (Moore) not having the facts or guts to stand up to a buffoon like Sean Hannity. Let's be fair make a documentary that tells evenly what happened.  After seeing this ""docupropaganda"" garbage I actually did some research and well I have a lot more respect for Sean Hannity.  If people keep drinking the koolaid on either side they will not have a voice because someone will always be speaking for them. God save us what a wast of money.

Look at how the wealthy ignoramuses in America get to impose their will on everyone else.  Look at the willfully ignorant anti-intellectual celebrities like Hannity jeering on the crowds to persecute the liberals.  It is all here.  Will it get worse?  Not if we get a few more Michael Moores to fight for the real America.

8075423,5,B000A7BQVU,"This movie shows blatantly the all importance of free speech and the panicky fear of the powerful for it.
Free speech can (and should) reveal inconvenient truths (the `real world'), and it could (should) effectively undermine the power base of vested interests. That is also the reason why those vested interests control nearly all media outlets.

In this movie, those in power (local business interests) were trying by ALL means to prevent a speech (only that!) at a college hall by a democrat (also Democrat), in the person of movie director and social agitator Michael Moore. They were afraid that he could influence public opinion (an overwhelming majority for the RP) and change the political majority and its agenda, although the chances were practically inexistent.

As Saint Augustine said: `Men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.'

This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.",1242864000,2,974,4.890909090909091
8075424,4,B000A7BQVU,"In 1844, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints (LDS) was murdered by religious bigots. His followers moved to Utah, where 75% of the state's population today subscribes to this belief. They are mostly republican, outnumbering democrats or liberals by twelve to one.

The Divided State brings us to 2004 where two members of the student government at the Utah Valley State College decided to invite Michael Moore to speak on campus before the November presidential election. The fees for Moore's visit would be $40,000 for which advanced ticket sales have already insured a profit. When the invitation was made, the uproar began.

Students opposed to the political views of the controversial filmmaker started drawing petitions to have the invitation rescinded. They never claimed that it was about Moore's politics, but how the money was spent. They have the support of Kay Anderson, a local businessman in the Oram, Utah community. Anderson seems to delight being in the spotlight even as students challenge his opposition, and catch him repeatedly contradicting himself. (A trailer to this shows the students lampooning him mercilessly, which draws chuckles from the man who gives every appearance of being a self-righteous bigot and hypocritical throwback to the 1950's). Students counter Anderson's argument by asking why it is so important keeping someone out, which is the same reason the LDS sought refuge by immigrating to Utah.

Conservative students invite ultraconservative Sean Hannity to speak at the school, days ahead of Moore. He agrees to do it free, just so long as they pay his expenses and the cost of flying by private jet. Cost: $50,000.

Watching Hannity was perhaps the most difficult viewing of this story. His patronization of the crowd and condescension was nauseating. He humiliated a liberal in the audience, and on stage while carefully keeping the microphone from him. He summoned other liberals by calling them, as he would call for a house pet. Moore follows several days later, also to a sell-out crowd, extolling the courage of the student body president, Jim Bassi and Vice President Joe Vogel, who find themselves in a lawsuit filed for spite by fellow Mormon, Kay Anderson.

This was surprisingly entertaining and powerful. It was shocking, and disgusting to see Kay Anderson completely contradict his Christian principles and American ideals, saying the community could ignore the first amendment rights of other Americans by keeping them from speaking in his town or local college. Knowing Hannity's routine, I have gained a new level of contempt for this conceited prima donna. Yet, it was refreshing to see college students remain ever mindful of their civic obligation to protect the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens.

This was a microcosm of division that has permeated across our land, hence the title, ""This Divided State.""  Another lesson to be learned from this is that civil rights can always be taken away or challenged by rationalization by anyone in the majority, liberal or conservative, and that tyranny can appear in the form of self-righteousness, misdirection, and under the cloak of patriotism.
