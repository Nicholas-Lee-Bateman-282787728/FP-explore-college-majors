1501746,5,B00005JN8Q,Amazing Stories was my most favorite T.V. show back in the day. I was just a wee lad but I knew this was a great show. It stirs the imagination and gives you flights of fancy as you dream. I think this series is a definite DVD seller. If you make it they will buy it!,1121817600,3,267,3.7857142857142856
1501747,5,B00005JN8Q,I was so disappointed that the set of Amazing stories that they show on the SciFi channel are not available on DVD.  I really hope they make them on DVD soon!  I'll be waiting...,1118534400,,178,4.205882352941177

It is beyond time for Amazing Stories to be on DVD, as I am sure all of you will agree. There are some fantastic, unique gems mingled throughout the series. I have yet to see a bad episode.

From Spielberg to Scorsese, many of the most powerful directors of our generation have contributed their guidance at the helm of many stories. My personal favorite would be hard to choose. Perhaps, ""A few more Dreamers"" starring Mark Hamill from Star Wars. Or maybe the Pilot episode directed by Spielberg starring Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Costner. Amazing Stories is a series which beams with originality, with a wink towards the impossible.

Hopefully, if our voices are heard, they will release (as they did with Shelly Duvall's Fiary Tale Theater) the entire saga in one release, rather than spanning it out over time. My biggest hope would be that it will be released before I have children; what could be a better gift to pass down than an incredible stir of the imagination??

(Good resources for dvd releases, which would most likely be first to report would be thedigitalbits.com or videoeta.com) ~SAOS~

The second one they sent me had some DVDs scratched as well. Im not sure why this is happening, but i kept my second set anyway and i will work through it.",1511481600,,275,4.0181818181818185
1501927,5,B00005JN8Q,"The ""MUMMY DADDY"" episode in this fine series is, alone, worth the price of admission. It is hysterically finny and brilliantly clever almost beyond description and the performances are  first-rate. It never fails to bring a huge smile to my face and great laughs  whenever it comes to mind. it  should have won an Oscar or at the very least been nominated.  Any  viewer who can't appreciate this brilliant marvel is very likely  already a mummy and has my sympathy for missing one of the important things in life.
Also worthy of mention  is an earlier episode in the series, ""THE MAIN ATTRACTION.""  It too is brilliant and very  funny but not quite up to the level of ""MUMMY DADDY"". Few things are!  Miss these at your own peril.

1501928,5,B00005JN8Q,"Ah, 1985, when I could still eat an extra large pizza, when games were fresh, when Star Wars was still kind of a new thing (ten years on), and 80s music from new wave to hard rock filled the air waves.

Another trend came to television, the ""Twilight Zone"" format, where a show told different stories with different characters every week.  And so it is that Steven Spielberg produced a really rocking TV series that told Twilight Zone like stories, but unlike Rod Serling's series (and it's 1980s reincarnation) ""Amazing Stories"" had fairly decent endings.  The characters didn't get screwed over like in so many of Serling's shows (that man must have been a pessimist).

Amazing Stories was and is truly great entertainment.  If you liked the Twilight Zone, if you liked The Outer Limits, if you liked Voyagers!, if you liked any of the tall-tale formats from the 1980s, then this show is for you.

And what's amazing to me is that even though Spielberg didn't direct (or so far as I know) each episode has his signature style in terms of editing and production values.  It's got that ultra-Hollywood gloss to it; i.e. pretty good production values (seriously, for a TV series no expense was spared) in terms of name list talent, stories, scripts and even John Williams scores this series with an almost E.T. like music with a lot of uplifting melodies and instruments.  It's that kind of a TV series.

Overall it's just a really charming TV series.  It's what happens when you let one of the greatest Hollywood talents have a crack at a weekly TV format, and let him do it his way.  You get this.

A real treasure.  I'm sorry they don't make these anymore.  Check out season 1 at the very least.  A good watch.

Enjoy.",1507420800,,1720,4.608552631578948
1501929,5,B00005JN8Q,"I can not say enough of this series. I just watched the HBO documentary on Spielberg and was reminded of this series. One of the funniest things I have, even to this day, seen on television was the episode ""Mummy Daddy."" Everyone of the episodes was so well written, pulled some of the best actors of the time, and some that would become more famous (Kevin Costner in ""The Mission""), and were so well directed because some of the best in the industry took up the helm including Spielberg himself. I am in no way putting down television today, but this series was just great television and I wish a channel or Netflix would run them and expose a new generation to quality television.",1507420800,,682,4.508064516129032

If there are any negatives to be had, is that the set is very light on special features except for a smattering of deleted/alternate scenes.

1502872,1,B00005JN8Q,"Amazingly overrated. The negative reviews of this show are accurate. The stories are trite and unimaginative, the endings are either obvious or simply fall flat, the acting is equally uninspired. As a kid I loved watching Twilight Zone in syndication in the 70s. I was excited when Amazing Stories was announced and, even as a kid, disgusted at how sub par it was, on its own terms but especially by comparison to the T-Zone. I re-watched an episode years later and my original assessment still holds true - poorly written, poorly executed. If you are in the mood for 80s TV horror/fantasy then Freddy's Nightmares and Friday THe 13th are better, though certainly less tame than Amazing Stories.",1404950400,,695,4.898305084745763

It gives you that deep down inside feeling of pleasure and I truly enjoyed it! You never get tired of it, and Steven Spielberg is well, simply put a genius! John Hughes my absolute favorite of all time! He had a way with words and conveyed that in his storytelling..he is sorely missed, a hard act to follow, and a blessing to have had him in our lifetime!",1329350400,3,587,4.157894736842105
1503143,5,B00005JN8Q,"It was no surprise that Steven Spielberg would be the guiding force behind this remarkable series from the mid-80's.  As the producer - and occasional director - Spielberg was able to saddle some of the top-notch directors of the day as well as veteran performers and up-and-comers.

The engaging and well-produced stories run the gamut from fantasy to science fiction to a mixture of them both.  Most of them are family friendly but two may not be suitable for all members of the family.

The two that fall into that category are ""The Incredible Falsworth"" and ""Mirror Mirror.""

In the former, Gregory Hines plays a club mind reader who during one of his performances gets an ""image"" of a serial killer amidst the member of his audience.  The story is tense and really raises the goosebumps.

""Mirror Mirror"" is equally as terrifying.  Sam Waterston (""Law & Order"") plays an author who is terrorized by a hooded killer that can only be seen through mirrors.  Waterston deserved an Emmy for his performance.

During their initial network airings, both episodes were proceeded by disclaimers for parents about their content.

The DVD fails to warn the buyers of this fact.

The book-like packaging is commendable and the only extras are 20 minutes worth of deleted scenes.",1329264000,3,1271,4.915492957746479
1503144,4,B00005JN8Q,"Back in the mid 80's I used to catch this show every so often when it was a weekly series. Steven Spielberg was the driving force behind this episodic show and you can tell he really put his all into it. This show really reminded me of the old Rod Serling shows which I love so much. This set includes every show from the first season which aired in 1985-1986 I believe.

Some of my favorite episodes include: Mummy Daddy, The Mission, The Amazing Falsworth, The Sitter, One For the Road, and hands down my favorite of the entire season, Dorothy And Ben. Selected episodes include deleted scenes from the original show, a nice touch. If you're at all a fan of shows such as The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Night Gallery etc, but with an updated 80's Spielberg twist then you will not be disappointed with this impressive show.

The packaging is simple but effective. A nice box with a synopsis for each show printed inside. For those of you waiting for Season Two to come out on DVD in the USA, don't hold your breath. Seems that Universal cancelled the DVD a while back although it seems to have come out as an import from Germany (In the PAL standard). From what I've read it was (is?) available via Netflix but don't hold me to it since I don't subscribe to that service.",1328659200,2,1279,4.415254237288136

1503247,4,B00005JN8Q,Good anthology series from the mid 80's.  The tales gear more towards fantasy and humor than suspense or horror but there are a few chillers among them.  This was released in 2006 and I just don't get why they haven't yet released the second season of a 2-season show. I've read its available in parts of europe and japan but no release date yet for U.S. region 1.,1297728000,,364,4.338235294117647
1503248,4,B00005JN8Q,"As I remember, Amazing Stories was on television on Monday nights opposite Monday Night Football.  This was the reason for its poor ratings and subsequent cancellation after only two years.  It never had a chance!  Most viewers never watched it at all, especially during fooball season.  There were at least two episodes that I remember distinctly that were not included in the posted listings of the episodes. I wonder what happened to them.  One was I believe titled 'The Card', telling the story of a woman harshly punished for running up a charge card.  The other involved a young couple who discovered old photographs of primative tribesmen, only to have the tribesmen come to life in their suburban home.  Both of these episodes were absolutely wonderful.  I'd sure like to be able to find copies of them.",1295395200,,811,4.868613138686132

1503333,4,B00005JN8Q,"Ah, Amazing Stories, how I remember you fondly! This DVD set contains the entire 1st season of the show (all 6 dvds worth!). It's presented with a nice little menu that plays the AS theme on a loop (warning: this gets old pretty fast). The box itself looks like a book, with the cover opening into a compartment that contains a smaller, more traditional multi-dvd box.

As for the series, I may be the wrong person to give an objective review. I grew up watching episodes of Amazing Stories with my family and so my opinion of the show is awash in nostalgia. The basic premise is the same as the Twilight Zone, but with less morality and creepiness. The stories are more wondrous and less ominous. Also like the Twilight Zone, Amazing Stories features current and up-and-coming stars from it's time (the first season alone has episodes featuring Charlie Sheen, Keifer Sutherland, and others).

In the end, it's hard to go wrong with Amazing Stories. As a family show, it's a great buy. Kids of all ages will love the stories and adults will find humorous and heart-warming moments around every corner!",1294012800,,1101,4.699481865284974

Fortunately the good episodes outnumber the bad.  The bad ones are caused by hackneyed plots, an attempt to be ""cute.""  In one, a precursor to ""ET"" a space alien is befriended by children who help him go home.  There are some that suggest Spielberg's ""The Duel,"" much better as a movie.

Also this was a Steven Spielberg project and it shows it was very well put together considering the technology at the time. I am in the market for season 2 now! I can still remember sunday nights sitting in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on with my transformers toys and garbage pail kids cards not too far off.

They are each about 20 minutes and are like little well-made mini-movies. There are a lot of great actors in these - albeit from the 80's, so they're looking a little young. And it's also great seeing the work of guest directors like Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood. And if you ever saw these on television, the nostalgia is terrific. There was a great episode starring Mark Hamill that I watched on disc 3 that I hadn't seen since it originally aired on television twenty years ago. It's great to see again great entertainment from one's childhood - they don't make television like this anymore. I couldn't recommend this enough!

1503515,3,B00005JN8Q,"When I was younger I remember looking forward to watching this show.  I even had a few episodes recorded off air on VHS that I watched several times - especially ""No Day at the Beach"" (in this set) and ""Family Dog"" (in the second season, not in this set).

Even as a teen, however, I remember frequently feeling let down by what I saw versus what was expected - ""amazing"" stories.  In many many episodes there is just zero tension as to what's going to happen next.

In ""Ghost Train"" grandpa says the 407 is going to pick him up that night and smash through the house and that's exactly what happens.  Along the way we get to see some borderline campy acting.  Or there were episodes where the solution was just silly nonsensical such as with ""The Mission"" when the fighter plane is saved by a . . . drawing.  Yes, a drawing.

The shows tended to either of these two patterns - either a telegraphed plot or a deus ex machina ending.

I don't think the issue is just that this show was filmed in the 80s.  I've rewatched many St. Elsewhere episodes and, once they got out of the first season, most are still good by today's standards.  Ditto for ""Hill Street Blues.""

After all these years the only episode ever of ""Amazing Stories"" that truly stands the test of time IMO is season two's ""Family Dog.""  I've watched it several times over the years and it's always funny.  Unfortunately, my VHS copy has worn out and it's not included in this set.

The only thing that stood out to me by watching these shows was getting to see the earlier/lesser known work of various actors such as Kevin Costner, Kiefer Sutherland, Harvey Keitel and others.  Otherwise, I found myself actually fast forwarding through scenes because they were just too silly. Die hard fans might scoff and, based on the many positive reviews here, the show has held well with many viewers.

1503649,4,B00005JN8Q,"The stories ranged from outstanding to so-so and, overall, had enough good ones to warant purchasing the first season of this mid-1980s TV series. My favorites: were ""Fine Tuning,"""" ""The Doll,""  ""Santa `85"" and ""Mr. Magic."" Here are a few quick comments about those episodes:

""Amazing"" is a good adjective for ""Fine Tuning,"" which is hilarious.....one of the funniest half- hour shows I've ever seen on ANY television program. .There are so many gags, both verbal and sight, that I lost count. People who know all the television references in here, from ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Three Stooges,"" ""Burns and Allen"" to ""Ponderosa"" and at least a half dozen more, will get a lot more laughs than young people who are unfamiliar with shows. The same holds true for Milton Berle, who makes a guest appearance in here, with some funny lines. . Not only was this fantastically funny, but the ending was touching....a really nice finish that made you feel good.

""The Doll"" was a change of pace....and one for the good; a wonderful story. Many viewers might find this a lot slower than the normal fare, but I really enjoyed and was touched by the sentiment. It's by far the best thing I've seen John Lithgow do. I'm not a fan of his but fair is fair, and he was absolutely terrific in this. He plays a meek, sad and lonely 42-year-old who finds love in the strangest of ways.

""Santa '85"" was a nice sentimental story, even if it was predictable in the end. It was a good Christmas story and ran, of course, in the middle of December in 1985. It would have been a great show to air on Christmas Eve. Douglas Seale is excellent as Santa Claus, who winds up in jail on a ""breaking and entering"" charge! Pat Hingle plays the sheriff who arrests him and a man who desperately needs a little dose of Christmas spirit..
On the whole, this story had a lot of charm to it, as well as humor

Sid Caesar was just great in ""Mr. Magic."". He plays ""Lou Bundles,"" a veteran magician, a guy who has performed at this same nightclub for 50 years! He's losing it, his talent and his mind but just before he's about to be fired, Lou takes a trip into an old magic shop and buys a deck of old playing cards.. These cards are....well....amazing and pretty soon Lou is talking to them as if they were human. In the end, Lou....well.....goes out in style.",1188950400,3,2320,4.475177304964539
1503650,5,B00005JN8Q,"This show was on for a brief while back in the mid-80's. Featuring great actors, imaginative scripts, terrific direction, there wasn't much not to like about this great anthology series. Some of the episodes will remind you of 'Twilight Zone' or O. Henry stories. It reminded me of how fresh Speilberg's directorial style was and how great storytelling is always entertaining.

1503652,4,B00005JN8Q,"At first glance, Amazing Stories seems a waste of an anthology series.  It wasn't as timely and will never be as revered as ""The Twilight Zone"". It lacks the shock potential of ""Night Gallery"" or ""Tales From The Crypt"", the suspense of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", and most of the time it lacks the quality writing of all of them.  Yet, there is a place for Amazing Stories, and that place has to do with fun.

Whether an episode is dealing with a murderous toupee, a man who'se dark stories are coming to life to claim him, or a touching story about an old man who befriends a little girl in a coma, there is always a moment that will give me a smile.

One thing that goes through my mind every time I watch Amazing Stories is ""You will never see a new show like this again.""  Of course, that thought goes through my mind when I view many of the old programs.

From season to season the type of storytelling on television changes, the shock meter goes up, the language gets worse, and the mood gets darker.  Plus, so many  shows today focus so much on making things as real as possible that there is really no point in watching them sometimes.  Don't get me wrong, I love shows like ""24"" and ""House"", but there are times I want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a quick, simple story without the trappings of the current television era.

I purchased it for a couple of favorite episodes, ""Mummy Daddy"", ""The Mission"", ""The Main Attraction"".. alright more than a couple.

The real drawback here and the reason for my initial comment is that the episodes are mostly too short to tell the story properly and many times I felt as if I was watching a condensed version of a movie. A lot of detail left out, characters not developed as fully as they should be, abrupt endings, etc. Not always but enough to leave me feeling like I'd been abandoned by the story teller.

1503748,5,B00005JN8Q,"This TV series aired for 1 TV season during the late 1980s on network television.  Each episode was approximately 30 minutes long, and the entire spectrum of episodes spanned the genres of comedy, tragedy, romance, suspense, action, fantasy, and adventure.  They were directed by Steven Spielberg, and starred many actors and actresses who would go on to later fame and fortune such as Tim Robbins, James Cromwell, Kevin Costner, Sean Bean, Sam Waterston, etc...

The episodes ranged from okay to very good, and many of them would inspire full-length feature movies in the proceeding decades.  For example, one episode is about a lady named Jane who discovers that her entire life has been scripted and filmed as a movie.  Sounds a lot like the Truman Show.  Another episode is about two brothers who scare of every babysitter until they encounter one who turns their antics back on them.  This seems quite similar to Nanny McPhee.  A third episode is about two ghosts who haunt a house and chase out residents they do not like.  Ever heard of BeetleJuice?

First time directors (Matthew Robbins, Joan Darling, William Dear, Timothy Hutton) as well as top names (Burt Reynolds,Peter Hyams, Clint Eastwood,Paul Bartel, Martin Scorsese)just jumped on board to present these short films for tv. The show lasted pnly two seasons. This collection is  only season one on DVD

There are a few misses like Guilt Trip (directed by Burt Reynolds) and Dorothy and Ben (director Thomas Carter). However the hits like Mummy Daddy, The Mission, Remote Control Man (I think an episode 20 years ahead of its time-think the movie Pleasantville), Mr Magic (with the great Sid Caesar), and The Amazing Falsworth (with Gregory Hines).

On the whole, these Stories are Amazing  (great almost 20 years later) and worth it for anybody's DVD library

1503813,3,B00005JN8Q,"They say hindsight is 20/20, but ""they"" are not always right. I loved AMAZING STORIES as a kid---I moderately like it as an adult.

Most of these episodes have excellent concepts and original ideas. Some of them are even prophetic, especially ""Secret Cinema,"" which predates TRUMAN SHOW by a decade and foresees the popularity of reality TV. However, many of the episodes do not feel fully developed and end as soon as you start getting interested. Others are just plain BAD, in every department imaginable: writing, acting, pacing, effects, editing, EVERYTHING (""Fine Tuning,"" ""Hell Toupee"").

The two biggest problems this series had were tone and audience. Specifically, was this series supposed to be scary? Funny? Mysterious? Cute and sweet? All of the above? And who was intended to watch it? Five-year-olds with ADHD? Geeky English grads? Lonely grandmothers? Again, all of the above? Consequently, this season, though many of the episodes are indispensable gems (""The Mission,"" ""The Doll""), feels, as a whole, a bit messy and indecisive.

I feel I need to defend ""One for the Road"" and ""One for the Books,"" both of which many ""fans"" lambast. The former is an excellent study in desperation and mob mentality and also features a convincing performance by James Cromwell. The latter is just an entertaining and thoughtful piece of science fiction. What a peaceful way for aliens to learn all there is to know about Earth!

Season 1 is overall a clear winner. There were a few episodes I found quite boring but there were many more I absolutely loved. My personal ratings on the episodes of season 1 are:

1 Ghost Train 9/10~ Great series opener. It had Steven Spiellberg's magical touch throughout it.

2 The Main Attraction~ 8/10 Pretty clever episode.

3 Alamo Jobe 6/10 ~ ok episode. A bit boring

4 Mummy, Daddy 10/10 ~ This was the first masterpiece, IMHO. Great, hilarious episode!

5 The Mission 10/10 ~ if Mummy Daddy was the first comic masterpiece, The Mission was the frist dramatic masterpiece.

6 The Amazing Falsworth 8/10 ~ very good, suspenseful episode

7 Fine Tuning 7/10 ~ kinda cute and kooky, but not top notch

8 Mr. Magic 7/10 ~another pretty good episode but not top notch

9 Guilt Trip 5/10 ~not one of my favorites, I was quite bored with it.

10 Remote Control Man 5/10 ~another below average episode for me

11 Santa '85  8/10 ~considering there are too many Santa themed episodes on tv to count, this one was very enjoyable

12 Vanessa in the Garden 10/10 ~beautiful episode. Exquisite.

13 The Sitter 8/10 ~I found this episode quite funny.

14 No Day at the Beach 8/10 ~this is the second ""War"" themed episode (The Mission was the first), and although not as excellent as The Mission, it was still very good

15 One For the Road 5/10 another below average.

16 Gather Ye Acorns 3/10 I really didn't like this one at all. I suppose I'm being generous by giving it a 3.

17 Boo! 8/10 ~ Cute episode. Reminded me of Beetlejuice (Ghost's living in attic trying to get rid of new tennants)

18 Dorothy and Ben 10/10 ~ another beautiful episode.

19 Mirror, Mirror 10/10 ~absolutely top notch and the first episode to scare me silly. Better than some of the ""horror"" movies of the modern era.

20 Secret Cinema  6/10 ~ Ok episode, reminded me of The Truman Show

21 Hell Toupee 1/10 ~this is by far the worst episode, IMHO. Comparing HT to an episode like ""The Mission"" is quite laughable.

22 The Doll 10/10 ~ Another beautiful, exquiste episode. John Lithgow probably gave one of the finest performances of the entire first sesason.

23 One For the Books 4/10 ~ what a let down after ""The Doll"".

24 Grandpa's Ghost 9/10  ~ wonderful ending to Season 1

With the exception of a few, I thought most of the episodes were definitely above average. Also the impressive roster of guest stars: Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Gregory Hines, Sam Waterson, Harvey Kitel, and of course, John Lithgow, to name a few, gave the audience the feeling they were watching a mini-movie each week.

1503817,4,B00005JN8Q,"In the wake of his blockbuster films ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and ""E.T."", NBC got Steven Spielberg to create a television anthology series.  Spielberg's first directing gig was for one of the early episodes of Rod Serling's ""Night Gallery"" (the one with Joan Crawford as a blind woman), and of course the director was weaned on the classic anthology series ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Outer Limits,"" and ""One Step Beyond.""  Spielberg was going to revive the genre with ""Amazing Stories,"" a half-hour anthology series that last two seasons (1985-87), but it did not happen even though he got the likes of Kevin Costner (""The Mission""), Mark Hamill (""Gather Ye Acorns,"" and Sid Caesar (""Mr. Magic"") to star in episodes (not to mention next gen actors like Charlie Sheen and Keifer Sutherland), as well as getting Burt Reynolds (""Guilt Trip""), Clint Eastwood (""Vanessa in the Garden""), Martin Scorcese (""Mirror, Mirror""), Paul Bartel (""Secret Cinema""), and Joe Dante (""Boo!"") to direct (Note: the Michael Moore who directed ""Alamo Jobe"" is not the Michael Moore who did ""Roger & Me"" and other lighthearted documentary fare, but rather Michael D. Moore, who was the second unit director on the Indiana Jones movies).

Watching these 24 first-season episodes again, there are many more mundane outings than ones we would consider to be truly amazing.  Spielberg directs two of the episodes, the ""Ghost Train"" pilot and ""The Mission,"" but he came up with the stories for another dozen episodes, so this was clearly his series.  In many ways that first episode, ""Ghost Train,"" represents the series as a whole. The point of the episode is to have a steam locomotive crash through a living room wall and drive a train through a family's house.  That is certainly a compelling image, and we get it from multiple camera angles, but the story that accompanies the stunt is not as good, despite Robert Blossom's performance as Old Pa.  ""The Mission"" is much better offering an effective portrayal of a B-17 bombing mission during World War II going wrong before pulling some magic out of a hat.

For me ""Dorothy and Ben"" is far and away the best episode.  Ben Dumfy (Joe Seneca) wakes up after 40 years in a coma to find he is an old man.  He also discovers that he had talk to Dorothy (Natalie Gregory), a 7-year-old girl who has been in a coma for two weeks.  Lane Smith and Louis Giambalvo are the doctors, Kathleen Lloyd and Joe Regalbuto are Dorothy's parents, and I watched these four DVDs because I wanted to watch this episode again (several times in fact).  All of the other episodes I like, such as ""Alamo Jobe,"" ""The Amazing Falsworth,"" and ""The Doll,"" have simple ideas and play them out without becoming truly memorable.  An episode like ""Santa '85"" or Timothy Hutton's ""Grandpa's Ghost"" becomes quite representative, because once you understand the set up you can figure out the payoff.  Even with an episode ""Gather Ye Acorns,"" which I can obviously appreciate because of my own collections of comic books, baseball cards, and Buffy figures, the idea ends up being vastly superior to the execution.  I do not know why, but watching these episodes again was not as enjoyable as watching ""Zone"" episodes the second, third and umpteenth time around.

If you do the math most of the episodes are ""Twilight Zone"" like in nature during this first season, including a pair written by Serling's best writer, Richard Matheson (""The Doll"" and ""One for the Books"").  But Spielberg is more willing to come up with humorous episodes, with decidedly mixed results.  ""Mummy Daddy,"" in which an actor playing a mummy in a movie makes the mistake of racing off to the hospital where his wife is giving birth without getting out of his makeup and costume or checking the fuel gauge, is pretty good.  But for the most part ""The Main Attraction,"" ""Fine Tuning,"" ""Guilt Trip,"" ""Boo!,"" and ""Hell Toupee"" try too much and lack the requisite subtlety.  ""Remote Control Man"" and ""Secret Cinema"" have unrealized potential, although any excuse to get Barbara Billingsley on camera is greatly appreciated.  This is why an episode like ""The Sitter,"" where Mabel King plays a sitter who does that voodoo she do so well to young Seth Green and his brother, becomes paradigmatic because obviously Spielberg wants ""Amazing Stories"" to skew a lot younger than Serling did with the ""Zone.""  Consequently, something like ""One for the Road"" may well run a little too dark for the kiddies.",1153526400,10,4500,4.877952755905512
1503818,5,B00005JN8Q,I was so delighted to see this wonderful series on DVD.  I have waited for so long to get these.  They truly deserved all the awards they got.  I never realized what a stellar cast of actors played on these episodes nor the caliber of directors either.  This series is well worth the money and the wait time.

The first season is a ""must-own"" for any fan of sci-fi/fantasy anthology television. Do not pass this collection in the stores. Your regret shall be your epitaph.",1153267200,7,616,5.03921568627451
1503820,4,B00005JN8Q,"""Amazing Stories"" was the result of a two-season, 45-episode commitment and full creative control deal NBC offered Steven Spielberg to entice the filmmaker into television series production, and Spielberg's own desire to revive the anthology format. Unfortunately, Amazing Stories neither measured up to expectations nor found a large audience.

Critics and historians argued the anthology format itself had fallen out of favor years earlier, and efforts to revive it (including two other 1985 offerings, the remakes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" which immediately followed Amazing Stories on Sunday nights at 8:30p) ultimately failed. It probably didn't help that Amazing Stories was up against CBS's ""Murder She Wrote"" and ABC's then-hot new series ""MacGyver"" at the time.

While the segments from Amazing Stories were rarely ""amazing"" (though some, of course, were standout episodes), the series itself was an admirable mix of interesting storytelling. And though most of the stories were conceived (and a few directed) by Spielberg himself, the A-list of talent Spielberg amassed for the series (Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, etc.) were used accordingly. That includes legendary composer John Williams who provided the magnificent opening theme that perfectly emcompassed that sense of wonder and imagination associated with Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment.

Amazing Stories - The Complete 1st Season is a 4-disc (single-sided) set featuring all 24 episodes from the 1985-1986 season, Full-Frame (1.33:1) Video, English Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio, English and Spanish subtitles, plus extras. The set has a running time of 683 min. Though some episodes of Amazing Stories were previously released on VHS some years ago as ""Book installments"", this set marks the first-time release of the show's complete first season on DVD!

Special Features include Deleted Scenes:
*Disc One: ""The Main Attraction""
*Disc Two: ""Guilt Trip"", ""Remote Control Man"", ""Vanessa in the Garden""
*Disc Three: ""One For the Road"", ""Boo!"", ""Dorothy and Ben""
*Disc Four: ""Secret Cinema"", ""The Doll"", ""One For The Books"", ""Grandpa's Ghost""

1503821,5,B00005JN8Q,"In the 80's, Stephen Spielberg could almost do no wrong. He had a ton of hit movies under his belt, and decided it was time to try a project he'd been toying with for years. ""Amazing Stories"" was a show produced by Spielberg in which every episode was supposed to be a mini-movie. Indeed, most of these came from ideas he had or had read but couldn't fill out enough for a movie. Thus the world was treated to thirty-minute vignettes of sheer brilliance boasting a cast of well-known 80's icons like Charlie Sheen, Kevin Costner, Andrew McCarthy, John Lithgow, Dom DeLuise, and Kiefer Sutherland. The budget for a series like this today would be astronomical, so we'll probably never see the likes of it again.

 Like ""The Twilight Zone"" before it, each episode stood alone with a trip to the odd or surreal moments of life. Some were touching (like ""Vanessa in the Garden"" and ""Grandpa's Ghost""), some were funny (like ""Mummy, Daddy"" and ""The Main Attraction""), and some were just plain scary (like ""Mirror, Mirror"" and ""The Doll"")--but most were perfect.

 Collecting just the first season, this DVD set showcases 24 of the best episodes of the series. The production values on the episodes was amazing at the time, and as a result they really aren't as dated as you'd think. ""Remote Control Man"" is funny because you see cameos from some of TV's biggest stars at the time (Dirk Benedict of ""The A-Team"", Gary Coleman of ""Diff'rent Strokes"", Richard Simmons, and even Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk just to name a few) as a man's dream remote slowly turns his life from perfect television bliss to chaos.

 Other great episodes include ""Mummy, Daddy"" (my all-time favorite episode), in which an actor from a horror movie tries to get to the hospital where his wife is having a baby--while still in costume as a mummy. ""The Mission"" is a special hour long episode starring Kevin Costner and Kiefer Sutherland about a World War 2 bomber crew coming home from a brutal mission, and finding themselves forced to make a life-and-death decision for one of their own in the process. ""The Amazing Falsworth"" has Gregory Hines portraying a nightclub psychic who finds himself accidentally reading the mind of a murderer somewhere in his audience.

 The funny episodes are balanced out with serious ones, and that's what keeps the show from getting old. There are even moments of sheer terror in a few shows like ""Mirror, Mirror"" where a horror author sees a hooded figure trying to kill him in the mirrors.

 Are there duds in this set? I don't think so. And I hope they bring out the second (and final) season too because it had some great stories as well. Stars like Christopher Lloyd and Weird Al Yankovic got into the act in the second season, and of course the cartoon episode ""Family Dog"" (which later went on to become a short-lived series of its own) can't be forgotten.

 The set contains about 20 minutes of deleted scenes from various episodes, but that's all by way of extras. It's a shame since it would have been great to hear commentary by at least a few of the stars or directors on the shows, but at least it's something--which is more than can be said for a lot of other sets out there. While I can't say I'm thrilled with the packaging, I'm just glad to see this wonderful show finally come to DVD.",1153008000,3,3315,4.638225255972697
1503942,4,B00005JN8Q,"I was not overly dazzled by some of the shallow stories of Amazing Stories. There were times, however, where I was completely enthralled. ""Dorothy and Ben"" had me glued to the set and in tears with the fantastic ending monologe of Natalie Gregory (the little girl). Ghost Train was a good story with some great acting. The Mission was a great story, however, the ending left me flat. I would have rathered a real great epiphany of an idea on how to solve the problem at hand rather than a metaphysical one.

Most of these have sugary endings, but still recommended for the library. Be careful not to sit your kids down to watch these. Prescreen for content to make sure they are appropriate for the age of your kids and what you want them to see.",1152662400,3,746,4.445255474452555

It gave me a moment every week, if only for 30 minutes, to escape my reality and just dream. I've read some of the other reviews, one stating that the show was ""dumbed down"" for children. I totally disagree with that statement. Children aren't dumb. Children are imaginative. Unfortunately, as we get older, we stop using our imaginations. We stop believing in fantasy. No Santa Claus. No Tooth Fairy. None of the light-hearted fantasies that make childhood so fascinating. Amazing Stories offered entertainment for the entire family--fostering childrens' imaginations and stirring up the child in every adult viewer.

1503948,3,B00005JN8Q,"It is probably telling that many of the positive reviews are by folks who remember this series fondly from childhood. I was older when it aired, and I may be more critical as a result.

First, a bit of background... Steven Spielberg wanted to revive The Twilight Zone series in the 1980's. Spielberg began his career directing a segment of the Night Gallery pilot, and wanted to do an homage to Rod Serling. He had already produced the Twlight Zone feature film, to mixed reviews; and CBS (the TZ rights holder) refused to let him remake the series. (Interestingly, CBS did remake The Twilight Zone in the 80's, and it competed with Amazing Stories.) So Spielberg looked for an alternative, and found it in the science fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories, and TSR (the owners of Amazing Stories at the time) sold him the rights to the title to make the series.

Unfortunately, Spielberg did not enlist the magazine's writers at the time to do stories for the show. Many of the episodes were written by Spielberg himself, or by the usual television hacks. As a result, many scripts were filled with old Sci-Fi cliches, already worn-out by 1980. Hence the inconsistant writing quality and overuse of cliches. One exception to this was Richard Matheson, a veteran genre writer who contributed to the first season of Amazing Stories and took some control of the series during its second season (which was much better).

To return to my comment in the first paragraph, the tone of Amazing Stories was usually much less mature than The Twilight Zone, and series felt like it was aimed at a younger audience (maybe 10 to 15 years old). The episodes were often comic, again in keeping with younger viewers. So, if you were a young adult when you first viewed the series, you may now have fond memories of it (and you would not have been aware of the cliches).

On the plus side, the directing was usually excellent, performances were outstanding, visual effects were cutting edge, and many of the scripts were quite good (in particular ""The Doll"", written by Richard Matheson and winner of a Hugo award that year). But, ultimately, I was a little disappointed in Amazing Stories, because it could have been so much more. Despite that, I will buy this DVD when it is released, I just won't rewatch it as often.

Note: to the reviewer wanting a series to show his/her children, pick up Jim Henson's The Storyteller on DVD. It is an excellent introduction to classic folk & fairy tales that is well-written and not ""dumbed down"" for kids.",1145750400,39,2529,4.72562358276644

1503951,5,B00005JN8Q,"There are some things that are just special. Special things or moments that are benchmarks for a certain period in your life. Well, this show was one of them for me. Along with the likes of ""The Goonies"", ""Stand By Me"", and any John Hughes film of the 80's, this show was one of those treasures from my childhood that makes me look back fondly on it with such great nostalgia. I loved this show. I watched it regularly, and was always looking forward to seeing what strange trip Spielberg and crew were going to take us on this week. Of course, at this time Spielberg could do no wrong, so it was obvious to me that I was going to be right there for this show. I had already seen ""E.T."" and I had gone to the theaters with my dad to see ""Temple Of Doom"" 11 times. Spielberg wanted a show every week that he had described to the network would be like campfire tales. It's too bad that in it's time, the show was never really appreciated for what it was. It was not a big hit, but Spielberg was already promised a two season pick up. I have no idea why the show was not regarded very highly by people back then, and it still seems to fight for respect and recognition today. It doesn't make sense to me. Anyways, this was a wonderful and fantastic show that delivered the goods every week. Sure, not all of the episdoes were huge winners, but they never disappointed in creativity and were always fun to watch. So, what does season one have to deliver?. The premiere episode, ""Ghost Train"", is a pretty good one, but the first real classic of season one is the episode, ""Mummy, Daddy"". This is one of many that I always remember. It's about an actor named Harold who is playing a mummy in a movie. He goes to his wife who is going into labor, and doesn't know that a real mummy has come to life. Classic episode. Then there is ""The Mission"". Starring Kevin Costner, this has to be one of the most remembered episodes. A world wat II crew's belly gunner is stuck in his seat in the bottom of the plane and it appears that he will be crushed upon landing...until a miracle happens. A brilliant and magical episode. ""Fine Tuning"" is kind of a silly, but fun, episode about a teen who picks up an outer space signal that aliens are coming, and the aliens come to Hollywood and want to take people back with them. ""Mr. Magic"" has the great Sid Caesar playing an aging and fading magician who gets a new shot at his career with the help of a magical deck of cards. ""Remote Control Man"" is another favorite of mine. A harried man with a horrible family life is able to bring TV images to life. One episode that will always be cherished by moi is ""Santa '85"", a charming ep about a boy who helps Santa after he's jailed while delivering presents. Another top ep I remember quite fondly. Shot in black and white, ""No Day At The Beach"" finds a put upon GI try to save the lives of his comrades in World War II. Charlie Sheen appears in this one. John Lithgow stars in ""The Doll"", a finely written piece about a man's obsession with a doll he got for his niece. These eps are the best of the bunch. Not that the others are bad. The show got top notch talent behind the scenes with people like Richard Matheson, Martin Scorsesse, Paul Bartel, Joe Dante, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Bob Balaban, Mick Garris, and of course, Steve Spielberg. The first season also had an array of great guest stars like Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Costner, Gregory Hines, Milton Berle, Charles Durning, Sid Caesar, Charles Nelson Reilly, Harvey Keitel, Beau Bridges, Seth Green, James Cromwell, Joe Pantoliano, Forest Whitaker, Sam Waterston, Tim Robbins, Eve Arden, Griffin Dunne, and others. The show was amazing shot and filmed, and even when the stories went to the extremely goofy and silly, I think it was meant to be that way. Some were quite cheesy and hammy, but I believe that it was the show's intent to be kind of slapsticky in the old school ways. Hopefully, the show will finally get the respect it deserves. It is a fine, fine show that was wonderfully designed and brings back so many fond memories. Who knows what more Spielberg could of given us if the show had continued. Seasn two contained more of my absolute favorites, and I hope that DVD is soon on it's way. Do yourself a favor and get this DVD to rediscover the magic of this wonderful show.",1122336000,148,4334,4.391791044776119
