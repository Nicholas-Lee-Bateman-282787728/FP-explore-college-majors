6265435,1,B00IINW6IK,"Amazon is starting to feel like a big scam. This was and is not a movie. It was a pilot for a TV series that got cancelled before it even aired. HOW DARE AMAZON sell this as a movie. I will be calling them and demanding my money back. There is no ending, weak story line and actors who really try and do a good job, but on a ten dollar budget. If you rent this and are mad, remember I WARNED YOU. Worst purchase I have ever made.",1404864000,3,429,3.831460674157303

6265437,3,B00IINW6IK,"In the year 2045 the Arctic ice cap is gone revealing a some kind of archipelago. Borealis is an international somewhat Canadian controlled settlement. with various nations doing mineral and oil explorations. Vic (Ty Olsson) is a customs agent and bar owner, the only past time. The bar is also the setting for prostitutes, of which we only know one (Cristina Rosato).

The plot was all over the place and the end doesn't tie anything together, if it really needed to be tied together. There is a dead Norwegian archeologist tossed from a helicopter. He has a six inch spike. The Russians are performing an archeological dig to show the Russians were here centuries earlier giving them a ""national sovereignty claim."" Exactly how that works, I don't know. Allison (Michelle Harrison) is a naturalist for the Canadian government protecting endangered species, especially from the Russians or ""Vodka retards"" as she calls them. There is also an American archeologist who never finds anything and I am not sure about his motive. The bar complex, made from old shipping containers has a ""zip grab"" an anti-gravity holding room. The Canadian military has a presence as does a representative from the League of Nations, which has apparently replaced the UN. They are often referred to it as ""the L-O-N"" in the film. There is also a place for cage matches to the death. Vic is a former boxer, as was one of the Russians...guess where this goes. It also seems Vic was dead at one time and brought back to life, something he can do with a series of injections, which doesn't blend into the film too well. And there is an old legend about a headless man, a theme which pops up from time to time...why? I don't know. Oh yes, there is also a drug called ""ghost meth"" that made a Mongolian go berserk...clearly a Russian plot.

The setting feels like the Old West located on an alien planet. Allison was the most colorful character, while the rest were shades of gray, perhaps a reflection of this world. Supplies are delivered by CG zeppelins which appear in every scene. When the film ended, I was scratching my head. Is that it? ""Rocky IV?""

This appears to be some sort of TV pilot, for a series I won't watch. The DVD cover leads one to believe the film is some sort of Arctic battle in the snow, which is incorrect. That scene never happened.

Okay as a low expectation sci-fi rental.

6265438,4,B00IINW6IK,"Although the DVD cover for this film appears pretty generic, the plot of this little science-fiction gem is not.  SURVIVAL CODE is definitely a case of don't judge a book (or movie) by its cover); this is certainly not the movie I thought it was going to be.  I expected more of a military-style flick, but instead got a gritty and intriguing futuristic political-mystery.  And although I was surprised, I was also thoroughly entertained and pleased.  This film is a nifty, unique foray into a (sorta) post-apocalyptic yet possible world.

This movie feels like the pilot for a TV show; theres so much going on and so many interesting characters that you could definitely build a lot out of this.  And it would certainly be on my Must Watch list for this season!

SURVIVAL CODE is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, which is evident in the digital special effects that are used to promote the technology on the show (i.e. holographic data displays, etc.).  I love it when smaller-budget films and TV series use some of the budget to make sure the little things look good as wellit makes the piece so much more credible.

The acting is good as well.  I particularly enjoyed Ty Olssons performance as the main character, Vic.  I cant recall ever seeing Olsson in a lead role before, but he does an excellent job.  I hope he has future projects with a similar persona.

If I were forced to find a flaw with SURVIVAL CODE, it would have to be the very end scene.  Not to give anything away, but it kinda leaves you scratching your head.  I think I know what the final shot was, but Im not sure.  As a result, the vagueness of explanation left me with a frown.

But the rest of the movie is superb, and I highly recommend checking it out.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look.",1400198400,,1841,4.474474474474475
6265439,1,B00IINW6IK,"Negatives:
1. Lots of several second black screen scenes as if the editor didn't know how to fill empty space. Speaking of editing, the scenes jumped so much I had nightmares afterwards with kangaroos in them. Really poor disjointed directing.
2. A storyline that seemed to not have any direction - as if several writers collaborated with no consensus as to what the central theme should be. Was it commentary about humans depleting resources; was it saving polar bears & foxes; was it corporate greed; was it political corruption; was it a hole-in-the-wall booze/sex joint; was it the bad Russians (as usual); was it cage fighting.
3. Acting? As to be expected since 95% of everyone's resumes consisted of TV shorts/series.
4. Their research on the critical subject matter of resource depletion. Not even remotely likely that (in their plot theme) in thirty years all of Earth's oil, gas and minerals are in one remote spot in Canada.
5. Other research. An anti-gravity fun room in this remote Canadian bar!! I'm afraid they'll have to go a lot further into the Universe to find it - not even possible.
6. Cheap CGI scene repeated nauseously over and over of a background burning of something in two localities with airships hauling the same thing in the same spot overhead. The rest of the movie consisted of some shipping containers converted into living establishments.",1400112000,2,1373,4.922413793103448
6265440,5,B00IINW6IK,"Formerly titled Borealis, this critically acclaimed, and award winning, Sci-Fi television pilot movie has been renamed and repackaged for home video. Do not let the cheesy box cover fool you: this was outstanding!

The year is 2045 and the ice caps have melted. The last oil and gas reserves on the planet are discovered in the Canadian North, and everybody wants their piece. At the center of a growing international fight for control is the gold rush frontier town of Borealis. Vic Carboneau, a former MMA champion turned entrepreneur, tries to keep the peace while running his own bar/hotel/brothel and acting as customs agent for the Canadian government. A murder mystery sets events in motion that threaten everything Vic has built, and the people hes come to care for.

Well-written, politically savvy, action packed (including one of the most realistic-choreographed cage fights youve ever seen), Survival Code offers a possible glimpse of things to come in the wake of environmental disaster.

The cast is loaded with familiar Sci-Fi genre faces, including Ty Olsson (Supernatural, Battlestar Galactica), Patrick Gallagher (Night At The Museum, Glee), Terry Chen (Continuum, House Of Cards), Michelle Harrision (Continuum, Hit n Strum), and Greyston Holt (Bitten, Alcatraz). Their chemistry (especially between Ty and Patrick) really shines on screen.

Please keep in mind this was a TV pilot, meant to continue in a series that, unfortunately, was passed on; as such, the ending can seem a bit abrupt. Its a shame, really; Borealis/Survival Code wouldve made a magnificent series.",1400112000,10,1589,5.318725099601593
6265441,4,B00IINW6IK,"I agree with the reviewer who said this had to be a made for TV type of movie; yet, more like a pilot for a series, that somehow wasn't fessed up to. Still the action and noir near-future artic resource-intrigues were above average. It strayed just far enough away from the standard Hollywood formula, that it actually becomes entertaining. It could also be a sarcastic insiders' view of the Hollywooded Series Industry; a copyrighted straightjacket, that has a hands-off approach on sensitive national security issues(Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALIST EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS).
In other words, a Hollywooded chic-antithesis to the speaking truth to power Max Keiser Reports(three 26 minute free weekly videos on the internet), and/or Joseph P. Farrell's Breakaway Civilization that are a stellar series of scholastic out-of-this world non-fiction works, and/or the Catherin Austin Fitt's writings & videos of the ongoing: Financial Coup d'&eacute;tat & Deep Black Ops.

6265442,3,B00IINW6IK,"This has got to be a made for t.v. movie...it even blacks out,between sceans, as if the commercials have been removed.
Patrick Gallagher is a good enough actor ..i noticed him first in (HELL ON WHEELS) as the union LT.
THE ACTION IS PRETTY STANDARD with 1...2...3... FIGHTS,.... with no real great moves.
Its just ok, if you have seen all the other new releases in the action film department.
If you miss this film,... no big deal!!!",1399852800,3,433,4.564102564102564

8642380,1,B00IINW6IK,"In case you were wondering; this is NOT a movie about paratroopers or special forces soldiers fighting in cold weather as the cover might lead you to believe. In fact, no paratroopers ever appear nor do any soldiers so clearly--like a book, you cannot tell a DVD by its cover! What you have here is a rather confusing, United Nations, control of the worlds last remaining resources, plus some poaching of the last polar bears on earth, and oh yeah, le'ts throw in a cage fight to end the film. What the fight has to do with the previous 90 minutes of the movie I still don't understand. But by all means, watch this slow, talky, dumb movie to the end just to see our hero walk outside after the fight is over, look up into the sky & see an aircraft/zeppelin fly over and then roll credits. The movie has such a bizarre ending I had to replay it thinking my DVD player had jumped ahead or something. This movie stinks--but hey, the DVD cover looks cool.",1420070400,2,952,4.353932584269663
