8263501,5,B0016MLW7G,"Probably more for pilots because it's dry and procedural but fascinating because these beautiful airplanes are still in use. Memory evoking because I grew up in the shadow of Idlewild, now JFK, airport, and both watched these a/c and flew in them as a passenger and was inspired to go on and get my ticket.",1334880000,,306,4.581818181818182
8263502,5,B0016MLW7G,"I watched this video and liked it allot. I just wish they had more DVD's of the old planes. The Everts DC-6 was outstanding and with a running time of 3 hours I had much to see. I would have liked more information on the engines and instrument that monitor them. These types of airplanes were not around when I flew in the USAF at least I did not see any. Anyone with an interest in aviation and old planes will love this DVD. I just wish there was a DVD for the old Constellations. You will really enjoy this video. Yes it is a few dollars more then a regular video but we are talking about something that would only appeal to aviation buffs and pilots which makes it a limited distribution and therefore cost a few dollars more. Of course it was only $30 not the $100 listed. When I bought the last one they said more were on the way and should be at the $30 price. It is also available at ""[...]"". It was well worth the money to me.",1264377600,,935,4.086956521739131
8263503,3,B0016MLW7G,"Many of Everts C-118's are ex USN and USAF, some of which I flew while on active duty with the Navy. This DVD brings back a lot of memories. The price is a bit steep, but the content is nearly impossible to find elsewhere these days. The video and audio are typical for operations of this type aircraft. It's shot in Alaska, and there's lots of interesting footage, but we're not talking PBS quality here. Good, but not great.",1210204800,,426,4.405063291139241
