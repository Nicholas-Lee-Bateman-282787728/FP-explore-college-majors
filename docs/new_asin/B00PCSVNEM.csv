6797725,5,B00PCSVNEM,"I am a life long fan of DEVO ! Grew up with them always playing on the stereo. Followed since their beginning.

This concert is evidence that DEVO is LEGENDARY! 21 songs played, their earliest material. Several classics glad to see them play like: SOO BAWLS, BE STIFF, UNCONTROLLABLE URGE, JOCKO HOMO, GUT FEELING, CLOCKOUT and the heart felt song from Booji Boy - U GOT ME BUGGED. Thrilled to see this concert!!! No Doubt!!!

 This concert captures them brilliantly! Will certainly be viewed endless times. A very good mandatory buy for me.

Heartfelt recommendation to buy this concert!",1426636800,2,588,4.909090909090909
6797726,5,B00PCSVNEM,"This is the DVD of the tour the band did in 2014 shortly after the passing of Bob 2.  The show focuses on the early years of Devo and is kind of a walk down memory lane of the late 1970's.  The band is joined by the amazing Josh Frese and Bob 2's son comes on for the encore.  It's a fun show, pure Devo but with one big part missing.  RIP Bob 2!",1426291200,,346,3.635135135135135
6797727,5,B00PCSVNEM,Its a great concert film from a great band doing early strange stuff; I like most of these songs better than their big hits.  IMPORTANT - this is REGION 0 - or ALL REGION. It WILL play on all North American systems!,1425427200,2,215,4.119047619047619
6797728,5,B00PCSVNEM,"I saw DEVO live in 1988 and it was a small club show, video and music low key but so much energy and it was great. I later saw them with Blondie with a full on show, tons of video and lighting and costume changes. This Hardcore show looks like another version of them in concert and one that should not be missed. This video is a great documentary and what surprised me was how so much of this early material is steeped in rock, rockabilly and folk and it shows off their chops as musicians!  A must have for DEVO fans and true fans of punk origins and influences.",1425340800,4,564,4.127272727272727
6797729,5,B00PCSVNEM,"This is a great film; it's a lot of fun to see and hear the early stuff done live as opposed to the umpteen other live albums and concert videos Devo has out there with all the hits (although I love all of those, too). The band actually rocks harder here than they have in a long time, where they have limited ability to do so in their more traditional appearances. It's also poignant in its tribute throughout to Bob 2 and their beginnings. Only minor quibbles, as a 4-piece, the missing second guitar is very noticeable, plus (and maybe this is just me), it's hard to hear ""Gut Feeling"" just wind down rather than surge right into ""Slap Yer Mammy"". But I highly recommend this. Devo's always been a theatrical, visual band, and the movie looks and sounds great.  As for the audio recordings, same thing, great, punchy sound, especially with the vinyl.",1424476800,5,853,4.538961038961039
6797730,5,B00PCSVNEM,Awesome show. The band is tight and the film crew did a great job of filming the concert. Lots of rarely heard songs are played here. If you didn't get a chance to see this tour live then this is the next best thing.,1424131200,8,216,3.9318181818181817
6797731,2,B00PCSVNEM,"This was originally supposed to be for people who helped donate to get this project off the ground, but expanded to the retail space. That's all fine and good, but the execution and PR leaves to be desired. Donators were originally supposed to get it in November, but was then delayed to January, and now it's February, and the general public can now buy it, while some donators, like me, still haven't gotten theirs. I ask you, Devo, why do you bite the hand that feeds you?",1423526400,8,475,4.471264367816092

6797733,5,B00PCSVNEM,"This DEVO HARDCORE LIVE 1974-77 show rocks hard with the early most excellent material.  You spuds expecting ""Whip It"" will be disappointed. It says on the title DEVO Hardcore live songs through 1974 to 1977 played only, and before you review it, please read what the product is first. The set list is a DEVO fans dream. Although I thought they should have started with a real rocking number , instead of ""Mechanical Man"", and should have left out the song "" U Got Me Bugged (Booji Boy)"" out of the set. That is the only song, I went to the restroom during the show. I was at this show in Oakland, and also saw them record this show. They did an awesome outstanding job on this document. This is a top notch show recording of their early Material. I did not go to see them play ""Whip It"" for the millionth time at this show. If you are a true fan you will love this release. I wish they would redo their New Traditionalist Tour live. Even though two members are in the next Dimension now, it would be great to see. That was a fantastic show as well I saw in 1981. Buy this release.

This is what you will get on this release. No Red Energy Domes(Flower Pot Hats, and NO NO NO Whip It)

6797734,3,B00PCSVNEM,The highest quality audio (stereo PCM uncompressed)  is given to the documentary version where every song is ruined by some unnecessary sound byte.  The actual uninterrupted concert video features a devolved AC3 soundtrack.  I wish they had left the music alone in the high-quality version and maybe collected all the sound bytes in one 10 minute featurette.  Or they could have just left them off altogether.,1433721600,7,409,5.151515151515151
6797735,5,B00PCSVNEM,"I was there - and I saw what they did. That's why I had to own it. If you're a fan of DEVO because of ""Whip It,"" you should probably ""Skip It,"" since that's not what is on display here. These are the sounds the Spudboys made before they made it big. This is more performance art than rock and roll - not that it doesn't rock and roll. And it's all in loving tribute to their fallen brother, Bob 2.",1433289600,,397,3.9135802469135803
6797736,3,B00PCSVNEM,"They are still good, but why in the world they missed their number one song in this live performance??  ""Whip It"" has been my favorite, and heard throughout the radio back when. I really thought that they would play this piece, but so very disappointed. Other than that, the show was OK. Guess that I got used to DEVO with their normal costumes, their hard hats, but they didn't do that either. So, without the hard hats and their number one single, this live show is anything but kinda ordinary. I would look further on other DVDs which showcase their collections, plus their number one single.",1431129600,,595,4.613207547169812

6797738,5,B00PCSVNEM,"The Hardcore Devo tour was awesome; I saw the Seattle show.  I had to buy this DVD not only because of my life-long love of Devo, but to relive the high of being there in the audience for my sixth, and most poignant, Devo concert.  This tour was a dedication to the memory of Bob 2 and a portion of the proceeds went to his family to assist the survivors following his unexpected and tragic passing.  I will miss him as I deeply feel the effect that his absence has on my favorite band.
That being said, this DVD is a must have.  If you are a Devo fan, this is one of the three DVDs you should have in your collection.  ""The Complete Truth About De-Evolution,"" ""Devovision: The Men Who Make the Music"" (packaged with ""Butch Devo and the Sundance Gig"", and this one are essential.  Several of the songs performed here haven't been performed live for decades and will probably never be performed live again.  Even though this material originated from a time when Devo was a raw and unpolished garage band, it is being performed by a group of veterans so the songs transition seamlessly from one to the next.  Jerry and Mark give some humorous asides between most of the songs which illuminates the group's history and the song's context.  Interspersed within the video are interviews with the band members, Toni Basil, and others which provides more info, but can be turned off for subsequent play-throughs.  The recording quality is hi-def and is the most beautiful of all their live videos.  The DVD doesn't provide much in the way of extras, but the one thing I found most fascinating was the bit about setting up the ""satisfaction guitar.""
All said, this DVD is fun to watch and will have you dancing around the house and singing along from the opening song ""Mechanical Man"" to the closing tune (and my favorite...I was so stoked to hear it live!) ""Clockout.""",1429488000,,1861,4.575301204819277

6797741,5,B00PCSVNEM,"I had an opportunity to see DEVO in concert a couple of years ago.  This DVD brought back some cherished memories.  My wife has passed away since I received this DVD,  the playing of this particular DVD brings much delight to me.  I plan on punching additional DVD's from Amazon.",1427068800,3,279,4.52
8687488,5,B00PCSVNEM,"DEVO delivers an outstanding concert/documentary of post Bob Casle. The absence of Bob's presence is missed considerably, however, the band carries on with such professionalism in his tribute. R.I.P. BOB!!!",1510704000,,206,5.9
8687489,3,B00PCSVNEM,"The footage is poorly edited. Songs are stopped in the middle and then comments from people are briefly inserted and then the song may continue or not. Devo did not dress up, wearing only tour t shirts.",1477094400,,202,4.486486486486487
8687490,4,B00PCSVNEM,"I was disappointed that the concert footage is all newly recorded concert footage and not the original footage from the 70s when the songs came out. All of the rave reviews on Amazon missed a few flaws with this DVD. The footage is poorly edited. Songs are stopped in the middle and then comments from people are briefly inserted and then the song may continue. Once a song starts I want to hear the song uninterrupted. The could of placed the comments in a separate section from the songs. The HardCore Devo Songs my favorite songs, so I know them all very well, and I can say they did a good job recreating the songs and did not make any mistakes with the songs. Naturally the songs were somewhat different than the original versions on the album. Devo refused to dress up in their costumes, and only appeared in Tour T shirts. This gave the concert a sloppy casual sort of feeling. I saw the original Devo in concert after We are not Men came out. Later on Devo ""decided"" for dress up and they put on a sort of light blue coveralls, that looked like janitors grab. So, I would give them a F for costumes, but an A on quality performances.",1476230400,,1141,4.36150234741784

8687492,3,B00PCSVNEM,"I wish the band would have ditched all the goofball stuff between the songs and the interviews THAT PLAY OVER THE SONGS!!!  Why not just play these great songs like it was 1976 instead of taking us on a walk down memory lane?  It's really great hearing some of the old stuff.  Not all of it's top shelf material but it's still interesting.  Note that you can choose to see the show without all the interview crap thrown on top but it isn't readily apparent.  I didn't see the option, which is buried in the extras menu, until after I'd been incensed by the stupidity of layering interviews in the main track.  In addition, the non-interview version has lower quality sound.  WTF, Devo?  You're smarter than this.",1455321600,5,712,4.551181102362205
8687493,5,B00PCSVNEM,"I live in oakland but i did miss the show, this blu ray makes up for it for sure, beautiful picture, excellent sound, nice insert booklet with pledgers names listed....how cool, how did i miss this campaign. Anyway very cultish set list overall super excellent,  a very must buy!!!",1455062400,2,281,4.73469387755102
8687494,5,B00PCSVNEM,"Admittedly, I love DEVO. This DVD captures many songs that that have not been heard other than on rare and bootlegged records. What's really nice is that the band takes time to talk about the songs and has some heartfelt interactions among themselves and the audience. Further, the movie is beautifully shot, and the sound is very good.",1453593600,,336,4.810344827586207
8687495,4,B00PCSVNEM,"I got this from the library and watched it more than once. I was 12 when MTV came to Cleveland and truthfully, Devo had already peaked in popularity from my point of view. This 2014 performance prompted me to read the book written about Devo by Jade Dellinger and David Gifflels. I knew I'd missed part of the story. Essentially, unless you've seen Devo perform live, anything recorded in a studio isn't proof of their dynamic, original, innovative showmanship. Devo left Ohio and recorded a couple of albums. Then, the music that put them over the top successfully wasn't enough to sustain them. Sometimes we forget what made us successful and that doesn't apply here. The 2014 tour was a retrospective of their roots: music that is fun to play. I'm 45 and I would explain Devo to anyone older than me as punk rock. To anyone younger, I'd state that they are New Wave. I find it impossible to be in a bad or serious mood when listening to Devo. While these guys were exposed to serious events like the Kent State shootings and the sinister side to the music business, their subversive (and sometimes low brow) message was carried by a nonsensical, funny score. Playing classic rock covers might impress the ladies but if I were in a band, I'd want to play fun music. It might be something born from experiments with primitive electronic devices from my basement. I had no knowledge of the personalities in the band beyond the ""guy with thick glasses"". As it turns out Mark Mothersbaugh isn't the weirdest guy in the band in my opinion. Jerry Casale is the most irreverant but interesting person I've listened to in while. The interviews juxtaposed throughout are pleasant interruptions. On a road trip, Id rather hear the greatest hits but late at night. Trying to stay awake, I'd rather hear this thought provoking science experiment. To sum them up, Devos talent was undeniable to anyone. At the risk of seeming sexist, the reason this concert audience seems to be 100% male is because of the style of music I suppose.",1450569600,,2021,4.695774647887324
8687496,5,B00PCSVNEM,"It reminds me a great time in my life. Good sound, music and image. A great concert. The blu-ray arrives just in time. Perfect Job. Thank You. Ablio",1450224000,,148,4.321428571428571
8687497,3,B00PCSVNEM,"Stereo???? Only Stereo????? Once in a lifetime concerts in 2014 and stereo only.... bummer.  Retro to the point but if you're going to do it do it right....like Shut Up and Play the Hits by LCD Soundsystem or Talking Heads Stop Making Sense... sound done freakin right.  The one thing I will give them at least they put a selection to allow you to play the concert only.  Thanks.... but can't you ""innovators"" (DEVO)  at least try to provide the best sound for the time??? Please.",1449705600,,480,4.546511627906977
