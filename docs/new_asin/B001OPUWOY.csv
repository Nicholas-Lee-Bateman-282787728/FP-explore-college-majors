8331214,3,B001OPUWOY,"This DVD documentary about the jazz pianist with no peer,Thomas ""Fats""Waller,I would say you could call ""Fats-Lite"".One is LONG overdue,but if you are expecting an in depth look at the man,his music,his career,his influences,you won't find it here. It's a nice refresher course for those Waller vets,but on the whole this one is better geared for those just learning about the man. There are more than a few folks interviewed but even though they post their names, one doesn't have a clue as to what relation they are to Fats,let alone who they are. The clarity of the DVD oft times leaves a LOT to be desired. It looks like it was copied from a so-so VHS tape. There are also no chapter selections at all.
What it DOES offer are some nice little seen movie/soundie clips of Fats doing his ever lovin' thing. Interviewed in the main is Maurice,Fat's son. It's amazing how much he looks like his dad. The documentary does have a slight linear flow to it,but not enough for me. 52 minutes flies by,and just as you really get into it,Maurice is talking about his dad passing away on a train. The documentary then fades out/credits roll with a live recording of Fats singing.
The DVD is a region free disc so it will play on any player worldwide. The playing surface is blue tinged,such as those you get with VOD's(video on demand).
In conclusion this DVD is a great ""Fats-101 ""course for those just learning about him. The Waller vets will find it a bit on the light side. But since there is little to none out there regarding this great musician(and I do not use""great"" lightly),any Fats fan will want to pick this up for their collection.",1425427200,7,1637,4.590443686006826

8331217,5,B001OPUWOY,"This documentary of Fats Waller's professional life is nicely done.  There are a large number of performance numbers taken from various sources.  What is particularly good about this DVD is that most of the performances are intact, not cut up or disturbed by overlaid narrater chatter.  According to the DVD cover there are 14 performance segments.  Listening to Fats is not enough, he is a genuine performer and his face mirrors what he is singing.  The documentary is respectful to his memory and his work.",1315958400,20,508,4.929411764705883

8331219,4,B001OPUWOY,"Fantastic footage of Fats. All the classic old tunes. Can't help but put a smile on your dial or a bounce in your step. Bought it for my dad, but the whole family bopped along to it.",1302566400,12,182,3.945945945945946
8331220,4,B001OPUWOY,"Mit Spannung habe ich die DVD erwartet und wurde nicht entt&auml;uscht! In knapper Form wird die Geschichte dieses grossen Entertainers lebendig erz&auml;hlt und mit Filmausschnitten erg&auml;nzt. Die Leute haben sich M&uuml;he gegeben aus dem historischen Material etwas Gutes zu machen. Entstanden ist ein richtiges Feuerwerk an wunderbarer Unterhaltung, nat&uuml;rlich mit dem etwas in Vergessenheit geratenen Fats am Klavier, richtig in der Stride-Tradition, und seinen guten Begleitmusikern. (Heute w&uuml;rde man dies als All-Star-Gruppe bezeichnen!) Eigentlich warte ich auf eine Fortsetzung dieses Films...",1270944000,3,614,6.592592592592593
