5460229,1,B00ANGICK6,"If you hired some actors of your own for a cheap low budgeter, you might like the results better. These movies were barely watchable and had silent gaps in the sound. Strictly for Linnea Quigley friends and fans only.",1409961600,,217,4.589743589743589
5460230,5,B00ANGICK6,A must for all Linnea Quiqley fans!,1404777600,3,35,4.142857142857143
5460231,2,B00ANGICK6,"These are three ""B"" films that feature the nudity of Linnea Quigley plus two with Michelle Bauer. If you expecting quality ""B"" film like ""Night of the Demons"" don't hold your breath. Only one film was a real horror feature and it was overly campy. These appeared to be direct to DVD from VHS with little to no restoration. The one film had a blue background ""Search Side A -> B"" midway through. They didn't even bother to edit it out, the transfers were done that cheaply. The films all include a commentary option.",1441584000,3,515,4.48936170212766
5460232,4,B00ANGICK6,film quality could have been a little better,1439683200,,44,4.625
5460233,5,B00ANGICK6,"Linnea is by far my favorite ""B"" movie/Scream Queen actress. Her great physical beauty is wonderfully counterpointed by her consistent character presentation as a naive, impulsive young girl. You can believe that she would enter a haunted, ominous, creepy old house and immediately want to strip and take a shower. Jennifer Aniston or Jessica Biel could never pull that off.",1439683200,,374,5.25

5460235,2,B00ANGICK6,"Buy at your own risk! I had several problems viewing this DVD, and it arrived brand new and still sealed. I'll admit the main reason that I purchased this was so that I could have the film, ""Deadly Embrace"" on DVD (I already own a VHS copy). I watched the film with and without the provided commentary track and there were no issues (except for the fact that you could tell that it was recorded from VHS. There are some picture issues related to that format, but nothing major, and it's still nice to have this film on DVD). The next film in the set that I decided to watch was ""Murder Weapon"" since I had never seen it before. Well, I got halfway through when I noticed the first problem. Not having much interest in what I had already seen, I fast-forwarded through most of the rest of the movie and I saw the picture turn completely blue with instructions that are seen on a laserdisc. This is actually pointed out on the commentary track provided with this feature (and is noted in another review here)! OK, then, this is a glitch that is actually supposed to be on the disc. But when I continued to fast-forward, the picture began to freeze and became pixilated (when dots show up on the screen instead of the image that's supposed to be there). This was not normal and is obviously a manufacturer's defect. Having seen most of what I wanted to see of this film, I then decided to watch the third feature ""Nightmare Sisters"" which I already own on DVD. Well, no sooner did I click on the option ""Feature Film"" when the picture began to freeze. That's right, the problem with this feature begins right from the start. I thought I might have better luck viewing the film on this disc if I selected the ""Commentary"" option, but I still encountered the same problem. Furthermore, I was unable to watch the ""Cougar Cult Trailer"" at all (when I clicked on that, nothing happened) which I find really annoying because I wanted to see a preview of that DVD. So, basically, I shelled out over ten bucks for what I thought was a triple feature but turns out to be only one watchable movie, ""Deadly Embrace"". If you want ""Nightmare Sisters"", I'd recommend just buying the DVD with that title. If, for some reason, you must own ""Murder Weapon"" on DVD, then I'd wait until it gets released by another company. Again, as I stated, this item arrived brand new and still sealed. There's no telling how many defective copies there may be out there.",1438473600,3,2436,4.476404494382022
5460236,3,B00ANGICK6,"Three 80 minute movies(time approx).  Bad stories.  Bad acting, especially in Nightmare Sisters.  T and A, but that is what Grindhouse is all about.  The same production crew were in the 3 different movies.  Music by Casio.  Bottom line:  Save your money, rent it if you must.",1436745600,2,276,4.74468085106383

8554729,2,B00ANGICK6,"The first movie ""Deadly Embrace"" had a pretty good story line. Actually there is an unexpected ending. I think the other two were added to make people think they were getting a bargain. To me, not even worth watching.",1465689600,,217,4.589743589743589
8554730,1,B00ANGICK6,"Literally THE most poorly made DVD I've ever seen. Murder Weapon is copied from the laserdisc and there is seriously a part in the movie where the screen turns blue and you see ""A-->B"" because the laserdisc they were copying this from was switching sides! Could they seriously not trim that part out when they edited it?! The movie itself is terrible, 99% of it is just two people talking to each other. There are a couple of gore scenes though which are surprisingly REALLY good (pretty much the only reason I bought this thing). I guess you can't complain much though when you're getting 3 movies for $6",1465171200,,605,4.559633027522936
8554731,3,B00ANGICK6,I would have recommended more but the third movie which looked the best cuts away just after the beginning.  Run out of DVD space?,1456963200,,130,4.416666666666667
8554732,3,B00ANGICK6,Low quality transfers killed this set. Still good due to rarity.,1451433600,,64,4.909090909090909
8554733,5,B00ANGICK6,"Yep, 3 movies, all extremely low budget, and Linnea gets naked multiple times in all of them. Deadly Embrace is my favorite of the 3. Look, you're not buying this for high quality film making and the stories are irrelevant. You're buying this for one reason and that is to see Linnea take it off...and that she does. This delivers on the goods!",1450742400,4,344,4.476190476190476
8554734,4,B00ANGICK6,"Picture quality isn't the best, but its Linnea and that is enough.",1449792000,,66,4.583333333333333
