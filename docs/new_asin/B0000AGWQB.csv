7997049,4,B0000AGWQB,"I enjoyed David Hedison's outstanding performance, and of course, he's a dream to look at.
But, the play was difficult for me to follow. It was supposed to be a comedy and a lot of it was, but I couldn't understand all of it except the story premise about a married woman having an affair (with lover Hedison)while still jealous of her husband's possible infidelity.
I'd say all Hedison fans should buy this dvd, as I said he was wonderful, and had quite a flair for comedy, but the story itself tried to hard and just wasn't very good.",1066953600,3,536,4.424242424242424
