1624274,4,B00005M2FV,"This DBZ DVD, along with Battle Royal, sets up for the final saga, the Buu Saga.  The DVD is full of action and humor and is a most buy for any DBZ fan.  While Goku, Gohan, Vegetta, and the Supreme Kai get ready to fight Babidi and a mysterious man, Android 18, the Mysterious Mask (Goten and Trunks) and Mr. Satan are still competing in the World Tournament.  This is one of the best DBZ tapes out there.",996624000,2,405,4.166666666666667
1624275,5,B00005M2FV,Well now we get into the Babidi saga as Yamu and Spopovitc... have stolen Gohan's energy and are off to see the wizard-well actually they're off to see Babidi and Darbura to give it to them so that Majin Boo may be set free to reign horribly over the world and unleash an evil not known for millions of years-ok so maybe that was over-dramatic but this saga is cool....and those two idiots that stole Gohan's power pat for it to.....sad pathetic losers....just don't let Darbura spit on you.,992995200,13,491,4.52808988764045
7945051,5,B00005M2FV,"Dragon Ball Z is one of the BEST if not The Best animated serial novel from Japanese Animae.  I have watched Dragon Ball Z for almost 20 years and I cannot get enough of it.

The flaws of the characters enable the episodes to be spectacular!

Thank you

7945052,4,B00005M2FV,"If you are DBZ fan this is a must buy. You can't never go wrong with having a collection of the best anime of all time in IMO. Get them while you can, you will not be disappointed.",1375833600,,180,3.763157894736842
7945053,5,B00005M2FV,"I had been waiting for Majin Buu for a while, and I always thought that was the saga after the Cell Games, but I was wrong (by the way, don't look for Buu in this video because he's not in it).  But finally, we hear of Majin Buu!  It was also good that Dabura and Pui Pui could finally show themselves, as well as the Supreme Kai and a host of other cool new characters!  This video contains three episodes, The Wizard's Curse, King of the Demons, and Vegeta Attacks.  I think Vegeta Attacks is the best episode on this tape because it's cool when Vegeta destroys Pui Pui without even trying.  Babidi-Descent is a great DBZ video and I recommend it.",1017532800,,649,4.286885245901639
7945054,3,B00005M2FV,"the start of the babidi saga! and it looks pretty good. goku and the crew head to babidi's spaceship and after kibito is destroyed and piccolo and krillin turned to stone they head down to the spaceship to kick some booty! the reason it gets three stars is because there's no action in the first two episodes, but in the third episode pui pui finds out not to cross the saiyan prince! thank you vegeta! like he said, ""this guy is really annoying"". the expression on the supreme kai and pui pui's faces as vegeta, gohan and goku play rock sissors paper to decide who gets to kick the crud out of pui pui is great!! we also have some good emotion between gohan and videl. buy it.",1017532800,,677,4.296875
7945055,5,B00005M2FV,"There's not much to say about this one, Vegeta is unbelievable!  Great menu and music.  The first of a great saga.",1006387200,,114,4.380952380952381

Im really impressed with this DVD. The menus are fast and easy to use. FUNi even kept in the original TV spots for DBZ. Even in the dubbed version. And you don't have to go through all the trouble of switching languages after each episode. Overall, FUNi's best DVD yet and I hope they continue to do so in the future.

The Z fighters in this film find out that a man named Dabora from the other world of demons is helping babidi.  Vegeta isn't so worried though and even Goku doesn't think he's to tough.  But master Ki isn't so sure of the Super Saiyans power.  He wonders could they be so powerful as to take on Dabura by themselves.  As Goku enters the 2nd level of Babidi's ship.  Master ki wonders how Vegeta Destroyed that last henchman in 10 times gravity ha ha we all know why it was easy so let me just say if you want a good laugh you definetily want this video.,1003363200,,689,4.059259259259259
