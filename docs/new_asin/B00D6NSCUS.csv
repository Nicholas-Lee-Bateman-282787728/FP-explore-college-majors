Even though Dr. Zeisel's ""I'm still here book"" was instrumental in assisting me to understand, interact, and accept my mom this documentary would have provided me with additional skills in interacting  understanding and taking care of my mother with Alzheimer's .  The ""I'm still here book"", played an important role in my research and writing of my new book "" The Gifts of Autism and Alzheimer's"".  His best selling book as well as this informative documentary should be a requirement for any student or agency that works with people with Alzheimer's.  ""I'm still here"" , is my favorite overall book on the subject of Alzheimer's.  Dr. Zeisel's innovative nonpharmacological approaches to treating persons' with Alzheimer's and dementia along with the works of Dr. Peter Whitehouse, and Dr. Gabor Mate is changing the way science, academics and families are perceiving dementia and old age.
