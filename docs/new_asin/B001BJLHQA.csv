8283362,5,B001BJLHQA,"Coach ""K"" shares the insides of his programs, that accelatrated his teams, winning records & championships.  Look, Listen & Learn from this program. Recommend this to serious coaches & basketball players whom want to advance their level in basketball games. Still good information for it time still is in the present. I'd recommend it to Middle & High Schoolers. Win / lose, good / bad calls, it is all about having fun on the courts. Enjoy.",1352851200,,441,4.802631578947368
8283363,1,B001BJLHQA,"while the dvd may be helpful to someone just starting, it glosses over material that just about any coach already knows or can easily obtain in more extensive (and much cheaper) formats including free on-line coaching forums.  Coach K's drill DVD's are much more helpful.",1288915200,2,271,5.022222222222222
8283364,5,B001BJLHQA,"Coach K is a great coach. He is also a great teacher.

This DVD is an excellent tool for coaches to learn how to run a practice, teach skills, reinforce both skills and concepts, and create game-like practices.

The video for this was filmed at Duke in Cameron Indoor Arena using Duke players. You actually witness Coach K coaching and running parts of a practice, putting the concepts in the DVD into actual use.

Even if the offensive and defensive system that you coach are different from Duke, this is a good DVD because the ideas and principles are applicable regardless of the style of play being taught.
