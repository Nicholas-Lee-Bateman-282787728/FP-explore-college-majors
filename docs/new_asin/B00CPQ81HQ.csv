8584624,2,B00CPQ81HQ,"I loved the book, and was expecting the same from this documentary. However, I found it disappointing as a lot of it was focused on personal story of cancer, and not so much on the facts that make a strong case for the link between environmental contamination and cancer. I believe the fight Sandra Steingraber is fighting is extremely important. However, you really need to read her book to feel strongly about it. The movie does not convey the facts well enough, and is based on emotions. Please, read the book, you will not be disappointed.",1484870400,,543,4.666666666666667
8584625,5,B00CPQ81HQ,My husband had been wanting to see this for a long time and I couldn't find it anywhere. I was thrilled to find it! Got it for him for his birthday. Very good documentary.,1431043200,,171,4.0588235294117645
8584626,4,B00CPQ81HQ,"An independent documentary, this is based on the autobiographical book by Sandra Steingraber, a biologist by training who contracts uterine cancer at a rather young age.  Even before that, she had been interested in the effects of the increasing numbers and levels of chemicals in our environment: air, water, food.  That includes, at the least, effects on our reproductive systems and cancer rates [also, I suspect, neurologic problems like the increasing rates of ""ADHD"" and ""autism spectrum"", and likely also contributes to the ""epidemic"" of obesity and type II diabetes.  However those are not the ground this film covers, but the first two items are].

As a legitimate biologist she knows she cannot pin her particular cancer on any one chemical, and not necessarily on any combination of chemicals in the environment.  But the film, like her book I guess, weaves together what scientific evidence we do have, with her own story to form a moving and cautionary tale about how many chemicals we are constantly exposed to without realizing it, the known harmful potential of some of them, and how many thousands of them haven't really been properly researched at all regarding the safety of exposing humans to them from in utero throughout the rest of our life.  A thoughtful ""environmental"" film from an individual's educated and motivated perspective.",1415491200,,1356,5.140909090909091
8584627,5,B00CPQ81HQ,more of this quality please.  a very good supplement to her book by the same title.  a very good documentary summarizing an excellent book.,1393718400,,139,4.75
8584628,5,B00CPQ81HQ,"I read Dr. Steingraber's book twice and I have found it and the video extremely useful in my own research on Lymphoma.  Sandra is a second Rachael Carson and perhaps someday we can connect biomonitoring with  the use of our 8,000 synthetic chemicals.  Thank you so much for this very important research and book.

8584629,4,B00CPQ81HQ,"Living Downstream is the film companion to the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Downstream-An-Ecologist-s-Personal-Investigation-of-Cancer-and-the-Environment/dp/0306818698/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Downstream: An Ecologist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment</a>.  Both center on ecologist Sandra Steingraber; Steingraber was diagnosed with bladder cancer after living a seemingly healthy life.  She investigated how and why she would receive this diagnosis and discovered just how badly the pollution of her area is affecting life (human and nonhuman) around it.  Living Downstream follows Steingraber as she recovers from her cancer and as she travels across North America to advocate against using pollutants for monetary gain at the expense of the environment.

This movie covers a considerable amount of ground -- how pollutants are made, how they travel, how they affect biological organisms, and how scientists observe these results.  For me, the movie's strengths lie more with the more global advocacy of the message rather than the personal story.  Don't get me wrong, Steingraber's tale is truly amazing, but her message has broad implications for the world at large.  Perhaps in the memoir version of Living Downstream, Steingraber has enough time to fully realize her story, but this film hangs around 80 minutes, so there is only so much time that can be divided to this film's diverse array of topics.

This is a good movie, and it's an important one too.  I would recommend this to anyone at all interested in conservation or healthy living.  There's something here for everyone - myself, I particularly enjoyed spending time in the lab with the scientists crunching data - because it's not a hard movie to like.  It propels itself forward very quickly, and by the end, it will certainly have you thinking.  And what else more could you ask for in an advocacy piece like this?  Steingraber et al do a good job presenting the facts, appealing to your emotions, and aspiring for a genuine change.",1375833600,,2092,5.666666666666667
