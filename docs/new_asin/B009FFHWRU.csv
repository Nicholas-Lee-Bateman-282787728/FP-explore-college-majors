5324245,5,B009FFHWRU,"I absolutely cannot say enough good things about the Ballet Beautiful Body Blast. It truly transformed my body in a way I truly didn't think would be possible. Like, obliterated cellulite! Mary Helen Bowers is a genius. I am not a dancer but found the format really easy to follow and the exercises make me feel graceful and totally lean. It is the BEST!",1355270400,126,354,4.546875
5324246,1,B009FFHWRU,"I bought this DVD as a compliment to my pilates, yoga, and Piloga workouts. There are four 15-minute workouts, which I thought was a great feature. But my problem is that the director chose to film Mary Helen in a white leotard against a white background, with the contrast completely faded out. YOU CAN BARELY SEE HER! I have just completed the first section, ""Swan Arms,"" which I'll admit was a great workout, once I finally figured out what she was doing. ""Swan Arms"" offered a great arm workout, but again, you have to strain to see the teacher.  Mary Helen also goes very fast through transitions. For example, after a segment, she brought her arms across her chest for a stretch, but the stretch literally lasted a second before she was onto the other side. I supposed I'll know to expect this the next time, but it felt very rushed. I am exceedingly disappointed in the film style. I don't mind sweating through my workouts--but I don't want to have to squint. Look elsewhere for a ballet workout. Id give this DVD one star, just because the DVD does, in fact, work and the packaging was nice.",1355270400,10,1100,4.555555555555555
5324247,5,B009FFHWRU,"Really good workout DVD for your inner ballerina:)
BB provides a fantastic workout that includes muscles you did not know you had.
It burns - and you can see an improvement pretty fast; so BB keeps the motivation up:)
It is my favourite workout - and I have tried a lot.",1501372800,,270,4.313725490196078
5324248,5,B009FFHWRU,"I've only done this workout for two days, but so far, so good! Intense and fun. She's like a living Ballerina Barbie. I'm definitely sore in the best way possible.",1501027200,,163,4.466666666666667

5324250,5,B009FFHWRU,"I love/hate this workout.

I'm just getting back into the swing of working out, and I've been incorporating both Ballet Beautiful and Barre videos. Both are quite challenging, but this workout takes it to a whole new level for me right now. I assume that this means that this workout is probably the one that I need the most...figures ;-)

I would say that this is probably the most tedious of the BB workouts that I've tried. 15 minutes of swan arms?! I also think that having 2 lower body segments back to back feels looooong. But, I made it through most of the reps (okay, many of the reps), and now I feel amazing.",1498003200,,618,4.3652173913043475
5324251,5,B009FFHWRU,"Before Ballet Beautiful, I already consistently ran, did yoga and rock climbing, and some kettlebell/barbell strength training. I decided to try Mary Helen's methods to improve my posture, and hoped (with skepticism) that I'll get a more long and lean muscle tone.

After the first week of an hour each morning, alternating between Body Blast and Total Body, I was surprised to see my hunched shoulders are already loosening, my upper back and arms are visibly more toned. After 3-4 weeks, my core, hips, and hamstrings are much stronger, which means I could do moves in rock climbing that I was never able to --- stronger back and obliques for twist lock on overhang, deadpoint holds because my core isn't slackening and pulling me off the wall, better rockover and heel/toe hook from stronger hamstring/butt. So surprised that Ballet Beautiful was more effective than all the climbing specific strength training I did in the last couple of years!

Now it's become a habit that I do Ballet Beautiful's Body Blast or Total Body Fitness (plus another 10-20 min from Lazy Dancer Tips on youtube) every morning as my baseline, regardless of whether I'd do something else later in the day. It's still challenging enough that I can't finish most of the 10-15 min routines without taking extra breaks, but it's gentle enough that I don't get sore all over and so can keep it up everyday. I'm still getting stronger, and better shoulder and hip mobility from it.",1495324800,7,1455,4.862903225806452
5324252,5,B009FFHWRU,this the hardest in her series..You should work out other DVD's first and then move to this one..Sculpts bottom in every way if you can make the moves..i love it,1495324800,2,161,4.4
5324253,2,B009FFHWRU,She goes WAY TOO FAST in this video.  I guess it's for those who are training as a ballerina.,1495065600,,93,3.8947368421052633
5324254,5,B009FFHWRU,WOW! She Mary Bowers really makes you work your whole body in this workout. And the workouts don't get old because they are so difficult!,1494374400,,137,4.52
5324255,1,B009FFHWRU,"This is the first and last dvd I'll purchase from Mary Helen Bowers.  First, I can't stand her voice, which seems whiney, or her demeanor - she acts bored and never smiles.  And, this workout is, indeed, boring and repetitive.  Mary Ellen has mastered the knack of putting the ""work"" into ""workout.""  No fun at all!  Secondly, when I'm working out to an exercise dvd, I want to admire the body of the instructor as my role model - I don't admire Mary Ellen's body one bit.  She just looks scrawny and she has No muscle definition.  Her arms are sticks - where are the guns?  As a professional dancer, she must have physical strength, but I like to see that strength in beautifully defined muscles.  I have around 200+ workout dvds, and I workout mostly everyday.  Mary Ellen Bowers is not a good fit for me.",1493164800,,807,4.428571428571429

5324260,5,B009FFHWRU,"Ballet beautiful will kick your butt in the best way! Swan arms seems silly when you start but I began to see new definition in my shoulders within two weeks. There are two butt workouts which are quite difficult for me. I'm still working up to doing all of the reps in each set. The 15 minute total body workout is great for when you're short on time, or maybe throwing in after a cardio session. Overall this is a great program and I've loved it so far!",1484438400,5,455,4.181818181818182
5324261,2,B009FFHWRU,Beautiful clean crisp looking video and video quality. I am not a ballerina however and i messed up my back doing swan arms. Didn't feel it till later on and well that's just my story.,1483920000,2,184,4.285714285714286
5324262,5,B009FFHWRU,"I have worked out with MHB's DVDs for years now and I still do. Piano music is great and soothing, scene is clean, execution is graceful and defined, the workout is tough and gives you solid, visible results: not only in terms of lines, but also as improvement of any ballet/ic routine. My arabesques improved greatly by practicing butt 1 and 2 series more frequently.
If you are no ballet dancer, the reps and sets maybe too many, but stick with it and your body will build lean defined muscles.
If you are advanced, you may still feel the burn and effort. I workout with MHB's DVDs everyday and complement her routines with other DVDs to make up to 14-16h ballet/ic workout per week. I find this DVD a greatly valid routine no matter how long I have been practicing it.

To improve:
1. Sets counting. Here and there while she talks, she forgets the count and you end up training some parts of the body more than the other. I like to resume the DVD and work both parts more and equally. Post-prod had to be more attentive to this.
2. Reps. They are kind of numbing (4 to 5 sets of 8 x each exercise)..it ends up being a counting hour with great music in the background, but I take this is what it takes to get the results I get. It could maybe be interesting to find different exercises to work the same group muscles and share the sets/reps.
2. Noise: several noises and interferences.
3. Instruction. Close to zero - not a big deal for intermediate and advanced. Kind of useful for beginners though
4. Streching. This is rushed in between a set and the other. I would have added a few extra seconds.

Despite these notes, this is a consistent workout I keep in my routine. Do it regularly and you will feel, look and perform better.

I want to give it 5 stars for the results it delivers.",1482105600,3,1791,4.3562874251497
5324263,5,B009FFHWRU,I have only been doing the workout for about 1 month.  I like that it is split into four 15 minute work-outs so I can just do one if I am really pressed for time or 2 or more for a full workout.  Can't speak to results yet as it is still early but I can definitely feel the burn!,1481241600,,279,3.6333333333333333

5324265,5,B009FFHWRU,This video will kick your a**! But that's the point right? I do it everyday and boy do I feel sore but that's what I'm going for. I love the piano music to calm me down while I'm working it hard. Her repetitive movements really work your different areas of the body that I haven't gotten from any other videos. She also has a sweet personality to make it seem like it's not as hard as it really is. It helps to boost your confidence when you make it all the way through 4 sets of 8 reps lol,1478131200,2,490,3.95959595959596
5324266,5,B009FFHWRU,"I am an advanced exerciser, and have done tons of bar methods. This is the only one that stresses keeping your knee taunt and leg stretched out as much as possible. What a difference! This workout is hard. I had to stop and stretch more than she suggested. But after doing this workout several times, it did get easier. She does not work your quads, which I like, since those get overworked and tend to bulk up. I also like that she does arm and leg circles, which helps get rid of cellulite. She made the mistake of missing a couple of exercises on the 2nd butt routine. I just repeat that routine over using my other leg. Also her count is off on one of the arms. I am willing to overlook this for the great exercises from a ballerina. My legs and arms thank you.",1477958400,12,765,4.210884353741497

5324268,4,B009FFHWRU,"A little hokey atmospherically but VERY effective workout. I bulk up so quickly usually but this just feels like getting stronger and tighter, not bigger.

My only complaint is that in a few of the sections there is weird background noise, like someone is moving or dropping equipment in the studio. It is just a bit distracting, but overall very wonderful.",1471564800,,372,4.04054054054054
5324271,5,B009FFHWRU,"I love this DVD!
I use it for cross training in my triathlon training. I train for long distance triathlons, like the half Ironman (1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike ride, 13.1 mile run) and the Ironman (2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride, 26.2 mile run), and use this DVD occasionally for cross training along with the classic DVD. Even though I train regularly and hard for endurance triathlons this ALWAYS kicks my butt and burns like crazy.
The purpose of weigh training and cross training is to strengthen all muscles to prevent injuries. Ballet targets muscles that normally aren't used in ""traditional"" workouts or are hard to target in ""traditional"" workouts. I am honestly convinced that Ballet Beautiful has kept me injury free during grueling workouts and races. This particular DVD has a focus on the butt and legs which are key during the bike and run portion of the triathlon, and swan arms which is great for the swim portion of the triathlon. So this DVD is really great for triathletes in my opinion. Plus it's VERY different from triathlon training, which is nice from time to time! :)

I can't say anything about how it shapes your body or if it helps in weight loss, because I don't use it for that purpose and I don't use it nearly enough to make any kind of difference. I get my body shape, fitness and leanness from triathlon training. That being said, I can easily see how it can do an amazing job at toning and helping in weight loss because it is a great workout every time I do it, and I still get sore from it.",1471132800,11,1531,4.4678571428571425
5324272,5,B009FFHWRU,"This DVD consists of four 15-minute ""mini workouts"" designed to be used as supplements to the ""Total Body/Classic 60-minute Workout.""  All four sections are excellent, but I find the 15-minute full-body one to be the one I use the most.  Whenever I'm too tight on time (or low on energy!) to do the entire Classic DVD, I'll combine the Full-body Blast from this one with the Inner & Outer Thighs from the Classic for a complete workout in just slightly over 30 minutes.  It's the perfect solution for when you're traveling or in need of a quick morning routine.

I should add, these short workouts are VERY intense and definitely not for beginners.  I would highly recommend mastering the original 60-minute workout first before attempting these little ""burners.""",1470873600,4,763,4.9296875

5324278,2,B009FFHWRU,"So here is the deal. The instructor puts the mess in the Hot Mess for the DVD.

Pros: The exercises are great. I love the combinations.

Cons: On the Butt Series Part 2 workout the count is way off not only that but your workout on the right side is not even the same on the left side. The left side also gets a longer workout. I hit rewind on the dvd to the beginning just to make sure. Sure enough the workouts are different.  The pace of the workout is lightning fast this would and is difficult for even the most advanced student( I am a fitness professional). I found myself thinking whoa whoa what is the rush this is a home dvd no need to rush. This DVD workout had such potential if only there were better instruction and a slower pace. I gave it two stars because as I said in the pros the exercises are great I can add them to my workout at the gym.

5324297,5,B009FFHWRU,"I LOVE these workouts!  I know you can get all but one segment of this DVD and the Total Body DVD on the BeFit channel on youtube for free, but I find it helpful to have the actual disc to take with me when I travel and might not have internet.
All of these workouts are extremely difficult while you're doing them, but afterward I feel energized and have been getting TONS more done since I started doing these and Tracy Anderson (currently her Mat and Precision Toning but also have the Post Pregnancy workout in the wings--and I'm not post preg, but the ab workout is supposed to be killer!  See my other reviews for those if interested.)  I feel strong and happy, and  my back doesn't hurt as much (a big thing for me!).  And yeah, my body is starting to look different, even though I haven't yet changed my diet much (next step...  ;-)  )  I have much more curve in my inner thighs, leaner arms, and am starting to get some nice abs.  I'm settling in to a routine now that seems to give me the best results for the time being--I alternate days of Tracy Anderson and Ballet Beautiful, and alternate the workouts as well--so a four day period would be, TA Mat, BB Body Blast, TA Precision Toning, BB Total Body.  I might throw in a short barre workout and I do walking or part of a dance dvd for cardio.
I got really frustrated with working out for a while--I have been a pretty active person all my life but I had to stop running, and it seemed like I'd developed a layer of flab over my still-present muscles that wouldn't go away.  Working out at the gym either made me look bulkier or didn't provide any results at all except to make me hungrier.  These kinds of workouts are a completely different style of exercise than I've ever done, and they are the first thing I've tried that have 1) made me feel leaner and stronger 2) given me more energy 3) made my core stronger and more protected without stressing it 4) been convenient and cheap.

5324315,5,B009FFHWRU,"I bought this DVD and Mary Helen's total body one back when they first came out (I think it was 2011??).  They were my first experience using Mary Helen's workouts, and I just love them. The soothing classical piano music, the lovely white set, and Mary Helen's soft voice make for two workouts that are pleasant -- even while Mary Helen is killing you! These might look easy, but they are tough!

These are not ballet exercises, but more toning/strengthening exercises. All you need to do this workout and the Total Body one is a mat.

The Body Blast DVD includes four fifteen-minute segments: Swan Arms, 15-Minute Total Body Blast, Butt Blast 1, and Butt Blast 2.

Since I've personally found it really hard to do the two Butt Blast segments back-to-back, my big tip is to start with Butt Blast 2, then go back to the main menu and ""Play All"" so that you then do then do Swan Arms, the Total Body Blast, and Butt Blast 1. Doing the workout this way allows my glutes and legs to get a nice break between the two Butt Blast segments so that I can complete the whole workout -- and still walk the next day! ;-)

If you are familiar with Tracey Anderson's workouts, the two Butt Blast segments on the Blasts DVD reminded me a lot of Tracey's Metamorphosis Hipcentric workout, where you work your legs from an all-fours position. I got great results using Tracey's Hipcentric before I had to stop it due to back strain, but because Mary Helen uses slower pacing, her workout seems much easier on my back. I do have some wrist pain when doing these two segments, but Mary Helen says that you can go down to your forearms if you need to.

For each exercises, you will do four sets of eight repetitions. Mary Helen counts each and every rep, which some people might not like, but I've found that it helps me get into the rhythm of the moves. She also repeats the same phrases, and I could see how that might get old after a while.

If you like these, you might also like Leah Sarago's Ballet Body workouts (Ballet Body Signature Series Upper Body Workout, Ballet Body Signature Series Core Body Workout, and Ballet Body Signature Series Lower Body Workout), which are equally challenging, but equally fun.

I've also had really great results recently using these. When I first got them, I didn't do them on a regular basis, but just recently, I was sick and didn't feel like doing any cardio. I only did MHB's two DVDs for about three weeks (with no cardio) -- and my legs and arms really tightened up! I feel like I had better results in just three weeks with MHB's workouts than I did with 42 days of Tracey Anderson's Hipcentric. Mary Helen is like the poor woman's Tracy Anderson! (I realize that the two methods are very different since TA has you changing up your workouts every ten days, but the Ballet Beautiful workouts seem to work better for me!)

I also love how graceful I feel after doing these! I haven't taken a ballet class since I was about five, but I feel like a ballerina doing these!

Also, if you search YouTube, the Be Fit channel has several segments from this and the Total Body DVD on their channel so you can watch them for free and try them out before buying the DVD. :)

In July of this year, Cathe Friedrich (another wonderful instructor who puts out top-notch workout DVDs) published an article in her weekly newsletter, stating that the best exercises for building the glutes without making the thighs/quads bigger are bridges (which Mary Helen does a lot of on her Total Body DVD) and quadruped hip extensions (which are the exercises that Mary Helen does in the two Butt Blast segments on this Blasts DVD). No wonder these workouts help build a nice, round posterior! The article, in case you want to search for it (unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow us to provide links to outside sites in our reviews) is called ""Can You Build Glutes Without Increasing the Size of Your Thighs?"" and it was published on Cathe's website on July 12, 2015.",1445126400,6,3968,4.520223152022315
5324316,3,B009FFHWRU,"Update:  this is a very effective workout in a  frustrating format.  The Swan Arm series helped me quite a bit with toning my arms, and with stretching out a shoulder injury.  The Butt 2 series is hard, because most other workouts do not target the outside of the hips, legs and butt as much as this does.

Still, I wish someone had been thinking about how people actually workout to at-home DVDs.  It would be nice to have a play-all function that skips her chatter at the beginning of each workout, and that lets you pick the option of music-only or music with instruction ONCE.  It is dumb, but I hate having to click 3 times to get the workout going, and then have to forward through her chatter at the beginning of each and every workout.

For all of my whining, this workout does the trick, and you will find yourself quickly toning up if you use it regularly.

Original review:
I found this DVD to be frustrating, because I needed to stop so much.  The Butt 2 workout is particularly challenging for me, as I needed to pause between each set of exercises.  I do believe this would be a very effective workout, but if I don't enjoy it, how much will I end up doing it?

It would have been better with a stretch section that can be added to the end of any of the workouts.  Those quick little stretches just were not enough for me.

I was a little disappointed in this after all of the rave reviews.  I prefer the New York City Ballet DVD to this one.",1444608000,4,1456,4.262773722627737

5324326,4,B009FFHWRU,"I have given this a couple of weeks and my body is transforming and tightening, for sure. Things to know:
- Mary Helen Bowers kind of says the same 3 things over and over. She loosens up a little, personality-wise by the last 15 minute segment.
- The workout, like others have said, is not very dynamic. And there are just very general comments given on form. But they're simple exercises if you have any bit of body awareness. The repetition is what does the trick.
- Consider her pace and number of reps as advanced, though she doesn't say that. When I started I did fewer reps and spent the time stretching while she completed the rest. Very quickly I was able to take more on. Don't get lazy; push yourself to do more each time.
- I don't do the whole thing at once. Because I'd dread it so much. I do segments 2&3 on one day, segments 1&2 on another, all segments on another day, Lastic stretch on another, and other stuff on the other days.
- Her stretching is minimal. Spend time stretching more. I do the Lastics stretch workout.",1440028800,2,1037,4.350515463917525

5324335,5,B009FFHWRU,"This is my fourth review for Ballet Beautiful. Check out my other reviews on her other wonderful DVDs!

Okay, so this is an awesome addition to the BB family. It features four 15-minute workouts that you can mix and match to your heart's content. There's the 15 minute Body Blast, which targets your entire body when you are pressed for time (Or in my case, too lazy to do anything longer than 15 minutes!) There's the Swan Arms, which made me scream out in pain on the first night I tried it, ensuring that my poor dogs will have nightmares for years to come. ;-) Then there's the two Butt Series, one of them targeting the glutes and inner thighs/legs, and the other with glutes and outer thighs/hips. These are all very short but extremely challenging workouts, so don't think you're getting yourself off the hook here just because her workouts are trimmed down to a measly 15 minute; Mary will make darn sure that you will still get a fantastic workout to make you long, lean, slim, and beautifully feminine, just like a real ballerina!

I highly recommend adding this to your other BB workouts. I think my favorite part is definitely the 15-minute Body Blast, because hey, I work, I gotta tend to my husband-to-be, and I got other things to do, and sometimes I am too wiped out to do a 30+ workout. Mary knows that modern women have a lot on their plates, and that is why this DVD was born. Thanks Mary!",1437868800,5,1408,4.474708171206226

I also bought the BB total workout DVD. These 2 are important components in my workout plan. I highly recommend them.

Added: I had to subtract one star due to serious counting problem. Especially in butt 2: the left side and right side are very different.

She doesn't tell you too much about the exercises except when she initially shows you one rep, but the film style is great and you can actually see her doing the movements since it's so close up.

These routines require a lot of strength and some flexibility, but you can work up to doing as many reps as she does even if you can't keep up initially. There are also modifications like not pointing your toes, not taking the movement as far, etc. that can make it more of a beginner workout.
I could keep up with her, but trying to copy her form left me with a burn that let me know muscles were definitely hard at work.

5324356,5,B009FFHWRU,"Let me start by saying I only did the Butt Series, focusing mostly on Series I as the back of my legs and butt are my biggest trouble area. I'm toned from the bellybutton up, but from my hip bone to my knees I'm a flabby, cellulite-ridden mess.

In a nutshell...my problems: droopy/wide/square butt, horrible saddlebags, cellulite and dimples from the top of my butt to the back of my knees. The results: dimples gone, cellulite pretty much obliterated, round and lifted butt. After doing Butt Series I 5x a week for 3 weeks. Insane!! I checked the back of my legs in several mirrors and in all different kinds of lighting because I couldn't believe the cellulite (I'd had since I was 15) was gone.

While I did also do 30-45 minutes of cardio 3-4x/week and was eating sensibly, I have never seen results like this no matter how many butt workout programs and diets I've done. I was a die-hard fan of Brazil Butt Lift, Slim n 6 and Julian Michaels. While I still love them for other reasons, nothing has sucked out the cellulite and lifted my butt like this. The repetition and intention of movement with MHB's butt series shaped my booty quicker than anything I've ever experienced!!

I started and stopped this workout several times over the past couple of years. It was so hard that I quit after a workout or two.

Let me start by saying that I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan and I lost about 35 lbs. using her workouts.  But, along with a lot of the other reviewers, I was ready for something different- something slower paced and just a different approach to working out.  So I read almost all (or maybe even all) the reviews for Ballet Beautiful, and was so motivated to try these workouts!  I started with the Total Body DVD and then added this one and Cardio Fat Burn, and I rotated through them 3 - 4 times per week for 12 weeks, and ..... I GAINED 5 LBS. and my jeans are tighter!!  I am so bummed!!  I know, you're thinking I ate too much, but NO - I REALLY watched what I ate, knowing that there's not a lot of cardio in these workouts so you have to be careful.  Now, from experience, I usually gain a few pounds at first when I start a new workout, but then after a couple weeks, my weight returns to normal.  I kept hoping that would happen but it didn't.  And I'm usually not one to just go by the scale, I'd rather judge my progress by how my clothes (especially jeans) fit, but when my jeans start getting more & more snug, I ain't happy!!   I guess this type of work-out isn't what I should do with my body type.

5324366,5,B009FFHWRU,"I've been doing this workout video 4-6 days per week for two months now and it has totally changed my body. It did for me what other videos-like JM, and strength training could not- long lean muscles without any bulk what so ever.  My arms are long and chiseled now, and for the first time I can recall, I can start to see abs. it is truly amazing. My legs are longer and slimmer and Mr. Lux Mommy says my butt is smaller and firmer too. I have not lost any weight (I was not trying to) but I am smaller overall- my whole body is tighter and more toned than it was two months ago. This work out is not easy and it does not get easier- although I can now keep up with MHB, it is no easier- I still feel the burn every time I do it and I still have a long way to go- especially on the last workout, which for me is definitely the most difficult. Don't get discouraged if it feels impossible the first few times- keep trying- If you do it consistently and maintain a healthy diet, you will totally see amazing results.",1427846400,11,1015,4.0497512437810945
5324367,5,B009FFHWRU,"This workout is hard but I see results! The exercise on all fours (for legs and butts) actually tone my waistline very well too. I am rather in shape but I can't do all the reps without breaking in between, but I don't mind pausing and stretching. Like other reviewers, I think her stretches are way too short. I just pause and stretch for longer. I don't think this workout is for beginners, and it is helpful if you are relatively limb and have good forms, or willing to pause/stop as needed. Otherwise I can see that injuries are very possible!

Update: I still love this workout after using it for quite a while! I keep going back to it. Here are some modifications that may help you get through it:
- Instead of doing all the reps on one side as she does it, I do 2 sets on one leg, and then by 3rd set I would switch to the other leg. This has helped me get through the entire workout!",1427328000,4,891,4.1502890173410405

I have no experience with ballet and she is super fast and doesnt explain anything like she is assuming your familiar with ballet somewhat...however just use her as a guideline and go at your own pace so you don't injure yourself..and after about a week with regular practice your form will have become better.  I like the lean workouts with pulses and swan arms...I hate weights and stomach crunches. I recommend it.

I think you have to be in reasonably good shape to take this on.  Some experience with ballet will be of great help.

You may need to work up to being able to complete part 2 after part 1. Body blast is good also, if you're in a rush.

I like that I don't have to focus on learning moves and just focus on form,  then again, form isn't covered either.  So, effective moves that can be memorized and done anytime you can squeeze it in.  I'm not a dancer, and none of this is too complicated.  If you are more into zumba and rah rah stuff, this is absolutely not for you.

I think the body blast is the most challenging of them all but I find it works best for me to do the second two 15 minute workouts first, then go back to the first two. It is easier on my wrists that way. Also since this one is very challenging for my legs while doing the butt series part 1 and 2, I find it easier to stretch more when needed as she recommends in the beginning.

5324396,5,B009FFHWRU,This is a highly effective workout series. I am so happy to find a workout DVD where the instructor is not yelling and cheering along with extreme fitness music in the background. Mary Helen gently guides you through each exercise as classical ballet music plays in the background. I have been doing 3 segments of 15 minutes 3 nights of the week and I have noticed a considerable difference in the overall toning of my body. Breaking the workout down into 3 segments is an excellent idea because you can chop and change throughout the week. Just as I feel I am at my threshold the 15 minutes is up! The exercises at first glance look simple but as you engage your core and try and lengthen the line of your legs/arms/body you really can feel it. Mary Helen completes the exercises with grace and poise and this spurs me on to keep at it. I highly recommend this DVD!,1412985600,7,866,4.41875
5324397,3,B009FFHWRU,"Liked her first one much better. This is way too fast and the range of movement way too large for those of us used to the intense but stabilized, isometrics of bar work.

5324398,5,B009FFHWRU,"In class, my ballet teachers are constantly making us do crazy-hard physical stuff and exhorting us to make it look effortless.  That's ballet for you: effortless and graceful on the outside; wicked hard and gritty on the inside.

Ms. Bowers' excellent workout video exemplifies this principle.  She offers an array of deceptively simple-looking movements that will set your muscles on fire.  Meanwhile, she remains as placid as a buddha.  That's good, because if it weren't for her attitude of blessed equanimity, you'd probably wonder why she hates you so much and wants to hurt you so badly.

Don't assume, by the way, that just because you're already fit and into exercise that Ms. Bower's workout will be a piece of cake.  It might, but it probably won't.  Ms. Bowers has built her video around finely-targeted exercises that work underutilized muscles and muscle groups to near-exhaustion.  Even if you're fit and an exercise fanatic, this particular workout is likely to target different areas than your current routine -- and that's a good thing!

Even spending three days per week in the ballet studio for the past six months (in addition to riding 14+ miles on the bike on any given day, and much more than that once a month or so and an extensive history of ballet and gymnastics training) hasn't prepared me physically for the effort involved in completing this workout.  The first couple of times through, I definitely left out reps (and occasionally entire sets) here and there.  That surprised me.  I figured I'd be able to keep up from the word ""go.""  I was wrong.

If you push through the pain, though, you'll be rewarded not only with a stronger, fitter body, but also with a sense of accomplishment.  Oh, and endorphins.  Don't forget the shiny, happy endorphins that follow hard physical efforts.

I bought this video specifically for use as a component in a ballet-oriented physical conditioning program outside the studio.  I plan to use it along with the New York City Ballet Workout.  For my purposes, it appears to be a good choice.  I think it's probably also a good option for people who don't dance, but want to add some variety to their catalog of workout routines.

One more thing: this video is definitely marketed towards the ladies, but guys, don't let that stop you (I didn't!).  If your goal is to build functional strength and flexibility, Mary Helen Bowers' Ballet Beautiful Body Blast is a great place to start.

And did I mention the endorphins?",1412208000,17,2484,4.845605700712589

5324409,4,B009FFHWRU,"I should begin this review by prefacing that I've never in my life taken dance classes. I get bored easily by doing the same workouts, so I have a lot of different types of DVDs. Because I have some hula DVDs (Island Girl) that I enjoy, I thought a ballet workout would be a nice change. I like the thought of toning my muscles so they're long and lean, rather than turning to the gym and getting bulkier. I bought this particular DVD based on the reviews and the fact that I wouldn't need a chair- I don't have enough workout space to have a chair in there, though a barre workout would have been nice. I love Mary Helen Bowers- her look, her voice, her vibe. The studio is very relaxing, and I love the classical music. Probably my favorite aspect of this DVD series is that she does the entire workout with you- It always annoys me when I'm doing a workout DVD, and they're walking around, pointing to and talking about their backup instructors. As I've said, I'm not a dancer, so it's nice to see how the moves are actually supposed to be performed, and it makes me feel like a beautiful bird when I'm doing them. Just pretend that you're watching yourself in a mirror, and it'll do wonders for your state of mind :) Swan Arms is my favorite workout on this DVD- It is intense for someone like me unused to lifting weights, but it's doable. I made a goal one night that I was going to get through the workout by doing every single movement even if my arms fell off- I did it (but my arms were sore for seriously the next 3 days)! I like how she counts in sets of 3, reps of 8 (it's different on the leg workouts)-- I like knowing how many I have left so I can summon the strength! I do the Legs1 workout occasionally, but I can never do it all. It's very repetitive, and I find it very hard on my wrists; I drop down to my forearms for part of it, but then it's harder to breathe freely, and I just take more breaks. I'm not strong enough to do the Legs2 workout for very long, but I feel like I could work up to it. I'm torn on the body blast workout, as I like some of the moves that incorporate the abs, but I feel like I'm too heavy to do some of the moves where she lifts her but with her hands. Overall, I feel like it's a good buy and a good challenge.",1409529600,9,2263,4.076233183856503

For someone who is struggling, it would be good to really know approximately when the torture will end!  I preferred her other cardio blast workout.  This one is just toning.  The other had a bit of cardio plus toning and the cuing was much easier to follow.  I tried doing the entire video but could only get through the first three sections.

If you need the Backstreet Boys-esque dance moves and loud thumping music to keep you motivated, you probably will find this too repetitive and boring- it's just a matter of taste. But if you're like me and need a calm, yet toning work out that uses essentially no props, you'll enjoy Mary Helen's videos.

Everything looks deceptively simple. ""Psh, I can wave my arms around like that for DAYS, no problem."" And then, after 30 seconds of waving your arms like a swan (or a drowning swimmer in my case), your biceps feel they're going to explode.

I can make it halfway through the third section but then I need a decent break/stretch. It's pretty killer. Go easy on yourself and don't feel like you have to do all of the reps. Let's be honest, if you're a newbie like me, you physically won't be able to, even if you want to. Just do as many as you can and stretch often.

She does stretch pretty quickly and jump into the next workout, and she says the same phrases over and over again like, ""Take a minute, grab a sip of water."" It doesn't bother me though, once I start the workout I get into the flow of it all.

Now I wake up in the morning, roll down my mat in front of the TV, and alternate between the body blast and full body dvds. I'm sore everywhere and feel more in tune with my posture throughout the day.",1407888000,21,1520,4.263888888888889

5324421,5,B009FFHWRU,"This is the best exercise ever! I lost 5 lbs the 1st week doing her DVD. Then I bought this book and it is excellent. Mary explains how Beautiful Ballet came to be, and she inspires you to keep exercising and eating better. The exercises are explained with photos (black and white-I wish it was color), and tells u how many repetitions and sets to do. It helps me to better position myself when doing the DVD. Also towards the end there are some recipes (have not tried then yet) and a bit on nutrition and the things Mary eats to keep her body healthy, strong, and lean. I'm hooked on Ballet Beautiful and it's the best thing I've done for my body. Book is worth the money. By the way, I'm 41, 5'2 and have been very overweight all my life.

I like the long lean muscle tone as oppose to bulky muscles from weight training. Also, most of the exercise in on the floor which is good for me also cause I am still very weak from being so sick for so long. The Swan Arms exercise is great and a real good workout for the arms without the need of hand weights. Highly recommend it.

5324428,3,B009FFHWRU,"I would love to give a higher rating for this, because it IS a very challenging and useful workout...however...it is missing two key components in my opinion.  One, there is not a long enough stretch break in between these sets - part of what makes you long and lean is ample stretching between the workout and you barely get ONE breath in any stretch pose.  I find I have to pause the dvd, give myself a real stretch, and then resume with the unbelievably painful exercises.  The other issue I have is the repetition and lack of real instruction.  It's hard sometimes because of the camera angle to see exactly how her legs or arms are positioned so you aren't sure if you are doing it right.  That can be remedied just by doing the routine enough to know it, but more guidance wouldn't hurt.  She could spend less time counting every single rep and more time telling you how to position or where you should feel the burn.  And doing 5 sets of each exercise gets tedious and damn near impossible.  I consider myself nearly advanced in working out and after three sets, I can barely move the muscle anymore.  It would be nice to do three sets of each exercise to avoid cramping/tedium.  BUT, if you can stick it out, you will probably get the body you want. I plan to use this and light cardio over the next 30 days to see what kind of difference it makes!  I have 15 lbs of baby weight to drop and want my muscle tone back.

When I got her first video, I told every sing one of my friends they needed to try it and I still say that about every one of her videos.  I can't wait for the next one!!

5324434,5,B009FFHWRU,"Wow! I am so glad I found this workout: I LOVE it! I love the aesthetics -- the clean, calm visual design, and the gracefulness of the moves -- and I also love how the soothing classical music and the calmness of the presenter complements the balletic movements and somehow it all motivate me to continue despite burning muscles. Another thing I like about it is that it doesn't require equipment. As a regular exerciser (mainly heavy weight training, running and super-intense plyometric interval training) I thought this was going to be far too easy for me but it is actually much tougher than it looks, and I will definitely be adding this to my rotation. There is something very appealing about this combination of peaceful, soothing, graceful calmness... and burning muscles. It makes a lovely change from the pounding music and the loudly-expressed, energetic urging of many workout videos. (I like those too, but aren't there times or moods when something soothing yet tough yet calm is perfect?)

Someone mentioned repetition. Interestingly enough, what I hate most of all in workout videos is repetition, yet I do not find this video repetitive. It is true that the arm workout is indeed 15 minutes of various kinds of waving arm movements, but somehow that does not feel like the kind of repetition I dislike. What makes me heart sink in terms of repetition on a workout video is when you do a set of several different exercises and then repeat the whole sequence one or more times. For example, if instead of the 15 minutes of arm waving (which put like that really does sound boring and repetitive, I agree!) she had done 1 minute of 5 different things and then repeated the set 3 times, I think that might help felt repetitive. I mention this not because I think everyone is likely to feel the same way, but just to mention that despite my loathing for repeated groups of exercises in workout videos, I myself do not find this one repetitive. I hope this helps!",1405382400,7,1974,4.705202312138728

5324436,5,B009FFHWRU,"Wow.  This workout is so hard.  I've been doing it for about 6 weeks now, 1-2 times per week, and I still can't keep up!  But I can certainly do much more then when I started, and I am starting to get some great results, especially in my arms and hips.  Even the instructor Mary Helen gets tired and admits she is having to push herself.  The first time I did this workout I got so irritated because I felt like she was torturing me!  Plus, she says things like ""Almost there!"" but you still have like 10 more reps! But if you keep it up your body really starts to improve.

I would recommend this for anyone who wants to add some cross training to target those muscle groups that get missed in normal workouts.  It's also great for anyone who wants to increase stamina.  While I still can't get through all the reps she does, I have been recently seeing a difference in my running, especially on hills.

IMPORTANT: I'm pretty sure section 4 is imbalanced.  She stays on one leg for a really long time, and doesn't do all the same reps on the other side.  No biggie, you just learn to switch to the other leg sooner. But if you're screaming at the TV because she keeps going back to your leg that's about to fall off, just know that the other side won't last as long.",1404950400,3,1267,4.211618257261411

The two butt series, when done together and exactly as she is doing them (no cheating!) are also quite intense.  You will feel the burn after doing this video.  My one complaint is that the breaks that she takes during each workout are way too quick; she whips herself into and out of the stretches before I've even gotten down onto the mat. And she wants me to take a sip of water during these breaks, too!  Unless you're already ballet beautiful, it's tough to keep up with her.

5324440,5,B009FFHWRU,"I have the earlier version of this (Ballet Beautiful Blast Series) but from what I read here, it looks like the same thing.
First of all, it is wonderful that you pop the DVD in and it starts right away! No annoying fifteen minutes of blah blah blah explanation/introduction to either sit through or fast-forward through. I am overweight and sedentary and wanting to get back into shape and gain stamina. I like it that each series is only 15 minutes long. I started on the first one- the Swan Arms series, and couldn't make it through the whole thing. BURN. With that much burning, it must be working! Hopefully in the future it will take care of that nasty underarm jiggle. Tomorrow I will do every other set, which I recommend to other out-of-shape beginners like myself, and hope that I can get through the whole thing. I also did about half of the first Butt series. But I did watch the entire DVD and feel confident that it will keep my interest long enough that i can work up to doing the whole thing.
I look nothing like a ballerina at this point. So I'll keep you posted.
I love the music- calm, in the background, a nice compliment to the exercises.  Mary Helen Bowers has the perfect approach. Not aloof, but also not in-your-face perky (ugh). She says what needs to be said, period, no extraneous chit chat that gets old after you've heard it ten times.
One thing I would recommend just for mental reasons- if you have ballet slippers and a leotard- wear them while you work out! Yes, this work out can easily be done in sweat pants and barefoot, but wearing the right gear will help you get into the mood.

Okay....I did the above work-out on Tuesday. On Wednesday I was pretty sore. On THURSDAY I could barely life my arms over my head and was miserable! So if you are really out-of-shape, like I am, TAKE IT SLOW!!! Maybe the first few times you do it- only do half of the exercises, and when it starts burning, don't push it.

I would encourage anyone to give it a try. I can't wait till I'm strong enough to do all four sections together, but it certainly isn't necessary to see or feel results.",1404086400,3,478,4.382022471910112

I did it them a couple times a week, along with my other regular videos (more focused on lifting actual weights) and treadmill interval workouts. I mainly did the Total Body one. It seemed fine. Eventually, I kind of stopped doing them.

Then, because I was bored and frustrated with lack of results, I re-read people's reviews on here about the BB videos and was motivated to start them again. Except this time, like other people suggested, I did them (and only them) every day. I have really used this specific one a lot. I like that I can make a 30- or 45-minute routine to fit I to my busy mornings (an hour is just not always possible). Because the 4 workouts are only 15 minutes each, they are VERY intense, which I really like. My new routine has been: 1 run/week - I love the way it makes me feel. BB workouts 4-5 times/week. I do what I have time for. Maybe 1 total body, 1 cardio blast, and then some combo from this DVD. I am AMAZED at how different my body is starting to look. And it's only been 2 weeks. I can't wait to keep it up and see how things progress.  This is the absolute best set of videos for getting super strong, tight, but lean muscles. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, but stress that you really need to do it most days of the week, and don't mix in other types of exercise. Otherwise, your results won't be the same.

Soon after I couldn't do anything on Insanity! Every move made me feel like I was going to pass out, and although I was eating healthy, I was no longer counting calories.

That's it.  Sure it's intense, but any movement repeated like that will cause fatigue in your muscles.  There's no ballet here.

5324465,5,B009FFHWRU,"The four workouts provided are as follows: Swan Arms, Body Blast, and Butt Series (Part 1 & 2). And maaaaan do these babies work. I love how elegant the swan arms, but they are killer. Same goes for the Butt Series-I've never had my legs and rear cramp as much while doing these types of exercises, but I love them. I know I'm really working even though I'm not pouring with sweat-which I like a LOT. And I love how you can mix and match these, or you can do 'em all. I definitely recommend.",1398038400,,491,4.178947368421053
5324466,4,B009FFHWRU,These are four awesome workouts that are great to do together or separately if you only have 15 minutes. Ballet Beautiful is an amazing workout and you actually see and feel results fast!  My only complaint (and I don't think they can fix it) is that you have to fast forward to get to the segment you want instead of having the convenience of chapter selection.  Good thing swan arms are first!,1397520000,,395,4.472222222222222
5324467,5,B009FFHWRU,Great workout! I workout regularly and was surprised at the intensity of it. Mary Helen Bowers is extremely likable and a great coach. Great purchase!,1397347200,,150,5.04
5324468,5,B009FFHWRU,"All I have to write regarding this workout is that lovely Mary Helen Bowers means business.  If this workout doesn't get you in tip top toned shape, nothing will.  The calm music and background along with Mary Helen's soft yet wise voice help you attain what matters: concentrating on the tough and effective workout.  Don't be fooled, it's a killer.  The other great thing is that you need absolutely nothing but a matt and water to keep you hydrated.
I do however, recommend to combine it with some form of cardio since this is more of a toning and re-shaping workout.  Stick to it and you will definitely see and feel an incredible change without bulky heavy weights.  Fantastic!",1397174400,,682,4.689075630252101
5324469,5,B009FFHWRU,Very good workout that makes cardio seem easy.  Would recommend to anyone looking to tone without the use of weights.,1397001600,,117,4.85
5324470,5,B009FFHWRU,"I recently rediscovered MHB/Ballet Beautiful and I'm so glad I did! I had the total body workout DVD for about a year. I had done it a few times, but felt that it just wasn't enough, and spent time and money doing bar method (going to a local studio) and other DVDs. I also mix in other things: running, spinning, Insanity, T25, etc.
Back in December I decided to give Ballet Beautiful a try again and something just clicked! I ended up buying all of her other DVDs, spent the month of January doing JUST her DVDs and lost inches everywhere! There is something in the way her exercises are designed that make them just work!
Since then, I've started an intense kettlebell program (yes, I know, I am all over the map!!), which I love, but still do 2-4 days of BB each week! This one is one of mya favorites - it really targets the butt and tones!
Again - I have done every workout under the sun, have done the dripping sweat, high intensity, yoga, etc. and I will admit my first reaction was that this was just nothing to get excited about, but they really do work!",1396569600,5,1064,4.298507462686567
5324471,4,B009FFHWRU,This workout was harder than I expected. My arms and core were burning only after a minute or two and I had 13 minutes left! This video is more toning and building muscle not cardio.,1396396800,,182,4.228571428571429
5324472,5,B009FFHWRU,This is a great home workout.  I have had this DVD for almost a month and still have to modify some of the exercises because of the advanced techniques.,1396310400,,152,4.241379310344827
5324473,3,B009FFHWRU,"This video has a great intent.  I like to use it as an alternative to traditional barre workouts.  This is more lengthening for sure.

However, if you have tight thighs like me you'll notice that the instructions seldom address those who lack the stretchy muscles of Mary Helen.  I am athletic, so I am body-aware and was able to make adjustments.  I would have also appreciated an occasional clarification on the angle of some of her leg poses.  It was difficult to tell if she was extending 60 degrees or 90 degrees from her hip joint.  I overcame this by doing what seemed to work best for me... but I might not have been ""playing to my edge"".",1396224000,2,646,4.423728813559322

5324475,2,B009FFHWRU,I didn't care for this dvd because it wasn't what I expected.  If you don't mind repetitious moves that go on and on you might like it but I wanted something with more variety.,1395619200,2,176,4.176470588235294
5324476,4,B009FFHWRU,I really liked the workout. I was very sore after. and have done it several times.  My daughter loves it too,1395273600,,108,4.142857142857143
5324477,2,B009FFHWRU,"Pros: The music is nice and relaxing compared to the upbeat/intense stuff I'm used to.

Cons: Stretches are too short.  What I mean by short is 1-2 seconds, or enough to ""pulse"" a few times.  It's ridiculous.  Stretching is so important, I had to pause to actually get a good 10 second stretch in.

In butt workout 1, you are on your hands and knees basically doing a back leg lift (can you picture it?).  Now repeat VERY similar back leg lift movements (just higher or lower) 8 reps x 4 times x 8 different leg lifts = 128 leg lifts..... on the same leg without switching!!!!!!!!.... with almost no break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was so impossible that the instructor (perfect ballerina body) said ""I am getting tired and shaky"" half way through.

That about sums up all the workouts.  The same movement, over and over, for 15 minutes.  Not only is it boring, if she switched it up a little I would actually be able to do it.

5324483,5,B009FFHWRU,"I think I might marginally prefer the Ballet Beautiful Classic 60 min workout to this one (especially since you can make it shorter if needed), but this one is still also a great workout and good for when you need a change from the Classic 60 min workout.  I especially like the first 15 min section, since it gives you a full-body workout in a short amount of time.  It's great for when you're traveling.",1394064000,3,405,4.386666666666667
5324484,4,B009FFHWRU,I did the first two 15 minute workouts for the first time yesterday. I really enjoyed them and can tell today that I worked out those muscles. I  find Mary Helen's voice and presentation very relaxing. The main reason I'm only giving it four stars is because my heart rate wasn't raised much and I did not sweat like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I'm a 42-year-old who works out 30-40 minutes at the gym 6 days a week.,1393718400,,427,4.3375
5324485,4,B009FFHWRU,"It is a very good workout, and  left me very sore. Can't wait to try other videos by the same instructor.",1393632000,,105,4.0
5324486,3,B009FFHWRU,"I bought 3 of her DVD's. Based on the good reviews & not knowing which one would be right for me. I did the 'classic' one & it was hard... but this one is ridiculously difficult. I used to be in excellent shape, yoga, dance I can still jog for miles... but I am over weight. I got ill and lost focus now I need to lose 40 pounds. This DVD offers NO modification for over weight and out of shape people. That is my main problem. I had to modify it myself & I shouldn't have to. She should have other people in her class of different levels. She takes for granted that she can do these with out feeling fat, tired or clumsy.
I am going to use this but honestly it is so intense I feel shaky and like I am going to throw up. After that feeling subsides I feel incredibly energetic and invigorated. Something is happening. My lower calf achilles heel is toning up fast.
 Classic has better work outs for inner thighs. Blast has some same moves but longer sets so longer more concentrated focus, and bigger, more range /angles. This is classic on steroids.  I sweat more with this one. I think classic is better for beginners as an introduction to her method. I have ADD and the classic segments are 10mins vs the 15 mins of these tediously long intense segments. (It seems long because you are doing essentially the same move for 15 mins straight. Ouch!) So if you are wondering which to do, or buy first get the total body classic one first. Her calves are so lean they are freaky looking... in fact she is freakishly toned almost alien looking. It is very inspiring actually because you think to yourself I just want to look 2/3 that toned. I plan on getting her book you can read a few pages here on Amazon... it is fascinating how she developed this method & why. She had injuries and could not dance, she got out of shape and chubby and this is her secret for maintaining the strength and tone she needed to return to her ballet body without dancing because she could not dance while trying to heal!!! She also has an eating plan, and I do think she is a genius for creating this for other women. But she needs new DVD's with modifications to help newbies make better progress. I refused to work out the way she wants you to... constantly on one side. I pause it and do my other side then press play, and pause to do my other side etc. Swan arms is fun if you dance around the house while doing it... I finished all the way through laughing/crying at myself but I finished it! My kids were laughing at me but I did it! The arms was better then classic arms, butt focus was crazy in this one she has TWO blast dedicated to it.  The other two blasts were arms, and full body. If you have problem arms get this!!! But it does not have inner leg focus like classic does. And I have really chubby inner thighs so I need classic. I also have the cardio but have not tried it yet going to break it in Monday, March 3,2014 & write a review right after. I think I will mix and match different segments of both DVD's to create the best custom work out for my body's needs. I am hoping I find something useful to implement with the cardio DVD as well. In her book she says you'll see results in 7 days, and in two weeks your silhouette will be different & your shape will be different! I have excellent memory and have already memorized the classic after doing it twice. I plan on giving updates every week on here to help others and I will post before and after photos in 30 days. At the end of March, 2014. I am excited... do this workout to the best of your ability. Modify it!!!",1393632000,5,3572,4.204081632653061

Swan Arms is kind of boring, but my shoulders are still sore, 48 hours later. It's amazing how something so simple can be so incredibly humbling (I had to take wee pauses). The second section was really hard too.  It's amazing how many muscles she hits in such a short time. I had to take breaks in this section too, but am hoping with repeated ""blasting"" I'll be able to do it straight through.

Minus one star for her ridiculously fast stretching breaks. Seriously, taking 6 seconds to do 4 different stretches is not stretching.",1393459200,2,615,4.572727272727272

It helps get rid of the saddle bags and really tones up the back of the thigh.  I love that you can pick what workout.  Each workout is 15 min so you can have a short workout or up to an hour with this.  I use this a lot when i only have 15 min to workout.  15 min and you can feel it and have a great workout.  Love it!!!,1392336000,5,478,3.6176470588235294

I like these, but I'll do the butt series once a week.  I alternate with BB : Total Body Workout.  My favorite from this dvd is the Swan Arms.  Man they hurt!!!  This series will give you beautiful ballerina arms and now I'm finally getting used to swan arms.  The 15 min total body workout is great for traveling or when you don't have time and really targets every part of body.  Great dvd and another essential for any woman who wants long, lean feminine body.

this is rather calm.  It focuses on muscles that sometimes get over looked in some types of work outs.
It wants those ""long"" lean ""ballet"" muscles, instead of the bulky weight lifting, muscles.  I do not have a ballet body, but  I liked the idea of focusing on muscles I haven't focused on before.  It did give a better shape, especially to my arms, and I was more flexible and I could not finish the workout with out pausing when I started and was able to progress.

A high energy workout videos to me tend to get repetitive, with repeat viewings, this one did not which is why I gave it 5 stars,  I learned the moves and would 'race' her through the video.

This deceptively simple work out video portends to be nothing more than just that - a simple work out video. Take heed, friend. This is the BODY BLAST, a label that should not be taken lightly. Proceed with caution. And be prepared to not only navel gaze, but check out your firm ass as well.",1391385600,26,652,4.371900826446281
5324505,5,B009FFHWRU,"I ordered this DVD and 'Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout' at the same time. I'd recommend starting with 'Total Body Workout' and then moving on to the 'Body Blast'. Why? Because the TBW DVD has SHORTER SEGMENTS. I was starting off with this one and reduced to a whining pile of mush on my exercise mat in less than 4 minutes out of the 15 minute selections.

The other reviewers who had mentioned that they thought they were in pretty good shape before trying these DVDs, they exactly described my experience. I'm almost 40, have done some 5K runs, hike and run on a regular basis, have consistently worked out with other fitness DVDs at least 4 to 5 times per week- none of that prepared me for Mary Helen Bowers. However, remember- stick with it- do the best you can, and after maybe 3 or 4 tries, you'll be keeping up a little better, doing more reps, etc.

For example, the Swan Arms segment- this is a great arm workout which doesn't require any equipment at all. At first, you think 'hmm- I'm just sort of standing still and moving my arms up and down here- how hard could this be?' After about 5 minutes of this, I was watching the counter on my DVD player thinking 'oh no- when are we going to get to 15 minutes?? HELP!"" Haha :)

I'd recommend both this and the Total Body Workout- but you might not want to hop directly in to either one if you are a green beginner with no fitness experience whatsoever.",1391385600,2,1416,4.356060606060606

MHB is a machine. Swan Arms over 60 times until your arms feel like they'll fall off.  It seems to work the entire arm and I mostly feel it in my shoulders. I like the 15 minute blast, too, because I felt it in my abs the next day. Haven't done any of the Butt sequence because of injury so can't comment on that.

There's not a lot of instruction but for counting down. Music is classical barely there background. Because sequences are short, its perfect for travel. I've made this one of my staple DVD workouts.",1390176000,,582,4.420560747663552
5324515,3,B009FFHWRU,"This workout uses many of the exercises dancers use to build strength, so if interested in building strength for becoming a dancer, I would implement this in your workout.

However, as a person who loves intense workouts, and found P90X and Insanity to be a joy, I like those exercises over this one for intense results because of the way they structure the exercises. They really work the muscles, but they vary the exercises to make it interesting and intense at the same time. On the other hand, Ballet Beautiful just uses high repetitions with the same exercises, making it sometimes unbearably tough due to muscle exhaustion, and so boring I was yawning, specifically during the swan series. The breaks for stretching are rushed, not giving the muscles enough time to rest, so that more repetitions can be achieved.

Being that Mary Bowers is a dancer, she has the creativity to implement many of the moves that build strength in the classes into the DVD, so I have no idea why she did not.",1390089600,2,995,4.712643678160919

5324517,5,B009FFHWRU,"A few years ago I started on a lifestyle change in my diet. I have lost a significant amount of weight in the last few years, but without the exercise... just the change in diet. But we need to exercise for overall health. As I'm getting older I'm realizing that exercise is very important, but my problem is I get bored too easily. I've heard many great things about ballet for muscle toning, which is what I need more than weight loss. I can definitely see this happening with the help of this video.

This workout is good for anyone. I don't believe you need to be a dancer to gain the full benefits of this workout. I must admit I had to take many breaks throughout this workout, but again I hadn't worked out in a good couple of years so I was expecting this. I also like how this video is broken down in 4 fifteen minute segments so you can choose to do all four which is an hour of working out, or pick and choose which segment to concentrate on any particular day. It starts off with a segment for arms, second segment is upper body and abs, and the last two segments is lower body and butt.

When you're first watching this video you would think it looks too easy and won't help tone the body, but once you start you'll realize that this is not true. I definitely felt the burn even in the first 5 minutes of it. I've also noticed it helping with my posture. I tend to stand and sit up straighter now rather than slouching which was a big problem I had working behind a computer desk for a good majority of my day.",1389830400,,1523,4.1768707482993195

CONS:
1) She does the same move for 15 minutes resulting in boring repetitions
2) She doesn't teach you anything. You are supposed to know how to be a ballerina by now, i guess
3) She puts her leg behind her head at some point. Don't think a regular person could do that.
4) Music doesn't go with her moves. I don't mind it being classical ballet music, but they could've picked something that went with the rhythm of her moves.

5324528,5,B009FFHWRU,"This was the first video of Mary Helen Bowers that I have used and still love!  I had been exercising at the gym and running and then doing lots of Jillian Michael's videos. I am in my late 40's and one thing I have noticed with my workouts and with other women my age is that it seems to shift us more to bulk up--I have a real tendency to do this.  While my husband loses weight with exercise, I put on weight with muscle, which is really not the look I am going for.  The Ballet Beautiful series has been great at lengthening and toning my muscles--my husband has even noticed and commented frequently!

I must admit that this can be at times excruciatingly hard, all while she is just smiling away doing leg lifts.  The workouts look like a joke--they remind me of ones Joan Crawford would do in The Women-but they are harder than most. For instance the Swan Arms look like you are just playing around and by the end you are burning! I find that I do better sometimes in this series by stopping the tape and doing extra stretches--especially with the outter leg series as I have had troubles with my hip.  I also want to say that these workouts have really helped me with knee and hip injuries I have gotten from running.

I love this workout and have become addicted to it. The music is sort of meditative, as is her demeanor. I have been recommending it to all of my friends, especially those who like Pilates.  I also love that I can just do them for free (all you need is a mat and for some weights) on my own time and that each video can be broken down into 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour workouts depending on how much time you have.  They are great for travel, which I do a lot of.  I also am reminded of my ballet classes as a teen and it makes me want to improve my posture and form.

5324529,1,B009FFHWRU,"I was so excited to get this exercise DVD but was disappointed when I tried it.  It is definitely made for someone who always knows and practices ballet.  If your flexibility needs a little help, like mine does, you will not get any stretching or conditioning in this.  She starches so fast between each rep...like for a few seconds and then moves on.  You could very much injure yourself if you attempt to keep up with her speed and you are not already a conditioned dancer.  I really wanted a workout that would condition me like a dancer but give me levels so I could work up to being advanced.  Gave it a couple shots and never used it again.  I can see it being good for women who already have a dancer conditioned body :(",1387843200,6,727,4.301470588235294
5324530,3,B009FFHWRU,I found parts of this workout almost impossible. I do not have a dancing background and am certainly by no means as flexible as the instructor. The workout is divided into 3 sections I believe and the first section is the for upper body. That is the section I have been using which I find very challenging but quite beneficial. There are no weights used and your arms are totally exhausted by the end of the 15 minutes. The second two sections are for lower body and then core work. I found the core work too difficult int that it involves alot of holding positions that because of past hernias I dare not do. The piano music is pleasant as is the instructors demeanor.,1387756800,,669,4.403225806451613

5324536,5,B009FFHWRU,"Ballet Beautiful is the first barre based workout I've tried....and I'm loving it! There are many reasons why I've enjoyed adding Ballet Beautiful to my workout routine. 1) It is HIGHLY effective - This is really the one factor I focus on when evaluating a workout. And Ballet Beautiful really helped me develop the strength and muscle tone I'm looking for. 2) The movesments are simple, but CHALLENGING - You don't need to be super coordinated to do these toning moves, which is great for me (I can be a klutz occasionally). But at the same time, they make your muscles burn like crazy! It just shows you that some of the exercise we do everyday ignore the tiny muscles in our bodies. Once we strengthen and tone those muscles, we will see a change. 3) FEW equipments needed - All you need is a yoga mat (or something simliar). No weights and no bands. I will say that as I get stronger, I will consider adding in ankle bands for the leg portion of the workout, but they are completely optional! 4) CALMING instructor - I adore Mary Helen Bowers. I feel like we can be best friends. She has a very sweet personality and is not intimidating at all. However, she keeps me motivated through her counting and words of encouragement. She's definitely one of my favorite trainers.

I've bought 3 Ballet Beautiful DVD so far (the body blast, the full body workout, and the cardio fat burn) and have been doing them ~3x a week (60 minutes each time). On alternating days, I incorporate cardio and stretching routines. I think if I have the time to do Ballet Beautiful 5x a week, I will see even faster results. However, I do lead a pretty busy life and I also like to diversify my workouts. Boredom is something I try to avoid since I want to enjoy  exercising and I know if I do one thing over and over again, I will start to hate it. So I'm pretty happy with the routine I set for myself.

Overall, I highly recommend Ballet Beautiful. It's really suitable for all ages (since it's low impact). My advice for ladies/gentlemen with back problems is perhap a small pillow underneath the lower back when doing the ab exercises. I learned this from Physique 57.

It was, on some levels.  I found the most difficult segments of the workout to be the two last ones, the ones targeting the buttocks & legs.  My wrists were sore and tired afterwards, since you are on all fours the entire duration (if I recall correctly).

In my humble opinion, this dvd is the most difficult of the 4.  Can't wait to be able to succesfully conquer this beast!",1386720000,4,546,4.346534653465347

After some rotator cuff issues, I had to give up power yoga and converted to a barre addicted. I do a lot of Barre3 workouts and mix in some physique 57 and Exhale DVDs. The Ballet Beautiful DVDs, in my opinion, are much harder than the barre workouts I do. This DVD was a great mix of lower body segments (2- fifteen minute series), which I love, and full body. I don't see how you could be disappointed, unless you are going for a full on cardio sweat session.  She does some amazing toning moves and I was hurting after 1 series.

5324540,5,B009FFHWRU,"I own this DVD in addition to the Ballet Beautiful Total Body Workout one, and I will say up front that I use this one a lot more, simply because I can complete a single workout with this DVD (albeit with difficulty) and I have yet to make it through the entire 60-minute workout on the other DVD.  These workouts are NOT easy.  The ones on this DVD are about 15-minutes each, and each targets different areas.  Keep in mind--unless you are in amazing shape, it will take you longer than 15 minutes to complete each one because you'll be taking frequent short breaks--I like to pause every time she starts stretching so I can stretch a bit longer than she does and take a walk around the room, have some water, etc.  She recommends that you do this, so don't think that you aren't getting as much out of the workout by taking breaks.  I especially love the Swan Arms blast--I get a serious burn every time, I feel so graceful, and my posture has started to noticeably improve.  I've also noticed that in addition to my initial weight loss of five pounds (in the two weeks since I started doing this workout), my back has gotten slightly more toned by doing Swan Arms.  I'm so happy with this series.  I now own all her DVD's and have preordered the next one coming out.  You will LOVE this series so much.

While I want to look long and lean, I do want to have a wee bit of bulk at least on my arms. On my legs, however, I want zero bulk on my thighs so this is great.

I've done so many butt and thigh workouts and this is by far the most challenging. I'm in pretty good shape and I have to stop it mid-series to relieve the burn. The results show up quickly, but this is more for people who are already thin and looking to sculpt - I can't say I would recommend this for those looking to lose weight.

5324544,5,B009FFHWRU,"Full disclosure, I am a Bar Method junkie.  I can't live without it.  Like it or not, everything else I try will inevitably be compared to BM.  I randomly ran across a few short clips of the Ballet Beautiful workouts somewhere on the internet and liked what I saw, so I bought them thinking I could switch off here and there with my beloved BM DVD's.  That's exactly what I've been doing.  Here's my thoughts:

Pros:
*Mary Helen Bowers is a wonderful instructor.  So pleasant to listen to and not annoying in any way, shape or form (as some instructors can be).  Just motivating and genuinely interested in giving you an effective workout.  I love her!  Plus her bod is fab...I mean come on.
*These exercises are EFFECTIVE. They hurt like h-e-double toothpicks, but in such a good way that you refuse to quit.  The swan arm sequence in particular is killer.  If you've ever tried Tracy Anderson (I have, and yuck), this is the opposite of Tracy's unorganized, flailing, flop of an attempt to work your arms (just my opinion, sorry).
*This is a very doable, no-nonsense workout.  I have no (NO!) ballet background and I had no trouble doing any of the moves.  There are no complicated sequences or steps to learn.
*I love the simple format.  Every exercise is done in four (or is it five? Darn, I can't remember) sets of 8 counts.  I'm sure some would find that boring after a while, but I love the simplicity. It allows me to completely focus on the area I'm working and I always know exactly how many more reps I have to do.
*I love the piano music in the background.  I'm a piano player so this is right up my alley.

Ok, now the cons:
*Minimal stretching.  There is stretching, but it's so quick!  I'm comparing to BM here, but I like a good, deep stretch between sections, and BM wins in this area hands down.  I find myself pausing Ballet Beautiful A LOT to get a good stretch in between sections.  That's annoying.
*Sometimes the camera angle is less than helpful and MHB doesn't give a ton of instruction. The moves are simple, yes, but sometimes I wonder if I'm holding my leg in the right angle and I can't tell by the camera angle and MHB doesn't tell us.  Subtle angle changes can make a big difference, so I want to know exactly what angle I'm supposed to be moving in.

Overall, I love this DVD (and her Total Body Workout) and will continue to incorporate it into my weekly routine.  I'm not giving up BM (ever!) but it's nice to have this as a supplement. Oh, and my original review griped about this DVD not having a ""play all"" option. Oops...that's what the ""custom"" option allows you to do.  I should have spent more time exploring the options before I complained. My apologies!",1384646400,7,2696,4.451020408163266

5324552,3,B009FFHWRU,"I'll start out with the good things.

I love the calmness of it. I'm not the type of person that enjoys a loud work out with blasting music and people yelling at me to go faster. So I enjoy the pace and overall calmness of this DVD.

I like that you can do 15 minute workouts separately for when you're in a time crunch. You can also string them together in an order if you want for a longer workout.

Despite the calmness, the workouts are challenging. Challenging in a sense that they're targeting areas that rarely get worked out.

The downside to this DVD....

She works too fast! As soon as she's done with one set she'll do a quick stretch, like bringing her foot to the back of her head, and move right into the next one. This would be fine, but she doesn't teach you how to stretch so you have to pause it while you figure out your own methods of stretching.

She works out one side at a time. So instead of doing one work out and switching to the other side, she'll move on to a different work out but on the same side. This left me completely exhausted on one side and ""unworked"" on the other. I started pausing after each work out to do the same thing on the otherside and then continued after that side was done.

So overall it's a great work out for everyone. She really helps you maintain good posture which makes all the difference when working out. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for beginners because of the repetitive difficulty of the work out. Ease into it from one of her other DVDs.",1380585600,12,1503,4.252631578947368
5324553,5,B009FFHWRU,"I went on a mission almost 2 years ago to lose weight and get in shape. I lost the weight but still have a lot of toning to do. I was running several miles a week, and did other work outs, like Moms Into Fitness Bootcamp 2, along with hours and hours of Jillian Michaels. I started to get concerned about how my body was taking shape and wanted more of a feminine look. So started looking into ballet. I came across Ballet Beautiful Body Blast. I was concerned it was not going to be enough, but thought I would give it a try anyway. Boy was a wrong. This DVD is amazing. I nearly cried working through the first 15 minute arm section. Then there was the 15 minute body blast. Ouch! I could only barely and feebly do the first of the 2 butt blast sections. This DVD is awesome! I look forward to crying again tomorrow! Thank you Ballet Beautiful. You are going to help me make my own body beautiful. I will be buying your other DVD's as well!",1380326400,10,942,4.1530054644808745

5324555,2,B009FFHWRU,"Just not what I expected.  The music, although beautiful, is slow and not helpful to push you through.

5324556,5,B009FFHWRU,"This is an exceptionally challenging workout dvd. Mary Helen's workouts, of which there are four (each roughly 15 minutes long) are going to leave you cursing and panting hard. I thought I was really strong prior to commencing this dvd, having done Jillian Michaels' workouts 5 days per week for the past two years. However, Mary Helen made me realise how imbalanced my muscles were, in relation to which were strong and which had been effectively neglected.
The four workouts on the dvd are broken into 1 swan arms, 1 total body, and 2 butt and thighs. They are all incredible, both in terms of difficulty and results. I would not recommend this dvd for a genuine beginner, as I can't imagine how anyone without serious muscle tone could last more than 2 minutes into each workout.
I've been doing this dvd for two weeks now and the results are truly amazing. I started looking for something besides Jillian Michaels because although she made me incredibly fit, I realised I was never going to get the lean thighs I was after with her techniques. She's an amazing trainer, but she bulks your legs. Mary Helen does not do that! My legs and butt are more toned than ever before, and the muscles are getting sleeker.

5324569,5,B009FFHWRU,"If you want a dancer's body that is strong and yet bulk-free, this is it. This DVD is the shangri-la! Mary Helen Bowers will help you get there. Even before practicing this DVD's workout, I have been a pretty athletic person. Running for an hour straight on a treadmill? No problem. I have also been doing that crazy (I mean it in the best way) Jillian's cardio workout series. But I was getting worried that my legs were getting too bulky. I realized that I needed something totally different in order to get those long, lean, dancer's body that I wanted. So I bought this DVD.

But oh boy, my first time through this workout - I was cursing like crazy and had to stop every five seconds because my muscles were BURNING. Seriously, you probably don't know what ""burning"" really means if you haven't done this workout series.
I have been doing this workout almost every day for two weeks now, and I still cannot do the fourth 15min workout without pausing very often.

This DVD is amazing, believe me.

Since the workouts are broken into four 15-min parts, doing this workout is completely stress-free to me. I know that this 15min will pass super quickly. That convenience and effective use of time make me want to continue doing this workout.

Here's a tip in having a long, lean, dancer's body like Mary Helen: in her home page, Mary Helen advises us to not run or ride a bicycle or do any exercise of that sort. She says that Ballet Beautiful will be sufficient.

The complementary Ballet Beautiful Total Body Workout is also very good in its own standing, especially for sculpting the inner and outer thighs. I'm just a little disappointed that there are some exercises in which the two DVDs overlap. Other than that, I highly, highly recommend that you purchase this DVD as well as the complementary Total Body Workout DVD.",1375142400,27,1829,4.615384615384615

5324571,3,B009FFHWRU,"Mixed feelings about this DVD. It's nice to have something compact (15-min segments) with 4 foci that you can choose from to tailor to your exercising needs, but I need to give this more time to see how my body responds.

>> PROS <<
:  Mary Helen Bowers is all legs, so that alone will get us buying/excited that we may 'somehow' feel like we will have super long, beautiful lines! Disclaimer should say, She had those legs and physique from birth and years of training, not from this video!
:  It literally is 15 minutes jam-packed with exercises (which is good and bad, see below). I do think you get your time's-worth, so to speak.

>> Cons <<
:  Inconsistent pace. I find that at times MHB speeds up even though she is counting out loud.
:  Very robotic! (Maybe this isn't necessary a CON but) I'm guessing most people know that this isn't meant as a dance/ballet substitute. This is 'fitness in a small space' kind of mini-boot camp where repetition on one leg will get you shaking! There are obligatory ballet phrases thrown in there (like fondue...) to make it seem ballet-ish, but it's not.
:  Fast-paced and no breaks in between, so I found myself hitting the pause button to stretch a few minutes extra, etc. But then again, I suppose that's better for people who don't want to stop?
:  The footage quality is very low-tech, in that you can hear everything that's going on in the background nearby the studio. Although it doesn't impact the exercises per se, it makes you wonder how much these people are putting into their products...

>> General commentary <<
:  I'd love to find out how people who have incorporated this routine into their lives have been transformed and to be included as part of the video ads at the start. And the one-liner about training Natalie Portman? She didn't use this, but how did the training help her build strength?
:  It's also interesting that MHB is at ease doing some of these exercises. Even with her loong legs, each execution is really quick and I sometimes feel like she's going too fast. I get more of a burn if I take at least a half to 3/4 of a second longer on each leg movement.",1374710400,6,2135,4.4627249357326475
5324572,5,B009FFHWRU,"Excellent workout! I felt amazing after and I suffer from back pain and pain in general.  This program is going to have amazing results, I can already tell!

5324573,4,B009FFHWRU,"I read several reviews, both negative and positive, before purchasing.  The good: this is a good workout...my arms feel like putty and I was sweating by the end of each 15 minute section.  The bad: she does go a bit fast if you are not a former dancer/cheerleader/etc.  I modified the workout early on so I could keep up and to ward off muscle fatigue/exhaustion (e.g. I would do every other eight count).

As far as aesthetics, I did not mind the monochrome setting, wardrobe, etc.  It is based on classical ballet, so movement should be the focus.  Overall a good workout that I look forward to mastering/keeping up with soon.

FYI, I am a former dancer that has been out of class (and out of dancer shape) for around 5 years.",1373328000,5,728,4.46969696969697
5324574,5,B009FFHWRU,"I love the Ballet Beautiful workouts!  They are as tranquil as they are tough.  I love the bright white set and the classical music background.  I love that MHB speaks gently to motivate instead of getting bossy like ""bootcamp"" style instructors.  Overall the Ballet Beautiful workouts are some of my smartest fitness purchases.

You may have noted that there are two releases each for the two workouts (Ballet Beautiful Body Blasts and Ballet Beautiful Total Body Workout).  I have both, and I would love to compare for you the differences between the Original releases (with the mostly white covers) and the newer mass market releases (with these covers trimmed with green or purple).  The actual workouts are the same, but a few features are different.

In the new version you suffer through not one but two copyright warnings/; one from Lionsgate and one from Ballet Beautiful. The new discs open with the Lionsgate warnings and then the Lionsgate intro (the one with the turning cogs that tends to remind me of previews a the theatre). No previews to suffer through first. Then it shifts and plays the full preliminary faze in from the original. So, it sadly takes a few extra seconds to actually get TO the workout.

Menus LOOK different, and have two notable differences: programmability and sound options. Each menu is, in appearance, similar to it's case. The new ones show that ugly band of color (purple or green, depending on which) that's on the cover on the menu. The new menus are busy, unattractive, and inelegant. BUT, they are more functional! The new discs allow you to set up your workout similar to the 10 MS discs. If you choose ""custom"" you can select which of the segments you would like to do, in which order you want them, then play through. With the original discs you either ""play all"" or return to the menu after each segment. Sounds options are different. Each gives you a different option. The originals gives you the option to workout with or without music, but with either option you will be listening to MHB. The new ones offer the opposite option: you can turn MHB's voice off or on, but in either option you are listening to the music.

The new option includes Lionsgate trailers on the disc menu (but you only have to watch if you click on that option, which, being an exercise nerd, I did).

Also, there is a difference in cases. The originals had full plastic (not so environmentally friendly but far more protective) cases. The new ones have the cases that have become the norm: the ones with the cut outs in the plastic. Both are pressed discs.

I was rather torn as to which set I prefer. I much prefer the cover art (both front and back) of the original, but the more functional menu on the new ones swayed me. I like being able to not go back to the main menu when I want to do only 2 or 3 segments. And, I felt I was more likely to use the ""music only"" option than the ""voice only"" option (in all honesty, I'm not likely to use either option).",1372550400,7,2988,4.55410447761194

I have to admit when I started the swan arms, especially, I thought it felt a little silly and wondered if this would be effective but after a minute my arms were already burning.  It made me wonder if the typical guy could get past the manliness aspect what they would make of the swan arms as a workout because it sure felt like it was working.  The butt and body blast workouts were equally challenging and all my muscles were burning by the end.

Instructor is clear, non-annoying, and counts for most of workout (which I like.)  Production quality and camera angles are great.  Music is a little uninspiring without a beat but piano does match the ballet aspect.

5324585,5,B009FFHWRU,"I got this dvd along with the ""Total Body Workout"" one. Both (at the time) came to a total of something like $20. Best $20 I ever spent!

Mary Helen Bowers is someone you could picture being the perfect friend to work out with. She has an incredible body and relentless focus/dedication, but also a very sensible, great philosophy about working out, food, body image, etc. She encourages self-acceptance, taking things at your own pace, and maintaining a lifestyle that you can easily sustain over years rather than some 'push yourself to death for 2 months' regime (as though THAT'S going to work long-term!!). As a result, I know some people might find these workouts not ""energizing"" enough but personally, this is exactly what I was looking for. I don't like working out (in the typical sense), I HATE cardio, I didn't want to be shouted at or forced to pump my booty to stupid club music in ways that made me sure to draw the curtains (TIGHTLY) every time I worked out - I just wanted to integrate a good workout into my daily life and gain strength and grace without looking/feeling totally ridiculous.

That being said, the first few weeks of her workouts will likely have you feeling like a floundering whale while she glides through the exercises - the first time I did the bridge series (working abs, butt, thighs, calves, all in one), I was in pain for three days afterwards - but it's sooooo satisfying and exciting to notice yourself improving and thinking, ""Hey, I used to be unable to complete this set with her and now I can keep up!"" I've never had muscles like these (even when I was really into yoga/hot yoga, jogging, etc.) so it's cool to feel strong and energetic as well as slim!

Now that I'm familiar with the workouts on these dvds, I usually don't even need the mat or the dvd: I just pop on my ipod, flop down on the carpet, and do 15-30 minutes of these exercises with Mary Helen's voice in the background of my mind (""Engage!""). Couldn't be easier! This means that it's the first time in my life I have sustained a consistent workout pattern for over 6 months, and the results are obvious and incredibly motivating. I've lost almost 20 pounds in 8 months (and at 5'8 and 140, it's not like I had much to lose, or so I thought) and I get lots of comments on how lean and toned I look now.

Some disclaimers so no one's disappointed: no, this is not a ballet class. It's ballet-based exercises. I think that's fairly obvious if you research the dvd even a little bit, but some people seemed to be expecting something else. Furthermore, don't be surprised if your weight actually goes UP when you first start this workout (for the first month or so): as we're all well aware now, muscle weighs a lot more than flab so until your new muscles start burning off fat (and they will), you'll weigh a bit more as you gain strength. To that effect, you'd be better off ignoring the scale altogether for a while; instead, go by how you feel and how your clothes fit so you stay motivated and see positive results.  And lastly, some people have noted that you would need to add cardio to these workouts to get a complete fitness regimen: to an extent, I disagree. If you are looking to burn lots of fat/lose a ton of weight, yes, you probably will need some extra source of calorie-burning, like extra cardio. But contrary to what many fitness buffs would have you believe, the average human body doesn't need to be pushed to the limits of breathlessness to be healthy. There are definite cardio elements in these workouts in the true 'cardiovascular' sense - i.e. working the whole body and getting the heart rate up - so I feel like that's enough for me.

Thanks for everything, Mary Helen!

*Update: April 29, 2014 - It's been almost a year since I wrote the above review and I'm still enjoying the DVDs in this series and continuing to see great results. I think they are a very good exercise not only physically but mentally - you learn to be patient and stick with yourself for the long haul. This is no crash diet or speed-slimming approach. It's a way to build and strengthen your muscles in ways that last years, rather than weeks. Ditto for flexibility - when I first tried to stretch along with Mary Helen (note: PAUSE the DVD, she stretches way too fast if you're not a ballerina), I was hopelessly stiff; now I'm about 70% to where she is in her stretches. Hope the next year brings me even closer to my goals!",1368316800,250,4441,4.482076637824474

The four different segments pinpoint different parts of the body -- one for the arms, two for the legs and butt, and then one that hits the abs, legs, arms and butt.  Each are 15 minutes long, so it is possible to mix and max.

This is as real a workout as they come -- the moves are graceful but INTENSE, and they are repeated over and over again in four sets of eight.  Done on a regular basis, your body is sure to become more toned.

""Swan Arms"" is a simple, elegant (yet ""burns in all the right spots"") workout for your upper body, ""Butt Blast Series I & II"" are two different workouts - perfect if you want to hone in on your thigh, hip and butt area, and also lengthen and shape the overall line of your leg (these two workouts are the ones I find the most challenging and intensive), and the ""Total Body Blast"" is a comprehensive body workout that can be done in just 15 minutes (fantastic if you don't have a lot of time but need to squeeze a workout in).  In addition to the 3 Total Body 60 minute Workouts I do 3 times per week, I like to mix up the different Ballet Beautiful Blast workouts with the different Cardio Series workouts (which can be streamed off the BB website) to create 3 more BB workouts per week.  This customising, mix n match aspect of the whole Ballet Beautiful programme is truly wonderful - it keeps things fresh, dynamic and fun.

A nice break from traditional exercises such as taebo, bootcamp, circuits, etc.  Piano music was great and the instructor so beautiful.  Ordered the other DVD.",1366588800,8,439,4.945205479452055
5324597,5,B009FFHWRU,"This DVD is one of the most elegant and beautiful workouts I've ever done.  The music is so lovely and Mary Helen's instruction is complete without being annoying or over-the-top.  I would consider myself to be in very good shape and I still found this video to be challenging.  I was really sore after my first go-'round with this.  (I completed 2 of the 15 min workouts- body blast and butt series 1.) I really cannot say enough good things about this DVD.  I will absolutely be investing in more of Mary Helen's videos.

I would urge you to not put too much stock in the 1 and 2 star reviews. Of course there are some things that a person could really nit-pick over, but let's consider the fact that she has created 4 very effective 15 min workouts.  Be realistic with your expectations regarding instruction, etc.  No, the moves do not always follow the rhythm of the music, but I don't think they are meant to compliment.  Rather, the music is meant to provide an elegant background for the exercises themselves.  This isn't a series of choreographed movements, it is a series of strength building movements that could, in time, support choreographed movement.

Bottom line- worth every single penny.",1366243200,18,1205,4.690476190476191

That being said, this is probably not a ""beginner friendly"" workout. It's hard work and takes a lot of dedication, just doing once a week is NOT going to get you results. I always shoot for at least 30 minutes a day, and even that seems lazy to me.

Having four fifteen minute workouts is convenient, it lets me pick what I really want to work on without having to go through stuff I'm just not up for- like if I do swan arms and the full body workout, I may not feel like doing both butt series because I'm tired.

Mary Helen's exercises are very simple and are really nothing revolutionary, but this is a repetition based workout and it's the repetition that will kill you! I mean, if you're keeping good alignment these exercises BURN, big time. My only complaints are that the amount of repetitions do make the workout a tad tedious and I wish there was more stretching (there are stretches but they are extremely quick). I do, however, expect to see excellent toning results from ballet beautiful. I also like that the exercises are organized in 15 minute ""blasts"" if you don't want to commit to a longer workout.

I have not gotten to the advanced moves yet as the beginner moves are enough for me right now.  In my opinion if you have a LOT of weight you're trying to loose, I ""suggest"" getting an aerobics dvd (Jillian Michaels 30 day shred is awesome!) and starting there first.  Then get this for toning as these are not aerobic exercises.

I think it's the combination of Mary Helen Bowers DvDs ( both of them) and a treadmill. But I am certain that these butt and leg workouts made the difference so fast and obvious.
I only gave it 4 starts because I find stomach workout too hard to handle. It hurts my back to stay on that position for so long. So I have to use Elize Gulan ""Ballet Conditioning"" DVD for the abdominal.

No equipment needed, no choreography, just to-the-point, simple exercises.  I am already seeing results in my butt/legs, and my arms look better too - and this is without  being able to perform all of the reps.

5324616,3,B009FFHWRU,This is definitely a challenge. Almost too much so for the beginner. I am not a beginner but I had to keep resting so that I wouldn't cramp up in whatever part of the body we were working. I have been doing strength training for several years. I was doing Chalean Extreme and loved the results but started to feel like I was getting a little too muscular and wanted something to give me definition but in a more feminine way. I tried this DVD and the Ballet Body series by Leah Sarago. I really love the Ballet Body series. I prefer it to this one. Mary Helen is beautiful but she does very few moves and a gazillion reps. It gets a little boring because of the repetitive-ness and that combined with the difficulty of keeping up with her makes me not want to do this workout very often.

I danced for many years and so am familiar with dance workouts and warm ups and that there is typically repetition. But these exercises are excessively repetitive... She does 4 or 5 8-count sets of every exercise and doesn't alternate sides until one side is complete. The arm segment is 14 min. of variations on ""swan arms."" There is not much instruction on body alignment so basically all she is doing is counting to eight for you over and over and over. It is just Mary Helen alone in the studio and it isn't very motivating.  After doing the DVD once I am returning it - very disappointed.",1360281600,10,729,4.432835820895522
5324618,4,B009FFHWRU,"Right off the bat let me tell you why this got a 4 and not a 5. The video is presented as one long video instead of being broken into parts. If it had been broken up into episodes (as it is on iTunes) finding the exact workout you want would be much simpler. (I wish I could have given it a 4.5 or a 4.75 instead of a flat 4.)

And that's pretty much my only complaint. The workouts can be as challenging as you need them to be but can also be modified for people who aren't quite there yet. You can also use the entire video for a very challenging 60 minute session or break it into 4 distinct workouts without feeling as though you're ""quitting"" halfway through. None of the exercises require any special equipment, clothing or preparation. When I started this program I was running 15 to 20 miles a week and thought I was in pretty good shape. Two weeks after starting with Body Blast I STILL have not made it through the entire 60 minutes without needing more than 1 break.

Would I recommend this? Absolutely. And while it can certainly stand on its own, Body Blast (and its companion vid,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B008F283J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout</a>)  is a PERFECT complement to a regimen that already includes a cardio element.

Body Blast won't teach you any ballet moves (in case that's something you're looking for) but it is the first fitness product I've purchased in a long time that feels truly fresh and new.",1360108800,11,1555,4.923664122137405
5324619,5,B009FFHWRU,"I'd heard about Mary Helen Bowers helping Natalie Portman get in shape for Black Swan, and I saw an interview she did on tv and I thought she seemed intelligent and personable, which are all important things for a fitness instructor. She also seemed calm! I am so over the super hyper people in fitness videos that act like they are coked up or something. I am more of a meditative, yoga enthusiast so I prefer a calming workout. Unfortunately, a slow and calming workout isn't going to burn fat super fast... So there's Ballet Beautiful, which looks calm out the outside but is KILLER on the inside.

Have you ever watched a swan? On the water it seems to glide along effortlessly, calmly, elegantly. Have you ever seen a swan's feet paddling under water? They are kicking furiously with all their might, but you can't see them because they are under the water, under the body of the swan. All we see is the beauty, but if we tried to do it ourselves we would realize that its extremely difficult.

I like to watch a workout dvd before I try to do it, so I know what to expect. I'm terribly clumsy so I need to know how much of my furniture I need to move. When I first watched this DVD, especially the swan arms series, I thought I'd just wasted my money. It looked too easy! Mary Helen Bowers is so graceful that she makes each movement look effortless. When I actually did the exercises the next day I realized that I was sooo wrong! During each series you do a ton of reps of each movement to build stamina and to sculpt faster. After the first time I used it I was SO sore afterwards. I couldn't even complete some of the sets, and I am someone who works out 7 days a week. I definitely have some issues with stamina though so I am looking forward to being able to do more after I've mastered the exercises on this dvd. I love a challenge and a lot of the pilates and yoga dvds I've used are too easy.

I do want to mention that an exercise beginner could definitely do this dvd. But if this is you, don't expect too much of yourself and push yourself too hard. Don't get discouraged if you can't complete the set. I have had this dvd for a while now and I find it difficult to complete sets, if I am able to complete them at all. I have been practicing yoga and pilates daily for 10 years now. Work within your comfort level and take breaks. You can see MHB taking breaks too and getting visibly tired! She's been doing ballet her whole life and she admits that this is HER go-to workout. So that's saying something about the efficacy and challenge right there. With exercise, you get back what you put in!

The exercises themselves are very similar to pilates, but are ballet-like in movement. Its really enjoyable to watch and to do. After the first time I could definitely feel the work I did in muscles I don't normally use in my other workouts.

One of my favorite things about the dvd was that it wasn't cheesy and MHB doesn't act like a cheerleader the whole time. The sets are clean and all the focus is on the exercise. There isn't a whole lot of ridiculous dancing around or yelling into the camera. There's no cheesy music either thank goodness. Its very calming and relaxing and all the focus is on the exercise. Its just what I was looking for and everything I'd hoped it would be. I love that you can turn off MHB's narration if you want to and just do the exercises while listening to classical music. So nice after a long day and all you want to do is work out and get inside your own head and not have to listen to other voices.",1359936000,49,3552,4.271916790490342

5324621,5,B009FFHWRU,"I started with Mary Helen Bowers' Total Body Workout DVD and then finally bought this one. I honestly thought it might be a waste of money because I saw a preview clip online and thought it was just be a repeat of Total Body and then the rest would be simple versions of Tracy Anderson moves, but I was wrong. This DVD will kick your butt (and arms, and back, and everything else) Body Blast makes it burn, but it's an amazing burn.

I wrote a review for the Total Body workout and talked about how Ballet Beautiful compares to Tracy Anderson--but I do want to say that I get excited to do Ballet Beautiful more than I've ever been excited to work out. It doesn't make me dread it and I think it's her relaxed, graceful attitude that I find very motivating and welcoming. Tracy's workouts require me to think more about the move and in general it's just more complicated.  Yes, that makes a good workout, BUT Mary Helen Bowers has come up with some very simple but powerful moves that tone, elongate, and kick your muscles into shape. It's almost relaxing just in the fact that it's uncomplicated, except you will find yourself trying to imagine you are in another world so you don't have to feel the intense pain and trembling going on from all the reps. I think the classical music also helps me focus on the workout and inspires me, as I said in the other review, it does make you feel like a ballerina. Mary Helen's voice is also very soothing. :)

Also, I'm convinced the Swan Arms combined with the arm segment in Total Body are all a person needs to get trim, toned arms. You don't need pushups, you don't need weights. What this does is gives you that sculpted but feminine ballerina body.

5324626,2,B009FFHWRU,"I take no issue with the content of the workout.  The instructor obviously knows what she is doing, and she provides moves that work the targeted areas of the body just as she promised.  I think this would be a great conditioning video for someone who already dances, as it provides good mat work.  Beginners probably would find this boring, as all four segments of the workout rely on repetitious sets.  I can't blame the instructor for this, since this is what is necessary to get the results.

But I can't say that I love this video, or even like it, because I found the instructor's total disregard for the music particularly distracting.  Given the fact that this is supposed to be a ballet workout, I really expected the instructor to pay more attention to the music playing in the background even if it meant just timing her sets to the actual music.  But she uses it as merely background, which was disappointing at best, and distracting at worst.  She counts out the reps, but her counts don't correspond to the music.  Considering the pianist is playing sonatas written in 4/4 time, I don't see why she couldn't just time her moves to the music or find music that matches the pace of her moves.  My brain was having a really hard time adjusting.

The biggest issue I take with this download, though, has NOTHING to do with the video.  I am really annoyed at the fact that Amazon charges almost double the price of the DVD of the SAME workout, when the digital download actually offers less.  The workout clearly is divided up into four 15-minute sections, and the instructor makes it clear that you can do each section on its own or as part of a whole workout.  But there is no way to jump to these sections in the digital download without using the rewind or the fast forward button.  Which means doing the workouts out of order when using Amazon Instant is very annoying and time consuming.  I suspect this problem goes away with the DVD purchase, which presumably is organized in chapters.  So then why is Amazon charging me so much more for the download?  I hope Amazon takes this into account and adjusts its pricing on the instant download.",1357776000,19,2156,4.555844155844156

5324628,3,B009FFHWRU,"This is an okay workout for the lower body and great for toned arms. Like the Total Body Workout, it completely overlooks the back muscles, and for me, that's a big issue. It's got some merit as a lower body workout, although if you own anything by Tracy Anderson, don't waste your money on this as you've already got all these exercises (although personally, I find the music on this much more pleasant, and Mary Helen's style, despite the constantly repeated stretching comments). As for me for some background, I am an avid daily exerciser, and I do full-body workouts. I work out first thing in the morning before work, so I like to consolidate as much as possible. I don't want to be wasting time switching DVD's, etc. I'm 45, pear-shaped, and don't tend to bulk, and my upper back hurts due to some old postural issues - I need to exercise it every day to keep the pain away and build muscle mass to keep my upper body in proportion with my lower (and, as I said, I don't bulk easily.....) So, here's my issues with this workout:

Pros:

- The classical piano music is a really nice change of pace over most workout videos.
- The lower body sequence does exhaust the muscle groups, and seems like it will work in the long term.
- The 15 minute blast works the abs.
- The 15 minute arm series will give you some nicely toned arms if you can get through it.

Cons:

- I could not find a way to play the DVD straight through. I had to go through and add each of the 6 sections to a matrix. Time consuming, which I don't want to be bothered with at 5AM.
- No upper body workout on this DVD. I always do an upper body workout. Basically, this is an add-on to whatever else I'm doing, and I'll use it when I think my arms or butt needs a little help, or i've over-indulged and want to burn some extra calories.
- The stretching and ""take a sip of water"" comments were repeated over and over. It gets annoying really quickly. I think a short stretch at the end of a section would be just as beneficial for anyone familiar with this sort of workout. I work out all the time, I know when I need a drink.
- Nothing new or different in the glute/hip routine, it seems to be very similar to a Tracy Anderson workout. I did T.A. for 4 months and lost a lot of ground in my legs and back, so this is not something I would use exclusively, but more as an add-on to other barre-work that builds strong leg muscles.
- I find it hard to do exercises for an extended period while down on all 4's. I did try them while using a chair, and it was much more comfortable for my back.

I much prefer Leah's Sarago's Ballet Lower Body Workout for a straight-up lower body workout; or Bar Method  and Tonique/ Tonique Mat for a more balanced workouts. I'm going to keep this around for those times when I need a little extra oomph in my workouts.",1357430400,4,2825,4.212569316081331

I downloaded this on my iTunes so I could do it when traveling and to try something new ... I was sore for DAYS ... I used muscles I clearly don't get to on the regular (especially in my legs,  butt and core).  I thought I would need to use ankle weights to get any sort of challenge ... WRONG!  The first time I tried I couldn't do all the lower body repetitions ... I'm excited to make this part of my regular routine!",1356566400,27,568,3.9130434782608696
5324633,5,B009FFHWRU,"Purchasing this Body Blast DVD and the full-body one was my first experience using Mary Helen's workouts, and I really like them. The soothing classical piano music, the lovely white set, and Mary Helen's soft voice make for two workouts that are pleasant -- even while Mary Helen is killing you! These might look easy, but they are tough!

As other reviewers have noted, these are not ballet exercises, but more toning/strengthening exercises.  All you need to do this workout and the Total Body one is a mat.

The Body Blast DVD includes four fifteen-minute segments:  Swan Arms, 15-Minute Total Body Blast,  Butt Blast 1, and Butt Blast 2.

Since I've personally found it really hard to do the two Butt Blast segments back-to-back, my big tip is to start with Butt Blast 2, then go back to the main menu and ""Play All"" so that you then do then do Swan Arms, the Total Body Blast, and Butt Blast 1.  Doing the workout this way allows my glutes and legs to get a nice break between the two Butt Blast segments so that I can complete the whole workout -- and still walk the next day!  ;-)

If you are familiar with Tracey Anderson's workouts, the two Butt Blast segments on the Blasts DVD reminded me a lot of Tracey's Metamorphosis Hipcentric workout, where you work your legs from an all-fours position. I got great results using Tracey's Hipcentric before I had to stop it due to back strain, but because Mary Helen uses slower pacing, her workout seems much easier on my back. I do have some wrist pain when doing these two segments, but Mary Helen says that you can go down to your forearms if you need to.

For each exercises, you will do four sets of eight repetitions. Mary Helen counts each and every rep, which some people might not like, but I've found that it helps me get into the rhythm of the moves.  She also repeats the same phrases, and I could see how that might get old after a while.

If you like these, you might also like Leah Sarago's Ballet Body workouts (Ballet Body Signature Series Upper Body Workout, Ballet Body Signature Series Core Body Workout, and Ballet Body Signature Series Lower Body Workout), which are equally challenging, but equally fun.

I've also had really great results recently using these.  When I first got them, I didn't do them on a regular basis, but just recently, I was sick and didn't feel like doing any cardio.  I only did MHB's two DVDs for about three weeks (with no cardio) -- and my legs and arms really tightened up!  I feel like I had better results in just three weeks with MHB's workouts than I did with 42 days of Tracey Anderson's Hipcentric.  Mary Helen is like the poor woman's Tracy Anderson!  (I realize that the two methods are very different since TA has you changing up your workouts every ten days, but the Ballet Beautiful workouts seem to work better for me!)

I also love how graceful I feel after doing these!  I haven't taken a ballet class since I was about five, but I feel like a ballerina doing these!

UPDATE ON 6-6-15:  If you search YouTube, the Be Fit channel has several segments from this and the Total Body DVD on their channel so you can watch them for free and try them out before buying the DVD.  :)

UPDATE ON 7-13-15:  Cathe Friedrich (another wonderful instructor who puts out top-notch workout DVDs) just published an article in her weekly newsletter, stating that the best exercises for building the glutes without making the thighs/quads bigger are bridges (which Mary Helen does a lot of on her Total Body DVD) and quadruped hip extensions (which are the exercises that Mary Helen does in the two Butt Blast segments on this Blasts DVD).  No wonder these workouts help build a nice, round posterior!  The article, in case you want to search for it (unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow us to provide links to outside sites in our reviews) is called ""Can You Build Glutes Without Increasing the Size of Your Thighs?"" and it was published on Cathe's website on July 12, 2015.",1356307200,378,3973,4.559154929577465
5324634,5,B009FFHWRU,"I get bored doing the regular workouts, so this was a nice change of pace.  The workouts are in 15 minute increments and can be done anywhere.  The arm workout is harder than many arm workouts I have done with weights! Every 15 minute segment is difficult and will challenge anyone regardless of his or her fitness level.  It is easy to watch the video and think the exercises are easy because it is a professional ballerina doing them.  Don't be fooled!",1355875200,4,454,4.5

5324636,5,B009FFHWRU,"Body Blast is efficient, challenging and IT WORKS!
I love the fact that I don't need any equipment for this work out. I can bring it with me when I travel and it's so reassuring to know I can throw it in the DVD player get a good burn if I only have 15 min. Even when I'm home I use it to get some serious muscle work when I can't put in a full hour. Yesterday I did Swan Arms before I ran to pick up my kid at school - it was great to get a little exercise rather than doing nothing and feeling frustrated that there aren't enough hours in the day.
This works because I can do it, it's easy for me to fit exercise into my schedule when it's broken into very targeted pieces. I guess that's why they're called Blasts!
Ballet Beautiful Body Blast is easy to do, I have no dance experience at all and I am always amazed by how pretty these moves look and what an awesome workout I get from them. And I have to say I love the aesthetic; so refreshing, modern and chic!",1355356800,20,965,3.953846153846154

8540991,5,B009FFHWRU,"I used to run and do pretty intense workout dvd's (Bob Harper I still love you), but I let myself get out of shape over the past few years. When I decided to start working out again, I looked for something ""gentle"" that didn't require jumping around or putting a lot of stress on my knees or back (getting older sucks!). These workouts aren't taxing on your joints but they are NOT easy! I swear in just about 6 workouts, I already feel like I lost inches. My stomach/waist feels more ""zipped up"" my posture has improved, and my lower body is more firm. I'm not sure if this type of workout will result in weight loss, but that's more dependent on how you eat anyway. Like other's have said, her stretches are super quick. I just pause and take as much time as I need before moving on to the next set.",1518134400,,801,4.241830065359477
8540992,5,B009FFHWRU,"I have been doing the exercises in this DVD for years and they are still as challenging as day 1. The Butt Series are some of my favorite Ballet Beautiful workouts ever. The swan arms exercise is intense and tones the back so well, all without the use of any weights.
If lean, toned (not bulky) legs are what you are looking for, do the butt series. They are HARD but so worth it. What is so wonderful about Ballet Beautiful exercises is that you can do them anywhere and get amazing results. More importantly, the results last because the workouts are so sustainable.
The only minor ""complaint"" I have is that the contents of this DVD, along with the Total Body Workout DVD are now available for free on the BeFit channel on youtube. Nevertheless, I think this DVD is very reasonably priced and it was worth every penny and more!",1514160000,4,830,4.467105263157895

8540997,5,B009FFHWRU,"I actually read the reviews for this several months ago, and started doing the exercises using YouTube videos instead of purchasing. I decided to go ahead and buy this one anyway because the results have been pretty awesome and because interrupting the series by finding and starting the next video keeps me from doing as much as I would if it were just a single video playing.

Context - I run a fair bit, ten to fifteen miles at a go, uphill or down, bike commute five days a week, and rock climb. I didn't use these videos to attempt to lose weight, just to tone and get stronger without bulking up. I can do a handful of crunches one day and have a rock-hard sixpack a couple days later, so when I'm climbing hard I can bulk up a little more than I like. I'm also quite thin, but my lower half is less lean than my upper, so despite running quite a bit, my legs were still kind of ""loose"", if that makes sense. Basically, I'm an ectomorph with mesomorph traits and a somewhat pear shape.

After doing the butt exercises from this video and the inner and outer thigh ones from the other video, my legs are freaking killer. I had no idea my legs were even capable of having shape, but the best part is I don't look like I've been lifting weights, I just have muscles and they give my legs incredible shape. I freaking love wearing shorts now.

Probably the tipping point for me though had to do with how this helped me with rock climbing. I took a year off but started doing the swan arms series several times a week. My weakest point has always been my back muscles - I have crappy posture and I don't regularly engage those muscles so they are weaksauce. I started climbing again several months after making swan arms a regular part of my routine, and I was climbing 5.10's of all stripes instantly, off the couch! Normally after a break in climbing, even a 5.9 will be challenging, but I feel like I'm stronger than ever, and better able to do moves that used to feel impossible. But again, it's not a result of bulky biceps, but a better connection between my arms and shoulders and the muscles in my back. My posture is still fairly awful, but it's no longer painful for me to mimic good posture - it used to hurt just to pull my shoulders down and back, but now I have the right muscles to do that. Maybe if I keep strengthening them and focusing on it, I can avoid developing a dowager's hump. That would be cool.

I will say though I don't think this lady is very nice, despite her cupcake-princess demeanor. There is smugness lurking in that saccharin smile of hers...fortunately, it's a good motivator to not stop working!",1501977600,5,2634,4.358452138492872
