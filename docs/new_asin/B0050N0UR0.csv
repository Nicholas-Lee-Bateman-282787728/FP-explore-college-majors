4516019,5,B0050N0UR0,Watched this after starting the PBS series so was a little disappointed until I caught onto the Doc's jargon.  Prefer the series but this would have been better had I watched it first.  Still a good program.,1317513600,,207,4.5675675675675675
4516020,4,B0050N0UR0,"We enjoyed the movies but they are not the same as the TV series.  Good way to get an introduction into Doc Martin series,",1317427200,,122,4.083333333333333
4516021,3,B0050N0UR0,"After watching these two movies courtesy of Netflix, I'm left thinking that ""Doc Martin"" from the series is a much better and much more humorous creation.  ""Doc Martin"" in these two movies really isn't a particularly interesting character.  He's just a doctor who after discovering his wife cheated on him wanders down to a Cornish coastal village and decides to stay.  He may be a fish out of water but he's the not the truly exotic ""fish out of water"" of the series.

Don't get me wrong...the movies are watchable.  But there aren't --at least for me-- any laugh out loud moments like the series is full of.  The supporting cast in the movies isn't as good as the series either...with one exception, Neve McIntosh's ""Rita"" was a pretty interesting and bewitching putative love interest for Doc Martin in the movies (although nothing really happened with that story line).  Caroline Catz of the series is great, but I think McIntosh's character would have fit in just as well in the series.

So I'd recommend not buying this movie set but getting it on Netflix or something similar.",1317340800,42,1083,4.754010695187166
4516022,4,B0050N0UR0,"Martin Clunes, in a role that served as preparation for the TV Doc Martin series, does a good job at entertaining the viewer in the familiar scenery of Port Isaac/Port Wenn, North Cornwall. Although not the same character, Doc Martin Bamford is an entertaining enough character and keeps things sufficiently stirred up in his small village in Cornwall. We can be grateful to the three prequel films that were instrumental in the development of the Doc Martin character, especially as it finally evolved in the TV series.

It is interesting to catch scenic glimpses of sites that were to be made famous in the TV series such as Doc Martin's office and the church/school on the cliff. In the prequel films the location is called Port Isaac, the real name of the village, whereas in the TV series the name is changed to Port Wenn. There seems to be some division as to the proper spelling of Port Wenn, some spelling it Portwenn; as the village only exists in the imagination I suppose that doesn't really matter. Most of the spellings generated by Port Isaac publicity seem to favor the Port Wenn version.

The main reason we watched this film was our enjoyment of the TV series and the charming scenery to be found in Port Isaac. The movie holds up well on its own and provides a pleasant evening's entertainment for the family.",1316044800,11,1327,4.666666666666667
4516023,5,B0050N0UR0,"I bought these two movies in Region 2, because as most good BBC/ITV they were not available here.  Glad to see they now are.

I was a Clunes fan from Doc Martin, like most.  I was not disapointed in these films.  They do hold their own.  Clunes is also great in ""William and Mary.""  If you haven't seen it, check it out.",1313539200,69,320,4.080645161290323
4516024,5,B0050N0UR0,"Two feature length stories take the character of Doc Martin Bamford (Martin Clunes) and remove him from a London obstetric practice and places him in Port Isaac, Cornwall. You'll love this scenery as much as in ""Doc Martin: collection - Series 1-4"", for those who, like me, watched the TV series first and now catch-up with the movies. They are great in their own right. It's true, SOME of the characters in this double-feature were first created by Craig Ferguson & Mark Crowdy in ""Saving Grace"", but I did not care for that first introduction of Martin nearly as well as these two stories. To be fair, most Amazon reviewers disagree with me on S.Grace.

Besides Clunes, carryover characters for both films include lobsterman Harvey (Tristan Sturrock who also played Harvey in S.Grace & Danny Steel in the TV series); Justine (Barbara Lott-`Ballet Shoes') a nosy shopkeeper; lovely Rita (Neve McIntosh-`Lady Audley's Secret') almost a lover; Petronella (Lynsey Baxter) the wife/cheater who caused Martin to leave; Cabbie Mitch (Mark Heap-a superstar postman in ""Lark Rise to Candleford""); Pub owner Charley (Paul Brooke-""Bridget Jones Diary' and also Charlie in S.Grace); & Vicar (Stephen Moore). It's a stellar cast, good writing, and fantastic setting. You will notice similarities from scenes in these films, the TV series, & Saving Grace. All were filmed in Port Isaac, but in the TV series the name changed to Portwenn. The locals of this double feature as every bit as eccentric and delightfully common as those in the TV series. Awesome pub-style music by Mark Thomas.

Doc Martin- 87 minutes with SUBTITLES
Doc Bamford discovers his 3 doctor friends have been bedding his wife Petronella. Thus the trip to seclusion, which ends in Port Isaac mud and a lobster boat gig. From there the relationships develop as well as difficulty when the town's newcomer is accused of being the evil fiend secretly passing jellies (molded gelatin) with an embedded photo. You'll also get an adult view (not for kids) of a couple (combined weight well over a quarter ton) making love, drug use, nudity, sexual situations, and medical scenes, most of that warned about on the box. With that comes belly laughs, characters you'll never forget (even if you want to), and some top acting. It's not exactly the same as ""Doc Martin: 1-4 TV Series"" but just as good. Clunes is the only actor that carried to the TV series as the same character. In the later, Clunes picks up some of the curmudgeon traits that was seen in Dr. Cadbury (Jeremy Child-see ""First Among Equals"") in this film.

Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie- 75 minutes with SUBTITLES
A cloutie is a cloth piece tied to a branch and a wish comes true as it rots. Doc Martin Bamford (Doc Martin was an Ellingham in the series) stoops to cloutie-ing to get an out-of-the-way home he fights over with the London Bowden development family. Family boss, Mrs Bowden is Anna chancellor (Four Weddings and a Funeral). Doc gets a bra strap cloutie from Lolita (Pam Ferris-`Jane Eyre' `Little Doritt' `Darling Buds of May' +). He even terrorizes kids. This film has duo-plots. There is also smuggling taking place, and of course the Doc gets caught in all sorts of illegal dealings. Enter the custom agents. Hilarious. The fat second in command, Lester (Steven O'Donnell) has few lines but makes up for it in action and expression. He is a gut busting comic, stealing scene after scene. It's easy to see why the response was so great after this film that the series was started. Watch closely in this film, the house front of Rita's place becomes Doc Martin Ellingham's Portween office a few years later.

Not enough of Martin Clunes yet?
Take a look at the NEW series ""Reggie Perrin"" & an older series ""Demob"" & ""Lorna Doone"" 2000.",1310601600,202,3778,4.843653250773994
4516025,5,B0050N0UR0,"I have the Australian/Region 4 discs of the two DOC MARTIN movies which were released a few years back (and have since gone out-of-print).

Firstly, these movies are really good! I don't think most people would be disappointed, HOWEVER, to fans of the TV series, I must warn you that this Doc is NOT the same surly Doc from the ITV television show.

If you've ever noticed the end credits to an episode of DOC MARTIN, you might have noticed the credit ""arising from the film SAVING GRACE."" That is because the character of Doc Martin is based on the character Dr. Martin Bamford from that movie, who was also played by Clunes, and which was also set in the same fishing village (except under its real name of Port Isaac rather than the made-up name of Port Wenn).

After the film SAVING GRACE came out, Clunes' production company decided they'd like to do some more with the character and signed a deal with Sky television to produce a series of made-for-TV movies: two a year for what was to have been a three-year deal. The two movies in this collection, ""Doc Martin"" and ""Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie"" were the only two that were made (as Sky Pictures went under before any others could be produced).

Both telefilms are ""prequels"" to SAVING GRACE and take place in the same ""universe"". In other words, the locations are the same and some of the supporting cast are the same. The first telefilm tells the story of how the Doc leaves behind city life to be in the country. The second film shows him as more-or-less established in the village.

To use a comic-book/sci-fi analogy, these movies (including SAVING GRACE) are set in a parallel universe to the ITV show.",1308009600,471,1679,4.5647840531561465

4516057,5,B0050N0UR0,"'Doc Martin' is one of those shows, I have found that gets better as it ages. However, the first year was very entertaining. There was something a little hit strange about he main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.

Dr. Martin Ellingham, a London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also dies not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.

Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella. Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.

Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline. Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables, and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan. I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.

Before his character was refined to have Asperger's Syndrome, if that's what he's got, Doc Martin SMILED. You don't see that much any more, just an occasional grimace of pain when he bumps his head. Evidently Martin Clunes suggested a refinement to his character which would make him more serious and thus more comic. And it gave him a chance to distinguish from the characters he had played before. More dramatic, you see. It is enjoyable and not really offensive for having been a departure from what the series would become. So see it; enjoy it; let it fill the hole in your Doc Martin viewing life until the next TV series is available when we learn if the Doc's marriage stabilizes and if he can practice surgery again.",1482796800,12,884,4.6369426751592355

4516268,5,B0050N0UR0,"Martin Clunes is still another gift the British have offered to Americans, whose own sense of irony and humor is based upon silly rhetoric and slapstick movements. The subtlty we clearly lack is likely why Americans who think turn to the British for everything in performance art -  serious drama, lighthearted but clever comedy, great scripting and terrific delivery. I'll take Martin Clunes any way I can get him, but there is something charming about this iteration vs. the much-more-complex character he presents in the ongoing TV series. Doc Martin is a delight in both iterations, because the characters seem so tangibly  real and easy to love. One feels compelled to root for the all, even the warmhearted but clearly flawed characters who inhabit the fictional Port Wenn. Kudos - and a sincere American ""thank you"" - for this charming import.",1434412800,,850,5.0212765957446805

Unfortunately, in these films, the good doctor is as dull as ditchwater. He's such a damp squib.

It's no fun when your title character is the dullest person on screen.

It's just boring and lame, and not worth your time. Avoid, and stick with the superb TV series.",1429401600,2,369,4.242857142857143

4516301,5,B0050N0UR0,"This is not the older, gruff Doc Martin of the TV series, but a younger, more open-hearted Martin Clune. These prequels find him seeking refuge from a spectacularly failed marriage in the seaside Cornish village of his childhood. He finds more, and, pitched into its mysteries and mischief, a warm new home.

In the second one, ""Doc Martin and the the Legend of the Cloutie,"" magic arrives. Done out of the cottage he desires by a scheming real estate agent, he becomes obsessed with running off the obnoxious couple who elbowed him out with a bribe. Their young daughter is afraid of the Beastie, who seems to exist to sell books and postcards to tourists. We see him leaving a local shop with a stuffed puma.

His efforts to scare the couple off with night-time howls falls short, for they are determined to get rich subdividing the small farm. The locals tell him to get a cloutie -- a scrap of cloth (presumably not polyester)  to wish on and tie to a tree branch. When it rots off, your wish will be granted -- but not without complications. These are hilarious, and involve African as well as Cornish magic.

The idea that large black cats populate the southwest of Britain is not new, and recently photographed sightings, as inconclusive as Bigfoot's, populate the pages of the Fortean Times, possibly the only magazine not sold through Ammie (forteantimes dot com). And the stuffed puma? The movie ends with Doc Martin sitting contentedly in his cottage yard beside a large bag of cat food.

He fills a bowl, sets it down at a distance, and calls.  A large, shiny black cat emerges to nibble.",1422662400,4,1600,4.656028368794326

Think about them a lot, and discuss them with members of my household who watch the series as well. I've found that the characters are riveting for them, not just me.

I really like the series and will continue to watch all available seasons as the show is wonderful. These 2 movies are very different from the series since the character and his background are completely different from what is portrayed in the series, but worth watching nonetheless. In these 2 movies the character is more relatable, fun loving, someone you would want to get to know, not standoffish like the character in the series. I am glad that I didn't watch these movies first, as I might then not like the character in the series and would maybe not be interested in watching the series which would have been a mistake. I must admit though, I am curious as to why the network or producers of the show decided to change the character of Doc Martin as drastically as they did. Good acting by all, good plots, laugh out loud funny at times so definitely worth watching these 2 movies as well as the series, just understand the character is different.",1398038400,5,1045,4.5638297872340425

4516409,3,B0050N0UR0,"It was inevitable that the two made-for-TV DOC MARTIN films would make it to DVD, given the enormous success of the current series. Those of us who enjoy our Martin Clunes as Doc Martin fix have been waiting with baited breath.

The good news is that they give us more of what we love. The not as good news is that the two films, made prior to the commissioning of the actual series, feature characters and characteristics that are simply not as fun as those which were developed for the show.

Perhaps it is the irritating but endearing character of the doctor himself, with his blood phobia (a brilliant character touch). How much more interesting and original is that compared to a wifes infidelity? Another characteristic of the doctor featured in these films, is that he regularly smokes marijuana. This appears to be a nod to the original feature film Saving Grace, in which Doc Martin was first introduced.

Id rather see an uptight doctor than one given to what many still consider (as I do) a vice. Drug use, in my view, is not funny. If these films are to be believed, half the population of the idyllic little Cornish village where the stories are set, are tokers. Nothing charming or quaint about that.

But these are minor quirks in light of the bigger picture, which is the origin of Doc Martin. It is admittedly fun to compare how these foundational films were changed, developed and honed into the beloved series that is still being produced in 2011.

This is one reviewer who doesnt like to summarize plots in reviews, but rather chooses to talk about production values, actors and various related subjects which may or may not guide a potential viewer to a particular film or program. DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES is as picturesque as the series, and is certainly entertaining, but the spark that makes the series so utterly addictive is missing. The characters and the writing simply had a ways to go from these early efforts.

Thankfully, for the sheer joy of the viewer, they succeeded.

DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES is a necessary set for the DOC MARTIN completionist, but be suitably warned: the best was yet to come.",1397433600,2,2128,4.689008042895442

The pain and heartache of the main character is stunningly portrayed, and gently healed, despite the horrendous cause of his sorrow.

Clunes plays Dr. Martin Bamford after the lead character in a 2000 comedy film, ""Saving Grace"". Here he's a gynecologist getting away from an unfaithful wife, and winds up becoming the local family doctor. He's a talented doctor and much more human, and without the almost-crippling phobia to blood. If you can separate him from his other persona,  the two movies a lot of fun.

4516454,4,B0050N0UR0,Because I watched the series first I was surprised by the pleasant bedside manner.  I was not expecting the bed scene that sort of pushed family viewing aside.

I am not sure if this was the pilot but this is a more cheery, fun-loving Martin Clunes than you may be used to in the version shown in the States. This and the new version makes a wonderful contrast and shows the many ways that directors can interpret characters and actors like Clunes bring them to life.

4516473,5,B0050N0UR0,Doc Martin is totally a different person in the early days.  More relaxed and the humor is much more apparent.,1390521600,,110,4.5
4516474,5,B0050N0UR0,I love the Doc Martin series.  I think it was a great idea to give him a personality makeover.  Hilarious,1390435200,,105,4.2

4516476,5,B0050N0UR0,"These two Doc Martin movies came out prior to the TV series. Those who have already seen the series (as I had before I watched the movies) will immediately recognize that, although Martin Clunes plays the Doc in both the movies and the series, his personality is amazingly different. The Doc of the movies eats junk food, drinks beer, smokes cigarettes (and pot), sometimes dresses casually (not always in a suit and tie), and actually smiles and is reasonably friendly to the rest of humanity, including his patients. Moreover, he hasn't developed his hemophobia yet, and he is an obstetrician by trade (rather than a surgeon), who has escaped to Port Isaac (still called by its real name rather than Portwenn) after finding out that his wife was cheating on him. The townsfolk are almost totally different from those in the TV series. (No Louisa, Bert and Al Large, Aunts Joan and Ruth, and the others who help make the series a real classic.)

Of the two movies, the first is better because it is a bit more realistic. The second was a bit too farfetched for my taste. However, because this is a subjective judgment it's unlikely that everyone will agree.

Nevertheless, both movies are well acted, particularly by Clunes, and are definitely worth watching.",1390176000,,1260,4.828703703703703

4516478,5,B0050N0UR0,"I really enjoyed the Doc Martin series, but, I am trying to wrap my head around the fact that Doc's personality and the people in the town are completely different than the series.  I can't imagine Doc working as a fisherman even for a short time.  I really like this Doc Martin.  He seems like he has a heart and seems much more spontaneous.  If you realize only the name has remained the same, it's still a good movie.  I would recommend it.  Even better that it is offered on Amazon Prime for free.",1390089600,,501,4.276595744680851

4516536,4,B0050N0UR0,I watched this movie because I had enjoyed the series by the same name. Doc Martin was more forgiving of the wrong done to him by his wife than I would have expected of his character. Doc Martin is always the hero when it comes to medical interventions. I would recommend this to any fan of the series.,1382918400,,302,4.224137931034483
4516537,3,B0050N0UR0,These Doc Martin movies are not as funny as the most recent series; instead they seem more like a mean spirited attempt to mock a culture. This turned me off.,1382918400,,158,4.3

I have not seen the series but did watch ""Doc Martin: The Movies"" just to take a look. I am hooked now. This is so true to life; every character is priceless. And in Brit tradition, the actors are great, the scenes are beautifully photographed, the people are so believable it seems as if someone had a video camera and went around town filming its inhabitants. Now Doc is one of my favorites!",1382745600,,503,4.25

4516550,5,B0050N0UR0,"Great intro to the series. Martin's personality very different than in the series. I don't know why these characters and stories are so hilarious, but the British know how to create a good story better than just about anyone.",1381449600,,225,4.794871794871795
4516551,5,B0050N0UR0,"A friend told me about the tv series. When I went to see if I could download the tv show, these movies came up, so I decided to watch them. Gives a good description of what to expect for the tv show.  Totally enjoyed the story and actors.  English movies and shows don't try to be glamorous, quite the opposite.  Like that aspect. Highly recommend the movies.",1381104000,,359,4.3283582089552235

4516561,3,B0050N0UR0,"The Doc Martin of the feature length movies is not at all the same as the rarely lovable but always compelling Doc Martin of the tv series.  The movie character is okay but a bit bland.  The series character is like House in a different setting....nasty, irascible, capable of only occasional warmth, and having little desire to be liked.  Seeing what new obnoxious behavior the character comes up with, and what amazing cures he effects, is most of the fun of the series, and that is lacking in the movies.
The series has a lot of topical commentary on life, medicine, and relationships.  Though the main character is sometimes really difficult to take, he is complex and interesting.  The other characters are well-played and well-written.
If one hasn't seen the show, the movies would probably be more interesting.  Having watched the series first, I wasn't impressed by these movies.  But they are okay for an idle evening, and watching Martin Clunes play any character is enjoyable.",1379030400,,987,4.909638554216867

Here, Doc Martin is Martin Bamford so leaves the city to get away from it all in Port Isaac after he discovers his wife has been sleeping with many of his friends. Martin is a very different character here... not the uptight individual of the TV series. I like both interpretations, and enjoyed these movies every bit as much as I enjoy the series.

These two movies are nice but I like the PBS series better. His abrupt tell it as he sees it character on the PBS series adds more interest and depth to the series.

4516575,4,B0050N0UR0,"I'd have given the first movie a 5-star rating, and it's worth the price for both to have the one. The second needed better writers. The acting was good.

I watched these after learning to love the current Doc Martin on PBS, which are always good fun. I was surprised to see a SMILING Doc. Martin, but it was so much fun I soon made the switch.

The movie is absolutely stupid with a plot that might amuse 10-year olds. There is very little ""doc"" in Doc Martin such as interaction with patients. Instead, Doc crawl around, dressed like a swat team member, chasing after some ghost. I was most disappointed.

I own all 5 sets of Doc Martin which I enjoy very much (I have viewed all 5 series several time and have learned to like the characters and, of course, the scenery. Doc Martin's personality is too much at times. Is he so full of hate that he seems incapable to show some tenderness towards his lovely wife?",1352246400,2,623,4.513274336283186

Thus, we searched out both Amazing Grace (the movie, not the TV show) and then the two follow up Doc Martin movies which spun off from Amazing Grace. The Doc Marting movies are frequently called ""prequells"" to the TV show, but they are really not. The character of Doc Martin is QUITE different, and the story arc has nothing to do with the TV show. So the only real simularities are that Martin Clunes is the lead actor and they are situated in Port Isaac.
The three movies are enjoyable enough - we rate them 3 stars - but not up to Doc Martin the series, which we would rate at 5 stars.",1349481600,,755,4.25

4516653,5,B0050N0UR0,"I am a huge fan of the TV series Doc Martin, and thought I would like these movies. The character Doctor Martin Bahnford originally appeared in the film ""Saving Grace"" as the local doctor. This movie and the other(Doc Martin and the legend of the cloutie) takes place before this, and tells how he got to little town in Port Issac. Later the character was changed into Doctor Martin Ellingham in the TV series ""Doc Martin"".

So, this is not the same character as in the show, though I think you will enjoy this if you like the TV show or the movie ""Saving Grace"" (I love both).

Anyways, in this movie Doc Martin, a surgeon, runs away from his cheating wife to a small town in Port Issac. Here he ends up fishing and finds himself caught in the mystery of ""the jelly maker"". I don't want to spoil what the jelly maker does...but it is one of the most hilarious things that I have ever heard of or seen, and it is worth buying this just to see this hilarious plot. Many other things along the way are humorous, and there are scenes where the doc helps sick people.

I find the character Doctor Martin Bahnford to be a very interesting because he can be very nice to people (unlike the one in the TV show), yet still yell at things in humourous ways. Also, a few characters from ""Saving Grace"" are carried over and all of the locals, though they are crazy, are very likable. All great acting.

Anyways, I highly reccomend this to anyone especially if you enjoy the movie ""Saving Grace"", the show ""Doc Martin"", British TV, or just a very good and funny movie.",1344038400,38,1556,4.355172413793103

Those that have the audacity to tell it like it is, like Doc Martin series, and an odd characters are always more interesting to watch, aren't they? I love Martin Clunes, and loved his character in William and Mary as well.  Just expect more from the series, different cast of characters, and the doc is not a people lover.  He does fall in love though..which makes him all the more human.  The movie is the spin off from Saving Grace, which was a fairly good movie..interesting idea though.",1343692800,,663,4.584745762711864

In other words, he lacks the very social ineptitude that makes the reincarnation of Doc Martin so enjoyable.  It's no wonder he underwent a rewrite for his current version.

While he thinks over his situation he meets the Provincials in his location of choice; namely the real Port Isaac, in Cornwall; a small fishing village, almost untouched by the outside world. Very well written, this two part series is the precursor of the very popular five season series named simply, ""Doc Martin"" and it is almost mandatory that you purchase all five seasons as the Doc turns from lovable to irascible in the Jekyll/Hyde manner leading to rollicking good fun and side-splitting humor.  Enough love interest in the most refreshing, and tasteful English manner.  How he settles his personal situation is revealed in the second part of ""Doc Martin - The Movies"". Character development of the cast of characters is so good you will fall in love with this series and wonder how long they can keep it up.  Not only will you laugh a lot but, if you pay attention, your English language skills will improve; Doc Martins usage is impeccable! The Provincials, on the other hand, will teach you some word you've never heard before. P.S.

I was lucky enough to find the films to buy from Australia a couple of years ago and watch them over and over again,I also completed the trilogy by buying 'Saving Grace' the film that introduced the Dr Martin Character.

That said, I still found the movies charming in their own right and Martin Clunes' acting talent really shines through.  Clunes plays a cigarette-smoking, whiskey-drinking party man with a lot of problems who runs off to Port Isaac as an escape (that's all I will say so as to not give away too much plot).  It's a great character who I find sad, endearing, and revolting at the same time - a huge range that really shows off Clunes' acting.  The characters who live in the village are quirky and not sure what to do with Dr Martin - and thus funny situations emerge.

I recommend this film, but don't get it if you are looking for it to be like the tv show.  Rather, it should stand on it's own as a fun adventure.",1328400000,10,994,4.178010471204188

The first movie started a bit slow for me, and was nearly half over before I made a committment to stick with it. There was a broken marriage plot in it that was not very humorous, and it took me awhile to understand some accents. The second half of that movie was much better. The second film is played more for laughs, and it delivers, and benefits from the viewer now knowing how the doctor got to Cornwall and why.

4516676,5,B0050N0UR0,"Dry, bent, absurd, ridiculous, Could not stop laughing! If they hung ol' Doc for being tactful and courteous, they'd be hanging an innocent man!",1326844800,,144,5.041666666666667
4516677,5,B0050N0UR0,If you've never seen the movies that inspired the series you don't know what your missing. Though this Martin is different from the one arrived at in the series you can see where the final version came from. It was also fun to try to place the other cast of characters in these movies. If you have the series these movies are a must.,1326067200,,333,4.21875
4516678,5,B0050N0UR0,"Martin Clunes is terrific!  When will we see Doc Martin series 5 in the u.s.a.? All the actors are excellent in their roles.  I think Luisa should become pregant in a series and Martin should have morning sickness. (It really happens, you know). Delightful, enchanting, beautiful, hilarious!  We definitely need more ""feel good"" T V like Doc Martin.",1325894400,,349,4.982758620689655
4516679,2,B0050N0UR0,"I'm a hugh fan of the Doc Martin series - Have watched all four seasons and am eagerly awaiting season 5.  In the meantime, I purchased ""Doc Martin, The Movies"" because of my interest in understanding how the PBS series came to be.  Unfortunately, the first disc in the 2 disc set was defective and resulted in a return.  The second disc was fine and so all was not lost but I did so want to see that first movie.",1323388800,,413,4.1375
4516680,5,B0050N0UR0,"Received product promptly.  Good service. Haven't watched it yet but we've enjoyed Saving Grace and the Doc Martin series.  This is not the same Doc Martin depicted in the series, however it is still enjoyable.",1322697600,,210,4.9714285714285715
4516681,5,B0050N0UR0,"This set of Doc Martin movies does not include all the actors in the 4 series season. The ""Doc"" portrayed in this set is a more care free person as opposed to the very abrupt Doctor in  the series. The story line does tie in with the 4 series season. If you are a Martin Clunes/ Doc. Martin fan, and you can adjust to the characteristics I have listed, then you will find the movies very delightful and enjoyable. I enjoyed them very much, and wish they would have 2 Doc Martin series going. One with the grouch, and the other with the care free Doc.  I would enjoy them both. That's my  2 cents. If you don't like it, move on! LOL!",1322179200,5,632,4.121951219512195
4516682,4,B0050N0UR0,"Doc Martin in a good mood is not as funny as his burly successor in the series, but Martin Clunes makes it all worthwhile. There is no actor like him.
But I do miss some of the characters from the series.",1321401600,,204,4.0
4516683,5,B0050N0UR0,"Assuming that most people interested in ""The Movies"" are people who are fans of the Series and are ""looking for more"" on Doc Martin. That's how I came upon this 2 part collection, and I am pretty well pleased with it. The character Doc Martin is, I think, in an evolutionary phase... not quite the character we're all familiar with from the Series... but this is fun to watch all the same.
 So if you're a Doc Martin fan, this is a must-have... but be forewarned! there is s scene toward the beginning of the first film that is a bit off-color... two of the locals are doing the horizontal bop, so to speak. Reminiscent of Series 3 Episode 4.... sort of.
 As I'm typing this up, I think it's been a month or so since I watched it, and I think it's time to give it another spin...
 So there you have it, my five star endorsement with the cautionary clause. Enjoy!",1320710400,4,862,4.276073619631902

4516685,5,B0050N0UR0,"Having been a fan of the TV series this movie caught my attention.  Even though there are several major differences between the two, this movie is well worth watching as long as you don't expect it to be a prequel to the TV program.",1320451200,,232,4.2727272727272725
4516686,5,B0050N0UR0,"Both movies were the best.  Previous reviews helped me to understand the plot and differences in the Doc Martin in these movies and the tv one.  I just wish they had kept a little of the characteristics from this doc martin in the current tv series.  Overall I'm very glad I have everything, the movies and the series 1-4. Fan for life.",1320019200,3,336,4.387096774193548

4516688,5,B0050N0UR0,This series is both interesting and varied in its self contained movies.  The acting by Clunes and cast is able to hold ones imagination.  It is not at all stodgy and the dialect very easy to understand.  It is one of my favorite contemporary British TV series.  We will watch it again.  If you like the Doc Martin series you will love these movies.,1318636800,,349,4.390625
4516689,1,B0050N0UR0,I thought this would be more like the Doc Martin series which it is not.  I was very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend this movie.  Save your money the cost of this DVD isn't worth it.  I am very disappointed in this product and price.,1318636800,3,255,4.270833333333333
4516690,5,B0050N0UR0,One of the funniest series on DVD. It is filled with a cast of eccentric characters and a persistent dog. Each season leaves you wanting more. The scenery is wonderful. I have been to Cornwall and seen coastline just like this.,1318464000,7,227,4.560975609756097

4516692,4,B0050N0UR0,"Nothing can top the Doc Martin shows. Love the scenery, the characters, the story line.

The problem stems from the DVD hanging up or freezing in just about every one of the disks.
Because I want to see the episodes, I put up with it. Some folks might not persevere.
I'm keeping the disks however, because I do enjoy watching them when nothing new is on TV.
The same people put out the movies and the TV series, and I got them all. Same problem
across the board.",1318118400,,462,4.25
