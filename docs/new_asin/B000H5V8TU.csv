8512320,1,B000H5V8TU,"i dunno what the other guy's taking 'bout, but i rented the movie when it 1st came out(from a gas station) figuring it'd be a decent detroit flick. it started off with sam monroe(the guy that gets stomped in menace to society) being picked up at detroit city airport. ANYONE from detroit knows flights from lax go to detroit metro. then it becomes clear it's just a hood film with an bad plot. guy flys in from la to hang with girl, girl's dating another guy in detroit, both guys are beefed out instead of checking the girl. had a scene with a mexican stand off, one of the characters had a knife out...

most of detroit g code is riding around the d, going to various points of interest, such as the broadway, hart plaza & belle isle. yeah, the movie showcases some highpoints, but the script... having spent my teen years listening to big fuze's mixtapes, im wondering why he didn't put that same effort into writing a decent screenplay. the ending is what made me hate the film, but i won't spoil it.",1268611200,,1004,4.397849462365591
8512321,5,B000H5V8TU,...this movie will change history. it defies gravity. it fights terrorism. it pays reparations for slavery. it can be used as currency. its flavor is long-lasting. it worked as a stripper to put itself through college. it invented jealousy. it is always punctual. it speaks 10 different languages.,1159401600,,297,5.208333333333333
