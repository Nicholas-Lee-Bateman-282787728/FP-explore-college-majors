The Incredible Hulk was a hit TV series in the 70's and Anchor Bay Entertainment presents both the Hulk Returns and the classic `How To Draw The Marvel Way'.

With the recent release of the Hulk TV series, the Incredible Hulk is not the appeal of this set.  Many years ago, Big John Busecma and Smiling Stan Lee co-authored `How To Draw the Marvel Way'.  It was a runaway success and still probably sits in many comic collectors collections today!  (Say that twice).  The time has come for the re-release of the 1984 Fireside Book companion.

Clearly, with the original master from 20 years ago, there will be degradation, and there is.  While the images are not as sharp as today's productions, the advice and examples given certainly are!  John Buscema is clearly at the top of his game, while Stan reads his cue cards with the best of them!  Stan is no artist, but with Big John beside him illustrating his way, the Marvel way, Stan can't lose.

From tools to continuity, Stan and John guide young artist wannabes through the paces.  Stan encourages viewers to stop the tape and practise...pause for dramatic effect...now we'd pause the DVD.  Other than comments like that, this is a great buy for the budding artist.  The Hulk is just the bonus.
