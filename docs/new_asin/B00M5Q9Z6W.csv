8670428,5,B00M5Q9Z6W,"This film provides some general knowledge for those interested in the relationship between Islam and Christianity. What is happening in the Muslim world today as it relates to the spread of Christianity?  How can Christians overcome obstacles to sharing their faith with Muslims.

 The greatest value in this project may be its objective view of the value  of all the worlds peoples. God loves all of his creation no matter where they now reside or what they believe and wants to share with them the message of reconciliation through Jesus Christ.",1514678400,,547,4.978021978021978
8670429,5,B00M5Q9Z6W,Informative. Worth watching for anyone with a general or specific interest in religion or sociology. The negative reviewers either did not watch the film or are obtuse.,1512691200,,168,5.2592592592592595
8670430,1,B00M5Q9Z6W,Christian hambonery. The fact that self-indulgent christians abandon their own countries - which are distinctly immoral and irreligious - in an attempt to misguide muslims is reprehensible. What is even worse are the lies in this documentary such as pretending muslims don't even know who Jesus is until some American with a ballcap and fannypack tells them.,1495929600,2,358,5.298245614035087
8670431,1,B00M5Q9Z6W,A slick and lame Christian propaganda film aimed at 'saving' Muslims from their errant religion and converting them to Christianity -- or rather worshipers of the prophet Jesus.,1487808000,3,177,5.357142857142857
8670432,5,B00M5Q9Z6W,Well done balanced historical and very knowledgeable view with current application covering a global range differing beliefs and persuasions. An excellent overview in 56 minutes with 32 minute and 17 minutes versions making it useful in several contexts. This presentation provides depth and substance without overwhelming with too much information following more of a free-flowing illustrated lecture/narrative format in contrast to a drama format.,1421107200,5,449,6.03125
8670433,5,B00M5Q9Z6W,This was such a helpful piece of work! Well documented with some insightful interviews and actually going to the contexts to film. Well done! May it help us have a better understanding of Islam and those who follow it.,1416873600,2,218,4.615384615384615
