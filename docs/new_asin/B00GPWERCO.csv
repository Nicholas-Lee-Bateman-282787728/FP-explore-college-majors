6098035,5,B00GPWERCO,"Absolutely breathtaking! I honestly could not give it enough stars. 5 seems way too low! The work put into this, the quality and just the over all ""storyline"" is amazing. I would suggest this to anyone who is a fan of documentaries, bears and just loves a heartwarming tale.",1408060800,,274,4.612244897959184
6098036,5,B00GPWERCO,It's amazing. You haven't lived til you've seen it.,1405641600,,51,4.777777777777778
6098037,5,B00GPWERCO,"You know how nature documentaries used to be, with the prolonged shots showing a creature doing its daily business, with emotionless narration, dry facts about how the creature operates, and dull music?  I figured this would be sort of that way but was still really looking forward to the beautiful landscapes and learning more about how bears function.  Well, not only did it have the things I expected, but it was even better, because the narration is written with great levity and humor and narrated in the most colorful way imaginable by John C. Reilly!  Less than two months after seeing it in the theater, I already am ready for it to come out on DVD/Blu-ray.  The scenery is very, very beautiful, and the narration makes it even more enjoyable.  (I also never thought I could LIKE bears, because I always thought of 'em as scary and smelly.  I think it's interesting that when they filmed it in Alaska, the bears didn't feel threatened at all by the presence of humans.  Maybe most creatures LEARN to be mean.)  It feels like an adventure story more than like a straightforward nature documentary.  I really love how it was done.",1402099200,16,1136,4.696969696969697
6098038,5,B00GPWERCO,"It almost seems unatural to call this a documentary as much as this is a pure feast for the eyes, and it was obviously intended so. This is a must see on a big screen. Each shot is carefully thought out and executed as brilliant photography stretches the limits from beginning to the end of this quaint little tale of a mother bear raising, defending, and nurturing her two beloved bear cubs through their first year of life into the next blossoming winter. Despite all odds of survival in the open wilderness, she battles starvation, predators, and mother nature herself all under the watchful eye of the cinematographers who know what they are doing at each step. Great scenes from beginning to end with kid friendly dialogue that may put off scientific purists because this is intended for family viewing and enjoyment. Walt Disney would be overwhelmingly proud!",1399939200,3,865,4.851351351351352
6098039,5,B00GPWERCO,"The grandkids loved it. The photography was beautiful. The narration kid friendly. I had the opportunity to spend some time at one of the filming locations, Hallo Bay Wilderness camp, for the experience of a lifetime. The film captures the amazing bears and their lives. If you can't get there, see this to taste the excitement.",1399334400,,328,4.875
6098040,5,B00GPWERCO,"Bears was one of the better documentaries Ive seen in a long time. This comes as no surprise considering it was produced by Walt Disney.  The film follows a mother Alaskan Kodiak Brown Bear and her cubs as they awake from hibernation and journey to find food during the spring and summer. I was in complete awe of how they were able to capture such footage of the bears on camera.  One particular scene that comes to mind is at the beginning when they show in full color the bears in hibernation.  There was no night vision or monotone lamps used just full HD color.  Id never seen this before.  One amazing fact I learned was that the mother eats 90 lbs. of salmon EACH DAY in the spring and summer months leading up to the long, cold winter.  They dig dens at the TOP of the mountain only to wake up in the spring and begin their long trek down to the beaches and bases of the river.  When the camera pans across the Alaskan wilderness its really breathtaking.  All of the wildness is National Forestry and its beautiful seeing the bears completely free and open out in the wild.  I love this film and John C. Reilly was an awesome narrator and reminded me of the guy from The Adventures of Milo and Otis. If you haven't already seen this film I HIGHLY recommended going to see it in theaters while you can.  Its packed with incredible footage, lots of factual information and a great story everyone is sure to enjoy. (4/4 Stars)",1398902400,16,1431,4.366037735849057
6098041,5,B00GPWERCO,"DisneyNature is back for another Earth Day release, this time about Alaskan brown bears and their struggle for survival. Narrated by actor John C. Reilly, Bears takes the viewer to the Alaskan wilderness, a land where harsh weather and even harsher realities shape the day to day lives of the few animals brave enough to call this area home.

Bears focuses its time on a mother bear named Sky and her two young cubs, Amber and Scout. The documentary shows the two babies shortly after birth and follows them on their post- hibernation journey from mountain cave to chilly streams flowing with tasty salmon. There are plenty of dangers along the way. Wolves and other bears are always lurking about and a mother bear must remain vigilant to these threats at all times.

This documentary, like the others in the DisneyNature series, is highly educational and great for the entire family. The documentary takes on a serious tone, for the most part, but there are several humorous moments that will get children giggling and adults smiling. This is good and necessary because there are some segments of the documentary that could be a little scary for kids. The humor helps to put viewers back in a good mood and helps relieve the tense moments.

Bears is great for its educational value, but even if you're not all that interested in animals and their day to day lives, there is one other reason to watch Bears, and that is for the amazing cinematography. The scenery is magnificent and to watch these massive brown bears against the snowy backdrop of mountains is truly a sight to behold. Just watching the scenery sets your imagination soaring and it could convince some viewers to consider a family vacation to this region of Alaska, just to marvel at its natural beauty.

Bears are powerful animals. But being large and strong does not mean that life is easy and trouble free. Bears shows that the life of a mother bear is difficult every step of the way and that finding food and protecting her cubs is a constant challenge. Its a very good documentary both for its educational value and for its amazing cinematography and I recommend it to all.",1398038400,25,2147,4.732620320855615

The whole story became even more impressive when we saw the little bit of background footage, showing the lengths the crew had to go to in order to find, and follow the main family of bears.

6098066,4,B00GPWERCO,"This is the first wildlife documentary I've watched that focused on bears.  I mostly watch big cat documentaries, so I thought it would make for an interesting change to watch this one.  I'm very glad that I decided to give it a shot and I truly did enjoy learning more about bears and how they raise their cubs.  For me the only downside was their choice of narrator.  John C Riley has a distinctive voice, which is great for a documentary.  The downside is that he's a comedian, his tone conveys humor frequently and I had a hard time taking the film seriously.

I've come to love the presentation of Big Cat Diary that mixes a small amount of humor with a more serious and educational approach.  There are certainly times where he would talk about bear's habits and behavior, but I would have preferred an expert on the subject narrate instead.  Perhaps they only needed to tweak the script a bit, but it just wasn't nearly as good as African Cats for me.",1455235200,,958,4.4655172413793105

6098068,4,B00GPWERCO,This movie is so cute! I love watching the bears. The narrator gets annoying after a while but I guess he is trying to keep the attention of children. That is really the only thing I don't like about it.,1454112000,,203,4.1

6098079,5,B00GPWERCO,"Great movie for children up to 7 years old. It may not entertain older kids. It's a cute movie, don't expect a thrilled 100% action exciting movie, although it has some of it but it's mild. I read the low ratings on this movie and I gotta say that those people are ridiculous, taking offense on the smallest insignificant things. If you want to edit how the real world is make your own film!. There is no sensual innuendos. There are no images or scenes of bears mating in this film nor explicit talks about it! Everything was presented in a very appropriate manner.",1449446400,,566,4.451923076923077

6098094,5,B00GPWERCO,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. My 4 year old daughter is not interested in TV much but she loves shows about real animals (not cartoons). She and I both love this movie! It is the story of a bear family in Alaska and what they do every day to find food and stay safe. It is absolutely appropriate for preschool aged kids, with just a few parts with loud bear roaring. The narration by John C. Reilly is excellent - easy to hear and funny at times. The scenery in BluRay is stunning, right up there with the Planet Earth series. Get this and watch it with your family!",1435622400,,585,4.185840707964601

6098096,1,B00GPWERCO,"Major disappointment, Yes, the Alaska scenery and filming were excellent but even these weren't enough to rate more than 1 star. The narration was beyond terrible, The movie is probably suggested for children age 3 and up; would you want your 3 year old hearing about bears who ""have to get their game on"" and other ridiculous sexual innuendo about chasing tail? Come on, Disney, for young children?

Aside from the lewd sexual references, the narration was so boring I could hardly get through it. Do you think watching this will give your kids a scientific learning experience? The first few minutes of the film discuss ""smelly"" bears and the disgusting hibernation den when that has nothing to do with the reality of bear experience. This film is sadly Americanized bs. It's sad to think what people will put up with these days, and worse, accept for their children.  .",1435017600,3,872,4.806666666666667

Filmed in Katmai National Park, Alaska, it follows a mother bear and her two cubs who emerge from their den in the spring and then proceed to make their way to eventually partake in the annual salmon run which in a few short weeks time, feeds the bears and provides sustenance for them to make it through another winter. The cubs are given personalities, in true Disney fashion, and given kid's voices with which they communicate throughout their travels and troubles. They are never in extreme danger and.....SPOILER ALERT......everything is ok in the end. Enjoy the scenery. Enjoy the bears. Children will love this. Many adults will too.

6098132,4,B00GPWERCO,"My wife baffles me.  She hates animals.  She has banned them from our home.  She makes us all strip at the door if weve been in the home of anyone who owns animals.  She shuts down any conversation about owning them.  When we are at a friends home and they own pets she avoids them like the plague, talks about how awful they are and begs our friends to get rid of them.  I know, this should make her a terrible person, right?  But, shes also quite fascinated by them, and from a distance she adores them.  Its strange, but she makes our kids watch nature shows every Saturday morning and drags the whole family to those awful IMAX movies that play in our local museum that are basically the most boring depictions of wildlife put to film, with someone like Morgan Freeman explaining every single detail to us; ad-nauseam.  She pleads with us to go to the cinema anytime Disney decides they want to create a fake family of animals to document for our enjoyment.  She did it with that Chimpanzee movie and I wanted to kill her (my god, that movie was awful) and she did it again with Bears.

Well, she almost did it.

In fact, the film came out and I refused to suffer in the theater for this movie and so we waited until it was released on DVD.  She kept prodding me every week, has it come out yet? and I prayed wed never find it, and then we did find it and I wound up sleeping through the whole thing.  I needed a nap.  I was exhausted.  The next morning my kids wanted to watch it again, and I was kind of shocked because they usually complain about these kinds of movies despite my wifes constant insistence that they are wonderful films, and so my interest was slightly piqued to the point where I decided to laze it on the couch with the kids and watch the movie Id snored through the night before.

This is in no way shape or form a benchmark for documentary filmmaking, but it is in no way shape or form as pointless, silly and pandering as that awful Chimpanzee.

The thing I hated so much about Chimpanzee is that it felt like it tried way too hard to make this documentary a movie.  It gave awful names to these apes and gave them backstories that felt forced and it fed in conflict that felt anticlimactic and overly dramatized and it focused on inane things, trying to give it meaning beyond the obvious and by the end of the movie it felt so pointless that it might as well have just been scrapped altogether for an animated film about chimpanzees, since thats really what they wanted to do.  My fear for Bears was that it was going to suffer from the same construction issues, but it doesnt, at least not wholly.

Bears, narrated by one of my favorite underappreciated actors, John C. Reilly, tells the story of a mother bear and her two cubs and their journey from hibernation caves to life giving streams of the open valleys.  From first step to last, the journey is dangerous, exciting and rewarding, and the way in which directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey capture this journey (the cinematography is stunning) is a very solid and touching experience.  There are some moments that feel overwrought, and this is Disney, and so the film does suffer from a saccharine glaze at points, but for a family wanting to educate their children while entertaining them, this is actually really well done.  The weight of the average journey taken on by these majestic creatures is captured in a way that will educate, captivate and touch your whole family.",1421107200,,3475,4.444794952681388

I highly recommend it and the violence and it is not a big deal there are a couple scenes where a beer goes at it with another beer but they quickly do a change over so there is really no bloodshed of violence for your child to worry about.

The cinematography is beautiful but I found the narration ridiculous and it detracted from the entire experience. Other people have reviewed how funny and enjoyable it was but, for me, it bordered on silly at parts and the way in which they manage to depict the mother bear, it's a wonder that she and her cubs could survive. I mean for the better part of the movie she couldn't catch a fish if they were jumping into her mouth and supposedly her poor cubs were in danger of starving and thank goodness they finally found their way to the 'Golden Pond' in time. I had wanted to love it and enjoy watching it more than once but unless my 5 year old asks, and she hasn't, I'm not rushing to put it back on.",1412121600,2,858,4.3354037267080745

6098215,5,B00GPWERCO,Let me start by stating what this is not: It is not David Attenborough and although made by the BBC nature team it is not at all like a BBC nature documentary. It is a fun film aimed squarely at the 3 - 13 age bracket with a good overlap into mums and dads. No animal gets hurt apart from some salmon who are eaten and there is lots of light dialogue that manages to avoid the cheesy levels many previous Disney films descended to. It is a delightful film about a mother bear and her two cubs during their first year and it is most beautifully filmed. The extras are good two. My only active dislike was the ghastly song used in the film but then I am almost certainly the wrong generation for that! This is a perfect film to use to introduce young children to the great outdoors. My copy heads for my grandchildren and I know they will love it.,1409011200,2,845,4.158536585365853

6098217,5,B00GPWERCO,"I am a huge fan of Disneynature! The first time I watched one I wasn't so sure what they would be like but in true Disney form, these movies are incredible. Disneynature Bears follows a Mama Bear and her cubs for a year in their  journey through life and you feel like you are on an adventure with them.
Mama Bear Sky travels with Amber and Scout, her adorable cubs and they face danger and challenges along the way.  The terror and beauty of an avalanche are captured and the cinematography is incredible as it's shot from all different angles.

The music appropriately narrates the story when the narrator himself isn't talking. The narration is done in such a way that it's completely appropriate for young children. I watched this with  my five year old daughter and was surprised that she sat and watched the whole thing with me. That just speaks volumes for Disney when  they can captivate the attention of a child on a non cartoon, documentary type of movie.

There are a few tense moments but nothing really scary for the little ones. There was a moment that had me worried one of the cubs was going to be killed but I should have known better. Paige was worried when Bears fought or danger was lurking but not really scared.

The views in Alaska are breathtaking and even though my daughter was primarily captivated by the Bears, she was in awe of the mountains and snow and all of the scenery.

These bears are adorable and you and your kids will fall in love with them on their spirited adventure in the beautiful Alaska in Disneynature's Bears.",1408752000,,1556,4.5321428571428575

What is always amazing is how well and how close the filmmakers are able to get to the animals they are following. The other thing that is wonderful is the story that is shared as you feel that you are connected to the bears in this movie. The movie is family friendly and my kids were enamored by the bears, how they lived, played, ate and more. This movie teaches all who watch it so much about the Bears and what their lives are really like. You also get lost in the beauty of the nature/environment that the bears live in. Get ready to be endeared to this family of Bears and leave with a much great appreciation for these animals and for the world in which we live. Very well made film and one that I highly encourage all families to watch together!

6098219,5,B00GPWERCO,"This is yet another great movie from Disney. It is educational as well as entertaining. It is suitable for young children, as there is no killing in it. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by all. An added bonus is that for every Bears movie purchased the Wildlife Foundation gets a percentage  of the sale.",1408579200,11,305,4.350877192982456
6098220,5,B00GPWERCO,"Its a good idea to keep the Disneynature videos handy when someone in the house says, Theres nothing good on TV for the kids! This one is sure thing to please everyone, as it has big and little fluffy bears. They fight occasionally and the mother breast feeds (just in case seeing bear boobies on TV are a concern) but the experts and filmmakers explain in the bonus features that bears get a bad rap for being nothing else but fierce killers.

While they're not Yogi and Boo-Boo either, the bears we get to know in this gorgeous film are intelligent, strategic, loving, focused and loaded with personality. While this film follows the Disney True-Life Adventures tradition of attaching a narrative to the edited footage, nothing is bogus. You spend a year with a mother and her female and male cubs as they travel the rugged but pictaresque Alaskan countryside in a quest for salmonsettling for other, less substantial foods along the way, and getting into tangles with predators, including bears like them whose hunger drives them to the brink of killing their own species.

The cubs are so adorable and the mother so devoted, this is a fine movie to watch together. As the narrator, John C. Reilly maintains a jaunty, gently humorous tone, interjecting facts so seamlessly that it doesnt come off as dry and lecture-y. (One wonders how much of his just a dude watching the movie with you style narration is improvised.)

Its likely that anyone watch Bears is going to say, perhaps more than once, How did they film that? There is a bonus feature with that name, along with other short docs about the bears, the filming and the rough terrain trodden by the movie crew. Most fascinating is that the filming rarely took place a great distance from the bears. Within the protective boundaries of the sprawling preserve, the bears were never hunted or threatened by humans so were very comfortable being around people, as long as the skilled guides kept them calm off camera and the crews food was contained (more of this is explained on one of the bonus features). Jane Goodall even makes an appearance, visiting the crew and guides during their expedition.

Disneynature is an outstanding, spectacular and highly entertaining series of films. Bears is a worthy addition to the library.",1408492800,,2285,4.821428571428571
