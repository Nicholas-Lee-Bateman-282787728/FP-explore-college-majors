1653241,5,B00005R5GD,they don't make movies like this anymore. Lamar Dickey is just another wide eyed wet behind the ears rookie cop or so it would seem to his partner.this  movie takes a very Hitchcock like turn and suddenly the detective investigating the bank owners murder is now the prime suspect!,1068940800,2,281,4.73469387755102
1653242,4,B00005R5GD,"Very good movie . I have to worn you - if you expecting regular , happy ending Hollywood cheapy , you are in wrong place .
 Ed Harris playing a police homoside detective . His character is street smart , talanted , but very lonly . His partner is young and kind of laisy .One evening , Harris meet a beatifull woman ( Madelein Stowe ), and we fell in love with her character right away : smart , very attractive , intellegent and funny . So did the detective . She dissapears that evening , but Harris find her , of cause . The relationship developes and getting more and more interesting every scene . But everything goes not that easy for tham - she is married . Producers made an exellent selection of an actor for the role of her husband ( we dislike him right away ). He ownes a big Florida bank chain , cheating on his beatifull wife and pushing her around constantly . We know right away - something will happen , somebody going to get killed . And most likely , this someone will be her husband .
 What I like in this movie , is the love story between Harris and Stowe . Both actors perform on such high level , that keeps your attention from begining all the way to the end . We want them to be together . And when Stowe get in big troubles , we want Harris to help her .
 At same time we have to think ,That she is just seting him up , but we want to belive her . We WANT to belive that she loves Harris character . And at the last moments of the movie , insted of being sad about the ending , we feal relief - this was a true love .
 Highly recomended.",1031961600,22,1563,3.9523809523809526
1653243,5,B00005R5GD,"Ed Harris is always better than his material. Madeleine Stowe's sexy performance would get a rise out of a stone idol. This movie reminds me of ""Casablanca"" inasmuch as it was done as a low budget not-well-advertised film. But with this cast and excellent direction it crackles and cooks on-screen. Once in a while you find a movie that kind of ""got lost"" in distribution but turns out to be a surprisingly good experience. Harris goes for Stowe in a big way and I believe, so would any other man. Watching Stowe is easily the equal of a double-Viagra dose; trust me.",1012521600,26,567,4.568627450980392

1653302,5,B00005R5GD,"This modern film noir takes you into a world of intrigue and betrayal. Ed Harris plays a cop who should know better while Ms. Stowe is a femme fatale who may have ulterior motives. Supporting their endeavor with every subtlety imaginable is a young Benicio del Toro. These three keep you transfixed as things go from bad to worse. The question is, who's fooling who? The threads unravel in seemingly expected ways, but just when you think you have it all worked out, one after another breaks in ways you wouldn't have expected. Our hero/anti hero can't quite figure it out until its far too late, which really keeps you guessing. The ending hurts, as it should in this kind of movie. Nobody wins, which is what film noir, and sometimes life, is all about. Worth your money and time, enjoy this movie!",1408233600,,800,4.601398601398602

1653329,3,B00005R5GD,"This film is a take off on the movie ""Body Heat"" but it is not as good as that film.  It does have some of the same elements.  A rich woman, who is alluring tempts a straight arrow police officer and he helps her dispose of her husband's body after she shoots the husband.  The husband is a controlling creep played by Charles Dance and the police officer, played by Ed Harris, goes against all that he has ever practiced as a police officer to help cover up a murder.  This is supposedly done out of blind love and loyalty.  Ed Harris comes across as a stupid man who is manipulated by a very screwd and beautiful woman played by Madeline Stowe.

It goes without saying that the whole cover up falls apart in the end and Benicio Del Toro is the person who keeps after Ed Harris and Madeline Stowe until it unravels.  Not surprisingly, Del Toro is an accomplice to Stowe.  Her ambition is to become rich from her late husband's fortune.  The husband is not a sympathetic character as he beats his wife and also attempts to control her in other ways.  Madeline Stowe sets out to ensnare Ed Harris in her plot and she does succeed.  She is a fine actress and shows it in this movie but she is not Kathleen Turner (""Body Heat"").

This movie is worth viewing and it does have some good scenes but as a whole,  this cannot be considered an excellent movie as it is just too predictable.  There is really not much suspense in it and hardly any humor to soften it.  The main characters do a good job but certainly the script is weak.  Like ""Body Heat"" the movie is set in Florida and it is very hot.",1366329600,,1592,4.256666666666667

The difference is that Ed Harris is a murder detective but doesn't know what he's up against. He's put in the position to cover up a murder that he didn't commit but would ultimately implicate him. But the killer isn't telling him everything...

Stowe is a great femme Fatale in this early 90's film starring Benicio Del Toro and Wayne Shorter. In a city where the majority of city blocks are occupied by industrial sectors of DeDonde Inc., conspiracies are frequently started for various reasons. In a town where cops help criminals and criminals help cops, Ed Harris is up against a web of deceit and confusion. He's the best man for the job, but is the ""job"" designed to frame him for MURDER? Madeline Stowe isn't telling him everything, and his detective partner Del Toro may have some cards up his sleeve as well.
Shorter is a local bar owner who sees it all, trying to help Harris before it's too late without letting Del Toro know the score, not to mention Stowe. With the help of a local inventor-gone-mad, Shorter is given a device that will help Ed Harris freeze time and therefore understand why all evidence points to him as the killer. (The device was intended for DeDonde Inc.) But Shorter is also double-crossed when MICHAELmATICIAN uses the device against him at the bar (in an effort to win a game of pool). Will Harris beat the rap? Will Shorter prove that it was Stowe?

China Moon is real, as is the Michrotron. MICHAELmATICIAN states that we must learn to see the Michrotron at once. China Moon is also recommended.

1653336,5,B00005R5GD,"This 1994 film is a fast paced, tense and passionate tale about a love affair that grows increasingly complex and dangerous as the story moves on.  Ed Harris, in a stellar performance, is cast as a homicide detective whose eye for detail is something to be admired.  Benico Del Toro is cast as his sidekick with a lot to learn and the two seem to make a good pair.  Enter the femme fatal - Madeline Stow.  She's beautiful and troubled but Harris falls hard for her.  She's trapped in a loveless abusive marriage to a wealthy man who cheats on her and treats her badly.  It seems weird that she stays with him even though she and Ed Harris fall in love.  The plot moves very quickly though and I was pulled right into the story as it progressed to include deception and murder as well as surprises that I never saw coming.

I enjoyed this film though all its twists and turns. The acting was excellent.  The pacing just right to hold my interest and the ending was creative although a bit unbelievable.  Basically though I really enjoyed it.",1293926400,,1040,4.426315789473684
1653337,5,B00005R5GD,"I watched China Moon shortly after it was originally released on DVD. My motivation for watching it was Ebert's review on Siskel and Ebert, the television show. I recall Ebert stating (I'm paraphrasing)...

'Everybody wants to make a film noir but few of them actually WORK. Here's one that does. I honestly did not know what was going to happen until the final frame.'

Agreed. Tightly written, flawless script that rivals the Coen film, Blood Simple---my personal all time favorite noir. I'd also take China Moon over Bound, the excellent Wachowski film, that takes a bit too long in it's first 1/2 hour in my opinion, to reveal the major ensuing conflict.

Bailey's direction of the film: Beautifully restrained, measured, minimalistic. Great, minimal use of sountrack as well---powerfully used in keys scenes.

The acting by Stowe and Harris makes Hurt and Turner in Body Heat appear staged, forced, at times absurd, by comparison.

China Moon: A TRULY GREAT AMERICAN FILM.

CHINA MOON is perhaps spoiled by a too-familiar storyline.
It's a neo-noir, with Ed Harris as homicide detective Kyle Brodin. He falls for Rachel Munro (Stowe) a married woman who's being abused by her banker husband (Chance). When the man is murdered, Harris must investigate. Rachel admits her guilt to Kyle and he chooses to cover up the crime rather than turn her in. But then suspicion falls squarely on Kyle himself.

1653340,4,B00005R5GD,"China Moon is an entertaining film with fine performances by Ed Harris and Madeleine Stowe; it also has a good score by George Fenton.  My only comment is as follows: The main police investigation in the film revolves around the difference between the diameters of 38 Special and 9mm bullets.  The fact of the matter is that there's no difference between the diameters of these two bullets; both 38 Special and 9mm bullets are .357 inch in diameter; in other words, 38 Special bullet diameter is also 9 millimeter.  The 38 Special is not to be confused with the ordinary 38 caliber.  The gun in question in the movie is a 38 Special, as in fact mentioned in one scene by the police captain when he's talking with Ed Harris.",1250208000,3,723,4.538461538461538
1653341,5,B00005R5GD,"I was really impressed with the movie ""China Moon"". The DVD quality is excellent, with outstanding picture quality. In this movie, Ed Harris stars as Kyle Bodine, a Florida police detective who's been in the business a long time and has been teamed up with Lamar Dickey, played by Benicio del Torro, as his new partner. One night at a local bar, Kyle spots Rachel, played by Madeleine Stowe, and is immediately smitten. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out what will happen next. Suffice it here to say they begin an affair, but Rachel is married.

The scene that impressed me most was the one out on the lake, when they are out in the canoe under that brilliant moon, with the water shining in the moonlight. It's really stunning visual imagery and the director did an outstanding job of using this scene to help create real chemistry between Harris and Stowe. They seemed to relate well anyway, and were highly believable as being in love. Charles Dance also gives an outstanding performance as Stowe's highly abusive banker husband; he gives you the chills just by looking at him.

If you are looking for a romantic suspense thriller with real chemistry and stunning visual imagery, plus excellent acting, I highly recommend ""China Moon."" It is one to hang onto and watch over and over.",1245542400,6,1299,4.743362831858407
1653342,3,B00005R5GD,"I don't know, I don't think it merits more than three stars, in spite of one terrific cast.  The plot is not that original and the ending is terribly unsatisfying, even if it is perhaps more true to life.  Ed Harris looks great here, but the one to watch is his partner, Benicio Del Toro, who was Rosie Perez' husband in ""Fearless"".  This was filmed before ""Blink"" which also starred Stowe.  Was set in Florida and the house they used - the outside - was georgeous, with one of those wrap-around porches.  I kept wondering throughout why they made such a point of showing Stowe's wedding ring flashing.  It was distracting since nothing came of it.  And no mention of how Stowe connected to Del Toro at all.  They don't seem to move in the same circles.  Also doesn't make sense that her husband wouldn't give her anything in a divorce, because she had some very incriminating pictures taken of him in bed with the blond hired by Del Toro, who worked at Dance's bank.  And how did they connect up?  She stood to get more by going for being Dance's next wife. Lots of questions; no answers.",1143417600,2,1089,4.44949494949495

Ed Harris falls in love with a femme fatale (the seductive Madeleine Stowe) . She is a married woman and obviosuly all the consequences derivated from this affair will be a real elevator to the gallow.
The surrounding atmosphere is dark and the dramatic nucleus of the picture with the rain as a background seems anticipate the demons that will get out from the Pandora box.
Ed Harris is superb like the policeman who slow but progressively watchs how his efforts for avoid to be discovered as the cover woman become ashes.
The somber role of this double face cop played by Benicio del Toro was a hit for him.
Madeleine Stowe is perfect. She is still one of the most beatiful actress in the cinema , but her shame gaze shines with amazing realism. She reminds me too much to a spanish actress called Ana Torrent (Thesis) .
It's hard  to forget the long tradition of the film noir in the american cinema . The two most remarkable triumphs given in the
eighties were Body Heat and The Black Widow.
However, the director John Bailey assumed the challenge and won the match with this film.
