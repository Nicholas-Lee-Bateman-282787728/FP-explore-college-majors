7999233,3,B0000CG8AP,"The order came in a few days. The disc is fine and unscratched but the case could have at least been changed considering there were stickers from a dvd clearance at a rental shop, plus the case doesn't hold the disc properly and it keeps falling out but overall a good buy.",1387670400,,273,4.269230769230769
7999234,5,B0000CG8AP,Wonderfully dark anime series. I remember staying up until early in the morning to watch it. It's very sad but the story is pretty unique and is great if you love getting into the sci-fi part of anime.,1386892800,,201,4.315789473684211
7999235,2,B0000CG8AP,"Episodes 8-10, 3rd disc of 4

This is the weakest volume of the series.  Episode 8 is strictly a clip show summarizing the previous 7 episodes.  You can't skip this disc though, as it resolves the plotline of Mitsuko's mother.  Hmm, actually, maybe you can skip it.

2.5 stars rounded down.",1304121600,,290,4.607843137254902
