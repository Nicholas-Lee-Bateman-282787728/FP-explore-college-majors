8387479,5,B0032FPZ3W,"The main character of the film is happily married but when his wife goes away on a business trip he allows himself to be seduced by a neighbor. What should have been a one night stand turns into a nightmare as he begins to realize just how unstable she is and what lengths she will go to ensure that they can be together. Some good Boston scenery, especially the original Cheers bar. It is hard to believe that the director of the film is only 16 years old! This is a fun creative film that celebrates the bygone era of the beginning of film. This is what film making should be about. Very good pacing, great cutting and editing. This kid really has potential.",1262649600,,660,4.330645161290323
