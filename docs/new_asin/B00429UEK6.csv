It could have been made better, but hey, how many videos are the on the Holy House of Loreto, are there any at all?  That said I can't ding it too much.  The Catholic Faith is endlessly wonderful.  I love how God allows so many miraculous happenings that the Faithful can believe in, while the people who think they are so above things can find a million reasons to laugh at.  But isn't that just what Jesus said would happen?  You bet.",1512864000,,538,4.174757281553398

8413276,5,B00429UEK6,This is an intriguing video that explores the tradition of its reception in Italy with other explanations.  It ultimately favors that traditional understanding as the most cogent explanation.  Well done.,1420156800,,203,5.733333333333333
8413277,5,B00429UEK6,This is very informational and famiy-friendly.  No violent re-enactments or anything immodest.  We watched this with our small children and nobody was scared/scandalized at any point.  This is very educational and flows like a documentary with minor re-enactments. Great for a Sunday afternoon family movie.,1365465600,4,307,5.777777777777778

8413279,1,B00429UEK6,"The documentary starts with a review of the traditional view of how the house (where supposedly the Virgin Mary lived) was transported from Palestine to Italy by angels, and then goes with a more modern view of a human-made transportation, backed by some priests. However, from there the documentary goes down, trying very hard to support the ""angelic transportation"". No proof of angels moving the house is given. Instead, the ""professor"" (supporting the theory) mostly appeals to documents issued by several Popes and to the several shrines/churches created in each site where supposedly the angels left the house (for different periods of time). A lot of questions arise: (1) why god had to move the house to protect it (from Muslims taken over Jerusalem)? The all-powerful lord could protect it using other means (killing all Muslims in Jerusalem, creating a power field around the house, etc.); (2) why the angels moved the house to different places from time to time to finally leave it in Italy? (an omniscient creator should know what would happen in each place and decide to move the house directly to its safe, final location); (3) three walls where moved, but not the 4th side, a rocky mountain side, why god didn't move that part also? he surely can!; (4) there are shrines/churches commemorating the ""transportation"" in every place where the tradition marks the house stood... but are there any other shrines/churches commemorating the same transportation on places where supposedly the house wasn't located?; (5) why I spent time watching this crappy ""documentary""? that's the question!",1324857600,2,1600,5.157692307692308
8413280,5,B00429UEK6,"An excellent short documentary on the Holy house of Loreto. The makers have taken the sufficient pains to present two sides of the legend of Loreto; A modern hypothesis that rules out the miraculous and has been promulgated in the past 30 years (according to the documentary) and the traditional story that to me is the real and clear winner and debunks the modern theories. The interviews with various personalities are very interesting and full of facts which include:
1) The house of Our Lady in Nazareth
2) The translation of the holy house
  -modern theory
  -traditional story
3) Architecture
4) Complete historical overview.

In short: Excellent, informative and concise.",1298246400,7,678,5.127272727272727
