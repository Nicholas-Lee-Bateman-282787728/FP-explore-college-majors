8176605,5,6302642469,"""Comic Book Capers"" and ""Brush With Oblivion"" are two of the finest DD episodes, mainly for how creative they are; ""Capers"" keeps changing its tone and story depending on who's writing Darkwing's comic, while ""Brush"" keeps changing its visual style depending on what painting the group is venturing through.  Good stuff, and never boring.  It doesn't hurt that Walt Disney Australia handled both episodes, who happens to be one of my favorite overseas studios.

Plus, ""Brush"" isn't available on DVD yet, so it's worth picking up even if you have the two DVD sets.

Word of warning:  A certain wikia lists the other episode on this VHS tape as ""Paint Misbehavin'"", which is incorrect.  Just pointing out false info.",1390089600,,714,4.957983193277311
8176606,5,6302642469,"Very great video! First in COMIC BOOK CAPERS, Darkwing Duck writes about how he beats bad guy Megavolt, but his friends won't stop bugging him long enough to  let him complete his comic book! Then in A BRUSH WITH OBLIVION,Splatter Phoenix zaps Darkwing  into some very cool but dangerous paintings,like a painting of real hungrey t-rex, you'll never know what painting he'll get zaped into next as he attempts to stop the evil Splatter Phoenix from stealing the Mona Lisa smile!",1322438400,2,478,4.888888888888889
8176607,5,6302642469,"This VHS has been out for pretty much 12 years now as of this writing, and the memories are still as how I remember them watching these when I was a kid.

Darkwing Duck was pretty much, next to Talespin, among the greatest shows Disney has created. Darkwing Duck came out during Disney's renowned ""Golden Age"" of animation back in the early 90's, and therefore had all the excuses to ride high, super-hero-with-a-twist, mass marketing (at the time) and good ratings.

This VHS is probably among the better of the other Darkwing Duck releases out there. There are two episodes on these, ""Comic Book Capers"" and ""Brush With Oblivion"". Still as fresh today as when released back then.

A great tape to own for your Disney collection.",1124496000,4,730,4.732283464566929
