1644520,4,B00005Q4FT,"My children ages 4 and 6 enjoy this film.  I'd also recommend ""Bob the Builder A Christmas to Remember.""  That was the first Bob film we purchased and I can't tell you how many times we've played it.  Elton John is in it and it's a hoot.  I have found that that films with Neil Morrissey as the voice of Bob are more enjoyable to my children than the ones with some other person doing Bob's voice.",1166486400,4,397,4.116883116883117
