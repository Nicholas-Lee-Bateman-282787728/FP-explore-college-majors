2789699,4,B000O3C538,"First I will admit that Mike Epps is a comical genius when doing the Hosting thing.  Def Comedy Jam did put together an interesting set of performers because it made you want to watch an entire episode and not just skip over certain performers.

Overall, I give this Set the ""One to Watch"" and mainly because they have an entire set of performers that are on Top of Their Game.  Big Ups to Mr. Epps & Mr. Simmons.",1188432000,16,413,4.269230769230769

8182736,5,B000O3C538,"Surprisingly these CDs hold up very well, even 7 years later.  Mind you, there are parts in there that you have to think about, being that CD was made 7 years ago, but the comedy is timeless for Aries Spears, Mike Epps, Bill Bellamy, Leslie, et. al.
Thank you folks for making us laugh",1401321600,3,285,4.277777777777778
