7554300,5,B018RCYLJ8,"I think Neal forgot a conspiracy. About 20 years ago (or possibly more) the men behind the curtain decided that good music will not be allowed to be played on the radio ever again so that people's moral will sink into oblivian. I turned off my radio for good around that time in a desperate attempt to avoid the discordant cacophony that was blasting forth every time I turned it on.

I have been starving for good music ever since, trying to live on old classics on Youtube for comfort. Thank God this came along..Finally something NEW I can watch/listen to over and over again in total bliss every time - just like the good old days.

My elatedness does not just extend to the music either - the video portion is so perfectly choreographed, and iconoclastic and original and humorous and intense and poignant and, well, you get the gist.

Bottom line - you can tell a lot of heart, soul, talent and wisdom went into this production and it shows big time.",1450915200,2,956,4.482758620689655
7554301,5,B018RCYLJ8,"Neal Fox is not afraid to use his talents to change the world; hes been doing it for over 20 years. An accomplished songwriter, composer, musician, singer, visual and video artist, Neals first salvo came in the form of a musical called Meat Street in which a future earth is under the control of psychiatrists. But two characters in the play disagree with the status quo and have other ideas. Not only is this a great story, but the music is phenomenal (and is available as a 2-CD set from Neals web site or CDBaby.com).

Fast forward to the present where Neal takes on the political, financial and social mysteries of this planet with a highly-original and hard-hitting multimedia tour de force: The Conspiracy Project. Available on DVD, TCP pulls no punches, starting with the often-attacked idea of conspiracies themselves. Fox draws from a palette of images, news footage, music, and video effects, combining them with quotes by known opinion leaders (both good and bad) and Neals insightful and oft-times satirical lyrics that provoke one to think outside of the box. This is definitely required viewing for anyone with questions about our school system, world events, the banking industry, chemtrails, the Constitution, the Federal Reserve, mainstream media, and much more.

Besides being educational, TCP is highly entertaining, providing enough comic relief to keep one from going down the emotional rabbit hole. And the visual effects are stunning; truly the work of a master who knows the art and the craft of delivering a message that creates an emotional, intellectual and spiritual impact.

7554302,5,B018RCYLJ8,"This documentary is worth watching again and again for the aesthetics alone. I've never seen ""conspiracy theories"" presented in such a way before. I wouldn't be surprised if even the skeptics might think twice after watching. And I loved how Neal defined ""conspiracy theory"" right in the beginning. A conspiracy theory is just that, a theory. It is presented for consideration and it is up to the individual to be persuaded or not by the evidence until the theory is one day proved or disproved.",1450742400,2,495,4.8352941176470585
7554303,5,B018RCYLJ8,"There were 2 films released this year which have been worthy of their 1970's counterparts. We all know the 1st one and then there was this. This is ""The Wall"" of conspiracy theory films. Neal Fox is such a huge talent - his voice, his music, his lyrics - will all take you from crying to roaring with laughter as you journey through the film. And of course the message was not lost on me. Bravo Mr. Fox and thank you! It's been a great week!",1450483200,2,441,4.1395348837209305
7554304,4,B018RCYLJ8,"If you're interested in ""unapproved / conspiratorial"" thoughts, but you'd like a different delivery system, you're in luck. By mixing information and entertainment, Neal has created a provocative and unique experience. He doesn't claim that the ideas presented in this film are proven, rather he shows why they deserve further investigation.

Thanks for the contribution, Neal. You're a talented, caring, and committed person. We could definitely use more people like you.",1457913600,2,472,5.647887323943662

7554306,5,B018RCYLJ8,"Neal's film is intense. Without lecturing, by entertaining, Neal's film made me laugh, made me angry, and pulled back the curtain of media and government claptrap to offer a riveting view behind it all. His treatment of the subject matter was ""thought-provoking,"" but what an understatement that is.",1452384000,2,299,5.25

7554309,5,B018RCYLJ8,"Neal Fox is an artist, and has dedicated himself to the truth. This DVD tells the truth about our world today. Artfully done, with love and care, it communicates to us the need to change the world where honesty and honor are the highest values of society.

7554312,5,B018RCYLJ8,"I saw and listened to this five-star quality, multi-genre film by Neal Fox, which I call, I think rightfully so, a ""mockumentary.""  The tone set by the director follows in the truest tradition of French author Voltaire, who with his book of ironic humor, CANDIDE, helped change France's future for the better.  Sometimes the so-called leading figures of the day need to be needled and mocked to get any significant movement in a politically constipated environment -- God knows, America needs a change today!

But, also, like a good meal, The Conspiracy Project brings different items on a well-balanced entree plate served up to us by Fox, which greet both eye and palate; some entice and intrigue, some are tasty, others may upset and anger... yet, the end result, the effect, the payoff, will certainly move many viewers to act in concert and help America. Which, I think, is the whole point.

Kudos and accolades for this film are well-deserved.",1452297600,2,949,4.9125

8742753,5,B018RCYLJ8,"Mr. Fox:  Your film is a true ""Tour de Force"" in literally every conceivable way. It should be required viewing for anyone with a still functioning brain.

I always stand in awe of people who are so totally multi talented in every aspect of Film Making.  The great Orson Welles springs to mind with his CITIZEN KANE.
Your film sought to fill a gap, as you have remarked yourself, among the dozens of 9/11 films in that there is a large segment of the population that has never watched a single 9/11 Documentary, sadly accepting the Government 9/11 story.  You have succeeded beyond your wildest imagination.

The numerous  quotes of people like David Rockefeller and Bill Gates totally blew me away and came as a veritable shock to my brain.  It is almost difficult to believe these powerful individuals made such statements but I have no reason to believe these quotes are not accurate.  Rockefeller's quote thanking the world of Media for agreeing to assist his personal agenda/s for the past 30 years is truly heartbreaking.

This film should absolutely be viewed by every citizen in America.  Every single one.
That includes High School age, college students and of course every adult.

As the film so clearly reflects that you are an individual of gargantuan creative, artistic talent, intellectual ability and unique vision, perhaps you can develop a cutting edge plan to ensure that virtually every person in America and elsewhere in the world views this film.

I can state here that as an individual who ""saw through"" the lies of 9/11 from day one and has watched virtually all the films and documentaries dealing with 9/11 since that fatal day, your groundbreaking film occupies a place of its own.

Again, it is a veritable TOUR DE FORCE and approaches the level of directorial genius as did the immortal Orson Welles.  One can watch this film multiple times and never become tired of it as one never tires of listening to an Opera of Mozart or viewing a great Painting.

There may be other film makers who have produced laudatory 9/11 films but once again your film  is the missing link to bring in new generations of citizens who may have been slow and/or reluctant to accept the fact that they were conned by their own Government.

Just as Nations build up their Nuclear bomb arsenals, NOT to use them but rather to employ them as a deterrent to their enemies,  so too is it necessary, as the US Government builds up the capacity of its ""Police State"" to create a population of hundreds of millions of American citizens who will stand as a bulwark against any future Dictatorial government/s that may arise in the next several decades. It is imperative that ultra brilliant artistic individuals such as yourself continue to employ that brilliance to warn and protect people worldwide from the encroaching and very real threat of future Big Brother, Police States where the masses are reduced to Chip Implanted, mindless Slaves to be exploited by the upper Elite classes.

Your exceptional artistic Productions will stand the test of time Mr. Fox.

It is a privilege to know that we still have individuals of your caliber in our midst.
May the gods watch over and protect you and yours from all perpetrators of Evil.",1489190400,,3228,4.781981981981982

His political insights and satirical comedy, as well as his compositions and musical performances in The Conspiracy Project are compelling stuff that challenges your most closely held beliefs in the face of facts, statistics, and truth.
