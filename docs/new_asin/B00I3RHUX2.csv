6248435,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I purchased this set to watch a single episode -- ""The Good Luck Charm"" with guest star Gloria Swanson.  In particular, I wanted to see the performance of a young (then) actress named Jena Engstrom who played the dying young woman who considered the former movie star played by Gloria Swanson to be her good luck charm.  As expected, Jena Engstrom was great; she left acting in 1964 because of her health, not because of lack of talent.  As for the series and the episode, I was suprised that I liked them.  This series came out after I had enlisted in the Army and was overseas (Europe).  I don't recall ever watching it after I left the Army.  It has not been shown on TV much and I expected that I would find it to be like so many other shows of the 1960s -- a cringe-worthy view of how we saw ourselves back then.  It is better than than, and a lot of that is probably due to Richard Chamberlain who always has had a good screen presence.  As for the episode ""The Good Luck Charm,"" I liked it to.  I suspect that forever played versions of Norma Desmond after the 1950 film ""Sunset Boulevard.""  I think it is one of the great movie performances ever.  And Julia Colton is a version of Norma Desmond, but Norma Desmond was insane, Julia Colton is not.  She is  an actress whose greatness is behind her and the loss of attention has made her fragile and vulnerable while still presenting an over-the-top persona to her diminishing fan base.  The story of how an admiring dying woman makes this star of the past come to grips with reality is a good piece of story telling.",1394755200,5,1573,4.342465753424658
6248436,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I loved this series when first aired and it is so nice to have a really good set of DVDs of this series.  Rather expensive (in UK when you have to add Duty, handling and mailing costs) but still worth it",1394236800,2,203,3.951219512195122
6248437,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I am enjoying the second series of Dr. Kildare on DVD - good stories, wonderful acting from Richard Chamberlain and the great Raymond Massey, plus an array of guest stars. The stories and characters stand the test of time and I am enjoying this series more than almost anything currently being televised. Can't wait for season three to be released!",1394064000,2,348,4.816666666666666
6248438,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I was anticipating the release of Dr. Kildare: The Complete Second Season through Amazon.com, soon after Warner Archive made the announcement of their street date.  I was in for a real treat when it arrived in the post for my birthday.  Thank you so very much Warner Archive and Amazon.com.  The Complete First Season was sensational, and The Complete Second Season will not disappoint those who appreciate high quality dramatic storytelling from television's past.  Those who are into spotting the stars, and gathering snip-its of their work will l - o - v - e this.  I believe the season finale ""What's God to Julius"" to be a fan favourite!!!!!

P.S.  As of June 6th 2014, I have just learned Warner Archive announced the DVD availability of Dr. Kildare: The Complete Third Season.  I am ready to place my order through Amazon.com just as soon as it is listed.

6248439,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I'm the last person who would think I would like a soap opera type show, but I really like this show! Each episode I've seen has notable guest stars, and the story's have a lot of meaning. You also get many episodes to enjoy! They also say these are made on demand, so I always order them soon after release because it's been my experience that the initial batch is pressed. The picture quality is excellent even though there is no note of it being restored. Warner Brothers has been releasing on a regular basis, so hopefully we will get the whole set!",1392076800,7,553,4.378640776699029

6248442,5,B00I3RHUX2,I love these old doctor shows. This one is quite fun as it shows how far our medical equipment has come since the sixties. It doesn't always end happy but it's great drama and very wholesome.,1420934400,,191,4.333333333333333

6248447,5,B00I3RHUX2,"My wife is a big fan. Dr Kildare was her first love when she was 12 yo. What better memories than to buy her, her dream man (in film of course) even though our son is now older than the good doctor was when the 2nd season appeared on TV. Enjoy, it's all good!.",1411603200,4,260,3.8333333333333335
6248448,3,B00I3RHUX2,"There's nothing wrong with the content - the shows are great, just as they were in the original airing.  But for the price, I expected a little more in the way of packaging.  The covers are identical on both vol. 1 and vol. 2 - nice photo on the front, general info on the back; but there is NOTHING inside except DVD discs, each with the appropriate titles printed right on the disc.  That's it.  No extra booklet, no extra photos, no nothing.  The Marcus Welby seasons, in contrast, offer beautiful packaging and inserts with extra pictures as well as episode information.  If you want to know anything about a Kildare episode besides the title, you have to read the credits as they roll by.  I was happy to get this set, and would rate the actual discs a 5 - but the packaging is a huge disappointment and only rates a 1.  So, average rating: 3 stars.  And it should have been higher.  The set could have been so much more.",1408752000,,926,4.3313953488372094
6248449,2,B00I3RHUX2,"The story lines (except the one featuring John Larch receiving an overdose of radioactive Cobalt) were rather unremarkable.
As with most of the MOD dvds these refuse to play one day and the might play another day. The price of these MOD sets
are too expensive for the aggravation they cause.",1407628800,,291,4.7254901960784315

6248452,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I bought this 2nd season after watching and loving the 1st (which I remember watching on TV years ago) and it totally meets my expectations. So much superior to today's TV programming. The characters knew right from wrong and weren't afraid to take a stand. And the plots of these shows are actually about the patient and his/her ailments, not some crazy interpersonal activities among the doctors and nurses.",1401667200,2,409,4.942028985507246
6248453,5,B00I3RHUX2,Bought this for my wife - and she loves it. She's already asking if I know when Season 3 is coming out.,1401321600,,103,3.727272727272727
6248454,5,B00I3RHUX2,"I saw this television show as a small child and loved it.  I'm now sharing it with my daughter and she loves it also.  Really like the little bits of humor added here and there.  We find the mention of God and the Bible in different episodes so refreshing.  Shows now days wouldn't care to do that and for that reason, Dr. Kildare is extra special to us.",1399939200,2,354,4.161764705882353
6248455,5,B00I3RHUX2,"Doctor Kildare was actually before my time.  I was a kid so young, I never experienced Doctor Kildare when the show aired in prime time. I had always heard of Doctor Kildare in movies and I had a few and liked them. So when I saw this Doctor Kildare DVD set I had to give them a chance.  I am happy I brought Seasons One and Two of Doctor Kildare.  Like season one Dr Kildare is a young idealistic doctor being led by the sometimes kindly, always blunt fatherly advice of an elder doctor.

Doctor Kildare wants to be a world class diagnostitian. Dr Kildares failing he is a young idealist as such he is susceptible to all the flights of fancy that led young men away from the common sense virtues of their respective callings.  Doctor Kildare faces the death of his patients and the moral quagmires that come from their struggles.  Dr. Kildare is thust into confront various social ills like drug abuse, alcoholism and disfunctional families all cleaned up enough to pass 1950's sensibilities and network censorship.

It's awesome seeing all the old cars that were in this time brand new.  If you know anything at all about medicine its fun to watch them prescribe treatments that have been replaced or debunked as bad medicine.  It was at first funny to watch Dr. Kildare deal with a Smallpox patient when in 2014 the only living small pox viruses live in cold storage in assorted labs. I never saw what smallpox looked like. I was asstounded seeing what it looked like on one episode of Dr. Kildare. Also I did not know smallpox was so easily transmitted as it appears on the show.  Dr. Kildare gave me a new respect for smallpox that those who suffered with it.

What Dr. Kildare showed was state of the art medicine at the time it aired. Another thing that struck me is how dark, depressing and cavernous Blair General Hospital the hospital hallways, rooms and wards always looked. The so called Hospital Ward has been almost completely replaced by the semi-private room.  The hospital ward where the poorest patients were placed in one large cummunal bedroom sorted by race and gender of course is a thing of the past now. Todays hospitals are soaring edifices of glass, steel and concrete, metal and brick. Todays hospitals are bathed in light which is a 180 about face compared to the hospital Dr. Kildare calls home. Today's hospitals are filled with art work and exciting structure all designed to create an atmosphere of healing. Blair General Hospital was dungeon like in design, its rooms like prison wards. Also looking at Dr. Kildare and you see how far the profession of nursing has come in 2014.  In Dr Kildare's time nurses were not much more than maids with a little medical knowledge. Today's nurse is part administrator, social worker, healer and leiazon between patient and all others. Today there are medical assistants to do the scutt work that nurses performed in Doctor Kildares time.

Doctor Kildare is filled with stereotypes bums are always drunken sots laying in the gutter victim of bad choices rather than the lack of jobs or opportunity. Fallen ladies lacking wifely virtues are clearly indicated in an Doctor Kildare story. I find Dr. Kildare interesting on many different levels.  Dr. Kildare is interesting for the social commentary and insights it gives to the culture of the United States in the 1950's. This series is a sort of Norman Rockwells view of hospital life with clean cut All American Dr. Kildare fighting evil disease, rescuing the innocent and curing the sick at least till they died.  On Doctor Kildare they died boy did they die.  If you base your experiences on Dr. Kildare the body count was high in hospitals of the time but no where near the death rate at the hospital where Ben Casey hailed but thats another review.

Surfice to say that Dr. Kildare is interesting in many fronts even if its medical treatments which were cutting edge medicine in their day have most long ago lost relevence in 2014. I brought this Season Two and Season One of Dr Kildare and am happy I did. If you know what to expect going in Doctor Kildare never disappoints. Dr. Kildare is a look back at idealistic 1950's life as seem from the eyes of a young energetic doctor who wants to change thew world for the better!",1397779200,5,4251,4.660427807486631
6248456,5,B00I3RHUX2,"Super transfers and good story lines make this a must-have for fans of '60s TV! Color episode with Robert Redford is cool and shows glimpses of MGM's backlot recognizable from Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, Courtship Of Eddie's Father, etc! Look forward to season 3!",1397692800,3,264,5.0227272727272725
6248457,5,B00I3RHUX2,I have thoroughly enjoyed watching all episodes of Dr Kildare especially Richard Chamberlain. Life was so simple then as now.,1396137600,,125,5.3
6248458,5,B00I3RHUX2,"Breathtaking drama at its absolute finest, Dr. Kildare: Season 2 is a reminder of the glorious television programming of the era it portrays.  Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey are totally convincing as Dr. Kildare and Dr. Gillespie.  The plots provide intriguing, engaging, and heartwarming stories of human tragedy and triumph.  You become so involved watching the episodes that it's best to put everything else on hold.....you won't want to miss a scene or a moment of Dr. Kildare as the young intern dedicates himself to the noble career of medicine.  I certainly hope that season 3 will be available as soon as possible.",1395878400,,630,5.087378640776699
6248459,1,B00I3RHUX2,"The mfgrs suggested retail price for these is $49.95...  While I love the series, I'm not biting until the price is right!  Why do I pay for a Prime membership - for the privelege of being gouged???  Hold off until the price drops, or try e-bay and other sources (although I'm sure Amazon will try their best to make this difficult as possible through their anti-competitive and ""price-fixing"" policies...  I intend to bring these to the attention of my State Attorney General, Dep't of Consumer Affairs, and the U.S. Atty General's office!
Shame on you, Amazon!

****Update June 26, 2014: Fair is fair - Now that Amazon has repriced this set, I've added stars to my review. While those who ordered this set earlier did indeed pay too much (and I'm STILL not impressed with Amazon's policies and behavior), I must say the content and quality of this is now well worth the price with free shipping!  Excellent series, very good video quality and no noticeable changes to theme/accent music from original broadcast.

UPDATE: Glad to see the price at a more reasonable level now...  Unfortunately, a new problem has reared it's ugly head.  Disk 7 appears to be defective.  After trying multiple dvd players as well as a new external dvd r/w drive on my pc (all of which perform fine with other dvds) episode 27 is showing ""unrecoverable errors"", which generally means a ""bad pressing"" at time of production.  This was discovered the day I opened part2 package - fresh out of the box.  Close examination of the disk with a jeweler's loupe reveals no scratches or dirt whatsoever.  Hopefully you won't have this problem (it's possible that later pressings are intact)...  Off come some stars again!

***Update Jan. 10, 2015 - Stay away from Warner Home Video DVDs! I have since bought Season 3 part one and am once again finding unreadable episodes (S3 D2 second episode) Read my review of season 3 for details, this is not due to mishandling on my part or scratches, and the problems are repeatable on 2 different dvd players and a brand new dvd drive - POOR QUALITY CONTROL!",1394755200,4,2071,4.729805013927576
