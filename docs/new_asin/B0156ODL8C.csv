7429224,5,B0156ODL8C,This was a gift. I have heard no complaints so assume it is good,1453852800,,64,3.642857142857143
7429225,1,B0156ODL8C,"This DVD has exactly ONE episode of Death Valley Days.  ONE episode, for $10??  You have to be kidding me.  What a waste of money.",1444608000,3,130,4.12
7429226,5,B0156ODL8C,"I loved the fact that the show was not edited to improve it's quality. You get a real sense of the era of TV  by some of the grainy footage and how it seems to halt on some shots.
The two I have seen so far would have never been made in today's over sensitive politically correct world - example a lady teacher having a gun in her purse at school and discharging it in class to get the out of control disruptive students in line. You get a real sense of how life was in that time.
Wish the episodes would have been separated into individual selections instead of being recorded as one continuous show. There is no way to jump from episode to episode have to fast forward through show to get to another episode.
Be aware that this DVD is not of any HD or cable TV quality.
If the content of the show is more important to you the high quality I highly recommend purchasing it.
I never heard of the show until a fellow I work with was telling me about it so I can not speak for whether all the episodes are there or who is starring in them.
He told me Ronald Regan stared in it but haven't seem him in the 2 episodes I have seen.",1437782400,7,1126,4.026785714285714
7429227,1,B0156ODL8C,"Not happy with this product. Audio and video is fair at best, only 3 episodes is very disappointing  and they are not separated on the DVD.",1434240000,15,139,4.346153846153846
7429228,5,B0156ODL8C,hard to find stories not often found on dvd,1431129600,,43,3.888888888888889
7429229,2,B0156ODL8C,There were only three 30 minute episodes on this disk and it was considerably overpriced for its limited selection and poor video and audio quality.  Although the cover was attractive I doubt that this rip off was professionally produced.  Buyer beware.,1431129600,19,253,5.146341463414634

8732823,1,B0156ODL8C,This issue of Death Valley Days is a disgrace! How this Desert Island Classics was allowed to release this DVD is beyond me. The picture quality of the few episodes shown is terrible. Please do not waste your money on this DVD. Utter rubbish! Desert Island Classics are a joke!!!,1488672000,2,279,4.6
