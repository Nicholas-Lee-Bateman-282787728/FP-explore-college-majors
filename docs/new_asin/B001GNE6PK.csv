8306290,4,B001GNE6PK,"Gaston and his inept sidekick come upon a decomposed corpse of a man killed by an arrow to the back. The movie moves quickly from there a bald Indian shoots and kills the horse of a young girl and tries to kidnap her but Gaston shows up. Ghostly indians, bad, bad, guys and venom tipped arrows. Good plot, fairly well made mexican movie from Mexico's golden era. Worth every penny. I met Gaston in the early sixties at one of his bullfights in Mexico.",1441152000,,451,4.380952380952381
8306291,4,B001GNE6PK,"Ok late 50's Spanish-language, Mexican-made south-of-the-border western.  A young woman is menaced by scurvy bad guys who want to appropriate her ranch.  She is aided by a young, mask-less Lone Ranger type with a white horse and a comic sidekick.  The bad guys are so stinko they even enter her property whenever it suits them and make themselves at home.  Rotten, aren't they?  They also have a Native Mexican lurking on the sidelines to take out anyone that suits his fancy with a bow and arrow.  He even plans to make the girl his unwedded misses.  Not bad western that moves right along.  The DVD is Ok quality but I recently saw this film on a Spanish-language movie channel and the picture and color were excellent so I know there is a superb master out in the word somewhere.  Hopefully that one will be released very soon.  Recommended for western fans.",1409961600,,861,4.642384105960265
