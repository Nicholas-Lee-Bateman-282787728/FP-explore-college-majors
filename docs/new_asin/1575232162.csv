7798773,5,1575232162,"A rather well done, presented, and researched effort of the great Battle of Leyte Gulf, by U.S. News and World Report.  This is a fairly short documentary at only 45 minutes, and so with reduced, however achieved aims.  It is interestingly biographical in focus.  And therefore when the Battle commentary is engaged, highly descriptive explanations are given up, in favor of the psychological elements.  Nonetheless, even though strict military coverage of the Sea Battle is reduced, what is given in generally accurate, understandable, and incisive.  U.S. News and World Report thankfully gives the viewer a non-derivative description of the Battle, which during the turn of the century (2000) one could unfortunately find as well.  This was not one of the latter...  Some light is naturally shed on Japanese and American higher planning, and organization.  My only complaint is that it could have been longer, and somewhat more in depth.  Albeit, for what was planned, that is, given their aims, it was an excellent job.  Highly recommended.",1340323200,,1043,5.228915662650603

7798775,2,1575232162,"I'm a 22 year U.S. Army veteran and served in the Gulf War (Desert Shield/Storm).  I was looking for a good well rounded documentary about the events that had influenced my life in 1990/1991.  This was not it.
It's an eight disc set, but five of the discs are just about worthless.  They are mostly about weapons systems (at test and firing ranges), some not even used in Desert Storm. They are more a like a defense contractors introductory film for a new product some nations armed forces had just acquired. There is even footage from a big arms fair years after Desert Storm.  The lame background music, and sound quality on all the discs reminded me of army training films from the 80's.  Crisp and clear video is one of the few good points.
Two of the discs I did like. So, it's not all entirely bad.  One disc had a good account of the 100 hour ground war with decent footage, and a very detailed account with good film footage on the 36 hour battle for Kahfji, which occured in late January 1991.  The other disc was devoted to the air war and had good but over used stock footage.  The third disc was just basically the two (ground and air) combined and condensed.
The story is told entirely from a coalition point of view.  It never goes into the reasons for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, or the political manuevering prior to January 17, 1991 to get Saddam to leave peacefully. The war footage narration has an overly heavy ""RAH!!, RAH!!!, Hooray for ourside!!!"" tone to it.
Unless you are a military hardware buff leave this alone.
As a Gulf War veteran I was pretty much dissatisfied.",1218585600,2,1593,4.484429065743945
7798776,1,1575232162,"Don't think that you are buying a historical account of the Gulf War. This is nothing like BattleLine or the World at War.
This set comprises stock footage, and combined with cheezy music, it makes for awful viewing.
If you want to see things go ""bang"", well it might be your cup of tea.
There is almost NO footage of the war, no interviews, no strategy...it should not be called War in the Gulf!
It should be called ""Look at the big weapons America has"".",1215475200,3,455,4.364705882352941
7798777,2,1575232162,"Beautifully packaged but indifferent as historical documentary, this 8 disk collection is mostly footage of sexy aircraft taking off from or landing on carriers, and aging Iraqi tanks burning after missile hits; each repetitiously replayed from one disk to the next beneath an overlay of upbeat music usually reserved for corporate training films and porn movies.

A map here and there give broad overall feel for strategy in a war which the producers did not see fit to show reasons for fighting -- but the selection of material for this set demonstrate an interest less with the Gulf War as an historical moment, and more with amaze-your-friends tricks of 1990s military weaponry. Despite its title, much of the collection isn't even about the Gulf War.

As an example, one disk in the set spends much of its time inexplicably describing South African armored cars used against Angola. Another disk is devoted, almost in its entirety, to developments in Russian armored vehicles four years after the end of the Gulf War at what appears to be a 1995 trade show for international arms merchants. A third disk is a fast paced collection of clips of US military inventory of the late 90s, almost ten years after the Gulf War.
This is much like selling an 8 disk DVD set entitled ""World War II"", and using 1/3 of the material to document ordinance introduced during the Korean War.

Given the lack of historical facts, the emphasis on exploding bunkers (one of which I saw repeated nine times before I stopped counting), and the misplaced timeframe of so much of the material, this set compares less to say, ""Vietnam A Television History"" or Ken Burns' ""Civil War"", and more to promotional footage for an inaccurate historical PC game intended for teenagers enraptured by high tech toys played out on a battlefield.
Come to it, even the game manufactures wouldn't have made so many historical mistakes -- they tend to value good research.

Articles on the subject of the Gulf War from Wikipedia and Encarta are far more informative.",1139529600,7,2029,4.872463768115942
