7836411,2,6303029329,"Is it me, or is it unclear how the title of this 1994 ghost story-caper film, COLD SWEAT, relates to the tale it tells?  I have James Brown's ""Cold Sweat,"" which is not heard in the film, playing in my head but a Chris Rea tune, ""Too Much Pride,"" is the movie's theme song.

I see several reviews mistake this movie for a 1970 Charles Bronson picture of the same name.

And before you get even more mixed up, Adam Baldwin, one of the actors in COLD SWEAT, is not one of the acting Baldwin brothers clan.

But I am not in a position to clear up this confusion: The description of COLD SWEAT says it's about a hit man haunted by the spirit of a woman he had to kill because she witnessed a murder he was paid to commit.  But the film pays more attention to albeit unwitting romantic rivals and a coincidental hit one puts out on the other for financial reasons, which brings the gun for hire into their world.  The wrap-up to the hit man/ghost part of the story ends with a whimper, not a bang.  However, you may not care about that disappointing conclusion because, anchored by the offbeat performances of Shannon Tweed and Dave Thomas, the characters chasing love and money hold your attention and you'll want to see how all that business wraps up.  The disregard for human life some of those individuals demonstrate might appall you if not for the quirky way Tweed, Thomas, and the others play it.

As I write this in November 2012, COLD SWEAT is available for purchase only in V.H.S. format.  I happened to see it on a streaming service, where it's better dollar value.",1353888000,,1571,4.404844290657439
