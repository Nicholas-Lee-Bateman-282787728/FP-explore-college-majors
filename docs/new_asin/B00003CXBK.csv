It is very creative and very fun to watch.  I normally hate  annamated movies but this was truly an amazing movie.  If you like animals,  war, love stories(not to much, but just enough), curses, creativity...then  you'll love this movie I guarntee it!",950400000,4,408,4.36
1315315,5,B00003CXBK,"This is probably one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I finally got a chance to see the English version tonight, and was blown away. It had, by far, the BEST animation that I have ever seen in a  Japanese film. The English dubbing was near PERFECT, and the voices were  VERY suiting for the characters. Claire Danes (San) and Gillian Anderson  (Moro) were by far the best, but the rest were all fitting too. The plot  itself was excellent, and I was not bored once. I sure hope that more  movies like Mononoke get translated into English with this amount of  quality.",950313600,,581,4.433962264150943

The story is complex and entertaining.  The English dub isn't bad, in fact, compared to most Anime, its quite good.  However I'm still really hope that the DVD release has a subtitled version  as well as the dubbed version, and that they keep it in widescreen (most  DVDs are pretty good about that).  Anyway, thats about it...if you get a  chance to see this movie...don't pass it up.  You won't be disapointed!",950227200,,590,4.321100917431193

This is a spectacular view of ancient Japanese legends rolled up into a story about a boy who meets a wolf raised girl and how they must save both humans and the forest they both love.

1316297,5,B00003CXBK,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. I've seen this on the big screen, both dubbed and subtitled.
While it can be argued that you get much more from subtitles, such as the actors voice inflection. This is an argument for live action films. With animated films, the person you see on the screen is not the person who uttered the words. They are a drawing!
So it's not the same as when you watch Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon and they have dubbed some silly voice over Toshiro Mifune's unmistakable grunt.
However.
This thing that the US distributors of Ghibli films are doing is criminal. They are somehow seeking to add to the sales of Ghibli films by injecting star power in the voice talent. So we have Clair Danes, Gillian Anderson, Billy Bob Thornton and other such folks with VERY recognizable names given front cover billing on the case. As if they were a part of the original Japanese production.

(I have to point out here that the specs listed for this movie are a lie. It is not an English language film with Japanese dubbing. It's the other way around. Visit IMDB to confirm!)

What is worse, actors like Billy Bob Thornton are not accustomed to doing this type of voice over work. The budget for the English Language dub is not ever very big (they had to spend plenty to get that star power in the first place). So we are treated to dubbing with some timing problems and less than ideal delivery.
Please, Disney, quit subjecting the Ghibli studio's stuff to such treatment. You are ruining the movies for people who have never seen them before.
That all said, this movie has some of the most vivid, beautiful scenes I've ever seen in an animated movie.  Just for the sheer spectacle of Hayao Miyazaki's genius it is worth the small amount they charge. And the story, it is quite poignant. If you still have a dry eye all the way through the movie, please see a psychotherapist. You are probably an psychopath, and may harm yourself or others if you do not seek help.
This movie, while violent is no more so than Lego Ninjago or much of what kids watch these days. It is however a movie you may end up discussing with your children quite a bit. Like almost all Miyazaki films, it has a morality and a deep humanity to it. There are not clear sides of evil and good. And this is intentional. So if you are worried about kids under 10 watching this, it should be because you do not want to discuss the existence of good and evil in the world, and humanities role in this. Not because of a few scenes with 'cartoon violence'.",1516320000,,2533,4.431330472103005

1316398,3,B00003CXBK,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere. But although I've grown up with many of his films, there ARE still a few I have yet to see for various reasons. And I'm embarrassed to say this was one of them. For how famous this film is, it's only now that I'm finally watching it. And though the journey I was taken on was nothing short of breathtaking, it's not without its problems.

In ancient Japan, a young warrior prince named Ashitaka is inflicted with a deadly curse while fighting off a demon attacking his village.  Forced to leave his home, he heads west in search of the Great Forest Spirit, who he hopes can cure him. There, he stumbles into a bitter conflict between Lady Eboshi, who has been systematically destroying the forest and killing its magical creatures to build her town, and the enigmatic Princess Mononoke, a young girl raised by wolves, who will stop at nothing to prevent the humans from destroying her home, and the forest spirits and animal gods who live there. Now caught in the middle of this fight, Ashitaka must find a peaceful solution to the conflict, or else his curse will slowly consume and kill him.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and the various magical creatures are imaginative and unlike anything you've ever seen before in a fairy tale. Even stronger is its environmental messages, and the conflict between humankind's growth and development and nature's need for preservation. Neither side of the issue is completely in the right or wrong, and both the humans, animals, and nature gods are all fighting for their fair share of the world---that good and evil and violence and peace exist in all of us, and it's all about finding a balance.

My main problem, however, lies in the characters. Arguably, the best, most interesting character in the film is Lady Eboshi--the leader of Irontown who is tough, but fair to her people, and is the perfect example of a ""likeable villain"". Her village is a refuge for social outcasts, including former brothel workers and lepers, whom Eboshi employs to manufacture firearms to defend against the gods. As such, she's well respected by her people, making her not so much evil as just extremely misguided, due to her attempts to destroy the magical creatures that upset her town's progress at every turn.

The other two protagonists, on the other hand, don't fare as well by comparison. Ashitaka's demon curse helps make him realize that hate and killing isn't the answer to solving the conflict between man and nature, but...it doesn't seem to really hinder him all that much. I was completely expecting him to turn into a full on monster at some point, but instead, he just has one or two close calls and that's about it. Honestly, there were a few times I actually forgot he was even infected with a curse at all. But my biggest sticking point is Mononoke herself (or San as she's actually called). It's weird that the movie is named after her, when she's actually not in it all that much and doesn't really do too much in the grand scheme of the film. You'd think with her being a human raised by wolves that SHE would be the perfect choice of main character to have to be the one to unite humans and nature, but....nope. She just spends the majority of the time complaining about the evils of humanity while Ashitaka gets most of the screen time.

While I AM glad I finally saw this, it's definitely not my most favorite of Miyazaki's work. If you want to watch a Studio Ghibli film with a more emotional and likeable main character, and an environmental message that's executed a bit simpler, then go watch ""Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind.""",1512345600,,4007,4.692745376955903

1316707,5,B00003CXBK,"When viewing the most spectacular animated feature in film history, one's mind is inevitably drawn to Tolkien. There are several common thematic threads, but it's the immense detail and history that conjures up thoughts of Middle Earth lore. Miyazaki's world is so rich and lovingly crafted that it becomes authentic. A sense of wonder is prevalent throughout, propelled by characters with a considerable amount more depth than your prototypical cartoon heroes and villians. Not everything is black and white, and that's what differentiates it from the rest of the wolf pack.",1496188800,,575,5.329670329670329

1316761,4,B00003CXBK,"I saw this movie in a theatre in Curitiba, Brazil, in May, 2017.

It reminded me of Avatar, only better.  No howling teradactyls in this movie, instead lots of forest spirits and animals, beautiful Japanese landscapes and mass confusion as everyone seems to be fighting everyone.

There are so many warlords, feudal villages, samurai and peasants and royalty fighting each other in this film it makes one wonder if this really were the case in Japan when this story (myth) took place.  But the story line basically goes like this.  Dashing young man kills demon, but not before demon infects him with a curse.  Young man is to die.  Young man goes into battle but has a hard time deciding if he should fight the humans or help them, in their quest to conquer the spirits of the forest.  In the end, young man gets the girl, and all the forest spirits are placated.  The end.

P.S.  Avatar, that movie that raises the issues of modernity and progress versus nature and forest came after this movie, if I am correct in reading dates.  Thus, this theme is one that has been bandied around for quite a few years.",1494028800,,1108,4.540404040404041
1316762,5,B00003CXBK,"Bottom Line First: To get the less than good news out of the way, Miyazakis Princes Mononoke is not for the very young. The violence can be graphic and bloody. The themes are not as clear cut as might be found in bed time stories. There is no sex or bad language making this movies acceptable to those who screen for such. And that brings me to the good news. Princes Mononoke combines complex storytelling, adult level plotting, the fine art work of Studio  Ghibli and the casting power of the Disney Studios to produce a wonderful movie. Highly recommended and a star even among my other Miyazaki movies.

Princes Mononoke could have been another man versus nature and the world out of balance movie we have seen too many times. Instead we have man and nature in conflict but with a near absence of obviously evil industrialists and purely motivated united forest spirits.  Gods can become demons, and seen as evil by humans and nature. The tribes within the world of nature are not natural allies and can have their own selfish motives. The human who is supposed to embody evil, Lady Eboshi (Voice acted by Minnie Driver) is a fierce warrior and hard nosed business woman but she is also good to her people and makes a point of finding better lives for people who would be cast offs and shunned in the larger world.

On the subject of voice overs, Disney deserves credit having assembled a cast that included Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes and Billy Crudup. Made too clear to us in the included specials is the extra effort made by the voice actors and Disney to insure that the American dialogue fits with the animated Japanese speaking characters.

As for the work of the director and his studio. What struck me most about Princes Mononoke was the balance between artistic detail and the flow of the story. Hayao Muyazaki has a tendency for story lines that can drag. I prefer to say they speed of motion can be stately.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-Rises/dp/B00MHT49TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind Rises</a>&nbsp;remains among my favorite HM movies, but like The Wife says it is slow. Even the action movie<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lupin-the-Third-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00PEA6LJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;can drag, usually when the Studio is highlighting it's artwork. In Princess there was no lag in the story line. Scene action and plot development move logically forward even in the moments when the viewer is invited to enjoy the scenery.

But what artwork it is! Studio Ghibli is always at its best drawing the sky and aerial views. Ghibli is also the master of fields and forests. Sometimes at the cost of foregrounds, manmade and human details. In Princess all of the elements view together in harmony. It may be that some level of detail has been lost, but if so, only to produce a more balanced picture. Studio Ghibli movies can be fine visual art at the expense of movement, I never felt that watching Princess Mononoke.",1494028800,12,3164,5.230769230769231

Review stated by: Grant Elmore , A.K.A.  Simply Overcomplicated Reviews

Are you for or against big businesses? Do you care deeply or none whatsoever about global warming? This will are change upon viewing Princess Mononoke. This movie takes a whole new view at these problems in the most unexpected way.

Set in ancient Japan, this film follows Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) journeying through a war zone of a land to find the source of his curse. His journey is quickly halted upon finding two unconscious men in a river. He finds himself in the middle of a all not war between man and animal. He plays mediator between man and beast and finds himself in love. This love leads him into lots of turmoil. Follow one young mans quest as He hopes to find a cure to a illness he is told is incurable, as he faces many obstacles even the inevitable rejection by his loves mother.

Billy Crudup voices our protagonist (Ashitaka) in this English dubbed version of the Studio Ghibli Film.
He does a great job ,and I cant imagine the struggle of voicing this dub of which he does as best he possibly can. San is voiced by Claire Danes does a fantastic job in each subtle pronunciation of her lines. Though she says few lines, she does so in the most eloquent way. Each performance was done well ,even the background voices did a great job. I suppose the character I felt did a significantly poorer job would be Gonza(John DiMaggio). He seemed to be there simply for the punchline of anyone arounds joke. He seemed to be tropey. In a town full of women ,He plays the stupid guy.
Its quite disappointing since he is the general of their army.

I enjoyed the film scores. Even in the most disturbing of scenes you had the most beautiful scores. In the scene opening the movie, You see a demon possessing a boar. Even though the images are quite disturbing, the score is such a whimsical experience. One thing I found off putting is at some points in this movie the art style/pacing changed in an awkward manner. There is a scene in which it shows the hill in front of Ashitaka moving and I didn't feel it fit well.

This movie truly shows why you shouldnt just watch as forests are torn down. Sure there may not be giant boars and wolves to stop you ,but one day your forest will be a mountain. You need to protect the land you're given and not kill the only things you have.

This movie is PG-13 and rightfully so.  It would be appropriate for 10+ year olds I believe. The movie is not any more graphic than that of Marvel. There are particular scenes in which arms are completely cut off characters, but it is done so in a cartoonish manner. Some scenes as previously stated include some mild ,somewhat scary content including a parasitic demon possession.

1317200,5,B00003CXBK,"I was given this vhs as a gift from my parents quite a long time ago. The DVD version was in sale at the time, but we didn't own a DVD player yet. While the only downfall of having this awesome movie in VHS means I didn't get to enjoy seeing it in Japanese, I will take off my hat to the amazing english dub.

Usually in my experience english dubs of anime are either ill cast (who chooses a Britsh granny to play Luna in Sailor Moon when Luna's human form has the body of an 18 year old?), filled with corny lines (Yu-Gi-Oh! comes to mind), or just a bad case of overacting. Luckily, Princess Mononoke despite the age of the dub is one of the best I have ever heard.

If there is one thing that makes me feel sad about this vhs edition, it will be from the super brief censorship at the scene where someone shoots Moro's chest. Since the vhs was the first edition of the film I saw, I always thought it was super weird that someone as meticulous as Hayao would purposely have a scene that seemed to jump off for a brief second. It wasn't until I bought the mexican spanish dub edition of the dvd that was uncut where I realized the USA VHS dub cut off brief instances of the footage. Weird given there are other violent scenes in the film that were left intact.

Otherwise the Princess Mononoke will always be my favorite Miyazaki film and I will forever ponder why it wasn't in the running for an Oscar (I will be fair, the category for best animated feature for the Oscars started in 2001). However, We can all agree that The Princess Mononoke in every way was a superior film to The Full Monty that despite all of the hype that the movie is the ultimate Ordinary Joe turn Chippendale is otherwise a borefest.

I would have preferred one of the outstanding sounds from the soundtrack of this film to have competed to the Oscar over the silly song they chose from Con Air. :S",1482537600,,1877,4.23463687150838

The protagonist Ashitaka must leave his home when he is cursed by a demon and travel to ask the Forest Spirit to save him. Along the way he makes many friends and enemies including Lady Eboshi and San, who both want each other dead. San is an incredible female protagonist who has to figure out who she is because even though she was raised by wolves ad hates humans, she undoubtedly not a wolf. Eboshi is a tough, relenting, feministic woman and her drive to be the best is what keeps her interesting. Ashitaka believes the best of people and this is an attribute that I find amusing. All of Hayao's characters have depth along with the storyline and I hope to achieve that someday and it's the inspiration that keeps me developing my characters and trying to keep my plot interesting enough to readers.",1480377600,,935,4.5058823529411764

1317311,5,B00003CXBK,"I absolutely love the works of Hayao Miyazaki, as well as the output of his studio, Studio Ghibli.  His work is masterful, creative, and full of wonderful animation and artwork, and the stories are always exciting and full of meaning.  I shied away from ""Princess Mononoke"" for a long time, however, as I'd heard it was among his most violent films.  Not that violence in a story will necessarily turn me off, but I'm not a fan of excessive blood and gore, and this film is pretty infamous among animation fans.  In the end, however, I opted to give it a chance... and I'm so glad I did.  This is most certainly NOT a kid's film, but I'd daresay it's among Miyazaki's best.

NOTE:  I watched the English dub of this film, not the Japanese with subtitles.  Thus, I can't comment on the subtitles or the Japanese audio track.  This review is for the English-language version only.

""Princess Mononoke"" takes place in the Muromachi era of Japan, where samurai raid peasant villages for food and spirits of the forest still walk the Earth.  In a secluded village where the last of the Emichi tribe lives, a vengeful demon attacks, and burns the arm of a boy named Ashitaka before he can slay it.  The burn turns out to be a corruption that gives him superhuman strength... but will eventually kill him unless he can seek out a cure.  Ashitaka leaves his village, accompanied only by his faithful elk, and sets off to find said cure.  His journey will take him to Irontown, a mining village ruled by the coldly logical Lady Eboshi and that's under threat by both samurai and the angry gods and spirits of the forest, who are enraged that Eboshi has clear-cut and strip-mined their forests to build her town.  With the reluctant aid of San, a girl raised by the forest's wolf god, Ashitaka hopes to end the fighting and bring peace to both Irontown and the forest... but when Lady Eboshi and a smirking mercenary team up to slaughter the great Forest Spirit, will their greed and ruthlessness destroy both worlds?

As always for a Miyazaki movie, the animation is absolutely sumptuous.  In a day and age where 3D animation has taken over, one learns to appreciate the artistry and style of 2D animation, and here Miyazaki proves that hand-drawn art can be just as masterful as CGI.  The character designs, especially for the various forest denizens, are unique and eye-catching, and the scenery is just gorgeous.  And though not everything animated in this film is beautiful (there's gore and some rather ugly scenes of destruction and eldritch-looking creatures), it's certainly stunning and memorable.

Some have criticized the story of this film for being too ""green"" or ""tree-hugging,"" but I found it was handled a lot better than most environmentally-messaged movies tend to be (such as ""Ferngully"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"").  The film makes it clear that neither side of the conflict is wholly good or wholly evil, and that both sides waste energy fighting each other.  This film isn't about saving nature to the detriment of mankind, nor about benefiting mankind to the detriment of nature, but rather finding a balance between both sides.  And at its heart, under the ""Green Aesop,"" is still a fine adventure story about a boy on an epic quest, and through grit and determination manages to save the world.

Of all the characters in this film, I find that the most interesting one, curiously enough, is the villain.  Yes, Ashitaka and San are the main characters, and they're plucky enough, but they lack a lot of the charm that previous protagonists of Miyazaki's movies had (such as Kiki, Chihiro from ""Spirited Away,"" Patsu and Sheeta from ""Castle in the Sky,"" etc.).  And the forest gods and spirits, while they look fascinating enough, are fairly one-dimensional.  But Lady Eboshi is one of those rare villains that isn't evil for evil's sake, and is actually a complex character in her own right.  Her aims may be destructive, but it's obvious that she wants what's best for the people under command.  And she even has a compassionate side, giving jobs to outcasts such as lepers and former prostitutes.  Thank you, screenwriters, for not succumbing to the temptation to make her just another ""for the evulz"" villain.

As for the infamous blood and gore... yes, fight scenes tend to get bloody, and we even see decapitations and limbs be cut/bitten off.  And the scene where we slowly watch a forest god bleed out and turn into a demon is horrifying.  I would not recommend this movie for kids.  But for teenagers and adults, it's a rewarding watch all the same, and the gruesome scenes don't dominate the film.

Definitely for older audiences, ""Princess Mononoke"" is still a worthwhile watch.  It has a powerful message that doesn't beat the viewer over the head, beautiful visuals, and an exciting story, and it makes a fine addition to anyone's film collection.  A must-see for older Miyazaki fans.",1476835200,,4912,4.790973871733967

Most people I know enjoy ether My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's delivery sevice, or Spirited away, and while I still think those movies are good, I think Miyazaki shines at his epics. Storys of far off places and magical/mystical elements. My favorites by him are Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, and Howls Moving Castle. This movie is another masterpiece by him in terms of art, story, and characters. my only nitpick is that the english voice cast does not sound as good as some of his other ones like Castle in the Sky, or Nausica Valley of the wind. Overall though this is an amazing movie and you owe it to your self to go and watch it.

There is some gore, so if you are squeamish or overprotective with your kids, you may want to pass. I'd wait until my kids were at least 7 or 8 before popping this one in for them to watch.",1474329600,2,472,4.186813186813187

1317465,5,B00003CXBK,"This was the first Studio Ghibli movie I ever saw as well as one of the first DVDs I had way back in the year 2000.  If I ever saw a Studio Ghibli before this one I don't remember it.  It's possible I saw Kiki's Delivery Service first but I don't remember.  What I do remember was seeing this at a Best Buy and getting it.

Ashitaka, a prince from a remote village, has been cursed after killing off a rampaging demon.  Ashitaka must leave to find a possible cure.  He travels west to discover Iron Town where the demon came from.

What I like about this movie is that there's not really a villain. Lady Eboshi, the mistress of Iron Town, might seen a villain at first glance but she's protecting her own people from samurai and the Animal Gods that seek to get rid of those pesky humans.

Yes this is a environmental movie but it doesn't talk down to anyone.  It doesn't say that humans are pure evil...  and nature isn't exactly portrayed as pure good either.  Everybody is....human....for lack of a better word; it's about  shades of grey issues then about pitch black or pitch white.  If anything nature is portrayed as ""I am mighty and you can't kill me easily""

For being called Princess Mononoke, the namesake of the movie isn't in it that much.....nor is she a very deep character.  She seems to hate all humans because she was abandoned by her parents.....which is fine.  If my parents abandoned me to wolves I'd take a pretty dim view of humans.

The animation is gorgeous. It's a pity we've given up on traditionally animated movies here in the States......especially when we created the medium in the first place.

This movie started my love of other Studio Ghibli movies.",1471305600,,1684,4.5016501650165015

1317639,5,B00003CXBK,I love this movie although I hope it is noted that it is not for kids. There is blood and violence so whoever watches it should be ok with that. Nothing sexual in the violence; this is a fairy tale or a mythology. Typical Miyazaki in animation and interest of storyline. Some of it is stunningly beautiful.,1466380800,,306,4.385964912280702

They were slightly larger than your typical closed captioning, but they really were not distracting. The quality was even better than I thought. I hadn't seen Princess Mononoke before, but the cover made me guess that it would be more grainy than it turned out to be. I've been going through the Miyazaki films lately and Princess Mononoke is a definite must add to your collection. In my opinion it is Pre-Teen and up friendly because of the mild violence. However, it is not a gruesome film. The plot is set in ancient mythological Japan, and it's overarching theme is over how humans clashing is damaging the environment. It's visually stunning, and moved me emotionally. The story had a beautiful arch with great character development.  The Amazon Prices is around the same or lower than anywhere else you could get a new copy.",1463011200,,1006,4.68361581920904

In fact, I do not have to reach very far when I say this movie is a ""must watch"". To put it in perspective, IMDB ranks all movies, from all times in a top 100 format. Princess Mononoke is ranked in the mid 30's, in front of movies like Forrest Gump and The African Queen.

 Do not let the fact that this is an animated movie, in any way fool or distract you from watching it. I am not a huge fan of Anime in general, this is not some ""feely feels good"" anime movie with Pokemon characters talking about friendship and love. This movie would be a serious reach for younger children under 13 to grapple with and not have nightmares. It is not a movie made for kids yet most people would probably deem it suitable for their children to watch. The animation, creative direction, the mood set by the audio in this movie all of these factors are second only to the storyline. An incredibly deep, dark and foreboding storyline, one that will register a wide range of emotions during it.

 The short breakdown is that of a young man whom is one of the only remaining members of his bloodline. He lives in a small village with the rest of the remaining members of his clan. Early in the movie a beast which was once a regular hog, but is now a forrest demon after being tainted by iron shot from a musket. This beast attacks the boys town and he is injured while attempting to slay the beast. Soon after the protagonist learns of his eventual fate from the wound he received from the demon. The wound which is tainted will eventually tear his soul apart, before destroying his body and mind as well. He is exiled from his village and told that his only hope lies in finding the forest spirits and asking for a way to heal his wounds. What ensues is an epic(2+ hour) storyline, one that introduces a wide array of unique characters, ones that you will not forget.

Oh and BTW, despite being made by the Nippon based Studio Ghibli, the flawless voice acting is delivered by Billy Bob Thorton and Mimi Driver, among many other big time American voices.",1456272000,3,2177,4.352216748768473

1317935,5,B00003CXBK,"This is an extraordinary achievement, the work of not only a master animator but a master director. It is probably the greatest environmental film. No other film comes close, with the depth of vision and remarkable execution of a war between man and beast, industry and nature, and the journey of one person who seeks to reconcile both sides. It is a spiritual and cathartic experience that remains relevant in the world we live in today. Never does it get didactic; the film challenges the viewer to consider all perspectives and to see from a much deeper place than good vs. evil, a hugely admirable choice on the part of its director.

I am astonished every time I watch for so many reasons. It's so moving, how the main character Ashitaka is tainted by the boar demon, a figure unlike any depicted in animation, and must leave his secluded village. As he does, he witnesses Japan modernize from a traditional society before his eyes. The storytelling is terrific, as we'd expect from Hayao Miyazaki. But here his action sequences and characterization are at their most impressive. So many incredible characters and creatures, from the elusive warrior-leader Lady Eboshi of Iron Town to her foil, part-human part-animal San, the Mononoke Hime. Neither are villains, but see the world through their own experiences. Eboshi, in particular, is fascinating; she is a female ruler in feudal Japan, cares deeply for Iron Town, and gives work to prostitutes and lepers in a time when they would have been marginalized. Yakul, Ashitaka's loyal friend, and the Kodama are unforgettable and vital additions to the Studio Ghibli pantheon, as is the omniscent, yet apathetic Forest Spirit---a singular creation. The scene when he heals Ashitaka in the pool is simply sublime, one of the most gorgeously animated in the film, with its compelling use of sound and silence. Of course, there's also the stunning music score by Joe Hisaishi at his best that sweeps you from the very beginning. This is Miyazaki firing on all cylinders, his tremendous creativity, his level of craftsmanship and detail, the maturity of his film, how he remains ever optimistic that we may co-exist with nature. His passion and compassion are inspiring. I think this may be the greatest animated movie ever made and comes with my highest recommendation, both the Japanese/with English subtitles and the English version, particularly the magnificent voice-over work of Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson.",1454025600,2,2470,5.068796068796069

1318091,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke is one of the finest animated features I have ever seen. From the very beginning, it captures the viewer's imagination and continues to captivate even as its length exceeds the two-hour mark. The film is well-known for its environmental message and stunning animation, but it deserves equal praise for its well-drawn characters, dynamic action sequences, and compelling narrative.

Princess Mononoke tells the story of Ashitaka, a courageous warrior who, soon into the movie, battles a cursed boar god on a rampage in his homeland. Ashitaka is able to slay the beast, but just before he does, it latches onto him and afflicts him with its curse.

In an effort to lift the curse, which he soon finds is deadly, Ashitaka heads west. Along the way, he discovers several mystical creatures in the forest, one of them being the beautiful San, a young girl who lives among wolves and despises humans, yet who must somehow reconcile her antagonism to mankind with her own humanity and her fondness for Ashitaka. After emerging from the woods, Ashitaka becomes acquainted with the workers at a mining colony whose weapons, he learns, have inflicted this curse upon him.

Finding himself in a conflict between the workers of the mining colony, who wish to advance their civilization at the expense of the natural world, and the forest gods, who have declared all humans as the enemy, Ashitaka must choose between fighting alongside the forest gods as well as San, whom he cares deeply for, and defending his own kind.

In a riveting war between man and beast, the creatures of the forest are left with no choice but to retaliate against the humans' progressively hostile and encroaching way of life. An epic battle ensues, one that, while imbued with fantasy and myth, is surprisingly relevant to the world at large. In depicting the disconnect between man and nature, the film posseses true allegorical significance as, even amid great chaos and suffering, it contains rare moments of redemption and peace.",1446940800,4,2016,5.008955223880597
1318092,5,B00003CXBK,"I have owned a Princess Mononoke movie my entire life.  My oldest sister got a DVD copy for Christmas in 1997.  I now own a Blu Ray DVD.  I love this movie and usually watch it once a month. I remember my sisters watching it when I was too young to watch it.  I caught little peeks of different scenes and I was happy when my parents finally let me watch the entire movie.  It is an animated movie but there is some bad language and blood and gore.  But the movie is like a fantasy or a myth and the blood and gore don't seem real.  Still, I would recommend no one under 12 watch this movie.
The artwork is beautifully animated and the story is intense with many unpredictable turns.  Studio Ghibli creates my favorite movies.  I have seen a lot of movies especially Disney movies and they cant compare.  Their movies are so predictable now that I just find them boring.
I have watched this movie on regular DVD and Blu Ray DVD.  The best way to watch this movie at home is on a Blue Ray DVD.  The colors are so vivid and bring to life this fictional Japanese Iron Town village.",1446681600,,1078,4.179611650485437

1318137,5,B00003CXBK,"Taking place in medieval Japan, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) is the last prince of the Emishi people. His village is attacked by a boar possessed by a demon. He kills it in a battle, but the demon infects him with a curse that is slowly killing him. With no choice but to face exile from his people, he sets off on a journey to find a cure and encounters a village iron workers, the mysterious woman San (Claire Danes) who was raised by wolves, and a variety of strange spirits.

This is truly one of the most epic animated films I have ever seen. It features some of the best use of traditional, 2D animation to be seen. It also features a good story and some interesting characters. Unlike some other films, the conflict is not a black-and-white or good guy versus bad guy story. Each side in the conflicts has legitimate reasons for what they do and it really is up to the viewer to decide if there are really any villains. It is movies like this that really show what can be done with animation intended for a mature audience without pandering to the lowest common denominator.

1318142,4,B00003CXBK,"I've saved myself for this movie for several years, long looking forward to seeing it, knowing it's considered Miyakazi's master work.  I won't belabor points that have been made by others, for example, in one and two-star reviews, just state them quickly: 1) the Americanized dialogue is often mediocre and counter to the spirit and splendor of the original Japanese.  There are numerous examples I could give, but I won't, just say that the dialogue, style, and tone of voice of Billy Bob Thornton, the ox-driver Kokoro, and supporting cast (soldiers cat-calling in the background, people squealing, jeering, etc.) are often incongruous and set the wrong tone.  I made the mistake of watching the English dub first.  Without exactly knowing why I just found some scenes ""off"", the tone uneven.  The Japanese dialogue needed no ""punching up"" but American filmmakers are fond of hype and extraneous ""color"", sigh.

Just listen to the original Japanese soundtrack (for attitude and tone of voice), and read the literal English translation of the original dialogue, it's much better.  I hate it anyway when modern American slang and wisecracks muddy historical or mythical productions, and that's what the translators have done.  The time frame here is roughly the 14th century.  In Thornton's scenes the tone along with the dialogue is all wrong- he's playing some cool, possibly beat generation cat and speaking in modern cliches.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** In the scene where Ashitaka saves and then escorts Kokoro back home, and the Kodama (baby tree spirits) appear, in the Americanized version Kokoro alternately whimpers and shrieks.  In other scenes he sounds like a catty hairdresser.  NONE of this is in the original.  I didn't compare Jada Pinkett-Smith's lines (but her scenes are semi-comical, she plays a smart-aleck, so not as big a deal).  Tone-wise Billy Crudup, Clare Danes, Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson all did a great job- formal, sincere, classy, in keeping with the original, but again the modern Anglicized dialogue was sometimes incongruous.

That said, the animation was fantastic, of course, a thing to behold, along with the music.  I own all of Miyakazi's other films-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00V3QQF6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite movies of all time.  One thing extraordinary about Miyazaki is the complexity of his characters- bad guys aren't all bad and good guys aren't all good, and people/beings vary according to the situation. Though I might be in the minority, thematically and emotionally I think Spirited Away is a better film that Princess Mononoke, has more emotional and psychological depth (a matter of personal taste, of course). Princess Mononoke is about humanity's relationship with nature, along with self-serving interests, aggression, mistrust, and greed.  Its themes and scale are grand, universal.  Spirited Away has many of these same themes along with love, courage, generosity, trust, etc.  It looks at these themes on a more intimate level.

In a nutshell I thought Princess Mononoke was very good (in Japanese), original and evocative, like nothing else and must-viewing, but that Spirited Away was even better (if not in terms of animation, though it's lovely, in terms of themes, and HEART).  I say all this in case you, too, are seeing this for the first time with high expectations and great anticipation.

1318177,5,B00003CXBK,"When I first started watching Studio Ghibli (this was when I was around 10 or 11), I noticed ""Princess Mononoke"", but initially dismissed it because of its rating: PG-13 for images of violence of gore. It wasn't until I was almost 17 that I finally watched it. Needless to say, my breath was taken away (as Studio Ghibli films tend to do).
Studio Ghibli films are pretty unconventional, and ""Princess Mononoke"" is no expection. But I guess I was right to ignore it as a kid: this is pretty much the most violent of both Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki's movies. So if you are planning on watching it with your children, you might want to rethink it. There's plenty of adult-related content, such as blood and scary images and intense sequences of battle-related action (Okay, I sound like someone from the MPAA, don't I?). But beneath all that violence is a stirring and beautifully animated/voiced story: the story of the last Emishi prince Ashitaka, who sets out to lift a deadly curse, and ultimately finds himself falling in love with the beautiful San, the titular Princess Mononoke. Ashitaka also finds himself as what will be either the restoration of the balance or what will bring destruction to the world.
Overall, I agree with many critics and audiences think. ""Princess Mononoke"" is definitely a masterpiece, an epic too fantastic and engrossing to miss. Five stars for Hayao Miyazaki!",1443312000,,1391,4.8734177215189876

The young boy named Ashitaka is left with a situation that endangers his life and he ends up crossing paths with a perplexing young woman named San who enchants him with her beauty and who was raised by wolves. Both San and Ashitake end up seeing a lot, such as a forest spirit who has the gift of bringing great healing and saving a living being from dying if the spirit sees that they are meant to live.

1318241,5,B00003CXBK,Another great film by Miyazaki although this one is darker than some of his other stories with parts that would defiantly scare small kids. As well as the fact that there are some visceral battle sequences. This is still a beautifully animated film. The story takes place in medieval Japan as the  Tatara clan uses technology and puts it in conflict with the spirits of nature. Ashitaka a young warrior kills a boar  monsters he is 'poisoned' by the beast turned from a forest spirit to a demon by his rage. In order to be healed Ashitaka searches for the benevolent spirit of the forest to heal him. He finds things are not so simple when he finds that another human a young girl is there but she fights on the side of the forest having been abandoned there as a baby. This is proof that animation doesn't mean it is for children as this is a movie where you need to pay attention to understand the politics and the story. A great film even for people who do not necessarily like anime.,1441411200,,987,4.387978142076503

DUBTITLES. Yes, that's right, you heard right, the subtitle track on this Blu-Ray release is not in fact an English translation of the original Japanese dialogue, it's just a straight up transcript of the English dub. You might as well be watching the dub in that case. Come on, you guys think I couldn't remember the changes to the script? I know that girl with the dagger wasn't Ashitaka's sister. I know Miyazaki never wrote the phrase ""donkey piss"" into his screenplay.

Y'all thought you could pull a fast one on me, huh Disney? Well actually you did 'cause I ended up buying the damn thing.

Listen, if you're an obsessive Ghibli freak weirdo like me who needs to watch everything in its original language while reading an accurate translation of the original dialogue, spend the extra 15-20 dollars on the Japanese Blu-ray. Not only does that come with the English dub as well, but it also comes with English subtitles for the Japanese audio track. Plus, the artwork on the Blu-ray container is amazing.

This film had a bit blood and violence like the beheading and the shooting. This film is about humans in a war against the forest gods, and a cursed warrior prince in a search for a cure. This film takes place during the Medieval Era in Japan, a proud warrior prince of a small village was infected with a nasty curse which can control hatred, fear, and anger after he killed a corrupted boar demon. His village exiled him in order to find a cure from the west. The curse is a gift to the prince like he can fire a arrow faster, and he can behead someone with a shot from his arrow, but four dangerous problems of the curse: It can control his anger and fear, it worsens if he gets angry or afraid, he will be a threat to someone and himself. During his travel to the west, he meets a monk and two problems: the curse and a village full of outcasts who were led by a corrupt woman who is on a war against the forest gods who were protected by a beautiful woman who was raised by wolves. In order to get the cure, the prince has to get through the war between the humans and the forest gods. I gave this film a 5 star rating and I recommended this film.",1428969600,,1269,4.08

Young prince Ashitaka is called upon to search out the root of evil that is plaguing the Gods, ultimately affecting the lands they oversee. The movie has a wonderful layered cast of characters and a story that is in depth for adults but not too confusing to enjoy.

The characters are one of the best developed by Miyazaki and here they play vital roles in the outcome that will determine how man lives in harmony with his environment.

That aside, the story is just so so.  It's nothing exceptional.  I didn't even finish the last of the movie because it just kept getting worse and falling flatter.

The story was unique and really got a hold of me. I wasn't once bored or lost interest.

1319411,5,B00003CXBK,"This review is for the Japanese Blu-Ray version of the film, part of the Studio Ghibli Collection.

Princess Mononoke was my first Ghibli film. An older cousin had introduced me to anime as a child with taped copies of Macross, Gundam and the like, but I came to Miyazaki's work late.  I was not fortunate enough to see it upon its tiny American theatrical run, but when the DVD was originally released by Buena Vista in 2000 I had to grab it, both having seen small clips of it. It holds a special place in my heart with its lush colors, compelling characters, moving music, and incredibly fluid and detailed animation. Because of this, I was shocked and surprised when I would read later of Buena Vista's lackluster treatment of the film's release in the US.  Mononoke is the film from which was derived the perhaps apocryphal tale of Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki sending a katana to Miramax's Harvey Weinstein - ""no cuts"" was the demand from Ghibli for the film's US release.

Due to some understandable business concerns of international divisions of Buena Vista, the original Japanese audio was not planned for the US DVD release, but was included after a swelling of fan support, along with an excellent English subtitle translation. It was wonderful to see that Buena Vista did right by the film for that release. The DVD has been an often-played part of my library since then.

In the years since Blu-Ray was adopted as the High Definition standard, I've been waiting (sometimes not so) patiently for Mononoke to get the treatment it deserves. And lo, Ghibli did the deed in late 2013, while Buena Vista released the US edition less than a year after. Comparisons began to surface soon afterward.

Now comes the moment when Buena Vista drops the ball: the US version of the blu-ray contains ""dubtitles"". Not properly translated subtitles, the text displayed while playing the Japanese audio is merely the subtitles of the English dub version. It may seem a trifling difference, but for myself and many others who well loved the previous DVD subtitles, this is a dealbreaker. I'd waited years for Buena Vista to deliver, and when they do, it's substandard. At this point I decided to take the gamble and locate the Japanese blu-ray. I'm very glad I did, and am sure I made the correct decision.

Positive points:
-The Japanese edition of the blu-ray contains the subtitle track that was originally included in the US DVD, with some small minor edits. Score.
-The English dub track is also present in 5.1. I have never really had an interest in viewing the movie in English, but it's very nice to know it's there. There's also a raft of other audio tracks, including French, Spanish, Italian, German, among others.
-Despite being a cardboard digipak-style case, the packaging feels extremely solid and well-built. The disc itself stores well, and didn't seem to come dislodged during shipping. Included is what appears to be a registration card and a small booklet with poster artwork.
-The spartan artwork works well - all the discs in the Japanese Studio Ghibli collection are in the same style, with white characters on a colored field, and they look great on your shelf.
-Japan is located in Blu-Ray region A/1, which means this disc will work in all players in that region, including the Americas.

Negative points:
-Not much is done with the blu-ray menus. They're in the same style as the cover artwork - simple, dichromatic. It's a minor point that doesn't detract from enjoyment of the film.
-Obviously being intended for the Japanese audience, all the menus are in Japanese. It can make things difficult for someone who doesn't read the language. Fortunately, the LANG/SUB buttons on your player remote should work fine.
-The extras are, like the packaging, a bit spartan. Trailers for other Ghibli movies. Hayao Miyazaki appears in a video promoting the original release in the US.

Purchasing this blu-ray has been effective in convincing me to import more of the Studio Ghibli Collection from Japan, and they have all lived up to my expectations. The cost is, like most media in Japan, significant compared to the US - cover price is 6800.  It's worth it, and Amazon shipping from Japan is not a bankbreaker. If, like me, you have been disgruntled the Buena Vista treatment, please feel secure in ordering the Japanese edition to allay your disappointment.",1420416000,13,4369,4.860215053763441

1319627,1,B00003CXBK,"Note this review is ONLY meant for anyone who finds their way to this film via Miyazaki's beautiful film, My Neighbor Totoro, and is hoping for more of the same (or similar).

My neighbor loaned me Totoro when my toddler son and I were down for the count with a bad cold and were holed up at home having a movie marathon. We fell head over heels IN LOVE with its beauty, serenity, mystery, magic, music, depth, spirit of fun... it was true love. Watched it four times in two days (my son kept requesting it).

I ordered my own copy from Amazon and added Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke hoping for more of Miyazaki's mysterious captivating worlds and excited by all the positive reviews. Just watched them today.

Eek!

This is NOT a commentary on the quality of these films. But know that if you're hoping for what Totoro is, these are NOT that. They are not sweet, even if they have a sweet(ish) moment here and there. They are violent, graphic, loud and much faster-paced than Totoro (think blood - lots!, dismemberment, demons eating people, scary villains, clamor of sounds of fighting or crowds, etc etc; not the bittersweet mystical country life of Totoro). I actually felt like they were innapropriate for my young kid. And, frankly, they were often too graphic and violent for me to enjoy too (though I find the stories fascinating, I just didn't enjoy them in the way I had hoped to based on my love affair with Totoro).

Just buyer beware IF Totoro is how you landed here. And if you plan to share these with young children. My one star rating is to get your attention IF this is you. :-)",1418169600,10,1602,4.510344827586207

1319635,1,B00003CXBK,"Rating is not for movie, which is incredible, but for the lack of a proper subtitle track for watching the movie in Japanese. The subtitle track included is for the English dub, and not a proper translation of the Japanese dialogue. This is a mistake that severely needs to be fixed, or I'll just have to start importing for the Japanese edition. Come on Disney, is it so difficult?",1417737600,24,382,4.550724637681159
1319685,3,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke has been called everything from a masterpiece to ""The Star Wars of Animated Features"". It's an immortal classic and one of Ghibli's finest adventure films.

I've watched the film probably 20 times on various formats, including a 35mm print at the Belcourt in Nashville (once subtitled and once dubbed), and this blu-ray bests them all. An absolutely stunning transfer with no notable problems that I could detect. It seems free of any artificial tampering or sharpening, unlike the UK releases.

Unfortunately, I wish Disney had extended the same care and respect to the audio. Inexplicably, Disney has only provided subtitles to the English dub of the film, which is, to put it bluntly, a little Americanized. There are hundreds of small changes to the dialogue, which as anyone who has seen the film can attest to, is rife with poetry and is distinctly Japanese. I can't imagine anyone involved in the making of this film is happy about this decision and as a die-hard fan of Miyazaki and this film, I am extremely disappointed.

What this essentially means is that it is impossible to watch Princess Mononoke in its original version on this blu-ray. It is important to note that Disney has extended this same bizarre decision-making to the Kiki's Delivery Service blu-ray. So, Americans will have to buy expensive imports if they want to see these films in HD with the original dialogue. What a wasted opportunity.",1417737600,9,1435,4.970833333333333

1319781,2,B00003CXBK,"Disney certainly has a hit-and-miss record with Ghibli titles, but I figured this would be a safe pre-order.  The DVD turned out reasonably well, and I was excited to get an upgrade in sound an picture quality, without having to pay the high prices for the import that I have had to for decent Kiki and Omohide Poroporo (Only Yesterday) blu-rays.  This was a mistake I will not make again with Disney localizations of Ghibli products.  The previous DVD already had decent subtitles, so who would have expected they would drop these for dub-titles?  If you already understand a little japanese, this is pretty difficult to sit through as your brain tries to process two different messages, and for though who don't understand any japanese, you have lost any reason for watching it subtitled, other than to get a different set of voice actors.  I recommend anyone who plans to watch this subtitled to stick with the DVD or import from Japan.",1416700800,19,939,4.771604938271605
1319782,2,B00003CXBK,"Okay, so I love this movie. It was one of the first Ghibli movies I had seen back in high school, and really got me into their films. I still have a copy of the original DVD release. I got the Blu-Ray/DVD combo on Friday, and I am going to be returning it this Sunday. Dubtitles* are one thing, but poor picture quality for the DVD? Unacceptable. As I don't have a Blu-Ray player, I will admit that I have no way of knowing how it looks in that medium. Seeing as how Disney is really cheaping out on their DVD releases, this is probably not a good thing.

You want to see this movie? Get a copy of the original DVD release. There may not be much in the extras department there, but you want the authentic Mononoke experience, you'll be doing yourself a favor.

*Dubtitles- when the script for the English adaptation (which can take liberties with the original script) is used instead of a translation of the original wording. ""This soup tastes like hot water."" becomes ""Are you selling soup or donkey piss?"" in the English adaptation.

1319788,1,B00003CXBK,"The Princess Mononoke DVD from 2000 included the original Japanese audio track with excellent English subtitles (done by Stephen Albert and Haruyo Moriyoshi) translated from the Japanese dialogue. However, in this new Blu-ray release, the English subtitles are a complete disaster of embarrassing proportions.

Disney could have easily included the original English subtitles, or even gone so far as to use the translations on the Studio Ghibli Japanese Blu-ray release (which were different from the 2000 DVD, but just as proper a translation of the original Japanese dialogue, credited to a company called Aura with dialogue adaptation by Jim Hubbert). In both or either case, these translations are mindful of Japanese cultural context and apply an attention to additional detail such that (for example) the names of Japanese voice actors and key production staff members in the end credits are translated correctly.

Disney's new Blu-ray release utilizes neither of these fine translations, opting instead for a literal transcript of the adapted English language dubbing script. Even the bonus DVD uses the English dub script instead of the proper translations from the original DVD. So if you have the original Princess Mononoke DVD and prefer the Japanese track with proper translations, you'd better keep that disc!

If Disney ever fixes those subtitles and re-releases this Blu-ray, I'll revise my review accordingly. But until then, this is an inferior release (unless you're only ever going to listen to the English dub with no subtitles).",1416355200,41,1549,5.392561983471074
1319789,1,B00003CXBK,"This is one of the greatest animated films ever made, but Disney has made a mockery of this blu-ray release by using the word-for-word English dub script as the English subtitle track. The sad thing is, only a small percentage of film buffs will care, meaning that they probably won't rectify the error and there never will be a solid release of Mononoke Hime on blu-ray in the USA.

The 2000 Miramax DVD release of this film includes an English subtitle track that is a literal interpretation of the Japanese language, and it also incorporates Japanese cultural references. This literal translation is a key aspect of appreciating the cultural nuances of this film, because let's face it, the English voice cast and dub script is terrible. (This was one of the first of Miyazaki's films brought over for the American market, and John Lasseter wasn't producing terrific VO work for Miyazaki films at this point.)

Todd Doogan over at the Digital Bits (thedigitalbits.com) has the full scoop on this release, and he gives it an ""A"" for picture quality and a ""D"" for the error regarding the subtitle track. I suggest reading it before considering a purchase of this blu ray - you might be better off importing a copy from Japan",1416355200,67,1225,4.773584905660377

1319828,3,B00003CXBK,"Word of warning for those who will be watching this with the Japanese audio and subtitles. The subtitles appear to be dubtitles of the English audio script, which is (at least for me) a big fail by Disney. This is why I prefer the dedicated anime distributors in the US (Funimation, Sentai, Viz, etc.) actually release these titles, rather than a company like Disney. Using dubtitles makes watching with the Japanese audio a painful experience (especially if you have okay Japanese language skills). This is the same thing Disney did with Castle in the Sky.

The environment and characters are rich and well developed. The voice acting is superb and it is an overall great immersion.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 13. Because, though this is an animated Ghibli Movie it is definitely not for kids. Lots of blood and dismemberment.",1415750400,2,559,4.524752475247524

1320102,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke is lauded by many as one of the greatest productions to come out of Studio Ghibli, and will continue to keep it's place at the top of my list of favorite movies of all time. I have owned the DVD edition more than once (a testament to the wear and tear I put my original copy through) and have even considered purchasing the pricey (and visually pleasing) Japanese Ghibli release (along with a couple of the other Ghibli films).

After watching My Neighbor Totoro, imagine my surprise at the very different tone present in this film. But this film fascinated me to no end. As a young child I found myself in awe at the maturity of the story, of the blood and the violence, of the level of surrealism, and at the same time realism, of the world in this film. As I grew older, I found that this film had a profoundly huge influence in my expectations of animated features, even when compared with Ghost in the Shell or Akira. Let us not even mention the stark contrast between features like this one and the many American animated features that are made with only children in mind.

A brief, and non-spoiling summary: Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) a prince of a small tribe in a remote mountain region is injured by a demonic creature after it rampages through his village. His injury at the hands of the demon curses him. He leaves the village in order to find the cause of this curse, and hopefully find a way to remove it. In his travels he comes across an industrial village called ""Iron Town,"" run by Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver) which has lately been under assault from a pack of wolves including a wild human girl, San (Claire Danes). Ashitaka finds himself caught between their ever-escalating confilct, trying to show them a path peace and co-existence, while still battling the curse that threatens to consume him.

Nearly everything about this film is impressive, even in this modern era. From the story, to the animation, to the character and environment designs, to the ""protect and cherish nature"" subtext of it's story.

The art of the film is lush and rich in design, every character and environment is unique, even when compared with other Ghibli releases which have all come to posses an all-too-similar style these days. The spirits and creatures can range from simple and cute, to ornate and beautiful, to monstrous and disturbing.

The voice acting is par for the course but not quite as impressive as other areas of the film. Now, I can only speak for the english dub, as I have not watched it with the Japanese dub. Billy Crudup is probably the weakest of the talent in this, which is a sad statement considering he voices the main protagonist of the story, but this is in stark contrast to nearly all the other characters, Minnie Driver does a great job as Lady Eboshi, and even more minor characters have great actors attached to them who add something unique to remember. I was particularly impressed with Keith David as Okkoto.

The story is very well written, the english script having been penned by renowned author Neil Gaiman (of Sandman fame). The dialogue is never too awkward but always flows smoothly, and never suffers too badly from improper word/animation timing, which can be quite horrendous with anime and dubbed Asian films.

Overall, if you enjoy anime at all and are looking for something different, something unique, this is a film for you. If you enjoy any of Ghibli's modern films and have yet to view some of the older ones, this is a film for you.

This is one of those movies that stays with you, much like Unico and The sea prince and the Fire child. When i first saw this, i was blown away by the art style and score, beautifully written and voice acted. I would not be the person I am today if it wasn't for this film!

In my opinion this is the greatest anime film Miyazaki has ever made, and is a great movie for the whole family. The only thing I can nag about this film is the voice acting isn't perfect, but I can't possibly give it less than 5 stars just for that. The artwork is stunning, beyond most anime, and the story is wonderful, and has just the right amount of complexity to appeal to adults but still be a good pick for children (minus the occasional violent scenes).

1320532,5,B00003CXBK,"This movie was recommended by a friend after I was blown away by ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and ""Spirited Away"" both produced by Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki has a knack for getting you totally engrossed in his films and ""Princess Mononoke"" is a testament to that. This movie is not as long as ""HMC"" or ""SA"", but is equally as entertaining. This film is art and storytelling at its best!",1399939200,,378,4.573529411764706

This movie wins every award for everything in my book: animation, narrative, design, inventiveness, heart and beauty. It does not have a single flaw.

Wait. That's not true. Do not listen to the English audio version: they made some very poor voice casting choices. Billy Bob Thornton??! Really? A guy with a Southern drawl  should NOT have been cast as a Japanese monk and Gillian Anderson (or any woman) should not have been cast as the voice of Moro, the Wolf God and San's mother. I love the gruff, multi-faceted creepy voice they gave her and the English version ruins the entire character for me. (Don't get me wrong, nothing against Southerners OR women ;)).
The Japanese version is great.

While it is not a children's movie and does have some graphic and scary scenes, I know at least 3 children under 10 that have seen this movie and loved it (albeit curled up with dad) so you may just judge for yourself.",1398902400,,1075,4.647368421052631

Princess Mononoke was the first anime movie i ever watched and i instantly fell in love. the Japanese culture is so different from that of americans and Miyazaki's wonderful imagination makes for some incredible animation. this is my favorite of the miyazaki/ studio ghibli films and by far my favorite animated feature. very highly recommended.,1398816000,,599,5.05050505050505

The cel animation looks extraordinary in 1080p, and the 8 channel DTS-HD MA Japanese soundtrack is rich and clean. This release also includes the English dub in 6 channel Dolby Digital (finally), among other languages and subtitles so this is more like an international release. The disc has about 25 minutes of extras, which are mostly trailers, but the best is a mini documentary on the release of the film in the US (English subtitled.) The menu is in Japanese, which navigating is intuitive but it is easier to just use the audio/subtitle buttons on the remote.

1320658,5,B00003CXBK,I remember watching this when it first came to the states and loving it. At some point I had lost my copy so I had to buy a new one and I am so glad I did. The voice acting is great and the larger-than-life characters will make you want more.

1320713,5,B00003CXBK,"Wow.  I feel like an idiot for waiting so long to watch this spectacular achievement in animation.  It's an epic masterpiece from a man used to creating masterpieces, Hayao Miyazaki.  The plot is dense and rich, an awe inspiring cautionary tale of greed, the ruination of our environment.  It is not a film for children.  There's a great deal of violence and gore, people lose their heads and limbs with alarming regularity.  But war is hell.  I couldn't stand the English dub so I viewed it in the original Japanese with English subtitles.  It makes a great difference and stays true to the intent of the artist.  Watch with eyes unclouded.",1394755200,,641,4.702702702702703

Advice if you get this on Blu Ray. Everything is in Japaneses, meaning the main menu text, so finding the setup section to change it to English dub was a pain in the ass.

-To change it, take your remote and move the bar to the third section. At the screen, move it three down for the English Dubbed. It will then take you to the other side for sub text, Go to, what i think, is the first or second one down for NO sub text. Then it will take you back to the main menu and just hit play.",1394668800,,541,3.864864864864865

1320925,5,B00003CXBK,"I shouldn't have to explain much after the title. It just is. Now, this is not a whimsical, light hearted, song-and -dance film. I is a serious film, with a complex plot that may require multiple viewings to understand. The story revolves around Ashitaka, a man with a cursed arm who searches for its' source, and a possible cure, before it kills him. He finds himself trying to pacify the relationships between 3 separate groups all fighting for the same cut of land and a fourth using the conflict to their own ends. Each character is so multidimensional that it becomes difficult to classify any as heroes and villains (except Ashitaka, who is definitely a hero) they're simply human. Yes even the forest spirits. this is a story of moral ambiguity, human advancement versus nature, the seduction of greed, and redemption. Also, I usually don't like love stories in movies because they seem to just make for subplots that fill space, but the love story here is fantastic, an odd Romeo and Juliet story that adds a very large depth to the story and characters. The Animation? Perfect. I can't say much more that that, it is seamless, gorgeous to look at, it is a Miyazaki film, we should expect it. Overall this is a great film, not necessarily something for kids (scary images and massive amounts of blood)but something everyone should try to see at least once in their life.",1391040000,,1378,4.721991701244813

The characters show a wide range of types and emotions, there are selfish ones, angry ones, greedy ones, giving ones, cowardly ones and brave ones.  The characters are multi-dimensional and show growth.  The story itself has multiple levels.  It teaches many lessons, the danger of letting anger and hatred rule you, the necessity for preserving forests, and the importance of treating every human being as an equal regardless of gender, social status or health.  This film also explores the concept of god vs man and what happens when man shows disregard for anything beyond himself.

Princess Mononoke is darker than some of the other films by Studio Ghibli but that doesn't mean it is not as good!  This story is one of my favorites, it is beautiful, moving and an absolute must see!
If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli movies you have to see this one!  If you like anime in general; you have to see this movie!

1321058,5,B00003CXBK,"It is hard to pin down Princess Mononoke with a simple review. For its time, it was a very ground breaking anime. Though it wasn't advertised much, it ended up assisting in changing Americans perception of anime and allowed more people to be receiving of this genre and paved the way for Miyazaki's movie to be showed on the big screen in Hollywood a few short years later (and ultimately win an Oscar)

Princess Mononoke isn't just a whimsical child's story. The themes are much deeper, and Miyazaki in his brilliance uses the conduit of anime to deliver a much meaningful overtone to the viewer. It isn't so much about good versus evil, but rather survival of the fittest and coexistence of man and nature. While new industry may be conceived through good intentions, it doesn't render the fact that it can still be dangerous and harmful. We see this in Princess Mononoke through the lens of several groups of people simply trying to survive what they consider to be a threat, even if its at the expense of another. Through its fanciful tale it brings us face to face with the reality there is a growing rift between man and nature in our ever changing world. While man adapts and grows, nature stays relatively constant and thus creates conflict. Miyazaki explores this through his motion picture, and in nearly all of his subsequent films.

Princess Mononoke is truly an iconic piece of cinema. The art and animation is something even Walt Disney himself was envious of. It easily ensnares you in the reality of what's happening within the story. Whether or not you like anime, you should not pass up a chance to watch this film at least once. At minimum, it will give you new appreciation for foreign talent, creativity, and cinema.",1387497600,,1737,4.7105263157894735

It's also a very LONG movie, it is Miazaki's longest I believe. It is 2 hours and a half, possibly nearly three. It's an incredible and powerful movie for any anime fan...but not for children.

In the end there is a large battle, but I can't spoil too much because, believe me, it get pretty crazy towards the end.
I enjoy the animation quality, and the film gets across the ""getting along"" with nature theme WITHOUT shoving it down your throat. It was written into the story very well. The characters are likable, particularly the main character, and I could in no way predict the climax. Although the very ending was a bit of a cop out, I'll admit, the entire film is worth, at the very least, a watch.",1386115200,2,947,4.325842696629214

It is a movie that requires a mature mind to appreciate, and little children will find it too scary and intense.  It's not a cartoon.  It's a serious and beautiful movie for serious minds.  Very worthwhile, don't miss it!",1385769600,,390,4.422535211267606

1321211,5,B00003CXBK,"It continually amazes me when I find people who don't appreciate this movie.  Mainly because I think it's fantastic.  Of course, that applies to almost anything that Hayao Miyazaki does.

Ashitaka is inflicted with a curse after a demon attacks his village.  Now, because he must find a way to save himself, he leaves his village forever to find the source of the demon.  A place far away that appears to be filled with hate.  But when he gets there he finds a battle being waged between the gods and spirits of the forest, and the people at Irontown who are trying to make a living for themselves.  And there's a plot to destroy the forest spirit, which could have all kinds of unforseen consequences.

Characters:
Billy Crudup: Ashitaka
Claire Danes: San
Minnie Driver: Lady Eboshi
Billy Bob Thorton: Jigo

When watching an animated film, I have to admit, I'm not really that concerned about the voices.  Because they're animated, I don't have any initial expectations on how they should sound.  So in my opinion, everbody did a good job of voicing their characters in this movie.  The characters themselves were varied and I love their personalities.  You have Ashitaka, the good guy, who is brave and strong and tries to do what is right all the time.  San, Princess Mononoke, is very strong in her convictions and vicious at the same time.  I like that she was the wild one as opposed to having Ashitaka being the wild one.  And Lady Eboshi, well if there was ever a ""grey"" character she was it.  She did so many things wrong but her heart was in the right place for a lot of it.  You just couldn't hate her despite what she was doings.  Simply amazing.

The plot is a common one.  The ""earth"" against the humans trying to destroy it.  But the humans are likable.  Which just confuses everything.  Add into this a little bit of a love story, some humor, and being that all think they are doing the right thing, and you have an epic story right there.  And I think the paces moves quite well.  It's not too slow, but it doesn't rush by so fast that you can't understand what is going on.  And let's be honest, anything with Kodomas (tree spirits) is just awesome.  I've always hoped they'd make an alarm clock shaped like a Kodoma that rattled its head as the alarm.  I would buy it in an instant.

I always like that in Miyazaki's work, you know it's animated, but at times there is animation that almost looks real.  Like the ripples of wind through tall grass or waves on the water.  It really adds to the experience.  And the colors are always bright and vibrant.  Lots of reds.  It's a real pleasure to view.  And the music is always understated and in the background, but it doesn't detract from the movie.  And just the images themselves are unique.  The Forest Spirit, the Kodomas, they are all interesting shapes and creatures with lots of detail.

This is one of my favorite movies and one that actually has a permanent place on my shelf.  It never gets old.

1321212,5,B00003CXBK,"Excellent dvd, official
Amazing movie, love the narrative and style
Perfect atmosphere, mature and has a message

one of Miyazaki's best",1379635200,,136,5.476190476190476
1321213,5,B00003CXBK,With its incredible story telling and its fantastic cast of voice actors Princess Mononoke has become my all-time favorite movie.  I have watched it countless times and it never gets old.  The story does a great job of capture the struggle between mankind and nature.  I wish there had been more special features but even so this is still a must buy just for movie itself.,1379462400,,372,4.606060606060606
1321243,2,B00003CXBK,"It lacks really good plot that would be similar to ""Kikki"" or ""Spirited away"". The animations are good but this is a typical action/adventure/combat film without much more.",1379030400,,172,5.178571428571429
1321244,5,B00003CXBK,"it was so great, it's time to watch it again. miyazaki is likely the best film maker of our time.",1378425600,,97,3.9
1321245,5,B00003CXBK,This is a movie that i have always loved but had never bought for myself its a great piece of work that was wonderfully done.,1377388800,,125,4.04
1321246,5,B00003CXBK,"This is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. Do yourself a favor, stop reading this, go buy it now.

Really, it's an excellent movie by Hayao Miyazaki, if like anime, and don't know that name, get yourself acquainted with it ASAP. If you don't really like anime and somehow ended up here, the best way I can describe him as sort of a Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney.

His films are ALL fantastic in their own way. This movie specifically may be a bit more violent than the rest of his works, and even more so than what most people consider standard kids films, I really feel this is appropriate for most normal kids. It's definitely no worse than Lion King, have you seen that movie recently? It's pretty brutal.

At any rate, this is one of my favorite Miyazaki movies, but probably not my absolutely favorite. Definitely one of his best I feel.",1377388800,,857,4.445859872611465
1321247,3,B00003CXBK,"Perhaps my expectations were set a little high by the quote on the box stating ""the star wars of animated features""  I think the quote should have read, ""the Fern Gully of Japan""!  Gave it three stars because I thought the animation was great but did not think the plot was that good.

May just be personal preference but I prefer anime with characters who strive to improve themselves and overcome their individual difficulties through hard work and determination. Rather, it seemed to mostly be about saving the forest.

I would recommend this movie to teenagers and environmentalists.",1376784000,,587,4.959183673469388

1321302,5,B00003CXBK,"This is one of the best movies as far as depicting the perennial tension between man and his environment is concerned! The story is fantastical and yet, grounded in reality.

1321443,3,B00003CXBK,"This movie had its ups and downs.
Plot: 2/5 A prince (that's him there in the picture) gets attacked by a demon, and is doomed to die. Before he does, he strikes out on his own to investigate. Eventually,, he makes his way to Iron Town, and the rest of his movie is about his interaction with forest spirits. It's interesting but the plot line is rather muddy.
Characters: 3/5 Complicated. That's the best way I can think to describe them. None of them seem really pure good or evil, similar to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. That much being said, the protagonist wasn't all that likable.
Setting: 3/5 High Fantasy,didn't leave much of an impression on me. It takes place in the distant past.
Animation: 5/5 Studio Ghibli's got a good reputation for its animation. I see why.
Total: 13/20 If you're already into anime, watch it. It's pretty good. If you're not, don't. The Japanese folk lore and myths mixed in here will seem completely bizarre to you. Over all, an alright movie as long as you're not disconcerted by the Japanese culture and you don't expect very fleshed out characters.",1369094400,,1093,4.61025641025641

If your only going ever buy or watch just anime in your life, then this is the one you should buy and watch.

the story and drawing's and sound track come to getter to make a compelling tale.

I show this to friend and while playing other catch a little of it and stay to see the whole thing.

if you take time to buy  this anime you will enjoy watching it it one you can enjoy watching over and over",1366761600,,435,3.954022988505747
1321528,5,B00003CXBK,"There is truly nothing bad I can say about Princess Mononoke. It was the first Miyazaki film I ever saw and I fell in love with it. Everything about it is wonderful - the animation is absolutely gorgeous, the best I've seen. Disney looks like kiddy doodles in comparison. The story is explained well - the conflict pretty much begins immediately and the rest of the film involves main character Ashitaka trying to resolve the issues he faces. Plenty of action, nice fight scenes, nothing is rushed at all, and there are so many little details that you can easily miss, but that add to the film experience sort of subconsciously. The characters are all very well-developed; I don't quite understand why the antagonist has a British accent, but it manages to work.

Possible spoilers here, but I also love that there is no happily ever after ending where Ashitaka and San get married and have a family and all that crap. I don't want to give too much away, but there is no everything turning out perfect. The film ends on a pretty good note, but not how you might expect. Which sometimes happens in real life too - stuff doesn't turn out picture perfect, but things will still work out in spite of some hardships.

Even if you're not a huge animation fan, this is still a wonderful film and I'd recommend it for the movie library of pretty much anyone. Even for anime, these characters don't have the huge freaky wading-pool eyes that some anime series have - they look pretty normal. If you're not into anime, don't let the art style discourage you - it's a worthwhile viewing experience.",1366761600,,1587,4.604240282685512

1321532,5,B00003CXBK,"I waited a long time before I could find this movie anywhere at a price that I thought would not be too high.
This was on my list of must see anime.  The artwork is beautiful, and it is a fun story if you enjoy anime.
Hayao Miyazaki is probably the most respected anime artists out there.  I collect his movies, and they never
disappoint me with the quality that is in them.  I would recommend it for older children as there is violence.
If you want to read Roger Ebert's review of the film (It was one of the best in 1999!), then just google it.
Here is some of what he said, ""Hayao Miyazaki is a great animator, and his ""Princess Mononoke"" is a great film. Do not allow conventional thoughts about animation to prevent you from seeing it. It tells an epic story set in medieval Japan, at the dawn of the Iron Age, when some men still lived in harmony with nature and others were trying to tame and defeat it. It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order. It is one of the most visually inventive films I have ever seen.""",1365379200,,1135,4.17351598173516

I don't want to give away very much at all, but this movie is amazing! Not safe for the eyes of children though, it is definately teen - adult as it can get violent at times.

1321576,5,B00003CXBK,"The animation is awesome in this, and you can tell, if you understand the process of animation. The music provides a serious, almost suspenseful mood with the dark and mystical images of this story. It's very non-Disney-like, and I like this movie due to that reason.

1321579,5,B00003CXBK,"This was the very first product I bought here on Amazon and I must say I love the service and the product itself.
I had watched this movie numerous of times but I could never find this movie anywhere and so I was recommended into trying to buy it online here on Amazon.

I had doubts about buying products online because of the fact that there are some companies that just don't give you the right quality of the product or they just ripped you off the spot like some companies (or so I heard).

And so one day I was looking around Amazon, out of curiosity, and I happen to find this movie and on top of it... a reasonable, cheap price! So I just took the chance and bought it right on the spot!

Next two weeks or so, I received my package and it was ""Princess Mononoke"". Excited as I was I played it on my DVD player and it was exactly what I not expected. The movie was excellent (meaning I bought it in ""good condition"" ""decent condition"") the subtitles are excellent! It really blown me away!

Of course the movie was PERFECTION itself. No doubt about it.
If you never seen this movie... then you are missing out! This is a MUST see movie that every animation lover must see. Consider yourself not a fan if you have not seen this movie, it is that GREAT.

To finish this review, I will continue to buy my products online and you can trust AMAZON.",1363219200,,1351,4.22093023255814
1321580,5,B00003CXBK,Beautifully drawn animation (classic animation - hand drawn art which is losing to computers - too bad) Hayao Miyazaki is the master who all other animators should strive to emulate.,1363219200,,182,5.1
1321581,4,B00003CXBK,Hayao Miyazaki has a very creative imagination combine with japanese culture together is pretty awesome. Although I think its pretty violent for my kids to watch.,1363219200,,162,5.269230769230769
1321582,5,B00003CXBK,"I never thought I would like Anime and resisted watching it for years. My Japanese daughter-in-law turned me on to this type of entertainment. I am 60 years old and love this movie. The artwork is amazing. I have never seen anything like it. Shadows, breaking of branches, leaves blowing. It is amazing. The people look like cartoons, albeit well-illustrated, but meld easily into the extremely realistic scenery. The story is great. Kept my interest for the whole time. It starts off a little ""fake"" with a giant boar but give it time. It really develops into an amazing story the whole family will enjoy. I have been watching many of Miyazaki's movies now. They are all good and different. You won't be disappointed.
Update: I just got a gift certificate for Christmas and bought this DVD. I watched it last night for the second time and was even more impressed. So much detail and forethought into the drawings and characters. There is a scene, in the beginning, where the male lead takes his bow off his shoulder and restrings it. I mean, how many illustrators would think of that? Most ""cartoons"" would just have the person shooting the bow. The shadows, the fog and rain...amazing artwork. But it isn't that alone. The stroy is really good and send a good message on protecting the planet. I have not watched the English-speaking part yet...I just love hearing the Japanese inflections. Could not believe how much strong language was used. Cursing on a cartoon? I didn't mind it. It fit the scene but I am guessing that the English-speaking option does not have it especially since Disney now owns it. Funny, touching and dramatic movie that I would have to put on my top movies of all time if watched in Japanese with English subtitles.",1363132800,3,1743,4.7368421052631575

Princess Mononoke is a little violent, so if you're getting it for kids, just be aware.  Ponyo, Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service are my two year old son's favorites. =)",1362096000,,317,4.625
1321607,1,B00003CXBK,"So let me start out by saying that i love this movie. It is, in my opinion the best Ghibli movie. This review is only one star because of the horrible experience i had with the seller Ultimate Discounts Canada. I was super excited when my DVD came in the mail... I hadn't seen Princess Mononoke since my VCR stoped working years ago.
So imagine my disappointment when i try to watch the movie and i cannot because the sound quality is so horrible. On both the original Japanese and dubbed English tracks, the background music and noise is loud and crackly, while the diologue is garbled, and muffled to the point of inaudiblility! It is really bizarre, I almost think it might be a bootleg copy!
So i contacted the seller right away (2 days after i got the DVD) but of course i never heard back from them. So i wrote a pretty rough seller review for them, thinking that may prompt some action, over a month later and i still haven't heard from them.
So the lesson to be learned from this is not to buy anything from Ultimate Discounts Canada, even though they had the best price for the movie, i should have just paid an extra three to five dollars and bought it from an honest seller.

P.S. I still haven't watched Princess Mononoke again....",1362009600,5,1243,4.404347826086957

While visiting a friend a few years ago, he exposed me to some of the ""good stuff"" and I now have a completely new respect for anime. One of the films he showed me was Mononoke.

This film has the feeling of epic folklore. It was well done and even the American voice-overs (for an American who has had no exposure to oriental languages) were in character.

I consider this film a classic.",1361836800,,508,4.326315789473684

1321612,3,B00003CXBK,"A friend recommended this movie, after I mentioned how much I enjoyed ""Howl's Moving Castle"" -which is far superior IMHO. This movie was long, violent, and plot wise just had a ton of ideology thrown at me. All the back and forth traveling, giving messages, got tiresome. Was that really needed? Story means storehouse, a place where things are kept. Give me those things but spare me the 2 hours plus to do so. Ugh. Should have been better than it was.
This being 2013, the material/message seemed dated. But I knew that going into it. So, if you enjoy animation at it's finest, you will enjoy this one. The Amercian voices are very good, though not entirely accurate-as said. Characters are pretty one dimensional-typical of the Japanese medium on anime. Oh, with the decapitations, this is not for children-be warned. Hope this helps.",1361491200,,837,4.819444444444445

1321663,5,B00003CXBK,"This is by far my favorite movie from Studio Ghibli.  This epic tale is full of adventure, beautiful artwork, and a moving story.  It incorporates a lot of more traditional elements of Japanese religion (I am no expert, however), e.g. many forest spirits.

One thing I love most about Ghibli movies (especially this one) is the complex world they paint.  ""Good"" and ""evil"" are not black and white, heavily divided elements.  Rather, many characters do evil things with good intentions, and sometimes the ""good guys"" are full of hatred and darkness.  Far from being overly cynical, I think they speak truly of real life, where no one is entirely good or entirely evil.  And at the end of the day, Ghibli always gives a message of hope for redemption and reconciliation.

A warning, however: this movie is rated PG-13 for good reason.  I think it would be great for High School and older because of the violence and (primarily) because the plot can be intricate and the messages more mature.  Just because it is a ""cartoon"" does not mean it's for kids!  This is a must see for anyone who appreciates fantasy, beauty, nature/ecology, or a good epic.",1360886400,,1146,4.737373737373737

Animation, but the plotline is not cutesy at all. The characters get hurt. Its not for very young children unless they have been immunised to screen violence, and following the plot does require actually watching, and not skipping huge chunks of the movie.

1321834,4,B00003CXBK,"The Gods are not dead. They live. But they are not alone. Demon-Gods live too. And they do battle against the Gods. Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke (Princess Monster), now the 11th consecutive SG film that I have watched. Once Japan was densely covered with forests. But now many of them are gone as humans continue to expand and cut down the trees. Far in the East, there live the Emishi. Here, a young prince is attacked by a Demon-God. The film is about Prince Ashitaka's quest to recover from the poison inflicted on him as he killed a Demon-God. Journeying far to the West, to an ancient forest (modeled on Yakushima), Ashitaka finds himself caught in the struggle between the representatives of the forest and the men and women of Tataraba (Iron Town). Ashitaka represents balance and a way forward for both the forest denizens and for the people of Tataraba. But will they be able to move forward without killing each other first?

Princess Mononoke is one of the more famous Studio Ghibli films. And rightfully so. The tale is epic and the animation is beautiful. And though I liked the film, I think I still prefer some earlier SG films like My Neighbor Totoro, and some of the later films like Spirited Away and Ponyo.

1321879,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke came out near the beginning of my adolescence and was the first Hayao Miyazaki movie I ever saw: It dramatically set the stage for my deep love of Miyazaki/Ghibli movies and Japanese animation in general. It goes without saying that I am now a complete convert and as a general rule I enjoy anime more than western movies/television (nothing can beat a good Paul Newman flick though). I'm not so good at intellectual reviews so I'll just go through a few main pros and points about this movie:

*I am an outdoor girl. I've always loved wolves. I am intrigued by folklore and mythology from other cultures. I love fantasy. All of these things add to my love of this movie, and a dislike of them may detract from someone elses ability to like it quite as much. It is still a gem either way.

*Like all Miyazaki movies, close attention must be paid if you are going to understand and detract all of the subplots and subtle storyline details. Miyazaki puts forth the stories he sees in his head without apologies and without watering them down. Bless him.

*Hayao is clearly anti war and very disturbed by the defilement of nature. I won't discuss specifics here, but after watching all of his movies I can easily deduce at least a vague idea of his political ideals. I respect him but I do not agree with him %100. I enjoy this movie anyway for a couple of reasons: First, he does not devalue humans in this movie. For example Lady Eboshi is shown as cold, overzealous and sometimes cruel in her treatment of nature and the gods, but she is not doing it for power and money like the samurai. She does what she does for the people that depend on her. Eboshi is certainly an antagonist, but a very human one who is portrayed with apparent value and strengths. We are shown her generosity, her fearlessness, and her strength of will. Second, it is a fairy tale. Wolves are gods. Boars are gods. Monkeys are gods. Etc. If I lived in mythical Japan-from-the-past where wolves spoke and boars created clans, I would probably be a bad guy for trying to cut all of their throats too. Hayao is definitely making a point about humans and nature, but the fantasy and strength of characters make it a good movie regardless of differing man vs. nature opinions.

*There is violence in this movie, but it is PG-13. The first time I saw it was with my Grandma and she did a lot of ""ew""ing, so if you're an 8 year old or a sensitive granny you may want to stay away. (I am happy to report that my Grandma has since come to like this movie. Hurray!)

*The US dub is OK. Not great. I recommend watching the original Japanese version with subtitles.

*The animation is fantastic: Enchanting, vibrant, detailed, FANTASTIC.

I can not recommend this enough - or any Ghibli film period. Love, love, love!",1345852800,,2797,4.504930966469428
1321880,5,B00003CXBK,"When I came across this video I had major nostalgia, so I knew I had to order it. It played perfectly on my TV. No scratches; no damage at all. On top of that it shipped very quickly. I'll definitely be buying from here again! :)",1345680000,,229,4.0
1321881,5,B00003CXBK,"I love this movie! I love every single minute of it!! I make this statement because it is the truth. PRINCESS MONONOKE is absolutely the best film of 1999. Technically, it is a 1997 movie, but it was released in the U.S. two years later as part of the contract between Disney and Studio Ghibli. I missed the opportunity to catch it in theaters back in 99, but I got the chance to see it a year later on DVD.

All I knew at that time was that it was made by Hayao Miyazaki, who had only two previous films released in the U.S.: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. I heard stories about how his work is an inspiration to animators at both Disney and Pixar, and that he was a mentor to John Lasseter. I knew nothing about the story or the characters, and that was an advantage in this kind of a film.

I'll try not to reveal too much about the story. Set in ancient time when forests were ruled by gods, mankind has been doing terrible damage to the forests and have been angering the gods. When a boar god becomes a murderous demon and attacks a village a young boy named Ashitaka successfully defeats the demon, but at a terrible price. His right arm comes in contact with the demon and he is inflicted with a curse that will eventually kill him. He is the last of his tribe, and is told by the village's wise  woman to go on a journey to find a cure. Cutting his hair, he sets off on his journey, vowing to see the world without hate.

Ashitaka saves the life of two men  who live and work in a village known as Iron Town. The town is ruled by a woman named Lady Eboshi. Her people have been cutting down trees in order to manufacture Iron, and have been fighting with the gods with deadly weapons. A human girl named San who was raised by a wolf god has vowed to kill Lady Eboshi and has a deep hatred for all humans, including Ashitaka when he gets in the way of an attack she makes on Eboshi.

If this story seems rather oversimplified to you, believe me, it is not. In reality, there isn't really any clear line about who is good and who is evil in this film. Lady Eboshi isn't an evil character. She is a woman with some flawed motivation. She is actually seen as a good person to the people of Iron Town--someone who rescued young prostitutes and given them a much better working and living environment. Another character is Jigon: a man who is simply out to make money.

What Miyazaki demonstrates in this movie is that he creates characters that get your attention, and images that are just plain astonishing. He personally draws thousands of frames himself, which is something that most animation directors don't do. With PRINCESS MONONOKE, he does something that very few films, animated or not, are able to accomplish for me. He makes me forget that I'm watching a movie, and makes it feel like I'm actually in this movie. It's like an out of the body experience.

I cannot describe these amazing and really beautiful images that PRINCESS MONONOKE gives us. But I can reveal two things.  Many times during the movie there are scenes where you hear absolutely nothing on the soundtrack: no music, no dialogue, no special effects. The image will actually stop for several seconds, without any camera movement. Quiet scenes like this are so rare these days, especially in animated films. Miyazaki understands that not every scene has to have constant movement or quick cutting, like in most Hollywood action movies. PRINCESS MONONOKE does have several action scenes in it, but it is action that you can actually care about.

The other thing I can tell you about is the ending. There is a romance in the movie, but this isn't a romance where the hero gets the girl. It is actually one where the hero doesn't get the girl YET! Two of the characters love each other, but they understand that they cannot live together. When this movie ended, I had the sense that a real romance would actually come between them, but it would simply take time. How many movies, animated or not, have the courage to end that way?

There is another element in this wonderful movie. The music is by Miyazaki's longtime composer: Joe Hisashi. He has created a beautiful and mesmerizing score for this movie. It adds to the emotional power of the story and images, something so very few movies are able to accomplish.

PRINCESS MONONOKE was the film that sparked my interest in Hayao Miyazaki, and I currently own all of his movies on DVD. It also got me interested in other Japanese Anime. What the Japanese understand is that animation does not have to be pigeonholed as entertainment for children. PRINCESS MONONOKE has scenes that are dark and violent. It is rated PG-13, and I consider that rating appropriate. If there are still some children over 13 who still have the childlike wonder in them and haven't lost it due to the cinematic ADD that too many Hollywood movies generate, PRINCESS MONONOKE will be a real treasure.

The great filmmaker Howard Hawkes had a formula for defining a great movie: ""Three great scenes, no bad scenes."" Multiply that by three and you get PRINCESS MONONOKE.

note: Hayao Miyazaki made the best film for children that I've ever found: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. This should be the very first film children see in their lifetimes. If this review has sparked an interest in Miyazaki for you I also recommend a wonderful book about this man: HAYAO MIYAZAKI, MASTER OF JAPANESE ANIMATION by Helen McCarthy, which is available here at Amazon.com

UPDATE, 2015: PRINCESS MONONOKE has, at long last, been released on blu-ray. The best movie of 1999 just got better!!!!!! This blu-ray is absolutely gorgeous. And the new DTS 5.1 sound is just plain wonderful.",1345161600,,5677,4.557409224730128
1321882,4,B00003CXBK,"I used to really like this movie. I remember it as being a metaphor for how human beings have destroyed the environment and polluted it, instead of living in harmony with nature. But now that I watch it over, it seems Prince Ashitaka's only real concern is for San. His unwillingness to pick a side irritates me.

Anyways, creative movie, interesting. More spiritual and different than western animations. I recommend watching. Also, the best part of the film was the deer god/night walker - he is so cool!",1344643200,,506,4.75

1321962,4,B00003CXBK,"Another Ghibli anime film, so as usual it is very good. This one is a little different in that the 'treat nature well' message gets a touch murky with the human society development of industry on its hillsides. It will get destroyed, but rebuilt repeatedly like a virus that is left out to grow and spread. The reason is the need for each of us to 'wake up' and choose between private greed and the public's good. The two can be made as one with cooperation and insight and knowledge, but that is a rare thing indeed in our world ruled by the greedsters from WallStreet to MainStreet et al.

The greed aspect gets its ill gotten reward that destroys it all, but that greed is seen to return in the future and need be fought endlessly as long as such people remain on the scene. That is a touch of our reality I didn't expect to see in a typical Ghibli film. It also deals with the problems of women and those with diseases etc that get belittled, outcast or downtroddened. Ghibli always deals with the big picture and that is definitely found in this film.",1343692800,,1056,4.3604060913705585

1321966,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke has great animation, very good characters and storyline and a menagerie of wolves, pigs, apes, animal deities and miscellaneous monsters.  Sometimes it seemed that conjuring up weird wonders was more important than telling the story.

Were all those weird wonders really necessary?  Origins successfully tells the same type of eco story without the menagerie.  Princess Mononoke was quite capable of defending her forest without their help.  In fact, she would have come across as an even more heroic lass if she had been a solitary warrior.

I don't expect a story to be exactly the way I want it to be.  What the movie did do, it did very well.  For that reason I did decide to give it 5 stars instead of only 4, but I still like Origins better than Princess Mononoke.  If your preference in that type of story is to skip the menagerie, then Origins would be a better choice for you than Princess Mononoke.  Origins is also available from Amazon.",1340409600,,966,4.730538922155689
1321967,5,B00003CXBK,"This is an interesting film.  It's perhaps the most well known of all of Studio Ghibli's films in the U.S. and also Miyazaki's most mature, violent and serious film.  Thematically, it is most closely similar to his previous film, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which also dealt with heavy environmental themes.  Unlike Nausicaa, which I felt was very one-sided, Princess Mononoke is a much more fair presentation of both the human side and the forest.

The story follows Ashitaka, the prince of an obscure tribe of people who is cursed by a boar god-turned-demon.  He leaves the village to find the source of the boar god's curse, even though it's made clear that he doesn't have much hope of lifting his life-threatening curse.  From there, he discovers a war between the old forest gods and a settlement of iron workers...  What I really like about this film is that it presents a realistic portrayal of both sides.  Too often in environmentalist films humans are portrayed as pure evil and nature is always cute cuddly and good.  Princess Mononoke doesn't shy away from showing the vicious dangerous side of the forest and also both the good and bad points of the humans.  Lady Aboshi herself is both an antagonist who wants to destroy the forest to get the iron under it, but also a good person in her compassionate treatment of lepers and former brothel girls.  The film is sensitive enough in it's treatment of the issues that by the end you're not quite sure if either side is fully in the wrong.  That's the mark of a well-done story.

As for the visuals, as per Studio Ghibli expectations, they are excellent.  Everything is crisp, bright and beautiful, and all movement feels fluid and natural.  I especially like the depiction of the demon god, as it's quite appropriately icky-looking.  I also love the little forest spirits and their rattling heads - they're quite cute!  Anyway, the music also feels appropriate although I can't say I noticed it much.

Princess Mononoke is a film that any Studio Ghibli fan should see at least once.  Just be forewarned that it isn't as sweet and G-rated as most of Miyazaki's other films and definitely is not for kids.  If you're not a fan of Studio Ghibli, then I'm sure you could still appreciate this film as an excellent piece of animation!

P.S. - The 2000 DVD release comes with one special feature which is a little featurette with some interviews with the voice actors and other people who worked on the U.S. localization of the film.  It's pretty interesting stuff.",1339286400,,2529,4.726027397260274

Artistry/Animation:  9.99 out of 10.  I have seen a lot of anime, and to be honest this is the most impressively drawn and colored anime I've ever seen.  I don't give it 10 out of 10 because I don't believe anything is exactly perfect.  This is really close.  You can just tell that a lot of effort was spent on this movie.

Plot:  7 out of 10.  OK, so there are a LOT of moving parts in the film that tie together at the end, or I guess I should say competing interests between the different characters.  complexity does make for interesting watching, but you might be a bit confused the first time you watch it.

Music/SFX:  9 out of 10.  the music is awesome!  the sound effects are also really well done.  it says the sound is English 5.1, but I don't have a full surround system anymore so I can't tell.  The english translation actually makes sense, so I just watch it in english.  (ok you anime purists, get over it!  sometimes I like to actually SEE the movie instead of keeping my eyes glued to the subtitles at the bottom of the screen and watching the action with my peripheral vision.)

Length:  9 out of 10.  why did I put this in here?  because it's feature film length!  it's over 2 hours long, and a lot of feature films nowadays are less!  I really get depressed when I find a movie I like and it ends before I finish my popcorn ;) since anime is hand-drawn (for the most part), it tends to be shorter in length (the animators must get tired) and that bugs me sometimes (anyone else?).

I won't bore you with gushing restatements of the plot, just watch the movie!  I mentioned the things that are important to me and really stand out, even on the 5th viewing.

However, I can say that for people new to either anime or the Japanese culture, the themes present within this movie may be difficult to grasp and it may be better to introduce them to anime by some other movie or series first.

That said, the production value of this movie is terrific. I just finished watching it for third time and I can easily say it looks just as beautiful now in 2012 as it did when I first watched it years ago. It was the most expensive anime release of its time and it shows.

I won't comment on the English dubbing of the film since I only watch it in Japanese, and this is the way I would recommend everyone watch anime. There are so many nuances that get lost in the dubbing process. It doesn't matter what the origin language of a film is, it will ALWAYS be better than the dub. I have heard English-origin movies which were dubbed into Japanese and they're not as good as the English. I am not biased towards the Japanese language, I just think the original language the movie was made in is better and more believable in all aspects. Subtitles are not difficult to get used to. Within 10 minutes of the film you forget you are reading them.

All in all I would say that if you are a fan of anime or Japanese culture you should do yourself a favor and buy this movie. It is an important part of every anime collection.",1337040000,2,1417,4.2407407407407405

When compared with other Western animation from the same time period and more recently ""Princess Mononoke"" is far superior in design, quality, story, and music. No this isn't a film for small children, the violence and story would be difficult for them to understand, as I'm fairly certain it is difficult for many adults to comprehend due to the cultural/mythological themes used.

Directed by Hayao Miyazaki

Miramax | 1999 | 133 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Dec 19, 2000

The Film 4.5/5

Here's another film from Studio Ghibli that hasn't yet seen a Blu-ray release. If you read my recent review of My Neighbor Totoro, you'll know that I love Miyazaki's animation, themes and characterization. This film has a different feel to Totoro and is aimed at older audiences.

The story lasts 133 minutes and is quite violent in places. The opening scene shows a boar possessed by a demon, which is an immediate threat to a village. Ashitaka (Crudup) tackles the beast and ultimately kills it, but injures his right arm in the process. The arm is essentially possessed and the infection is expected to spread throughout his body, killing him. He's a danger to his own people and reluctantly has to leave in search of a cure.

Like most of Miyazaki's characters, Ashitaka is a good person. One clue to his character is the way he treats Yakul, the red elk that he rides. The two seem like partners and it's clear that he loves the animal.

Further clues to Ashitaka's character can be seen when he saves another village from attack and rescues two drowning men from a river. We see that his infected arm seems to have additional strength and that enemies hit by his arrows can be decapitated. As I mentioned at the outset, the film is aimed at older audiences than those targeted by Totoro. It's bloody and violent in places and death is always a possibility.

The first magical scene takes place in a forest. The locals fear it and the tree spirits that live there, but Ashitaka has no such fears. He sees the tree spirits as happy and childlike and willingly follows their directions. They lead him and the injured men to safety. He also catches a glimpse of the Forest Spirit, which is an altogether more powerful entity and has a big role to play in the story.

Ashitaka returns the men to their town and is thanked by the town's ruler, Lady Eboshi (Driver). She's one of the most interesting characters in the story. She's capable of giving people a chance where others wouldn't and has taken in prostitutes and lepers and given them honorable roles in her town. But she's also fiercely ambitious and thinks she's powerful enough to kill gods to gain more wealth and power. She's a truly divided woman, but not definitely good or evil. She does seem to genuinely want to help the people under her care and protection. Her character changes significantly by the end of the story.

Princess Mononoke has been raised by a wolf-god (Anderson) and regularly rides one of its two cubs. She hates humans because she only ever sees them harming the forest. Her character is wild and reckless and will attack the town in an attempt to stop the people causing further damage to her beloved forest. She feels that if she kills Lady Eboshi, the threat will cease to exist.

Miyazaki's animation doesn't look modern. It has the look of a watercolor painting and is simply drawn; but with simple drawings, he's capable of expressing a lot of emotion. When Ashitaka looks at his elk, the animal looks friendly, loving and intelligent. Its gaze and simple expression conveys all kinds of positive feelings. The forest is also a beautiful place and you'll find that you want to see it protected and unharmed. The tree sprites project joy and innocence and that innocence is a common theme in Miyazaki's work. I'm not sure how he does it, but it's powerful and moving.

The final act is full of action and a number of key characters suffer major wounds. It's not clear who will live and who will die, but not everyone survives. Some of the animals in the story are much more than dumb beasts and many are gods capable of mutual respect when they encounter souls who deserve it. There's a sense of that respect throughout the film and the characters live by their own honor code.

Miyazaki places us right in the middle of the action and commonly uses a panning technique as if the frames were filmed instead of drawn. He also takes his time establishing scenes and it's common to see water ripple, grass wave in the wind or clouds move across the sky. He seems to revel in the beauty of his worlds and I find that it helps me appreciate it all the more.

The conclusion of the story feels satisfying and right. It's not a contrived ending at all, but one which could actually happen given the personalities of the characters and their situation. It's interesting that Miyazaki's villains usually consist of misguided people rather than truly evil individuals. This is often the case in real life and it works better than having a stock villain like those found in most animated movies.

The actors do a good job in the English version, but the Japanese dub is included with English subtitles for anyone wishing to experience the original version.

I have only seen Princess Mononoke three times and found it a bit muddled the first time. It improved with each viewing and I now consider it just below Miyazaki's very best work. If you thought My Neighbor Totoro and Ponyo were too childish, give this a try.

Let's hope that a Blu-ray release isn't too far away.

1322202,5,B00003CXBK,"This is a great movie for any animated film lover.  Of course it is a bit more graphic than most ""family"" films, but not so much so that you can't enjoy it.",1306800000,,156,3.875
1322203,4,B00003CXBK,"We've all heard this story before.  As two sides are engaged in a fight to extermination, one individual from the winning side (us) travels to forbidden territory and experiences the lifestyles of the once-thought savage side (them), only to learn that it is, on the contrary, a lifestyle that must be preserved and worth fighting for, and henceforth decides to fight against the side of what he was once part.  Long story short: WE are the bad guys, not them; FEEL GUILTY!  Many films have done this including Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, the Last Samurai, and most recently, Avatar.

So what separates this film from the others?  It is the absence of the ""black and white""/""us vs. them"" mentality.  The other films completely sympathize with the losing side (usually the natives or nature), labeling them the good guys, and flat out label the other side as the villains (usually modern man or the white man).  This film tries not to do that.  The film clearly recognizes both the good and the bad on both sides.  What both sides fight for are BOTH selfish AND righteous at the same time.

On the human side, Lady Eboshi wants to protect her fellow humans, taking in lepers and the sick who would otherwise be killed in a world controlled by gods and demons.  Through her discovery of weaponized iron, she has found a way to fight back and rid the forest of the gods, giving her species a fighting chance.  On the side of nature, Princess Mononoke feels that the gods should remain in control of the world, in harmony, as it always has been.  Due to Lady Eboshi's actions, she is enraged and wants nothing more than to kill her.  She wants nothing more than the best for the plants and animals that have called the forest their home.  However, to do this nature must overcome its own hubris.

This is merely the tip of the iceberg.  Throughout the movie, both sides encounter more complex development, for example, Lady Eboshi's struggle with the war-bent samurai and Princess Mononoke's struggle with the other delusional, proud, and stubborn animal tribes.  This deepens both sides and makes both sides even grayer, completely removing the black and white morality.  In fact, the antagonist in the movie simply boils down to the anger and hate that dwells and grows on both sides like a curse.

So what are my gripes about this film?  Well, here are a couple.

The main character, Ashitaka, is so brave, so fearless, so pure, so valiant, so righteous, so... boring.  For a character that we follow through the entire movie, I feel he needed to have some more qualities that acted as flaws.  He does have his moments of anger when he loses control due to his curse, but these moments are rare.  Even so, he is easily able to overcome them.  By being such a near-perfect character, it was very difficult to relate to him.  A good main character is a flawed character that grows throughout the course of the movie, allowing the audience to grow alongside with him.

Another would be the length.  The movie is quite long.  It isn't a huge deal, but again, we follow Ashitaka throughout practically all of it.

Overall, this movie is great.  It's not perfect, but it's great.  It's not meant for kids, unlike other Ghibli films, but that doesn't hinder it whatsoever.  The soundtrack is superb, the animation is stellar and bright, and the plot is a great take on an old clich&eacute;d story.  The fact that it is ""anime"" is irrelevant; a good movie is a good movie.",1306195200,,3467,4.6650165016501655

1322207,5,B00003CXBK,"As always, Miyazaki delivers another masterpiece with Princess Mononoke. Set in 14th century Japan, it tells the story of a young prince named Ashitaka who must leave his people to find a cure for a curse he receives while defending his village from a boar-demon. He finds Iron Town and meets Lady Eboshi, a warrior women who runs the town and mines for iron. Her goal: to kill the forest god so no one will be able to stop her men from mining. Meanwhile, San (Princess Mononoke - who was raised by Moro the wolf god - is desperately trying to defend the forest from the humans who would try and destroy it.

There is no black and white villain in the story. The most likely candidate, Lady Eboshi, does try to kill the forest spirits, but also buys women out of brothels and gives them honest work. She also protects the lepers, those that would otherwise be complete outcasts with no way to support them. Although the story is set in the time of Japanese history that we normally romanticize (samurais, princesses in kimonos and emperors trying to avert assassination attempts, etc.) Miyazaki sets his story in a rural setting, where the emperor never appears in person, and samurais attack innocent villages. And of course, Miyazaki presents what is perhaps his most outright campaign for environmentalism. The forest he creates is large and wild, filled with gods and spirits that hate humans. However, to those that do not seek to harm the forest, the spirits can be fierce allies.

Overall, I would rate this as a very excellent movie. However, some parents might be concerned that there is too much violence and gore for their children. Yes, this is Miyazaki's most ""graphic"" movie, but it is limited to very specific scenes and emphasizes the point he is trying to make. War and progress often only result in the destruction of that which is most beautiful: nature and the human soul.",1304899200,,1892,4.712990936555891

Even as an adult, I found myself drawn to it, very epic and a good combination of action and fantasy.  A good purchase.",1304812800,,380,4.4
1322238,5,B00003CXBK,"A two-hour visual smorgasbord - there isn't much here that wouldn't look just fine framed and hanging on a gallery wall.  It is a complex and very nuanced plot, and one is grateful for Miyazaki avoiding the usual Manichean sanctimony of cartoon eco-propaganda in favor of characters who all seem to have more or less credible motivations for their actions.  They can be faulted for stupidity, but seldom for evil.

For once the English voice-overs capture the essence of the original but I still preferred it in Japanese with subtitles (I'm not fluent in Japanese but understand enough to notice that neither the voice-overs nor the subtitles are precise).  The voice acting in the original, the music, the pacing, the scenery, are possibly the best in the genre.  This is far, far superior to anything Disney has ever done.

There are some cultural references that are not necessary to understand what's going on but enrich the emotional impact of the film considerably.  When Ashitaka cuts his hair, for example, it means that he is leaving his home never to return.  Sumo wrestlers have a similar ceremony when they retire.  When his little sister, one of the people for whom he incurred the curse in protecting, gives him her dagger afterward she knows she'll never see him again.

It's a very Japanese treatment in other ways.  The underlying motivation of all of the main characters is loyalty: to family, to clan, to species, to uchi - this is ""home"" in Japanese but means a great deal more.  Ashitaka has had to give his up, which provides a tragic flavor to his character that is not resolved by an ending that brilliantly avoids closure.  Will he find it once more, either in Irontown or with the woman he loves?  We do not know, but there is hope.",1303776000,,1758,4.721311475409836

The characters are interesting and fun, some well-developed, some a little more mysterious.

This movie has drama, action, adventure, and is interesting enough for older audiences while still easily capturing the attention of younger audiences.

Once again we see a fight between good and evil, except here there is also a struggle to determine where everyone and each action stands as good or evil, neutral, necessary or not. It is also a battle between man, beast, nature, and the problems that arise when there is not harmony and balance.

There's just something about this movie that is very powerful. The meanings are both obvious and yet subtle and complicated. It's much more than a typical man vs. nature scenario, depicting an all too familiar greedy mankind and a seemingly fragile system. I could go on and on about it, but I actually wrote this for a different reason.

1322481,5,B00003CXBK,"To appreciate how exceptional 'Princess Mononoke' is, just try to imagine Disney doing something like this. Imagine how overbearing and preachy its message would be, or how sickly cute and perfect they would make San, or how the owner of the ironworks would be a ruthless, ugly, rich old guy. In contrast, `Mononoke' is a thought-provoking film that refuses to settle for easy answers, and contains very complex and well-drawn characters.

One thing to note is that this is quite adult-oriented compared to some Miyazaki films such as `Kiki' or `Totoro'. Although there's nothing gratuitous, there is a surprising amount of violence, and some mature themes. That apart, this film explores typical Miyazaki themes; including environmentalism, alternate history, Japanese mythology, and feminism. And like all Miyazaki films, `Mononoke' is superbly drawn and animated, incorporating some fairly subtle CG effects for the first time. In the original Japanese, the voice acting is universally excellent. (Although people have problems with some performances in the English dub, I can't comment as I always watch anime in its original language).

For the characterisation, the movie aggressively turns history on its head by having strong, capable women in powerful positions (even if Ashitaka is cast as the traditional `hero').  Lady Eboshi especially is a fascinating character, as she is a genuine antagonist. Her position puts her in direct conflict with Ashitaka and San not because she is evil, but simply because her needs clash with theirs. San herself is extremely aggressive for a heroine, and the various forest animals are even more ruthless and determined. The film constantly blurs the line between protagonist and antagonist; Eboshi destroys the forest but provides work and shelter for social outcasts, San and Moro defend the forest creatures but resort to violence to do so.  There is no `right' and `wrong' in this movie, just competing agendas. Such depth and thoughtfulness is welcome, and is one reason why I consider Japanese animation to be above its American counterpart.

If I had to make one criticism of this film, it's that there might be one too many competing agendas. We have Ashitaka and his quest, San, Eboshi and the ironworks, Moro and the wolves, the boars, the monkeys, the forest gods, Jigo, and the Emperor's mercenaries. There is an awful lot happening in this movie, and the various alliances and battles do require some concentration to follow. This alone means `Mononoke' is more suited to an adolescent/adult audience than for children. The pacing and storytelling is perfect, though, meaning the movie is not really difficult to fully appreciate or understand, provided you put in a little effort.

In my opinion, `Princess Mononoke' is Miyazaki's best film, and that's saying something. Outstanding animation, well-drawn characters, intricate plot, and some thought-provoking themes, all presented in a more mature and complex style. An amazing piece of work, and one of the best anime ever made.

1322484,5,B00003CXBK,Another compelling tale by Miyazaki. I always love his heroes because they relentlessly try to do the right thing. One word of caution is that this film is a bit darker than his others without much comedic relief/lightheartedness.,1255305600,,230,5.078947368421052
1322485,5,B00003CXBK,"First off, I have to say that I am not a big fan of anime, both movies and TV series. Most of them are incredibly over-the-top, some are just plain strange, a lot of them are style-over-substance, and many of them have characters that are WAY too sexual in terms of appearance. The plots themselves are odd to begin with; most of which are as bad as those that we find in more recent cartoons here in the United States. The craze that surrounds these anime films and shows are just wild; it's almost unbelievable. I do respect that other people love these forms of entertainment, but to me, anime is not, and has not been, my thing.

...Why are you rechecking my last name?...

Well anyway, there are some few animes that I really admire, and Princess Mononoke is one of them. This is one of the fewest animated films in which it's targeted at an older audience. It's not a family film: it has blood and no childish humor. It has a strong message: it focuses on humanity and how it's destroying the natural and spiritual side of the world. It is never over-the-top: no quick, colorful shots or strange techno music whatsoever. It's a classic in its genre, and it's Miyazaki's greatest creation, in my opinion. If you're tired of the Akira-like flashy lights, or lack of logic a la Bleach, or maybe even the Pokemon-like cuteness that you find in many children's anime, then Princess Mononoke can be the perfect alternative.

Mind you, though, that even though I see this as one of the greatest anime films ever created, it's not one of my top favorites. I did find the film a bit slow in some parts, and there were some moments about environmentalism that felt too preachy. And San was very annoying in some scenes. I just wished she could be quiet when the film goes on. But those are all the flaws that I can find, and they really are few. Princess Mononoke is, without any doubt whatsoever, one of the greatest animated films to ever come from Japan, and is one of the greatest in general. Kudos to Miyazaki for creating this gem.",1255132800,,2033,4.489189189189189

1322529,5,B00003CXBK,"As a relative neophyte to anime, I had assume the art form was limited to Pokemon and similar low-production value animation with similarly low-budget storylines. I was wrong. Oh, how I was wrong.

_Princess Mononoke_ is one of several ""anime"" films written and drawn by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a master of the art form. The characters are a long, long way away from the ridiculous ""cartoons"" I associated with anime - his are on a whole other level of detail and form. The storyline, as well, was much deeper and complex than I had given the genre credit for. The protagonists are not entirely ""good"", and the antagonists are not entirely ""evil"" - an honest representation of human nature, I thought - well beyond what I was expecting. The story's complexity furthered by the myriad themes: the costs of human greed, the price of environmental degridation, and the conflict of doing what is right for the individual versus what is for the greater good.

What was most surprizing, however, were the shinto overtones to the story in both character and in animation: the interplay of light and dark on characters, the relationship between ""spirit guardian"" and mankind, and the casting of a Buddhist monk as an antagonist.

I enjoyed the film tremendously, as did my 7 year-old daughter (for whom much of the subtleties were lost on, but who remained riveted by the masterful storytelling.) While _Princess Mononke_ is not my favorite Miyazaki film, it warrants 5 stars nonetheless.",1232150400,,1479,4.908

1322577,4,B00003CXBK,"I was a little unsure of what to expect from the title of this movie, but it certainly wasn't about a princess.  The plot of this film was very good.  I have yet to watch it with subtitles and I expect that it will be much better with them.  Billy Bob Thornton is terrible, plain and simple.  Minnie Driver seems out of place in her role as well.  Let's face it, the English voiceovers completely lack conviction.  At least some of the other anime films with English dubs that I have seen sound like they actually give a crap about what they are doing.  The main character, however was excellently voiced IMO.
As far as the plot goes, it is excellent.  You may want to read up on some Japanese tradition/legends before watching as most westerners brush off a plot about nature as hippie rubbish.  This film has a good message and should be embraced, with or without the crappy dubs.
The animation is top notch for the time period that it was released.  The opening scenes are some of my favorite and I am sure you'll see why.
All in all, the film is like a violent disney movie with an actual message that should be received by most kids 12 and older (unless you cottle your kids and could nag the paint off of the walls, in which case go and sit your kids down in front of Handy Manny or something while you wait for Sex and the City to come out on DVD (if you found that offensive, you know in your heart that it is true, so stop lying to yourself already!)).  I would not recommend this film to children that are any younger than this age due to the eerie violence that ensues at some unexpected parts.  Oh come on, just pay the 15 bucks and see it.  You probably won't regret it.  I didn't.",1214870400,2,1694,4.2367601246105915
1322578,5,B00003CXBK,"Studio Ghibli had been belting out movies since the early 1980s. They delt with everything from epic fantasy to coming of age films. But, nothing would have prepared the world for 'Princess Mononoke'. Not only is this film the 2nd highest grossing film in Japan, it is also the film that finally gave Studio Ghibili notice in the United States.

'Princess Mononoke' shows the epic battle of man against nature and how the constant motion of human evolution has the ability to destroy the purity of nature. Though there are no physical elements of good against evil the true villans in this film are greed, power and anger. You see characters like Asuyaka, who comes from a race of humans that have strong bonds with nature. Lady Hiboshi who wants to move the human race forward with science and technology only to create the perfect human utopia. Then you have Princess Mononoke, a girl who was tossed by her parents to the wolf gods out of fear, but only to be raised as a daughter of nature and learn the magic of the ancient ways. These characters clash for the purpose of moving forward, but also for the chance to co-exist. I feel that is what makes this film so appealing because of the similariteis in life. The topics of polotics, science and religion always cause a stir in us eventhough there can be ways to have them all work united.

This was a diffenent film for Miyazaki, but you still manage to see the magical elements that make his signature work. It is a film rich in detail and emotion. You get lost in the vast landscapes and the relationships of the characters you sometimes forget you are watching an animated film. Though this movie may not be for everyone because of the PG-13 rating for the epic battles and language, there are still elements that bring out Miyazaki's true colors and this film is a marvel worthy to be seen.",1214265600,,1850,4.569277108433735
1322579,5,B00003CXBK,"As a huge fan of Miyazaki's work, this was far from disappointing but truly worthy of praise. It excites the mind and the imagination with the story and captures a truly fascinating world unlike any other I've ever encountered in fantasy. It is beautifully animated even if in only 2-D, it is fluid and fanciful all the way through. However, concerning Miyazaki's other pieces, this one is more graffic and includes some more vicious demon work than other so-called demons in other pieces. Creatures and people are slaughtered or wounded and although blood doesn't gush, some might squirm. I felt a tad of revulsion, but not at the story itself. It thrills. It inspires. It's worth watching again and worth every penny. The dubbing is well done and I love it all.",1213747200,,763,4.787878787878788
1322620,5,B00003CXBK,"I owned this DVD for 8-10 months before i unwrapped and watched it--I didn'T like ""Spirited Away"" (you tell me why; I don't know). But I loved ""Grave of the Fireflies"" from the same studio, and ""Whiper of the Heart,"" which I think Miyazaki had a hand in.
Miyazaki takes the complexities of a simple problem (must the need for mechanization and what we make of natual resourses ruin nature?) and weaves a story of the most glorious creatures one has ever seen, imagined or not had the imagination to imagine. And although there is a hero and a heroine, nobody else is all good or all bad. I loved all the characetrs, from the girls rescued from a brothel to the (GULP!) Night Walker. Move over, Lawrence Olivier in Henry V (sorry; I was just thinking of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen).

There is a problem wih my DVD player, and I couldn't get the original soundtrack. I had no problems with the excellent actors in the English version (I think the Japanese are second only to Bergman in dubbing), but having read the reviews, I will watch it in japanese tomorrow at my friend's house.

LATER: The ENGLISH (dubbed) version is much better---because, first, the actors are all adequate to the task, but second, and more important, there is only so much subtitle you can fit on the screen at one time, and the subtitles to the Japanese version tend to be minimalist. The Japanese language is spoken rather quickly, and while the English-speaking actors could keep up, the subtitle-writers could not (besides, they have to take the reading speed of the audience into consideration as well).. (There have been movies where I have learned things from the subtitles that I hadn't even known were in the movies---this is NOT one of them!)You will learn a lot more of what's going on in the speech and thought of the characters--unless you know Japanese--if you watch the English language version.",1211241600,6,1897,4.693693693693693
1322621,5,B00003CXBK,"this movie is a classic. the animation is spectacular and the story very well done. I happen to be somewhat into japanese culture as of present, but before i was so into it, and people who i know now who are not into it, sometimes japanese media goes over their heads. the cultures are kind of different and place importance on different things and when a person used to seeing one kind of story or moral repeated over and over in different ways sees something else... well they may not immediately appreciate it (an example of this would be how at the end he doesn't end up with the girl. this happens in almost every western movie because we are very focused on the 'happy ending' fairytale, validating the storyline with the 'kiss at the end', but that doesn't happen in all cultures). however, i found princess mononoke to somewhat transcend this confusion, because the story is so relatable and well told. i found it to be so when i first watched it, which would be late elementary school, and feel this way even more now.

the story can be translated in many ways, but the general message i got out of it was the modern attempting to erase tradition. the people of iron town worked hard to destroy the forest because by doing so they could earn a living in the new world making iron. the only way they could do this however was to cut down the forests, which meant that they would have to kill the gods from the old world, who were already dying out. the thing is that the lady osono (or whatever) is painted in something of a bad light as she is cutting down the forest and killing the gods, but she is an amazingly strong humanist and a proactive woman in a time and place where women weren't liable to have that status (the status might help to paint her as a 'bad guy' however, because even though we are making progressions, many people are still very sexist... i would bet you that if not you yourself, someone you know thinks that women are by nature evil or devious... in 2008). So when looking at it in this light osono is opting for humanity. she takes in those lepers, she saves brothel workers from whatever fate they would face in brothels, etc. and yet she's the bad guy. interesting to note at any rate.

ashitaka is a great protagonist. a pacifist to the end. he goes on his journey to find something to remove his curse, not for selfish reasons i don't think, but to right the wrong. he's a pretty selfless person. at the beginning of the movie, the reason he got the curse was because his sister was in the way of the boar, so he had to shoot it, but before that he was trying to talk to it. this is basically how he acts throughout the movie. he tries to get things done without violence, but if it comes to it, he will resort to violence to protect himself or those he cares about.

 didn't really notice the environmental message when i first saw it. i was more focused on cultural loss. but recently, with the environmental bludgeon the media has been playing around with, i noticed just how 'for nature' this movie was. traditionalism would of course take the stance against industry which would be a way to save the forest, so it makes sense, but i guess i just went into it too symbolically. it does have a pleasant environmental message however, better than a lot of other animated environmental movies.

so, to sum up, this is a great movie.",1209859200,,3374,4.4006410256410255

And it's not. This story is about the struggle of nature against human civilization, and man against animal, animal against man. Its message is very real today.

Beside the underlying story, what really had me taken was the thought put into this tale - all these interesting things you might never think of. A  young girl raised by wolves (and she rides them!), and animal ""bosses"" or elders that are enormous compared to their followers (reminds me of typical video games where the boss is huge).

1322835,5,B00003CXBK,"I had only seen two works by Miyazaki prior to Princess Mononoke. I already knew that Studio Ghibli produced really terrific anime, and that Miyazaki had a knack for presenting film moments that make us sign in that part of us that senses wonder.

This film has, bar none other, one of the most enthrallingly magical sequences I have ever seen: the section in the heart of the forest where we see the forest spirit as NightWalker. These few cinematic moments were, to me as a Christian, almost holy. The film is of a different myth/religion, but it captures that ineffable, that transcendant, that wordless experience where part of you KNOWS that there is truth there, that there is something beyond atoms and molecules, and it is powerful and necessary and benevolent (although it can destroy, as we later see with the Forest Spirit). It is a moment that made me think of 60's psychedlia--a bit--and the special taste of clean night winds in moonlight--a bit--and the way you feel when you've prayed a powerful prayer.

You have to see it to understand. It's the combination of color, music, pacing, editing, expression, and the sheer otherness of this deity (I'm not Japanese, so the Forest Spirit, tree spirits, these things have a strangeness that was exhilirating.) I don't really know how to analyze properly how Miyazaki did it, but he captures a holy moment that transcends the story itself. Amazing.

Anyway, this site has numerous summaries of the plot. I'll spare you mine. I'll simply say that the outworking of this quest story, a story of man vs. nature, man vs himself, and the place of humanity within the natural context, is very powerful and extremely beautiful. Even dubbed, you will be captivated.

There is a moment near the end where there is this pause--many seconds passing when you wait, wait, wait and the screen seems not to change. And you find yourself hoping, praying for a change. And when the first perceptible changes come, it's such a relief. Such an answer to prayer.

This film is like an answer to prayer. It says things we need to listen to, and it can speak to folks outside of the Japanese culture and the nature religions. Good is sometimes supremely good here, and evil is...not always purely evil. Sometimes, it's just ignorant or selfish or unthinking...or somehow motivated by higher motives. And that shows a filmmaker with compassion and understanding of how people work. And of how the larger cosmos works, too.

I can't recommend it too strongly. A work of art.

Miyazaki doesn't make movies with simplistic 'Good vs. Evil' scenarios, but creates worlds filled with nuance and complexity.  The visuals are stunning, the characters are interesting, and the story rich and multi-layered.  A real joy to watch.",1168300800,,420,4.791666666666667
1322898,5,B00003CXBK,"In ancient Japan, a cursed prince travels to a land where men and the gods of nature struggle to define their positions in a newly emerging world order.  Exquisite animation is to be expected in a film by Hayao Miyazaki, and he does not disappoint here.  But this film also delivers his most profound moral statement in a story that does not feature simple heroes and villains.  The human drive to control the environment and improve the quality of life, in the form of Lady Eboshi's ironworks, upsets the balance of nature, but there is more to her than that.  The lepers who make her rifles are grateful for the good treatment they receive from her, and the workers in her factory are prostitutes that she has rescued from the brothels.  Her desire to slay the gods of the forest with her rifles and iron bullets is a potent metaphor for man's drive to conquer nature with technology.  The creatures of the forest are not simplistic good guys, either.  They can be violent and are in danger of being transformed into demons by their rage.  This complex film is a joy to watch and has the power of myth.",1168041600,,1104,4.5125628140703515

1322900,4,B00003CXBK,"This is another beautiful animated adventure by Hayao Miyazaki. Cons: I gave it four stars because it if definitely not for little eyes-heed the PG13 rating.  Princess Mononoke has a lot of bad language, violence, gore, and many adult themes-like the fact that the fighting girls come from a brothel.  When my 10 year old asked what that was, I realized this movie is for grown-ups.  It was not Hayao's usual adventure that brings a child far away into his or her imagination, and brings a grown person like me back to my childhood.  This film is dark and tortures the soul with a theme of humans once again killing what is innocent and beautiful for selfish reasons. Now for the Pros:  Hayao Miyazaki is a genius once again with his characters, animation, and theme.  Princess Mononoke is going to pull you in and make you fight for whichever side you choose, and not let you go until the very end.  Excellent for grown-ups who want to 'escape' the real world for a while, join forces with Hayao's good Asitaka & Mononoke or the evil Lady Eboshi characters, and fight for what they believe in.

1322901,5,B00003CXBK,"""Princess"" is among the absolute best anime to come along, in the last 15 years, and arguable, one of writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's best, as well. The visuals and writing are imaginative, original, realistic. Female characters are predominately featured here as in several other of Miyazaki's films, which I highly recommend (Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Nausica of the Valley of the Wind).  I feel that his work is art that takes me to that sublime nether world where one can truly see with ""eyes unclouded by hate, mediocrity, or status quo"". I screened this movie during lunch breaks, at my job, for co-workers. It was well received by most who couldn't recall seeing anything like it before.",1162512000,3,705,5.0256410256410255
1322902,5,B00003CXBK,"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war. The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards. The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance. But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance. The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy. The story is not easy to understand. It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.

The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore. And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.

The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted. Japanese television documented a lot of the production. The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.

If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work). Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that. His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute. There is no other animation like it. This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",1161129600,4,2705,4.6078838174273855

With complexity, excellent role models and very solid messages of environmental awareness and moral character, this movie is among Miyazaki's best...and I love almost everything he has done. Miyazaki is one of the best modern storytellers in any culture and this is a wonderful story.

The dubbing is a bit sluggish at times, but I am just always happy when dubbing WORKS since I saw the original, terrible dubbing of Nausicaa. The dubbing does work in this even if my preference is still subtitled.",1150070400,,591,4.91
1322949,5,B00003CXBK,"I wouldn't go so far as the New York Post in calling this film ""the 'Star Wars' of animated features,"" but certainly Princess Mononoke is a vibrant, magical movie that resonates with life in all its facets and the spirit that lies beneath this world we too often take for granted.  It's funny how American animated films are always about - well, nothing at all, really, while Japanimation is about basically everything.  To me, dubbing this film into English, no matter how talented and famous the voice actors are, just feels wrong.  Certainly, it helps attract a Western audience that has still only begun to discover the wonders of anime and makes the story much easier for younger viewers to understand, but anime purists will probably want to watch the film as it was originally intended to be shown - and, fortunately, it is possible to change the setup to play the movie in Japanese with English captioning.  Speaking of younger viewers, the film does deserve its PG-13 rating, as more than a few characters lose their heads - literally - and animals are slaughtered in significant numbers during several scenes of fighting and warfare.

Princess Mononoke is not so much the story of the princess herself as it is of young Ashitaki, a young warrior who journeys many miles westward in search of a cure for the demon curse transferred unto him by a giant boar demon he managed to kill when it attacked his village.  The odds of him finding and being healed by the Spirit of the Forest are pretty low, making this as much of a spiritual journey as a physical one with a clear purpose.  He and his noble elk steed do find the place, however, after a brief sojourn in Iron Town.  The humans in this fortified village have been clearing away forest so that they can mine the iron ore that exists within the soil in great abundance.  For her part, Lady Eboshi is working to perfect the guns she will use to defend Iron Town from those casting greedy eyes upon it even as she plots with hunters sent by the emperor to slay the Spirit of the Forest himself.  The animal gods of the forest, seeing the human threat now close to destroying their final peaceful retreat, gird up for battle themselves, particularly the boars and the wolves.  Among the wolves is Princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves; she hates all humans for their greedy, destructive ways - a fact which rather complicates the personal bond she eventually comes to share with Ashitaki.

It's a rather complicated story, really, but it all culminates with the seemingly unavoidable armed clash of men, gods, and animals - a war that Ashitaki desperately tried to prevent.  Already dying from the demon curse, Ashitaki, a warrior hero with sympathies for both sides of the fight, risks all in an effort to save both the princess and the Spirit of the Forest himself.  You can never take anything for granted in Japanese anime, particularly in terms of who lives and who dies, and this makes the final moments of the film all the more captivating - not to mention poignant.  In a war that can have no true winners, what of the world will be left for those who manage to survive?

The animation (which is from 1997) is not all that breath-taking on the face of things; at first, I really couldn't see why it is praised so highly.  As you get into the story, however, and see the absolute importance of nature, as represented in the animation, you quietly become more and more impressed.  The scenes with the little forest sprites are especially magical - they are most unusual creatures, really quite simple in terms of their animated form, but they prove magical indeed as representatives of the forest and the beauty of nature.  The Spirit of the Forest is equally engaging, and much more impressive and majestic in each of his forms.  All of the characters are quite expressive, in fact, revealing as much through the animation as they do with their voices.  That is one reason the movie works so well even with English dubbing.

If you've yet to experience anime, I can't think of a better introduction than Princess Mononoke.  With the English dubbing, the viewer is free to take in the whole animated experience (something that would take a second viewing for a movie with subtitles) and see just what makes Japanese animation superior to anything you'll ever see come out of Hollywood.  Hayao Miyazaki didn't make a film, he created a vibrant new universe that will transport viewers back to a medieval age when iron was new and animals still ruled the forests.  Not content to merely entertain, the film addresses a number of questions that get right to the heart of human life itself, touching on themes of love, hate, honesty, community, heroism, selflessness, life, death, stewardship of the Earth, etc.  With only a short featurette and a theatrical trailer, the DVD doesn't have much in the way of special features, but the movie alone more than makes Princess Mononoke worth the price of admission, rental, or purchase.  Don't forget: until Titanic squeaked by it, this was the top-grossing film (and still remains the top-grossing domestic film) in Japanese history.",1149897600,,5152,4.733780760626399

From the man they call the master

And from the time I ordered it

I'd wanted it much faster

A demon rages through the wood

A god under a curse

Ashitaka slays the beast

But then things get much worse

Before the boar god, Nago, dies

He grabs the prince's arm

The mark brings hatred and much pain

To everyone's alarm

He leaves his home to find a cure

And see what ails the west

Only with unclouded eyes

Can he fulfill his quest

He meets a monk who points the way,

The way to Irontown

And as the name implies to us

It's where they melt ore down

He comes across a battle scene

That raged from hills above

And though her lips are red with blood

He lays eyes on his love

Princess Mononoke was she

A girl raised in the wild

&#8220;The Princess of the Spirits&#8221;

Was the name they called this child

At Irontown he's soon to learn

The cause for all the pain

For Eboshi's people to survive

The forest feels the strain

Two strong women with a cause

He tries to bring a truce

But each woman is sure she's right

And his efforts are no use

The Princess saves the Prince's life

And takes him to a pond

Where Shishigami, Forest God

Brings him back from beyond

A mighty battle soon ensues

It's human versus god

Boars and demons, men with guns

Leading to blood-soaked sod

This lengthy tale seeks to suggest

That if men make compromises,

And let the Forest Spirit thrive

We'd enjoy more sunrises

1323013,5,B00003CXBK,"I'm a pretty tough critic of movies, and even with my favorite movies I can always find some flaw. In this masterpiece however, I was utterly awestruck with the sheer beauty of everything. The amount of detail in the animation and the amount of depth to the story is something that, unfortunately, Hollywood could never hope to produce. This brilliant movie is an exhilerating journey from start frame to ending credits, incorporating themes of the never-ending conflict between man and nature, how there are no true bad guys or good guys, how one can still live and find happiness when they are cursed, and how the only cure for hate is true love. This is a story that has to be watched with a purely open mind, with eyes unclouded by hate as they say, to truely appreciate it. An A+ job by the master of animation, Hayao Miazaki. Understand that this movie is better left for people with the maturity to see the movie as a whole, for what it is, and as such, it's not exactly a feature film for children under the age of 12. The themes that make it hard for a young person to absorb is precicely what makes it such a breathtaking creation in the first place. Leave movies like 'Finding Nemo' and 'Chicken Little' to the kids, where they belong. 'Finding Nemo' is kids stuff. This is art.",1145404800,4,1289,4.48936170212766

1323016,5,B00003CXBK,"Like the most recent entries I to first saw Mononoke on Cartoon network last saturday. I had already owned Spirited Away (seeing that also for the first time on cn about a month ago) and I thought I would give it a shot after seeing on the sa Dvd that mononoke was supposed to be better. Well it did not lie. I had the movie recorded on vhs but I rather own the movies instead of having choppy commercails in them. I plan to see the last two movies before I buy them but I'll tell you one thing mononoke is already in my shopping cart. (though I can't affrod to ask my dad to buy it yet after just buying spirited away)
AS for the descripition I'm not one for gooy romance sort of films I'd rather have romance be the frosting or sprinkles to any good movie or book. Mononoke is just my type I love action and adventure stuff (my friends find it weird seeing as I'm a girl and should simply love romantic movies. four words yuck, way to mushy). Miyazaki is a pure genious!
Mononoke is about a boy who is attaked by a demon and gets fataly cursed. he heds west to try and find the spirit of the forest and beg it to lift the curse. That is basicly the jist of it with alot more details but you'll have to watch it.
What's ironic is that as far as I can tell the name Princess Mononoke is only metioned once. the rest of the time she is called san (though how you spell it I have no idea).
Over all this movie, though bloody hence pg-13, it has to be the best animated film I have ever seen. I will say once again Miyazaki is a genius.

You've got to buy this I know I am.

Saw 1+2, Jeepers Creepers, Boogeyman, etc. (I am not a horror movie fan so i don't know many), and those hollywood gauranteed-to-make-you-scream movies can top this? Liar. Also, there really isn't too much and when there is it is tasteful, not massaive amounts everywhere just for effect. Again, There were beheadings in early Nihon (Japan) and elsewhere in the world so don't be so shocked. 3) If you are too thick to understand the stroy just don't leave a review.

The main character in the film stands as a middle figure who has no ill will towards either side and seeks to bring the two into at least a truce. The images are stunning, and the sheer imagination necessary to create this magical world is breathtaking at times. The complexity of the problem is dealt with in a very balanced way, without demonizing one side or the other.

'cause if you think Mononoke-hime is violent and bloody you'll have to be committed after pissing in your pants and balling your eyes out till there's not a drop of water left in your body when you watch the other classic anime i've listed. all in all, wonderful movie: animation, character development and depth, plot (if you can't understand it you're probably too young to watch it or have come in with an already biased opinion), music, Japanese language track. the only place this DVD is lacking is the English language track, as others have stated. frankly, Claire Danes was absolutely awful as San. it brings sorrowful tears to my eyes, and gut-wrenching sickness to my stomach whenever i watch it in English (which, now, is absolutely never). the American actors completely butchered their rolls. with Claire Danes' odd, can't-put-your-finger-on-it, not-quite-right, horrid performance; Billy Bob Thornton and Billy Crudup's flat and wooden voice ""acting""; and Gillian Anderson sounding like she's got cotton stuffed in her cheeks. which, i'm guessing, she does. oh and Minnie Driver who is apparently quite forgettable as Eboshi-sama. i love this movie. it was one of *THE* movies that helped propel my interest in anime in leaps and bounds. just watch it in English once so you can take in the full beauty of it and then forget the English language track exists and stick to the flowing beauty that is the Japanese language.

PS of course it's not for kids you freakin' morons! did you even pay attention to the rating before you showed it to your young children!? you're the reason that movies and video games get so much crap. because you take your young children to see movies and let them play video games that are clearly not meant for young children! and then you try to hide your own stupidity by blaming it on the movie and video game industry and complaining to the FCC. when there is plenty of warning and advisement against your own moronic actions and poor parenting. sorry to be so harsh, but you all know it's true. though i watched violent, R rated movies when i was a young child and i turned out TV.... um, OK. i may be a little desensitized to *FAKE* movie-magic manufactured violence and gore, you can be sure i wouldn't feel so fine if i saw the same things in real life that i've seen in movies. i'd probably puke my guts out. but other than that i'm a more or less well-rounded citizen. movies that seemed to scare many other children, i quite enjoyed and movies that i shouldn't even have been watching and probably should've sent my little mind into a torrent of insanity i sat and merely enjoyed at face-value until i was old enough to fully understand it. you're probably the ones who think The Nightmare Before Christmas is a sick and twisted, demonic, and satanic movie that no sane parent should ever show their child. well guess what! that's one of my all time favorite movies. and i probably first saw it when i was around the age of 7! i absolutely loved it! didn't have one dream *OR* nightmare about it. the two *children's* movies i remember having nightmares about are The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. though i did (and still do) like Willy Wonka. not the new one though. anywho, i'll step off my soapbox rant now. thank you. love the movie!",1139097600,2,4081,4.552380952380952

But my point is I'm not rating this movie according to the message it's trying to send out. I'm rating it according to what I thought of the story, the voice performance, and character development, all of which I thought were superb.

There are also those who would call this a silly childish plot, and to that I deny. The fact that there are talking animals is completely irrelevant. The plot revolves around a situation of warring civilizations and the extermination of races. Not exactly the kind of tape you pop in for the kids. 800-page fantasy novels have been written involving animals blessed with human qualities and millions of ADULTS read them, I mean don't be ridiculous calling this a kid's plot.

1323146,5,B00003CXBK,"Hayao MIYAZAKI's ""Princess Mononoke"" is the third anime film I've seen, the second I've liked, and the first that really blew me away.  The grand story, lush visuals, attention to detail, enchanting soundtrack and sophisticated characterizations all combine to make ""Princess Mononoke"" a truly captivating film.  Miyazaki's (largely hand-drawn) artwork is famous, and far superior to any other animation I've ever seen.  Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack perfectly complements the epic artwork, pacing and tension of the film.  It is composed largely within the western symphonic tradition; its majestic yet melancholy tone strongly reminds me of the slow theme of Holst's ""Jupiter"".  The characters, wonderfully, are all human (even the nonhumans) in the sense that their motivations are rational and logical.  There are no true villains, only characters driven into conflict by their opposing goals, ideals and loyalties.

Despite American prejudices about cartoons as kid stuff, ""Princess Mononoke"" is targeted toward older audiences: it is long, its plot is complex, and there is a good deal of ""blood and gore and guts"", though the film does not revel in the violence.  I'm not terribly fond of the English-language dub of the film, but it is decent by the standards of the genre.  Fortunately this DVD includes both language tracks so you can compare them and choose your favorite.

""Princess Mononoke"" is set in Japan's medieval period, after the country's feudal system has broken down and the power of the Emperor and the Shogun is all but nonexistent.  The film follows Ashitaka (""tomorrow?"" in Japanese), the last prince of a group of 'barbarians' hidden in northern Japan (a draft title of the film was actually ""The Tale of Ashitaka"").  He is cast out by his people after being cursed by a demon, and travels to the demon's home at the other end of the land in search of a way to remove the curse.  There he finds himself in the middle of a war for control of an ancient forest, fought between the people of Iron Town, led by the able, determined, humane and iconoclastic Lady Eboshi, and the gods of the forest (mononoke), in whose ranks fights San, the Princess Mononoke of the title, a human girl raised by the wolf god Moro.  Falling in love with San and learning that it was the hatred of this war that took shape as his curse, Ashitaka desperately but unsuccessfully tries to make peace between the humans and the raging gods, before they destroy each other and him with them.

There are two main themes Miyazaki addresses in ""Princess Mononoke"". The first has to do with Japanese history.  Miyazaki is an admirer of popular Japanese historian Yosihiko AMINO, and several of Amino's arguments are reflected in ""Princess Mononoke"".  For example, Miyazaki attempts to avoid the focus on rice-farming peasants and Samurai warriors typical of Japanese films set in the medieval period (such as Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"").  Instead, he concentrates on manufacturers and traders, hunters, monks and other non-agriculturalists, whom Amino argues are often overlooked in traditional histories of Japan.  In addition, Miyazaki tries to illustrate the chaos, confusion and rapid social and cultural change that Amino sees at the heart of the medieval period, and that Miyazaki views as similar in many ways to the present, with its rapid changes in technologies, cultures and ideas.

Second and more visible is the issue of humanity's relationship with nature.  Although many western viewers have been quick to categorize ""Princess Mononoke"" as a simple eco-fable or environmentalist screed, it should really go without saying that Miyazaki's environmental message is far more subtle.

In a sense, ""Princess Mononoke"" can be considered the spiritual sequel to Miyazaki's 1984 film ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", which also focused heavily (and more ideologically) on ecological issues.  ""Princess Mononoke"" was, in fact, the first film Miyazaki made after finishing his nearly 1100 page ""Nausicaa"" novel in 1994, after a dozen years of work. (""Nausicaa"" the film roughly covers around the first quarter of ""Nausicaa"" the novel, with certain changes to give it an ending.)  However, those years saw the slow but irreversible death of Miyazaki's early socialist idealism, which informed the simpler message of the film version of ""Nausicaa"".  While that film was dedicated to the hope that with proper determination and enlightenment humankind could learn to live in peace with itself and with nature, Miyazaki's message in Princess Mononoke is (in his own words) that ""There can not be a happy ending to the fight between the raging gods and humans.""  This is a fight that has already begun, that is in fact inevitable.

But Miyazaki has more to say: ""We are not trying to solve the global problems.  There can not be a happy ending to the fight between the raging gods and humans.  However, even in the middle of hatred and killings, there are things worth living for.  A wonderful meeting, or a beautiful thing can exist.""  ""Princess Mononoke"" is a beautiful thing, a credit to Miyazaki's vision, skill and dedication.",1137542400,2,5128,5.112709832134293

1323148,3,B00003CXBK,While Princess Mononoke was in itself a very well done movie the English dubbing is well...how do I put this...terrible.  People should learn that using real life actors in voice over talent is a recipe for disaster.  Billy Bob Thornton comes off as being a flat and emotionless persona in the movie.  While Claire Danes and Minnie Driver do carry out their roles admirably they are far from the grade of talent that exists for this kind of work.  In relation to the gore of the movie I must say that this criticism is ill founded.  I mean to say when one gets his/her arm cut off or their head for that matter and their is absolutely no blood there is an issue.  In short turn off the English dub and watch it in the original Japanese for a better experience.,1134864000,5,760,4.3546099290780145

Do I want to see anime, but not kiddish anime?

Am I at least mildly interested in the conflict between human interests and the preservation of nature?

Do I question the validity of at least some war?

Can I appreciate artful animation?

Do I want to be able to accept anime as real movies and not silly cuteness?

I have a brief question to ask all the people who  say this movie is too long. Do you think that all movies that are over 2 and 1/2 hours are too long, or just this one?

2.

 To parents who say this movie is not for kids remember that it gets a PG 13 rating (That means 13 and over only) and that you should be screening your kids movies before they watch anyway. (Thats part of the being a good parent thing)

3.

Many reviewers list the Violence as a negative aspect of this film and yet they list better films to watch wich have more violence or questionable themes. The violence is akin to Lord of the Rings and not akin to Rambo.

4.

The music fits the movie well and changins with the tone and theme when it is required but sometimes I thought it was a bit repetative.

Character development is excelent. Humans rarely change over time so why should we expect movie characters to do the same.

We turned on the American voice-over version (with Minnie Driver (what the heck?) and the like), and my friends started laughing at it from the very beginning.  We then played, I think it was the American subtitles with Japanese voice, and I was told that the words on the screen did not at all match the words being said.  Finally, we settled on the literal English subtitles.  This translation seemed to be the closest to what was actually being said.  When we were done watching the film, we watched the American previews.  I was shocked when, was it Claire Danes or Minnie Driver, described the movie as heartwarming and being about friendship and love.  HA! No wonder parents thought it was a kids movie.  This film is an adult movie, not for kids.  The themes are much more suitable for young adults.  In the literal English version, you see everyone in the story, yes, even animals and trees as being responsible for the state of things in the world.  You see a shocking portrayal of the ""circle of life"" as it were.  The story is not supposed to be resolved by the end, it's supposed to show that life goes on, that there are conflicts in this world that will just continue to transform and that there's only so much one can do.

1323296,5,B00003CXBK,"Hayao Miyazaki has created a film that places among the best I have ever seen, and I am not limiting my comparison to the anime genre. The director presents the fight of good vs. evil not only through different characters, but also related to the conflict in one of the main characters (Ashitaka). The concept is similar to the one used in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but in this film Ashitaka is still trying to contain the inner demon and prevent it from coming out.

Right from the start we are mesmerized by the beautiful colors and animation, with crisp drawings and scenes of bliss. Miyazaki is very crafty in using this tool, together with well-chosen music to depict the mood of each scene. But happiness has an end, and in this case, the small village that was portrayed so lively, is attacked by a demon from the forest. Ashitaka is in place and tries to stop this demon before it reaches the village, being partly successful in his attempt. He gets to destroy the demon before he can kill all of his loved ones, but he also touches it in the process. This means that now he is doomed to be overtaken by the evil spirits and die an awful death.

This sense of fatality is not unknown in the epic anime genre, and usually we get to see the main characters go on a quest that is impossible to achieve. This case is not different, and even though the Oracle tells Ashitaka that he cannot change his fate, she mentions that there may be an alternative by going west and facing the calamity of Mikado (evil demon) to lift the curse. So Ashitaka leaves the village knowing he should never return.

That is when the classic epic adventure starts, and we go on a journey through a forest full of fantastic creatures, gods and demons. One of these ""creatures"" is no other than Princess Mononoke, a young girl whose soul the wolf stole, and who has vowed to kill the wolf's enemy, Lady Eboshi. The relationship that develops between Ashitaka and Mononoke is a complex one, and Miyazaki uses the disturbed nature of these characters masterfully to make the story even more interesting.

When you put together a great story, with impeccable animation, appropriate music that complements the action perfectly and a few surprises here and there, the result is a movie that is top notch. Therefore, the only thing left to say is that I highly recommend this film, it is a must see!",1119312000,8,2373,4.537383177570093
1323297,5,B00003CXBK,"I have had the privilege of seeing Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" and ""Castle in the Sky"" prior to ""Princess Mononoke"", and so far all of them stand up to his legendary status. There is not a single of his movies that I've seen so far, much less a moment through any of them, that you could do away with and criticize for being unnecessary.

The story of ""Princess Mononoke"" gets you hooked within minutes, with animation and music that make you forget that you are not watching a live feature. The result of some of the landscape shots to the score by Joe Hisaishi result breathtaking and the voiceover of some extraordinary North American talent (Billy Bob Thornton, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, etc.) makes the movie stand out even more, further helping bridge a cultural gap that was unthinkable to overcome years ago.

In a nutshell, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a movie both you and your children will enjoy. It leaves you with a very powerful message about the struggle between the human race and nature, and how our ""progress"" has gradually done away with entire forests, resulting in animals loosing their homes and us loosing the benefits trees bring about. It is more than just an environmental message. It questions our motivations and puts things in perspective, showing how even those with the best intentions can eventually do wrong, causing harm to others. In short, check it out.

In Spirited Away, there's a character(Haku) and another one. Their loved ones get into trouble so she/he has to save them. Miyazaki's films go tward one direction. Love and heroic action. Princess mononoke and Spirited away has both but, something about Princess Mononoke that is even better than Spirited Away. Princess Mononoke has the adventure all teens like me would like.

The animation is quality, with beautifully detailed backgrounds.  The plot is unique and very original; Miyazaki's emphasis on nature as a character is new to Americans, but the story is very good and will hold your attention all the way through.

 I have had difficulty getting into anime in the past, but Miyazaki's quality level is so high it makes his movies a pretty safe bet for anyone.  One other thing, although there is no profanity or nudity in this film, it is probably not suitable for very young children; there are some battle scenes where people get limbs cut off.  The battles are part of the plot and thus the violence is not gratuitous, but none the less you might wait until your kids are a little older to let them watch it.",1118966400,2,904,4.54320987654321

At times I've seen some great ones, like Sprited Away, and then gone out looking for more and been disappointed with a lot of silliness. This film, though, is another great version of Japanese anime for an adultish audience. This is not for small kids. It's complex, at times gruesome, and much of the imagery and lore will be very unfamiliar to Western audiences. But that's what's so wonderful about it for the right audience. It's fantasy from an entirely different perspective, with spirits and talking animals and demons. There's also quite an anti-industrialization and pro-environmentalist message to this. Maybe none of the ingredients by themselves explain why this is so different and unusual. I think, really, it's that in the Western World so much of our reference points for fantasy come from Tolkein, CS Lewis, etc - writers who wrote inspired by an Anglo tradition. So we're use to certain types of wizards, obvious good and bad guys, heroic behaviour of a certain type. But with Japanese anime all bets are off. The reference points are entirely different, based in a different mythology. Viewers need to open their minds and just enjoy the wonder of a different worldview on fantasy.

Although I'd have to say I don't agree with people that say this is Hayao Miyazaki's best work, and I've seen every one of his movies except Nausicaa. I think the gore, violence, and blood make this movie pretty disturbing and I think the world of movies should make a rating in between PG-13 and R and put Princess Mononoke in that catagory. I'm 13 and wasn't too impressed. I have some friends who are 13 and would find this movie VERY disturbing. It's not bad enough for R but I think you should be cautious with teens under 15. Now don't get me wrong, it WAS a good movie, and I LOVE anime, but I just had a little trouble getting past the gore and blood.

I loved this movie and watched it six times. The characters were well represented and the storyline is very interesting. However I thought the name ""princess mononoke"" was kind of corny because it only appears once in the whole show and was probably just used to give it a good and attractive title. this movie is very interesting and good anime, and i would highly recommend it to anyone, although the bloody scenes may not be great for little kids.",1113696000,4,626,4.598214285714286

This is important, as I wasn't.  No way could you to get me to believe in Animes. Then I watched Princess Mononoke!  It was over after that. I could not believe the style, sound, color, dub, and, most importantly for Animes, the plot.  Everyone I show it to loves it.  Even when I was watching it on my PC on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam, the Stewardes and passengers stopped to ask what it was.  Princess Mononoke is the highest standard in movie length Anime, even better than the excellent Oscar winning ""Spirited Away"" by the same director.  If you want to find out if you like anime get this movie.  Then, if you do, go on to the other anime series I found to be wonderful, such as ""Trigun"" ""Tenchi"" ""Full Medal Panic"" and ""GXP.""

The movie is essentially about a man who kills a demon but gets infected by it.  In his search to find where the demon originated, he becomes caught between two different worlds-nature's struggle against man, and the society where the people are good but are hurting the environment.

Actually, for the movie to be called Princess Mononoke is a little strange, she's the secondary major character.  It's more about the young man.  Overall it was a good movie.

PG-13 means that it's for people aged 13 and above. It is implied that people of those ages are mature enough to understand and handle the content within. It's NOT FOR JUNIOR. Don't blame whoever decided on the rating for your inattentiveness.

Also, do the words ""fairy tale"" or ""myth"" mean anything to you?

If you have a young child into anime, try lighter fare like some of the things shown on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, dubbed Sailor Moon, or Code LYOKO.

For folks still hanging around, there's lush visuals, beautiful audio, and decent voiceacting to be enjoyed (headphones!), as well as a wonderful story told through those mediums. Wolves, apes, cute little rattle-head thingies, and boars abound, some playing pivotal roles. Bonds of trust and loyalty are shown. There is love, hate, and compassion all woven in.

1323432,5,B00003CXBK,"One of the darkest and most intense Studio Ghibli masterpieces, ""Princess Mononoke"" is every bit as vast and grand as ""Lord Of The Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and rivals fellow Ghibli fare like ""Castle In the Sky"" and ""Spirited Away"" in memorabilty and array of character (both human and nonhuman), creature and concept.  The film's character cast is headed by Mononoke, a wolf-raised girl involved in the resistance of animals and nature against the ever-encroaching and ever-dominating human civilization, and Ashitaka, afflicted with a life-draining malady and on a quest deep into the remaining forest to find the elusive cure.  Being a Miyazaki-directed feature, ""Princess Mononoke"" still manages to easily blend in large amounts of beauty, cuteness and charm into the darkly serious and often violent story of conflict.  The struggle between relentless human industrialization & expansion and the vanishing natural world is a common theme in many Ghibli movies, but seldom presented in such a warlike and apocalyptic fashion.  Interestingly, it does this without demonizing the encroaching human factions.  As in our world, in this admittedly less technologically advanced world, the enivirornmental decimation isn't always caused by a burning malicious desire to eradicate our planetmates, but out of - what?  Arrogance?  Honest ignorance?  Unconscious apathy?  A defeatist attitude that it's all going to be plowed over anyway so why bother trying to delay the inevitable?  Unfortunately, it's the other 99.999% of species that have to suffer the bulk of the consequences.  In ""Princess Mononoke"", the 99.999% are in the early stages of not taking things lying down anymore, and are being aided by some very powerful entities, and the result is one of cinema's greatest epics, aided by impeccable animation and great voice acting flawlessly synchronized into the movie.  Complete in itself but still feels unfinished - ""Princess Mononoke"" is one of the great originals of all time, and now all we can do is treasure it while we wait and hope for a ""Princess Mononoke II"" to come and be one of the great sequels of all time.",1099440000,9,2126,5.220588235294118
1323433,5,B00003CXBK,"The thing about Japanese animation is that it isn't always for kids.  We as Americans associate animation with cartoons and therefore assume they are for children.  Movies like Akira and Cowboy Bebop have a certian level of maturity and violence that is not suitable for children.  Now, though Princess Mononoke is not as violent as some others, it does have a few scenes that are questionable in terms of children's viewing.

I believe that this film is amazing not only in terms of the animation, but also in the message it gives.  It is sad but also makes you feel good in the end.

To better understand other films like this one, it is important and nearly vital to understand the culture of Japan.  I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but not every culture is like America in its values and customs. Before passing judgement on this and other animations form Japan, it may be helpful to take a class on Japanese Culture and/or popular culture.  I do, however, recomend it highly.",1096243200,,981,4.662790697674419

""Princess Mononoke"" is a powerful tale of war, hate, and love.  The heroism it displays shines with a strange sense of justice and humility, which sets a very interesting mood for western viewers who are more accustomed to cinematic interpretations of somewhat boastful legends (i.e. Troy).  Though regardless of the viewer's ethnicity, the intense moods, beautiful scenery, interesting symbols, deep characters, and unforgettable plot are almost sure to come down as a moving weight on the tasteful movie-watcher.",1095120000,,661,5.398058252427185

It has such a nice story and few things that deal with japenese legends like the kodomas and someone said this was supossed to be in japan, but I find it odd there was wolves in it, but I dunno if they're native..

Ethierway this was a great anime to see and is no way comparable to disney films there was no previous movie or manga before this was made so it's not really coppying like what disney does with things like bamby, alice in wonderland(sp?), and a few others..

Also there is nothing wrong with anti humen why because there is too many shows where animals are some evil creatures, I really liked it where nature was goodguys for once.",1095033600,,755,4.340425531914893
1323476,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke has won kudos and fame for its complex story and gorgeous animation. Created by Hayao Miyazaki, this is not a tale for the young kids.

We begin with Ashitaka, a boy in feudal Japan who kills a boar that is infected with demonic anger. He heads out to find the source of this infection. As he goes on his quest, he gets embroiled in a struggle between the wild survival of nature and the deliberate progress of technology.

The title Mononoke is a human girl who was raised by wolves. She fights alongside them to defend her homeland. The people of ""Irontown"" are of course taking over the forest to fuel their industry. But nothing is ever black and white in this movie. Nature lives on a creed of kill-or-be-killed. The humans simply want to survive as well, and that means they consume resources.

There's a rich blend of Japanese mythology in the story as well, helping you understand the underlying beliefs that many in Asia hold dear. It's like talking about fairies and wishes in a European story, about wishing on a star or crossing fingers for good luck.

This is NOT a movie for the young. I know a 9 yr old who saw this and was upset for weeks afterwards. It involves a lot of violence and adult themes. There are no easy answers here. But for teens and above, it does give you a lot to think about.",1094947200,,1328,4.430327868852459
1323477,5,B00003CXBK,"It unapologetically shows decapitations and dismemberments, slaughter, betrayal and murder. Those blithely seeking cartoon pabulum will be shocked and offended. But if you are looking for provocative intelligent adult anime, then Princess Mononoke is like a sea wind blowing away the saccharine smog that smothers western animation.

For one thing, it has no villains. This will confuse childish minds conditioned to expect not only good and bad in every movie, but to have the bad guys clearly labelled with black hats, scars and ugly sneers. For another, it doesn't hide its ambivalence with technology or its respect for nature. In fact, that is its thesis: how we lose our way when we reject our connection to the natural world. This will offend narrow minds who look upon any challenge to their anthropocentrism as ""anti-human"" or ""tree-hugging sentimentality"".

This film argues that evil is not so much the satanic absolute modeled in western tradition as it is an organic malady caused by pain and despair. We do not become evil because we are corrupted by some outside agency; we become evil because we choose hatred over acceptance when confronted by the inevitability of death. How many western cartoons dare to tack into such philosophical winds?

Princess Mononoke punctures conventions. The princess of the title is a wolf-child saved from death as an infant by a wolf god and her pack. Now consider: in a western cartoon, the wolf pack would be a misunderstood and persecuted animal family too cute for words and too noble to stomach. In this movie, they are a snarling force of nature who do not hesitate to kill. However, they earn our sympathy because we understand that they are driven to kill both out of necessity and because it is their nature to do so. In a western cartoon, heroic animals would automatically mean casting their human opponents in the role of villains. But in Princess Mononoke, the humans compete for our sympathy because they too are convinced that they must destroy the wolves to ensure their own survival. In a western cartoon, the male hero would rescue the female heroine to live happily ever after. I won't spoil the ending, but consider how much more intelligent, more thoughtful and truer to character is the conclusion in this film.

This juxtaposition of conflicting needs and loyalties, all with their own justifications, their own perspectives, and their own claims on our sympathies, combine to produce a richly textured world that is complex in scope and multifaceted in meaning. This film does not capitulate to simplistic solutions. Much of hard work and great beauty is destroyed in the end, but the film still concludes on a note of hope, with the thought that something of wisdom has survived all the death and destruction, and that nature recovers and humans rebuild, perhaps this time, avoiding the mistakes of the past.

Like all of Miyazaki's works, he strives for significance over saccharine sentiment. His films are gourmet meals beside the candyfloss of western animation, and I feel a sense of intellectual satiation and fulfilment from Princess Mononoke that western animation rarely invokes. This is intelligent animation for intelligent adults. One need not agree with Miyazaki's world-view, but discerning viewers can't help admiring the beauty, the vitality and the intelligence of it.",1094947200,5,3359,5.1
1323478,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke will forever stand out in my mind as a movie that acutally manages to avoid the cheap, inchaote good guys v. bad guys dichotomy. Mononoke has a good guy, but everyone else is full of true to life ambiguities. Simply put, the viewer can understand where each antagonism arises and festers. The main character thus stands out as a strange sort of Christ figure:  he refuses to damn the others and seeks to quietly do all that he can for anyone he can.

This is a highly imaginative film (as are all Miyazaki films), an full fledged action film, an ecological polemic, and, surprisingly, even a profound moral commentary. I highly recommend it.",1094256000,3,659,4.721739130434782

miramax definitely deserves a pat for bringing it to the english world. only thing that sulks me is the absence of any great extras on this dvd release. it is a real irony that an exceptional film like this has been given such a shoddy treatment. i purchased it long ago when it was released by miramax, thinking someday there will be a special edition release. since then many years lapsed but there's absolutely no sign of any such release. something i would like to add here is that buena vista japan has released a very special 3disc deluxe edition dvd there, in japan, which alongwith, the main feature, contains the whole storyboard of the film in multi angle viewing option and a very special long documentary on the making of the film (sigh!!!). and that's just not all...there has even been a separate dvd release called ""how mononoke hime was born""!! great stuff, i'm sure!

WITH THIS REVIEW OF MINE AND ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS OF FANS LIKE ME AROUND THE GLOBE, I REQUEST BUENA VISTA,U.S. AND DISNEY TO KINDLY RELEASE THIS DELUXE EDITION ON REGION1.

I ALSO REQUEST AMAZON TO KINDLY START A SURVEY AND LET THE STUDIO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR ITS RELEASE AND DYING TO OWN IT. PLEASE EVERYONE, VOTE FOR IT.

1) Quality of picture. I was impressed the way this cartoon is created. There is no computer enhancement - just pure paint works with wonderful vivid colours. I enjoyed watching beautiful landscapes and realistic characters.

2) A story. After watching ""Tokyo Godfathers"" and ""Spirited Away"", I realized that Japanese animated stories are always unique, interesting and catching. I wasn't bored a second! Even though there is some violence, the main themes of the movie are love, support and kindness.

3) Music. The music for this movie is composed by the acclaimed Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi. Based on the score for this movie, Joe Hisaishi released a separate symphonic suite. The main theme of the movie is a popular hit in Japan; it is being played or sung by various artists.

I can watch this movie several times, as I like quality of animation, the story and the music.  This DVD includes a version of the movie dubbed in French. As I learn French I think I have an excellent chance to learn it with such a pleasant DVD!

1323481,5,B00003CXBK,"I'm glad the first real anime film I ever watched was ""Princess Mononoke."" I never, or almost never, watch anything animated anymore, so stumbling over this brilliant piece of art was fortuitous to say the least. I'm not usually one to buy into hype, but the blazing blurbs on the DVD cover, trumpeting this movie as the most wonderful piece of anime ever made, did convince me to rent it for an evening. So did the gazillions of praiseworthy comments I subsequently found after viewing the film. The fact that several big shot Hollywood actors-including Billy Bob Thornton, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, and Claire Danes-provided the voices of the characters almost scared me away from this picture. I figured that the only reason these actors signed on to the project revolved around the idea that the central theme of the movie concerned industrialization versus nature. Well, it probably was the driving force for these actors, but you can look beyond all that and just enjoy the film anyway. And trust me, you'll love ""Princess Mononoke."" Set in medieval Japan, the movie is complex, beautiful, and inspiring.

Young Prince Ashitaka runs into a big problem when he suffers a serious injury after battling a frighteningly evil creature outside his small village. The wound, a bite mark on his arm, is incurable according to the village doctor. Ashitaka will eventually morph into a demon unless he can somehow find the elusive Princess Mononoke, a human raised in the wild, who may know how to cure this dreaded disease. Leaving the village is difficult for the young prince because local tradition dictates that he may never return. On his trip into the wilds of nature, Ashitaka runs into a mysterious monk named Jigo, stumbles into a war zone, and discovers a fabulous metal works factory run by the beautiful Lady Eboshi. It turns out that this factory, staffed largely by women, produces guns and ammunition for the samurai armies. Eboshi doesn't limit herself to only dealing with one customer, however, as she is a dedicated capitalist willing to sell armaments to anyone with money. When Ashitaka finally meets Mononoke he discovers that the denizens of the forest are attempting to fight back against Eboshi's machinations. Obviously, Ashitaka must decide which side to take in the battle for the earth. He is torn between giving into his love for Mononoke or battling the humans.

""Princess Mononoke"" is much more than a simple action tale, although there are plenty of intense combat sequences. Love plays a big part in the story, between Ashitaka and Mononoke as well as a love for the purity of nature. Malice rears its ugly head, too. Not only is Eboshi filled with odium, but so is Mononoke as she battles the humans destroying the wilderness. It's to the film's credit that it never takes a black or white view of either humans or animals. Each side has an ugly aspect that often emerges in startling ways. The movie eventually seems to say that humans need to forget about dominating nature and instead find their own niche within it. Still, there can be little doubt about where the filmmakers' sympathies lie. All of the greatest scenes in the movie involve Ashitaka's interactions with nature and the animals. The animators pulled out all the stops in presenting a truly magical world. Pay special attention to the wondrous nature god's awe-inspiring transformations and the little forest apparitions that appear to guide Ashitaka through the forest. These scenes constitute the finest animation I have ever seen, animation that should rightfully carry the tag ""art"" more often than not.

The only problem I had with the film concerned some of the voiceovers. I thought Billy Crudup did a fine job as the heroic Ashitaka. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Claire Danes's work as Mononoke. I continually felt this actress had no conception of her character or how to convincingly vocalize her attributes. I began to develop a distinct sense of dread every time Mononoke opened her mouth. As for the other American actors, they did an acceptable job. Thornton did better than I thought he would as the voice of the wily Jigo, considering this actor's southern accent, but then again the monk doesn't appear too often in the movie. Only after I watched the movie and returned it did I think about viewing it in Japanese with subtitles. I suspect that would have been a better way to see this film. These criticisms in no way require me to give ""Princess Mononoke"" less than five stars.

The DVD edition of the film does contain a few extras, including some interviews with the American actors voicing some of the characters, a trailer, and a widescreen presentation. I didn't think animation would use widescreen, but what do I know? ""Princess Mononoke"" doubtless appeals to fans of the anime genre, but it should have an equal effect on non-fans. I know I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was seeing in this movie-yes, it's that powerfully beautiful. I wouldn't just watch this one again; I'm thinking about buying myself a copy. That's how much I liked the darn thing. Maybe I ought to start watching more anime in the near future.",1092700800,3,5190,4.901023890784983

That being said, I have to say that this was a very impressive effort by Mizayaki, but perhaps not quite as engaging or imaginative as Spirited Away (those are the only two Mizayaki films I've seen).  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was a bit sugar-coated, but for me it was not enough to ruin the overall experience.

This film's political message is a bit preachy, and it runs a little long (nearly 2 1/2 hours), but all in all, this is a very entertaining film.  Recommended (but NOT for young children).",1090800000,,764,4.62962962962963

1323515,4,B00003CXBK,"The reviews for this typical Miyazaki blockbuster are so rabidly of the WOW mentality that you may expect something mind-blowing. 'Manage your expectations and enjoy the bloody ride' is my advice.
In terms of sheer execution this is one of the best anime capers you'll see, replete with beasts of mythic proportions, lush forests, sparkling waterfalls, and some mind-numbing inter-galactic slaughter. I could wager in a blink that this is what inspired Tarantino to do that little anime insert in Kill Bill Vol 1.
Plus, the film has some swank credentials under its belt: the Japanese voices are dubbed, not just subtitled, by big *American* stars -- Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Bill Crudup, etc -- who lend their laryx to a host of universally relevant issues such as the plight of indigenous people and nature in the face of unchecked business interests, the death of spirituality in the name of social progress, misogyny in its many variations, etc.
But I have my gripes. The film is violent. Very violent. Sometimes senselessly violent. I had to frequently turn my volume knob to the left. There are gigantic guns, and blood and guts splatter the landscape every minute. Most of this soon seems overdrawn (and the film is looooong) with all this supposedly cool action amounting to precious little in terms of any clear message about good versus evil. The underlying purpose is summed up brilliantly by a roadside beggar when he says something like the world is cursed, but we still find a reason to live.
I also found something lacking in the animation itself. While exquisitely vivid it seems to lag in its flair for capturing natural motion. Disney or Pixar movies  pore over a sense of suppleness when an eye is raised or a muscle is twitched by a character. Miyazaki's animators on the other hand haven't penetrated beyond the skin, the moving creatures feel inarticulate and jerky, particularly when played against the very 2D painted backgrounds.
But that still doesn't stop me from recommending this powerful cult flick, a must if you're an anime acolyte. If not, then be prepared for a Tarantino x 100 and you'll do fine.",1089849600,5,2155,4.920329670329671

1323520,5,B00003CXBK,"I just watched this one again, not for the first and not for the last time. There's just so much to like here that I hardly know where to begin.
Others have already pointed out, at length, that the founder of Irontown is hardly the Evil Queen she first appears. The Princess has flaws of her own, as well. Each, however, has a moral stand that holds together in its own way. In fact, the real problem comes from a character that first looks minor - his amorality turns out to be the most destructive force in the movie.
What keeps me coming back to this film is the setting in which all of the movie's action occurs. It is clear to my Western sense that I'm watching a very Eastern movie. The forests and factories could be anywhere, mostly. They are set in a world with its own history and mythical beings, though, and they aren't any history or myth that I know. Somehow, Miyazaki creates a meaningful story out of pieces with meanings I don't understand. It makes me want to learn about the tradition and lore that he draws on for his imagery.
This is not just great by the standards of animation, it's a good movie by any standard. It really is worth enjoying again and again.",1087689600,,1180,4.343891402714932

The sense of wonder you can get from this film is a lasting one.  Anyone with an open mind and heart will enjoy it immensely and will continue to enjoy it with repeated viewings.  I don't want to start describing it in any more detail, but the film is not for every taste so I'll just say, SEE THIS FILM if

However, if you're new to Miyazaki and anime in general I would recommend caution and an open mind as well. Unlike most American animated films, anime is an adult genre and this film is not for children. It is very violent (pushing an R rating, in my opinion) with a complex plotline, mythical references, and much that the kids just won't understand. There isn't the nudity often found in other anime - the absence of which seems to be a Miyazaki trademark - so that's a plus, but if you're looking for something suitable for children I would recommend some other Miyazaki films instead. For the youngest, the English language versions of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" are adorable. For those who enjoyed ""Spirited Away,"" I also highly recommend Miyazaki's adventure ""Castle in the Sky.""",1079481600,4,895,4.894736842105263

  Detailed animations, use of colors and interesting story lines are all hallmarks of a good Miyazaki feature. This film is no exception. Disney is now distributing his films in America, there's no way they could make film like Princess Mononoke so the did the next best thing.

It is a fantasy story with Gods and Demons and sometimes reminded me a little of the Lord of the Rings, so if you like that kind of storylines and animation this movie is a must see, it's the most impressive Japanese animation I have ever seen.
Voices are done by Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver as a Queen wanting to kill the Forest Gods.

1323652,5,B00003CXBK,"A film by Hayao Miyazaki
This is probably the best Miyazaki film that I have seen.  It rivals Kiki's Delivery Service for having a story that I could get involved in and truly enjoy, but it also surpasses Spirited Away in terms of quality and storytelling craft (in my view).  Kiki's Delivery Service used to be my favorite Miyazaki film, but I believe that has now changed.  Princess Mononoke is a superior film.
This is a fairly complex story about technology vs nature.  Near the beginning there is a boar which appears to be covered in some kind of grub worms.  Wherever the boar steps, the grass and trees die.  The boar is on a rampage and when it appear that the boar is headed for his village, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) is forced to attack and kill the boar.  Only then does Ashitaka learn that the boar was really a forest god turned demon.  Ashitaka was infected and the iron ball that was the poison inside the boar is also going to poison and kill Ashitaka.  Ashitaka heads to the west to find out how to seek out the Great Forest Spirit and find a way to cure this poison.
Ashitaka finds his way to Iron Town and meets the leader, Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver).  Eboshi initially seems to be the villain, but as we get to learn more about her we see that she is not a villain, but rather simply human.  She is destroying the environment to create iron weapons and materials, but she has also rescued prostitutes from brothels and takes care of them.  She is both sympathetic as well as a harbinger of destruction.  Eboshi has a nemesis in a young girl living with the wolves named San (Claire Danes).  San has been raised by the wolf gods and is fighting to preserve the forest and the gods.  Ashitaka sees the good in both, even if neither San nor Eboshi can see the positives in the other.
I have only touched on the surface of the depth of this movie.  It is a story so big that it could only be told in animation (I just don't think that live action could have succeeded with this story).  The animation is beautiful, if a little graphic at times with the violence. This is definitely not children's animation.  Besides being one of the best films of Miyazaki's career, I would rate this as a great movie.  Period.  Forget about it being a great animated movie, this is a great movie.  Princess Mononoke also features the voice talent of Gillian Anderson, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Billy Bob Thornton (who does a fantastic job).  This is a must see.",1069632000,,2460,4.432071269487751
1323653,4,B00003CXBK,"I find most of it tiresome... Confusing or non-existing plots, thin characterizations, dialogue tangents that stray from the story, occasional surrealism to make even Salvador Dali go, ""Huh?""  Princess Mononoke doesn't suffer from any of these.
Even if you're not a fan of anime, you should check this movie out.  The visuals are stunning.  One really can not praise this movie enough for its wonderful animation.  From the wide shot landscape scenery to the tight action, Princess Mononoke offers the best there is in Japanimation.
The story will make you comtemplative.  The ""bad guys"" aren't truly bad, and the ""good guys"" aren't 100% good.  It's all about shades of gray, like real life, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of morality lessons one can carry away from it.
The English translation is well done by voice actors you will easily recognize, but I also recommend watching it in Japanese with subtitles.  The Japanese speech has a beauty to its rhythm that isn't as present in the English dialogue.  Also, there are some subtle differences in the subtitle translations versus the spoken translations.  They're minor, but I found them interesting none the less. <P  Mononoke comes very close to being truly outstanding.  Give it a try.",1069027200,6,1253,5.033980582524272
1323720,5,B00003CXBK,"I am a very harsh critic on Japanese Anime.  Most of the hub bub surrounding Japanese anime is in part because of the violence in the ""cartoon"".  Normally, at least in my case, the stories don't make sense, the characters have extremely exaggerated features such as huge eyes, tiny or no nose and tiny tiny mouths. Plus it's almost like watching cardboard, with the background moves as the characters are ""running"" (basically standing still in a running pose). Sometimes in anime they will only have a body part moving, like an arm or a hand picking up a cup of coffee, as if to signify the every day habits of people. Most of the time there is no depth to the characters, they don't cast shadows, the background is your basic squares and circles.  The buildings are all the same, side characters are extremely poorly drawn and are mostly baboonish, basically lifeless around the main characters.  The stories are illogical and they are missing the connections that get you from one scene to another.  Having said all of that...
 You get none of that in Princess Mononoke.  It is by a wide majority not only the best Japanese Anime made, but ranks right up there as one of the top animation films of any country.  Not only that it is one of the best films, outside of animation release.  This film doesn't try to dazzle you with CGI (Computer Graphics) and it's not out to try to make the characters look as humanly real as possible.  This film instead embraces animation and makes it an art.  The characters movement are fluent and features are proportional, the background has depth and the story makes sense. Not only that, the filmmaker, knowing that he has a certain freedom with animation, creates these little clicking creatures which acts to the wonderment of this feature.  The films is not only beautifully done visually, but the sounds and the music, which normally gets overlooked, are as good as any live-action feature.  The director paid so much attention to detail that the best way to see this film is widescreen with a DVD.  If you don't see it widescreen, because of the framing, you will be doing yourself a bit of injusted, I think.  I don't want to describe what the story is about because I think this is one of those films that every little bit you find out for yourself makes the film that much more enduring to you.  It's nice to let a picture without preview, fanfare or story description, unfold before your unknowing eyes.  This film is rated PG-13 for images of violence and gore but I think 10 years old and up can handle it. If they can handles films such as Star Wars, Willow or other fantasy movies, they can handle this one.  It's worth having in your DVD collection.",1067040000,,2702,4.59375

If you appreciate real art, including the art of entertainment, you will love Miyazaki. Not necessarily for little kids, unless they are used to the hard facts of old-time fairy tales (giants, decapitations, soldiers fighting what have you).

That said, this is an enchanting, riveting tale about a boy who has to overcome the demonic disease festering in his hand after a battle with a giant boar that could potentially kill him if he doesn't hurry. Surprisingly, it grants him incredible killing strength (there's one scene where he beheads a man just by shooting an arrow at him). He meets San, a girl raised by wolves, who tries to protect the forest from the evil Lady Eboshi.

But this Movie totally blew me away. The only thing that threw me off was the boars in their demon form. (Covered in vains or maggots and throwing up gallons of blood.) I loved the design of the main characters and the fact that Miyazaki saw both sides of the enemies and made it so that no one was evil. You felt bad for both humans and animals. No bad guys. That's what American movies are all about. Any way I reccomend this and The Rurouni Kenshin OVA's and Spirited Away. I don't even watch Disney any more it lost its touch a long time ago.

The action is non-stop and full of suprises.  There are many compelling characters, the sound track is excellent and the story is top notch.
The film opens when the last young warrior called Ashitaka of a village notices something unusual in the woods approaching his village.  Some sort of mysterious beast makes himself known and begins to attack Ashitaka and begins chasing him.  This is no ordinary beast, it appears to change form and consists of a bunch of worm-like creatures.  Everything in its path is destroyed with ease.  While Ashitaka tries to defend his village, he manages to shoot the beast with two arrows which eventually incapacitate it, but not without a cost.  While Ashitaka was defending his village and attempting to keep the beast away, some of the worm-like creatures grab hold of his arm and cause him great pain leaving an unusual scar.  Later, after consulting with the wise woman of the village, Ashitaka is informed that he has been cursed by an evil spirit and is in grave danger.  There is however one chance of him curing himself.  To cure himself, he must travel to a far away land and find the great benevolent spirit of the forest.  On his journey to finding the great spirit, he faces many trials and tribulations, meets friend and foe but most of the people he meets are consumed with anger and hate which makes it all the more difficult and adds an element of complexity to the story.
The film makes two very powerful points about man and his quest to dominate nature and about the consuming and destructive power of hate and anger.  The destruction of nature can only lead to man's own destruction and anger merely fuels more anger and hate which if not stopped will completely consume the individual.",1063065600,2,1888,4.650602409638554

This is his first truly beautiful film, one in which the landscape and characters possess immediacy and plausibility. The musical score is sensational and the voice-dubs work more effectively than I imagined.

1323778,5,B00003CXBK,I originally saw Princess Mononoke when a friend said she had it and she wanted me to see it. I was skeptical at first but when I saw the movie I was in awe. The story is a mythological story with unforgettable images. The characters are great because they have a realistic human element. No one is truly good or evil. The townspeople of Iron town are fun. My favorite is the ex-hooker Toki (Jada Pinkett-Smith). I love this movie and I think anyone who gives it a chance could love it as much as I do.,1059177600,3,502,4.185567010309279

1323780,5,B00003CXBK,"A fantastic, beautifully done film, Princess Mononoke deserves a spot in your DVD collection. The transfer is very good, the sound adequate, and there is a short, mildly interesting featurette, with comments by the English-speaking actors (Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup, Jada Pinkett Smith) and the Dubbing Director (who states the dominant themes of the film, such as ""to explore man's relationship with nature"").
The dubbing job is OK, but not great.  However, Minnie Driver did a very good job as Lady Eboshi.
Director Hayao Miyazaki (who created the fabulous My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service) has written and directed a film with a suspenseful story, compelling characters, uplifting music, and beautiful artwork, with misty mountains, scenic countrysides with rice paddies, mossy forests with sunlight streaming through the trees, and dramatic battles in the rain.
The noble heroes, Prince Ashitaka (from a tribe that was ""almost wiped out 500 years earlier"") and Princess Mononoke (brought up by a gigantic white wolf-goddess in the woods), are courageous, virtuous, respectful of the spiritual world, and want to protect nature--against the encroachments of ""civilization."" Some of the other characters are greedy or suspicious, but none are evil. Lady Eboshi, for example, wants to kill the Great Forest Spirit, but eventually sees the error of her ways, and also treats lepers well and purchases the contracts of prostitutes, giving them jobs in the iron-smelting works. Her troops also defend Irontown against the samurai army of a voracious lord.
There are a few gory battle scenes and the demons are a bit scary, and you might want younger children to wait until they get a little older to view this film. On the other hand, some of the forest spirits can be quite charming, especially the ones with the revolving, clicking heads.
The story can get complicated. There are numerous gods and human characters, but the theme of ""civilization versus nature"" is simple. Lady Eboshi wants to cut down the forests and bring more civilization (i.e., mining, industry, agriculture, and towns) to the world. Prince Ashitaka, from an endangered, persecuted people, is a natural ally to the threatened forest spirits. When he is infected by a demon that has possessed a boar god, his quest to cure himself propels him into the battle between the forces of nature and civilization, and he tries to get the humans to co-exist with nature.
The great battle between the boar army and the humans (shown in flashback) is majestic and exciting. The boars are bedecked in white war paint and helped by Princess Mononoke and two wolf cub gods. The concluding scenes, with the Great Forest Spirit searching for its head, are done magnificently.
This is a film that your family will love, and want to see many times. I recommend it highly.",1055980800,,2861,5.113247863247863

It can be viewed both for entertainment enjoyment and on a more serious level. Indeed it brings up a lot of cultural and moral issues but there is no doubt that it is still an exploration in fantasy. This is already considered by many to be a classic and a ""must-have"" and this is justified. It definetely has that intriguing foreign flavor but everyone can identify with it.",1055808000,,521,4.4375
1323782,5,B00003CXBK,"First, some concessions.  I do not speak Japanese, so I can say nothing about the Japanese language version or the quality of the translation.  Also, I am not an rabid anime fan, and in fact this was the first japanese-animated feature film I ever saw (I have seen more since).  Finally, this movie takes maturity to watch and appreciate - there is some graphic animated violence and mature themes throughout.  Now, on to the review.
This animated film by Hayao Miyazaki is absolutely amazing. It embodies all the things you should look for in animation, and it stands as one of the greatest films - and, along with Ran (directed by Kurosawa), my favorite film from Japan.  First, let me say that the story was terrific, using developed characters and tackling real-world problems of environmentalism and technology tastefully and without an abundance of feel-good Sierra-club nonsense a la Captain Planet and Ferngully.  It explores humanity's relationship with nature, the struggle for human survival, and the difficulties of human advancement.  While there is a large degree of sentimentalism (Randians beware) the story should appeal to a wide range of audiences.
The most amazing thing about the movie is the art and art direction, all masterfully done.  The entire movie is a feast for the eyes, both characters and backgrounds are drawn with fascinating detail and rich, crisp color.  The artistic and directorial talent deserves the utmost respect.  You'll have to see the movie to believe how good it is.
The sound is well done, but for those of you wanting to utilize your overly expensive surround sound systems, you'll find yourself missing out (sorry).  The sounds are crisp, though, and complement the visual experience beautifully.  The music is a chapter all to itself, both complementing the other senses and leading your emotions throughout the whole film.
The voice talent is mixed.  Americans will certainly recognize Jada Pinkett Smith (horrible), Minnie Driver (excellent), Billy Bob Thorton (so-so), and Claire Daines (excellent).  A fellow reviewer claims that the poor voice actors hurt the movie beyond repair, but this is nonsense.  The dubbing is excellent (read: does not look stupid and mismatched).  Regarding translation, see the concessions.
This movie showcases japanese animation and animation in general.  The crispness of sound, enchantment of music, and vividness of color make this film a thrill ride for the senses.  The movie avoids the problem of having many things happening at once, and clearly shows what is happening even during the fast-paced battle scenes -- a sure sign of directorial experience.  Praise for Hayao Miyazaki is practically neverending.
If you enjoy Japanese animation, you probably already own this film.  If you absolutely hate it, watch this movie anyway - I think it will change your mind.  This movie is essential for any DVD library.  Buy it.",1055635200,11,2912,5.177350427350428

1323840,5,B00003CXBK,"I think many people have misread the theme of this movie- obviously there is the evil of man in the iron industry, but there is also the evil of nature, as evidenced by the gods of the forest who let their hate for mankind consume them. This is why I love this movie- it is not the traditional American hippie-nature-is-always-good, nor is it trample across the forest. BOTH mankind and nature have lost their way, and the main character, a sort of dark, brooding, savior of sorts comes to tell them that both of them are wrong and if they continue on their path both of them will be destroyed. That's at least what I got out of the movie. I think the visuals are stunning and serve to emphasize the story and theme, and the violence has a purpose for being in the movie, and could not be called gratuitous by anyone's measure. I love this movie because it is quite different from most of the anime that seems to make its way to American shores. I don't know if they're keeping all the best stuff in Japan, but some of the stuff I see is no better than our own American animation in terms of content and execution. Then of course, are the rare gems such as this. Miyazaki is a genius, the equivalent of George Lucas (before the prequels), Steven Spielberg, and Walt Disney (the man, not the company), all rolled into one, with a vision and craft that transcends them all. Magnificent.
Billy Bob Thorton had no reason to be cast for this movie- bad decision, but I won't let it mar my love of the underlying movie.",1053734400,,1513,4.368794326241135

Of course there's blood and mild language in it, that's why it's rated PG-13, don't you think? Of all the characters, the wolves would have to be the best! Word of advice--if you want you younger kid (hey, I'm 15, not a kid!) like 7 or so, and you want them to watch a kiddie anime, may I suggest Pokemon? Maybe even Hamtaro?

1323845,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke is a movie for anyone. It is not restricted to fans of anime, but to those intelligent enough to appreciate such a great story. It represents everything that is great about anime. It leaves out the senseless sex and violence that plagues many anime films and give anime a bad reputation to those who don't know any better. Fans of Ninja Scroll might very well be bored by this film but the truth is they're not looking for an insightful story. No, they're looking for an endless amount of gore that looks 'cool' according to them.
Princess Mononoke does have its fare share of violence but it's rather tame in comparison to some other anime. True, it does include some decapitating scenes but they aren't without reason. Considering the character's cursed arm is turning him into a demon, the options for showcasing that terrifying power are quite slim, especially when the bow his the weapon of choice. If the arrow was to wound the enemy just as it normally would, then it would prove nothing in terms of the character becoming a demon. It is also important to note that these killings are not glorified in any way, they're brief, and to the point. There's no need for pools of blood and guts.
The dubbing in this movie isn't spectacular but you should never expect it to be, in my opinion. If you watch a dubbed movie expecting to be blown away then you're already putting too much emphasis on it. Some people have a real hard time with dubbed films and in some cases I agree, it gets in your head and to tell your self not to think about it is to think about it. You know dubbing's done right when you never have to pay any piece of mind to it and that's why Princess Mononoke works for me. Some people are arrogantly sold on the belief that subtitles are the only way to translate movies. They will watch any dubbed anime and pick out every flaw they can find, which in turn ruins the experience. I pity these people.
The visuals are no doubt spectacular, there's no room for debate, you will be impressed. The story backs up the animation perfectly. A person familiar with eastern philosophy/culture will likely have an easier time picking up on subtle things but to be honest, this movie is not very complicated. Any westerner should have no problem with it, so long as they pay good attention.
If there's one complaint I agree with to some extent is the lack of character development. You probably won't find yourself caring to much about the characters. The thing is, Princess Mononoke is beyond individuals, and to develop some characters even more would be wasted time in a movie that's already long. You will learn all you need to know. The main character is a man away from his normal surroundings, trying to find truth. He has a short time to live, no time to waste revealing his own quirks which define him. But he is human after all, so we do get to see small glimpses of his personality at times. As for the main heroine, one could argue that she has too much personality considering that she's brought up by wolves. The side characters have a good deal of personality which is great.
Now some people have a problem with the ending. It appears to be rather static but gained knowledge and wisdom should not be underestimated. It is a fine ending to an amazing movie. Anyone open to fantasy should love this film.",1051401600,14,3347,4.533884297520661

While the English voice over actors are quite good, I do recommend a viewing or two with the Japanese voices and English subtitles.  I don't speak Japanese, but the characterization of THOSE voices adds a lot to the story and the English subtitles are a bit different than the voice over.
The creatures come, I suspect, from Japanese myth and are very different than anything I have experienced in Western myth.  It is quite wonderful.  There are powerful and disturbing images that might not be suitable for very young children, but there is no gore for gore's sake.

1323991,5,B00003CXBK,"It is difficult for me to select a favorite Miyazaki movie because I happen to be fond of all of them, but if I were to choose, PRINCESS MONONOKE would definitely be one lucky candidate. This aesthetically breathtaking, multi-layered epic about the legendary clash between man and beast set in a forest-covered world became Japan's hugest box office grossing movie ever upon its 1997 release. Taking the whole movie into account, it's really not hard to understand why. Not just a depiction of what happens when hatred gets out of hand and/or when nature is threatened, this is a lavishly animated spectacle as well as a compelling exercise of portraying its characters neither as perfect heroes or deplorable villains, but flawed, believable people displaying tangible emotions.

The film's action begins when a courageous and compassionate Emishi prince, Ashi-taka, becomes infected with a deadly curse after killing a demon attacking his village. In the hopes of finding a cure, Ashi-taka sets off toward the West astride his faithful elk, Yakul, and finds himself caught in the midst of a war. On one side is a proud clan of human commanded by the ruthless Lady Eboshi, who is clearing the forest mainly for the sake of her own people (a group of outcasts which consist of lepers and brothel girls). On the other side are the Animal Gods of the forest who want to destroy the humans and protect their natural environment, led by the intimidating wolf matriarch Moro. Her human cub, Princess Mononoke herself, aka San, harbors a grudge against all humans and desires to kill them all (namely Eboshi)... or die trying. When Ashi-taka rescues her, however, she finds herself developing feelings for him that she's never felt before--are *all* humans truly evil, or is there at least one who can be trusted?

Families who have been spoiled by Disney movies may probably have a hard time determining who is ""good"" or who is ""evil"", but as mentioned, this is not Miyazaki's intention. His movie is meant to display the flaws of human beings and their inability to understand how their own inner demons and/or consummation of another world can bring about deadly consequences. The only character in the movie that comes close to being a villain is a squat monk known as Jigo, who wants the head of the mystical Forest Spirit in exchange for riches. But even then, Jigo has his own motives; he is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"".

It is probably a little daring to say that out of Miyazaki's films, this is probably his most ""adult"" film to date, for it contains more violence than most of his other work. For example, in one scene, Ashi-taka, possessed by the curse on his arm, tries to stop samurai from attacking innocent people, and in doing so slashes off one man's arms, and later, another's head with two arrows. Horrifying and disturbing as the sight is (as well as some occasional blood spurts), such moments are included only to show its devastating effects. Some Japanese animated features tend to go overboard in depicting such gory sequences; in the case of PRINCESS MONONOKE, however, the violence never overpowers the meaning of the story, and is actually done in a way that is neither gratuitous nor squeamish. Even so, this is a movie that is arguably best appreciated by older viewers rather than youngsters.

For those who love to watch Studio Ghibli productions for their state-of-the-art production values, PRINCESS MONONOKE will do little to disappoint you in this area. Every frame is painted with imaginative visuals and exquisite detail that I have rarely seen matched in other animated films. Not only are the forests lush and magical but the creatures who inhabit it are difficult to forget, especially the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will as well as the Great Forest Spirit himself--a tall, human-faced deer whose every steps make plants grow. At night he becomes the Nightwalker, a ghostly specter that towers over the trees. This is one of the many spectacular moments of wonder that, if anything, warrant the purchase of this movie--in addition, of course, to the compelling, multi-faceted characters and equally sweeping storyline.

PRINCESS MONONOKE was picked up for distribution by Miramax several years ago, and while everyone loves to fault them for the many mistakes they made in handling this movie (such as giving it only a non-existent marketing campaign), I'm sure there are those who will argue that Disney's English tracks for Miyazaki's movies are some of the best around, and this is no exception. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman's adaptation is not only faithful to Miyazaki's original screenplay (changing around only a few things here and there for comprehension purposes for audiences unfamiliar with its Japanese customs), but also just about every word of dialogue seems to avoid the somewhat clunky, odd-sounding lines that some dubs can sometimes suffer from. The English voice cast chosen to speak his script consists of various famous stars; these include Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Gillian Anderson, and Jada Pinkett-Smith. All provide solid vocal performances; some folks have issues with Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo and Claire Danes as San, but IMO both are every bit as good as the aforementioned actors.

The DVD presentation of this movie is phenomenal; the visual clarity is spectacular, and the English, Japanese, and French audio tracks are all reference-quality.  On the other hand, the minimal extras are a bit of a sour note. All that's included are a theatrical trailer (where Miyazaki and MONONOKE are both mispronounced) and a skimpy featurette featuring comments from the principal members of the voice cast as well as ADR director, Jack Fletcher (Gaiman appears briefly). Hopefully Disney will one day revisit this masterpiece and give it the luscious two-disc treatment it deserves.",1047168000,,5901,5.01530612244898

1323995,5,B00003CXBK,"Master filmmaker Miyazaki has created one of the most beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. Frankly, I'm beyond impressed. Anime seems to have a much more realistic feel and the themes are very adult in nature. With intellectual themes, magical creatures and mature relationship issues, this is one captivating movie.

Even though the film doesn't make judgments about good or evil, it does make a statement that pervades the entire story. The message is ecological in nature and asks many questions about the role of humans and animals on the planet. The characters have to deal with loyalty, fate and death. The characters are really not trying to save the planet, they are dealing more with survival issues.

Princess Mononoke was raised by wolves on a mountain. She wears a fur type coat with ears attached. Very cute. The mountain is ruled by the forest spirit who never speaks, but has the power to give or take life. The tiny forest spirits that rattle their heads are adorable. They are like little ghosts. The forest spirit changes shape at night and when he walks through the forest as a ""deer god,"" flowers grow around his hooves.

The forest is so beautiful it is not difficult to see why the animals want to preserve the pristine location. The animals all talk and are larger than most animals. In fact, they are actually gods defending their mountains. There is quite a bit of violence so this is not really an animated movie for children. They might be a bit frightened by the boar crawling with demon worms or the huge explosion that kills the boars.

Ashitaka takes up the role of warrior and kills a demon-boar monster threatening his village. In killing this angry beast, he is cursed and retains a marking on his skin from the battle. When he arrives in the forest, he finds himself torn between helping the animals and helping the humans.

""Ashitaka: Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like! This is what it does when it catches hold of you! It's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me! Fear and anger only make it grow faster!""

I think it is honor that drives him to help the women of Irontown. I don't think he really is fighting on the side of Lady Eboshi. At least we don't want him to because she is after all trying to kill the forest spirit. I think Ashitaka is trying to take both sides or is at least trying to promote peace. He sees that humans need to work to make a living and that might include chopping down a few trees. The wolf tells him that when the trees are chopped down they cry. I don't like chopping down trees, but I don't think they cry. ;) That was when the movie went off into a more mythological interpretation.

While Princess Mononoke takes the side of the wild boar tribe, Ashitaka takes the side of the outcasts working in an iron mine.

A much more realistic feel than most Disney animations. This also has a much deeper emotional appeal for adults.

I could have watched the dragonflies and butterflies in this movie for a much longer period of time. The delicate mist floating over the lush hillsides was amazing in itself. The beauty of the forest spirit was just amazing and really you just have to see this movie to believe how beautiful animation can be. The scenes of the Night walker are just astounding from an animation perspective.

Though it maybe a cartoon, it is full of imagination, and will captivate you more than most of today's movies, and it will change your life for the better.",1044662400,2,379,4.352112676056338
1323997,5,B00003CXBK,"Far too many people hear ""anime"" and automatically have some bad connotation.  They think it's too childish or too mature.  This movie is a great place to start, whether you want to see anime or are completely turned off by the genre.  Why?  First, it was produced domestically by Disney, and you know they aren't going to put out something too racey or ridiculous.  Second, the voices are people you know, like Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton (and someone who sounds a lot like James Earl Jones).
What else makes this so appealing?  Well, Billy Bob Thornton himself said that watching this, he forgot it was animated early into the movie.  The story is also compelling, with a rather Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy appeal.  The basic plot is that a boy must travel to find the Spirit of the Forest to have a curse removed from him.  On the way, he comes across a mining town, and the story moves into a ""harmony with nature"" kind of message.  Although it gets much more complicated, I'd prefer not to spoil too much of the movie.
Besides the story and familliar voices, the animation in the movie is excellent.  For those who have watched a fair amount of anime, it becomes obvious that there have been dramatic changes in quality over time.  This move is recent enough that it has a high quality animation.",1043798400,3,1317,4.581196581196581

You don't need to understand anime or know what manga is to appreciate the greatness of this movie. There are no excessivly gory fights, head sized boobs, sexual scenes or other rather adult aspects often found in anime films.  But despite this, this is not one for the little kids.

But the story, too, stands out from the crowd. Written by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki and adapted into English by writer Neil Gaiman, Princess Mononoke is the story Ferngully wanted to be. It tells of a great clash between humans and nature, with the animal gods and forest spirits rallying to stave off encroaching devasation. The archetypal figures, such as the Night Walker, are magnificent, but there are also the smaller gods and fey beings for a lighter touch.",1043625600,2,691,4.815126050420168

It is VERY well put together, things flow well, they don't have that run of the mill anime reactions or such, like if one made this into a MOVIE with actors, real places, etc, it could be done almost exactly.  It is easy to follow the basic plot which makes this a favored item amongst children AND adults.  The only problem with letting small children watch this is because there is death and killing involved, but the idea of death is a basic idea in the plot.  Not ""glorifying"" death, but the idea of death plays a very key role in this movie.  Even if one does not enjoy animes or ""cartoons"", this one goes beyond those simple terms and gives them a new meaning, I have had relatives who despise cartoon movies or animes watch this, and after they watch it, i had 19 out of 23 relatives say it turned out to be a very good movie, the others didn't like it simply because it was cartoonish, but they liked the plot.

Enough about price, though, let's talk about the movie. The movie has spectacular animation and a great plot. A prince is poisoned by a demon and is banished from his little town. He journeys and finds a town that produces iron and guns. A goddess/princess chick and these 3 cool talking wolves are trying to kill the ""ruler"" lady of the town because they destroyed the forest. In the end, I'm still not sure who really won: nature or the destructive humans. It's funny that Billy Bob Thornton was one of the characters (voice). This movie is great, a treasured part of any DVD collection. I reccomend it to anyone. The only people I know that didn't like it are my grandparents who are more into ""classic"" movies and those sort of older films. You won't regret seeing this movie! It's killer!

1324119,5,B00003CXBK,"Japanese anime has a never-ending ability to surprise and refresh my concepts of that is possible in an 'artificial' format.  Perhaps this is merely due to my status as a rank amateur, but I seem to get more excited by this format than I have by any other in some time.  There is something in anime that reaches past the traditional limits of modern illustrative animation
For example, take 'Princess Mononoke.'  On the surface, this is not a complicated film.  Prince Ashitaka receives an evil wound while defending his village from a forest wild boar god that has been driven insane by poisoned bullet.  The village wise woman tells Ashitaka that he is doomed to death, and sends him on a quest to the home of the ruined deity, where his task is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hatred.'  And so, Ashitaka comes to Irontown where the need for resources has put the town in conflict with the natural world about them.
The beautiful Lady Eboshi leads the town on a perpetual assault against the forest.  There, with the aid of Jigo, the Emperor's representative, she plans to kill the forest spirit and give its head to the Emperor.  Opposing her is the wolf girl San, Princess Mononoke.  San and her wolves are fighting a losing battle to stop Eboshi and her villagers.  She has renounced her fellow humans and seeks to kill all who endanger the forest.  Into the middle of this steps Ashitaka, who tries to help both sides to survive, and receives few thanks for his concern.
Too often, this type of plot would invite a great deal of overacting and bombastic dialogue.  Yet that is exactly what does not happen in Hiyao Miyuzaki's delivery of this tale.  The viewer will come to love the villagers and can at least admire Lady Eboshi for her fierce determination and care for her own.  Jigo is driven by greed, but he is hardly unwise, and knows how to bend with circumstances.  Mononoke is angry, fiercely bloodthirsty as well as beautifully and tragically heroic.  Only Ashitaka is all of one color, despite a wound that threatens to turn him into a demon.
Instead of being a pretty film with a message, Miyazaki has created a film with many levels.  He turns his eye to many conflicts that have no clear resolution and allows them to retain the dignity of their context.  Thus, an animated film becomes more real than reality, where even the tragedy of change can become life affirming.  The naturalness of the translation and dubbing (carried out under the watchful eye of Neil Gaiman) will also surprise those of us who are used to having to watch the sub-titles to get a true sense of what is being said.
This film is extremely worthwhile, and watchable by any audience that can manage the unavoidable violence.  One that will stay in mind for some time to come, and that I will mention when someone asks me what I would recommend as an introduction to the complex world of anime.",1039046400,9,2886,4.610567514677104
1324120,5,B00003CXBK,"This question is at the heart of Princess Mononoke. Most of the other characters at one time or another think he is against them. At first viewing it's hard to tell what the main character is up to. He saves the Princess, then he saves Lady Eboshi. Then he's going to help the ""bad guys""? What?!?! Who is evil and who is good? It's not instantly obvious, which makes Princess Mononoke stand up to repeated viewings - many repeated viewings. The story is complex, but not too complex. It's main themes are humanity versus nature (i.e., itself) and hate. Hate destroys and eats away flesh. The tentacle-like demons fashioned from hate provide some of the most incredible animation, and some of the most poignant scenes. Another theme is the idea that sometimes the best side to be on is neither side.
The animation is about as good as it comes. Miyazaki is one of the best, and this is one of his best pictures. If the story happens to bore you (it shouldn't), just look at the incredible animation that never lets up. The animated grass growing towards the end is particularly incredible.
Animation does not get much better than this. Visually and thematically, there are not many as good as Princess Mononoke out there. Given its themes, it's somewhat surprising that Disney brought this masterpiece to the States. Sure, some of the English dubbed voices are a little off, but this doesn't detract from the film much. It's interesting to watch the film in its original Japanese with English subtitles. The characters come across a little differently this way, and the translations are different in the subtitles. For instance, the ""Forest Spirit"" becomes the ""Deer God"" in the subtitled version. The voices also are incredibly different, and those who don't appreciate Billy Bob Thorton's drawl will enjoy the Japanese version.
There aren't many movies worth owning and watching over and over again, but Princess Mononoke is definitely one of them.",1038787200,,1948,4.888217522658611
1324121,5,B00003CXBK,"As an old-school anime fan I was at first put off by the obvious American influence in this movie, especially in the dubbed version. I was very sad at the thought of such a classic cult phenomenon as Anime' being mainstreamed; the same feeling I had gotten when I saw that, after twenty years, George Lucas had finally digitized Yoda. I was sure I was about to watch the death of something unique that had been swallowed into the mass media forever, and I prepared to greive and gripe nonstop.
 That feeling lasted about thirty seconds.
 I have sinced watched Princess Mononoke about fifteen times, and each time it gets better and better. Old-school fans, take heart - it's not the gut-twisting violence of Akira or the tongue-in-cheek comedy of Dirty Pair, but Mononoke offers superb, smooth-flowing animation of exquisite detail and texture. All the quality one could ever expect from today's high-tech animation is readily visible, but you won't see CG anywhere.
 The story details and violence might be a bit much for the little kids, but adults will love it. Simplistic themes of man-against-man and man-against-nature tangle intimately with underlying tones of mystery, community, love, despair, and ultimate sacrifice. This is a complex movie; it lacks the rough edges so common in line-drawn animation. Neither is it a bland, commercial delivery mass-produced for inspection. It is ART. It is PASSION. It sits in the mind and heart like a well-shaped stone in a Zen garden, awaiting contemplation without distressing the stomach.
 I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in animation (Japanese or American - Disney fans, beware the quality coming at you, it might unseat you!) or to families with children old enough to grasp the concept of a small struggle inside a larger one, inside a massive one. My seven-year-old will be seeing it shortly - with me. AGAIN. Aw, heck - I recommend it to ANYONE who enjoys a good story and likes to watch good movies.

For those who don't ""get"" the medium, no amount of gushing will persuade--your loss, but know this: Miyazaki infuses all of his work with the soul of a poet and his work can often be quite moving.
Like much of his other work, Princess Mononoke is for older children and adults, not for unsuspecting toddlers.  The themes explored are dark and disturbing--and highly relevant to these times.  There is violence depicted.

You could easly compare this one with Akira as being a influental anime of the year. It has made most anime directors re think the way their going to make their anime.

1324260,5,B00003CXBK,"INTRO:  4/5 people like this movie usually.  Out of all the people I have ever met that watched this movie, I can count the people who didn't like it on one hand.  Its a great fantasy movie that depicts Japanese culture, great fight scenes, awesome storytelling, and a lot of nature.  I know a lot of people are already thinking that a nature movie can't be that cool...well, this movie definitely proved even me wrong!
First of all I would like to mention that even though this movie is rated PG-13 and depicts some scenes of violence, I wouldn't hesitate to show this to a younger kid.  There are like 2 scenes I would question, but they aren't even that bad.  This movie has so much beauty that a lot of people just look at the violence and immediately call it mature, when in reality its far from that. Take a look at a lot of supposed ""kid-aimed anime shows"" and you'll notice a lot more fan service and violence than this movie.  I shake my head at those sad souls that say this should be an R movie.
DVD:  The DVD is average, but great at the same time just because it is Princess Mononoke.  But looking at it unbiased, its just average.  You have the basic Chapter Selection, Language Selection, Subtitles, and Extras as usual.  But its far from complaining.
EXTRAS:  Not too much to keep someone going for a long time after the movie is over.  There is a featurette that talks about the dub, and how the actors that dubbed it felt about the movie.  Some other extras not really worth mentioning like trailers.  But its a nice effort.
AUDIO:  Japanese and English audio tracks are included, but this is one of the rare cases when I would have to say the English out-does the Japanese by-far.  The English dub was not your typical dub mind you.  They recruited many famous actors like Gillian Anderson (X-Files), and Billy Bob Thorton (Switchblade) that play the characters perfectly.  They really went all-out on it and there is a lot more ""feeling"" behind the voices.  Watch and compare.
VIDEO:  Very crisp and clean.  I could eat off of my screen if it weren't so dusty.  I didn't expect any less.
OVERALL:  This is DEFINITELY a must in any movie-lover's collection... be they anime-fan or not.  I hesitated too long to get this movie and was glad when I did.  This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and get really attached to the characters, its just that good.  I can see them re-doing the DVD though in the near-future with more extras and such since this DVD didn't have a lot in that category.  Look for ""Princess Mononoke Special Edition 2-Disc DVD Set"" one day, but until then, do yourself a favor and get this version.  You won't be let down.",1029888000,3,2688,4.450819672131147
1324261,5,B00003CXBK,"<for those of you who saw the original review, erase it from your heads. it had too much of that ""Parental advisory"" crack>
This should have gotten nominated for Best Picture, but you know how society has prejudice against animated films, they think they can't fit in. Well, for those of you that are one of those people, when you see this film, you'll nail yourself for ever thinking that.
Oh well. Nail the prejudice. See this film. To hell with the academy.
It's a good fantasy movie. It's as good of a fantasy anime as Akira is for a sci-fi anime. While it can get really gruesome, Hayao Miyazaki, as always, puts some of the stuff he always did with his other films, like ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", and the upcoming ""Spirited Away.""
Oh yeah, if you think this movie's sick, check Akira out. That should be a huge kick in the face.",1029715200,,857,4.5
1324262,5,B00003CXBK,"This is epic story of man and nature. It shows the struggle of both man and nature to survive, and protect their kin. Nature and humanity have been at it for a while now, and they both have a strong hate for each other, blind of any sympathy or out look for a positive future with each other. This world changes suddenly when a wounded warrior travels west to find a cure, after he kills a possessed boar, and part of the demon slowly grows on him. This demon is fueled by hate. When he travels to the West and see this war going on, all he sees is hate. He says his goal is to ""see with eyes free of hate""...only then will he be cured. What he does is befriends both the humans and animals, getting caught between them trying to help his new friends. It doesn't seem to work as they both push him out and tell him to stay away ""traitor"". But when things turn to the worse, there he is to try to save both nature and man from ultimate destruction and teach the way of love. The ending is nothing short of amazing. This is an amazing tale that all should see (if you are old enough to see depiction's of battle and gore), that shows you how nothing good happens when you hate each other, and only want the other dead. And of course the animation is some of the best, in the field. Every scene has such minute detail and fluidity. The only negative spot its extras aren't great. But this is not a dvd you want to get for the extras, its the epic, story that sends a positive message to this world which is going through so many hardships. Its not just about man destroying nature, its more universal, about any two groups destroying each other. Put this on and watch a quality animation film, that's more than the everyday Saturday cartoons.",1029715200,,1739,4.240963855421687

1324305,4,B00003CXBK,"This is certainly an extraordinary piece of work.  The animation is superb, with some very beautiful effects and tableaux that will take your breath away.  The action scenes are also very well done, and are frequently riveting.  This is a real film, not a kiddie cartoon; and it takes advantage of the potential of its medium like few things this viewer has ever seen before.
The impact of the film is limited however by poor development of the plot -- it's not that convoluted, it's just inadequately presented -- which makes it essentially impossible to follow.  And some of the characters' voices are so quietly and murkily recorded that you simply can't make them out.  It's unfortunate, because it really mars the movie.
Having said that this is a unique achievement that certainly bears watching at least once.",1027468800,,816,4.884057971014493
1324306,3,B00003CXBK,"After reading all these great reviews about the movie, I decided to give it a go, and I have no idea how it garnered so much praise. It's got vivid colors and generally good animation, but the theme of technology encroaching upon old traditions is nothing new, except this time they had talking pigs and cute little forest spirits, which kind of reminds me of Fern Gully, and in many ways this movie is like a Disney movie. The characters do not develop except in the most cliched of ways: the main character is your typical do-gooder hero type and really doesn't grow throughout the movie, and the villainous village leader realizes the error of her ways after a catastrophic loss...blah blah blah. What's worse is that it seems like the makers couldn't decide whether they wanted to make this a family film or an action anime flick, resulting in some strangely comical action scenes where heads fly in the air but no blood comes out. Despite its shortcomings, I'm giving it three stars because it's fairly entertaining if you are just looking for something fun and simple to watch for 2 hours. If you're looking for anime that'll leave you overwhelmed with emotion, try the Evangelion series instead.",1027123200,,1202,4.755980861244019
1324307,5,B00003CXBK,"This was one of the first annimes I bought.  This movie was highly recomended and I see why.  The mixture or combat sequences, crystal clear annimation and the excellent music composition made this an excellent movie.
I watched this with my parents (who hate annime) and they ended up loving it.  They also loved the music and beautiful annimation.
I loved the way they introduced the shoulder-mounted riffles.  I thought that was amusing when the sword-happy samarais tried to take on the rifflemen.  I'm a big fan of riffles so I love it when they have swordsman square off against rifflemen.
The overall aspect of annimation was top notch.  Well done annimation and I loved the forest background.  Even my parents were impressed with that.
The character developement was great.  They explained everything without boring you to death.  Some annimes I've seen have put me to sleep while they explain everything.  I though the lady's bodyguard with the oversized 'bent' sword was hilarious.  He always got the short end of the stick.
But my favorite part was the music.  I loved it, I bought the soundtrack and I play it all the time.  It mixes perfectly with the story and plot.  I can see why this movie made it in theatres.
Overall, worth buying not matter what movies you like.  I recomend watching even if you don't like annime.  If my redneck parents can enjoy it, so can you.",1026950400,,1382,4.7196652719665275

This is a tale about a quest for the truth, about facing our destiny, a story to find out that hate that cames from humans, animals and gods, could destroy life... and death.
It could be enough to say that this movie got more money than Episode I in Japan. Is a long and slow story, filled with real truths, where you can feel the sights of the landscapes, where no one is completely evil or good. A journey through the Japanese mythology, with a great english track that captures the real sense of the traditions, keeping the story intact. This dvd features the literal translation, for those who would like to enjoy the original japanese wording. Great sound.
There are just two additional features: a featurette that only shows some comments from the english dubbers, and a trailer. Anyway, just to watch the movie is worth the price.

1324377,5,B00003CXBK,"It's Anime alright, but it isn't your typical Anime.  I would classify this under Classical Anime in a heartbeat but it also finds itself to be the first anime for most people.  Personally... it was my 4th Anime Movie.
Genre/Setting: Fantasy, Ancient Times surrounding the initial invention of the Gun and the mining of Iron.
Art Style, realistic and very beautiful, a worthy Masterpiece of art.  As you can tell i really enjoyed it.
Nudity: NONE... most anime has a little... even if it's a small insignificant scene it at least has something, but this anime... nope, not a thing.  A major reason it can be viewed with the entire family there.
Violence is low in comparison to other Anime.  But for the family scene, this Anime contains scenes of cartoon death, dismemberment and animal attacks.
It is the story of a young man who becomes cursed while saving his village from a demon.  The demon is actually a large Bore that became possesed by hatred when he was shot by a human.  The curse will spread throughout the young man's body until it kills him.  So, in the meantime he will journey to the heart of the evil behind the bore's hatred to learn for himself the truth ""with eyes unclouded by hate"", so that he may find peace.  From there the plot unfolds.
This is not a sword battle movie and though the image on the cover may appear like a lightsaberesque duel is taking place, i assure you it is not based on combat.  In fact the young man in the image rarely takes up his sword in any sort of battle... he's better with his arrows.  And as misleading as the Title may be, it does not have some sort of Helpless princess... Princess Mononoke is just a title given to the daughter of the wolf god.  The movie does have large animals who are like gods and even a forest god who reigns over all of them, but there is no preaching of this religion.
On the cast list are names like Claire Daines, Mimi Driver, Billybob Thorton, Gillian Anderson (who plays the role of the Wolf god, whose japanese voice is done by a really deep bass... kinda confusing).  With such names as these taking up the role then it's gotta have something in it right?  And i hear that it almost ran off with #1 movie in Japan, falling to the hyped up Titanic.  It is an anime that the entire family can enjoy and one that will remain classic to all Anime fans, casual and hardcore.  It was one of the first anime's my family saw, and trust me that the kids will love it... at least all the kids i know of have loved it.",1024531200,,2498,4.351293103448276
1324378,5,B00003CXBK,"Although I am a big fan of Japanese Animation, one doesn't have to be to enjoy Princess Mononoke (also known a Mononoke Hime). There is certainly a reason why this film is Japan's top grossing film ever, not just animated film, film period.
Mononoke has a fabulous story line, set in Fuedal Japan, this movie is primarily about the struggle between nature and man in an industrialising world. It doesn't limit itself to that though, another main theme is dealing with conflicts and hatred. I really respected the way that the characters were represented. Since I consider myself close to nature, I naturally felt more sympathy for San (who is the Princess Mononoke), and the forest gods. However, her enemy, Lady Eboshi, was by no means an evil character, and was very good to people, such as the lepers that she cared for. This emphisised that there is no firm line between good and evil, and theme that I always like to see in movies.
The animation of the characters, and especially the sceney was incredible. No animated movie has ever posessed such quality in my opinion, Disney and other american companies pale greatly in comparrison.
I have shown this movie to many of my friends, most all of whom are not fans of animated movies, and not one has thought it anythign but spectacular. This film is not only one of the greatest animated movies of all time, or one of the greatest foreign movies of all time, it is possibly the greatest film of any kind, ever.",1024272000,,1464,4.656370656370656

Add to that the fact that no one learns anything in the end of the film, the evil humans are still evil, the dumb kid is still just as dumb. One of my friends recommended this too me so me and 2 other people sat for 2 hours trying to like it. When we told my friend we all hated it she said ""But wasn't it pretty"" and truth be told thats the only reason anyone would like this film.

1324441,5,B00003CXBK,"Hayao Miyazaki is such a great man for many reasons. One of them is, after making so many movies at Studio Ghibli, such greats as:
* My Neighbor Totoro
* Nausicaa of the valley of wind ---
( his first with Ghibli, and at the same level, maybe higher, maybe lower, than Mononoke Hime.)
* Pom Poko
* Grave of the fireflies
* Laputa: Castle in the Sky
He STILL can make an epic like Princess Mononoke. What a fantastic man! Princess Mononoke is indescribable in words, so I won't bore you by details. Just watch the movie, the animation, plot, music by faithful Joe Hisaishi, and overall feel will suredly blow you away, whether your an anime fanatic or not. But I would fell discontented to even call this an anime, among so much crap.  It's a freakin' subcategory! MIYAZAKI! The man even gets praise by fellow legends as
Akira Kurosawa and Katsuhiro Otomo (may God rest his soul).
  Another reason Miyazaki is so great is that, well... he is so darned hard-working, creative, and brilliant! I really despise computer animation, hand-drawn animation is the most creative, fluid, and inspiring in my mind. This movie is very exciting, and fun to watch.
 About the DVD, I recommend Japenese language with english sub-titles. I personally dislike the english version, though I do like Billy Bob Thorton's performance.
DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:
*Featurette
*Theatrical Trailer
*French language track
*Japenese language track

No.  It was far worse than I could have ever envisioned.  The last 1/3 of the movie and the ending in particular left me searching for words.  I was dumbfounded that this tripe could receive a good review, much less the almost universal praise that it had been given just after its release.  In a word, shocking.

It takes on the issue of humanity vs enviroment and is depicts the time period when mankind begins to first successfully develop firearms. Like many oriental fables it is full of spiritual mysticism in the form of living gods that share our planet. The movie is set in an area inhabited only by a village that strip mines for iron, surrounded by vast forested wilderness. The plot is about the struggle of the villagers to get the land for mining away from nature and the gods that protect it. The animation in this movie is superb and the story is straightforward but thought provoking. It presents questions that have no easy answers in an exciting story that is artfully rendered.

1324447,5,B00003CXBK,"This movie is called the ""Japanese Star Wars"" by many, and it's easy to see why. Gorgeous visuals, a moving story, and mythic underpinnings will remind Western audiences of Lucas's masterwork.  However, in some ways this is a deeper and more complex work.  Unlike the clear cut good / evil dichotomy of ""Star Wars,""  all the characters in this story have an element of goodness, even those like the lady of Iron Town that we initially may not want to like, but who rehabilitates prostitutes and cares for lepers.  And the easy answers of the prince hero are shown to be shallow to a certain extent.  However, although the viewer is left to make his or her own evaluations, there are clear messages: the forest and the forest spirit are sacred, and in the end not understandable by humans.  Those consumed by hate, for whatever reason, are in the end demonic and to be shunned as well as pitied.
A beautiful, thrilling blend of animation and storytelling.  A small warning:  just because this is animated, don't make the mistake of thinking it is a ""kiddie"" film.  This movie has powerful messages about very adult issues, and there are moments of explicit violence.  A movie to watch and talk to about with kids, not to use as a mindless babysitter.

After escaping from an army of Samurais he arrives in Irontown, where they make guns and use iron as a source for everything.

The animation and often comical characters of Toki, Koroku, and others make it easy for a young kid to watch; thematic elements dealing with the conflict between man and nature allow an older audience to enjoy.  The scenery is beautifully done, but I suggest that, if you get this DVD, to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, and even then you don't get the full beauty of the language used.

The script is amazing. The whole thing about ""seeing with eyes unclouded by hate"". Who comes up with something so perfect, so ingenius oh it's amazing.
Another great thing about this movie is the director can make you feel however he wants you to feel. You can hear your heart pound at all the dramatic seens, you laugh your eyes out at all the funny scenes. You say ""sw e e e e ttttt"" in a hoarse gasp at all the action seens.
A strange thing about this maovie is they got alot of famous people to do the dubbing. Boy am I glad they did too. they did such a perfect job (like a said earlier)

  I have to say that he is one of the most creative & inspired person I know of. I have never been disappointed with any of his movies. Remember Tenkuu no Shiro Rapyuta (Laputa - Castle in the Sky)? Do you remember how his blend of flying ships, amazing artistic style & colorful characters made you feel? Do you remember how the ending in Kaze no Tani no Nausica&auml; made you feel? He can't do anything wrong. It's impossible. He's Miyazaki. His movies make you feel either really adventurous or sometimes disappointed in the entire race.
  I know not of many other artists who can make you feel such different emotions, and yet he does it time & time again. Unfortunately, he has retired now and we won't be able to see anything new from him. That's okay, though. Do you know why? Because his lifetime achievements are just that. Enough for a lifetime. I would be overwhelmed with all that greatness if he continued to make films.
  I'm sort of relieved, I feel I don't deserve any more of his masterpieces. Wow, I've never even typed one sentence about this movie! What can I say? The animation is superb, fluid & colorful. The story itself is enough to make you really think. It's so smart, so intelligent. It's just a really good story. I can't even put how I feel about the story to words.
  How can studio Ghibli's animation skills keep getting better? It's truly remarkable! The film itself is very spiritual. When I first saw it, I left questioning a lot of things about myself. Maybe if you see it, you'll understand where I'm coming from. Needless to say, I cherish & adore this movie. I hope you will, too.",1012435200,,1719,4.504823151125402

There are NO good guys and bad guys. They're for Disney movies.

Minnie Driver's character, Lady Eboshi, wants to destroy the forest, but she took in the freakish outcasts known as Lepers whom no one else would accept. This movie will have your mouth open with one disturbing scene, but 20 minutes later you'll might even be near tears wit the sheer beauty of things.

1324616,3,B00003CXBK,"This is, indeed, a beautiful production; real eye-candy.
I had no difficulties with the voices -- i particularly liked Billy Bob Thornton, who caught just the nuance with his characterisation that Jack Elam at his most comically villainous brings to live-action films.
The story isn't all that complex, but the characters and their relationships *are*.
Is the hunter, who wants the head of the Forest Spirit to win a fabulous reward that the Emperor has promised, an evil man?  Certainly, many of his actions are what one might call evil or lead to evil, but i'm sure he doesn't think of himself as anything but a business man.
Is the Lady of Irontown, who wants to kill the Forest Gods (demiurges incarnate as huge talking animals) and destroy the forest, so that she can mine ore more easily, evil?  Certainly, evil will come of *that* plan -- but the community she wants the ore to support consists in large part of girls she has rescued from brothels and lepers whom no-one else will take in, whom she has not only taken in but made respected and respectable members of society, which certainly indicates she is something other than evil incarnate.
Are the Forest Gods themselves, turning fang and claw and tusk against humanity, battling in blind fury when nothing else seems possible, evil?  Hardly.  But they are representative of a way that *must* pass with the coming of humanity, and hard as it seems, their time is over.
Is ""the system"" evil? Is human civilisation, in and of itself, evil?
Is it possible to reduce the whole issue, as Buffy does at one point on TV as ""Fire bad -- Tree pretty"", saying that wildness and trees take precedence over human progress and expansion?
Or, conversely, to assert that, *of course* humanity's needs take precedence over those of nature and wilderness?
The answer -- to either of the last two questions -- of course, is ""No, it isn't.""  Everything must proceed by compromise, in balance, or we and the world we live in will go down to disaster.
The earlier parts of this film look as if it may turn out to be a pure tree-hugger's ""ecology"" spiel, but by the end, it is obvious that the survivors (on both human and forest sides) have taken the lessons of their adventures to heart, and are probably going to manage to come to some sort of modus vivendi that will enable both to exist and to interfere only minimally with each other.
Would the real world could learn such lessons.
((BTW -- i didn't read the subtitles, i listened to the English-dubbed version [which is excellent in terms of sound quality and voice selection], and i didn't notice anyone being referred to as ""Princess Mononoke"" or any variant thereupon.  Is the title a descriptive phrase that merely *sounds* like a character name == ""Princess of the Wolves"", or some such -- or werenames changed for the dubbed version?))",1012003200,5,2839,4.702213279678069

1324618,2,B00003CXBK,"I'm sure some people will accuse me of being a purist.  OK, I can live with that.  BUT I don't think you have to be a purist to feel the way I do about this film.  This film may have been the biggest seller of all time in Japan, but the English language version wasn't, isn't and will never be.  Why?  Because even if the translation was perfect, which it wasn't, there are WAY to many concepts inherent in the story that cannot be understood without extensive knowledge of Japanese history.
Take the ending for example.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who felt like the ending fell a bit flat.  That's because, while I have studied Japanese history, I don't have the true FEELING of what it means to be a samurai, to follow the samurai way (bushido).  I don't truly comprehend the honor system, as most Japanese people do.  And while I do have some real experience with Japanese romantic relationships, I (and most westerners) don't share their belief in unrecoited, and even unspoken, love.
On top of that, I strongly disagree with the casting choices made for many of the voices.  Many of them were, in my opinion, simply monotonous, possibly because, I think, the voice actors were chosen because of the popularity of their names, rather than their actual abilities to do voice work, which is definitely different from acting in front of a camera.  (Don't get me wrong, I love Gillian Anderson on camera.)  And further on that subject, it just didn't fit to have have WESTERN American accents (and I am American) coming from traditional Japanese mouths, and it was even more inappropriate to have vastly different accents coming from characters living in one of the most homogeneous societies in the world.  Once again, casting for the sake of popular names.
NOBODY can fault Hayao Miyazaki for his work.  The animation was fantastic, the story epic, and the music perfect.  But after seeing (unfortunately proceeded by buying) this film, I MUCH prefer watching it in the original Japanese version, even though I can't follow the dialogue.  I'll keep it, but only because it helps complete my Miyazaki collection.",1011744000,2,2119,4.764383561643836
1324619,3,B00003CXBK,"When my sister bought this fabulous Dvd in the US, I was instilled with wonder that many of you will have felt when encountering a Miyazaki film for the first time. However, when I recently watched some of Miyazaki's other works in a Miyazaki film festival, I've changed my opinion.
  Don't get me wrong, I still love this movie, and I was impressed by the lack of any identifiable ""Bad Guy"". The English dub was among the best I've seen (Bravo Neil Gaiman! All hail the greatest western comic author!), but the likes of Claire Danes irritated me to no end. I liked the use of English voice actors (well, only one I suppose), but it seems fundamentally wrong for one of the leading characters to have a whiny voice with an American twang to it (cough cough, Sai, cough cough).
  As epic as some of his earlier films, yet with a depressingly cheesy ending. The musical score is catchy and fits the mood of the movie well, while the animation rolls on to capture your imagination. This being one of the first Miyazaki films to extensively use CG graphics, I feel they have mastered the art of electronically colouring scenes. But I felt the CG was used in such a way as to make the separation between hand drawn scenes and CG too obvious. I hope his next film, ""Spirited Away"", they will make better use of CG morphing technology.
  Unless trying to complete your Miyazaki collection, buy Nausicaa, Laputa, and Totoro first, otherwise leave this one for the odds and ends of your budget.",1011571200,2,1485,4.56390977443609

A monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thorton) travels along with him to a mill-industry driven town lead by Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver) for a new home until he finds out that Eboshi and other warriors are off trying to kill the forest of the ancient wolves, boars and other creatures including a brave female warrior named San a.k.a. Princess Mononoke (Claire Danes) who is one of the protectors of the forest that was raised by wolves. However Ashitaka falls in love with her as he decides to join on her crusade with the wolves and other forest spirits to protect the god of the forest from being destroyed as well as trying to find that cure.

Co-starring the voices of Jada Pinkett Smith, Gillian Anderson, Keith David and John Dimaggio this is the ultimate 90's animated masterpiece. This fantasy adventure is from animation auteur Hayao Miyazaki and one of the most original movies ever! I love how it compels the viewer into the complex story with it's dazzling animation and great voice acting even in the dub version. It's PG-13 rated for violent images and some gore but it can still be viewed by the family for it teaches everyone a good message about nature and living in harmony with the world. The score by Joe Hisaishi is magnificent and the film is a unique, imaginative and brilliant work of art that i enjoyed it since it got a US release and saw it in theaters.

This DVD contanis both Japanese Language in subtitles version which you can go to the audio selection feature even with the second subtitles as 2 extras like featurette and trailer.

The animation is clean, beautiful.  The way the humans  and animals move is quite subtle but when you pay attention to it, the level of work and thought is amazing.
The  story is chocked full of mysticisim, and is set in an age when man and beast lived side by side, and thier tolerance of each other is growing weaker and weaker day by day.
The most amazing thing about the story is the complexity of all the characters. not a single one could be placed into a stereotype, Goodguy, badguy, clown... whatever... They all have a degree of complexity to them that can make a viewer love and hate them at the same time...  All the characters have a goal, even if it means going against each other, but each of them have very valid reasons and are not evil for what they seek.
Oh yea, A great score too, the orchestration really accentuates the plot and amplifies the characters emotions without being too distracting, which is a nice change.",1011052800,3,1093,4.307317073170732

When this film was released in the U.S. it was chocked full Hollywood names for the voice-overs, and distributed by Miramax Studios. It was celebrated by critics and loved by audiences....and ""Princess Mononoke"" isn't a bad film. I don't see how it became so popular in Japan though. It's PG-13 rating gives it away that it's strictly for profit and not for art. For having that rating it pushed the envelope as close as it could, which is a plus. The film, however, was marred by over length. The film wasn't bad, the story was rather interesting at times, it had two stories going on at once. It did slow down near the end, it could have been 20 or 30 minutes shorter, and I'm not exaggerating. Besides the conclusion the film is pretty well done, the animation is clean, the colors are lush. It's much brighter than most Anime, which isn't necessarily a good thing, but it works well with the film.

  Anyway, this is the best anime movie I've seen, and while I will admit the English translation is a bit ruff around the edges, it is far too minor a flaw to put a damper on my feelings about this masterpiece. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, only rivaled by the absolutely-spectacular-but-not-quite-as-great Ghost in the Shell. I should also note that this movie can be quite violent at times(such as decapitation and dismemberment of limbs), but I feel it is simply an active portrayal of battles in ancient Japan. They didn't suger-coat anything, and I like that! But if you don't enjoy seeing great globs of blood, just keep in mind that, no matter how good the animation is, it is still just 2D pictures with paint over them.
  All in all, this is defiantly a must see for anyone over the age of 13 who enjoy really good anime. I highly recommend this movie, for it is truly a shame if the only people who are watching it are little kids who aren't even old enough to legally see it without their mommy's.",1010275200,,1231,4.506726457399103

So i am by no means a huge anime fan, i mostly just like big robots, but this movie, I like. The animation is excellent; very clean and smooth, no real strange or shaky character animations or over the top anime faces ( ie huge mouths and tear drops over the head). The movie is very interesting if a little confusing at times. In fact I didn't really get it until i'd seen it 3 times. Tho there is blood, a lto of blood by american animated standards, but pretty normal fair as far as anime goes. A few guys lose some body parts as well ,but it's nothing too horrible. The picture is clear and crisp, the sound, while not astounding, is very good. It has a Japanese and English voice track, tho i prefer the english. The voices match the characters very well.
Overall the movie is very excellent. The story is well written and enthralling. Not jsut for anime fans by any means.

He can direct offbeat, intimate masterpieces like *My Neighbour Totoro* and masterpieces of epic proportions like *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* (one my favorite ten movies of all times). *Princess Mononoke* belongs to the latter category:  it is a mythical allegory of man's relationship with nature, set in a medieval Japan filled with talking beasts, strange fairies with rotating heads, mystical deer and animal corpses animated by energetic, wriggling maggots.
I have always found that the better a movie is, the more speechless it will leave me. I once started writing a review for another of Miyazaki's masterpieces, *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but I never posted it because I was so intensely moved by his genius that I was not able to say anything articulate about it. This is sad, because I consider very few films to be as deserving of a good review as *Kiki*.
So I will let the five stars do their work of recommendation, and merely say that I personally consider Miyazaki (together perhaps with King Hu) the greatest moviemaker ever, and *Princess Mononoke* one of his highest achievements.",1007251200,4,1135,5.037234042553192

1324748,5,B00003CXBK,"I had to be forced to watch this movie in English.  After years of watching (hearing?) good anime nearly destroyed by bad dubbing, I voted for subtitles.  I'm glad I was outvoted!  I can't comment on the translation, but the ease with which the voices fit with the charaters, and the excellent phrasing really impressed me.  Later I found out that Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and thought, ""no wonder!"".  (confused?  read Neverwhere, or Stardust, or the Sandman series)
The animation and story of course are wonderful, and other reviewers have covered them in better detail than I could.  Just thought I should put in a word for the fine work put into the English version.",1006819200,2,681,4.769230769230769

1324750,5,B00003CXBK,"Okay let me get this out of the way, all you people talking about how anti-human this movie is, know what your talking about before you even think that. The movie sends no such message, it's a mythological story it's almost like this anime is teaching us a lesson: Don't mistreat nature. I don't know, that doesn't sound anti-human at ALL. Second of all, I read a couple of reviews that say it's too violent, well, it's rated PG 13, so to the people who show their 7 year-olds this movie and say it's too violent-- well read the rating and make sure your child is mature enough to watch this movie. This movie did not disgust me at ALL. Sure the boars do look ugly, but that's to show how one-sided they are. Now on to the review.
Animation: Superb
Dubbing: No anime's dubbing is too good, but this one is pretty nice
Plot: Here is the movie's strong point
Creativity: Definitely
There are tons of reviews that tell the story, so I'll skip it. The animation as I said is superb from the character's facial expressions to their body language it's all done masterfully. The backgrounds are as impressive from the smallest leaf to the largest river they're all done in incredible detail. The movie is definitely creative, there are little glowing clicking beings (I forget what they're called), also the NightWalker is a most fascinating creature. With the plot, you might think it's over, but then BAM something changes. Also, what some call the ""boring"" parts are to build the characters, plot, and frequently give hints on what's going to happen next. As I said earlier, I think it leaves us wondering why we're doing what we are doing to the environment. The dubbing, well, it isn't necessarily bad, but let's face it no anime's dubbing is particularly memorable. So, all in all this is an Anime classic please, do yourself a favor and watch Princess Mononoke.",1006387200,30,1861,4.642424242424243
1324751,5,B00003CXBK,"Hayao Miyazaki does not disappoint in this latest movie that confirms again he is the Grand Master of animation, Japanese or otherwise. The art is gorgeous and the themes of Man and Nature, as in Nausicaa almost 20 years ago, are even more profound today.
My only complaints are there are a few too many characters and that makes the story slightly confusing. This requires careful attention by the audience. The title character does not have as strong a presense as Nausicaa, Sheeta and Pazu from Laputa, or Kiki. Still this is a strong film from a wonderful film maker.",1006300800,,571,4.72

The art & animation is nothing short of amazing, the charactors are very interesting and...well you'll like all of the charactors weather they are good or evil. And wait till you see the lighting fast animation, I mean it's...it's...incredible! And the plot will keep you going till the credits, it's about this dude who gets cursed and this girl...well I don't want to give away any of the plot really, because that's the whole movie. So I did't get to see this movie in theaters but I got the VHS, and the VHS totaly RULED even tho I had to watch it on my 25in color TV!!!
The Voice actors:
This movie has an outstanding cast of voice actors featuring, Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudrup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith and Billy Bob Thornton...
Animation:
Well what can I say about the animation??? Other than it's totaly kick butt to the end!!!
So if you like Anime or even if you don't like anime than get this movie! It's the best movie that you'll ever see.

1324822,5,B00003CXBK,"I'll admit it. I've never liked anime, even before it became the craze it is now. When I heard about Princess Mononoke, I just shrugged it off and rolled my eyes. Gradually, as I began to hear more about it, I developed a curiousity for it. When I heard it was playing on Starz, I decided it would be a good chance to try it; after all, it was free.
-This movie blew me away.- The animation is superb (being an animation major in college, I'm picky about those things), the storyline interesting, and every shot was beautiful. My younger sister and I originally were watching it to make fun of it (as we do with many anime shows and movies) but we ended up loving the movie far more than we ever imagined. I loved the movie for the animation and the storyline (I am very into earth-based spirituality) and my sister loved the characters, especially the little Kodamas (tree-spirits)
If you're looking for a serious, inspirational animated movie, then look no further. Princess Mononoke is all that and much much more. I'm glad I ""forced"" myself to watch it that one time, otherwise I would have missed out on one of the greatest movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.",1005004800,4,1175,4.4953271028037385

1324824,2,B00003CXBK,"Surely most people are fans of Miyazaki's works because of Nausicaa, Laputa, Kiki, Totoro.  That's because even though those films appear ""less ambitious"" than Mononoke Hime they moved you emotionally, spiritually.  Unfortunately that's missing from Mononoke.  I can't buy into the argument that since there is no side you cheer for that this is more realistic=great.  That doesn't make it great.  And it's certainly not what made Miyazaki's previous works so enjoyable.  Maybe I expected too much but even that put aside I didn't experience the same emotional charge and sense of wonder as I did when watching Laputa or Nausicaa.
Even the ending was disappointing.  There was no real resolution to the conflict.  We didn't really learn much about anybody except how much Rage can cloud their judgements.  The story line wasn't very memorable.  I can't even remember the soundtrack.  (astonishing considering Jo's past accomplishments in previous works).
It's unfortunate since this was Miyazaki's first real big exposure to the US audience.  The fact that it only grossed a bit over $2 Million in the US has endangered future realeases of his films by Disney.  Write them and tell them that would be a very big mistake ...",1004400000,,1223,5.085427135678392
1324825,5,B00003CXBK,"This is an amazing anime feature reminding me a little of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Except that was Chinese Folklore). It has simplistic yet very professional and detailed animation by Hayao Miyazaki. Featuring a beautiful instrumental score rendered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. This movie is set in isolationist Japan, and is filled with eastern/Japanese cultural elements for us westerners to attempt to understand. Along with a decent fantasy helping of personified animals and Gods. Be careful watching it if you can constitute a western audience member. This isn't a tree hugger movie like Fern Gully (me shudders). If you think this movie has contemporary western political motives then you are thinking too hard! I had to stop myself and just enjoy it. The story really has no antagonist because both sides in the story are equally guilty of one emotion (try and find the best line in the movie that sums up what I just said)...plus it smacks of Eastern values and mythology. And that's all I'm going to say about the story. If a devout conservative can love this movie...anyone can. Leave the soap box at home. Incidentally the english dub features the voices of American Hollywood stars such as Gillian Anderson (The X-Files)and Billy Bob Thorton (Armageddon, Pushing Tin, etc...)...But don't tell the real Anime buffs that I watched it dubbed...lol...I know only real anime fans watch subbed anime.",1003795200,12,1423,5.137931034482759

 The animation in this movie is awesome. It`s greatly drawn fast moveing and very realistic. The sound is unbalivable. The voice actors are great and sword clashing and so on is great too.
 The fight scenes are perfect. The only problem is that they are short. But theres lots of them.

1324827,5,B00003CXBK,"This fast-moving, inspiring animation is really a new art form. Miyazaki takes animation to a new level by weaving philosophic debates about human excesses in uses of natural resources with fantastic battle scenes, romance and honor. The animism of Japanese religions comes to life in the form of great animal Gods as they compete with humans for space on the planet. But like other Japanese productions, no one is protrayed as truly evil and there are no ""guys in white."" The boar God is portrayed as stubborn and the would-be evil woman shows compassion to leppers. Overall, the movie makes not so sublte statements about a mulitude of social subtlies.
A great piece of work and a great way to learn Japanese.",1001980800,2,711,4.836065573770492
1324828,5,B00003CXBK,"I've been getting a strange feeling lately that sometimes the obviously unreal world of animation can seem almost more real. Sure you won't find two tailed wolf-gods and giant talking pigs in this world, such as exist in Princess Mononoke's world, but seldom have I felt more emotion that ring as true as this in those real actors movies. This is a movie very much in the mindset of when we believed that animals were gods and everything had a mystery and spirit. Its a world of living breathing mythology. At first the story seems a little odd. But if you just free your mind and go with it...it really grows on you.
This is a bigger movie...this maybe is what the pioneers and visionaries of the early days of films, would have thought of were movies would go. This is not a Disney movie. It doesn't at first appear to be obsessed with Disneys detailed fluidness. But it is very detailed and leaps and bounds above most movies in maturity, drama and vision. This movie dreams its own dream. There just aren't many movies like this out there. The second time I watched this I got it...and I just can't let go of it. You must experience this movie.",1001721600,,1148,4.4714285714285715

The animation is incredible with sweeping vistas and awesome special effects.  Very nice.  The story is based a lot on man vs nature and has lots of hidden story lines.  Great for the hardcore fan but probably too much for younger kids.  There are some pretty graphic scenes which I love but may be inappropiate for the younger crowd.  Nicely done and a great adventure.",1000944000,,474,4.517647058823529
1324885,5,B00003CXBK,"I have already written a review on this incredible movie, but I accidentally made it a private review.  Over time, however, it made me furious to find 1-star reviews here, and so I decided I should write another review.
The theme of this review is that ""Princess Mononoke"" is NOT an average Disney cartoon by any means.  It's very different for a variety of reasons.
1) The storyline.  No 5-year-old kid could ever understand the storyline to this film.  It's about a young prince who was cursed by a demon that attacked his village.  After he killed the demon, the prince discovered that the curse is a curse of hatred that comes from the west.  He must go and stop the evil that is going on in the west, to ""see with eyes unclouded by hate.""  Otherwise, the curse will kill him.  The rest I leave to you, but the basic point is that the flim is about love and hate, joy and sorrow, and human life and death.
2) The dialogue.  The script in this film is truly unforgettable, with quotes like: ""You cannot alter your fate my prince, however you can rise to meet it if you choose"", and ""Now watch closely everyone, I'm going to show you how to kill a god.  A god of life and death.  The trick is not to fear him.""
3) The violence.  Yes, there is enough violence in this film to merit a PG-13 rating, and although an arrow doesn't NORMALLY chop arms off, it just goes to show that when hatred takes over someone, it can really make them crazy.
4) There's no real ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"".  Although San wanted to protect her forest, she and her wolves also killed the husbands of many of the women in Irontown.  And although Lady Eboshi wanted to destroy the forest for iron, she also cared for the lepers of Irontown and was very loving to her people.  And the prince doesn't side with either one of them, he just wants to make peace so his curse will be removed.
5) The length of the film.  It is 134 minutes long.
6) The animation.  It is absolutely incredible.  It took three years to create this film, and they were not wasted.  The Nightwalker is absolutely an amazing sight to behold!  And when the prince entered the magical forest, he said, ""This place is magical.""  I said the exact same thing.  I forgot I was watching a cartoon.  I forgot I was watching a movie.  I even forgot my own name.  It was that breathtaking!  (Oh, and by the way, the dubbing was done along with RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match the English language!)
Bottom Line: If this STAGGERINGLY good movie ISN'T so good that it makes you forget everything as you watch it, then my name isn't....uh....uh....uh....",1000684800,,2598,4.39412997903564
1324886,5,B00003CXBK,"I enjoy animation, especially when the art in it has been pushed to the nth degree.  Hubby is a hard convert though.  I did get him to watch this film though and he hasn't liked an animated film this well since I got him to watch Bashki's ""American Pop.""  So we have two five star votes for this film.  It is legend oriented, set in a forest with spirits, rulers, warriors and so forth.  The animals all talk too and are key characters as well.  The story is engrossing but probably not any more so than a really well done fairy tale.  Where it pulls out all the stops though is the artistry that goes with the storytelling.  The art work of the forest spirit alone is absolutely incredible and that is hardly the only thrilling moment.  I saw ""Shrek"" this past summer and in my mind there is no comparison between the two films.  I enjoyed ""Shrek"" but I loved this film.  It is not for small children though as it is violent and there is a lot of mayhem and blood.  Probably ""American Pop"" still is in No. 1 position for me with animation because of the more sophisticated story line but ""Princess Mononoke"" certainly has #2 position firmly locked up now.

First of all the english voice over cast sucks. After watching this I'm sure the only word Gillian Anderson can put any emphasis on is ""Mulder!"".The story starts strong and the character's spreading ""infection"" seems promising toward a strong ending,But I was dissapointed. If your looking for intense,against the odds action scenes,go elsewhere. There were very few fighting scenes and the character refuses to use his ""infection"" to fight.

But, really, the dubbing is actually rather good. Some casting choices were a little off, such as Claire Danes as the voice of San (please! Who thought of THAT one?), but otherwise, it's just fine. I'd highly recommend this movie for any fan of Miyazaki Hayao (the director) or anime in general. Even if you aren't normally an anime fan, try it anyway.

The animation is good but very unoriginal. How many times have I seen worm like monsters invading human bodies in Japanese animation? It seems like Japanese animation MUST have one of those scenes.
It seems the movie creator is trying to spread its shinto/shaministic religious beliefs, which is one of the reason why the movie is so incoherent to the western mind.",998092800,,627,5.038461538461538

This is the way every anime should be brought to DVD. An excellent cast of actors was used, although some will complain about how well these actors fit the parts, I think you have to accept that the English actors will have to be somewhat  different if you go for big names and this doesn't necessarily make them worse. The script was translated very well and was rewritten in some places to account for cultural differences, resulting in one of the most natural and understandable english versions. The soundtrack to this movie also shines, featuring some simple but beautiful melodies and a mostly western classical score with some integration of eastern instruments.
The visuals are the best you will see in an anime released in the US, period. Smooth, vibrant animation, some CG tricks and gorgeous depictions of the nature that the story takes place in.
The DVD also has a few extra features: an interview with the cast and the trailer. The English and Japanese versions of the audio also correspond with the video in places where there is text onscreen, so if you pick Japanese audio, you will see the credits in Japanese, etc.",998006400,5,1389,4.910638297872341

1324940,5,B00003CXBK,"I initially avoided seeing ""Mononoke"" is theaters, not because it was animated (far from it), but because it looked a little too artsy for me. At the time, the only anime I cared about was brainless ninja stuff with super powers. But after seeing the DVD, I'm kicking myself for not experiencing this on the big-screen. In a weird sort of way, the story is actually more political than theological, even with the gods and demons and talking animals.
This is the kind of movie that should really be held up as a shining example of Japanese animation.  It has a beautiful story, realistic characters, and a great mix of cell and computer animation. Even the English voice cast was terrific, which is something I almost never say. It also doesn't hurt when the original script is adapted by comics legend Neil Gaiman, who has a real respect for the work.
It's unfortunate that ""Mononoke"" wasn't as big a success over here as it was in Japan (where it was narrowly beaten out by ""Titanic"").

1324941,5,B00003CXBK,"This film has a lot to offer.  The story, which begins seemingly prototypically as a maturation story, somehow entwines us into a world of interwoven morals and sadness.  It tells of that age when the world lost its innocence and simplicity and became victim to the complexity of human existence.  It seems almost to reflect back sadly on the day that mankind began to treat nature with ambiguity, respectful of its beauty and wonder, yet pragmatic in recognizing the resources it contained.
The story is very sharp and (save for some early scenes of violence) not at all stereotypical.  There are only a few characters that we view as having a certain moral turpitude, most of the main characters instead being utterly human in their ways and actions.
The dialogue is profound at times, light and entertaining at others.  It seems to be more philosophical and sophisticated than the dialogue we would expect from modern characters, because perhaps the world is not yet so pragmatic.
The artwork is spectacular at times, mostly due to the creativity and wonder that the director has infused into it.  What we see is a world that we afterwards long for, particularly serene settings deep in the forest.",996883200,,1201,4.891625615763547

The movie cleverly weaves a number of Japanese fairy tales/fables together.  I personally liked the Japanese sounds tack a lot better than the English.  And for those wondering what the translation of the Hime is.. it goes:
In the moonlight I felt your heart, Quiver like a bowstrings pulse. In the moon sphere light you looked at me. Nobody knows your heart.
When the sun has gone I see you, Beautiful and hunting but cold, Like the blade of a knife so sharp so sweet. Nobody knows your heart.
Lord of your sorrow, grief and plea, Locked away in the forest of the night. The sacred heart belongs to the world, Of the things that sigh in the dark, Oh the things that cry in the dark.

Although there is a lot of violent conflict between the humans and the 'spirits of the forest', most of the characters are only doing what they think is best for their own kind.
The English dubbing is the best I've ever seen.  I recommend that the viewer also watch this movie with the original Japanese dialouge and English subtitles.

And the music is fantastic! You get so caught up in the story that you no longer care wether they mixed computer animation with animation or not. I am glad it was animated because it wouldn't have looked as cool as a live action film. They couldn't have gotten the Spirit of the Forest to look so cool at the end if it wasn't animated!

When he is cursed by a demon, he must leave his people in search of the spirit of the forest. He finds himself in the midst of a war between humans and animals. Because the spirit of the forest lives, all the animals think like humans and some are even considdered gods. The humans are led by Lady Eboshi, ruler of Iron Town where women power over men. The animals are led by the wolf gods, including the wolf Princess Mononoke. Mononoke is a human, but her parents left her with the wolves. Instead of eating her, they raised her.

This isn't to say that Anime is bad in any way: however, Anime usually represents a limited base of attention (regardless of how big that limit is) in America at least.  This movie transcends the stereotype of Anime, making it something even greater: this is a legendary movie, no matter how you look at it.
Sadly, a great amount of people would never consider the possibility of an animated film having the ability to move people emotionally.  This is at least one case that they are mistaken in.  ""Princess Mononoke"" is a deeply moving fantasy drama about the events surrounding the beginning of the rifle-style projectile in Japan: an event that shook the very foundations of the society.  Before that time, Samurai were a poor but elite class of warriors.  Now peasants had access to something that could rival the power of the Feudal Elite.  This story addresses, in a very spiritual manner, how deep the changes were to these people through showing the life of a fictitional hero ""Ashitaka"" and his spiritually symbolic soulmate ""San"".

1325127,5,B00003CXBK,"As there are already a lot of excellent customer reviews, I'll only throw in my 2 cents.
This is an excellent blend of action anime with a many-layered dramatic story.  While it is probably too ""adult"" for a pre-teen (graphic violence and the complexity of the characters), it is rare to see any film pack that much ""meaning"" and drama while still having enough visual conflicts to keep the action addicts happy.  There is no black and white in this movie.  There are no ""darkest villians"" or ""perfect heros"".  Just many real people with real emotions, ideals, and prejudices.
The violence may be graphic, but it is not pointless, though it might require a decent knowlege of the martial arts, asian or western, to fully appreciate.  Watch the reactions of the spectators and remember that most people in film have only seen swords and arrows as weapons.  To them, a musket that can fire half-inch diameter ball of iron the same distance as an arrow is a super-weapon.  Then consider a hand-cannon (tiny canon mounted on a stout staff for support and bracing - the first firearms) that fires 2-3 inch diameter solid iron balls, the power of the nature clans, and the power of a demon curse.  No, I'd say the graphic aspect is pretty tame.  I've fired a one inch hand cannon (historical re-creation society - and no, NOT at any person or animal - sickos), so I've seen first hand what they can do.  I'd say an excellent job was done conveying the horror of the conflicts without getting gratuitous or showing what would REALLY happen (Saving Private Ryan for example, which is still watered down).  There may be some scenes that seem like pointless violence (expecially with the English Dub), but you should discover the meanings after watching it several times.  I'm over half a dozen viewings, and I'm still finding subtle nuances I missed.
This is simply an excellent dramatic film with the freedom of visual expression Anime can provide, and boy, does this film provide!  For the greatest ""adult"" enjoyment, see the film in Japanese with the English subtitles (well, short of being fluent in Japanese with a good knowlege of Japanese culture and history, present and ancient - but that's a bit much to ask)
As for the Dubbing - well, considering the prejudices of the US film market and the realities the film buisiness, they pretty much have to ""dumb"" down the English versions to create a wide enough appeal to pay for the English release in the first place, expecially since this was first done in the US as a theatrical release with some expensive talent.  While the English dub definately loses a lot of the drama of the original Japanese, it certainly is not near as bad as 80% of the other dubs I've seen.  As it stands, it is an excellent translation for the general English speaking audience.  And if it gets more people to appreciate Anime and hopefully insipire them to watch it with literal English subtitles, well I consider it a good thing.  As it stands, unless there's a multi-billionare out there who wants to spend a LOT of money to get an accurate English dubbing and the extra treatment a lot of Anime deserves, we'll all just have to settle for a good subtitle job or learn fluent Japanese and sorrow for the countless others who miss the true nature of good Anime.
In short, this is one of the best FILMS I have ever seen.  It's a real shame that the distributors chickened out and haven't marketed it as it deserves.  But, what can you expect from Buena Vista (a.k.a. Disney) since it is so vastly different from their standard ""animation"".  While I can decry about what should have been done, I also have to thank them for making it widely available.

1325130,5,B00003CXBK,"This movie has to get through a lot of barriers to American audiences: it's animated, they think ""kid's stuff,"" and so they automatically think it's stupid and/or are dismayed by the violence (which really isn't all that bad, it's really glossed over, considering the warfare going on). And there's also the environmental message, which makes people roll their eyes.
But Princess Mononoke avoids all the traps and is just an artfully written, beautifully illustrated story with the background of myth and modern-day issues. The film avoids being preachy and just shows what happens when people try to conquer nature instead of being a part of it, as well as showing that the problems the hero faces aren't because of demented evil, but people (or gods or animal spirits, as the case may be) trying to get by and get ahead.
Other notes: there is great voice work in Princess Mononoke (some people complained; they must not watch anime dubs very much) especially by Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi. The dialogue also lacks that bad-translation feel and is actually in synch with the character's mouth movements. (seriously, this is saying a lot). There is no reason why you shouldn't see this movie, unless you need shoot-em-up action, a sappy romance, or predictable comedy to enjoy a film.",992390400,,1286,4.958333333333333
1325131,5,B00003CXBK,"I loved this film. I saw it having seen little or no anime before, and was most impressed. The visuals are absolutely stunning at times and the characters expressively drawn. Not only that, but it has a well-crafted story which bravely avoids the trap of a cliched 'Hollywood' ending where the 'bad guys' get beaten and the 'good guys' kiss and live happily ever after. The characters and factions in the story are much less black and white than pretty much all animation (and live action for that matter) that I've seen. All 'sides' in the central conflict of nature versus technology have legitimate motivations, and all of them also have something to learn. The ending is quite ambiguous (perhaps leaving room for a sequel?), leaving behind the moral that conflicting points of view can exist together without one having to destroy the other.
I only had a couple of gripes. Firstly, I thought the two central characters could have done with a bit more meaningful dialogue to develop them and their relationship. This may be a symptom of the second problem, which was that the English adaptation of the script was a little disappointing. I've only seen the film in English (I'd like to see it in the original Japanese with subtitles, which is possible with the DVD), and I thought the 90s American voices jarred somewhat with the mythic Japanese setting. Some of the voices fitted the characters quite well (Gillian Anderson's character, for example) but others just seemed out of place, like the warrior monk who sounded like Hank off King of the Hill!
However, overall I enjoyed the film very much and appreciated its lessons. It addresses contemporary issues without detracting from its status as an exciting mythic tale.",992044800,7,1726,4.8941979522184305

1325174,5,B00003CXBK,"The mind is boggled, words fail and there aren't enough stars to commend this film. Everything about it - characters, story, animation - makes it one of the greatest movie experiences of all time, animation or not. Just pipping the 2 hour mark, the plot draws on Japanese mythology which, although it may mean more to people more familiar with the culture, can be understood on a fairly universal basis - I won't bore you with details since it's done above. There's no ecological preaching, no clearly-defined good and evil, just a battle between the forces of progress and nature itself, and the bravery of a young stranger who would try to unite them both while fighting for his own life. Perfect acting and amazing animation only strengthens an already powerful experience, plus the DVD quality was quite excellent. Just one point to mention - this movie seems to have set itself up for a sequel, even a series, where the origins of the two young heroes and their continuing relationship are revealed. Finally, I am fairly new to the works of Studio Ghibli (I may have seen some of their other stuff aeons ago but nothing's available here in the UK - WHY?), yet I can quite confidently say that their animation is the greatest of anime and at least the match of Disney's best efforts. They are not the Japanese Disney though; their smaller number of creations are infinitely more diverse and full of the magic the best of Disney contains but a spark of(that spark seems to have died out since the classic Lion King).  Weary of flat Hollywood efforts, bored of slushy romances and endless films about Brit drug culture? Well I'm confident there's any number of countries can produce better films than the US of A, but why not start here?

While they don't use all the computor animation Disney uses, he (The artist. Can't remember his name.) managed to make the art work breathtaking. (Well, not really.) And this movie would have a 'R' rating if not for the lack of cursing. So pay attention to the rating parents. Not all *Ahem* 'Cartoons' are for kids.

For being dubbed in english, the movie was incredible when compared to many other anime titles that were brought to the states.  Now for the down side.

I feel that this film has been sadly overlooked because it's just dismissed as kid's stuff. I've heard complaints from parents about the film's violence, but that problem could have been solved by looking at the PG-13 label on the DVD. Even though the film comes close to 3 hours, that's the way Japanese story telling is. The reason why I recommended this to anyone interested in the Japanese culture is that they know that the Japanese like long drawn out stories and us Americans want the movie to get to the point. This movie also has a lot of symbolism so watch out for that. This movie was so moving that I actually cried at the end. This is a must-see...",987897600,3,823,4.5675675675675675

I agree with those who consider some of the voice acting to be out of place. The accents do sound strange and often the characters shout their lines which seems very contrived, awkward and unnecessary. The producers should have eschewed big name movie and television stars in favor of genuine professional voice actors. But often, the english version of the script is at fault. Many of the character's lines are downright corny. Indeed, the entire movie is excessively melodramatic, causing me to almost cringe. For instance, the scene where wolf girl has to chew the food for the hero is really too much. Like I said, the Japanese version is probably much better but I suspect the plot is still too convoluted. I think they tried to do too much with the story to its overall detriment. Overall I found the film disappointing and would not recommend it.",987552000,7,988,4.716763005780347

You do not know what real anime is until you enjoy the spectacular backgrounds in this.
Many of them look like they're real, and I can assure you that you cannot come CLOSE to drawing something as spectacular as those.
Now, about the rest of the movie. A wonderful plot-line based loosely on Japanese mythology. The characters are well-written and have some very excellent dialogue. Some of the voices were the wrong choices, but that's what happens when you dub it. Everything about this movie is nearly perfect, and I cannot give this enough praise.

It's way, way too overlong.  It comes in at about 2 hrs 20 mins, yet so much of the movie is painfully repetitious that this could easily have been trimmed to 80 mins.

Certainly not American mainstream (I think its because the story actually needs brain power to comprehend) but amazingly hit a high note for its American DVD release, especially with critics and fans of anime. Its truly a shame that such a high profile release for both America AND Japan would get such a limited theatrical release here in the states. Because it featured such big-name actors, it might've attracted many theatre-goers.
Anime has an American misconception that its all Child's Play. On both physical and philosophical levels, this is definately not a kid's movie. It has a little violence, but nothing compared to what most animes bring. The story is also a masterpiece in of itself, which sheds an interesting perspective upon war: neither side is in the right. The main character seems to be the screenwriter himself if he truly believes this perspective. The main character serves as the middle-of-the-road type character for many of the conflicts between the 2 sides.
The artwork is astounding. Shadows are cast upon moving characters with a stunning reality, the colors are lush, the picture is clean and crisp, and the characters have a personality all of their own just by their appearance. The lip-synching is wonderfully done, I did not see any ""Godzilla"" type lip-synching, infamous of Japanese movies.

Set in Midevil Japan, A boy named Ashitaka is the last prince of an almost completeley wiped out tribe. When killing a demon god from harming his vilage, he is cursed. He himself will turn into a demon. So he is forced to leave his village and seek out the spirit of the forest. One thing you should know is that all the animals have the power to talk. But if the spirit of the forest is killed, the animals become stupid, as they are today. Ashitaka journeys through a forest and finds two wounded men. He safely transports them to their village of iron town, where he finds the leader to be a woman. Lady Iboshi. The town is always at war with the animals because there is iron in the forest and they are after it. The only way to get it is to cut down the forest and this makes the animals mad. On top of this, the wolves have a human daughter. Princess of the wolves. She enters the village to attack Lady Iboshi, but Ashitaka stops her. He flees with the Princess, but he was shot. Realizing that he is on her side, she takes him to the enchanted part of the forest where the spirit lives. The spirit heals his flesh wound, but does not lift the curse. When the big battle happens against the boars and the humans, the boars loose. One of the boar gods begins to turn into a demon. Princess Mononoke tries to stop it and it begins to change her too. Whats worse is that Lady Iboshi is on her way to kill the spirit of the forest. Ashitaka has to stop it in time and save himself and Mononoke from the curse. The soundtrack is also great.

But with that aside, this is still one of the best english dubbing efforts of all time! Great cast for a great anime classic!
But the Dvd lacks a solid documentary about the process of uncovering this gem! WHy the Disney animators got interested in it? Why this movie took so long to get a theatrical release on the states? All this questions and more are left unanswered.

I was truly surprised by the independence that it shows from any other animated film that I have seen, which is a rather high number, and I think that if or when you see this movie you will be moved and captivated beyond your expectations.

These films seem to be extensions of comic books, and, while flashing beautiful animation, completely avoid the hassle of telling a story.
That said, PRINCESS MONONOKE is NOT your typical Japanese animation. This film tells a simple fairy tale, in a not-so-simple manner.  With excellent action, beautiful renderings, and a complexity of character that few American animations have ever approached, MONONOKE assaults the eyes and mind of the viewer. Even the English dubbings don't get in the way, although I do recommend watching both the English dubs AND the Japanese just to experience the differences.
As much as I have wanted to love this genre, I have never found anything nearly so good as PRINCESS MONONOKE. It is a freakishly well-done exception to the norm, and is, in fact, one of my favorite films. Even if you hate the stuff, see this film.",983145600,13,1007,4.883040935672515

Much of it is trashy, silly, sexually overt rubbish targeting sexually deprived teenage males. I can see why many people steer clear from anything classified as anime. I urge any potential view with these concerns to open your mind and watch this film.
If I could only recommend one Japanese animated film this would definately be it. Hayao Miyazaki is often referred to as the Japanese Walt Disney. If you see his other films (which are all excellent) you can see why, however this film does not fit that role.
Princess Mononoke despite it's fairy-tale-like sounding name is definately not targeting a younger audience. This movie is for adults. While some of the scenes may be a little to strong for children, that's not to say there is anything lewd or obcene in the film, but the story is a drama written for the adult mindset.
I was fortunate enough to see this film in the theatres where I was left amazed and speechless as the credits rolled up. This movie is simply fantastic.

Pretty much all of it (after the DVD release) has been positive, so I won't waste much time on that aspect in this review. All I can say is that it's an amazing movie, and from such a simple, yet intriguing concept. This, as said in other reviews is not Ghost or Akira, but then it's not trying to be, and doesn't need to be in that genre to succeed. This is a film which at first seems to follow a standard format, good versus bad, but on closer inspection, and through repeated viewing, the characters seem neither good nor bad, but all viewing the world through their own eyes and so justifying their actions according to their own situations and understandings. All trying to prosper and make the best for themselves with their limited view of the world. Truly it is only Ashitaka who can see the whole picture and attempts to unite the factions under this, to truly bring together the civilised world and the forest like in the past. This is the work of Hayao Miyazaki the same artist who gave us Nausicaa, and the quality and depth of the story shows. In fact anyone who is familiar with Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, will be familiar with this quality of work, and the flow and depth of the story is similar, both in ideas and content. In both stories a lone warrior struggles to better the world for all people. This is not a post-apocalyptic tale, or the story of a civilisation nearing collapse, it's the story of two worlds trying to be reunited through the efforts of the few. This is both an excellent movie and a very good DVD with some worthwhile extras. If you're new to Anime, or if you don't buy another animated titles this year, then please make sure you buy this one. If you think that maybe this is not your thing as it is animated, try to move past that and appreciate the film for what it is. It is not a childs cartoon, it is simply that the Japanese choose to animate most of their features, as in this format the film can become more expressive than in live action pictures.

Mononoke Hime is a true masterpiece, quite different from Miyazaki's previous works because it is precisely NOT aimed at children. I don't want to make any spoilers, so I would only say it's the most intelligent, profound and meaningful story I've never seen on an animated feature (and I've seen and loved Ghost in the shell...). But Miyazaki's philosophy is not expressed by words but by behaviours and actions. Animation is hard work so don't think the filmmaker has added some scenes to ""fill"" the movie. Each scene has a signification (sometimes difficult to understand when you don't know anything about japanese culture and religion).

It is true that there are intense violent scenes and slight gorefests in this movie, but they are relatively brief and not over emphasized.  I do not however recommend eating while watching the last half of the movie :)  The movie's beautiful scenery and lighting effect really draw you into the story.  You forget for a few moments that this is an anime!  I myself am a conservative, so I understand how some people get upset over the environmental theme, but the message is not really screaming at you.  It is played out in a well thought out, complex storyline that portrays nearly every character as both good and evil.  They are not simply bad or good, but both at the same time.  A very well thought out story indeed.  I still warn you that there is indeed a very graphic scene with the pig god as he is consumed by demons, and this film is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.  If you can handle predator or alien though, you can handle this.  I highly recommend anyone to at least give this movie a try.  Try to see past the violence and environmental issues, and focus on the highly entertaining story within.  You won't be disappointed.",981504000,11,1333,4.42798353909465

1325506,2,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke, despite its cast of famous voices, was somewhat of an anime-disappointment in my book. I got together with four friends (2 guys/2 girls), and none of the men liked it. It revolves around the story of a young warrior cursed by a demon god, which ""attaches"" itself to his left arm and gives him ""super-human"" strength. The demon itself was cursed by anger and hatred that the animals felt towards humankind for years of animal/human wars. The animal gods and the humans fought many wars against each other, but their hatred only brought destruction and really stupid fight scenes. There also were happy, kind forest spirits that resembled pokemon and made me think of how kid-like our world has become. They made me laugh for all of two seconds; the most enjoyment I had during the movie. The story moves along sluggishly and some things just happen - not to be profound or intelligent, but rather to fill up space. The curse and demon on the young warrior's arm is a real joke; the thing just looks like a giant, purple jello mold and isn't really scary at all (maybe for a 3 -yr. old). The conflict between the humans and animals comes to a ""thrilling"" conclusion when...well, actually nothing was exciting. The wolf girl, also known as Princess Mononoke, who was neither wolf or human; she was the main girl in the movie and she falls in love with the main warrior guy w/ the jello on his arm - yeah, yeah, yeah. The only redeeming quality is the artwork, but of course, you can find better work in a better anime movie instead of wasting your time on this Disney film. I really think this movie is for touchy-feely girls and younger children, because the action is just a little bit too crazy and over-the-top for people in their late teenage years. Maybe, if I were four years old, then I would have appreciated this children's fairy tale more....",981417600,,1869,4.615615615615615

My wife, who scoffs at cartoons shut me up when I walked in while she was watching it (I had to force her to watch it in the beginning).

1325556,5,B00003CXBK,"PRINCESS MONONOKE is no children's fairy tale. It is in fact, the highest grossing film ever produced in Japan. But it was barely even seen in American theatres, because of a problem we have in accepting anything animated as adult entertainment. But for those of us who have managed to break free of this mental barrier- the reward is great!
Set in medieval Japan during the advent of gun warfare, PRINCESS MONONOKE is a tale of intrigue -featuring vivid mythology and timeless themes. Prince Ashitaka finds himself cursed after defending his village from a vicious demon. As a result, he is banished from his village until he can rid himself of the curse and defeat whatever evil has brought the demon upon them. His quest brings him far from home, to a town where the Tatara clan is quickly growing -thanks to new technology and the guidance of Lady Eboshi. But in their expansion they have devastated much of the great forest around them causing the gods of nature to fight back. Can Ashitaka prevent them from destroying each other?
This is not a simple movie- it is a monumental epic. It is not merely animation- it is a breath-taking masterpiece. Every aspect of this classic film has been given tremendous detail and attention with a fabulous cast of voice actors, Joe Hisaishi's sweeping soundtrack, flawless translation by Neil Gaiman, and of course- the immaculate story and design of Hayao Miyazaki and his team.

The fact that so much technical virtuosity has gone into something like this reflects how completely we've, in our guilt about the supposed despoiling of nature, caved into the ideological agenda of the PC-police, eco-nazi division.  Disgusting message, a ranting diatribe against progress and a hymn to a neo-fascism of anti-technological neo-paganistic recidivism.

The feature beautifully showcases the rich Japanese folklore and religious beliefs upon which it is based.  I recommend purchasing the DVD version and setting your machine to Japanese with English subtitles in order to get the full affect and the nuances of the story that the Japanese to English voiceover missed.  This is a story you enjoy for beauty's sake and for the things it makes you think about, not necessarily because of its characters.  The main theme of the movie ---man's impact on the environment and the abandonment of traditional ways of living---completely overrides the character's substories but somehow it still manages to work.

While the animation and coloring is beautiful, there is an acting issue that I have, the casting of Billy Bob Thronton.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with him, but I could not displace his physical appearance with his character's although his performance is great.

It's a interesting movie; I kept thinking it is the sort of thing that someday machines will create by combining the plots and elements of various films and stories.  If you had a machine that could create animations, and you told it to combine ""Bambi"" with ""Braveheart"" and ""The Hidden Fortress"" it would come out something like Princess Mononoke.  It's an interesting story in that there are multiple protagonists; I suppose if the incidental music were not so extremely reminiscent of Braveheart I might have enjoyed it more.
It's nice that the DVD has both English and Japanese soundtracks but to be a ""keeper"" I think a DVD needs a lot more in the way of additional material.",979516800,,781,4.644927536231884

Not only was the plot amazing and powerful, but the animation was smooth, the characters were drawn beautifully, and the backgrounds were lush and colorful.

1325599,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke has been well reviewed here many times, soI'll keep this as short as I can.  As an animated feature: this ishands down the best that I have ever seen (granted, that's just mypersonal take on things) and I'm an animation fan of just abouteverything - Disney, Anime, claymation (I ""lump"" - bad pun,I know - Aardman Animations in here, i.e. Chicken Run, Wallace &Gromit, etc.), you name it.  As a DVD: this is amongst the bestvisual experiences I have seen on DVD.  I'm somewhat biased by my loveof animation, but even so I truly think this DVD can stand up againstmany of the big-bang-DVDs out there (I have things like Gladiator,Independence Day, Fight Club).  The audio is also top notch and I'veenjoyed watching the English dub as well as the original Japanese. The 2 versions really have a very different flow and feel so to fullyappreciate Miyazaki's vision it's necessary I think to see PrincessMononoke in it's original language.  One last note - as others havealso stated, the extras are pretty minimal, but that doesn't reallydetract from this DVD very much.  There are certainly things I wouldlove to have seen included, but I won't even think about complainingdue to the quality of work shown in the transfer and the fact thatthey did finally include the Japanese language track (how many of usreviewing this signed the petition?  I'm glad I did!)  Anyone who hasnot seen this movie (doubtful if you're reading through all thesereviews :) should give Princess Mononoke a try.  Rent it, borrow it,whatever works for you.  I can't really think of anything to comparethis to so you'll just have to watch it in good faith.  All of thereviewers here that have expresses their love of this movie have doneso for good reason - Robert Ebert loved this movie, too.

The music gives great atmosphere and sets a perfect mood for the film. Don't expect an all out blood fest but it does have its share of great action scenes.

There is something horrible and beautiful about nature, and this film shows that in a number of stunning ways.  Man's treatment of nature is more horrible because it is not malicious but ignorant.  While that comment might make the film sound preachy, it's anything but.  It is personal and touching in ways that are difficult to express.  We care about these characters, and they are real.  No one here is truly evil, but their different attitudes and goals bring them into conflict.  The lack of a villian might seem strange to mainstream American audiences, but it is a refreshing change of pace.
Everything about this movie is wonderful, the art, the plot, the characters, the voices, the music.  The DVD is especially nice because it includes the original Japenese language tracks and subtitles, so those who are interested in purity of anime will be happy as well.",978739200,18,1129,4.5721393034825875
1325603,4,B00003CXBK,"Princess Mononoke is a wonderfully animated film; it is clear, very smooth and contains a very effective soundtrack. This quality is consistent throughout, even the voice acting in English was done well; one of the bonus features briefly addressed the difficulty in maintaining the correct verbal pacing with the animation -- the Japanese language having a quicker cadence. The visual perspective is beautifully done, giving a real sense of scale in pull away shots. The story is slightly preachy about nature conservation but not overly so and the ending is honest.
Now, for the reason I give this four stars and not five... personally I feel Miyazaki's Nausicaa story was much better along the same vein (although the English dubbing of Nausicaa was horrendous) and it was difficult for me not to compare the two. In spite of the bonus interviews, I felt that Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver was very good in the role) was not balanced enough makling her resolution at the end a bit disjointed.
It also seemed a hair too long, I know I'll get flack for this especially since I wanted more character development for Eboshi but I did glance at my watch at times and thought perhaps Ashitaka's first entry leading the wounded men into the forrest as well his healing later on could have been slightly abbreviated.
Minor quibbles aside, I am glad to recommend such a quality anime and fine film. As a side note, parents should preview this film as there are some very violent scenes.",978739200,,1476,4.81496062992126
1325623,5,B00003CXBK,"As a 20-year-old man, I often recall in fond remembrance my movie-viewing exploits as a young child.  In those days, I would watch such movies as the Wizard of Oz and Legend with such enraptured attention that it almost felt like the television screen was oozing with the magic depicted within those films.  It was a beautiful feeling to behold, and it is a feeling which I cherish very dearly as a memory from my more impressionable and innocent youth.  However, as time progressed, such a feeling would gradually dissipate along with my childhood.  I would no longer be enchanted by films that I had been so readily captivated with in my days as a young child.  Rather, I began to see such films (such as the Wizard of Oz) for what there truly were: simple children's films.  Legend had lost its fairy tale luster as well, as I view it moreso as a cheesy film than a movie of pure magic when I had seen it as a child.  Thus, I began to yearn for a film that would enchant me as an adult as much as I had been enchanted as a child by those aforementioned films.  And in the end, I found my answer in Princess Mononoke.  Mononoke is simply the best film I have ever seen in that it has rekindled those fond memories of me as a child beholding pure magic on the television screen once more.  The movie itself virtually oozes with a miraculously magical atmosphere, and is also a glaring commentary on the ambiguities of good and evil within the human soul, whether it be depicted within the industrially inclined Eboshi or the mystically vocal animal gods who struggle to maintain the balance of nature.  Coupled with stunning animation, art direction and a resoundingly haunting musical score, Princess Mononoke is a magical and riveting example of a true cinematic epic.  It is truly poetry in motion and a crime to dismiss as a mere cartoon.  Hayao Miyazaki truly is a master of his art, as his movie has truly reawakened the long silent child within all who have beheld his animated masterpieces, and Princess Mononoke is perhaps the very pinnacle of the history of cinema, animated or not.

My experiences with the Japanese cinema has been mainly the films of Akira Kurosawa.  But this movie is perhaps the best animated movie I have ever seen.  The story is full of symbolism and is more intelligent than anything to ever come out of Hollywood.  The landscapes were reminiscent of the cinematography of Kurosawa's epics. I particulary liked the way hatred was portrayed, eating inside of you like a plague.  And how, like in real life, there are no true heroes or villians.

The animal gods fiercely defend the forest from any invasion by man and man continues to invent ways to help annex more of the forest by any means necessary.  The animation has some absolutely amazing sequences but has a PG-13 rating for a reason.  Some of the battle and after battle scenes are very gory.

1325631,5,B00003CXBK,"'Princess Mononoke' is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I watch a LOT of movies. It is a hauntingly beautiful film, from the storyline and characterisation to the music to the visual style itself. It deals realistically with human existence and life itself, defying one to pigeonhole characters into simplistic generalisations of ""good"" and ""evil."" Upon absorbing the whole of the story, it is difficult to not have compassion for even the most seemingly selfish characters: it is clear to see that they rob themselves and fail to experience true joy and harmony in their self-absorption.
On a technical basis, I would strongly recommend watching the film with the original Japanese voices with subtitles. The dubbed version lacks a great deal in the translation, and the English voice actors are without exception truly horrid (particularly Billy Bob Thornton, in what will likely be the most incredibly miscast role of his career, whose portrayal is studied to the point of severe irritation).

1325672,5,B00003CXBK,"For those of you who base your judgement and rely on the score you see...don't do it for Mononoke Hime. At this time of this review, the score is currently 4 and a half stars. It should be 5, it really should. Mononoke Hime should not deserve anything less than a perfect score. This anime film is truly a masterpeice that extends its plot and creativeness beyond a human's wildest imaginations. Miyazaki's films are always masterpeices. Mononoke Hime and Grave of the Fireflies are 2 powerful films that stands out the most. If you haven't seen Grave of the Fireflies...then I recommend you to see that one, it's really emotional and a tearjerking story.
What really prevoked and motivated me at the same time to write this review is because of the score. It isn't really a review but more of a message that I'm trying to send out. Because of the ignorant people that swarm the anime community, many fans are sometimes being misinformed. And...it shows here at Amazon...here in the Mononoke Hime Reviews. Sometimes a score suffers and a masterpiece doesn't really get what it deserves is all because of the ignorant people. Well, I suppose 4 and a half isn't bad either but I still feel that it deserves a 5. All of you, the enlightened fans, I'm sure you would give Mononoke Hime a 5 star score...or maybe more:)
I have made my point clear. Mononoke Hime or should I say...Princess Mononoke is an epic anime movie and should not be missed. If you haven't seen it yet...I urge you to buy it and see it.",978048000,2,1503,4.57037037037037

I think my jaw was dropped in amazement throughout most of the 2+ hours of the film. So much so, in fact, that as the movie ended I immediately replayed it over again! The only disappointment I found was with the DVD, specifically the lack of extras included. Other than a very short featurette and the theatrical trailer there are no supplementals. But, again, this is one of the best movies (animated or live action) that I've seen in a long time and it's beauty is captured wonderfully on DVD. Do not miss this film!!",978048000,,697,4.453125

The English version isn't flawless in terms of translation, which can at times be confusing, but I personally enjoy the Japanese language with the English subs anyway for practice. And of course the animation is beautiful and magical and mind-blowing.
I'm a big fan of Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, plus many others not yet released in English by Disney yet) so this one is a must-have.",978048000,,672,4.95575221238938

Everyone liked it, including my dad who thought that he'd hate it. When I showed the DVD version to my friend a few days ago he like it too. The both sited the same reasons, great artwork, and buetiful active backgrounds.

It is by far and away the most beautifully animated FILM (not cartoon) ever made and if this doesn't change your acceptance level of animated films as 'real' movies, nothing will. The story is very mythological in it's aspirations but never loses it's very strong conviction that man and nature MUST co-exist in order for the planet to survive. It's exquisite translation by DC comics scribe Neil Gaiman (of The Sandman fame) helps maintain the deeply emotional and thoughtprovoking nature of the original Japanese script while the voice acting (by the likes of Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thorton, and Gillian Anderson) is perfectly dead-on and expressive. The whole film just shines with high-production values and never - not even for a second - bores the eye. It's bright and colorful enough for the kids to gawk at while adults can immerse themselves in the philosophical aspects of the story and the truly touching love story. I'd dig deeper into the story but I perfer not to. This is one film you should watch knowing absolutely nothing about. Just sit back and allow yourself to be surprised by this truly ingenious and elegant piece of visual art. A masterpiece.",977961600,2,1300,4.86036036036036
1325679,5,B00003CXBK,"I have just watched this movie, and I am writing this review while I'm still full.
This movie is truly uplifting, both content and animation-wise.
It describes the struggle of the creatures of the forest, to save their home, to save the trees and the animals. This struggle is a metaphor of today's industrial age, where man tries to find a balance between continued development, and environment. In my opinion, Mononoke was characterized masterfully, and induces instant sympathy (at least, it did for me).
The animation is superb; if you don't have any anime in your DVD/VHS collection, let this be the representative of the genre. I know I am very proud to own the DVD, which I will always like to watch again.
To borrow a phrase from the movie, ""watch with unclouded eyes"", and it will blow you away.
One last word: this anime is NOT intended for children. It requires a grown-up person to understand it, and quite frankly, I am afraid not even all the adults will grasp the true meaning of this fable.",977961600,3,1006,4.657303370786517

Although I would like the whole world to see this movie I do not recomend it for kids under 10 for fear that parents will go nuts of the, lets call it ""choice of words"" and violence.

Miyazaki has really created magic in this movie. I felt like I was transported to a very special place and that I was privileged to see a very important story unfold. This movie is animation for adults. Not so much for the violent contant, but more for the nuanced manner that the main characters display their beliefs, strengths and foibles. I found that the viewing was rewarding and that this DVD will be repeatedly viewed.",977788800,,584,4.792079207920792

The DVD offers both English, Japanese and French in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. As if that wasn't enough, you can view the Japanese version entirely in it's originality. Even the ending credits are in full Japanese. There are also subtitles for deaf people and subtitles for the Japanese version. Very nice. Other extras include theatrical trailer and a small little production feature which feature interviews with the English cast. The only little down fall I disliked on this DVD was the no-interactive menus. Other than that, this DVD is great. There was no decompresion noises or bleeding colors. Plus, it's in widescreen!

My son, a Totoro junkie, is in the other room, as we have been warned by anime junkies(of which we are not of the club) about the violence of the upcoming event.  Our friends have no kids, and don't know how disturbing a,albeit animated, beheading can be to a child.  Yes, it's a princess Mononoke party.  What a success!!!  My son watched most of it, although we often had to say things like...""oh look the man's head came off...isn't the grass green"".  This is a gorgeous adult film...This director has been called the Disney of Japan, and I am afraid that does him some disservice.  Surely, this film deals in moral ambiguity like Walt dealt in surreal Pink Elephants, but again it seems like a misnomer...the inability for us to accept things for what they are but rather name them some american equivalent>  This is challenging, mystical, beautiful stuff that shouldn't be compared to anything else.  Environmental issues, life and death and morals are all dealt with in a very different way.  This is a film that will stay with you, haunt you, because it doesn't refuse to take a stand, but rather takes many stands, and doesn't back away.

1325697,5,B00003CXBK,"This is not like any Japanese animated movie or any other animated film.  It is not a lost adventure like Pokemon, neither is it a classic cutesy by Disney or Dreamworks.  This is a film that quickly caught my eyes and ears because of its rare beauty and incredibly poignant feelings(I love anything that is poignant and this film is no exception).  I was quickly captured by the story of a young warrior cursed by a demon god.  The demon itself was cursed by anger and hatred it held towards the destructive humans.  The animal gods and the humans fought many wars against each other, but their hatred only brought destruction to themselves.  There also was the forest spirit who brought both life and death, and could give life to some, but death to others.  The whole story I found to be gripping and thrilling.  The curse, that evil hating curse that could eat people and animals alive.  The conflict between man and beast that did not have to happen.  The wolf girl, San, also known as Princess Mononoke, who was neither wolf or human.  And the mysterious forest god of life and death, pain and relief.  One thing that distinguishes this move from others is that no one is a good guy or a bad guy.  Just about every person has good and evil in them, but hate and anger can infest and destroy anyone.  I have never known of a more captivating movie.  The animation was beautiful and not over done, but very simple and artistic.  The gore and violence is hard to stomache, but it brings more poignant feelings to the viewer.  The music is also very beautiful and ethereal(some might say it sounds very ""Enya-like"").  There is absolutely no reason why you should not see this movie.  If you think, ""oh, it's just an ordinary Japanese movie"", or ""Oh, it's not as great as it sounds"", you're wrong!

The DVD is a must-buy!  It doesn't contain many extra features, but does that matter?  Once you hear Mononoke in Dolby Digital and see it in anamorphic widescreen, you will realize it's well worth the money.

1325739,5,B00003CXBK,"Wow.  I first saw Princess Mononoke during its limited theatrical release (twice).  Many people have issues with the dub, but this is by far the best dubbed anime ever to be released -- I, like most anime fans, normally insist on subtitles, but Neil Gaiman and the cast succeeded in putting real emotion into these characters.  The casting of Billy Bob Thornton and Claire Danes might rub some ears the wrong way, but in my opinion the emotional impact is still there regardless of the odd accents.  In any case, the Japanese track is included, and it's phenomenal.  As for its content, most arguments about its violence and length can be dismissed by viewing it as a film, rather than as a cartoon.  It's not Disney.  The plot is a complex and delicate exercise in shades of gray.  Don't expect Akira or Macross either -- it's really not of the same genre.
The video and audio quality is the sort that you would use to show off your new home theater system.  In fact, I found the Japanese soundtrack to be richer and better dynamically balanced than the English track (!).  Disney/Miramax really took advantage of the format by including BOTH the Japanese and English opening titles and credits -- they are automatically selected depending on your choice of language via an angle switch.  Transparent and ingenious.  There are two sets of subtitles -- one for the English track, and the other is the literal translation of the Japanese (since some liberties were taken in creating the English script).
Disney was originally going to release ""Mononoke Hime"" without the original language track, which created an outrage among anime fans (who, myself included, signed a massive internet petition which eventually turned the tide).  I applaud this decision, as well as the splendid attention to detail.  It has made this incredible movie an even better value.",977184000,393,1857,4.872611464968153
1325740,5,B00003CXBK,"Generally I dislike Japanese anime films.  I suppose this is due more to my own misinformation about the genre as well as the incomprehesible success of the Pokemon phenomena and its ilk.  However there are two anime films that I have included on my personal list of truly great cinema; the first is Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war film ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and the second is Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"".  The film contains some of the most impressive and visually stunning images in an animated feature (or even a live action film for that matter) that I have seen in a very long while.  But make no mistake, this is no family fun Disney film.  The story and its themes are quite complex and you will have to have an above average attention span to fully appreciate it (a little background in Japanese mythology couldn't hurt either).  While I have a long ways to go before I could call myself an anime fan, films such as ""Princess Mononoke"" have demonstrated to me what the genre is capable of and I look forward to seeing other films by Mr. Miyazaki and other filmakers of his caliber.",977184000,2,1103,4.630769230769231

But there are some parts of the movie that do tend to be boring.  Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, but it does have its slow parts where it has the viewer shouting, ""get on with it!""  Also the translation is great, but there are some weird moments where you just have to go ""huh?""  I don't want to ruin the movie, so I'm not going to put any examples.  I also want to let the squeamish people know that the violence in the movie is no where near ""saving Private Ryan"" range.  There's some cutting off of some limbs, but the animation makes it more humorous than sickening.  All in all, Princess Mononoke is a keeper for the many Anime fans out there.  For the non-anime fans, try renting it first, before actually making a purchase.  Oh yeah!  Also before watching the movie, I had extremely high expectations, that maybe the reason why I found some parts of the movie boring.  That's all I have to say.",976924800,2,1043,4.436842105263158

Anime was not huckleberry hound or mickey mouse or something lame like that.  Anime was action filled and it had a storyline that keeps you glued to the screen.  This was animation for the thinking person, anime brings to life what may sometimes be difficult to play live action.  Also, this reads like a powerful comic book.
Back to Princess Mononoke, I am thoroughly impressed by this production.  The Mythicism and Magic that this film invokes is priceless.  I was at awe watching these beasts...  I was enthralled as to what will happen next.  And the whole rollercoaster ride is what it really is...  a powerpacked punch that is riddled with Imagination.

Well, guess what, it actually does.  I wish people would wait to get the FULL details about the special features of a DVD before they bad mouth it all over the internet!  It even comes with English subtitles for those who want to hear it in Japanese but still want to read along (an example of that would be me).  Next, is there too much violence in the movie or is it too weak?  The only true violent scenes are at the beginning of the movie or close to the end.  While there are much more gruesome movies, why would anyone want more?  Is that how sick society has become.  Frankly, I think there is just enough amount of violence to make this movie truely interesting (although, I wouldn't show this to young children, just to protect their own innocence).  What is this nonsense about Princess Mononoke being called a ""chick flick""?  Yeah, sure, you can go see it with your girlfriend, but I wouldn't call it a chick flick.  I first saw it with a lot of my friends and we all loved it (for your own information, I am a guy)!  This movie is full of action, which I would think any guy would like.  The animation is amazing.  The plot is well thought out.  Plus, it's a little educational.  I learned a little about acient Japanese beliefs.

Hayao Miyazaki has once again made a masterpiece, much like his acclaimed graphic novel Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  Those who critize this film are those who have no appreciation for beautiful animation and a creative plot, which lacks much of the violence that other anime thrives on (there are a few scenes of violence in Mononoke).  If you are an anime fan that needs excessive violence and action in an anime, then this is not for you.  However, for those who enjoy a movie for its plot and characters as well as its animation, then by all means see this anime.

Animation was great, action was great, but as for plot and storyline progression, it felt a little slow to me. The movie could be better if it was 20 minutes or so shorter. The english dub version is great (for anime dubs, that is), and the quality of the dub is hard to find in any anime anywhere.

1325805,4,B00003CXBK,"Okay, I was pretty impressed. I've come to dread a lot of these films, thinking they would be ruined by the time they made it to America. Princess Mononoke is about as clear a foreign vision as I've seen on video for quite a while.
I haven't watched the original version, and I'm not close enough to Japanese culture to say that I would understand it in its original context. That said, I think the translation, and ""adaption"" work did a pretty decent job of explaining the key plot points for a very complex story, and the voice work also blended in well -- Billy Bob Thornton's southern accent may have seemed out of place, but that was appropriate given the character of the monk.
The animation, a little rough at parts, is mostly stunning throughout, especially the character work. My only real objection to this movie is the overblown (beyond climactic)ending, a problem I also had with Akira.
Finally, there's some pretty grisly violence in the battle scenes, so this is probably not appropriate for most children.",975024000,2,1020,4.735955056179775
1325848,4,B00003CXBK,"Yes its a masterpiece, but it has its flaws.  The storyline doesn't flow as coherently as I had hoped, its a little disjointed in places, with a few moments which were a bit slow and tedious, but the brilliant animation was enough to make up for it.  The themes of nature vs. human progress (on the brink of an industrial revolution here) is frighteningly similiar to reality, only our forests on earth do not have animal spirit-gods to protect them.  Their leader is a girl who believes herself to be a wolf - who is of course Princess Mononoke, raised by wolves and befriended by the wolfgods, she is the link between the human race and the mysteries of the forest.  There is the bad guy (in this case a woman), Lady Eboshi, who is spookily similiar to the antagonist in Hayao Miyazaki's other work, the spectacular ""Nausicaa"" (or ""Warriors of the Wind"" as was its title in the US). In fact, the whole movie is like a modern (or less modern) retelling of Nausicaa with a few new trappings.  The enviromentalist themes are all intact only this time there's no demon summoning, although a few boars get turned into them.
Which leads me to a point.  I know ALOT of people in the United States especially are not familiar with anime tend to believe that animation = children fare.  Well this is not the case, anime is generally slanted for an adult audience, most often in very extreme cases, with R rated themes.  They are basically hard core sci fi or fantasy but set with moving drawings instead of live action.  The PG-13 rating is there for a reason.  This movie is violent, it is bloody, there are boars with their flesh rotting off, beheadings and other acts of violence.  But its not gratitious, there is reason behind it, this movie attempts to make many points on many levels and instead of just talking about it often gives us the visual images to go along with the message. It's entirely necessary and even made me a little queasy at times, but was more than worth it.  Children 12+ should be able to handle it if they are mature enough, although just the ideas of animals turning into demons by their inner hatred can be confusing, again its making a point that violence is not the way to go and that problems can be solved with other ways than falling back on the savage core of the living - which is hate.
Of special note is Ashitaka's steed, a gazelle, who moves with such fluidity and grace, that everytime they take the screen together, I can't take my eyes off of them.  It's gorgeous watching it leap and bound across the screen, very well done.
Overall ""Princess Mononoke"" comes highly recommended as a landmark in Japanese animation, however falls under the bar that was set by ""Nausicaa"" back in the 1980s.  Few movies have managed to eclipse that one in general but it still stands as the best of Miyazaki's work.  Anime fans have probably already seen it and loved it but parents beware that start to reach for the film based on Miyazaki's kid's fare like the often annoying ""Totoro"" and the sweet witch's fantasy ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", that this is particular flick takes a much more mature direction and the real anime fans are thankful for it.",974851200,7,3173,4.551845342706502
1325849,5,B00003CXBK,"First of all, this movie is a must-have. But the reason I'm writing this review is to clarify as to what is an anime film. ""Guardianangel"" includes Mulan when he/she compares other ""anime"" movies he/she has seen, showing a misunderstanding in what is an anime flick. Mulan's not anime, its american animation. The term anime applies ONLY to japanese animation (sometimes called japanimation, also), so you can scratch all disney, WB, or dreamworks animated films as being ""anime"". There is also the misunderstanding as to what extent anime movies go. Because what we see in america is mostly pokemon, dragonball z, sailor moon, etc., this gives the wrong impression as to how good and serious the anime films can be. In Japan, animation is both for kids AND adults (mononoke being an example), so you get both dragonballz (for kids) and princess mononoke(not for kids). Other great anime films that I highly recommend are ""ghost in the shell"", ""ninja scroll"" and ""akira"" (none of them for kids). Oh, and regarding the ""japanese version"" of mononoke, i have only seen the jap version, but i think that the movie released in the U.S. is only a translation, i don't think it was changed, at least not much.

1325850,5,B00003CXBK,"When I first viewed this movie, it was an Internet fansub, burned onto a simple 650 MB CD-R. Even though the quality of the format was terrible, the absolutely stunning animation shone through. The script was translated by fans and some words had lost their meanings, as did some passages. But the moving story and heavy meaning still shone through. My point is that even in it's lowest-quality form, this movie is on par, if not better than, movies like Akira or Ghost in the Shell.
As a professional production, this anime transferred to DVD with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is going to be the pinnacle of animated film. Any anime fan would do well to pick this one up. If you are and you don't at least watch Princess Mononoke, you'll probably come to feel that you're missing out through the reviews of people like myself.

During this film I couldn't stop looking at my watch and wondering what kind of interesting nightmares this movie would produce. They only thing that kept me in the theater was that I paid ($) per ticket. I went to this movie believing it would be a very interesting tale of a warrior, humans and nature. I expected the film to leave me with some kind of moral making me feel bad for not being an environmentalist. The movie loss all meaning when I was hit with a wave of blood and gore. Not to mention the ""possessed"" boars covered with what appeared to be  moving hamburger meat. The one thing that truly made me want to scream was the sleepy stuff in the blind boars eyes. I found myself pleading with the characters to help the poor guy out and take the sleepy stuff out of his eyes. This movie should be rated R to say the least. One thing that scared me worse then the movie itself was after the movie when a bunch of 7 years olds said they loved the movie and couldn't wait to buy it. I think that fact horrified me the most.

Now, after seeing this, I been dying to know where I can buy a copy of my own.

To do away with the curse, he sets off to find the Great Forest Spirit, the only one who can cure him. He arrives in Iron Town and meets up with Lady Eboshi (voiced by Minnie Driver) who plans on taking over the forest where the gentle spirit lives.

The characters and story are very well developed, and there is no CLEAR cut badguy. 3) Joe Hisaishi did the music. 4) It's a Miyazaki film. 'Nuff said!

1325955,5,B00003CXBK,"I think it has been pretty well established that this is a fantastic  movie, so I'll skip the gushing and try to tell you what makes this movie  great, as opposed to merely entertaining.  First of all, the entire film is  genuinely startling in it's originality, and not something you would ever  see in an American-made film.  Also, it's good to know that although this  movie does have a fair amount of violence in it, unlike most anime films it  isn't all that graphic, (except in one scene at about the twenty minute  mark) and the violence only serves to further the story, and not vice  versa.  It's also interesting to note that this is a somewhat feminist  story.  If you've watched anime before, you probably know how poorly the  female characters are treated.  This one perhaps consciously avoids that,  and actually makes the two major women in the movie figures of authority.  This is not to say that it seems to be going out of it's way; it's just  interesting in retrospect.  Oh, and if you're worried about buying an  English of the original Japanese film, don't worry at all.  Not only do the  mouth movements of the character match the dialogue, but the dialogue  actually feels very fluid, in sharp contrast to most anime translations.  And the voice acting is excellent, especially by Billy Crudup and Minnie  Driver.  All things considered, I can't imagine why anyone who likes  animation not loving this movie.

I'm a huge anime  fan. I love anything from ""Akira"" to ""Nadesico."" So  when my uncle gave my sister a book on the making of ""Princess  Mononoke,"" I found it impossible to keep from reading it. What I read  made me decide that ""Mononoke"" was definitely worth seeing. I  looked up various web sites on it, and decided that I simply had to see it.  This was before the theatrical release, which I of course missed. I have  been waiting for its home video release for 11 months, and had the highest  possible expectations. Tonight, when I finally rented it, I was giddy with  excitement. I was definitely not dissappointed.
""Princess  Mononoke"" is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen, bar  none. ""Ghost in the Shell?"" Don't make me laugh. ""X?""  Not bad, but still can't quite compare. ""Akira?"" Close, but not  quite. Don't get me wrong, the aforementioned films are all very good,  ""Akira"" and ""X"" being favorites of mine. But  ""Mononoke"" is awesome. The animation is brilliant, the story is  brilliant, the entire film is, well, brilliant. It's an example of what all  animation can and should be: thoughtful, intelligent, and complex, with  just enough action to keep anyone from being bored for long. ""Princess  Mononoke"" not only belongs right up there with anime's other  masterpieces, like ""Perfect Blue,"" ""Akira,"" and  ""The Castle of Cagliostro"" (Miyazaki again), but also with the  great masterpieces of film itself, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""
""Princess Mononoke"" is the only movie that has ever left me  sitting on my couch, speechless. You may not realize just how good it is  while you're watching it, but you will later. It has a way of sticking in  your mind. Just try pausing it and walking away for more than five minutes.  It will draw you back.

It follows the journey of a young prince in Japan who is in a clan  being hunted down by the Yamato government regime.  He is attacked by a  demon,  and the wise woman of his village tells him that he must leave and  travel to the West.  Once he does, all Hell breaks loose.

1326002,5,B00003CXBK,"Mononoke Hime is hands-down the BEST fantasy movie I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of Conan and Time Bandits and Star Wars and many others, but  Miyazaki has outdone everyone this time.  Character design, backgrounds and  animation from this film are going to set precedents all over the animation  scene; you can already see Disney grabbing at the cool sub-dappled shadows  effect when they released Tarzan.  Now if only American animation could see  its way to delving into more adult and meaningful themes, perhaps it, too,  would receive such acclaim instead of the spurning it usually gets.
The  occasional splotch of computer animation was a little unexpected and seemed  almost to have been pasted over the rest of the movie in places but such  sequences are few and fairly far between.  There was plenty of other  artistic muscle-flexing going on to make up for it.
Intelligent dialog  was another of the film's many joys.  Though the battle sequences of the  film are good (especially when Ashitaka is defending himself or attempting  to avoid combat) they are not the focus of this world so richly created.  The people are the point of the movie and every character has a distinct  personality, voice and set of morals which govern his or her existence.  The entire cast is a study in shades of gray and though some of them are  clearly not of the highest moral character, neither do they come across and  pungently evil or diabolical.
The script was translated by Neil Gaiman  and follows the Japanese version almost to a T.
As many people already  know, Disney was forbidden to cut a single frame or line of dialog from  this film.  And to that I say ""HURRAH!""  I shudder to think what  might've become of Princess Mononoke if it had been through a grinder like  theirs.
Musically, Mononoke Hime is a masterpiece.  J Hisaishi has  produced an epic soundtrack that fits brilliantly with the images portrayed  in the movie.  The American release is riddled by 30 tracks that chop the  music up into a list that more closely follows the individual scenes while  the Japanese release is a symphonic suite of themes from the film (minus  one or two, including the vocal numbers).
All in all, you CANNOT go wrong  with this movie, even with the violence.  It's a groundbreaking work that  will be one of your all-time favorites before you're even through watching  it the first time.",967680000,3,2388,4.754901960784314

1326004,5,B00003CXBK,"I first heard about this movie on TV, on this program about this art film festival all about Japanese movies, here in Holland (where I live). I got  interested in it then when I saw the few shots that they showed. So when I  found out that they where showing it at the Lowlands festival (witch is  obviously more than a music fest.) I went and see it, and I loved it. I  liked it so much that I went and seen it both the two times that they  showed it (it was a 3 day fest so it did not take up all my time). It was  by far the best anime and probably the best animated movie movie I've ever  seen. The only problem is that it is considered to be more of an artmovie  than a very popular animated movie (like Disney) over here, so I think it  won't be on video here, but we can still hope.

1326005,5,B00003CXBK,"A lot of Japanese animation is baffling to the casual American browser.  It's good eye candy, but never makes much sense, zipping through futuristic  scenes and strange fantasies with nary a pause for breath.  Among these  hyper-caffeinated tales of robots and nubile women, Mononoke sticks out  like a chicken at a penguin convention.
Think ""Dances With  Wolves,"" only more epic in scope and universal in theme.  Beautifully  drawn and animated, Princess Mononoke explores the giant forests of feudal  Japan and the effect of civilization on old gods.  For 133 jaw-dropping  minutes, Hiyao Miyazaki draws you into a complex tale that eschews the easy  answers and obvious heroes and villains that Americans expect from  animation.
If you can't get your head around the idea that this is a  serious cartoon, think of it as an Oscar-caliber live-action script, forced  into animation because the special effects budget would have been too high.  That should get you past continental prejudices enough to lose yourself in  the beauty and power of Miyazaki's imagery.
Bring your attention span and  your brain, and don't miss this movie. You'll kick yourself for missing it  in its limited theatrical release.",967507200,24,1206,5.1875
1326006,5,B00003CXBK,"When I first went to see this movie I was skeptical, due to the minimal advertising, but my worries were swept away as I was introduced to the most  spectacular japanese animated film I have ever seen. Strong themes of the  struggles between man and nature, and the confused conflicts of man vs man  propel the amazing story in this movie. The animation is superb, the music  intense, and those forest spirit Kodama's are just so cool!
The film can  get a tad gory at times, but fear not, there is strong substance to this  film. Rampaging boar gods, and ruthless samauri factions, confronting each  other, to the backdrop of an industrial revolution threatening the  remaining primevil forests of ancient Japan create a powerful formula for  this film.
Perhaps the thing that I found most compleling about it, was  the reluctance the story had of identifying the true enemy of the film. You  are not forced to agree with the bad guy vs. good guy scenerio that is so  often forced upon us. You are left to form opinions of your own, and  although you realize it's just a story, it leaves you with thoughts that  can remain relevant so long as there's conflict in this world.
I  anxiously count off the days until the DVD release, and you should too! One  of the best animes ever, hands-down. Buy this movie.",967248000,,1307,4.593073593073593

I, for one, have  been an anime fan for a while now, and this is a supurb example of the  beauty of Japanese animation.

The characters are well thought out, they are  neither cold-blooded, no-good-inside bad, nor happy, never-does-wrong good.  Miyazaki does an excellent job of mixes good and evil in this film.  The  movie i admit is somewhat hard to follow, and seeing it twice will much  better help your understanding.  The moral is a great one, which i will not  give away.  The animation in itself is excellent.  I suggest this film to  anyone who likes down-to-earth yet fantasy movies.

1326062,5,B00003CXBK,"After years of Hayao Miyazaki's work, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime) has been one of his best one.  Actually, all of his work never disappoints the majority of his audiences.  This film is one everyone must see. Of  course, Princess Mononoke story is originaly written and created by Mr.  Hayao Miyazaki.  It took him 13 years of thinking and planning/sketching  and 4 years of working on the film production.  The animation is  astonishing, despite the fact it is traditional classical animation style  viewers are still inspired tremendously.  The music is incredible as well.  Jou Hisaishi has done it again!  He uses traditional instruments from Japan  and China to mix with the symphony instruments.  You can feel as if the  story is coming alive and taking you into its world of the 13th century of  southern Japan. I strongly suggest everyone to see it.  Children under 13  may not understand the theme and story, however, they will grow.  The film  is breathtaking and unforgettable.  You don't have to be Japanese or  Chinese to understand the story plot and culture, the film introduce the  culture to you.",963792000,2,1119,4.961956521739131
1326063,2,B00003CXBK,"Let's face it:  anim, like sushi, is an acquired taste.  I went to see this one because it drew solid reviews in the U.S., and because I happen to believe that all good films have certain storytelling elements in common,  regardless of genre:  strong characters, a well-crafted story, and pace, to  name a few.  PRINCESS MONONOKE nails the first one, falls short on the  second, and fails miserably on the third.
Let's start with the good  things:  first of all, the animation is beautiful.  Every hand-painted  frame of this film is clearly the work of an artist and a perfectionist.  Three of the main characters form an intriguing psychological triangle--the  young, heroic Ashitaka, the mysterious San (who is also the title  character), and the icy Lady Eboshi.  Early on, the quality of the artwork  and the appeal of the personalities involved fooled me into thinking that I  was watching a great adventure film.
Then the story went on.  And on.  And on.  I must have memorized every distinguishing mark on my watch from  checking it so many times.  Look, I don't mind an intricate storyline; I  happen to be a big fan of gratifyingly complex plots.  But a GOOD complex  plot has craft, coherence, and shape; it also has a clear sense of where  it's going, and it doesn't bore you to death as it's trying to get there.  PRINCESS MONONOKE isn't content with 90 minutes' worth of material; no,  anything less than epic scale would be unacceptable.  Unfortunately, it's  so heavy-handed and self-indulgent, so lacking in any sense of narrative  structure, that it feels remarkably turgid and unenergetic despite the  large helpings of action and violence.
Visually inventive?  Yes.  Wondrous to behold?  Without a doubt.  Da Vinci himself could have painted  every landscape in this film and it still would have been a bloody mess.  It has no pace.  It has no subtlety.  It has no restraint.  It has none of  the qualities necessary to take a well-animated epic and turn it into a  truly great--no, that's aiming too high--an even remotely satisfactory  experience.  Note to the multitude of diehard anim fans who will no doubt  be infuriated by my lack of respect for this ""masterpiece"":  I may not be  crazy about the genre, but I believe that it's just like any other  genre--capable of great things, so long as a little economy is applied.  I  would rather sit through a fifteen-hour ""Sailor Moon"" marathon than watch  PRINCESS MONONOKE again.",963705600,3,2451,4.839416058394161

1326111,5,B00003CXBK,"Unfortunately, animation films are never nominated for best picture -- let alone best foreign film.  In my opinion, this was the best film of 1999(American release).  It is a story of mythic proportions, that tells  the tale of a woman of nature pitted against a woman of industry.  It's  also the tale of a young prince outcasted by a bizzare disease who tries to  bring peace between the two factions.  And finally it's a tale of those who  hunt a god, and the ramifications this brings.  Miyazaki's artwork is  breath-taking, and you will never forget this film.  Puts Disney  productions to shame.

What he finds is a town under attack from vicious wolves. Well,  the wolves are only trying to protect their territory. Even better, these  wolves are not just wolves, but actually gods if you will. They have raised  a young human girl.. who believes herself to be a wolf herself, despising  humans. Where the story goes from here, I'll let you decide, or find a  synopsis elsewhere. It's not my place to ruin the film for you. The  translation was scripted by Sandman's Neil Gaiman, and well done at that.  The only gripe I have with this film is a few of the voices.. Billy Bob  Thorton just wasn't a convincing monk... I also feel they probably could  have found a better voice for the Princess herself. But oh well, still an  excellent, must-see film.

A young prince  from a far away clan is searching  for the Night- walker - a great mystical spirit which rules  the forest -  to seek help for a secret and horrible wound.  There is also the warrior  woman (essentially a queen) who rules a city of emancipated women who work  a mining forge which is slowly destroying the forest.

1326212,4,B00003CXBK,"I admire to a certain degree the whole Japanese animation thing. As a child, I watched those ""mecca"" transformation cartoons like ""Robotech"" and ""Voltron"". If grown-up,  ""heady"" stuff like Mononoke Hime was around back in the early  80's, I never saw it. I'm rather new to the whole ""serious"" anime  stuff and after hearing consistantly glowing reviews about this movie, I  had to see it for myself. What can I say? It's an unusual film. A little  weird. But the animation flows a little smoother than most other anime I've  seen and the depth of character certainly goes beyond much of the silly  American cartoons. Some of the plot was hard for me to follow but as my  first cimematic experience of Japanese animation goes, I eventually liked  it. It kind of reminded me of the dreadful ""Ferngully: The Last  Rainforest"" but this film goes way beyond that into a whole new  territory of quality. I enjoyed it's surreal nature as well. There were  extended scenes where there was no dialogue. Just dreamlike images of water  moving and the wind blowing through the trees and sky. I like animation  that isn't always so talky. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was like that  and it was beautiful. I enjoy it when animators allow facial expressions  and movement to sub for dialogue for awhile. Anyway, sometimes when I come  out of a film, it takes me a little while to decide if I really enjoyed it  or not. I have to think about the images I saw and the story. That was the  case with Mononoke Hime. But in the end I really did like it. It was  different, (well, here in America anyway), as far as ""forest""  movies go. I pre-ordered the DVD and after seeing this, I don't even want  to see Disney's ""Tarzan"". It probably wouldn't capture my  imagination as much.",956102400,,1752,4.580645161290323

I always thought the animation was choppy and storylines  bland.  This completely changed my mind.  Princess Mononoke is the best  movie I have ever seen, anime or not!( I've seen almost every movie from  Terminator to Sense and Sensiblity)  I loved how Miyazaki never created a  bad guy.  The most obvious one has good motives, and by the end of the  movie, you're left wondering if this was a movie or a play of real-life  relationships.  It didn't have the classic good vs.evil plot we've all seen  with every movie.  It displays real friendships and issues.

I thought this one was  great.. however i've never seen the japanese version im sure it's no  different from any other one... except im not sure why people are so upset  over the dubbing.. i thought neil gaimans script went along great with the  mouth movements.. and why people are complaining that it should only be  shown in the original japanese confuses me. the only reason its in japanese  is because it was made in japan.. if the predominant language here was  japanese it would make sense.. but it's not.. i guess its great for those  people that are anime buffs ..but for those of us who just like to enjoy  movies it works.. since people who are not really into the genre won't care  to read and miss the action on the screen... the subtitles are ok only if  you have nothing else to do but watch it a hundred times and know what  happens by heart.,955843200,2,1055,4.299492385786802
1326215,5,B00003CXBK,"Princess  Mononoke is an utter marval and their will never be another film like it.  It deals about a subject that few films ever do-the effect that we have on nature and it on us.  this is explaining the film on the  simplest scale.  it may be animated but the characters and settings become  as real as you or me. Because Hayao Miyazaki made it in a way that the  animation is not the primary goal of the film. It accomplishes what most  movies try to do it sends a message and it does it with flowing ease. It is  complex, but that's what makes it so great.  Rarely have I seen such great  and thought out storytelling.  Princess Mononoke is a flawless film that  has and is what all films should be-a story told to send a message in an  amazing and breathtaking way.  their is no way this wonderous film could  have been made live action or any other way you can think of.  When the  film is over and the credits begin-you sit their is awe, amazment, and  silence until the credits are over.  then you think i have never seen  anything like it and I want to see it again.  I hope more of Hayao  Miyazaki's films are dubbed into English.  The score is beyond words-I hope  to hear more from the composer.

Second, the DVD is in fact being released with Japanese  language option. It can be watched in English Dub, OR Japanese with (at  least) English subtitles.

Punk kids  and English majors alike can find much in this film to appreciate.  It is  an experience.
Unfortunately, like many Japanese anime films, the ending  of this one felt weird or awkward.  The only other negative comment I have  is directed soley toward Disney:  JAPANESE FILMS MUST BE IN JAPANESE!  It  seems senseless that with all the DVD's capabilities, this one will neither  include the film's orginal language or 5.1 Dolby Digital.

This theater had the potential to distract me from the movie and make everyone there riot and demand their money back.  But they didn't, because everyone was too involved in the movie to notice.  As soon as the show started, everyone was rivited.  My friends and I didn't even leave our seats until after the credits had finished.  We were left dumbstruck.

The story is exciting and relevant.  The characters are dynamic  and personable.  The soundtrack is moving and inspiring.  The artwork is  second to none, using incredible techniques and more colors than any other  animated film ever made.  I couldn't believe it though when the DVD release  annouced only an English dubbed version.  Even if you don't speak the  language, the film is beautifully crafted and easy enough to follow.  The  Japanese-English translation was probably labored over for years, since it  was originally released in Japan in 1997, but there is invariably something  lost in the translation.  If you want to get the true experience from this  wonderful film, you have to hear it in its original Japanese form.  You  can't help but be moved by the dialogue.  The themes on man vs nature, man  vs man and man vs self are self-evident.

Mononoke is set  in fifteenth-century in Japan.  A young boy get mortally wounded  protecting his town from a forest god, a boar made evil by a gunshot.  Accepting his destiny he goes out in the world to find out (""With  unclouded eyes"") why the god had become evil.  Miyazaki's film is in  many ways an ode to nature while at the same time we feel that the people  who are destroying it are humans and really have no other option.  An  astounding experience reminiscent of the finest human passion of the late  Akira Kurosawa, Mononoke was one of the best motion picture of the late  90's.

1326250,5,B00003CXBK,"I keep reading how disappointed most other reviewers are with the lack of a Japanese/English subtitled track on the DVD version. I'll miss one as well, but I have to say that, as English dubbed versions of anime go, this  one was far, far above standard. At least with the English version, my  daughter can follow it. It's harsh for kids, no doubt, but I think it  teaches incredibly important lessons about balance and shades of grey.  Humankind and the natural world are, for better or worse, forced to  cohabit. How we do it so that we can all survive is the question. I think  this film goes a long way toward examining that question, and it finds, as  in reality, no easy answer. Sometimes the best answer is...I don't know.  Maybe our kids will figure it out where we've failed...maybe they'll even  do it with the help of insights gained from this amazing film.
I agree  with others in that it's no movie for a typical kid--real depth of  understanding of complex concepts and a somewhat thick skin are definitely  required.

If I were to rate the movie, I'd give it 1,000,000+ stars.
However, the English dubbed voices, as usual, were terrible. The beautiful original japanese acting should never be destroyed so brutally.  The fact that the acting in this movie brought my rating from 1,000,000 to 3 should show something.

But this version is sub-par: the only Dolby encoding listed as of this review is 2.0(! ), and the voice acting involved in the English  dubbing, as well as a lot of the script ""translation"", is  horrific.  Whoever was in charge of casting, and more specifically casting  Billy Bob Thornton and Jada Pinkett Smith should lose that day job in a  hurry; the southern drawl and South-Central L.A. accents invading the  old-Japan setting of the movie are an assault to the ears and stomach.  The  only redeeming voice in the bunch belongs to the wonderful Minnie Driver,  in her equally wonderful performance as Lady Eboshi.  The English  translation of the script is also a joke.  It takes several creative  liberties with the original story, with the laughable excuse of making it  more ""palatable"" to North American audience tastes, which does  Miyazaki's work a disservice and is an outright insult to intelligence.

I must say that this is one of the absolute BEST anime that I have ever seen!  Truly, five stars  just isn't enough to give this masterpiece of Miyazaki's.  Truly, he  deserves the title, ""the 'Walt Disney' of Japanese animation.""  On a personal note, however, I think Disney did him and his film a great  disservice releasing the English version of the feature only in select  theatres.  Once again, it is a prime example of how animation in this  country is never given enough credit.  Even though I had to read along with  the Japanese dialogue by English translated scripts off of the Internet, I  thoroughly and absolutely enjoyed this movie.  The visuals and story alone  ought to be enough to engross you in its spell, and its non-preachy,  semi-environmentalist message should be a delight for those with like  minds.  Truly, this movie has something for everyone.  Another keen  difference, however, is the fact that this differs from Miyazaki's others  for the maturity of the theme, and the amount of violence it contains, so I  strongly suggest that parents be cautioned before getting the notion of  buying this movie for their kids.  Remember that this is Japanese, not  American animation, and that its PG-13 rating isn't for nothing.  But all  in all, this is one piece of anime the average Otaku (if there is such a  thing ^_^) absolutely CANNOT be without.  This is one movie that is  destined to go down in anime history with such classics as  ""Akira,"" and ""Ghost in the Shell.""

The dual language tracks is the biggest thing that  closes the deal for me to get this DVD. Even though a certain company  didn't want it to do too well in the theaters with the limited release,  this will certainly make all anime fans happy. The animation was all  hand-drawn (over 100,000 frames) but the character cel painting was done  with computer techniques provided by a SoftImage paint plug-in and the  American voice talent was top calibur. Well, except for Claire Danes. The  one thing I would hope for is that the featurette would be longer than  planned. It should show something like the making of the film sorta similar  to Disney's Tarzan (limited Edition) where it promises to show a bunch of  ""making of"" material--from the original concept drawing, to  animation, and to final touches.

As for the story... well others have already covered it but I can  say once again that it is DEEPLY moving, this is a story about a young girl  who is fighting for the life of the forest and the old gods, but it manages  to avoid being feminist or environmentalist--both sides of the conflict are  represented, there are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys""  just a lot of believeable characters with conflicting views.  Also, the  animation is BEAUTIFUL, and (this is essentil) while computers were used,  the actual characters themselves are HAND PAINTED cels (I've seen the cels  in person, don't try to tell me they're not!), many of which were drawn by  Miyazaki himself!

1326362,5,B00003CXBK,"Rare is it for a film, animated or otherwise, to impact you so deeply that you sit in your chair, unable to move, as the end credits begin to roll; stunned at what unfolded before your eyes, what you have just had the  pleasure of beholding - of experiencing. There or two other anime features  that have done this to me. One was Studio Ghibli's heart wrenching  masterpiece 'Grave of the Fireflies' and the other was Studio Gainax's  groundbreaking 'The End of Evangelion'. 'Princess Mononoke' has taken a  place as one of the best films ever created, or should I say dreamed.  'Princess Mononoke' is a dream come true.
 I will not go into the plot  because I feel everyone should go into this film with an open mind, with no  preconceived notions, as I did. Sure, I had a faint idea what the basic  premise was, but nothing had prepared me for what I saw on that screen.
 Mononoke was previously in limited release, showing in small/art  theaters in the top 20 markets (LA, NYC, Chicago, etc.) Miramax had stated  that if it did well in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area then they would go  ahead with a full release. Sadly, Mononoke bombed in this market, so many  people will never be able experience the film in the theatrical ratio  Director Miyazaki originally envisioned. If any Japanese Animation deserved  national theatrical release, it is this one. The animation is, in every  sense of the word, stunning. Far surpassing traditional Disney animation in  terms of CG ingenuity and attention to detail.
  The film is only  rated PG-13, but it is really borderline 'R'. The themes and emotions it  deals with will go right over the heads of younger viewers. Plus there is  some intense and often times violent action. Decapitations become a common  trend in the film, and there is a particularly graphic sequence in which a  hog like animal begins to spew blood from its body. In the screening I  attended I noticed one boy, around 6/7, bury his head in his father's  shoulder. Afterwards, I couldn't help but overhear and younger girl saying  to her dad ""You didn't tell me it was going to be scary..."".  Mononoke is not a child's cartoon, it is serious adult animation with  imagery and dialogue to back that up. Speaking of the dialogue, there is *a  lot* of it. The film spans more than two hours, which will be too long to  keep most second graders interested.
  As far as dubbing is  concerned, it was [surprisingly?] done quite well. Probably one of the best  dubs, actually. The translation is excellent and the voice-lip synch is  nearly flawless. This is one anime where the dubbing won't detract from the  enjoyment of the film.
  As you probably have figured out by now, I  am very excited about Mononoke. I can't help but call the film completely  and utterly perfect. From the epic story to the breathtaking animation,  Mononoke succeeds on all levels. Any film buff that is a film buff deserves  to see this, and this film deserves to be seen.",951004800,19,2963,4.656976744186046

Being an anime fan and have seen  many animes in my life (more than 500 different shows, series, and movies),  and have seen all of Miyazaki's films, I was a little bit skeptical on how  this film will beat all the past wonderful films.

As to the movie itself, I must admit I purchased a DVD  player just in anticipation of this film (I figured if Castle of Cagliostro  was getting a DVD release, so would Mononoke).  So as to the movie itself,  no amount of praise would really be adequit.  Somewhere in the back of my  brain is some idea I formed as a child as to exactly what a powerful and  moving film should be--but it is an idea that came to be discarded because  let's face it, Star Wars or Disney after puberty doesn't live up to the  magic it had at 5 years old.  Surprise, surprise, at age 27 I've seen  something that reminded me of what it was like to be 5 years old again.  Miyazaki has been able to do this consistantly not just because he is a  master storyteller (something so many american films could desperately use)  but because his films immerse you in a world that in a very short time you  fail to notice is a cartoon.  As advanced as Disney animation is, all it's  marvels seem bent on impressing, not on immersion, such that while  impressed we cannot help but remember (sometimes painfully) that we are  watching a cartoon.  Mononoke on the other hand will win the audience over  with the still beauty of its settings long before they've even grasped the  fantastic story line. I must also mention that Mononoke has a simply  amazing soundtrack that is free of upbeat musical numbers or pop songs.  With what to my ears sound like a few bows to Rimsky-Korsakov, Hisashi's  score to this film is as delicious as the film itself, standing well on its  own merit, but in conjunction with the film it is utterly unparalleled.  Very rarely does it seem that a film solidly hits on every count, and even  when it does happen, the force of the film in it's totality is often not so  great.  Mononoke however is not just a solid film but a very strong film as  well.  If there is a weak point here it is the english dub, and yet I for  one found the dub very enjoyable and convincing...yet in a film where  everything is perfect, this will no doubt be the point which will earn the  most criticism. Anyway, I've said enough.  If you havn't seen this, you  must.  Worth buying a DVD player for this movie alone if they'll just get  around to releasing it.",950659200,10,2402,4.372727272727273
1326365,5,B00003CXBK,"I originally wrote a review for the original Princess Mononoke DVD over 14 years ago. My, how time flies! I've kept the old review below for nostalgia, but since I recently got the Japanese Blu-Ray release of this film, I wanted to give an update.

Blu-ray is definitely the way to see this fantastic movie.  If you're considering importing this blu-ray, I'm going to already assume you are in love with the movie and/or have already seen it, but if you haven't there are tons of other reviews to describe the film, suffice it to say I recommend it.  Also, I wanted to reconfirm that YES this blu-ray will work with a US blu-ray player.  It is a Region Free (0) disc so it will work in any region, but FYI, even if it was Region A it would still work in a US blu-ray player since both Japan and the United States are in Region A.  HOWEVER, it is NTSC (the video format used in the US, Japan, etc.) -- so if you have a PAL player (like those in Europe), it probably won't work even though its region free.

PACKAGING:
The Japanese packaging puts Disney's to shame.  It's very minimalist, just the title and little kodama character on the front, but I love the austere aesthetic.  Very simple and to the point, and it matches well with the other Japanese blu-ray releases.  Made from metal presumably, the case is surprisingly heavy for its size, and cool to the touch.  It opens up like a book, and contains a little pamphlet in the left compartment that probably includes details about the disc in Japanese, but also includes full-color illustrations of movie posters for the movie. Very classy presentation.

VIDEO QUALITY:
The same quality and care that's been given to all of the other Ghibli blu-ray releases has extended to Princess Mononoke as well.  Unlike Ghibli's other movies, the landscapes have such rich details that it really adds to the experience to watch this in blu-ray.  This movie was really meant to be remastered into HD.  1080p blu-ray really does this movie justice.  The colors are stunningly bold.  You can see all of the line-work and details.  Since this movie was traditionally animated, it brings the animation alive. It is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than the DVD release.

For a specific example: see the scene where the demon boar attacks the village and battles Ashitaka at the beginning of the film.  In the DVD version, there is an INTENSE amount of blocking and pixelation when rendering the ""tentacles"" on the boar squirming so fast, but in blu-ray the scene is perfect without any issues.

AUDIO/SUBTITLE QUALITY:
I've only seen the movie in Japanese with English subtitles and English, so I can't speak to the other tracks (although I've tried each of them out for kicks in a scene or two just to see how the languages compare).  For a list of all the tracks, see the specs section below.  Both English and Japanese have gotten an upgrade - English from 2.0 to 5.1 Dolby Digital (still lossy), and Japanese from Dolby Digital 5.1 to DTS HD 5.1 (lossless audio).  The Japanese track is clear and crisp, as perfect as you can get.  The accompanying English subtitles are very well translated.  The English audio track (the old 1997 theatrical dub with Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, and others) is also clearly improved, but not as crisp as the Japanese track.  I was really happy with both, although I always have a soft spot for the English dub since its how I was introduced to the film even though it admittedly has corny performances.

EXTRAS:
This release also includes a lovely 20 minute documentary entitled ""Princess Mononoke in USA"" subbed in English which chronicles the stateside promotion of the film.  It was a really interesting piece to watch.  However, there wasn't really anything else of interest in the extras.

PROS:
+ It's the only blu-ray option available for US fans at the moment (and Disney will likely be holding back on releasing it in the US until AT LEAST 2015 -- probably even later).
+ The video quality is amazing.
+ Enjoyable mini-documentary in the extras.

CONS:
- It's extremely expensive compared to US blu-rays. However: the Japanese MSRP prices for blu-rays are typically higher than the US for all blu-rays (the MSRP price for this is about $65).  Import shipping times might be another con, but I've seen sellers offer Prime shipping so you can really get this in as little as 1-2 days like American DVDs/Blu-Rays.
- It's a little light on the extras.

OLD REVIEW
---------------------------------------
February 16, 2000
""One of the best movies I had ever seen.""

I, being not an ""anime"" fan, was very critical of this movie when I heard of it.  ""Anime?  From Japan?  Demon-boar gods?  Take it away, please.""  Once, I went to go see it (to laugh about how stupid  it was afterward) and was blown away.  The graphics were superb and the  plot endearing.  I love this movie and hate all other anime movies.  Compared to any anime movie I had ever seen, including Mulan, this was a  giant of its kind.  The lush landscapes were enchanting and the Great  Forest enrapturing.  What was really good though was the plot.  This was no  ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" or ""Pokemon"" movie!  It was a  riviting tale about a young man's journey to remove a curse.  Now, I  haven't seen the Japanese version (I was told that it loses some of its  beauty from Japanese to English), but if it is anything like I saw, it must  have been very good as well.  I especially liked the Kodama, little  people who hop around and click their heads (sounds strange, doesn't it?),  and Moro, the wise Wolf-goddess and somewhat mother to San, or Princess  Mononoke.  I don't know where they got the vice cast for this thing, but  someone had to have been promoted!  Billy Bob Thorton, Jada Pinkett Smith,  Clair Danes, Gillian Anderson, and Minnie Driver were just a few stars from  it!  My favorite character of all though, was Moro whose wise and  intelligent black eyes seem to come alive in the movie.  The pure passion  of this character can make anyone respect her.
  I hope this movie  comes to DVD and video soon, because I want to show my still skeptical  friends how good this movie really is.  They will be amazed that this is  anime.",950572800,5,7233,4.845588235294118
1326366,5,B00003CXBK,"This movie is beautiful and makes you think. It avoids static characters and simplistic good-or-evil dualistic mentality, as well as heavy-handed ""preachiness"" in its treatment of environmental issues. I was  often surprised at my own reaction to this film, as I found myself  concerned about the characters; this doesn't happen very often with me, and  certainly not with animation. All in all, it is an absorbing work that  deserves to be seen by more people. And it DEFINITELY needs to be released  on DVD. Please vote for the DVD release of this film if you haven't  already, and if you haven't seen it, do whatever you can to remedy that  problem.",950572800,4,652,4.81981981981982
1326367,5,B00003CXBK,I was one of the lucky few who lived near a theater and got to see this movie. This is the way movies were meant to be!

Do not let this mvie pass us by  on a US release!,950572800,,316,3.6176470588235294
1326368,5,B00003CXBK,"This is an excellent movie. Its a shame it got shafted by a poor release. If it had been promoted like some of the other disney movies and if it had been in more theatres it probably would have been huge. As it is, though, this will have to fall into the catagory: Killed by the MPAA. Buy the  DVD!",950572800,,298,3.966666666666667
1326369,5,B00003CXBK,"Nobody can deny that when it comes to serious animation, the Japanese are the masters. The U.S. has only recently started to make decent animated dramas, such as ""The Iron Giant"". The Japanese have been doing it  for years, and this movie is the culmination of that cultural expertise.  Watch it.",950486400,,296,4.784313725490196
7918306,3,B00003CXBK,"You know, sometimes I think I'm a barbarian.  Well, ancestrally, I am, but this isn't relevant to the discussion.

No, today its about how this flick is One Of The Great Ones.... and like Conan in a throne room, it was as special as using the drapes to wipe my dirty, mutton-y hands.

Don't get me wrong, its a pretty good flick.  The story echoes many others that have come before.  Man versus nature.  The Natural World versus the Industrial.  Worm demons versus animals without Heartgard prescriptions.

The dubbing is good and the use of 'name' Hollywood talent isn't distracting, even when you are talking about Billy Bob, who never met a plot he didn't like disrupting.  Bad monk, I mean... Santa.

No, my real confusion is that this is... just a decent anime flick.  Not one of the cornerstone tales from Studio Ghibli and worth the study of film schools the world over.  I don't get it, ya know?  What am I missing?  Or is it just a case of the barbarian not having the palate for tea and crumpets, maybe?",1526256000,,1013,4.4945054945054945
