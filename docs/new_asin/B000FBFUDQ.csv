2559096,5,B000FBFUDQ,"The movie is a homage to Friday the 13th and it actully works. The guy in the first movie looks like #6 from Slipknot. The movie seemed real, espeically the death scenes. The humour is not from lines in the movie, just the way the clown fights. The movies are a little over an hour but all are worth viewing. 3 movies on 1 dvd? Diffently worth the used price.",1182384000,7,359,4.142857142857143
2559097,3,B000FBFUDQ,"The Camp Blood films are hands down the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. They are pathetically acted, badly directed messes, but are very entertaining if you're into that sort of thing.

Camp Blood (1999) tells the tale of two couples and their guide that go into the woods for a weekend of camping and hiking, but are set upon by a person wearing a clown mask that has apparently been haunting the woods for several years now. It was shot on video rather than film on a budget that appears to be of upwards of $200-$300.

Camp Blood 2 (2000) It's been a year since Trish survived the massacre and she's now in an insane asylum. One day a sleazy director comes to her saying that he's making a movie about her story and he wants her to be the creative consultant. She agrees and they head off to the woods to shoot the film, only to find out that last year's events are repeating themselves. This film was also shot on video. The only distinction between Camp Blood 1&2 is that in part 2 the actors are even worse.

Camp Blood 3: Within The Woods (2005) Some rich TV producer decides to shoot a reality show in the same spot that the infamous murders took place several years ago. The contestants show up and so does the killer clown. This time they shot on film, so it looks a little better than the previous two, but it's arguably even worse. The acting and dialogue is horrible and there are loads of continuity issues. Oh, and there's some insanely ugly woman taking her clothes off too.

They're all really awful, the first one being the best of the three. The gore is pretty decent, proving anyone can do convincing looking make-up FX as long as they study the early work of Tom Savini long enough. These movies are best enjoyed with a bowl of popcorn and a bunch of your friends ready to rip them apart.

Also recommended for anyone who enjoys the Camp Blood Trilogy: The Dead Next Door, Redneck Zombies, & Beware! Children At Play.",1157328000,15,1955,4.389502762430939
2559098,4,B000FBFUDQ,"This is one of those superbee campy slasher films.  You can see the dollar signs go up though on the budget in subsequent films.  The third one has at least one attractive person in it that looks like they may be a real actor.  The 3rd would appeal to most audiences, but you have to be a true fan to really enjoy the first two.  My suggestion is to get some friends together, fill up the ice cooler with some adult beverages and NEVER shush anyone that comments during these movies, their comments are the best part!",1156896000,10,517,4.298969072164948
2559099,4,B000FBFUDQ,Ha ha.  These movies are hilariously bad.  Do you like cheesy horror movies?  You'll love these if you do.,1241827200,3,106,4.473684210526316
2559100,1,B000FBFUDQ,"How is this series getting a 3 star average. these movies suck, and no they are not funny, they suck to much. i got a hernia just watching the first one let alone being forced to watch the next 2 by a friend. AHHHHHHH.",1235692800,3,218,3.977272727272727
2559101,3,B000FBFUDQ,"'Camp Blood' (0 stars) totally amateurish in every way; vhs camcorder film-quality; poor acting; major plot flaws---the clown at the end is obviously not the clown who did the killing during the movie, and 3 of the actors whose characters are killed during the movie return at the end of the movie playing 3 different characters....huh? The female lead is average-looking, and one of the males is very annoying.
'Camp Blood 2' (2 stars) better than the first in every way; story taken from ""Aliens"". Same average-looking female lead, but other better-looking girls in it. (One of the girls in the movie says her name is Ashley Dupree---Elliot Spitzer's hooker? lol)
'Camp Blood 3' (3 stars) best film-quality of all, but story not as good as #2; the best-looking girls are in this one.",1230422400,4,785,4.865671641791045
2559102,5,B000FBFUDQ,I really like these low budget horror movies. They are so funny and the effects are so bad that its actually good. I recommend this movie to anyone whose not looking for anything serious or scary.,1211241600,3,196,4.472222222222222
2559103,5,B000FBFUDQ,"What do you get when you take:

a. a very cheap budget
b. very poor acting
c. a ""killer"" clown
d. awesome ""Clown Vision""?

You get camp blood!!  The movies are among the greatest cheese fest you could ever hope to devour!  These movies do for killer clowns, what Jack Frost did for killer snowmen (although on a very different budgets) My favorite parts are the clown sounds (sounds like half bird, half balloon scrape) and of course ""Clown vision""  (which would have been better if they had flashed the words ""Clown Vision"" on the screen)

If you enjoy horror that's full of poor acting, and clowns that get punched in the face, then this is the set for you!  Next time you go camping, take your recorder!!",1209340800,3,707,4.4765625
2559104,3,B000FBFUDQ,"Camp Blood- The title is actually from ""Friday the 13th series"" thats what they all called ""Camp Crystal Lake' Anyways, this movie isn't so bad, it does look like someone used a camcorder and video taped it, but it's ok. I would say if you are a ""B"" movie fan, this one is worth checking out. If you are looking for serious horror, then look away. The story follows 4 kids who go camping @ ""Camp Blood"" they find out why it's called that, when they meet a crazy man in the middle of the road on the way to the camp site. Apparently there was a massacre, completed there a few years back by a killer clown.",1206316800,,605,4.135593220338983
2559105,5,B000FBFUDQ,"Produection means nothing, and these films proves it.  It follows the usual steps of a Slasher franchise, part one is excellent, part II is pretty good and party three is just passible.  Anyhow great horror films, great gore, great atmosphere and a nitty gritty Texas Chainsaw feel to it.  Get this baby now, all three films in one.",1205625600,4,332,4.689655172413793
2559106,5,B000FBFUDQ,"This movie was so much fun to watch! I really liked a lot of the camera angles and I thought it was an excellent  job for a B horror movie.
Watch it and have fun with it! Anyone who watches it to think it's a serious horror movie- you may want to move on but for the rest- it's worth a buy! I loved the clown mask too!",1203984000,2,318,3.676470588235294
2559107,1,B000FBFUDQ,These movies just remind me of people being videotaped while in the woods. I do not recommend them at all. I do love horror movies. But these are not what I call horror.,1191283200,3,169,4.151515151515151
8119973,1,B000FBFUDQ,Bought this to watch bad horror movies and make fun of it...while drinking ya know?... so pretty much have to give it a 1 star right?,1487635200,,133,4.153846153846154

8119976,4,B000FBFUDQ,"After watching almost every slasher film I could find (I am not a fan of all horror genres), I came across the title ""Camp Blood"" on the internet. So, as long as its price was good I decided to purchase the trilogy. To be honest, when I realised that the first film (as well as the second) were almost DIY productions I became anxious. But I have to admit that the result was a positive surpsrise for me.
First of all, the idea (although not exactly innovative) is catchy enough (it comes at its peak with the second film, the third one is a good contemporary slasher, no more no less).
Second, although the actors are not famous and the director apparently does not have acess to expensive devices, everyone does his best.
Third, the whole atmosphere, the music, sounds, flashbacks etc. are grotesque at the same time that are plain, realistic.
Overall, I am quite satisfied that I got the trilogy. And I am sure that most of slasher fans will be too.",1386028800,3,952,4.477011494252873
8119977,2,B000FBFUDQ,"SOV horror films for people that don't need to use their brain cells when watching a film. As a matter of fact, it would be better if you are just brain dead.",1385683200,,158,3.96875
8119978,2,B000FBFUDQ,Camp blood is shot with what seems like a camcorder really shacky and bad dialog but it was worth wachen it was funny haven't wached the 3rd but i bet its just as bad but the 1st was so bad idk how they got 2 sequles made is beyond me o well if you got some extra cash its a ok movie to buy and watch if you like films like the blare witch project,1344902400,,347,3.64
8119979,3,B000FBFUDQ,"In the first film 2 couples go camping in the woods only to meet a killer clown. In the second film, a survivor from the first movie (sorry about the plot spoiler) teams up with a movie crew to film a movie about the incident, only to meet a killer clown. The third film involves a reality show going out to that same spot, only to meet a killer clown. I think you get the idea.

The blood and body parts were very fake looking. The acting and dialouge were bad, but it wasn't ""campy"" by design. What was funny was when someone got socked (film 2), it made a large artificial popping noise, that was just a moment behind the punch. But even as a ""bad"" movie I can't see more than 3 stars.

The first movie was perhaps the best, appearing to be shot in super VHS.

F-bomb, nudity, and sex.",1314921600,,788,4.137254901960785
8119980,4,B000FBFUDQ,"What can I say? I fell in LOVE with the first 'Camp Blood' after 'The Blair Witch Project' came out. I think 'Camp Blood' is a genuinely good movie! The acting is not terrible, and the blood and death scenes are decent. Of course, the built boyfriend  (Michael Taylor) isn't bad, especially in the scene where he is sleeveless and gets wet, lol. The story is about 2 couples going into the woods to camp, and someone dressed as a clown is stalking, and killing, them. And the ending is really interesting, especially when the killer is revealed. The dialogue is kinda boring, but that's because it seems real. Listen to regular people talk, it can be boring. Also, there are a number of editing mistakes and scene looping that could have easily been avoided. Then, there was the sequel, 'Camp Blood 2'. Not as good as the first one. It's a movie in a movie, and I don't like movies like that. A movie is being filmed in the woods about the killings from the previous movie. As the movie production starts, The Clown starts to kill off the cast. The characters are under-developed, so it was hard for me to make a connection with them. The gore is still good, though. What really saved it for me was the ending! And, the third one is not as good as the second one, as the curse of a trilogy seems to go. In the third one, people are asked to stay in the woods where the first two movies happened, for a reality show. All the people that survive split a large cash prize, but The Clown is back. For true fans like me, it's so great to have these 3 movies packaged together.",1311984000,,1571,4.3254237288135595
8119981,1,B000FBFUDQ,"Oh my NO! I don't want to tell anyone what they should or should not watch but these movies are HORRIBLE. I enjoy ALL horror movies from any decade whether they be A or B with a real camera crew or someone following want to be actors around with a camcorder.  These movies, no - there is no thrill, no suspense, no laughability factors, no hot topless or naked chicks running around.  The so called gore is ridiculous but not in a good way.  Reading other reviews I was led to believe that these movies were wonderful and if you were a horror movie fan than they were for you.  Please I think someone is playing a mean joke on everyone.  If you can stay away.  PEW!",1265155200,,665,4.196850393700787
8119982,5,B000FBFUDQ,"I've only seen the first movie so far in this ""collection,"" but I assure you, one of these movies a year is probably enough to tide you over. If you're like me and you love this kind of garbage, stop reading this review and ""buy with one click"" now. The first movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I intentionally watch a lot of low budget, low plot films. Turn it on, kick back, and get inebriated. Perhaps you could make a game out of it, get a little more wasted every time the plot makes no sense, the characters do something stupid, or the acting sucks, but don't blame me if you drink yourself into a coma.",1251763200,3,628,4.155737704918033
