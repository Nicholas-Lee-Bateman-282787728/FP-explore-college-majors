8706688,5,B00UGR5IK4,"The story starts out with a laid-back scene from the back woods of Georgia. Rather reminds you of Sgt. York. Will Stockdale (Andy Griffith) is being drafted in the U.S. Air Force. There he makes fiends with new inductee Benjamin B. 'Ben' Whitledge who informs Will that it is the infantry that does the real fighting and that the Air force is just their helpers. So the two of them set out to be transferred to the infantry. We see how simple it is to transfer.

No Time for Sergeants brings back all the sights and sound that you are familiar with the military, especially the induction process. They even included the military attitudes. What makes this so funny is the proximity to reality. You have met these people in all walks of life. From Irvin S. Blanchard (Murray Hamilton), who has a bad case of the ROTC.  To Major General Eugene Bush (Howard Smith) that unwittingly gives an inspiring eulogy to (I am not saying).

One fun part of watching the movie is not really the movie but recognizing all the actors, some from the original play others look like a retrospect of the Andy Griffith Show.

The situations hopefully are not as easily recognized. Be sure to watch the PLO (permanent latrine officer.)
