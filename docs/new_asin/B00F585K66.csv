8612404,4,B00F585K66,"This series keeps you guessing.  The characters are very believable and continue to surprise the viewer as the series progresses.  You find yourself rooting for the key characters, no matter what plots they have involved themselves with.  Right on the cutting edge of current politics.  Claire Danes makes a great showing of the character traits of a Manic/Depressive patient..... and yes ECT (electronic, convulsive therapy is making a huge come back, albeit much more controlled).",1391990400,2,482,5.386666666666667
