7969703,5,B00006IUGU,"I love EVERY SINGLE MOVIE ADAM SANDLER IS IN/HAS DONE. Alot of the movies he's produced,directed or been ANY part of have ALWAYS had that ""Sandler Touch"". There've been times I've seen a movie&said to myself, ""Self, A.S. had HAD to have SOMETHING to do with this!"" Sure enough, I do a lil research&BINGO BANGO I find out he HAS had an influence on it in SOME way..I LOVE eVRYTHING THIS MAN HAS BEEN IN from ""Overboard""to""Punch Drunk Love""to""Reign Over Me""to""Eight Crazy Nights""to""50 First Dates""..I don't think there's ANY WAY I could be disappointed or NOT LIKE something A.S. has done, can't happen. The ONLY thing I CAN say about this is that I like some of his movies more than others. I DO find myself putting certain DVD's on again&again,whereas some barely see the light of day&others only come out for Special Occasions(""8Crazy Nights"" around Christmas)but they're ALL here. I have them all&THAT makes me a happy content Fan!",1368144000,,933,4.8375
7969704,2,B00006IUGU,these two i think were the worst of adam sandler besides little nicky Mr. deeds was entertaining but he does not spend any of the money he gets to the end so dissapointing big daddy was alright but he could of taught the kid to be a lot worst and it would have been funnier,1082505600,,273,3.981818181818182
