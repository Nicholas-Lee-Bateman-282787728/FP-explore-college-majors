8385100,3,B002ZJ6F0I,I needed something relaxing to view when entertaining. This DVD was good for a while with it's changing scenes although the shark part isn't so pretty. The problem is some scenes being very jerky and locking up. I checked other DVDs to see if my player was acting up but the problem is definitely this one. Be prepared.,1336435200,,319,4.517241379310345
8385101,3,B002ZJ6F0I,"This video is 37 minutes long and features 6 different segments of aquarium life.  The first is a soothing freshwater scene with a huge variety of fish swimming around a rock and algae scape.  The music is a soothing acoustic guitar.  The second segment is a viewing of jellyfish billowing up and down and changing from one luminous hue to another. The music is techno sounding. I found this to be the least appealing of the segments of the video. Segment three is set to a musical harp and features some very odd but beautiful leafy seahorse creatures floating around. Segment four has techno- ominous background music and the scene is sharks circling above a rock and sand floor. Segment five has beautiful clown fish swimming around coral and sea anemones, and the music once again is a bit techno sounding. Scene six is another freshwater scape against a rock background. The music sounds outer space techno with some piano mixed in. Overall I find the visuals appealing, but the background music distracting. This would have been better if the sounds were more natural to the underwater scenes. Visually I would give it 4 starts, but the audio gets 2 stars. Worth renting for 7 days but would not recommend buying it.",1328918400,,1222,4.754716981132075
8385102,5,B002ZJ6F0I,"Often we need a relaxing respite with no personal effort involved, just for a break from the hectic routine.  I found it in this video.  I remember how relaxing it once was to watch the fish in our tank when we were able to maintain an aquarium in our living room.  Now, there's no time for that.  But this video allows us the relaxation without the work or the worry of taking care of the fish. Oh, the music is great. We are enjoying it!",1262995200,,439,4.129411764705883

She said it makes her feel calm and relaxed. So I think of it as an environmental massage. I will certainly think of The Soothing Seacapes DVD  as a great gift to those in Rehab or in a nursing home. It is so serene and full of God's beautiful creations of nature. Thanks so much for such great photography. I would recommend this DVD to all who love nature and need a way to relax.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soothing-Seascapes-from-The-Florida-Aquarium/dp/B002ZJ6F0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soothing Seascapes from The Florida Aquarium</a>",1262908800,,724,5.6422018348623855

Our grandchildren are flying in for a visit this spring.  We're buying a copy of this great DVD for them.  They'll have a chance to preview the wonders of the Florida Aquarium before visiting in person this spring.  They are huge aquarium fans (thank you Finding Nemo!), so this beautifully photographed DVD will find a happy place in their extensive DVD collection.  Thanks Plasma Candy for another winner!",1261612800,,544,4.977777777777778
