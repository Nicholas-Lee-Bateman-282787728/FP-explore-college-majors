8235193,5,B000ZBEOFQ,"Romeo & Juliet: A Monkeys Tale follows the story of Juliet, a particularly attractive Temple Monkey, and Romeo, scrappy scion of the disreputable Market Monkeys. Daring all the odds (and a busy highway with, at times, several cars on it), these two expressive primates meet and fall in lovein between bug-grooming, grocery-stealing, and random acts of vandalism. Romeo is delightfully bouncy, Juliet has surprisingly soulful eyes for a Macaque, and Im pretty sure both roles were played by the same monkeys in most of the shots. A modern classic.",1486857600,,546,5.146067415730337

8235199,5,B000ZBEOFQ,"Flipped over to this and was immediately floored. This was a bunch of out-of-context shots of various monkeyshines happening in Thailand overlayed somewhat with the plot from Romeo and Juliet. Regardless of the created plot, the viewer learns a lot about this particular urban monkey environment. The editing and music are fantastic, including high-tension action scenes that hearken toward summer blockbuster movies. The narration is pretty good but with a lot of groan-worthy Shakespeare puns (that have their own worth in a low-comedy way.) Overall, a very original take on the standard nature documentary, with thrills, ups, downs, crying, laughing, the whole bit. The narrator was excellent but I couldn't help wonder why they didn't go with a more Shakespearian British accent. Probably, that doesn't really matter. Highly enjoyable, and kudos to whoever greenlit this as it's quite daring. It is hilariously influenced by Baz Lurman's Romeo + Juliet. Five stars without even thinking about it. Extremely entertaining.",1214524800,7,1024,5.487341772151899
8235200,5,B000ZBEOFQ,This is interesting in that the movie overlays the story of Romeo and Juliet--mostly--on the lives of two troops of wild monkeys. A great and enjoyable movie for people who don't even watch the Animal Planet. This is also fairly safe for kids--there is one scene of monkeys doing the nasty. But that's only for about 5 seconds.,1203292800,,327,4.655172413793103
8235201,5,B000ZBEOFQ,"The story unfolds at the Prang Sam Yot temple in Lopburi, Thailand.

The 1080 HD resolution captures every detail of the historic landmark which makes the setting a visual delight.

The soundtrack and editing are top-notch, so much that you are left scratching your head at the end of the film, wondering in in fact if you just watched monkies perform Shakespeare. (Crab-eating Macaque are not an endangered species for those that care)

You won't regret buying this for yourself or as a gift.

Much like ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" you watch in delight while a story unfolds starring non-actors who are brilliant at what they do.",1199145600,3,627,4.777777777777778
