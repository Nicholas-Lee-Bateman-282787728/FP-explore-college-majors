8351423,5,B0025X4PDI,"Roy and Dale along with Pat Brady and his Jeep. It don't get much better than that. I do love these old Roy and Dale TV shows. Each picture always taught this young boy a new good deed. I don't see much of that in TV shows these days, but come to think of it I have stopped watching TV for the most part. I have taken years to collect all the ones I loved growing up and watch them. Thank God for DVDs.",1462060800,,402,3.7976190476190474
8351424,5,B0025X4PDI,"Super series.  I have volumes 1-16 and plan on getting the rest.  These movies of Roy and Dale bring back memories of my childhood when I used to play Roy, and my cousin played Dale.  We both had horses, and Roy Rogers' gun sets.  Those were the days when Heroes were actually heroes and willingly served as positive role models.  When I have grandchildren, I look forward to setting down on Saturdays and watch these movies with them.",1416096000,,435,4.5256410256410255

8351426,4,B0025X4PDI,Love the old Roy Rogers TV series.  Picture quality of these DVD's could be better because the same episodes that are shown on TV now are much better.  But still very watchable.,1388448000,,177,4.5

8351428,5,B0025X4PDI,"Brings back a lot of good memories when I was a kid chasing outlaws. Wish we could go back in time and pick certain years. I grew up with Roy, Gene, Hoppy and the rest of the good guys. Well worth the money. Only wish it had been restored like some of the old westerns are today.",1359331200,,279,3.912280701754386
