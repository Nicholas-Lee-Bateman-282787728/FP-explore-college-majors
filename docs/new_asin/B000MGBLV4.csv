2730495,1,B000MGBLV4,"This movie portrays an extremely negative, sadistic and morbid picture of indigenous people of Peru. I have no doubts that peruvian indigenous culture has it's downfalls, but I feel that a critique of it's society should not come from an elitist white Peruvian who lives in Europe. This movie is part of the history of using film to inseminate and reproduce cultural ignorance, prejudice and racial superiority.
It's unfortunate that the spectacle- beautiful cinematography, colors, sounds- mesmerizes most audiences without eliciting any real critique. I'm amazed that it's won so many festivals and received so much attention. This is very telling on how very racist our world and the media, even indymedia, is.",1242259200,11,713,5.31858407079646
2730496,4,B000MGBLV4,"A fairly macabre story that would be something more at home on the Twilight Zone or in a painting by Brueghel. A Spanish stranger from Lima wanders into an Indian village during the Holy Time, the period of time between Good Friday and Easter, when by village tradition God is dead and cannot see the sins on the villagers. They don't want him there, he's a foreigner to them, and they don't want him to witness their actions during this special time. The local mayor locks him up to protect him, but he breaks out and wanders into a world he didn't know existed and can't begin to understand, even if parts of it look familiar. Madeinusa is the name of the young woman on the cover, chosen by her father the mayor to play the role of Mary during Holy Time. She dreams of escape into the modern world of Lima, away from her brutal father who has been waiting for Holy Time for his own perverted reasons. It's a fascinating decent into Hell and takes a number of interesting twists and turns. The actors are all strong in their roles and make film all too real. The cinematography is particluarly beautiful with the Andes in the background. Well worth seeing and a very unique effort.",1236384000,9,1183,4.456221198156682
2730497,4,B000MGBLV4,"Madeinusa is the name of the protagonist of the film (Magaly Solier), a girl who lives in the middle of nowhere in Per. Manayaycuna is her town, and poverty, the simple life of the poor, the alcoholic father, the mean sister and her animals is pretty much all what she knows.
Easter is coming and the town will celebrate it on their own way. It is not Easter but ""Holy Time"" over there, everyone is excited and so is Madeinusa; everyone but the young guy from Lima that got stuck there on his way to a mining camp, and has no option but to spend a few days in Manayaycuna ... with Madeinusa. Just during the time when Christ is dead ... hence, he cannot see us!

Madeinusa pictures a tale where the Christian religion got blended with- and swallowed by- andean traditions, creating their own myths and traditions like the ""Holy Time"" (which indeed, is just a creation of the Director Claudia Llosa, for such thing as Holy Time doesn't actually exist in the Peruvian Andes). Madeinusa will then, take you for a crazy travel for the gorgeous Peruvian Andes, through the eyes of a Lima photographer, meeting an awesome village girl inside a gorgeous but perhaps insane town, with a bunch of well pictured characters that are not that easy to understand.

But don't worry. Madeinusa is NOT a silly Andean version of Cinderella ... not at all. Madeinusa is a masterpiece of art, displaying the magic of the Peruvian Andes, the beautiness of simple people and the evil spirit of human being. Don't expect a romantic tale, don't expect a Per's documentary. Just seat and enjoy the debut of the current Golden Bear holder and the performance of an actress, who a couple of months before the film, was actually a village girl, discovered by the Director while she was selling potatoes and other food stuff at her town ... a place perhaps not so different to Manayaycuna.",1234742400,20,1861,4.619335347432024
2730498,3,B000MGBLV4,"Salvador, a metizo from Lima, ends up getting stranded in the remote indigenous village of Manayaycuna. Don Cayo, the town's mayor, locks him away so he won't interfere with the upcoming Holy Time. Holy Time occurs between Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The people of Manayaycuna believe that on these days God is dead and all sins are permitted. Salvador escapes from his locked pen and befriends Cayo's daughter Madeinusa. Salvador and Madeinusa plot to leave together for Lima. But, in the end, a disturbing twist changes the plan.

Thi is a highly symbolic film aiming to be ""high art"". But I personally was left confused and unsatisfied. I believe that movies, and other creative forms, that are so vague in meaning as to become indecipherable are neither artistically successful nor pleasurable to watch. Some may like this film for it's lofty intentions. But I found it to be overly pretentious and boring.",1228521600,,913,4.967320261437909
2730499,4,B000MGBLV4,"This film is based in the fictional indigenous village of Manayaycuna (""the town no-one can enter"" in Quechua) in the Andes Mountains. Here, the indigenous people have merged their traditional beliefs with the Catholicism brought to them by the conquistadors, forming a very loose interpretation on what happens between Good Friday and Easter Sunday. In this corrupt town, God dies on Good Friday and is born again on Easter, and between those days there is no sin because 'God is dead.'

The story is centered around a ""nave"" 14-year-old girl by the name of Madeinusa (pronounced Ma-den-OO-za) and a migrant worker from Lima who gets stranded in the town for the weekend. He is not welcome here on these Holy Days, and for good reason. God may not see sin, but this town certainly feels as though the outsiders can spoil their fun. A lot of reviews paint this as a love story of sorts, with Madeinusa falling for the 'gringo,' yet in my mind it is a story of a girl, who is fascinated with the stranger because he is different and she is searching for a way out. We can only guess what her life is life the rest of the year outside the Holy Days.

Throw in a father with incestuous plans and a jealous sister and you get a strange tale that will bring you to a surprising conclusion. I found this to be an interesting tale, yet feel it is important not to take away the idea that anything is inherently wrong with the cultural beliefs of the indigenous people of Peru, even if they are taken together with Catholicism. Roman Catholicism is the official religion of Peru and plays a major role in Peruvian culture, but in many areas it is intricately mixed with facets of Inca beliefs, annual celebrations of village patron saints' days often coincide with preconquest harvest observances that really gives communities their own character.",1191456000,8,1839,4.672839506172839
2730528,5,B000MGBLV4,"So well done, completely a philosophical metaphor of good, evil, love, selfishness, subordination, hope, empathy.  Worthwhile to view.",1406073600,,134,6.444444444444445

2730530,3,B000MGBLV4,"An intriguing but disturbing tale of a young girl incongruously named Made in USA living in a remote Peruvian mountain village. Her mother has abandoned her husband and  two daughters for the bright lights of Lima, the capital city. Made in USA, just fourteen years old, sees an opportunity to follow her mother's footsteps when a handsome young stranger from Lima happens upon the village during the mystical weekend between Good Friday and Easter Sunday when the villagers believe that otherwise sinful deeds are allowed since Christ, whose effigy they venerate, has died and is not yet risen. The perpetually drunken father, mayor of the hardscrabble village, has his way with his elder daughter at night and in the end she serves him up a bowl of soup laced with rat poison. But the suspicion that she is no victim is borne out in the end when she blames the killing on the stranger whom she had seduced on the night of the Good Friday festivities all bedecked in her costume of Miss Holy Week Virgin. The movie ends with Made in USA alone on a bus heading to Lima. The fate of the young man trapped behind at the mercy of the villagers is left to the imagination of viewers.

This movie has won a number of awards, including at the Sundance and Seattle International Film Festivals, but I can only surmise that it was thanks to the authenticity of the setting and the unscripted performances of a cast that is entirely indigenous, with the sole exception of the hapless stranger from Lima. Pity that such a beautiful landscape should be the setting for such a sordid tale.",1359763200,4,1577,4.648745519713262
2730531,1,B000MGBLV4,"Six of us are off to Peru this week for a trek so we've shared suggestions for books and movies that relate to Peruvian culture and environment.  I usually enjoy offbeat films and thought this might be one when it started with a young girl setting out rat poison but I found the story sickening for many reasons and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Jealousy, incest, deceit, victimization in the name of religion, rats and head lice......if this is your cup of tea you might like Madeinusa.  The CD was flawed, as well, and the subtitles were screwed up the last 15 minutes or so of the film.....this may have been the best part!",1336867200,5,629,4.508771929824562
2730532,4,B000MGBLV4,"Very creepy movie set in an isolated Peruvian village. A lone traveler gets held hostage in some village until their macabre festival is completed--he intends on continuing his journey one way or another. In the process he meets the Mayor's daughter and things really pick up from there. It's like an episode of the Twilight Zone only South American style. Creepy tone, good flick.",1327363200,,381,4.96875
2730533,5,B000MGBLV4,"Directed by Oscar nominee Claudia Llosa (Milk of Sorrow), this imaginative film follows the life of its main character, 14-year-old Peruvian girl called Madeinusa living in a remote village in the Cordillera Blanca Mountain range.
The village's everyday life if formed by religious rituals and traditions, taken for granted. When Salvador, a young geologist, arrives to the village, things change for Madeinusa.

Madeinusa is played with the remarkable authenticity by Magaly Solier, who later also starred in Milk of Sorrow.",1295481600,,525,5.5625
2730534,4,B000MGBLV4,"Pretty good film overall. I did not feel Madeinusa was ""culturally insensitive"" or racist as other reviewers have suggested. I did, however, think the writing was at times amateurish--which may have created an unintentional result of bigotry. There were moments that I absolutely LOVED, and Magaly Solier (lead role) was very convincing and powerful. I did feel that there were a few lost opportunities. It seemed to me that there were too many close-ups and not enough wide establishing shots to capture the powerful qualities the setting.  Overall, I really enjoyed the film and was left thinking about it much more than I anticipated--a nice blend of beauty and darkness. Strong effort!!",1272412800,,690,5.160714285714286
2730535,5,B000MGBLV4,"MadeinUSA is a very interesting concept, a small religious town goes to the extreme with the execution of its mythology. They hold that, to this day, from the time when jesus was crucified until his resurection on Easter: God is dead. During this time there is no one to impart morals onto the world, so there is no sin and there is no guilt. This amnesty makes everyone in the town indulge their dark, lascivious side: including a stranger from Lima who stirs a young girl from the blind devotion to the tradition that harms her. This could be used as the premise for all sorts of gore and exploitation, but luckily MadeinUSA doesn't go that route. It explores what is left after the superego leaves a supressed society. At times the film feels a bit too voyeuristic, but it is saved by the overwhelming feeling that such moral atrocities can only happen when the forboding fesivtal-cum-funeral march is reverberating through the town. At its heart, it is a scinitilating critique of a relience on society to dictate our behavior, when really we should be thinking for ourselves.",1271376000,2,1080,4.75
2730536,5,B000MGBLV4,"Madeinusa is a 14-year-old girl who lives with her father and sister in a stone dwelling with a dirt floor. It's more substantial than a hut but too primitive to be called a house. There is no electricity. The kitchen faucet emits just a trickle of water.

The family live in a remote village in the mountains of Peru. The nearest telephone is miles away. ""Made"" and her sister take turns spreading rat poison around the perimeter of the dwelling. Dead rats bring good luck. In just a few hours Made's father will have one of his fondest wishes realized. He'll have sex with his daughter. Made sings sad songs.

The movie opens with the start of the Easter festival. The village's dozen or so young virgins, lavishly costumed, go on parade. Made is selected as the year's most beautiful. We learn that Made's dad is the town's mayor, a man highly esteemed in the region. The selection of his daughter makes his upcoming conquest all the more exciting!

This festival has a twist.  The villagers have made it a tradition that God is dead from Good Friday to Easter Sunday.  He can't see their transgressions. Sin does not exist. A man can have sex with his daughter and it won't matter. Made has known for a long time that this day would come.  Incest is a natural part of life, something the village daughters stoically accept. Anyone suggesting there's something wrong with the arrangement might be stoned by these primitives. It's a fate that could be in store for any outsider who stumbles upon the warped festival.

The film takes a detached view of the bizarre happenings. The wild party, called Holy Time, includes many beautifully-photographed scenes of pageantry and debauchery (although there are no graphic depictions of sex).  There's no attempt to manipulate the viewer's emotions, no effort to demonize or glorify any character.

Made has the honor of kicking off Holy Time. In a solemn ceremony, the crucified Jesus is taken down from his perch and blindfolded.  This Jesus is a  comical mannequin, with moveable arms and eyes. Made kisses him reverently on the mouth.

Although the villagers are free to do as they please, no one seems to have much fun. They act as if the festival is a religious observance in which they must dutifully participate. The merriment is robotic, not joyful.

The movie is packed with astonishing imagery.  The musical score is hauntingly beautiful. Made's songs are incredibly touching.  It's one of the most moving and amazing movies I have seen. It's Claudia Llosa's first film. Topping it will be a formidable challenge.",1260748800,8,2568,4.817767653758542
2730537,1,B000MGBLV4,"I don't think artists should use marginalized and discriminated against cultures this way.  My understanding is that indigenous Peruvian people suffer pretty bad from discrimination within their country, and here's a little movie that invents a backwards tradition and portrays an indigenous community's fictional wife swapping and a father/town mayor that can't wait to have sex with his pretty young daughter.  Imagine an American movie that portrayed Latino, African American, or Native American cultures that way!  With no basis in fact it would never fly.  The interesting aspect of the movie is that it makes you think about how such a tradition would cause nothing but suffering for all involved, and if it were, for example, an American movie about white country folk it might be like a Children of the Corn/ Twighlight Zone kind of creepy concept, but in this context the racial implications are impossible to ignore (or forgive).",1250121600,10,939,5.198675496688741
