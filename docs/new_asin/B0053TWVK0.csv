4552281,4,B0053TWVK0,"I remember watching this movie when it came out in 1986.  I liked it then, so when I saw it for sale cheap, I had to see it again.  And I liked it again, maybe even more than I did the first time, but probably for different reasons.

The film is funny.  I laughed several times at some of the dialogue, especially when Roger meets his new neighbor for the first time.  The scenes that are written to bring a smile always did for me.

The film is suspenseful in a B Movie kind of way.  Lots of ""what's behind the closet"" moments, and (I don't know how to say this right) well timed music that provide slight jumps for the viewer.

The ""horror"" or ""gore"" are silly B movie props, suits and makeup, but again, that is what is fun about the movie.  It's so bad at points (the fat lady suit) that it's good.

I think the thing I liked best about it this time is the fact that it is a perfect example of what 1986 was like.  I loved seeing the clothes that the characters wore, very late 80's (that sweater vest!).  The soap opera that Kay Lenz starred on.  Even the actors.  It all brought back the time for me.  It was great.

So I recommend it.  It may not be for everyone, but for people who like silly, funny, horror (ish) movies, I think you will enjoy this.",1330732800,,1258,4.090163934426229

While Amazon does indicate the presentation is in ""widescreen"" format, I was disappointed to see the glaring 1.33:1 label on the back of the case when it arrived.  Fortunately, the printing is in error and the film is, in fact, presented in 16x9 ""anamorphic"" widescreen.  SO, there you have it - Amazon's item details are correct.  Sorry this isn't a full-blown review... if you're a fan of the movie, I'm sure this will bring back some fun memories of 80's horror. I haven't really had a chance to sit down and watch the whole DVD yet, but the picture quality seems decent enough from what I saw when I popped it in for a few minutes (if you're hoping for a full blown restoration - this ain't it, I can tell you that much).

4552309,4,B0053TWVK0,"Not quite a horror movie and not quite a comedy, House is plagued with an odd plot that includes far too many sequences where the main character abruptly goes back and forth between reality and his time in Vietnam.  Were led to believe hes an author of some repute.  But.  The viewer is also (slowly-slowly) made aware that this author (William Katt as Roger Cobb) has a few loose screws because he lost his son in a swimming pool..........literally, lost the kid in the pool, as in couldn't find him in the pool.  His aunt hangs herself.  So naturally he has to move back into the house where he suffered such great tragedies.  And.  His actress wife (Kay Lenz) moved on with her life without him.  He quickly discovers the house is either haunted or a portal of some sort.  Garden tools attack him.  Strange bulbous cartoony characters attack him.  He has a nosy neighbor (George Wendt).  Late in the movie, for no apparent reason, a couple of songs of that period start blaring.  Its a weird movie that defies classification.  Its neither this nor that.  The best character is a pesky hand that just won't go away.

And yet, I find it oddly beguiling.  Its a mess but its a fun mess (that could have used a sturdier hand at the helm.)",1477353600,,1237,4.475336322869955

There are movies that are bad/good and then there are movies which appear to be of this type just bad/bad. My wife and I have what we call the 2 minute test. It has been our experience that a good movie will grab you within the first two minutes (usually less).

4552345,5,B0053TWVK0,"I liked this show a lot. This is because it is of a house that causes illusions to get rid of people inside of it. A lot of this horror film is silly and laughable. Richard Moll is in this with other good actors, I think it is a very funny show. It does start off morbid, so don't let that throw you off at first, it starts to get funnier as you watch the movie.",1404000000,,362,3.776315789473684
4552346,5,B0053TWVK0,"It starts out as a cliche...the slightly batty aunt who kills herself, the nephew she raised now inheriting her house...and the things he faces when he comes home to settle the estate, and then...there's a startling twist, and it's downhill all the way, filled with scary scenes tinged with just enough black humor to keep them from being truly horrible.

A famous horror novel writer, Roger Cobb brings with him lots of baggage in the form of a missing son, a fresh divorce, and a case of writers' block aided by the novel he MUST write. There are creepy camera angles and creaky sounds.  Plenty of cliched shots we expect and are surprised when they aren't completed, such as the opening and closing of the bathroom mirror...when will the ghastly image appear in it?  Answer...never!

Roger's next door neighbor thinks he's going off the deep end. He phones the ex-wife who hurries home, only to be mowed down by an accidental shotgun blast...or has she?  Just when we think we've got a handle on how the story's going to go, it turns into a tongue-in-cheek comedy of terrors, complete with a fitting song soundtrack...and away we go!

After that moment of shock when the creature chasing Roger is mowed down by assorted gardening tools lurking behind a closed door, I settled in to enjoy this very different movie.  William Katt is perfect in the part. Grieving for his lost child, determined to get his novel written or else, still loving his ex-wife, and stubbornly resisting the temptation to run screaming into the night after each weird occurrence, he's a hero par excellence, quietly forging onward in spite of everything he sees...or thinks he sees.

The bringing together of Roger's Vietnam experiences with the occurrences in the house may seem far-fetched but the way it's played, who cares.  Some may complain of the final scene, since there's none of the usual drawn-out explanation of why any of it happened, but it isn't needed. Why prolong and ruin the effect. Story's over. That's it...and it works.

It always seems to be building up to something but the result isn't what we expect, immersed as we are in the expected cliches of this film genre. That's one of the reasons this movie works so well...lbecause it takes the expected and tilts it just enough...and we laugh instead of scream.

I think I've seen this movie at least 4 times, in the theater, on TV, and my own personal copy.  I recommend it as one of the best pseudo-horror films made.  FIlled with stars who were popular at the time, it's one which can be watched again and again because it isn't dated. (Note: If you watch House 3, expect to find discrepancies between that story and this one, for reasons only the screenwriters can say. This one is the best!)",1400976000,,2744,4.727463312368973
4552357,3,B0053TWVK0,"The ""Midnight Madness"" series of DVDs all feature great image transfers and correct aspect ratios (as others have pointed out on this page), but they are cheating consumers in terms of extra content. If you research the older DVD release of this title, you will find that it had the audio commentary, stills gallery, and other features, whereas the ""Midnight Madness"" series apparently had licensing issues with adding these extras (or transferring them over from earlier releases). Image has produced good DVDs, but this lack of extra content is inexcusable. All that this issue contains is a trailer (along with some bonus trailers tagged on at the beginning). Those of us who care about getting deeper inside of a film's creation appreciate these features, but they aren't to be found on this disc.
As for the movie itself, ""House"" is of course a lot of fun--even when it strains credibility (the hot next-door neighbor capriciously dropping off her son for a crazed Vietnam War vet to babysit!), gets pretty bizarre (the bathroom window into the darkest aspects of the sub-conscious mind), the apparition of the protagonist's ex-wife becoming a hideous creature after at first appearing to be normal--but this is a great fantasy construct (conceived by the strangely forgotten Fred Dekker) and the movie works in many ways. It's half serious, and half horror, but even for all of this it never loses its central drama (and painful reality) of a family having been torn apart. The movie itself I would rate a strong B+. But I can't give the DVD any higher of a marking because I think the lack of extra content is simply lazy. ""House"" got tagged (unfairly?) with an R-rating; there are a few choice words here and there, and some frightening creature effects, but overall this is an entertaining, fairly mild effort from the better end of the 80's horror TV/film market (this isn't the deplorable kind of horror movie that we have nowadays, like the openly empty and antagonistically sadistic ""Saw"" travesties or that kind of ""we see no potential in the future of the human race"" kind of ""horror"")--I see a lot of great 80s/90s TV comedy stars here (if you watch ""Cheers"" or ""Night Court"", you'll see) and it's nice to find a funhouse horror effort that has heart, humanity, and humor at its center. I definitely recommend the movie. (I bought this after seeing the trailer on the ""Slugs"" DVD, so this movie's trailer illustrates how a movie is supposed to be sold.)",1394668800,6,2469,4.8530805687203795

4552363,3,B0053TWVK0,"Horror novelist Roger Cobb(Bill Katt) is a man on the edge, reeling from his recent divorce, haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his young son, and struggling with his new book about his traumatic experiences in Vietnam, but when he moves into the strange house left to him by his late aunt, Roger's precarious sanity comes under siege by nightmares of his dead war buddy, visits from a nosy neighbor, and an onslaught of hideous creatures from another dimension. Horror has found a new home, and it's fully furnished with murder, monsters and madness. William Katt (THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO), George Wendt (CHEERS), Richard Moll (NIGHT COURT) and Kay Lenz (STRIPPED TO KILL) star in this outrageously scary horror hit, produced by Sean S. Cunningham(Director of FRIDAY THE 13TH) and directed by Steve Miner(director of HALLOWEEN H20, FRIDAY THE 13TH-Part 2, and FRIDAY THE 13TH-Part 3).

HOUSE was an awesome horror flick that had a lot of the same actors and actresses from the FRIDAY THE 13TH saga like Ron Carroll(FRIDAY THE 13TH)and had the same music composer(Harry Manfredini)which also did the music scoring for most of the FRIDAY THE 13TH installments as you may notice, especially during the major action scenes that are violent.

HOUSE also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was still living in the Imperial Valley when HOUSE had its theatrical release in the Spring of 1986 when I was in 7th grade at Wilson Jr. High School in my hometown(El Centro, CA).

It's just too bad that HOUSE 2:THE SECOND STORY wasn't as good as this one was, but I'm sure part of the reason why HOUSE II wasn't as good as the original was probably due to the fact that since HOUSE 2 was Rated PG-13 instead of Rated R like HOUSE I, which resulted in HOUSE II having a lot less action and a lot less violence than the original along with the fact that sequels usually never measure up to the originals either, especially since they don't make sequels like they used to, unlike HALLOWEEN 2, FRIDAY THE 13TH:PART II, and PSYCHO 2 for instance which were all very exceptional sequels and probably the best sequels of all time.",1386720000,4,2137,4.7238605898123325

4552376,5,B0053TWVK0,"And you thought your house was weird!

 In the top three of my favorite horror comedies of all time, House brings back fond memories of childhood. I used to watch this religiously, entertained by the grim humor, the outlandishly gory villians and the juicy plot. Not being able to watch much horror at a younger age due to parental restrictions, this one fell through the cracks as being ""allowed."" Even my mother found it amusing, and this is a woman who hates her horror.

 The plot is pretty simple, but in a way it isn't. There are some nice twists and turns, and this movie is chock full of jump-at you scares and cheesy B horror. We have clever backflashes throughout showing Roger's time in the war for his current book, but eventually these flashbacks take on new meaning and even more bizarre things start to happen.

 Let me sad one thing - this house is terrific. Doorways and other dimensions through bathroom cabinets, possessed gory creatures with tight skimpy dresses, skeletons that come flying out of the closet - you name it, it's there. Some nice gore throughout helps the movie run along even more.

 The music choice is hilarious. Comically enhanced eerie themes, as well as some nice classical oldies when the time is right. (Such as when Roger decides to bury something particularly unpleasant in the backyard.)

 The cast couldn't be better. We have the curly blonde, blue eyed actor William Katt, (the unlucky soul who brings Carrie to the prom) to take the lead. He's convincing in this role and even better acting than in Carrie. As I said in that review I would have liked to see more of him in films. He seems to have a natural way about him on screen. Cheers regular George Wendt is the nosy and lovable neighbor Harold who adds some of the funniest scenes in the movie. Roger's ex wife Sandy is played by Kay Lenz, although she doesn't play that large of a part, unless its' her alter ego (wink).

 The neighbor is gorgeous as hell and I don't know where she comes from; whether in life she's some sort of playboy celebrity or what I have no idea, but she definitely has the looks and the shape. Richard Moll (yes, the tall guy from Night Court, Bull) is here as well but in a completely different role - crude and downright cranky. I don't want to spoil too much about any of the cast but they definitely draw the eye, and Big Ben is one of the best. His presence on screen is perfect. We definitely get the goods in the way of acting here.

 The screenwriter for this film (Fred Dekker) also cranked out Night of the Creeps and the Monster Squad; you'll recognize the works of the director Steve Miner in Friday the 13th 2 and 3, Halloween H20 (don't hold this against him!), Lake Placid, and 1989s' Warlock. Although this movie is entirely different from any of the above. Producer is none of than Sean S. Cunningham of the original Friday the 13th.

 I haven't seen a film like it elsewhere, and its' poorly mentioned or reviewed. You owe it to yourself to see house - a movie with genuine humor and a ticket to a good time.",1379635200,2,3059,4.484684684684685

4552389,4,B0053TWVK0,"'Ding Dong, You're Dead!' HOUSE is a wacky special effects show that stars CARRIE's William Katt as Horror novelist Roger Cobb, who has moved into his aunt's creepy old house to finish work on his latest novel. While there, he discovers that the house is actually a gateway to another dimension, a dimension filled with ghouls and ghosts! HOUSE teams several unsung heroes of Horror together to create a campy cult-comedy, including writer Fred Dekker (NIGHT OF THE CREEPS), director Steve Miner (FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2), and producer Sean S. Cunningham (FRIDAY THE 13TH). William Katt is great in the lead, and brings out the silliness of the script perfectly without going too far over-the-top. He faces off with the towering Richard Moll as Cobb's zombified army buddy Ben, who apparently wasn't too happy about being left behind in the jungles of Vietnam. The excellent costume work that brings Ben back from the dead is what most fans will remember from the film, while most of the other rubbery monster designs are rather far-fetched and goofy looking. The old Victorian house also offers tons of personality, and makes for a great interdimensional portal. With tons of frights and laughs, HOUSE is sure to entertain fans of 80's Horror!

When I saw this was available, I put it on my watch list and made my family watch it with me because I remembered loving it when I was a kid.  It was still great, but is not really a scary movie for an adult.  It's a bit much for younger kids.

Not super high on the scare factor, but it has a certain mad intensity that you enjoy.
