8108207,5,B00091RN4G,"This is a great fun movie from the early 80's when film makers were willing to show a little, or a lot of, skin. The improbable ""plot"" such as it is, has three beautiful girls going to the Florida Keys to claim a yacht one of them had inherited, and being thwarted by a sleazy lawyer. Jennifer Inch is one of the most beautiful women to hit the screen, and we get to see every round inch of Inch. The ending is no surprise, but we have a lot of fun along the way. One of the best! The sequel, Soft Touch II is just as good. Both should be on DVD!",1351728000,,546,3.8839285714285716
