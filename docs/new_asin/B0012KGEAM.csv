Three guys in the kitchen, who obviously are great friends collaborate on Italian dishes and have a lot of fun doing it. This Video is such a departure from the sterile cooking shows you'll see on TV.",1203638400,4,352,4.587301587301587
3090772,5,B0012KGEAM,"I puchased what the dvd said it was, Cooking and Cursing Italian food.  It was fun.  You must have SOME kitchen skills to follow it. It reminded me of growing up on the East Coast. Anyone who can't follow it has to be an Idiot!",1203638400,5,227,4.022222222222222
3090773,1,B0012KGEAM,"I saw the preview for this on youtube, and i thought it was pretty funny so i came to amazon to buy the dvd.  when it arrived i couldn't wait to pop it in the dvd player and watch it in full.  bottom line- it sucks.  the production value is equivalent to a father taking video of his toddler's soccer game with a 8mm video camera.  sound and picture quality both suck.  not to mention its not even that funny, its more frustrating than funny.  i kept waiting for something to laugh at, or at least a good shot of the food they were cooking.  it moves at a pace of a turtle and the jokes or laughable incidences are few and far between, alot of cursing which i have no problem with but it seems like this is what they were banking on.  it really is like one of your friends put it together who had no previous credentials as a director or even has ever been around a video camera.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!, Go to youtube and watch the trailer, thats as good as it gets.  the recipes are not even that great, im only half italian and i can cook alot better than these clowns (and im talking genuine italian dishes).  the dvd is one of those recordable ones that anyone can buy at office depot or staples, this was obviously done with someones personal computer.  trust me-you will be disappointed, very disappointed.
final thought-worst purchase i have ever made.",1203292800,3,1363,4.301960784313725

8246406,2,B0012KGEAM,"I watched pieces of it on youtube before purchasing it, and they were very funny! When we watched the dvd that i gave to my dad for a Christmas present, we were all disappointed. those were the only funny parts! the video quality was pretty poor, and it was very short. not to mention, the meal they cooked was nothing special and they didn't even explain well how to cook it. they did seem like they loved what they do, but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, which is upsetting!",1232236800,,481,4.355555555555555

8246408,5,B0012KGEAM,"Italo-Americano Culture at its best!! These guys are hilarious and I never get sick of their crazy antics!!!  This DVD is definitely worth it AND the recipes work as well.  I'm patiently awaiting the next one coming out soon.  NOTE:  If you go to their personal website the DVD will be cheaper, sorry Amazon.",1225152000,,308,4.648148148148148
8246409,5,B0012KGEAM,"I purchased this dvd about a month ago. These guys are hilarious. I was laughing so hard my cheeks were hurting!!! Even if Im not cooking, I watch it for the entertainment alone. I made a few of these recipes and I don't know which one I liked more. For example,I made the meatloaf for my family, I knew I wasn't going to eat it because I don't think there's anyone out there who hates meatloaf more then I do. My family loved it and my husband insisted I try it so I did. OMG It was to die for. I made Pasta's chicken it was amazing!!!! The tomato/eggplant appetizer was spectacular. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys cooking. And even if you dont, the DVD is so easy to follow that even if you cant cook,your food will taste great. I understand that everyone has there own opinion on things,but the first review from Luke stated that the DVD was a waste of money....but since the proceeds go to the less unfortunate,how can that be a waste of money? Being a mother of a child with a disability it's nice to know that there are some people out there who care enough to put the well being of others before their own.
Thank You,

8246410,4,B0012KGEAM,Cooking and Cursing is absolutely hilarious. You will have fun watching these three guys bust each other's balls while arguing in the kitchen. The 'chefs' are easy to relate to and the recipes are simple to follow. Cooking and Cursing blends the best elements of Reality TV and Cooking Shows.,1203724800,,292,4.86
8246411,4,B0012KGEAM,"I have this DVD and I have enjoyed it each time i have seen it. The recipes are fantastic and delicious. I laugh at the spontaneity of the dvd. If someone is expecting a rehearsed  major studio video than you may be disapointed. However, all in all a great time. I have tried the recipes on a few friends and they all loved how it turned out. I do totally disagree with the review given by ""Luke""",1203724800,,396,4.142857142857143
