261988,3,6300184803,"Cheech & Chong officially split after they appeared in AFTER HOURS (1985). It wasn't until 1997 (12 years later) during the ""Wild Card"" episode of the CBS tv series ""Nash Bridges"" did they reunite in a professional way. This Cheech & Chong ""Get Out Of My Room"" (1985) is all recorded on professional video. It plays like a documentary where Cheech wants to do a music video ""Get Out Of My Room"", but Chong just wants to talk to girls. Actually, this is Richard ""Cheech"" Marin's first time as Director. ""Elvira"" Cassandra Peterson has a cameo appearance as well as Beverly D'Angelo and Jan Michael Vincent. Includes the hit video ""Born In East LA"" which was a take-off from the original tune ""Born In The USA"" by Bruce Springsteen. Both Cheech Marin and Bruce Springsteen have credit for ""Born In East LA"". The weird ""Love Is Strange"" video also included in this video.",1050969600,9,868,4.6797385620915035
261989,5,6300184803,"This has nothing to do with any of their earlier comedy flicks. It's just a music movie. It's not their typical pothead comedey UP IN SMOKE. So if you don't like their music don't buy this moive. But overall I liked the music, and it's got my favorite actor Tommy Chong.",991526400,4,270,4.313725490196078

262030,1,6300184803,Dvd did not work at all. Brand new my ass. Not wasting my time sending it back. I'll just spend my money elsewhere.,1397260800,,115,4.043478260869565
262031,4,6300184803,"wasn't exactly what i had expected.
rather interesting.
it will still be part of my cheech and chong movie collection.",1396310400,,118,4.95
262033,3,6300184803,"Released by MCA Records in 1985, Cheech & Chong's GET OUT OF MY ROOM (MCA-5640) is nominally the soundtrack to a running gag music video that's very different from this record. Both do however give a final bow to some of their old characters before the two funnymen went their separate ways.

Cheech Marin directed the 53 minute film and also dominates here. Tommy Chong seems content with playing variations of his laid-back ""Man"" character.

""SIDE"" NOTES--

ONE -- 1.) ""Boss"" take-off has an L.A. Mex/Am slant. 2.) Campus D.J. with a speech impediment argues with his board op about what records they'll broadcast on a closed-circuit radio show. 3.) Chong leaves messages during this answering machine song. 4.) Accountant from Wisconsin meets ""Mr. Brownstain"" at a Japanese restaurant. 5.) More college D.J. silliness. 6.) Cheech has a phone chat with an unheard girl above a very electronic music backing. 7.) Sign-off.

TWO -- 1.) Blind Melon Chitlin's cover of the Muddy Waters classic, Takes 179 and 180. / Tyrone Shoelaces (of ""Basketball Jones"" fame) does a fey falsetto version. 2.) Liverpool's own Ian Rotten gives a guitar lesson to an idiot who electrocutes himself on a shorted-out synthesizer. 3.) and 4.) A 5 AM phone call to the Hollywood star. 5.) ""Juan Likehell, your Southern California Coyote dealer."" 6.) Stupid McCupid and Early Wynn's news show leads with the music lesson tragedy. 7.) ""The very first heavy metal snuff tune.""

262038,3,6300184803,"Here in Australia this is available now on DVD!!! Tho i'm pretty disapointed with it. I had it for year's on the end of somthing else on VHS but I ran out of room on the VHS and never got to see how it ended... and I was sadened to know that my VHS version was only missing probably the last 3 minute's of the film, or the final song :(
Paying $16 Australian is not too bad. But it really saden'd me to find out it all only run's for about 50 minute's!!!! It dosent even go for an hour :( Please, If Universal ever read this, and you sometime in the future plan a release of this on DVD in the USA, then don't put it as it's own DVD, make it a bonus feature with another great Cheech & Chong film, 50 minute's is more a bonus material length man, not a DVD on it's own.
This look's like it was made for MTV or somthing? It's the last hurrah from Cheech Marion and Tommy Chong, it strays alot from any of the previous films, but it has it's moments! It basicly is kind of an interveiw with them, but on there terms, As they have produced a new album, and now they wanna make a video to it... there's some funny stuff in there, somtimes i never know if there serios on some things, or if it was planned, or rehersed, or just did it on the spot? But really, If Americans get a propper release of this on DVD, then I'd rather know it was a bonus feature on somthing. A 50 minute long movie with no captions & no bonus features is not worth having on it's own seperate issue. t should be a bonus feature!",1087430400,,1499,3.966887417218543
