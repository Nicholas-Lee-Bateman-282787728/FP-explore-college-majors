It's a playboy production, but it taks pride in providing a well told story, filled with a good plot, twists, and turns. If you like a modern day noir...and can handle a fair share of nudity, I highly recommend this.",1519516800,,390,4.283783783783784

7792673,4,0792845676,"As far as movies go, The Beneficiary was...okay.  I have no strong opinions of the movie, save one:  Stacy Haiduk makes it worthwhile.  Hey, what can I say?  I fell in love with her, bright eyes and bright ""red"" hair then, on the 90's live action SUPERBOY TV series.  Ever since then, although she's toned down her hair colour, if I can find a movie with Stacy in it, or an episode of a TV series, I'm certain to get it.  So if you like Stacy, this 59-year-old adolescent encourages you to get The Beneficiary.  And if you can find Luther The Geek...well, let's just say you get to see a little more of her in this off beat movie than you ever saw in SUPERBOY! ;-)

I was also very happy with the condition of the videotape and the quickness and efficiency with which the seller got it to me.  All in all a very pleasant experience.  And, um, Stacy, if you are reading this (like, yeah, right, sure she is) I was wondering...is it possible that you are a the beautiful younger woman with a grandfather fetish that I've been hoping to meet?  Hey...guy's got to take his shot!",1277683200,,1074,4.293532338308458

7792675,1,0792845676,"I don't know about anybody else, but when I rent (or purchase, in this case) a movie that has anything to do with Playboy, I'm pretty much looking for one type of movie.  I don't really care about the plot, I don't care about the musical score, nor do I care about the acting.  Which is good, because all of the above were crummy.  Stacy Haiduk and Ron Silver appeared to give some form of effort, but everyone else, even Suzy Amis (granddaughter in Titanic), appeared to be sleepwalking through their roles.
 I've always been an admirer of Stacy Haiduk, ever since her days on SeaQuest.  I thought:  Stacy Haiduk in a Playboy film!  How can it go wrong?  Well, it did.  Terribly so.  Yes, Stacy Haiduk is gorgeous, but she has all of three sex scenes, only one with any nudity at all (a couple of topless shots, nothing great).  And it's not well done nudity -- she doesn't even look that good. There is only one other (very brief) sex scene in the entire film.  Unless there are entirely new scenes inserted into the film, it's fairly obvious there is no unrated version either.
 I'll confess to having bought the movie for skin and gotten virtually none.  I didn't buy the movie for its storyline or acting, but those were even worse.  Skip this one.",982627200,11,1253,4.458149779735683
7792676,1,0792845676,"I'm a retired law enforcement guy.  There is a murder and the first thing I'd do is look for is ""who get's the money"".  The title is ""The Beneficiary.""  In this movie they never tell you who get's  the money.  They know, but never tell you until the movie is 3/4 over ]bad  investigators I'd say]  and you're supposed to be hooked on how good the  female part of the detective's act is.  She's blonde [In a Playboy Made  Movie] so that's explains it, but then you see her acting smart yet totally  missing the point.  This is a Playboy movie and of course seeing the Logo  you have to realize that blondes are bimbo's.  It sells magazines, but it  didn't sell me.  Les Barba",951782400,7,674,4.272
