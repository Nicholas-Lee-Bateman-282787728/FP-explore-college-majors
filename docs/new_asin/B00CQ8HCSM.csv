5734590,5,B00CQ8HCSM,i knew i'd love this movie since i saw the trailer a year ago. it did not let me down. it's a visually striking and audacious exploration of a woman in peril as she looks for love in all the wrong places. what a movie!,1378771200,3,218,3.8666666666666667
5734591,1,B00CQ8HCSM,"Very little to recommend in this slow moving film unless you think you might enjoy scenes of pervasive nudity involving out-of-shape overweight Austrian women who appear to be in their 50's.  Seems to be more of a comical farce than anything else, although it does have a few serious moments.  Even for mature devotees of foreign films, I just don't believe this movie will have very much appeal.",1378771200,2,396,4.8088235294117645
5734592,4,B00CQ8HCSM,"This movie starts off with Teresa (Margaret Tiesel) saying goodbye to her daughter who is lying on her bed playing with her cell phone.  It is obvious that her daughter finds Teresa an annoyance.  Their relationship seems fraught with disconnection and Teresa leaves for her vacation in Kenya on that note.  Once in Kenya, Teresa seems enamored of the country and the beautiful weather along with her hotel.  The other women she meets tell her about the men they have been having sex with - young Africans who they meet at the beach or in town.  She sees that one of her new friends has purchased a motorbike for her 'boyfriend' and this surprises Teresa.  Teresa, at first, is totally against finding a lover.  Gradually, she succumbs to the idea and tries to have sex with a man she meets.  She can not go through with it as it seems too perfunctory.

This movie examines the morphing of Teresa from a prudish Austrian tourist to a woman who opens up to her sensuality with the young African men she takes to bed.  It also shows her increasing knowledge of the psychological and fiscal cost of these encounters.  Her 'lovers' want money for different things: their sick nephews, their ill fathers, etc.  She realizes at one point that she is being used and lied to and gets furious with the man, berating and even physically battering him.

This is a hard movie to watch.  As Teresa becomes aware of the real cost of fulfilling her sexuality, she goes through stages and then partakes of what is expected in this culture of self-fulfillment.  There is much frontal nudity which may be difficult for some people to watch.  There are also many painful emotional scenes that make this movie dark and despairing.  I found that the title hinted at what Teresa hoped for but never did find.  I liked the movie but cringed a lot throughout it.  It is not a movie for everyone.  The plot is not action filled but is slow and filled with a deep nod to Teresa's experiences.  Overall, it is a fine movie that left me emotionally spent.  The movie is originally in German and has sub-titles.",1377475200,14,2082,4.585365853658536

5734594,4,B00CQ8HCSM,"Paradise (German: Paradies) is the collective name of three films directed by Ulrich Seidl: Paradise: Love (2012), Paradise: Faith (2012) and Paradise: Hope (2013). They focus on three women from one family; one of them travels to Kenya as a sex tourist, one has to spend time at a weight loss camp, and one tries to propagate Catholicism. Three women set out to fulfil their unfulfilled dreams and longings. Paradise is the promise of a state of permanent happiness.as well as a commonly abused concept in the tourism industry. These are 3 women from one family,two sisters and a daughter. The method is to shoot fiction films in a documentary setting,so that unexpected moments of reality can meld with the fiction. The film is shot in original locations. The cast consists of actors and non-actors,setting up a certain tension. All 3 films tell stories that are fictions but had,as a starting point, personal observations,experiences and encounters with others. They both draw on reality and reinvent it. Each film can work as a stand-alone piece or connect as part of a triptych. Seidl has revealed a preoccupation with sex and prostitution in his films and documentaries. These three women have low market value,so they look for love elsewhere. For him for whom corporality plays an important role,its in the unbeautified you find beauty.

Seidls aim is authenticity,yet you wonder how say he set up the 1st film,Paradise: Love,where sugar mamas,over 50s Austrian women,partaking of sex tourism, look for love and sex with the beach boys,who are all non-actors,give them love in exchange for money,a form of global prostitution. There are scenes of embarrassment for the beach boys(as well as the excellent actor playing Teresa),where you thought the global sex trade operates in 3rd World countries for western tourists. For the beach boys,love is business,and they have wives and children to support. Similarly,Seidl takes the three theological virtues and transposes them into the modern world,shorn of all their metaphysical connotations,despite the middle film,Paradise:Faith depicting a Catholic fundamentalist,who does missionary work during her vacation,so that Austria may be brought back to the path of virtue. She targets immigrants. Shes seenstruggling to convert an alcoholic Russian prostitute. She carries a two foot high statue of the Virgin Mary from door to door. Her real struggle begins when her husband,an Egyptian Muslim,after years of absence,confined to a wheelchair, comes home. She only has love for Jesus,and prefers masturbation with a cross to sex with her husband. Such a battle between the estranged couple ensues over his rights as a married man and their differences of religious belief. This was my favourite of the 3 films due to the beautiful way each scene is shot,almost perfect,and the strength of subject matter,the acting.

Seidl does not write dialogue,although his films are based on scripts,but the settings,pre-production and what comes out during filming,leads to a certain measure of improvisation. Seidl seems to want to disturb or discomfort the viewer. Hes a provocateur, delving into Austrias psyche,in a confrontative manner,crafting a state of the nation work of art. His cameras gaze is unflinching, straddling fiction and non-fiction, in an age of globalisation,exploring the consumerist ethos where the West can buy anything. He wants viewers to identify with his hapless protagonists. Anna Marias self flagellation,though medieval,is believable. He asks a lot of the actors. Melanie (Lenz) ,the overweight adolescent,trying to lose weight at the boot camp in Paradise: Hope, develops a crush on the camp doctor,theres no overt sexuality in their encounters. You feel he is sending up Austrias past through the militaristic PT intructors. There is a lot of humour in all 3 films,even if its of a scabrous kind: If you're happy and you know it,clap your fat! as the teenage dieters sing in a group in English. All 16 camp inmates perform under their real names. Lenz had experienced an actual Diatcamp prior to being cast. All 3 films take place over the same summer. The recurring motif in Love,where an emotionally bereft Teresa tries and fails to reach Melli on the phone,counterpointed by Mellis own attempts to ring her mother for emotional reassurance. Her auntie at the start of the film(the one in Faith) is shown taking her to the camp. Not always easy to watch but rewarding,when you realize that Seidl is one of those pathfinder film makers, attempting to make such films.",1407542400,,4543,5.239010989010989
5734595,3,B00CQ8HCSM,A fascinating study of older european women who are calorically challenged who believe they are unfairly judged by european men and cannot get a date in europe go sex vacationing in tanzania at resort where for just a few euros they can have sex with locals.

As for the movie itself, it screams of sadness, immaturity, prostitution, poverty and so much more.  I should have read the comments prior to watching.  I understand that some prostitution is by choice, however that does not make this movie any more easy to watch.  It brings into play the fact that being poverty ridin brings out the best and more often than not, the worst in people.  I have traveled to many places such as this around the world and still find it hard to see how ""rich white women"" (or anyone else with money) will abuse another human being with sex.  There is testimony from many local Kenyans that they ""enjoy"" living a higher end lifestyle being all they have to do is entertain and have sex, however there are many more that do not.  The ones with husbands and wives at home waiting for them.

5734606,5,B00CQ8HCSM,"ULRICH SEIDL'S WORK is the kind of film I'll drive miles to see and spend lots of time thinking about what the ""artist"" hoped to share with me, tell me, teach me and I have to decide if it is just voyerism or pornography or someone trying to produce something provocative and failed.  I'll begin by saying ''PARADISE HOPE''  is a given--young girl behaving dumb because she is a young girl but psychiatrists will say she is behaving that way because her father is not in the picture: she and her mother are like: ""girls gone wild"".  (How come I understand that?)

The only thing provocative about this part of the triology is the last scenes in the forest when the man from the tavern took her there and laid her down.  I held my breathe and said, ""Dumb man all the way through that.""  But then, that was ""MAN'S"" time to shine or falter in Seidl's lense and MAN does falter like in all the other segments of this triology with the lense on women.  THAT'S what Seidl's work does.  You can't glass it over.  When we (the voyeurs) are forced to see stuff that is not meant for us to see, stuff we call personal, what he is saying and what he is showing is what we are doing on a daily basis when we think no one (who knows us) is watching.  We do things we don't want to get out.

ANOTHER SEGMENT OF THE TRIOLOGY is: ""PARADISE-FAITH""...What is a woman to do when she has everything she needs at forty and her husband is not around for two years.  Well, her big house is immaculate.  That means it is time to get up and go out in the community, in the world, and find something else to do.  Then... there is the bright idea to change religious faith and become swept away with divine zeal.  And in doing so, get so caught up in it that she falls in love with Jesus in more than one way.  She loves him so that she wishes he could be her MAN in all ways.  But, not in the dirty ways, of course, so she takes a hot bath and scrubs herself to make sure she has all the ''natural'' dirt off of her.  She will be with Jesus on a ""pure"" and ""perfect"" level that defies natural proclivities.  I've seen this behavior, have read about it, and history has lots of stories and tales and legends to inform anyone who is interested.  It appears to be a syndrome that is much like the syndrome that women go into to prostitute on their own BUT this is the opposite of that pathology.  It's like the prostitute gives up hope and drive and decides to stay down-low and the zealot raises hope and drive and determination to go up high and live with Jesus very personally.  That can  end up being pathological too.  So, what is Seidl saying about women, all women in this triology-----ARE ALL WOMEN CAPABLE OF WHAT HE DISPLAYS?  IF NOT EXACTLY, BUT SOMETHING NEARLY LIKE IT???  Well.  That's something you would have to talk about and discuss.  That's something you would have to decide and change your mind back and forth about...but you won't forget what you saw in Seidl's Triology.  Saying its disgusting work, amaturish work, won't end the battle in your mind as to why it does appear as if he is glorifying broken, sad people but then you begin to see broken sad people all around you and wonder if you're not broken and sad too.  AND I SAY WE ALL ARE....(at times)

""PARADISE: LOVE"" was pushed squarely in my face and I had to acknowledge it.  Because when I find myself in movies or books, music and art, and even law, I embrace  the parts of my being thinking I will be able to integrate the parts and know them all as ME.  And I tell you that Margarethe Tiesel brought that home to me.  Her performance was off the chart.  She made it all so real, not ideal at all.  It was raw, in your face REAL.  Her need(s) is real; her need is real in all women???
(That's a question.)  But I'm not likely to go to a foreign country myself and follow strangers like that.  But... have I done 'Vacation Love'?  Welll yes....there was this symphony conductor under the New England moonlight....

PARADISE LOVE is hard to take for most people.  So many things are going on at once.  Everything we see jars our sense of reality.  Especially the reality we call: MORALS!  Two ''worlds'' meet, WE LIKE TO THINK: one black, one white and yet they come together in a direct raw way with ''new rules'', NEW MORALS.  And the new rules say: ""I'm in business and you're a customer.  You have need of me and that is obvious to everyone; depend on me; trust me; I will take care of you like you want and need to be taken care of.  I promise.  I will do my best to make you happy with my service but at the end of the day I want you to give me money.  I want you to give my family money because I serviced your need for love and attention.  I am working.  I am earning money for my family. My wife is very angry that I do this but she does not turn down the money you give her.  I will do what you want but I do have my limits.  There are some things I will not do even for money.""

''Teresa'' cries at the end.  WHY DOES Teresa cry?  Ask women everywhere: Why is Teresa crying and I say it has nothing to do with the people who provided services for her: I think its because it is her birthday and she has not gotten a call from the one person she thought would call her and send her love---HOME did not call her; she called home and begged home to call but home did not call.  I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE--I THINK ALL WOMEN KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE  and that WILL break you down and make you cry.  It does feel like: NOBODY LOVES ME, NOBODY CARES...but that is usually and most likely not true.  Such is the ""creature condition"" in the natural body...so then we break down and have a good cry.

THANK YOU ULRICH SEIDL...I don't know if you intended this kind of depth and perspective--maybe you're just a storyteller that tells clearly what he sees when people think nobody is watching.

5734613,4,B00CQ8HCSM,"Paradise: Love feels like a documentary about sex tourism in Africa. The cinematography is superb, the atmosphere makes you feel as if you are on vacation as well, and the dialogues feel like real conversations that are both shallow and meaningful at the same time. Sure, it is slow, but it is such a realistic film that I did not want it to end.

Teresa is an Austrian, middle-aged woman who goes to a resort in Kenya to spend a vacation. There she meets other Austrian women like her: unfit, with low self-esteem and hungry for love. Teresa starts meeting local men who ""love"" her for who she really is, and this is when we really start knowing everybody for who they really are.

At times funny, at times sad, this film makes you ponder about the emotional poverty of some people and the economic poverty of some other. When both of these kinds of poverties meet, rather than complement each other, they leave you feeling more void and poor of what you thought you originally were.

This movie has been compared to ""Heading South"", but while both films are about sex tourism (""Heading South"" is set in Haiti), their plots are different. I am looking forward to watching Paradies: Faith and Paradise: Hope.",1389484800,5,1208,4.635514018691588
5734614,5,B00CQ8HCSM,He was light years before his time.  Still the same feeling seeing it as I did in my youth. His actors were all so credible.,1388534400,,124,3.96
5734615,4,B00CQ8HCSM,"At this point, ""very interesting"" is all I can come up with.  Perhaps later I'll be able to be more articulate.

 I'll try---first off, the lead actress is amazing!  Not only her fearlessness in showing her body but also in showing the full range of her emotions.  Mostly, what she impressed me with was her innocence.  The other Austrian tourists she met were more or less jaded in their expectations of getting sex for money from these African young men.  This woman, our heroine, was actually looking for love.  It amazed me how many times she tried, again and again, to find love with these fellows who were clearly doing what they were doing for money.  I was also amazed at her naive, but genuine sweetness, as when she met the young ""sister"" of her first lover and the school children.  I also have to give her credit for her dancing...she managed some great moves, there.

What emerged for me, was a picture of a genuinely sweet, but muddled middle class, middle-aged Austrian woman, who could have been any woman from any Western country, as she looked for love.  The opening scene shows her at her job which is as a teacher of developmentally disabled adults.  She clearly has a big heart.  She's not married, her teenage daughter would rather talk on the phone than to her, there is no man in sight, she is rather obsessive about cleanliness.  She thinks she is old and fat but she'd really like to believe that she is still desirable.  It's all so terribly typical of a lot of women....maybe men, too.

Besides the bald picture of the game of prostitution and mutual exploitation, there is this unexpected beauty that the film shows.  The beach at Kenya is gorgeous although studded with men waiting to sell themselves to the female tourists.  What struck me was the unexpected beauty of the tiny homes of the African men....especially that of ""Mumba,"" her first ""boyfriend,""  His room, although very humble was quite beautiful.  I loved the prints of the fabrics, the colors of the walls, the sheer lavender net that fell over the bed/  Was this for mosquitoes?  Maybe...but when he unfolded it and she lay in it, the scene was quite beautiful. Rodin would have loved her! The scene of Mumba, stretched out, nude, on the bed, was quite splendid, too.  She recorded this with her cell phone which was terrible funny and just, terrible,  But at the same time, he was so beautiful, that you couldn't blame her.

I think it is this position of the film maker -- of objectivity---non-judgement as he showed what the poor Black African men did and what the middle class White Austrian women did that give this film it's value.  He doesn't spare us any of the details but even the most bald nude scenes are shown with such honesty that I found it all quite amazing.  Obviously every viewer will see this differently, some with moral judgment, some with shock, some with sociological tsk-tsk-ing.  For me, it's just quite amazing. I am reminded of a line from a Tennessee Williams play, that ""nothing human is disgusting.""  I look forward to seeing the rest of this film maker's Paradise trilogy.",1388361600,3,3101,4.667896678966789
5734616,4,B00CQ8HCSM,"Paradise: Love chronicles tragi-comic escapades of Teresa, a lonely single mother's vacation in Kenya (I believe) leaving behind an indifferent teenage daughter in her native Austria.

As I watched the action unfold, I wasn't sure what was going on:  Is it a scripted movie or is it a candid documentary? Regardless of its genre, Paradise: Love depicts Teresa's slow, faltering metamorphosis from a woman who fought off the sexual advances of an ardent young African man to her final transformation as a clumsy unsuccessful seducer of yet another African young man. Teresa is goaded into her sexual exploits by three fellow randy, giddy Austrian women who appear as old hands in their  objectification of poor African boys on the make much in the same way middle-aged men objectify willing young women. Poor Teresa, however, gets the formula wrong as she quizzes one of her suitors-for-hire about his ""love"" for her. As I watched Teresa, grinning from ear to ear, desperate to appear pleasant, shambling down one dark street after the other alone or in the company of some man she'd met only minutes ago, I anticipated her being mugged, raped, or flat-out disappearing; her corpse washing up on the shore some weeks later. Thankfully, none of my grim imaginings came to pass.

The ending was most poignant and telling:  Teresa's lone plump silhouette trudging along in the sands while a gaggle of young male figures turn somersaults in the opposite direction.

This is not a victimless crime because the targets are male because they really need the money and these women are really toxic.  It's not their appearance which highlights the hypocrisy of their claim that they just want someone to see their inner beauty - but they are not choosing their prostitutes based on inner beauty.  In all their choices, their possessions, they are furiously denying their reality.  They would be less horrible if they hired these Third Worlders to be their inexpensive personal trainers while on holiday so they can return to their empire a few dress sizes smaller.

And what is up with not wanting to pay them and forcing them to make up my brother is in the hospital stories.  I don't know when one is going to kill the other.  The relationships between the women and the locals are really not benevolent at all.  This has reported as to be going on in Egypt, Haiti, Dominican Republic and here Kenya and I wonder why they are picking on the Southern Hemisphere and it seems Black males in particular.  Is this a substitute to SLAVERY???

In some ways, this help to highlight how bad it must be when their male counterparts visit Thailand and the Dominican Republic.  That must be more openly menacing but this is also a pretty dire scene.

This is NOT GOOD.

From Andrea Dworkin:

 The Nazi invasion of the human body--the literal and metaphoric castration of subjugated men, the specter of the sexualized, tortured. emaciated ""Jewess,"" mass plundered, mass murdered--is still the touchstone for an apparently depoliticized social sadism, a fetishized rapism that normalizes sexual humiliation and mass dehumanization.

Her conundrum was that she wanted to be seen for more than just a body, yet that is all she could see in her male playmates.  Being unwilling to see men as more than a body, each encounter with a new man reflected her limited perspective on men.  She would scold and instruct her male playmates if they didn't treat her as something more than a body.  It was particularly bizarre to watch her complain to her girlfriends that men could not see her for more than a body while that was all she thought they were.
