3153418,5,B001675YZM,I watched this movie last night and i couldn't stop cracking up! I love indie films and this one was a gem! The acting was overall good and the officer Malone character was so over the top but in a good way i almost fell out of my chair laughing! I highly recommend this one to anyone who's interested in dark comedies and slap stick humor!,1211328000,,340,4.166666666666667

8261334,4,B001675YZM,George Speedopoulos is the owner & manager of a failing dollar store.  He decides the best option to turn his life around is kill his wife and collect on the million dollar insurance policy he has on her.  But he dies instead and ends up in Purgatory which naturally takes the form or what he hates the most.  His dollar store.  This film is clearly low budget.  But in my opinion they do actually make some good choices about the characters and plot.  So by the end of the movie I liked it.  Just a heads up.  This movie does have a gag reel at the end of it.  If you make it through the movie it is worth viewing.  'Dollgatory' is free with Amazon Prime so it is definitely worth viewing in my opinion.,1485388800,,704,4.148148148148148
8261335,1,B001675YZM,"One of the worst films I's seen in a long time - in fact can't remember ever wasting my time to watch that was worse.  First, let me say that I appreciate bad films - the ones that are so unintentionally bad - that they are strangely good. (Example Plan 9 from Outer Space).  But this film is so bad, I can't but help to wonder if it was intentionally bad.  T^he acting was absolutely miserable, the set consisted of only two spots - the inside and outside of a Dollar Store , and someones relatively nice apartment.  And to make it even more confusing there was a religious spin and message on it that I'm still not certain was intentional or for yuks.  (I'm leaning towards intentional, though)  Combine religion and lots of swearing  and I'm not certain anyone can figure out what this film is about.  Remember this film is bad - and I don't mean anywhere in a good way.",1481760000,,873,4.3128834355828225
