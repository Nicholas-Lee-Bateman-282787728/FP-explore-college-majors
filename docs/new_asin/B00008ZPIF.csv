7988331,3,B00008ZPIF,"First and foremost I have to say that the stunts performed throughout the whole DVD are some of the craziest I've seen. There's high-speed stand-up, one-legged, one-handed wheelies, cross-handed tank-sitting stopies and acrobatics including a jump from one bike to another without a pilot! These guys know what they are doing and they take your casual wheelly and stoppy way beyond the next level. Terrific stuff. The editing of the scenes, on the other hand, leaves you asking for so much more. The scenes are just too quick to fully appreciate. The editors have included selected scenes from previous X-Factor productions such as ""Full Leather Jacket"", ""Urban Assault"", ""Moving Violations"" just to name a few and crammed them side by side in flashes that last for 2-3 seconds (for the huge vast majority). Sometimes you don't even get to see the guy fully splatter himself on the asphalt on the occasional mishap. So watching the DVD is like seeing a freight train go by with one scene after the other without fully taking in all the details. The music score is your expected hardcore rock and blends remarkably well with the video. Though I have to tell you that I would appreciate sections with no music just to hear the sweet sound of the bikes roaring by or even the clunk and clatter of a nice fall.
BOTTOM LINE: this DVD is a great showcase of all the other productions they've created, it's like a huge trailer. Personally, I would have preferred buying the lengthier version of a single one. On the other hand, you get to see uncountable stunts even if only for a very short bit.",1086048000,,1589,4.719424460431655

7988333,4,B00008ZPIF,"Unbelievable! If you like Sportbikes and pulling wheelies, these guys are pulling off some of the craziest motorcycle stunts  I've ever seen, and doing them in the most dangerous places. It was exciting all the way through. The best part is the crash section! One dude eats it hard on a crowded freeway and hobbles off and is rushed to the hospital with multiple injuries. I originally purchased this DVD for my husband, but I watch it more than him.",1077321600,,450,4.625
