8674073,1,B00MQSCKNO,"this was the worst put together documentary ever. I am not even sure if it is an original or a pieced together copy. no problems with delivery, but the product was awful.",1513123200,,170,4.34375
8674074,1,B00MQSCKNO,"I love Tom Petty but the quality of the DVD was bad.  Amazon reimbursed me right away, no questions asked.",1467763200,,106,4.3
8674075,1,B00MQSCKNO,No it was horrible. Reminded me of home made film. Filmed on the phone and put on tape. I wish I could return it and order what I really wanted.,1461974400,,144,3.8333333333333335
8674076,1,B00MQSCKNO,This offered nothing that was new or original about Tom Petty. Don't bother buying this product. There are much better DVDs available if you are a Tom Petty fan.,1441238400,,161,4.586206896551724
8674077,1,B00MQSCKNO,AWFUL!  It appears to be a bootleg DVD.,1419811200,4,39,3.875
8674078,1,B00MQSCKNO,"I can only assume the company that produced this needs money badly and hopes to cash in on the TP/HB ""brand's"" popularity.  Most of the clips I'd seen elsewhere with significantly higher video quality, and the few interviews are mostly just cheesy blurbs that add nothing of substance or value.  Aside from brief clips from their MTV videos, the video production values are horrendous, although the sound seems OK.

Unless you're an obsessive collector wanting to leave no available item un-acquired, I'd urge you to rent or otherwise do a total-preview of this mess before buying it.  Mine's heading right back to Amazon, if it's permissible to return opened DVDs for reasons other than broken/failure to play.  Given TP's legendary reputation for artistic integrity, I cannot imagine this was created & released with his authorization or involvement.",1417824000,6,852,5.189781021897811
