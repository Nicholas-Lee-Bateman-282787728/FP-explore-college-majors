8740334,1,B017RR92ZW,i watched the first episode on this series and i hated the program. when they do the flashbacks of finding the place where  the dead person was. they flashback to damn fast and i don't even like that head black woman's  voice. drives me wacky. i know i didn't give it much chance on this series but i can't stand that  woman's voice. so this is a lousy TV series. they move the story to fast also. i lost interest in programs like that.,1535068800,,436,4.166666666666667
