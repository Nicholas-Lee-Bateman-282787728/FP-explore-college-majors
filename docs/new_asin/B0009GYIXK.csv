8060465,2,B0009GYIXK,"This picture was release on February 15 1980 starring Adrienne Barbeau as Beverly McGraw, Bill Daly as Charles and Howard Duff as AJ. Morgan. Beverly McGraw, an advertising exec meets Billy Colorado, a football player, Charles, a minister meets Crystal Kramer, a store clerk and her mother Ida, Robert Murphy, a detective following Beverly, is having trouble avoiding falling for her. Cheryl and Jimmy, staff at the resort assist with the matchmaking activities of their aunt Madge, the operator of the Love Island Resort I bought this because of Adrienne Barbeau hoping to see her in a swimsuit and I was disappointed. This picture was nothing more of a spin-off from the Love Boat and Fantasy Island. Sure scenery was good and drama wasn't bad but I'm getting tired of love and matching shows. Therefore with the disappointment of Adrienne and the lack of action I'm giving this movie just 4 weasel stars.",1390089600,,907,4.934640522875817
