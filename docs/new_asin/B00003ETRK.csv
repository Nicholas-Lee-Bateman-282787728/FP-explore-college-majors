7918650,5,B00003ETRK,"This entry in the Intimate Portrait series is lovingly and carefully produced. The subject is, of course, the loveliest and most elegant lady  ever to grace Hollywood. Miss Donna Reed brought more than charm and beauty  to her many roles. She also brought intelligence, wit, and a remarkable  understanding of human nature to these roles. This video examines her  family life, both in her native Iowa and in California, and her children  speak honestly, yet lovingly, of her as a parent. Her best friend in Iowa  is a refreshingly joyous person and it is easy to see why they were such  close friends. TV daughter Shelley Fabares, long one of this reviewer's  favorite people, is characteristically generous and loving, a continuous  tribute to her great friend and mentor. Lastly, kudos should be given to  this program's director for an exceedingly professional yet compassionate  look at one of America's genuine treasures.",966643200,12,926,5.1066666666666665
