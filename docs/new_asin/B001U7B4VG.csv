This is not a 'song and dance' movie; the music comes from them both being singers. Don't want to give the story away but it was a favorite when I saw it a few years ago and loved seeing it again here. Released in 2008.",1510444800,,376,4.8

8342961,4,B001U7B4VG,"This is a beautiful romance with sensitivity and chemistry between the leads Sonu Sood and Eeesha Koppihkar .
It is about a love story that spans decades. The girl doesn't feel free to marry till she has her 2 siblings grown and established in the world after her parents are gone. He waits for her - though does his best to assist her and stand by her throughout his long waiting for her.
He becomes a successful popular song writer and singer and his songs are about her.
It has a more traditional feel to it though it was made in 2008. It is more about traditional observances rather the glamour, colour and jazz/hip hop feel of other recent more Westernised Bollywood movies.
The subtitles were lyrical poetry that added depth to the feelings conveyed by the leads. I have marked it down to a 4 from a 5 mostly because there was a sameness to the melodies that were long and came almost back-to-back at the beginning. Except for one song (that they promoted the movie with) I didn't find them memorable. Once the subtitles fade the songs weren't then interesting enough to seek out as it was the poetry that spoke through them that made them of interest to me. The sameness and lengthiness of melodies sent my co-watcher into abandoning the movie (she found Eesha a bit too 'studied coy' for too long and was irritated by that - though I thought she was OK and did get more depth as the movie went. However the movie settles down to almost no songs later on. There is no dancing except for a snippet at a wedding.
I was drawn to this movie by the promos and by Sonu Sood who did a memorable job of his secondary role in Jodha Akbar. He has presence and potential and makes a great looking sensitive romantic lead. I had also read some solid reviews by prominent Bollywood critics who saw it as above average.
Eesha was appropriately coy and loving. However when she sang earlier in the movie she didn't match the tone of her facial expressions to the mood of the piece (smiling cheerfully through sad lyrics).
They also didn't age either of them visually through the lengthy courtship. These ended up being minor quibbles of what became a heart felt movie.
The script was fine though the dilemma is at times mystifying for a Westerner who can see solutions that would have prevented their long sacrifice - that they were more condemned to by narrow cultural expectations. Within that culture though we have good people doing their heart-felt best.
I enjoyed this movie (and Sonu who is one to watch in the future). Other 'Net reviews tend to give average to above average.
Recommended for romantics and lovers of more sensitive romantic leads.",1237248000,2,2647,4.574736842105263
