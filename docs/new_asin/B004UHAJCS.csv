8441536,5,B004UHAJCS,"Moana is the second film by Robert Flaherty, the father of the documentary film. His first film was Nanook of the North, which became world-famous (so much so that when Nanook died of starvation two years later it made world headlines). Flaherty's films are feature-length documentaries; that is, they are not story films but more like anthropological studies of interesting people. One must approach them from the point of view of learning about people who live very different lives from us.

Technically, one must also be aware that we are viewing films from the early days of film making, almost 100 years ago now.",1389398400,,617,4.9326923076923075
8441537,2,B004UHAJCS,"Original film is 85 minutes long, this version is only 65 minutes. Film repeated twice on same DVD copy. Quality of DVD copy leaves much to be desired. Looks like a copy made from projecting the film on a screen rather than from original master.",1361404800,4,245,4.466666666666667
