8177153,1,B000NDFHYS,A lot more profound than I remember.  Save your money for something you will watch more than once or twice.  The American Pie movies were more tasteful.,1395532800,,152,4.592592592592593
8177154,5,B000NDFHYS,"The first Lost Reality is funny, but the second is better. Lost Reality is a collection of mock reality show pilots that apparently didn't get chosen to become ongoing reality TV series. They are offensively hilarious, but Lost Reality is probably an acquired taste in it's vulgar humor. Both films are worth buying if you're into a little bit of funny shock value, especially Lost Reality 2.",1362528000,,392,4.865671641791045
8177155,1,B000NDFHYS,"This show was done, I believe, just to show how stupid people can be.  I almost thought everyone's behavior was real, but after while, you can recognize that much of this was probably staged.  I determine this by putting myself in the cameraman's point of view.  Like when the racist was thrown out of the restaurant, beauty parlor, and wherever.  Never did you ever hear anyone say ""You guys need to leave!"" and the such.  Only the racist was thrown out as if there was no cameraman.  Plus, when he's driving a truckload of possible illegal immigrants, he's talking to the cameraman sitting beside him, but when another cameraman catches the truck driving by, you don't see the cameraman in the passenger seat of the truck.  So, this whole stupid fake documentary of challenging human behavior just for laughs, really loses it's credibility.

And when you think of that, then the subjects they chose weren't really funny at all.  This film was just a display of blatant tastelessness.  Put together by a few people who obviously have their own personal problems, and they hope that this film will get an appreciative audience so that they can feel a little less distantly perverted and warped about themselves in real life.",1301097600,,1224,4.813397129186603
8177156,4,B000NDFHYS,So many good pranks and ideas. It's obvious that a bunch of it is staged. They hired porn stars and stand up comics to do some of the stuff. But I must say the best parts are The Amazin' Racist.,1252713600,,194,3.875
8177157,1,B000NDFHYS,"ALthough there are a couple of great pilots on this 2 disc set there aren't enough to warrant spending your money. There is a reason that none of these shows made it to network television, it's absolute rubbish. Borat want to be's with heavily staged antics.",1184630400,,258,4.630434782608695
