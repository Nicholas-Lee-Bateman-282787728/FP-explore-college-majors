1725346,5,B000068ME6,"It's kinda sad when the most recommended comedy movies out there today aren't as entertaining or funny as the low budget Repli-Kate. This movie was funny from beginning to end, and Ali Landry did an amazing job portraying both the feminine original and the masculine clone. I highly recommend this to anybody who loves a good laugh and a good storyline, put together cohesively.",1035849600,4,378,4.921875
1725347,4,B000068ME6,"Haha... I just watched this movie, and was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't know what to expect.  I found myself laughing a lot during the movie ... especially the scenes with Eugene Levy's ""repli-character.""  This movie is basically about a guy who clones a girl he likes (by accident).  He and his friend decide to teach her ""guy stuff"" ... teach her to love football, wrestling, to love to drink bear, have casual sex, etc.  This ""Repli-Kate"" doesn't turn out all that well.  Sure she's hot, just like the original, but she burps and only likes to sit on the couch and eat pizza and watch football ... and she doesn't like ""emotional girly stuff.""  Every guys dream girl, right?  EEEEE... WRONG!  I definitely think Ali Landry did a good job portraying both her regular self and her clone.  I like when they go shopping for bras, and the sales lady asks what size she is, so she pulls up her shirt and exposes her breasts and says, ""I don't know, you tell me.""  All in all I liked the movie.  It had some good laughs, and the concept was pretty inventive.  Good acting.  The ending was great.  I give it a B-.  :)  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a laid-back comedic adventure!",1029456000,4,1190,4.46046511627907
1725348,4,B000068ME6,"If you're the type of guy who watches ""The Man Show"" and professional wrestling on TV and reads magazines like ""FHM"" or ""Maxim"", then by this movie immedaitely.  You'll love this film.  This movie is sort of an upated version of ""Weird Science"" for the guys who were the right age to love that movie when it came out in the 80s.
  Just like ""Weird Science"", there's the nice guy and his  somewhat funny and somewhat annoying friend.  Instead of being kids in high school they now work in a lab at a University (I think they filmed it at UCLA), instead of parents they have a controlling boss, and instead of a mean older brother they have something far much worse.  They don't create a woman from a barbie doll this time, they clone a real woman.  So, they have the original woman to deal with.
  The girl is updated too.  The guy and his friend mold the clone into the ulitmate man in a woman's body.  She loves drinking beer and watching sports.  The type of guys I mentioned at the beginning of this review would do anything to be dating a girl like this.
  However, for everyone else, the movie does have some nice moments.  Some of the actors give funny performances including Desmon Askew and (the always great) Eugene Levy.  Ali Landry does a very good job in both her roles (playing the real girl and the clone).  Also, the special effects for the scenes where the real girl meets her clone are fairly well done.
  Like I said, this movie is made for a certain type of man, but there are a few things in it that would appeal to other types of people.",1029024000,,1558,4.325259515570934

7964346,5,B000068ME6,"This movie is very under rated.  Ali landry performs a dual role and does a fantastic job. As other reviewers have noted, she gets the jokes.  That means she has the skill to use her facial and body movements the correct way.  Her expressions fit the situation.  Unlike some actresses that are just there...a bland stare or expressionless.  Landry knows how to be funny, sexy, cute, and more. Wow!  Please give her a role in a film, soon!",1098144000,7,438,4.551282051282051
7964347,5,B000068ME6,i noticed this at the video store one day and read the back. it sounded funny so i thought i'll give it a try. eugene levy was my main reason for renting it. i admit that. this is a very funny movie. i laughed very hard. a little overboard on the offensive humor but still a very good movie.  everyone should watch this. good boys night in movie.,1068336000,,346,4.088235294117647
7964348,5,B000068ME6,"Well, listen to this. I am 37 and I am a French guy living in France. I first saw this movie on sale today in a French supermarket. the theme of the movie caught my eyes but i thought this is probably a very bad movie. It just looks good but there is nothing behind it. I went to Amazon to check the critics and they were excellent but only 6 of them. The movie is practically unknown to the public. Then I decided ""let's go for it"" and I returned to buy it along with a pizza and a pack of beer. Let me tell you that there is no need to sip the beers to enjoy this movie. I have seen so many movies those last 20 years and You can trust me if I tell you that this is a great comedy! it doesn't even look in any way as a cheap movie. Just is a great one. I just don't understand why it didn't came out on the big screens!
I was afraid the actors would have a goofy and unbelievable way of acting as it is often the case in cheap comedies but they are believable and you can go buy it right away.",1065744000,9,995,3.7655502392344498
7964349,4,B000068ME6,"Everything about this movie is silly, from the premise/plot to some of the gags. Having said that though, I confess throughout most of the movie I laughed out loud. The actors did a fine job with comedic timing and thought some of the scripts laughs were juvenile it worked.
Two ""geeky"" buddies decide meet an incredibly attractive female journalist with boyfriend of course. During cloning experiments she is accentitaly cloned, and fearing all kinds of repercusions the buddies decide to keep the success of human cloning secret, yet feeling such a lady wouldn't have any more intrerest in them than the original they ""program"" the clone to think and act like a male in a hot female body and comedy ensues.
If you want high-brow sophisticated humour this probably isn't the movie for you. However if you want cheap laughs then I suggest you see this. There's even a few romantic scenes qualifying it as a ""date-movie"" HAHAHA.",1065312000,5,927,4.8734177215189876
7964350,5,B000068ME6,"I normally would withhold a 5 star rating for a classic like REAR WINDOW or BRAVEHEART... something of that calibur.  But, for what REPLIKATE is.... it deserves 5 stars.  And what it is, is a movie that didn't get a sliver of recognition, a sliver of publicity and holds more bust out laughs than any movie of recent that I can remember.
I gathered my brothers and sister around the other day and told them that they had to see this movie that nobody had heard about.  I had already watched it 4 times and was prepared to watch it again.  My sister was ready to go home, but instead we all gathered around and laughed our butts off.
Contemporary comedies are all trying to capture the laughs that movies like CADDYSHACK, AIRPLANE and BLAZING SADDLES received, but most of them fail because of one reason: they're afraid to offend anybody.  By the time movies hit the screen, the EXECS have cut out all the funny stuff in order to be politically correct and not hurt people's feelings.  Well, in a way, that's why REPLIKATE works so well.  Because nobody cared about it, and it went straight to video, THEY ACTUALLY LEFT THE FUNNY STUFF IN!
The movie is a cross between AMERICAN PIE, REAL GENIUS and WEIRD SCIENCE, and funnier then all three.  Lots of gender and sex jokes.  The best way to describe it is to say that it feels like a movie made by the writers of MAXIM or STUFF magazine.  Believe me, if you can find a copy of it, watch it, you won't be disappointed.
Also, and the most important point to make is that I never really had an opinion about Ali Landry before REPLIKATE, but after watching it, I think she's a hoot.  On the surface, this girl is BEAUTIFUL, but underneath, she's good.  Really good.  She had to have a lot of charm and charisma to pull this off and she was overflowing with it.  You'll fall in love with her... both of her.
It's unfortunate that a lot of people aren't going to see this gem of a comedy and miss the performance that she gives, but I think and hope that ALI LANDRY has a long career, and someday does something big.
By the end of the movie, you'll be saying ""I WANT ONE"".  HA HA",1041465600,18,2122,4.3232323232323235
