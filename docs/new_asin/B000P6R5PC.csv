8189207,4,B000P6R5PC,"I used Heaven - Beyond the Grave as a background tool for a Bible Study class I was teaching on Heaven. It provided good general info on different  ancient cultural perceptions related to life after death and how our ""modern"" ideas of heaven came to be. Our class took that information and used it as a jumping off point for discussions of other faith's beliefs in the after life, heaven, salvation, etc. If you are a seeker of any kind, looking for answers or solace - this video will not provide that for you. Like most History Channel presentations,they are beautifully made but they only skim the surface of the topic covered.",1464307200,,630,4.625

8189211,2,B000P6R5PC,"I start with the premise that I am experiencing a recent loss and have lost many people in my life over the years. When they label that this is from the 'History' Channel - they aren't kidding, almost Nothing about current experiences and anything other that pure relegious reinforcement - if you are already convinced and locked into your faith of the afterlife. Lots of babble about what releigious leader - name and so forth of who came up with which concept. A child who saw the otherside from a near-death experience is inspirational - they go a bit into the angle of terrorists and If they go to Heaven (too much time spent on them).
I also bought and watched the Barbara Walters Special (DVD) on Heaven - and it was less disappointing than this one. Still looking for something deeper and clearer - on a pure spiritual level.
Sincerely, Scott M.",1343260800,4,852,4.57516339869281

8189213,5,B000P6R5PC,"Anyone with a curiosity about what happens when you die, will thoroughly enjoy this History Channel special! This is one of the best they have ever presented.
In this video, the viewer will hear from both sides: those who believe that when you die, that ""it"" is over for good, then there are those who believe there is an afterlife. Thank goodness for Christian viewers, the makers of this video were able to find WAY more people who believe in God, Heaven and an afterlife! I found this video to be VERY reassuring.",1222732800,5,516,4.559139784946237
