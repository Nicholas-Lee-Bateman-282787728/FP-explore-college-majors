3762887,5,B001Q8FR80,"...about the evils done in the name of greater good. All God's Children uncovers and exposes the abuse of the most innocent by those who claim to be the most pious. I have seen the film several times, and it breaks my heart more each time I see it.",1253491200,,248,4.081632653061225
3762888,3,B001Q8FR80,"I am the child of a missionary family who spent almost ten of the twelve years of schooling at a boarding school.  I watched this video with much emotion!!!  The SADNESS for the lack of supervision of that school in Africa, the dormparents and teachers who were NOT called by God, but appointed by man, the children who could not tell their parents because of the deceit of those adults (and fear) installed, and the HURT to the children who were there!!!!  I am thankful that my experience was much different!!!!  It isn't that I didn't miss my parents ALOT, and that I had the attention a 'normal family' would have given, BUT I felt as if the teachers and dormparents really cared about us as individuals, and saw us as their responsibility to demonstrate God's love to as our parents would have!
I did not realize until I had my own children and began to raise them that my boarding school experience was NOT necessarily the best of 'God's Will'(or maybe even really God's will?)... BUT I also came to realize that man cannot make perfect decisions in an imperfect world, and I had to experience some of that (and felt the 'abandonment', hurts, etc.). I am a unique person of understanding OTHER's PAIN because of the pain I had.  My friends think that is a gift from God.  It could be??  That is why I felt the pain revealed in this DVD so deeply!!!!
I think I would like to tell those who made the video that they SHOULD receive more recognition and admittance for the GRIEF, etc. that they had to endure... BUT also that IF they never do they need to forgive and look FORWARD.  Some day all of those people will 'get their just reward' and the greatest Judge of all will judge them for what they did.  I learned that forgiveness is key to living life as God wanted us to live it!!!  There is always going to be someone or some thing to Forgive as long as we are breathing!!!!
I am more SAD for you than you can ever know... BUT I also pray that you can forgive all of those who inflicted such pain!!! (esp. those who deny they did anything wrong!! Oh my, they will get judged!)  May you find your peace with God and realized that HE ALSO FELT YOUR PAIN!!!!!!!!!  You are in my prayers!!!",1253404800,3,2194,4.363636363636363
3762889,5,B001Q8FR80,"A must see film. An informative and educational and excellent produced film for victims of child abuse, spirtual leaders and any one interested in protecting children. A must for religious and spiritual authorities for educating and understanding clergy abuse.",1250812800,,260,5.6923076923076925
3762890,5,B001Q8FR80,"It was a real pleasure to meet members of the family that made this film.  I saw the film at recent conference on sexual abuse by clergy.  I learned more about brain washing techniques and cults that dwell within organized religion.  I cried, of course.  For survivors (or anyone interested in stopping sexual abuse globally) it's a must!",1250640000,2,338,4.775862068965517
3762891,5,B001Q8FR80,"I had to buy this movie. I'm someone who is fascinated by religion's power over people. Whatever we think of this power, we can all agree that quite often this power is abused by the people who wield it. If you find this subject matter interesting, you'll want to see this. Especially in this time where many docs seem to strain to provide pure entertainment, it was refreshing to see a film that simply offers an unblinking look at its subject matter. It allows people to just tell their story - and when that story is something these people have kept inside for most of their lives - well, it's riveting just to hear them speak & oddly uplifting and cathartic to see these truths finally shared. All God's Children doesn't have heavy-handed voiceover narration, flashy graphics, etc...I found this refreshing. Instead, it takes actual film footage from the school that is the center of the story, and elegantly and quite hauntingly weaves these images throughout the film. What starts out as innocent-seeming images of children at play becomes increasingly disturbing simply by what you are learning as the film moves along. It's highly effective. I was glad to have watched this, I think you will be too.",1243987200,5,1207,4.8076923076923075
3762892,5,B001Q8FR80,"I had the privilege of viewing this film at the Sarasota Film Festival in 2008, and later was able to speak with some of the courageous victims of the abuses discussed in the documentary.  Their stories are disturbing but not uncommon.  What is truly remarkable about this film is that its depth is in its simplicity.  Rarely is a viewer taken to such a dark place through this type of footage.  A year later, I continue to be haunted by the images of lost innocence and the knowledge of the atrocities that can take place when authority goes unchecked.  As we watch history repeat itself all over the world, this film's relevance and message cannot be ignored.",1243036800,2,661,4.615384615384615
3762893,5,B001Q8FR80,"I own this DVD. It exposes the abuse that happens in the church and here specifically on the mission field. It shows the long term affect of abuse and the struggles to overcome these affects. Hopefully those who see this will work to stop abuse in our churches and on the mission field. I know these fact to be true and not exaggerated. I also went to Mamou and abuse was happening before the time shown in this film. A must see for church leaders.
We just had a screening of All GOD""S CHILDREN in our church. Go to the web site [...] to learn more then order the DVD and have your own screening.",1242864000,10,596,4.191304347826087
3762894,5,B001Q8FR80,I was privileged to attend a screening of this DVD and was very impressed with the production and the excellent information on this subject.,1242864000,6,140,4.875
8335160,4,B001Q8FR80,"This is a well put together documentary, which presents a subject which is relevant to missionary children who grew up in boarding schools, wherever they may have grown up.  It gives voice to survivors and describes their efforts to have their experiences recognized and validated.",1398643200,,281,5.2444444444444445
8335161,4,B001Q8FR80,"As a former MK I was very interested to find out about other peoples experience after being sent to ""Christian"" boarding schools. It was a relief to find out that so many others have experienced the trauma and abuse that I did but at the same time, it was disturbing for the same reason. How dare those people take advantage of young, lonely, and scared children who are so far away from home with no one to turn to. My parents were 3-4days away in Malawi when I went to Sakeji, NW corner of Zambia, and I would only see them 3times a year. Great DVD.",1372032000,,551,4.2075471698113205
8335162,5,B001Q8FR80,"I was involved in the process of seeing some of the people who ""took care"" of us brought to the semi-judicial meeting in Fort Meyers. I lived all the emotions expressed in the movie. Every parent contemplating sending their children to a boarding school needs to see this and weigh the costs, both to the children as well as to themselves, before being duped by mission boards. The point isn't in the choice itself--whether it's a bad choice or a good one. The key is to make it a thoroughly informed choice, and this movie thoroughly informs. The movie recalled to my mind the extremes that we experienced at Mamou--carefree children growing up in the jewel of the African continent, but burdened with a sorrow that is normally reserved for wartime loss of every description.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journeying-Mercies-Tuesday-Was-Gone/dp/B004GUSB56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journeying Mercies: Tuesday Was Gone</a>",1296864000,2,963,5.788732394366197
8335163,5,B001Q8FR80,"I am grateful for this movie. It is an important tool of God to continue to bring our Christian culture out of the denial that these things can happen. The film is captivating and articulate. It is not manipulative, or sentimental in the least, but instead gives a clear, factual, sensitive account of just one of many examples of Evil cloaking itself in the guise of Christian.

We, as believers, must recognize we are capable of the most vile of actions when we are not honest about our own fallibility. The heartbreak in this film is that the perpetrators do not take responsibility for their evil, and thus, the evil continues.

Thank you to the families highlighted in this film, who show heroic transparency in looking back as well as forward. You are my heroes. As a survivor of homeland mission abuse, I am thrilled that you took the risk to tell the truth and allow light onto a very dark subject. Your openness will be a gift to future generations, who will - I pray, recognize it CAN happen, then put in important safe-guards, so much pain may be averted.

This film is a must-see for leadership of every ministry, large or small. Let's open our eyes and deal with what is true.",1257465600,,1189,4.546728971962617
8335164,5,B001Q8FR80,"I saw this at a screening in New York attended by some of the victims from the film. Both the film and their Q&A afterwards were gut-wrenching and heartfelt but the film touches on issues greater than abuse at the hands of the Church and delves into core behavioral patterns across a much broader range of school systems (although that isn't recognized explicitly). The ugly, scarring, irresponsible and horrific physical and psychological abuse in this film is clear, but these are analog traits and children in other systems suffer similar damage to varying degrees. I hope that this doesn't end up being forgotten in the shadow of the extreme damage caused to the people brave enough to speak up in this documentary.

But at its heart this is a touching, well-made documentary about trust, about innocence, and about the systemic propagation both through ignorance and denial (and perhaps even through deliberate action) of pain, humiliation, abuse and the breach of that trust.

The most wonderful and promising aspect of this story is that the victims are coming to terms with their pain and abuse themselves. Their strength and composure and unity during the post-screening Q&A made this clear. This documentary is not a method of closure for them; they have been working out how to cope for years and will continue to. Instead, they see this as another weapon in their arsenal to try to break the cycle of abuse and in that regard this movie is priceless.

Well worth the purchase price.",1257379200,,1494,4.897233201581027
8335165,5,B001Q8FR80,"My mom is Marilyn Shellrude, my auntie is Beverly Shellrude. The things they endored at such a young age by the people that were suposed to teach them, educate them, help them is.... disturbing, sad, and just plain wrong on so many levels. And not only did my mom and auntie have to go thru all of that hell, but so did I. My mom couldn't be a mom all the time because she was depressed, having flash backs and panic attacks, and then flying all over the country trying to get the CMA to listen and do something about what happened. I hated and still do, Mamou and the people that hurt my family. The abuse never just ends at the victim, the people closest to them end up becoming victims as well. I wonder sometimes if I would have had more happy memories from when I was little, and not as many of me havin a tantrum because mommy had to leave again, or having to watch mommy cry or not talk to her cuz she was havin a very important phone call. But all I can do now is be there for my mom. I'm not a lil kid anymore, I'm 22 and I proudly support my mom and her courage, because her story and my aunties I know can, will, and does help other MKs or anyone really, that was abused by someone in the church or in a position of trust and authority over children. Victims are often ashamed and its hard for them to even first admit that it happened, so please spread the word and you never know, it could be you that helps save someone from their missory. Thanx : )",1256256000,2,1463,4.0657439446366785
8335166,5,B001Q8FR80,This video shows not only the abuse children of missionary parents but also what children of abuse encounter everyday.  I does demonstrate the struggles of healing that abused children go through when they become adults.  A must see for adults and especially by those who are adult children of abuse.  There is hope for healing.,1254009600,,328,4.927272727272728
8335167,5,B001Q8FR80,"This is a powerful film that remains levelheaded throughout.  It documents a dark series of events that continues to haunt those central to the film.  Yet as disturbing as the events in question can be, it's also uplifting to see these brave people begin to confront their demons, both internal and external.  All God's Children is an eye-opener on a number of levels.",1253836800,,368,4.809523809523809
8335168,5,B001Q8FR80,"Anyone who has suffered abuse as a child will identify with this film.  Anyone who has tried to understand what victims of abuse have to go through will benefit from watching this film.  Each child who attended Mamou Alliance Academy has personal, specific stories to tell.  As adults, we have reacted differently to those experiences.  But, woven together in All God's Children, our stories present a multi-faceted account of what happened, how what happened has affected us, and how we confronted those who were responsible.  The end result:  the truth is told.  I am honored to be a part of this documentary.",1253491200,2,611,4.931372549019608
8335169,5,B001Q8FR80,"All God's Children is an important documentary for all to see. Whether religious minded or not - it sheds a light on what can and is happening to our children around the world when we don't pay close enough attention. Even with the best intentions. The documentary is well executed, the interviews are heartbreaking and the message really needs to be spread.",1253491200,2,358,4.790322580645161
