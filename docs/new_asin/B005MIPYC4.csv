8479387,2,B005MIPYC4,"During a zombie outbreak, the stag party decide to play a game called ""Zomball"" where they pay to shoot zombies with a gun that gives off an electric discharge.  It is in a semi-controlled environment. Some humorous scenes, nothing to write home about. The scene on the cover never happens. Low budget. The funniest aspect was the previews where they advertise ""over 5 hours of film"" and ""16 new"" zombie films. Do the math on that one.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Lily Brown?)",1371600000,3,481,4.783132530120482
8479388,2,B005MIPYC4,"Cover art--------that is about it, beyond that I really did not care for this and hoped from the quirky cover and pre-info, we'd have another SOTD film.  Sadly not the case ---- they always say if you cannot say anything good then don't talk up -- okay then just this, save your money and for the Queen's sake - rent first.",1341273600,,323,4.295081967213115
8479389,3,B005MIPYC4,"The DVD cover shown on Amazon is a misleading one. To get straight to the point, there is little if any nudity in this production - the cover shown makes the movie look more like a carry on film!

Anyway, this is a reasonable zombie movie with a few funny twists. There are a couple of good performances and an interesting plot.

The story involves a typical stag party involving drinking, a stripper and a unique version of `paintball'. Enter the zombies as part of an innocent game. But things quickly go wrong.

I won't spoil the plot but you can imagine the chaos that results. There are some interesting areas such as talking zombies, thinking zombies and a nice subplot with the stripper and groom.

I enjoyed this obvious b-movie. You know what you are going to get. Don't go here for classic dialogue and Hollywood standards but it's still a solid British zombie flick, with a hint of Shaun of the Dead about and some excellent zombie make up...",1334707200,4,953,4.555555555555555
