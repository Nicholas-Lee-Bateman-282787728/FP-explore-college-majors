The story follows the beautiful daughter of a warlord and a concubine and her true love.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoy Kdrama period pieces.  It won't disappoint.

My disappoint isn't with the movie, but with the DVD.  The DVD came wrapped up as a new DVD, even though it was listed as used.  While I was watching the DVD, my computer detected  a corrupted sector on the DVD.  When I ejected the DVD, I noticed a visible mar.  I put the DVD back in my computer and jumped the corrupted sector.  I didn't miss much of the movie, so I watched it to the end.",1381622400,,680,4.275590551181103
8158255,5,B000KNA4QM,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The two main charactors are very good actors.  It starts out with lots of action. This movie has lots of twist and turns, can't help but to watch it till the end. I was surprised about how it ended. I really love that this movie has a romantic storyline to it. I've watched a lot of martial arts movies and this is my favorite. I had taped this movie onto a vhs tape off my dvr. I'm so glad that it is on dvd. I ordered this movie and it plays great. I'm going to order another just in case this one somehow disappears.",1300147200,,568,3.9391304347826086
