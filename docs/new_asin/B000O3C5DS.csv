2789588,5,B000O3C5DS,"This was a really interesting and somewhat disturbing movie. How do I put it? Anyone read Albert Camus' The Stranger (L'tranger)? You have that very impersonal guy, Meursault who is very disconnected with the rest of the world. Meursault navigates himself through a world personned by color, emotion, feeling, spirituality, life and so on, and yet he is totally not connected to any of it.

This movie seems sort of to be giving you a reverse situation. It is as if it asks - what happens to a person when he finds himself in a world populated by Meursaults? And that is just what happens. Andreas apparently winds up at a bus stop in a desert-like place and from there is taken to a very modern spic and span city. Here he is given perhaps everything that anyone could want in life - a job, friends, a girlfriend, nice apartment, etc. - What more could you ask for in life??? - Yet in spite of it all something is missing. The city, which he reached by way of the desert is itself a desert of sorts. The city (and its people) lacks color, emotion, feeling, etc. It is nothing but flesh, bone and nerve amidst concrete, gravel and steel. It is a hollow place. Andreas' sense that there something not right with the place increases as he finds the place to be more and more alienating. Ok - I'll stop here and not  say anymore about the story -

The movie seems to be some kind of existential commentary on modern societies, where on the surface, you seem to have everything, but deep within have nothing, and the lives lived are those of Thoreau's quiet desperation.

- Very good and intelligent movie.",1274227200,37,1602,4.476027397260274
2789589,4,B000O3C5DS,"I have just a couple of things to add to previous reviewers who have already covered this film quite adequately.

Point one is that, if you are the sort of person who likes mysterious films to eventually have clear explanations, perhaps you should look for a different movie.  Unlike a typical Twilight Zone episode, there is no narrator to explain what happened here in case you missed it, you will need to figure it out for yourself.

Point two is that I was surprised how bloody the film was, I guess I made an assumption given its lack of a rating.  I'm guessing this movie would be rated R, if it were rated, for two or three moderately gory parts and some (darkened) bedroom scenes.  Not for children or the squeamish.",1272758400,,724,4.4961832061068705
2789590,5,B000O3C5DS,"In a way the Scandanavian film industry has always been ahead of its time. While America was just coming out of its Hollywood shell, Sweden was enamoured over its gem in Ingmar Bergman--who was pondering man's relationship between himself, his self image, his society, and his god--and Norway's Nils Christensen's idea of a light comedy incorporated crazy mothers, ailing fathers, and unwanted love children. You could say that the regions been in an existential crisis for the past 50 years while these issues are still creeping into the American unconcious.

Enter The Bothersome Man. Andreas enters into a world without risk. He has job security, marital security, and physical security; but he sacrifices the enjoyment that this windfall should afford him. In a way it's the quintessential American movie: in order to get ahead in life you have to be willing to take risks. But it stays true to the Norwegian tradition of in depth character analysis; thoughtfully framed, long takes; and truthful thematic exploration. In a way, it's the perfect introduction to scandanavian cinema for the uninitiated.",1271289600,,1106,5.213483146067416
2789591,4,B000O3C5DS,"This is one movie I cannot seem to shake from my mind, not that I am trying to necessarily. It is compelling and provocative without a lot of bombast. Our main character Andreas commits suicide and finds himself in a bland, superficially comfortable world. Are his coworkers (who seem all to have anhedonia) really content with their ""nice"" lives, or are they sublimating real anxiety? What happens when he wants to delve deeper into this seemingly effortless existence and get to some real emotion, for instance? Andreas becomes quite bothersome. This movie gave me the creeps more than most alleged horror movies.",1266710400,,615,5.03921568627451

2789594,4,B000O3C5DS,"This Norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway, apparently commiting suicide. But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert. There he meets a man, and is shipped off to a mysterious city, where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant. The coworkers seem nice, if emotionless, and he soon meets a woman who becomes his girlfriend, yet the city seems utterly strange, as the food has no taste, alcohol doesn't make you drunk, and there's nary a children around. Is this a dream, or is he in paradise, or in hell?. While at times, the films looks as extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even at ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it is quite thought provoking. The best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal, as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration, and recoil at discussing deeper issues. I always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature. And this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style. Unfortunately, the movie is a bit too long, and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it, but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing.",1207872000,33,1286,4.644736842105263
2789595,4,B000O3C5DS,"This is not a film that grabbed my attention from the first frame but ultimately is a satisfying-puzzling-thought-provoking film.  The film is very visual with the choice of landscapes, urban development and interior decor carrying a significant role in moving the story-line forward.  The use of sound brings emphasis to the visual elements - especially the silence.

The plot is fascinating in that it works ... it is essentially a middle with neither beginning nor end.  That is to say that why/how Andreas, the protagonist, is delivered to the false utopian city is never known.  And at the end where Andreas leaps from a moving bus into the light, the result of that leap is never shown.  This leaves the viewer a very open interpretation possibility.  The bland superficiality of the city may be an indictment of comtemporary culture, of the failure of utopian dreams, of individuals satisfied with the appearance of pleasure rather than actual pleasure ...

The short film on the dvd is True Story by Stephanie J. Via.  The setting is well chosen, the script believable.  For my taste, however, the hammering home of the social message rather than trusting the strength of the art (film) is a serious flaw.",1207353600,2,1213,4.931034482758621
2789596,5,B000O3C5DS,"I don't know what point the creators were trying to make, but this movie is not for the narrow minded.  I spent as much time laughing at the poor schmuck's predicaments, Scandinavians have a wicked sense of humor, as I did trying to keep up with the goings on and the whereabouts.  I came to the ultimate conclusion that there may be no ultimate conclusion.  In our hero's existence nothing seems to follow a logic trail, although there is a predictability regarding the results of what he does, you can see some things coming, and his linear logic seems to go in a circle, ergo, he may  possibly be stuck in a cosmic revolving door.  The protagonist appears to be the architect of his own misfortune from the start and maybe that's the point; that we are the either the beneficiaries or the victims of our choices eternally.  Or, maybe, that immortality is different than being alive, and that eternal life with no prospect of relief by death is little more than a gilded cage devoid of the essences of what it is, or was, to be human.",1483228800,5,1036,4.48404255319149

I think it could be any of the above. The film remains quite opaque, and almost biblically short on details. It kept me both somewhat uncomfortable but also intrigued.

2789605,4,B000O3C5DS,"Spoiler alert.
So a man arrives on a bus, the only passenger. He is delivered to a city that lacks sensory stimulation beyond basic, as are the emotions of the people who live and work there. There are no children, only worker age and the elderly. He spies on another man who has discovered a crack in a wall through which he receives sensory stimulation. They work together to tunnel through to the light they can see from the small crack. The man succeeds in getting is arm through to that other side... What is on the other side is the normal lively world we all know. But he is dragged back into his bland world and taken to the same bus he had arrived in. Note that the man although run over by several commuter trains survives horrible injuries and is delivered back to his home that he shares with his girlfriend. Note also that in attempting to escape this bland world, the man had followed the bus that had delivered him to it but it disappeared after traveling a dirt road that leads to a field of rocky ground. After grabbing the man from the hole eventually they dump the man in the cargo compartment of the bus, it travels the dirt road to the rocky ground. The man kicks out the door to escape. When he does... Nothing is there. I think the man has died and gone to hell but does not realize it, as in this new bland world he does not die even though suffering horrible bodily injuries from the commuter trains. And there are no children as being innocents upon death they would go to heaven. The  problem is he has become 'bothersome' and cannot accept the fate he has created for himself so it is decided to put him back on the bus. When the bus stops after hitting the rocky ground, the man kicks open the door to escape...Unfortunately in the end there is nothing, no other place for him to go. Now this hell may be the result of his real life choices to work and accumulate stuff to exist rather than to really live life. Humans are beings but often choose to be just doers frittering away their lifetimes on that which does not in the end really matter. That is why at the end of the movie the man escapes to nothing. He did not live live in a way that really mattered.",1475193600,4,2189,4.274698795180723

2789624,5,B000O3C5DS,"I have a theory about this movie but if you read this comment, the movie will be spoiled for you.  In the first scene, Andreas kills himself by jumping onto a subway track right before the subway pulls into the station.  Smoosh, he's dead.  He's committed suicide.  Suicides go to hell -- a nice form of hell -- but hell nonetheless.  Hell is a place that is all shades of grey.  Nothing tastes good, booze doesn't get you drunk and people are all full of false bonhomie, as if afraid to express how they really feel.  People go to social gatherings and have girlfriends and boyfriends and wives and husbands but it's all so tedious and boring and blah, blah, blah.

Andreas complains in general to a man washing his hands in the men's room of a bar that as much booze as he's drunk, he's not drunk and the booze must be watered down or it isn't booze.  The man tells him it is booze but it won't make anyone drunk.  Someone pipes up from a stall in the bathroom and says, ""I miss hot chocolate.""  And continues to say something like, 'Here the hot chocolate tastes like nothing, here the pussy tastes like nothing....'

On a number of occasions, while walking past a particular building, Andreas hears beautiful music coming from a basement apartment.  This music is entirely out of character with this place he finds himself in.  He can't get into the building where the music is playing.  One day he snoops around and finds a way in and makes his way to the basement apartment.  He knocks on the door and recognizes the voice of the ""hot chocolate"" man who was in the bathroom of the nightclub the day after Andreas arrived in nice hell.

Andreas asked to be let in but the man refuses.  Andreas insists and eventually, he's let in.  He looks around the man's apartment, which is a converted basement space with block stone walls and a cement floor.  He notices a painting on the wall -- an object that is out of place in shades of grey nice hell.  Andreas asks the man where he got the painting.  The man points to a hole in the stone wall where light is shining through and from which the beautiful music is coming and says to Andreas, ""from that hole.""

Andreas and the kindred spirit, over the course of several days, excavate their way through the wall with the hole and eventually reach a place where there is another wall with a hole in it from which they can hear children laughing and music playing.  (There are no children in nice hell.)  Andreas gets excited and pushes his way through a final couple of feet of debris in front of the wall separating him from whatever the place is on the other side of the wall.  He manages to break through the wall and we see a quaint old-fashioned kitchen with a freshly baked cake on a table and voices of children and people talking with the sound of the ocean coming through an open door with bright sunlight streaming in.

The hole Andreas has opened up into this kitchen is very small and he can only get one arm through up to his shoulder...  He blindly gropes around, finds the cake and grabs a piece.  Suddenly, you see the grey-suited nice hell maintenance men pulling Andreas out of the hole back into the basement apartment.  Andreas is stuffing the cake into his mouth; it's obviously delicious and he's making yum yum yum noises.

The following day, Andreas arrives at work and finds that he's been replaced at his job. The grey-suited maintenance men arrive and take Andreas and the kindred spirit man to an administration building in the center of town.  The kindred spirit man is told that he may leave.  He scurries off.  Andreas is told to stay in the car.  A group of people Andreas has met since arriving in nice hell gather near the car Andreas is seated in.  One of the people in this group breaks away and walks to the car where Andreas is seated.  Andreas ignores her but the woman persists and keeps knocking on the window. She says to him that she cannot understand why Andreas has to be such a bother.  She says, ""What's wrong with you?  People ""love it here.""  She turns to the group for their opinion and they shake their heads 'yes,' in unison. 'What's not to like?"" she asks.  Andreas stares straight ahead and does not respond.

A car arrives -- it is the same man who picked up Andreas at the ""bus station"" and brought Andreas to town when Andreas arrived in nice hell.  This man (the nice hell greeter) and the grey-suited maintenance men drive Andreas back to the bus station.  They wait for the bus to arrive.  Andreas is hidden at the side of the station.  A lone elderly woman steps off the bus and the nice hell greeter keeps the woman occupied while the grey-suited maintenance men drag Andreas to the other side of the bus and unceremoniously dump him into a cargo hold and slam the door shut. The bus leaves and Andreas are in for a long, dirty, noisy and bumpy ride.  He eventually falls asleep.  When he awakens, it very quiet.  The bus has stopped.  Andreas uses his feet to push open the locked cargo bay door.  When he gets it open, there is a flash of bright light and the sound of gale force rushing wind and the ground appears to be drifting sand.  The cargo bay door slams down and the movie ends.

It appears that Andreas has arrived in not so nice hell.  There is no one there to greet him.",1454371200,,5294,4.403092783505155

2789665,3,B000O3C5DS,"Den Brysomme Mannen (The Bothersome Man) (Jens Lien, 2006)

Den Brysomme Mannen, released in English as The Bothersome Man, is a movie that, I confess, I started watching a few weeks ago and shut off in the middle. It gets a lot of good press among people I respect, so I was wondering if I was simply missing out on whatever it is that made them praise it so much. You see, the first half of this movie is boring. Immensely, mind-shatteringly boring. Lien obviously subscribes to the James Joyce method (a term I use in re: ""The Dead"", as in ""if you want to write a story about boring people, write a boring story""). And I can understand why he sets it up like this; he's trying to show that life in this nameless city where Andreas (Lilyhammer's Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself ends up driving him to make the decisions he makes in the much superior second half of the movie. But, my fillets of lutefisk, man, did you have to make it that boring?

Plot: Andreas, in the film's opening scene, is standing on a train platform. The only other people there are a scary-looking couple who are entirely engrossed in one another. He throws himself off...and then we cut to him riding a bus in the middle of nowhere. Has he committed suicide and is now on his way to the afterlife? Is this a flashback to ""how I got here""? We don't know. (While the specifics are eventually revealed, here's a SPOILER ALERT for you: even after Lien shows us the details, we're still not sure. It's one of the movie's moments of real brilliance.) In any case, Andreas is dropped off at a little filling station, where he's picked up by a very old car and taken to what, on the surface, seems like the perfect city--every inhabitant's needs are completely met, everyone has a job that seems perfect for him, etc. (If this sounds familiar, it should; writer Per Schreiner, turning in his first feature script, was obviously influenced by such classic conform-or-die scenarios as Camazotz and Metropolis.) But Andreas soon notices that with this contentment comes a discontent that, seemingly, only he is capable of noticing--everything is flat. Food has no taste, the atmosphere has no smell. He wonders if it's just him until a chance encounter in a restaurant men's room makes him realize that's not the case, and for the next few weeks he tries to battle the growing disenchantment he feels at knowing he's not the only one who notices this...

...at which point we get into spoiler territory. Which sucks, because that's the exact point when this movie starts getting very, very good. And I can't tell you why, because the pivotal decision Andreas makes exactly halfway through the film is, as far as this movie goes, the spoiler to end all spoilers. It's also the gateway to the movie's funniest scenes and the plot really taking off--it's here that the movie stops seeming like ""The Dead"" and heads into the territory of such wonderful dystopian worlds as Delicatessen, of which the second half of this movie put me in mind more than once for no reason I can quite put my finger on.

If the entire film had been as good as the second half is, I'd be calling it an instant classic and adding it pretty high up in my top 1000 movies of all time list. Unfortunately, however, you have to get through the first half to get to the second. ** ",1366329600,,3320,4.5544388609715245

2789670,5,B000O3C5DS,"I just saw the film yesterday and I will admit its disturbing and not light entertainment in some respects, so it should not be looked at as a casual film to be viewed over popcorn with friends on a sunny afternoon. This film attempts to make you think about the meaning of life, and if you don't question your own existence to some degree after seeing it, then you've problaby missed its dystopian ""point"" so to speak. So though I am rating it five stars, that's for philosophical promptings it creates, not strictly for entertainment value.

The final scene for me is the crux of the entire film, along with the scene where he almost escapes to the ""higher"" sensory realm so to speak - maybe the ""real"" world that he came from...

Ultimately, that is the whole question of the film. Not what is the point of the life they are all living in this gray existence, but the point of life period, regardless of how harsh or pleasant it may be.

It all seems to tie into the idea of simulated universes/realities and the idea of parallel worlds, an endless existence from one to another, which is ultimately far more disturbing than just being trapped in one existence alone for eternity. Where does it all end? Should it all end? Is there a way to go on eternally without at some point seeking death, regardless of how good your existence may be?

The homogenous Norwegian lifestyle is obviously a good backdrop for a film of this type, but we all have elements of this conformity and mundane existence regardless of where we live.

I found the ending was a way to placate the character, to give him the opposite of what he was first presented with, in order to bring him peace of mind. However, how I would have liked to see more of this new world they sent him to!!

But why not let him escape to the world of brilliant music as well? That's one of the major unanswered questions of the film. I think if I were in this character's shoes, not being a violent person, but in this case, I would have done anything to actually see that world of music - killed those trying to pull me away from it, knocked down the tunnel behind me, anything. What else is existence for, but to strive for this sort of paradise, and if it proves not to be a paradise, for something better still?

All the old people in the building, what were they waiting for? If you don't die, but grow old...would they at some point try to reopen the crack in the wall?

All in all, very thought provoking in a dystopian, depressing way. What is hell, what is heaven? Can we decide this for ourselves?

Seeing him pick himself up after repeated subway accidents, his girlfriend not even flinch at his appearance... I think it was Eli Weisel, the Holocaust survivor, who said the opposite of good is not evil, the opposite of good is indifference. This was an indifferent world that made a man who still had passion feel he were better off dead. Yet he got there from our world.

The next scene shows him being dropped off in the boonies.  He is taken to a town in which there is no young people.  No music.  No emotion.  A very antiseptic society.

Bizarre is a word for this film.  I just wish I could have seen the meanings in the movie.  There are so many little things in the film, like the men in the gray coats that drive the little gray car that always pick up the deceased or injured in the society.

2789682,5,B000O3C5DS,"This darkly satiric film is certainly open to more than one interpretation, from the social to the metaphysical ... and all of them would be applicable, I think. But for me, it especially works as a commentary on the superficial slickness of modern society, where everyone gets along by sticking to the surface, playing their roles as expected & being so very nice & civil. But not really civilized, I fear, because the passion & depth that define true civilization are both completely missing in this clean, neat city, which looks as if it sprang to (pseudo)life right out of the ads in a luxury magazine. It all looks wonderful at first ... but the food has no flavor, the settings have no color, and even the sex is mechanical & unsatisfying.

While most of the city's citizens -- or consuming units, really -- seem perfectly happy with this situation, newcomer Andreas doesn't quite fit in, no matter how much he tries at first. And when he becomes aware of a crack in a basement wall, where he can smell freshly baked bread & hear lovely music & glimpse golden sunlight ... well, that's it for him. He's desperate to escape his sterile surroundings for something genuine & authentic. But will that be allowed by the rest of the city?

I won't spoil what happens next. Suffice it to say that Kafka, among others, would recognize this territory, which is the glossy & empty facade of the consumer life, where all is surface & there's no substance. Yet so many people are vaguely content with this pale approximation of an inwardly rich & real life -- and those who can't accept the sugary lie are often ostracized for it. After all, if you've sold your soul for a hollow fantasy, who wants a bothersome man around to remind you of it?

He adapts to the unusual environment where all seems ok, no problems, everyone is happy.  Norwegian director has given the viewer an amazing visual of the surroundings.  Immediately, the viewer senses that something is different here, complete sterility, no color, no children, no smells, no problems.

Next thing you know he's on a bus to a way station where he's escorted to a new apartment and a waiting job. Everything is at an easy pace. Money is no problem, work load is light, his apartment is nice if but a bit austere and everyone he meets is pleasant.

But that seems to be the problem with everything. There are no highs or lows. There are no children around and everyone he sees or works with is about his age. No one is too fat or too skinny. No one is too tall or too short. All the colors are muted and all the furniture is minimalist. The food is bland and he can drink liquor till the cows come home and he isn't going to get drunk. Even the act of sex seems to be bland and unfulfilling.

That they are a totally even-keeled society that has lost all sense of adventure and passion. The opening scene shows Andreas in an underground train station. The only other people there are a youngish couple doing some heavy mouth to mouth. But their eyes are open and there seems to be no real passion. Just a going through the motions sort of thing. That's when he does himself in.

The concept is so good I wouldn't be surprised if the script wrote itself. This is a very well realized movie. The set, costumes, color schemes must have been easy to put together. It's shot well, acted well and has a very good musical score. If there is a reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it makes so much sense so quickly. You pretty much get what is going on early in the movie, so each new scene does little more than underscore what you already know. The reason you keep watching is to see how things will resolve themselves. I'm very curious as to how viewers will read the final scene.

Being a foreign, subtitled film, it certainly won't be for everyone. But for any viewer predisposed toward this sort of thing it's well worth the time to view it.",1287360000,11,2293,4.226027397260274

amazing how such a low budget movie (no stars, no expensive sets or hundreds of car chases) can keep you on the edge of the seat.  We found it fascinating.

-- hes dead. But a different customer review was terrific: that its a social commentary on the monotony of Norwegian life: everything is uniform/drab and no one can escape it. It works as both. I'd picked up on the element that he couldn't kill himself because he's dead; he doesn't stay physically hurt because he's dead; things simply resume as they do (with women, daily existence) because that's how it was set up for him - classic after-life genre stuff. I love that genre.

8182711,5,B000O3C5DS,"Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvag) has stepped off a bus, transported alone to this stark strange place. He knows no one, but everyone seems to know him. He's been ostensibly set up with all worldly needs: attractive home, job, girlfriend, a retinue of folks to socialize with. Everything is stunning and pristine. But something's definitely amiss, and it has to do with emotion and sensory experience. You will see. This clever film requires the viewer to suspend a good bit of reason, in favor of an experiential journey, in which the pursuit of precedent, logic and analysis don't overwhelm.  They'll be waiting for you at the end. This is a very smart, polished, captivating film. There's a bit of gore, but it's consistent with the storyline. Those bits might qualify for the darkest of humor, but they're not pervasive. The imagery, artistic compositions, in fact, most of the camerawork is brilliant. The music selections are exceedingly well-chosen and relevant.  Writing, directing, editing, acting, all filmmaking disciplines are firing just right.
