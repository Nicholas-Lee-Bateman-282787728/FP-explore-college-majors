I loved it when I saw it in the theater but have been disappointed ever since by the poor picture quality of its TV broadcast and VHS tape presentations.  I had high hopes for the DVD, but as  other reviewers have commented, it is mediocre.  Still, it is the best that  is available and if you are a true fan of The Rocketeer, then you will want  to have it.  It is a  shame that Disney has so little respect for movie  fans that they released a bare-bones disk like this that doesn't do the  movie justice.",937094400,,538,4.038095238095238
453409,3,6302269431,"I remember this film in the theater being really crisp and sharp, an excellent experience.  Unfortunately this transfer is jaggy and according to a clip below from my favorite DVD review site, DVDfile.com, it isn't in  the original aspect ratio.  I feel people should be aware of things like  this to push more studios to do a decent job with their releases rather  than the cheapest possible product.
Snippet from dvdfile.com  review
""I'd been looking forward to this release for quite some  time. As Buena Vista Home Video stubbornly resisted new transfers for  back-catalog titles and 16x9 enhanced video in general, my hopes for a  superior DVD slowly evaporated. My low expectations were predictably  fulfilled. This appears to be a recycled transfer, a letterboxed D2  presentation that has an odd aspect ratio. The film is rated at 2.35:1 but  appears to be closer to 2.0:1 - I was too disappointed in the transfer to  bother measuring it. The video suffers from all the usual composite  symptoms, compounded by the jaggies of conventional 4:3 letterboxing. The  color balance, blacks, and noise levels are mediocre. Visible digital  artifacts and visible edge enhancement are minimal.""",935452800,,1193,5.135416666666667

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE ROCKETEER [1991] film debuted in the cinema to great excitement and here the Walt Disney Studios pays homage to a film that celebrates B-movie serial films that you would view at the Saturday Morning Pictures that were so popular in those days and is a visually impressive restoration. The Disney's THE ROCKETEER is based on the comic book by Dave Stevens and has now been released on this Blu-ray to celebrate its 20-year anniversary.

The story takes place in 1938 Hollywood and centres on Cliff Secord [Billy Campbell], a young man who loves to fly planes. But his dreams suddenly take a sharp turn when the airplane he has spent most of his life building ends up broken into pieces on the runway after a shootout between the FBI and a couple of mob members. All appears to be lost until he discovers a small rocket engine hidden in one of the older planes where the mob stashed it for safe keeping. With the help of his mechanic, Peevy [Alan Arkin], Cliff Secord manages to wear the engine and becomes The Rocketeer.

A gang of crooks has stolen a top-secret rocket backpack from Howard Hughes. Pursued by the FBI, they ditch it in Cliff Secord's hanger, where he finds it. After a few experiments to see how it works, he straps it on and becomes The Rocketeer that the newspapers call him and is born. But, while Cliff Secord's intentions are to use the pack only for honourable purposes and return it to the legitimate owner upon request, others want it for darker reasons, and they're willing to do almost anything to get it. Soon, Cliff finds himself pursued by gangsters, Nazis, and a big, ugly man with a rubber mask.

THE ROCKETEER film cheerfully tries to roll back the years by about a half-century and has all the ingredients that were once so popular in films of this genre, as per example: a hero with a good heart, a sexpot girlfriend with ample cleavage and a stunning smile, a dastardly villain with thoughts of world domination, and lots and lots of action. Director Joe Johnston, whose previous films include Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Jumanji, but consciously goes for the retro feel and for the most part it is totally successful.

THE ROCKETEER contains a fair number of special effects, most of which are the original ""old-fashioned"" way as opposed to CGI computer generated images that are produced today. When the film came out, and pioneering CGI computer generated effects were beginning to make their presence. The flying sequences are surprisingly believable, and the climactic sequence on the airship dirigible is by far a very impressive effects and of course nostalgia certainly plays a big role in THE ROCKETEER films success. But on the other hand in THE ROCKETEER it looks back nostalgia on Hollywood through the proverbial rose-tinted glasses, and showing us what we want to see and believe.

In the end, however, THE ROCKETEER film was not a big box office smash hit that the Walt Disney Studios was hoping for, but because on its release in the cinema people thought it had a slightly old-fashioned outlook and approach genre. THE ROCKETEER film has aged more gracefully than the Batman film. The image techniques used with this film gives a very vibrant and rich look to it. You would be hard pressed to find many films of todays standard that look as good as THE ROCKETEER does on this brilliant Blu-ray disc. If you did not know this was made 20 years ago, you would swear it was a brand new film. THE ROCKETEER may be to some people not to be that perfect, but it's an excellent example of how to adapt a comic book hero to the big screen presentation and to me I love this film and have a great fondness for it and especially the effort the director Joe Johnston has put his heart and soul into the film.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment once again brings us a top quality 1080p digital restoration that is very impressive and of course is helped along the way with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The blacks and contrast are solid, and the colours are accurate overall. There is some slight noise at times, but this was likely present in the original print of the film. The stunt scenes look especially great in high-definition and the wonderful edge detail in all those green screen shots makes the 1990s special effects really stick out. The encode image is fairly pristine and there is no compression or ghosting noted. And the print is clean, save for a speck of dust every now and then. The image does flicker from time to time, and cinematography does favour a soft visual design, but neither is too distracting. This film looks pretty remarkable in HD. In film terms, twenty years isn't all that old, but for a twenty year film, this does look wonderful.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment presents us with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience that sounds spectacular! The original score composed by James Horner sounds beautiful, and utilizes mostly the front left and right channels with some organic uses of the rear surround and subwoofer (LFE). However, the audio really flexes its muscle with the flight scenes, when the planes swoop and dive dynamically from speaker to speaker. Overall, the audio sound experience is crisp and perfectly balanced. There is plenty of action to give your audio system a very good workout, and supplementary channels are more restrained during more dramatic and dialogue-laden sequences. The audio track does provide an organic, impressive listening experience, especially considering the film is 20 years old now.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1991] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:19] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE ROCKETEER. What a shame this could not have been shown in the proper Panavision 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

Finally, for those new to THE ROCKETEER, the film was based on a comic series of the same name. In the film, Cliff Secord [Bill Campbell], a young down-on-his-luck pilot with dreams of making a name for himself, and getting the girl of his dreams girlfriend Jenny Blake [Jennifer Connelly]. When Cliff Secord and his old friend Peevy [Alan Arkin] stumble upon a mysterious self-manned rocket pack, and soon realises this could be his ticket. THE ROCKETEER is a great piece of old school vintage cinema that has aged quite well over the years. Director Joe Johnston, his cast and his crew nail the film's 1930's authentic aesthetic and tone. And the narrative keeps you on your toes, especially as it is one of the best early comic-book adaptions of its time. THE ROCKETEER is a fun combination of Indiana Jones derring-do, Iron Man aerial acrobatics, and a Flash Gordon-esque hero. The film might have flopped when it first got released, but THE ROCKETEER remains a beloved cult classic film gem, that is a film rightfully deserves. I really wish they had made some sequels to this since it would have been great to continue this series. Please note Disney: it is not too late! Highly Recommended!

It is the 1930's. Pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) and his mechanic partner Peevy (Alan Arkin) want to fly in the nationals.

Though I doubt I'd wanna clutter up my house owning this on DVD. I also found myself wondering why Disney would put its name on a movie as violent as this one, since it is a bit over the top for young children to watch. It would have been more fitting using the Disney alias ""Touchstone"", which is the name they use for their more adult-themed products.

In looking back on this, I find it interesting that it was directed by Joe Johnston, who did the first Captain America movie, which included some similar elements, Nazis and World War II stuff.  The Rocketeer tells the story of a stunt flier who inadvertently comes into possession of a rocket pack that is being sought by Nazi agents working inside America.  It is incumbent on the flier, played by Bill Campbell, to keep it from the Nazis, as we get to see a really well done newsreel that clearly demonstrated the Nazi's intentions for the rocket pack.  Great finish on top of a Nazi Zeppelin.  Timothy Dalton steals the show as a Nazi agent whose cover is as a well known and flamboyant Hollywood actor.",1484438400,,765,4.595588235294118

To us jet pack are something you can get away with in animation but not live action.  The film really is just a piece a crap and is definitely not underrated.

453947,4,6302269431,"I know Ive seen The Rocketeer at least a couple of times, but its probably been at least a decade since I watched it (if not much longer).  After picking up Hallmarks ornament based on the movie this year, I got really curious to see it again, so I borrowed the movie from the library.  Im glad I did because I enjoyed it.

The story is set in 1930s Hollywood and revolves around Cliff (Bill Campbell).  Hes a pilot whose dreams of competing in an upcoming flying competition are shot down, literally, when he accidentally flies his plane over a car chase.  What he doesnt know is that the car chase involves a self-contained jet pack designed by Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn).

When the chase comes to his hanger, Cliff finds himself in possession of the jet pack.  Instead of turning it over to the authorities or finding the owner, Cliff and his friend Peevy (Alan Arkin) make a few modifications to it, and Cliff puts it to use.  What he doesnt know is that the Nazis, lead by film leading man Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) will stop at nothing to get their hands on this rocket.  And Cliffs girlfriend Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) just happens to be working on his latest movie.

In many ways, this is a typical superhero origin story.  We meet Cliff and his friends and see how he acquires his powers, in this case the rocket pack.  However, it doesnt feel like one  possibly because the villain is not developed in quite the same way the villains in todays movies are.  First of all, hes human.  Secondly, we spend just enough time with him to know his motivation and plans, but thats it.  Instead, the movie focuses on Cliff.

And this movie is fun.  With that 1930s feel, it actually captures a bit of what life was like for the well connected in Hollywood of the era.  The production did a perfect job of making you feel like you were back in that era between the sets and props and costumes.  Plus there are so many perfect little moments where I couldn't help but smile.

Of course, I do have to point out the one thing that still turns me off - Lothar, who is a big brute who looks remarkably like Frankenstein's monster (although no one else makes the connection).  Hes downright scary, and he kills a couple of people rather brutally.  Im not saying its anything bloody or graphic, but what we do see still turned my stomach a little. (And yes, I know Im the guy who reads all those murder mysteries.)  I think more than anything its that these deaths seem out of character with the fun that is the rest of the film.

On the other hand, I loved Jenny.  While yes, she does provide plot complications for Cliff and she ultimately does need saving, shes not a typical damsel in distress and does her best to fight back, even helping Cliff at one point.  Plus, she gets my favorite line in the movie (no, not the one used in the title).

The acting is wonderful.  Its obvious the cast is having fun making this film and it comes through in the performances.  It may not be award worthy, but it fits the film.

Sadly, the special effects don't hold up as well today.  You can tell that the flying scenes, especially the ones outside, are fake.  But what do you expect for a movie that first came out in 1991?  Considering the time period, it actually looks pretty good.

The box office wasn't great for The Rocketeer, and its fallen into cult classic status.  If you are one of those who hasn't seen it yet, I recommend you find a copy and fix that today.",1434672000,,3467,4.404724409448819

454008,4,6302269431,"When Cliff Secord stumbles upon a rocket pack stashed away in an airplane, him and his friend Peevy soon find themselves on the run from gangsters with ties to the Nazis.

I saw this back when I was a kid and its still one of my favorite superhero flicks, namely because its historical, has a very human superhero, and is about flying. I mean, who doesnt want to fly? Better, who doesnt want to think they can somehow piece together a rocket pack, strap it on and take to the sky?

What makes this superhero movie different is its not about a guy going around and helping people while trying to juggle a secret identity and, later, ultimately facing off against a supervillain. Instead, its about someone who has something the bad guys want and spends all his time running from them, occasionally helping people along the way. So while true the standard superhero ingredients are there, they're presented outside of the standard formula thus setting this flick apart. Couple that with it taking place in the past during a simpler timea classier time, tooand youve got a memorable movie.

I like how they also blended real life history into this, namely bringing in Howard Hughes as the designer of the rocket pack. Very cool. Throw in a Nazi as a main villain and youve got some solid Good vs Evil going on. Speaking of which, Timothy Dalton as Neville Sinclair the Nazi was awesome. He was super evil in this and once you found out who he really was you just hated the guy. You gotta love villains you can hate and feel justified in doing so.

There was certainly a pulpy feel to this movie, which is good, as the Rocketeer is an old time hero, a pulp hero, in fact. They kept that element alive, even so far as having him go up against a giant goon with a unique visage. Reminded me of the Dick Tracy villains. Sweet.

If you dig pulp heroes, The Rocketeer is definitely recommended viewing. Go see for yourself.",1426032000,,1914,4.504322766570605

454028,3,6302269431,"Alarmingly over-budgeted (and overly marketed) film is essentially a stillborn tribute to the 1930s movie serial (this movie began life in 1982 and did not come out until 1991) and as such it is a hit and miss affair indeed. I have particularly fond memories of it from younger days, but analyzing the film now produces much more uncomfortable results for me. Cliff Secord is a stunt pilot with a beautiful girlfriend (the vivacious Jennifer Connelly, who was young and luscious here) and a helpful but wisecracking mechanic friend named Peevy, and they both become embroiled in a plot involving a secret Nazi agent, a bunch of gangsters, the F.B.I., Hollywood, and even Howard Hughes, all leading up to a sensational (but somewhat unspectacular) sequence aboard a zeppelin. To give anyway anymore about the plot would be utterly superfluous.
Disney apparently believed that they had another ""Indiana Jones"" style hit upon their hands with this one (but like 1994's ""The Shadow"" and 1996's ""The Phantom"", the bomb was in the hatch from the point of conception), but the film is too clearly homogenized in the hopes of appealing to a kid-friendly market, and I usually would not complain about that aspect alone. However, in the case of ""The Rocketeer"", there is simply the case of too much studio tinkering, too many watered down dramatics, and not enough emphasis upon the visual excitement offered in the original Dave Stevens comic series (Bettie Page fans know what I'm referring to). In point of fact, ""The Rocketeer"" is an oddly slow-moving film, not uninteresting but awfully calculating, with not enough action or enough big thrills to keep the Indiana Jones crowd (let's face it, children essentially, be they young or old) on their toes. However, in time, the film may be more appreciated for its lavish production design, and really, as something to simply look at and admire, the film is successful in many ways. Perhaps if it had not been marketed as an action film it would have done better than it did upon its initial release, but again, in time, it may prove to be an enjoyable entertainment for the performances alone: Terry O'Quinn is great as Howard Hughes, Timothy Dalton is really on with his Errol Flynn-type role, and Tiny Ron Taylor (doing something of an impression of Rondo Hatton's character from pictures such as Universal's ""House of Horrors"" from 1946) really do help to keep the film in conversation with movies of the past, and I admire it for attempting to have a dialogue with old movie serials and utilizing the references to the stories of these golden (or silver, you fill in your own element) age movie stars. But the travesty of all this is that the film might have been more substantial had the trio of Stevens/De Meo/Bilson been able to get some funding to produce the film as a low-budget, black and white experiment as they had initially intended to--it too may not have been great, but I think it would have been interesting. Still, despite Disney's disappointment at having to drop the much hoped-for sequels (that were due to follow this class act), ""The Rocketeer"" is enjoyable in many ways BECAUSE it is a lightweight, friendly affair, and missing all of the sexiness, violence, and color of the original Dave Stevens stories and art. But the film still shows signs of having had too many scripts tampered with and changed, and too much interference by those who were looking to sell toys rather than to make (and then sell) a real film. As a critic, I have to note that I feel that the real reason the movie doesn't work as well is because it lacks a real narrative drive, and again there is so little action or suspense pushing it along. It seems at times as if the filmmakers were working from a concept without having any really definite sense of story, and that they were both too cautious (keep it for family viewing, now) and too presumptuous (hey, if they liked Jones, they'll like Secord, even if his name sounds like a pediatrician's prescription for a sinus case) to really be allowed to come off with any sense of genuine creativity. It could also be that the Stevens-created character was ideal for the comics page format, but a bit too shallow for a feature film made by a major company. Nonetheless, there are the performances, and if you like 90's comic book movies (this makes a great feature to watch alongside of ""The Shadow"" and ""The Phantom"") then you may end up cherishing it for its classy look alone. But, for me personally, it's a bit too much market and not enough film (and this is one movie that I wish Harlan Ellison would have reviewed). (Yet I also have to say that I did enjoy Campbell's performance as Cliff.) I have only yet seen the old VHS tape release in full screen, so that is the version I am writing about...I have high hopes for the new Blu-Ray release but have not as of yet upgraded. Oh, and if the rumor is true that James Wan is going to be the director of the alleged remake of this title, I simply have to scratch my head in confusion--really, what more can anyone do?

454087,3,6302269431,"Having seen bits and pieces of ""The Rocketeer"", and not having been impressed, the opportunity to get a copy at a low price encouraged its purchase. Unfortunately, the film as a whole turns out to be a huge snooze.

The principal problem (as I discuss in my recent review of ""Oz The Great & Powerful""), is that the nominal protagonist is put in a reactive situation. He has to save his girlfriend from the evil Nazis -- and that's about it. He's given no strong ""I want"" desires of his own to drive the story. And, as it usually does, this makes for not-very-engaging storytelling.

It doesn't help that the script grinds through all the expected events and turns mechanically, with no real twists or surprises; that the title character is played by Bill Campbell, an actor devoid of any appeal other than good looks (Bruce Campbell would have been a better choice); and worst of all, that Joe Johnston, the Baron of Boring, is at the helm.

You'd think a superhero film set in pre-WWII Hollywood would be a hoot, but Johnston plods his typical colorless path through the story. Johnston was thrown out of film school because he ""broke too many rules"". Apparently these included the most important one of all -- ""Don't be boring."" Yes, he had a mediocre script to work with, but directors have been known to rewrite on the fly (ahem). And most-unforgiveable of all, he lets the film end with everyone //just standing around//!

Hey, Joe, how about this... Howard Hughes shoves the suit at Cliff and says ""I want to see you fly this thing. Give me some tips so I'll know what to do when //I// take it up."" Cliff takes off, and the film doesn't end with a loud and embarrassing THUD!",1415491200,,1681,4.556291390728477

This is where I grew to know and love Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Commander Cody, and a slew of noir films. The Rocketeer does a wonderful job of touching that world while still having the ability to engage a generation that has never heard the word 'noir' or 'art deco'.

I've enjoyed this movie with my wife - a fellow silver screen fan - as well as a roomful of thoroughly modern 21st century school kids. Campbell, Dalton, Arkin, and Connelly turn in solid performance. Jennifer Connelly shines in the movie, demonstrating a poise and elegance that indicates to me that she was born out of time.

And kudos to Timothy Dalton for playing a wonderfully villainous Errol-Flynn-gone-bad character with all the usual Dalton energy and charm. The real Errol Flynn was never a Nazi in any way, a totally loyal member of the British Empire, just to get that out of the way--the deliberate resemblance to the real Errol Flynn here is purely fiction.

This is the story of how Cliff, a pilot, because the hero known as the Rocketeer. The film starts off with Cliff test flying a new plane that he is going to enter in a national race. Do to no fault of his own the plane crash lands and is lost beyond repair destroying the fuel truck of the local business man. In order to pay for this debt Cliff agrees to fly another plane in the air show that this business runs. When Cliff inspects this plane he finds a rocket pack in one of its seats. With the help of his friend Peevy (Alan Arkin) he learns to use this rocket pack to save someones life. Meanwhile two different fractions are searching for this rocket pack. One group is the FBI and the other group is a bunch of mobsters that were hired by Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton), a Hollywood actor.

Character Development

Cliff (Bill Campbell) learns what it takes to become a hero, but he doesnt have to do any soul searching to do it. He doesnt have to sacrifice anything or face any real trials and in the end he is pretty much the same guy he was at the start of the film. Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) does make a more noticeable change. She had stardust in her eyes at the beginning of the story, but by its conclusion she had a different perspective on Hollywood.

Acting

The acting was really brilliant in this film. All the players reach high marks all the way down to the bottom of the cast. I particularly enjoyed Bob Leemans role of W.C. Fields. The acting is on the pinnacle of any current comic book hero movie that you may choose to see, with all the black and white bad guys and heroics and colorful characters you can ask for. There are mobsters with hearts of gold, greedy nickel nursing business men, historical figures, intrepid FBI agents, and a bunch of cartoon Nazis to shot at. This is art mirroring art; Hollywoods looking back onto itself circa 1940.

Overview

This picture could have been made into a sequel. It had all the right ingredients and there was even a seed at the end that hinted that this could be a possibility. Yet I believe the talk was that this picture went over budget and the studio didn't get a good return on their investment so a sequel wasn't in the cards. Still there should have been one. This was movie magic. It had the feel of no other comic book hero movie. Like Batman the Rocketeer didn't have any super natural powers. He could fly, but only because he was wearing a rocket pack, only this was not like any recent Batman film. There was a certain ease and finesse here that didn't go overboard in the telling of it. I don't think the creators of the Rocketeer would have Batman speaking almost unintelligible or have him destroying squad cars and rooftops.",1406419200,,2722,4.399602385685885

The period setting in the golden age of Hollywood and a pre-war America has all of the innocence and wholesomeness you would expect from that era. The excitement of then-new technology leading to a high-tech future is hinted at, but is slowed down by the plot like a sprinter wading through melting tar.

Cliff Secord is a stunt pilot (played by the charisma-free Bill Campbell, who I have never heard of) who discovers a prototype jet pack designed and disowned by Howard Hughes himself. Cliff, and his friend Peabody (a much more likable Alan Arkin) experiment with the jet pack, but never make any solid plans for it. The movie loses altitude here. Instead of soaring into the stratosphere by giving a thrill ride into this new invention the movie too often deviates into a sub-plot with Jennifer Connolly as the girlfriend and Timothy Dalton as the villain, and the best thing about it.

What the Rocketeer should have done is establish the new-found jetpack within the first 10 minutes, given us about 20 minutes of the origins of Secord as a new superhero, and then spent the remaining 80 minutes fighting villains. It is so frustrating that every time the movie should finally take-off it cuts away to a story that drags it to a halt.

The production design and special effects are all top-notch. The pre-CGI sequences of the Rocketeer jetting around the sky don't look bad despite coming in at the tail end of the optical effects era. The anamorphic Panavision photography is extremely high-key, and this perhaps is a fault. If the film were a little more rough around the edges it might have worked in its favor. James Horner's twee, sweet-natured, treacle score was a misjudgment though. Silvestri or Goldsmith could have improved on it, but I guess that they were far too busy in 1991.

Despite its shortcomings it is a shame that the Rocketeer did not end up being as popular as the Mummy or Zorro series. Although Bill Campbell really does look like Brendan Fraser, who was also in Looney Tunes: Back in Action, which featured Timothy Dalton as a spy pretending to be an actor - exactly what he is in this movie. Weird.

It's easy to see why it has gone on to be a cult favorite, and it is still worth checking out.

The Blu-ray looks great in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. Sadly, the only extra is a trailer. I don't think Disney is fond of this film.",1380499200,2,2874,5.223427331887201
454374,4,6302269431,"...except that it takes place entirely in Southern California. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it does distinguish it from the globe-trotting approach of those other films.

""The Rocketeer"" (1991) takes place in 1938 where a pilot (Billy Campbell) and his mechanic find a jet-pack that can enable humans to fly. The problem is, the Nazis, the FBI and the Mob all want it and are willing to kill for it. Jennifer Connelly plays the pilot's girlfriend and Timothy Dalton his rival.

It's surprising that Campbell didn't go on to greater success after this movie, but I guess the fact that the film performed modestly at the box office had something to do with this. Jennifer is in her prime here and never looked better (she unfortunately lost weight and her beautiful curves in subsequent years). Dalton almost steals the show as the dastardly villain.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Rocketeer"" is just a fun, rollicking adventure film in the tradition of Indiana Jones and The Mummy. If you're in the mood for this type of fare it delivers the goods and delivers them well. That said, it's not great. Some aspects are too tame; for instance, they could have done more with Connelly.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, Hollywood, Santa Maria and Piru, California.

I looked forward to receiving it; after so long, I was excited to see it in HD, and Disney just had to have some neat extras up its sleeve for the re-release after having nothing of note on the DVD, right?  Right?

Sadly, no.  How does anyone, let alone Disney, release a '20th Anniversary Edition' blu-ray, a re-release of such a beloved film, without a single compelling special feature?!  Disney, you really dropped the ball on this.  Calling it an anniversary edition release, without doing anything to commemorate it, was a mistake.  You at least could've included video of the 'reunion' Q&A at the El Capitan.  (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rocketeer-20th-anniversary-reunion-a-205040)  This would be a five-star review, but for that fact.

Fortunately, the movie itself still holds up well, and the remastering was very well done.  Seeing it in HD is a treat, and the audio track is as epic as ever.

Director Joe Johnson perfectly captures the look and feel of Hollywood (or what Hollywood should look and feel like) during the 1930s. Great casting with Bill Campbell right on target at Cliff Secord, Jennifer Connelly as his best girl, Jenny Blake (originally named Battie in the book), Alan Arkin as Cliff's mentor and plane mechanic friend, and Timothy Dalton as the Erroll Flynn inspired Nazi spy-movie star Neville Sinclair. Like The Phantom, it is a homage to the film serials of the period, but with a lot more spit and polish. The special effects are great, the set decoration, costumes, makeup, all evoke the time and place perfectly.

 The plot about a prototype rocket pack that accidentally ends up in the hands of Cliff Secord is very strong. The film is filled with dozens of wonderful characterizations. Some of the best are Paul Sorvino as gangster Eddie Valentine, Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes, and Tiny Ron as Lothar. The musical score by James Horner is outstanding. It's heroic, quiet and inspiring. Why this film didn't turn out to be the big blockbuster it should have been is beyond me. This movie is clearly a five star film.

What I cannot, and will never understand is what happened to Rocketeer?

This movie blows me away every time I see it.  I FINALLY got to see it in widescreen because it just came out in Blu-ray, and it looks just FANTASTIC.  This should have been the first of a trilogy, or a long-line of movies.

It is not from a main stream comic book, so when I saw it was not a rehash of what I imagined as a little kid, and if it was, the movie makers took the story and made it fill the big screen with EVERYTHING a movie watcher would want.

What does bother me about the blu-ray disk is that there are no behind the scene extras.  I have a documentary about Rocketeer on VHS that I recorded off broadcast TV.  Would have liked to have seen more!!  The world econony is in a slump- maybe Disney could not afford more.  (That's where the Blu-ray loses a star- the movie lookes great!)

Did we see Rocketeer in the theaters when it came out?  No we did not.  I guess that is mystery number two.  My son was rather small at the time and another was on the way-  at least mystery 2 has a viable theory...

One more thing- the Captain America movie was entertaining, but no way did I believe the events that happened in WW2 in that movie.  It was a nice 21st century version of WW2.  Rocketeer, as far as I am concerned TOOK YOU BACK to the pre-war years just like the Indiana Jones films.  The story was great, unpredictable and entertaining.  The actors were all just great- every one of the hit their mark and more.  And just like Superman, you WILL believe a man can fly!!

You would sell it in the country that had those types of supporting DVD players right??

WRONG: NOT.....MovieMars

They sell worthless, and useless DVD's to honest and innocent un-suspecting Americans.  These DVD's are printed in English on the covers, leading you to believe that they are to be sold in America to english speaking Americans, who own American DVD players. But they mention somewhere in there wording that these are Region #2 DVD's.....Like Americans are supposed to be experts now on buying a DVD in our own country, and if I am not properly trained than I could be buying a DVD that won't work in America, but yet it's sold to Americans to watch.

Then to return it....you have to fill out a long Journal of paper work, and you have to pay to return it, and they keep the shipping fee's....by the time your done you get your $5.00 back for the cost of the DVD only.

Now lets be real here....come on...you know it and I know it....no body is going to return the DVD's, they just get taken for $5.00 X 1000 Americans = $5,000.00

My parents and I were at the end of a long vacation that saw us drive from Colorado back to Rhode Island right after my sophomore year of high school finished, stopping near the finish line in Toronto. I don't recall the name of the theater where we saw the film, but it was one of those old, grand movie palaces that was updated for THX and had the singular best stereo system I had ever come across (before or since).

Seeing the film with a packed audience on a Saturday matinee in that particular venue was just amazing, and the crowd - filled mostly with kids and their parents - laughed and cheered at all the right moments, even giving the Disney film a round of applause at the end.

For that reason, THE ROCKETEER has always been a film I've had a particular fondness for, though on-screen there's also much to admire in this Joe Johnston-directed adaptation of Dave Stevens' 1940s-set graphic novel. As scripted by Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo (who wrote the solid yet short-lived TV adaptation of ""The Flash"" around the same time), ""The Rocketeer"" stars Bill Campbell as a barnstorming pilot who improbably inherits a stolen top-secret jet pack that had been created by none other than Howard Hughes (""Lost""'s Terry O'Quinn). In hot pursuit of Hughes' creation are the mob, the FBI, and a dashing Errol Flynn-like movie hero (Timothy Dalton) with a secret agenda, all of whom try and wrestle the pack away from Campbell, who dons a helmet courtesy of pal Alan Arkin and takes to the skies in WWII era Southern California.

""The Rocketeer"" is nostalgic and fun, filled with period detail, gorgeous widescreen lensing, one of James Horner's best scores and pitch-perfect direction from Johnston, who would get another crack at helming a period super-hero film with last summer's ""Captain America."" Rewatching the film on Blu-Ray, it's even more rewarding now than it was then - made without an abundance of CGI and colorfully shot by Hiro Narita, the film may only be 20 years old but feels older (in a good way). It also feels less formulaic than so many of today's routine super-hero movies, moving at a brisk clip but still pausing to develop its characters without the contemporary helter-skelter editing that's designed to hold the attention spans of ADD-riddled viewers.

Jim Bissell's production design beautifully evokes the era and the cast is fine, from supporting roles filled by veterans like Dalton, Arkin and Paul Sorvino, down to Campbell in what would be one of his few lead performances and Jennifer Connelly as Jenny, the Rocketeer's love interest. Connelly never looked so luminous on-screen as she did here, years before dieting, plastic surgery and the course of time changed her voluptuous physical appearance into that of any other anorexic-looking modern leading lady. Johnston even throws in a nod to Hollywood's past by having a henchman made up like B-movie villain Rondo Hatton!

""The Rocketeer,"" sadly, performed only modestly at the box-office back in `91 but viewed now, ahead of all the various super-hero films we've seen, it holds up as one of the best of its kind: a rousing, old-fashioned entertainment, capped by one of Horner's finest scores - a real beauty - that adds immeasurably to the action.

For years, though, I've been unable to recapture the magic of seeing ""The Rocketeer"" in that Toronto theater. A widescreen laserdisc transfer sounded great but looked a bit fuzzy, while the domestic DVD edition didn't even include an anamorphically-enhanced presentation of the film (I did import the Region 4 DVD, which was 16:9, though not a great transfer by any means).

Neither did justice to the picture's visuals, but fortunately Disney's Blu-Ray edition does in an almost spectacular fashion. The AVC encoded 1080p transfer is dazzling, especially during the outdoor, aerial portions of the film. Bold colors, crisp detail, and no seeming use of DNR make for a gorgeous presentation all told, even if the movie's darker, studio-set portions are less impressive, showing the age of the master that was used. The DTS MA sound is certainly good, though seems a bit subdued from what I recall, and the sole extra is the theatrical trailer, culled off an old videotape master.

Despite the lack of extras, Disney has finally done ""The Rocketeer"" justice on Blu-Ray, where hopefully it will garner some new fans in the process. Highly recommended!",1337817600,4,4518,4.91994750656168

Set during the waning years of the great depression, it's a snapshot of a very specific period when America was beginning to pick itself up by the bootstraps, the atomic age was looming and not even the sky was the limit. At heart it's a silly, grinning action gimmick that's backed by a tried-and-true storyline and a stylish, art-deco-meets-dusty-barnstormer sense of fashion. Although the plot is inherently cheesy and predictable, it's straight-laced and innocent enough, a clear homage to '30s adventure serials, that I was willing to let most of those shortcomings slide. The special effects haven't aged well at all, though, with several obvious green screens and a few rough, quick cuts sticking out in all the wrong ways. Timothy Dalton is disappointing as the pencil-stached villainous saboteur, but Jennifer Connelly and leading man Bill Campbell fully commit to the premise, picking up the slack adequately. Inoffensive and silly, it's as good as it was ever going to be; a wild kids' ride that the parents won't mind tagging along for.",1335744000,,1140,5.101604278074866

The plot never got going when one of the spies got cold feet and turned himself in, needless to say the other spies where arrested, so yes, the plot of the Rocketeer is plausible. This movie in my opinion, is one of the most underrated movies of all time. Every actor shines in this movie, Bill Campbell as Cliff. The Beautiful Jennifer Connelly as Jenny, Timothy Dalton as the nazi spy. And yes and indirect reference to the slanderous name given to Mr flynn, nevill Sinclair. Whether it's intentional or not, who knows. Personally I think too much was read into this movie, it's set in 1939. Based on a comic book by Dave Stevens, a high flying adventure. It doesn't try to be anything it's not, a small time test pilot thrust into mystery, and intrigue. My only complaint with the DVD, is that they haven't released a special edition of this movie yet. Enough time has passed, and yes. I've seen the Q&A with several of the actors online, plus a rumor that they're going to remake this movie.

454698,5,6302269431,"Somehow as a kid I missed watching this film, but I amended this oversight during college by acquiring the standard DVD edition of the film. ""The Rocketeer"" blew me away, not due to intensity of action or spectacle, but instead by a quality increasingly rare in our blockbusters... its heart. The film undeniably wears its earnestness on its sleeve, but the result is far from cheesy, manifesting into an atmosphere of excitement and wonder that hearkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age and the old 1930s serials. Aside from the better Indiana Jones films, ""Rocketeer"" is probably the best homage you can find to that style of storytelling. Not that the film is perfect -- far from it -- but ""Rocketeer"" uncannily manages to turn many of its flaws in its favor. They add to the charm, as does James Horner's rousing score, which ranks easily among his very best.

Yet ""The Rocketeer"" has never been the unqualified success it deserves to be, having had the misfortune of opening against a little indie film you may have heard of called ""Terminator 2."" It was unceremoniously dumped on VHS and then the aforementioned DVD -- a barebones disc with a non-anamorphic, smeary mess of a transfer that, on today's HD televisions, is damn near unwatchable.

Enter this ""20th Anniversary Edition"" Blu-ray. Video is pretty good for a film of its budget, production methods, and vintage; not reference quality, but certainly a vast, VAST improvement on the wretched DVD. Audio is slightly disappointing with a distinct lack of LFE in the sound effects, but James Horner's score sounds wonderful.

Most disappointing is the almost complete lack of bonus material. The menu is stylish and the disc even uses BD-Java, but the only available extra outside the film is a standard-definition trailer. For a release billed as a ""20th Anniversary Edition,"" this defies logic. Surely a retrospective featurette is called for at the very least? According to The Digital Bits, cameras were present at a 20th Anniversary screening at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood that included a Q&A with the filmmakers, so I suppose it is possible that they are saving features for a future release, but given this title's treatment in the past another, later release on Blu-ray seems unlikely.

In summary, five stars for the movie, four stars for the video, three stars for the audio, and no stars for the extras. Why, then, is the overall rating for this review five stars? Because, with today's equipment, all previous video releases of the film are unwatchable, and the quality of the upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray is easily worth five stars, especially considering the quality of the movie, and frankly we are lucky to have this Blu-ray at all considering the film's reputation as a box-office flop and as something of a stepchild for Disney. Considering that a future, feature-laden Blu-ray upgrade is highly improbable, this ""20th Anniversary Edition"" is highly recommended.",1325376000,43,2947,4.995926680244399
454699,4,6302269431,"There hasn't been a whole lot of fanfare, but for fans of Dave Stevens' graphic novels and Joe Johnston's 1991 Disney big-screen spectacular, the appearance of The Rocketeer on Blu-ray is somewhat of an event.

On the package is a sticker proclaiming, ""From the director of Captain America."" Clearly this release is piggybacking on the successful 2011 film -- and the two films seem, at least to me, inextricably linked by their setting and their director.

But why did The Rocketeer run out of propellant while Captain America blasted the box office? The most obvious reason is that the Marvel character has had more mainstream visibility, though the '60s cartoon and '70s live-action series incarnations of Captain America were not exactly stellar. It's also a tricky matter to set a film in WWII, or during the '40s and make it resound with younger audiences.

Just because The Rocketeer wasn't a smash, it isn't fair to dismiss it as some did back in the '90s. Actually, it's quite a fine film, with a likable cast led by Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly and Alan Arkin, as well as a scene-chewing tour-de-force performance by Timothy Dalton -- clearly having a grand old time playing a thorough rotter.

The Rocketeer has very good effects for its time, superb art direction and photography, and one of the best background scores of the last several decades. I highly recommend the soundtrack album of James Horner's sweeping score. You can also hear this music as the Epcot fountains dance regularly, as well as in countless movie trailers for other releases.

Hopes were just a little too high for The Rocketeer. Disney was looking for a huge franchise, so a well-done, nicely received film wouldn't cut it. Even though Johnston only mentions The Rocketeer once briefly in his Captain America commentary (alas, he did not do one for The Rocketeer Blu-ray -- there are no extras to speak of), clearly the director learned and developed over the years.

Perhaps the main issue between the two films is tone. The Rocketeer is highly stylized and inconsistently campy with a hero who's a little too cocky for his own good, while Captain America is a hybrid between retro, comic book and contemporary action movie style, with a much more sympathetic hero.

But if you haven't seen The Rocketeer in Blu-ray, prepare for a treat. The spot-on animated sequence, the lavish nightclub scene, and even the sarcophagus-like dwelling of the villain are as vivid as can be. You just have to approach The Rocketeer as a jaunty romp and enjoy the ride.",1324425600,3,2544,4.888631090487239

454705,4,6302269431,"I finally saw ""The Rocketeer"" for the first time earlier this year; I was pleasantly surprised by its low-key charm. The set design, cinematography, and costuming of this movie perfectly capture the 1938 era in which it is set. The glowing color seen on this stellar high-def transfer makes the movie seem as if it were a 3-Strip Technicolor classic. Casting is top-notch as well; Billy Campbell perfectly embodies the down-on-his-luck hero, Cliff Secord, who stumbles upon a Howard Hughes designed back pack that transforms him into The Rocketeer. Timothy Dalton is a very convincing villain, and Jennifer Connelly has the perfect ratio of sweet and sexy as the heroine of the story.

By capturing the flavor of a 1930's serial, ""The Rocketeer"" avoids the pitfalls of attempting to be a special effects laden Hollywood Blockbuster. This movie stands up well to the competition with a number of subtle inside jokes (such as what happened to the last four letters of the original Hollywoodland sign), well-played double-entendres (the sequence with W.C. Fields is wonderful), and an overall feel-good tone that allows the audience to have hope in the underdog and hiss at the villain all at the same time...while watching true-love conquer all. You can't help but feel good after seeing ""The Rocketeer."" Warning - there is a bit of violence in this movie, making it a tad inappropriate for the very young set (even if it is a Disney movie!).

Besides the superb high-def transfer, this 20th Anniversary all boasts a very clean soundtrack (DTS-HD Master Audio English & Dolby Digital Audio French tracks) that shows off the James Horner score to full advantage. Plenty of good separation that comes into play with the aviation sequences.

The big surprise is the lack of extras. You get one theatrical trailer...all 2 minutes and 19 seconds of it. Not really what I would call a 20th Anniversary edition. It would appear that Disney didn't want to put too much effort into this disc.

454716,5,6302269431,"I love this movie!  In fact, it's one of my favorites.  Ever since back when I was a kid, and built model airplanes, I've been crazy about planes and really wanted to learn to fly, but it was always just out of my reach, financially.
Now, of course, even if you had a pilot's license, it would cost you a young fortune to fly, at all.
As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best, if not the very best, action/adventure/fantasy movies ever made.  It just drew you into it, and made you feel as though you were actually there, living the whole very exciting adventure.
Anyway, the plane in the opening sequence was a real plane - an early 30's era Gee Bee racer, which was built specifically with those stubby wings to bank around pylons in air races, which were all the rage in the early days of aviation.
And the rocket pack, which the whole movie is about, is not a myth, either.  I remember seeing newsreels in the 40's, about the whole idea of strapping a rocket to your back and taking off into the wild blue yonder.
In reality, though, all you would probably succeed in doing would be driving yourself about 10 feet into the ground, because you wouldn't have wings, hence, no lift, nor any way to guide yourself, even if you did get airborne.
Besides, how would you land?
But it was a neat idea.  I'm pretty sure that they produced at least a prototype.  I don't know if anybody ever actually tried to fly one, but I seriously doubt it.
I read one review that stated that he thought the villain (the ugly giant) was wearing a rubber mask. That is true - the original man, who looked exactly like that, was a real person - Rondo Hatton - who had a physical deformity, but who died in 1946.  Ironically, he had been voted the most handsome man in his high school class, but contracted a terrible disease as an adult, which disfigured him horribly.  Although he did look like that, he was just normal height (5'9"").  He appeared in several movies, always as a villain.
So they made a rubber mask, and another actor, Tiny Ron, played the role.
But Jennifer Connelly is an absolute knockout, and Timothy Dalton makes a perfect suave English/German double agent/spy.

I look forward to its release on blu-ray, although like some others have mentioned, I sincerely hope that there are some special features.  The Rocketeer opened in the summer of 1991 in a particularly poor time period.  The week before it opened the tremendously successful ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"" premiered and the week after The Rocketeer, Arnold returned in ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day.""  As a result, The Rocketeer was lost in the mix and never found its audience.  Disney had hoped to turn it into a series, the disappointing grosses ended that.
The Rocketeer creates a lavish look at the Hollywood of the late 1930s.  Director Joe Johnston does the same fabulous job creating that time period that he did this summer with the terrific ""Captain America.""  Bill Campbell is properly heroic as The Rocketeer, a young Jennifer Connelly fabulously beautiful as his girlfriend and Alan Arkin does a very nice job as Campbell's sidekick and mechanic Peevey.  Timothy Dalton, 2 years after playing Bond for the last time, is great as Neville Sinclair, a dashing movie star (obviously patterned after Errol Flynn) and Nazi spy.  The great Terry O'Quinn makes an apppearance as Howard Hughes and Paul Sorvino is a patriotic gangster who sends his hoods against the Nazis.  Theres a wonderful, old fashioned patriotic feel to this film.  It probably would have done better after 9/11.  The special effects are great.  The end with the Rocketeer fighting a particularly scary killer, based on the real-life 1940's horror actor, Rondo Hatten, aboard a burning zeppilin in flight is terifically exciting.  The film also features a lovely and lavish score by the great James Horner.
This is one of my favorite comic book films and, as stated, Joe Johnston does a great job.  Hes obviously the man to go to for period-piece comic book films.  It is a shame that it did not do better at the time of its release, but at least it has now become a popular cult film.

454723,3,6302269431,"I was THRILLED to learn that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment would be releasing ""The Rocketeer"" on Blu-Ray on December 13, 2011.  It is one of my all-time favorite films, and one that I knew I would buy on Day One of its release.  However, when word came out that the Blu-Ray disc would contain NO special features, my thrill at buying this film lessened slightly.

""The Rocketeer"" is an endearing classic, and one that deserves a full Special Edition treatment, with bonus features such as commentary, retrospective documentary, photo galleries, trailers, and deleted scenes.  I was completely dismayed and disheartened to learn that NONE of those features will be on the upcoming Blu-Ray.  I most likely will no longer purchase ""The Rocketeer"" on the day of its release, as the quality of the product is now less than I expected.  Rather, I will wait for the disc to go on sale below $15 (whenever that may be) instead of immediately pay the suggested retail price for what is essentially a movie-only Blu-Ray disc.

It's a decision I'd rather not make, and I'm hoping that between now and December, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will re-evaluate the release plans for ""The Rocketeer"" and decide to include bonus features.  Even if this means delaying the release to include bonus features such as a director's commentary and a new making-of documentary (along with any archival material I will list below), it will definitely be worth the wait, and would certainly make me consider buying this film on its release day once again.

Just as an example, here are some excellent archival material that already exists within the company's archives that can be included:

-20th Anniversary Screening Q&A Session - when D23 screened ""The Rocketeer"" at El Capitan this past June (the 21st), they held a Q&A session after the film, in which director Kevin Smith fielded questions to director Joe Johnston, star Bill Campbell, writers Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo, artist William Stout and make-up guru Rick Baker.  If this event was recorded, it would make for an excellent inclusion on the Blu-Ray disc.

-The theatrical trailer - this was already included in the Laserdisc and DVD.  A remastered version (in HD) would make for an excellent inclusion, as it not only provides historical context for the marketing of the film, but is a no-brainer for inclusion on any home media release.

-""The Rocketeer: Excitement in the Air"" - this is a television special that aired on June 19, 1991 before the film's theatrical release.  It was never included on Laserdisc or DVD, sadly.  Like the trailer, it makes for a great contemporary piece that is related to the film's original release.  I remember watching this when I was six years old and getting really excited for the film.  It would be wonderful to see it again.

-Electronic Press Kit Interviews - if the above documentary cannot be used, then surely the interviews done for the special could be included, either on their own or re-edited into a brand-new making-of feature.

-""Meet Me Down at the El Capitan"" - when the film premiered on June 21, 1991, there was a lot of celebration at the El Capitan, including a song-and-dance number, ""Meet Me Down at the El Capitan.""  I've never seen it before, but I'm fairly certain it will exist somewhere in the vast archives.

-Photo & Poster Galleries - this is rather self-explanatory, as hundreds of photos and posters must exist in the archives.  There was a HUGE marketing bonanza for the film when it came out.  In addition, it is always exciting to see how the film was marketed in its time, both domestically and internationally.

-""The Rocketeer"" Topps Trading Cards - there were 121 total cards in this collection, as well as 11 stickers.  I used to have several from when I was a child, but sadly lost them through the years.  Seeing them again in high-definition scans on a Blu-Ray disc would be wonderful.

If any of these suggestions are ultimately included when ""The Rocketeer"" is released to Blu-Ray, I will be a very satisfied customer who will buy the disc on its release date, and definitely would recommend purchase of the Blu-Ray to my friends.  Until then, I'll have to pass and wait for a better price, as even Amazon.com's $18.99 is too much for just the film by itself.  Hopefully, come December 13 I can update this review to share my excitement and customer satisfaction for a Blu-Ray disc that's worth buying.

EDITED TO ADD (December 2): I recently read an online review for the product, and it notes that the ONLY bonus feature is the theatrical trailer.  Needless to say, I sent the following to Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment...

Three months ago, I wrote to Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment to voice my disappointment and dismay at their upcoming release of ""The Rocketeer"" on Blu-Ray.  I asked the studio to re-consider their decision of excluding any bonus features on the title, and offered suggestions for what type of material they could include.  A few weeks later, I received an e-mail from the Legal Department, thanking me for my e-mail, but further stressing that they do not accept unsolicited ideas.  That was understandable, and I had hoped that WDSHE at least considered the option of adding any bonus features at all (outside the realm of features I suggested).

Recently, I read an online review for ""The Rocketeer"" on Blu-Ray, and the review makes sure to note that the only bonus feature included is the theatrical trailer.  Needless to say, I was disappointed in reading this.  While I'm happy that the trailer was included (especially since WDSHE never includes the trailer of a newly-released movie, but is fine adding 10 trailers of upcoming movies), I'm still upset that no other bonus features were commissioned for production or even licenced out of the studio archives.

I am telling all my friends to not purchase this title, and I myself will not be purchasing it either.  It is very upsetting that the studio - who has put out excellent Blu-Rays such as ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and ""TRON"" - has given such inferior treatment to a home media product that has the capacity and ability to feature more than just the movie.  While I'm sure the technical presentation of the film is excellent (the review I read made sure to bring notice to that), I cannot accept that there are virtually no bonus features on this title.  I sincerely hope you revisit this title again in the future, with the intent of adding special features that make it worth of the ""20th Anniversary Edition"" banner that the current inferior product now carries.",1315526400,24,6640,4.844109831709478
454724,3,6302269431,"I recently rewatched this movie in honor of its 20th anniversary in the summer of 2011. I hadn't seen it since it came out in theaters, when I was quite young. From what I recall, the movie was something of a box-office bomb. While it's certainly not a bad movie and didn't deserve to bomb, I can definitely understand why it never caught on widely.

First, the plot is just thin. The movie is about 140 minutes long, and for an ""action/adventure"" movie much of that is taken up by dialogue. I don't need a fight scene every second, but the movie should find some way of keeping the tension going. Also, the movie reveals WHO the main villain is right near the beginning of the story, but doesn't reveal WHY he's a villain until near the end. This seems exactly the opposite of how it should have progressed. The movie would have been much more suspenseful if we'd learned of the Nazi threat earlier, but didn't know one of the main characters was a Nazi spy. Instead, the scenes with Jenny and Sinclair (the Nazi spy) dating become too predictable.

A weak plot can be saved by strong characters, but at best the main characters in Rocketeer are milquetoast. The main character, Cliff (Billy Campbell), is a ""good boy"" in the style of older 1930s movies. He's impossible not to like, but he's also hard to really love. His girlfriend, Jenny, barely has a personality, although I suspect that's partly due to Jennifer Connelly's acting, which I've always found dry. The worst is Timothy Dalton as the main villain just doesn't work for me. He never comes across as threatening. Moreover, a Nazi spy placed within the ""highest social circles of Hollywood"" sounds more goofy than ominous.

The movie does have its fun parts. The secondary villain, Eddie Valentine, is interesting. The huge ""enforcer"" works well as a menacing goon. And Rocketeer does overall stick closely to its 1930s roots. But overall this just seems like a movie that could have worked so much better than it currently does. It could have been the second coming of Indiana Jones, but learned little from Spielberg and Lucas about keeping the audience excited.",1309824000,3,2128,4.71505376344086

Excellent movie for the whole family to view. The scene takes places in the late 30's or early 40's where Germany is trying to develop rockets for its soliders to wear. Germany has a spy in the US who learns that Howard Hughes has developed an experimental rocket and is stolen but is found by someone else who has a friend who is an inventor.

when you consider Disney himself was a reactionary who reportedly contributed money secretly to his buddy Hoover so the FBI could spy on Dr. King, it is not surprising Disney Studios still miss the mark so frequently and wildly;

however, this movie is a comic book gem that ranks right up there with Jimmy Smits' ""The Cisco Kid"", Antonio Banderas' ""Zorro"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" and ""The Four Musketeers"";

though not deft as ""Pirates of the Carribean"" nor dark as ""Iron Man"" or ""Batman"", nor anything like so violent as ""Sin City"" or ""Give 'em Hell Malone"", it is neither preachy like ""Superman"" or ""Star Trek IV"";

in short, like ""Sky Captain"", ""Zorro"", ""Cisco Kid"", Mickey Rooney's ""The Black Stallion"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and Gregory Peck's ""Captain Horatio Hornblower"", you can watch this over and over again with any part or even all your family, and each time it will be a rollicking ride fresh as the popcorn you make for the occasion;",1296259200,,1176,4.778325123152709

Rocketeer was originally a comic book and at a time when the studios were not that into comic book film adapataions, Dave Stevens' baby took off.  Yes, it bombed at the box office, barely making its budget, but that was more the fault of marketing the film than the plot.

It's a very hackneyed plot, but the way the actors pull it off is really fun to watch.  I loved Jennifer Connely, who would later make it as a bit TV actress, as the naive Jenny.

There were some over the top moments though:  How did a complete company of Nazi commandoes get onto US soil towards the end of the film to back up the Nazi spy Sinclair?  And where the heck did they get that blimp?

The giant hoodlum had a clearly plastic mask and when he talked his lips hardlyl moved.  Was a bit funny, that.  Reminded me of ""Jaws"" in the James Bond films.  In fact the actor who played Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) has himself been in a few Bond films.

The best thing about the film was the way they imitated the 1930s period, complete with art deco nightclub, the snarly gangster who runs the place, and the music.

Cliff discovers a top secret, stolen rocket pack the mobsters hid to reclaim later, and with a helmet created by his mechanic and best friend, Peevy, Cliff becomes 1930's superhero ""The Rocketeer"". The series of adventurous exploits that follow are largely due to the missing rocket pack in question, as it is the key to one Nazi spy's secret plan to help the bad guys rule the world!

Though, for whatever reason (perhaps not enough public awareness of the comic book character), ""The Rocketeer"" was a flop in theaters despite critical praise, audiences eventually came to their senses and gave the film a much deserved cult status. Disney's 1991 film ""The Rocketeer"" was a truly wonderful movie from probably the greatest period at the Walt Disney Company. Based on a comic book by Dave Stevens that is, believe it or not, from 1982, not 1938 when the story is set, ""The Rocketeer"" captures a classic feel with a spot on cast and is a shining example of Disney at its peak. Timothy Dalton is a fantastic, suave villain and Bill Campbell and Jennifer Connelly (looking stunning here as her Bettie Page inspired character) are perfectly cast as the sweet, young, heroic couple that the film is centered on. Full of great effects and a fun and exciting, solid story, this is one that should be in every movie fan's collection.

One of the best Comic-book based movies ever! this soaring and stunning adventure is like a retro-style dream come true from director Joe Johnson. Based on the cult graphic novel ""The Rocketeer"" by Dave Stevens, this one is very faithful to the source and takes audiences back to 30's and 40's style adventure serial cinema much like Raiders of the Lost Ark did back in 1981. I remembered when i was 9 in the summer of 1991 i saw this in a theater and it blew me away as i had some of the merchandise including a T-shirt to some cards, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and a great movie to add to your comic book movie collection for it's also one of Disney's best underrated cult classics.

Barely has the work been completed when, on her first official test flight, Cliff blunders into the midst of a running duel between the FBI and a pair of gangsters who've made off with an experimental jet-propulsion backpack created by Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn) and the plane is nearly totalled.  But Cliff, through a twist of fate, gains possession of the pack and sees it as a way to gain enough money to ""make a fresh start"" and get into the Nationals after all.  Peevy is dubious but comes up with improvements to the design, and Cliff becomes an instant hero when he rescues a flying clown at a local air show.  What he doesn't know is that the people who stole the pack were simply soldiers for organized-crime figure and nightclub owner Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino), who in turn was in the pay of a Nazi agent, Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton), ""the number-three box-office attraction in the country"" and a hero of Cliff's girlfriend, aspiring film actress Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly).  Or that Sinclair has discovered he has the pack--and will stop at nothing to obtain it.

(There's a delightful bit of business when Valentine realizes he's being played for a sucker by a Nazi stooge and rejects Sinclair with the declaration that he's ""a hundred per cent American,"" and viewers who know something about Hughes's career will pick up on a reference to his famous wooden aircraft the Spruce Goose.)

454769,5,6302269431,"It's pretty cool (in my opinion anyway) to only vaguely remember images of a movie and then many years later, rediscover it and still find it great. A long, long time ago in a living room not so far away, I saw this on television and, like many movies in my youth, it almost faded into complete obscurity. Fortunately I came across it and picked it up. It's a great period action piece, reminding me of the great pulp-comic adventures of the 1930s and 40s (if only the heroes in today's comics would have cool adventures instead of ""brooding"" for about 20 pages in a book that costs $3.99). The acting from everyone is great, Tim Dalton especially as he pulls off the villain quite well. A complete reversal for him at the time as I think he was still signed on as James Bond (I may be wrong about that). The only one who I'm surprised didn't go anywhere was the lead (again I may be wrong this is the only thing I've seen the guy in). Even the supporting cast is memorable, the guy who plays Howard Hughes is a definite standout (making me wonder why he wasn't cast in that movie about Hughes compared to that guy who was in Titanic). The sets remind me of the Art-Deco design of the period (something that was made even more impressive in the animated Batman and Superman series). The action pieces are well staged and executed, the end sequence aboard the blimp is a standout. Before the swash-buckling action and confusing plots of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, I think this might've been Disney's attempt to have an action franchise akin to Warner Bros.' Superman and Batman films, but of course, the people at Disney just have to mess with something that doesn't need messin' with (Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers comes to mind). While I must admit that the Pirates' films, while confusing, do have great action sequences, its the only franchise they have that appeals to a broader audience (or, as I'll explain next, a bigger male audience). Other than that they only market to the little kiddies with princess, teen ""pop sensations"" with bad wigs & fashions and musicals that don't represent anything that goes on in high school. I just think that Disney should make films that can appeal to an older audience as well instead of trying to turn everything into a 90 minute toy commercial. I know Disney has an image, but when they make films that shake their status quo (this film and Hunchback come to mind) with a slightly more mature story, it could end up making them more money with newer, fresher ideas (if there's any of that left in Hollywood) compared to just rehashing old ideas (Princess and the Frog), remaking their own films (seriously, stop that, 101 Dalmations was just bad and Alice...just seems...weird) or just continuing with passing fads (again ""pop stars"" with bad wigs and high schools that don't exist even in imagination).",1272585600,,2858,4.6390532544378695

454795,5,6302269431,"I have always loved this movie. I will never stop loving this movie. It reminds me of the time when directors made film with a love for the craft as opposed to these hacks that make films for the love of money. In this day and time you will rarely find a movie that is this fun to watch and has a good story to boot.

The plot is simple enough: Cliff Secord(Bill Campbell) finds a rocket in his airplane. This rocket is sought after by mobsters and a Nazi spy working undercover as an actor named Neville Sinclair(Timothy Dalton). Cliff uses the rocket to thwart Sinclair's gang.

Bill Campbell is perfect as Cliff Secord. He's headstrong but still immensely likable. Jennifer Connelly is great as his girlfriend Jenny Blake and Alan Arkin gives a strong performance as Cliff's mentor but wise best friend Peevy. Timothy Dalton gives one of his best performances to date as Neville Sinclair. Neville Sinclair is a great villain without being over-the-top with it. I've always like Timothy Dalton as an actor even when he played James Bond. Paul Sorvino's role as the mobster Eddie Valentine shouldn't go unnoticed either.

The thing I like most about The Rocketeer is that its a fun movie. Watching Cliff test the rocket for the first time remains in my mind in a place so snug. The director respects the time period(1930s) without contradicting it(like a few directors that do period pieces tend to do). In short its a blast from the 90s that is more enjoyable than the overrated dross that is out now. Its definitely worth a second look.

Before I leave I will say this: do not take directors like Joe Johnston for granted or you will be responsible for the onslaught of Follywood hacks. I've seen Joe Johnston's whole catalog of films and have yet to find one stinker among them. He's earned my trust and how many directors can you say that about? Not many. In conclusion support directors that respect the art of film-making or you will be sorry when all that is left are the hacks. Think about it.",1246579200,4,2002,4.599439775910364

454797,4,6302269431,"The Rocketeer is one of those movies I find myself drawn to about once a year if not more. Mainly because of the interesting story, beautiful and unusual airplanes, good acting, excellent costumes and props, and a great film score by James Horner. It all really makes you feel you are visiting California in the 1930s. The story centers around a pilot named Cliff Secord, delightfully played by Bill Campbell, testing a Bee Gee racer for the National Air Race. When gangsters running from the police and government agents shoot up his plane. They leave an unexpected present in the hanger, a rocket pack. He ends up trying it out with the assistance of his mechanic Peevy, wonderfully played by Alan Arkan. It turns out the rocket pack was stolen from Howard Hughes, well played by Terry O'Quinn (John Locke on ""Lost"").

An Errol Flynn like movie star, Neville Sinclair, mischievously played by Timothy Dalton and a gang boss, Eddie Valentine,  nicely played by Paul Sorvino want the rocket pack. Lots of action as Cliff and Peevy try to keep it from them long enough for Cliff to save his girlfriend Jenny Blake, wholesomely played by Jennifer Connelly, from the clutches of the Nazis. I was always disappointed they didn't make a sequel or two. Who knows maybe new life will be breathed into this series as happened with the Batman movies. I hope Disney will distribute a cleaned up copy on Blu-ray with several extras. My original Disney DVD was not the best of transfers.

To me, it's a perfect film. There's not one thing I'd change about it, and it's always a treat to take it off the shelf, stick it in the DVD player and transport myself back to the late 1930's with the daring pilot Cliff Secord, the beautiful actress Jenny Blake and the dashing and villianous Neville Sinclair!

Dave Stevens graphic novel -- an obvious tip of the hat to Republic serial classics such as RADAR MEN ON THE MOON and KING OF THE ROCKETMEN.  Too bad, nice performances by Bill Campbell as a barn storming pilot in 1938, Alan Arkin as his sidekick mechanic, the lovely (and very young) Jennifer Connolly as the girl friend, Paul Sorvino as a gangster,  and ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton as an Errol Flynn type as a Nazi! (The latter probaby influenced by a book by Charles Higgins in the 1980's that claimed that Flynn was a Nazi agent.)  Though it sank at the box office, I highly look forward to this delightful romp on Blu Ray which even has a Rondo Hatton henchman and a grand finale on a dirgible!  On of those films that were meant to be a series -- like DOC SAVAGE, THE SHADOW, THE PHANTOM -- that never came to be.  Too bad.  It had everything working for it.",1215734400,,1044,4.21608040201005
454835,5,6302269431,"I remember as a young boy absolutely loving this movie.  At every sleepover this movie was mandatory.  I probably saw `The Rocketeer' a record fifty times as a child and then, sadly, I grew up.  In fact I haven't seen this movie in almost ten years.  Well, I guess I should say `hadn't' as in that I hadn't seen this movie in almost ten years, because thankfully I caught this movie on Encore the other night and since then it's the only movie I've been able to think of.  Sure, this is not a perfect film, but for its genre, for its target audience it `is' perfect.  As the film began I felt like a little boy once again; all those childish chills of excitement taking over me, and soon I was fully amerced in the world of my youth, and loving every minute of it.

`The Rocketeer' tells the story of 1930's pilot Cliff Secord, a young and ambitious young man who is on his way to the top.  By chance Cliff stumbles upon a rocket pack and decides that it may be a surefire way to make some extra money.  That rocket pack, designed by Howard Hughs himself, is stolen property though and is being pursued by some very dangerous men.  Heading the pursuit is dashing Hollywood movie star Neville Sinclair, a man who is not who he seems.  Knowing that Secord has the rocket pack he decides to get closer to Secord's girlfriend Jenny who is aspiring to act alongside Sinclair.  Soon Cliff finds that this newfound device, while being the root of all his newfound problems, may be the only way to save his friends and, in the larger scope of things, the world.

Sure, the plot is a little thick at times, but remember folks, this is a superhero movie based off of a popular (at the time) graphic novel so it is not necessarily supposed to be possible, just plausible.  Judging from the respect this film delivers wonderfully.

Bill Campbell serves as a fine hero here, giving Cliff a believable sense of natural charm.  He seems like a real person, not some fabled heroic creation.  Alan Arkin is delightful as Cliff's mechanic buddy Peevy.  He's the trusty sidekick, sure, and his character is clich&eacute; ridden, but he owns it.  Jennifer Connelly is magnificent here.  She has that throwaway stock role of the love interest here, but she makes Jenny lovable and relatable and memorable.  She is probably my favorite thing about this movie.  Timothy Dalton is every bit dashing as he is sinister; truly a memorable and respectable villainous turn.

`The Rocketeer' is jam packed with action and adventure and is seriously tailor-made for each and every young boy (and all of us `men' who want to embrace our inner `boy').  It's fun and exciting and thrilling and just all around great entertainment.  It's a shame that this franchise didn't take off.  A `Rocketeer' trilogy would have been amazing (at least to me) and much preferred to some of the films that get made these days.  It may not have been embraced at the time, but that doesn't mean we can't embrace it today.  This is a classic example of smart and refreshing family entertainment that holds up even today amidst a world of computer generated pirate ships and elf princesses.",1213920000,3,3137,4.583482944344704

(I was using the Region 2 DVD which has a colorful, widescreen transfer.)  Jack Horner's rousing score still stirs my blood -- enough that I bought the CD.  One reviewer from Texas thinks that Jenny's cleavage is a bit too expansive for young boys, but this is a cartoon brought to life, and, as in Roger Rabbit, many things seem exaggerated. The reference to Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose is lost on the current teen generation (""She really does fly!""), but the sheer joy of the film, as exemplified by the Rocketeer skimming across a pond, then uttering the best line in the film, ""I like it!"" is something any age can appreciate.

The Rocketeer reflects the simpliticy, moral values, and conviction to triumph over the Axis powers that drove these pictures.  You knew if our fate was entrusted to a lanterned jaw hero in jodpurs, riding boots and a leather bomber jacket, everything would turn out right.

And unlike the orginal serials, the acting in the Rocketeer is pretty good.  Timothy Dalton makes a particularly smarmy villian, and Alan Arkin a great 'Mr. Science' side-kick (look out Dr, Zarkov). Both leads are also very good.

Jennifer Connelly is beautiful chubby or skinny, and Alan Arkin always turns in a great performance.

No doubt my rating and memories of this movie are influenced by the great times with my daughter.

The Movie gets a FIVE STAR from me.

454841,4,6302269431,"`The Rocketeer' is a really fine piece of escapist cinema that, in slightly better world, would have made a lot more money for the studio.  But to the misfortune of Disney, this film was released about 10 minutes before `Terminator 2.' The producers of `T2' cynically calculated that the summertime movie-going public, dominated as it is by adolescent males, would prefer the steroid-saturated sadism of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  `T2' stole the audience from this film, and `The Rocketeer' quickly faded into relative obscurity.  (Based on the box office of similar fantasy pieces set in the 1930's, such as `The Shadow,' `The Phantom,' and `Sky Captain and the World of Tommorrow,' it might also be true that the audience for retro-thrills has dwindled.  Too bad, because those films were good.  The horrid 2005 version of `King Kong,' set in the 1930's, was profitable.  But I attribute that to the effectiveness of the studio machine and to the personality cult around director Peter Jackson.)

But `The Rocketeer' is, of course, vastly superior to `T2,' and deserves to be ranked as a classic within the genre of comic book, fantasy, and adventure movies.  If your taste runs more toward `The Adventures of Robin Hood' or the Indiana Jones films than, say, the `Die Hard' series or Steven Segal, then `The Rocketeer' is for you.

Also, if you thought `The Aviator,' particularly the airplane sequences were cool, you might get a bang out of this.  Howard Hughes plays an important part of the plot, and there is an `in' joke for you.

In addition, fans of old movie serials and old sci-fi should love this.  Odds are you already know that the original inspiration for the character of the Rocketeer was the 1949 Republic serial `King of the Rocketmen.'",1202428800,,1754,4.928571428571429

There is even a mock Nazi propaganda film to illustrate the awesome power of this new weapon. In fact, the film really blurs fantasy with reality, with appearances by W.C. Fields and Cab Calloway, among others. Timothy Dalton plays Neville Sinclair, an actor whose life bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Errol Flynn's. Fiction mixed with reality can be amusing because it offers an imaginative alternative to straight fiction and non-fiction. On the other hand, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" ""JFK"" and the current Bush administration have all proven mixing fantasy and reality can produce downright ugly results. There is some very good action as The Rocketeer, played by the dashing and handsome Bill Campbell, eludes the Nazis and attempts to foil their plot. Jennifer Connelly is radiant as his love interest, Jenny Blake. This is the type of movie where gray areas do not exist; everything is either black or white, good or bad.

Not an indictment of Spielberg's work, just a partial explanation for why I enjoyed ""The Rocketeer"" so much. It's a love letter to Hollywood and to early aviation, and if you actually know a little about these two subjects the movie makes a lot more sense.

One reviewer stated he found the concept of Nazi spies and soldiers in Hollywood hard to believe -- yet the German Abwehr did drop several spies by parachute into the West country of England. All were ill-prepared and captured almost immediately, but clearly the idea was out there. As for soldiers, note that the Hindenberg carried Nazi soldiers regularly, and in 1938 we weren't at war.

The same reviewer also found the giant assassin unbelievable, but this movie _is_ a fantasy, after all, and the character is clearly based not only on the appearance of the real 1930's and 40's actor Rondo Hatton, but on the kind of character he frequently portrayed.

BLU-RAY REVIEW:

Disney has given us a very nice looking Blu-ray debut for ""The Rocketeer. Although the image is occasionally a bit soft the overall detail, depth and colors are far superior to every previous edition of the movie. The film looks exceptionally good for a film that is 20 years old.

We get a nice 5.1 lossless mix--it won't blow you away the way that, say, ""Transformers: The Dark Side of the Moon"" audio might, but it's immersive and sounds extremely good with crisp, clear dialogue.

Special Features: Someone missed the boat at the Mouse house here--we get the theatrial trailer and really nothing else of worth. That's just wrong since there's A LOT of material out there on the making of teh film.

4 stars for the transfer which looks extremely good and 1/s star for the ""special Feature"".

Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) and ""Peevy"" (Alan Arkin) have put together a cutting edge stunt plane. During a test flight the plane is destroyed in an accident involving the FBI and the Mob. It seems the Mob has stolen a revolutionary rocket packet designed by Howard Hughes (the great Terry O'Quinn)which the U.S. wants to use for military purposes. Unfortunately, so do the Nazi's who hired Mob kingpin Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino) to steal it. Secord accidently comes into possession of the rocket pack and suddenly everyone from Hollywood actor/Nazi agent Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) to the FBI want to catch him and retrieve it.

ORIGINAL DVD REVIEW:

This is a fun witty film of the graphic novel. The DVD transfer looks so-so. The image is frequently too dark and there's lots of digital artifacts (aliasing, etc.) that mar the picture. Presented in widescreen, it's not enhanced for 16x9 sets and doesn't appear to be an anamorphic transfer either. Why does all that matter? Because on a widescreen TV it would have enhanced and improved the picture quality making it look sharp, vivid and alive.  The original theatrical trailer is the only extra. I don't know if Disney has any immediate plans to reissue this but if you do purchase it, be aware that it doesn't look all that great on DVD because of the transfer by Disney.

I'm hoping that Disney will be reissuing this terrific movie because it certainly deserved it. Unfortunately, the film with its loopy charm and srong performances didn't get the audience it deserved and died at the box office. Disney, get off your duff and reissue this as a two DVD Special Edition as it deserves!",1135987200,108,2849,4.819672131147541
454892,5,6302269431,"My husband's an airplane buff and I'm a retro fan, so there was much to please in this fun and exciting Disney entry about a 1930s racing pilot and his older mentor who find a stolen rocket pack hidden in their old airplane. Turns out our hero Cliff Secord is just the guy to fly the rocket pack (invented by airplane mogul Howard Hughes)--but when the thieves return to claim it, Cliff's beautiful girlfriend, aspiring actress Jenny Blake, is endangered. The 1930s look is captured perfectly, from the interior of a fancy nightclub to the homely hominess of the local pilots' hangout, a bulldog-shaped diner. Timothy Dalton, as the swashbuckling (and sinister) Neville Sinclair is a super villain. My personal favorite of all the characters is Peevy, Cliff's mentor, played with appropriate irascibility by Alan Arkin.

The original DVD release was quite dreadful, with artifacting and other visual problems, so this new Blu-Ray ""Anniversary Edition"" is a welcome addition. Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is the picture and sound are both beautiful. The blacks are black, the colors are vivid. I still detected what I thought were a few minor specs of ""dirt,"" and there is a bit of graininess in certain scenes, such as the one where Jenny is dancing with Sinclair at the South Seas Club. The sound is deep and rich, showing off the theme music to wonderful advantage. It's quite beautiful. (And compared to the original DVD release, it's like choirs of angels singing!) The simple menus are a cute retro metallic based on the Rocketeer helmet.

The bad news is that this ""Anniversary Edition"" has not one extra except for the theatrical trailer. No commentary, no ""Making Of,"" no nothing. Disney certainly has the ""Making Of"" special...I watched it! Again, they've gone cheap on something that doesn't fit the ""new"" Disney that consists of cheaply animated kids' series. Isn't one of the delights of Blu-Ray that you can place so much extra information on the disk? Incomprehensibly, there is even an ""info"" choice on the ""bonus features"" menu that has a disclaimer about commentary and extras!!!

Not to mention that the menu is persnickety as the dickens; I had to go back to the beginning of the DVD about three times to get out of submenus because I kept getting the message ""This operation prohibited.""

The only good thing about the paltry extras is that we don't have to suffer through the seeming hundreds of ""commercials"" Disney stuffs on its other disks. This pretty much goes directly to the main menu.

I love this film, so I gave it five stars. However, the ""anniversary release"" treatment gives Disney a big fat ONE star. Phooey.",1135123200,5,2666,4.863436123348017
454893,5,6302269431,"Walt Disney's ""The Rocketeer,"" based on the graphic novel by Dave Stevens, is a very well-made action-packed thriller. Featuring then-little-known Jennifer Connelly (who made her film debut as a cute little girl in Sergio ""The Man With No Name Trilogy"" Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In America"") and two-time James Bond Timothy Dalton (""The Living Daylights"" and ""Licence To Kill;"" see my review on them), the film centers on out-of-work pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) trying to handle his woes and his actress girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) when all of a sudden, his life takes a startling turn. That's all the plot detail you'll get from me. The performances in this film are excellent, from Campbell as the titular character, the always beautiful and reliable Jennifer Connelly and Timothy Dalton. Great score too.

Walt Disney Pictures knows how to make a good action movie for kids and adults, as the violence is enough to keep adults interested and at the same time, non-graphic for the kids. However, I HAVE to say something, with profound apologies to Walt Disney Pictures if I offend them in any way, as I completely enjoy their movies. One part of a scene had me thinking ""This is starting to look a bit like a porn movie,"" though I knew that Disney wouldn't even attempt something so outrageous, which would tarnish their family-friendly image, so firmly established by Walt Disney himself almost 100 years ago. I can handle it, but just thought I'd point this out, in case young kids are interested in seeing this action-adventure film. Rated PG for some violence and mild language.",1122681600,3,1594,4.947761194029851
454894,4,6302269431,"""The Rocketeer"", Disney's 1991 adventure film based on the successful comic book by Dave Stevens, is tons of fun. In spirit and execution, it resembles the 1999 Universal film ""The Mummy"". Both movies have a 1930s sensibility (perhaps because both are set in that era) with regard to pacing, action scenes, and cinemetography.

There are no shades of grey here. The villains (Nazis) are pure evil, and the heroes are purely good. Jennifer Connelly and Bill Campbell shine as the ""good guys"", and Timothy Dalton turns in a devilish performance as the turncoat actor Neville Sinclair.

The only downside to this family-suitable adventure is the paucity of scenes featuring Campbell in the ""Rocketeer"" costume and backpack. With its huge budget, you'd think Disney could have squeezed in some extra eye-popping footage of the titular character in action. But be assured, when he does appear, and the action begins to heat up, you will be on the edge of your seat, reaching for the popcorn.",1110931200,6,986,5.0060975609756095
454895,5,6302269431,"""The Rocketeer"" is a wonderfully nostalgic gem of a movie that giddily embodies the spirit of Old-Hollywood adventure.  Unfortunately, its charms were completely lost on this jaded generation.  It wasn't a big box office success and thus squashed the producer's hopes of turning ""The Rocketeer"" into an ongoing series, something that I will forever be upset by.

Set in 1934 Los Angeles, director Joe Johnston (""Jumanji"", ""Jurassic Park III"", ""Hidalgo"") has created a truly flawless, old-fashioned adventure.  Our hero is Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell), a flying ace who comes into possession of a stolen rocket pack designed by Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn).  They don't know where it came from, but they soon find out that both the feds and the mob are looking for it and are willing to kill for it. While they decide what they are going to do with it, Cliff is forced to use it to rescue a pilot in trouble during an airshow. He straps on the jetpack and a helmet designed by his friend Peevy (Alan Arkin) which not only protects him, but serves as a handy superhero-identity-concealer.

Cliff barely manages to rescue the pilot, while hundreds of awe-struck spectators cheer him on.  He quickly makes headlines, and tinsel town is aquiver with rumors of ""The Rocketeer"". Everyone knows about him, except for his girlfriend Jenny (Jennifer Connelly). When he tells her ""I have a secret. I'm the Rocketeer!"" she confusedly responds ""The Rock-a-who?""

The main villain who wants to get his hands on the rocket is handsome, charismatic film star Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton), an obvious parody of Errol Flynn.  This parody of Flynn and the film's ability to tie together many aspects of 1930's-40's pop-culture is its greatest strength.  Drawing heavily on Hollywood icons, then-contemporary world events, and on aviation history, you'll find yourself completely immersed in this 1930's world and wishing you could've lived then.",1108944000,19,1932,5.124203821656051
454896,4,6302269431,"Great adventure movie with ample comedic flourishes has title character squaring off against Nazi scumbags in the World War II era.  With a high-caliber performance with great subtle comedic timing by Bill Campbell, a shining performance by Jennifer Connelly as the Rocketeer's actress-girlfriend, and a great showing by Timothy Dalton as the lead villain, at turns charismatic and sinister, and thrilling aerial sequences.  Kudos to the effects and cinematography teams.  Title character is a tad on the cocky side for my liking but within acceptable limits; a good thing since I've long tired of action movies where the brash jerk of a 'hero' ends up with mega-babe with the heart of gold, a role Connelly certainly plays well here.  Still, what Jennifer fanboy can help but feel just a twinge of jealousy when her character ends up with any of the lead male characters in her movies?  Ah, the price of being constantly enamored with on-screen lovelies.  Honestly though, this is a great film, recommended both to fans of action-comedies like ""Back To The Future"", ""True Lies"", and ""The Fifth Element"" as well as fans of more serious adventure-exhilirators like ""Spider-Man, ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Speed"".

454912,4,6302269431,"Back in the 1930s the pulp magazine character Buck Rogers made the leap to the comic strips and carried his popular ""rocket pack"" with him. It wasn't used in the Universal Serial, nor in the later t.v. series of the 1980s, but the rocket pack was a fan favorite and got ""lifted"" by several other entrepreneurs for use in their own high adventure efforts.
  Most notably, it was lifted by Republic Pictures for use in its 1949 serial ""King of the Rocketmen"". Proving popular there, it was recycled into a flying device for the character ""Commando Cody"" (not ""Commander"" Cody, as many people erroneously believe) in the chapterplay ""Radar Men From the Moon"",on then into ""Zombies of the Stratosphere""(with young Leonard Nimoy as an alien baddie) and, lastly, into the tv series ""Commando Cody"" with Judd Holdren. The famous rocket back pack ,strapped to a hip-length leather jacket and complemented by the metallic, bullet-shaped helmet of the wearer, became a staple of 50s adventurism.
  Years later artist Dave Stevens wanted to do a comic book version of the Rocketman/Commando Cody character but Republic wouldn't license it...so Stevens revamped the entire concept and created the Rocketeer instead. Threw in ""Bondage Bettie"" Page for eye candy (and perilous predicaments), and had himself a winner.
  When Disney decided to do the Rocketeer as a live action ""pilot"" for a proposed series, they made a good decision. They just didn't market it correctly and made too abrupt a decision not to continue with it.
  This is a good movie. It could have been better, but it is good nonetheless. My complaints about it are twofold storywise; one, I think they should have left ""Bettie"" alone and played an inside joke with the audience. They should have had her elaborately TIED UP at some point. The kiddies wouldn't have gotten the joke, but the more ""culturally informed"" would have gotten a snicker out of it. Secondly, they went with Charles Higham's thoroughly discredited ""Errol Flynn was a Nazi spy"" humbug and, in so doing, helped continue this unjustified smear. Even calling him ""Neville Sinclair"" didn't disguise the allusion of the portrayal, nor did Tim Dalton's oh-so-Flynn-like make up job.
  Those points aside, this IS a captivating little adventure. The flying scenes are great, and the zeppelin climax is a real winner...as is the cool idea of a Rondo ""Creeper"" Hatton ""goon"" achieved via SFX makeup.
  This digital transfer is NOT that great, but maybe it'll be re-done sometime in the future. Lets hope so. In the meantime, we have what we have. The movie itself is well worth watching. Enjoyable and endearing. Go with it.",1068422400,4,2642,4.9795454545454545

Perhaps most people were too jaded to be sucked into the film's retro-optimism. Johnston and company really captured the vibe of the old pulp serials so well in this film -- the attention to detail is fantastic.
The leads are appealing and charismatic. There is a real chemistry between Bill Campbell and Jennifer Connelly -- they were a couple in real life at the time, which I'm sure didn't hurt.
As far as comic book adaptations go, The Rocketeer is quite faithful to its source material with the notable exception of the Disney-fication of Connelly's character which is understandable. Her more Betty Page-esque comic book counterpart might have given the film a problem securing a PG rating. No matter, this is a fine adaptation and one only hopes that Disney will replace this bare bones DVD with a lavish special edition as they have done with both Tron and 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.",1058832000,5,1064,4.883977900552487

The movie also does a good job of capturing the feel of old movie serials and pulp magazines, both of which I am a fan.  Jennifer Connolly is stunning in what I consider her first ""adult"" role.
The supporting cast is great.  Alan Arkin plays a bumbling scientist type, right out of old movies.  Timothy Dalton is fun as the smug, slimy Hollywood star, Paul Sorvino is perfect as a 30's gangster, and Terry O'Quinn, one of the great character actors of modern day, is wonderful as Howard Hughes.

454940,5,6302269431,"Oh yeah! I love, love, LOOOOVVVE this film!! The Rocketeer in my opinion was THE best film of 1991 (time sure flies, pardon the pun)! Based on the old comic book series by reknowned girlie pinup artist/graphic designer/comic artist, Dave Stevens, the Rocketeer was loosely inspired by the old Commander Cody TV series. The plot revolves around a dashing young stunt pilot down on his luck who happens to stumble upon a stolen experimental portable rocket pack that can be worn on the back allowing the wearer to fly. He now thinks that Lady Luck may have smiled on him at last. But unknownst to him, a whole bunch of other folks want the rocket pack as well including the Nazis and the mob! Now the chase really begins! The story is a rip roaring, rocket propelled adventure involving everything from international espionage, Howard Hughes, to Golden Age Hollywood. Tongue in the cheek, fast, and fun from beginning to end with a wonderfully rousing score, fantastic special effects, and action sequences that will take your breath away!!! This film is just WOW!!!
It should be noted that the love interest/heroine - Jenny, played by Jennifer Connelly was originally based on 50's pinup queen Bettie Page in the comics, but for copyright reasons was altered both in name and physical appearance for this movie.
Unfortunately, despite the rave reviews and enthusiastic audience response when the Rocketeer was first released, it was somewhat left behind in the dust by then summer juggernaught, Terminator 2, and largely neglected (earning a respectable but unimpressive $60 million, while the film costed $40 million). Sigh, there is truly no justice in the world. The producers later admitted to marketing the film wrong (it was a film for everyone, and not a Disney-ish kiddie movie), and not enough movie goers were lured in as a result.

Disney bought the old theatre and spent about 10 million dollars refurbishing it. It is a beautiful theatre and contains the original fixtures and dcor  - newly repainted - and the most sophisticated digital and THX movie theatre systems around.
Now, that aside, the film was a fantasy filled adventure set in the not so distant past (30's - 40's) about a secret device invented by Mr. Howard Hughes himself which was stolen by some gangster with the intentions of steeling it Hitler himself.

Based on a comic book with classic retro styling, it about a regular guy who is burdened with an extraordinary piece of equipment that gives him the ability to fly.  Luckily he's a pilot.  The story is solid, if not clichd.  In the late 1930's, a young pilot who is a winning hopeful for a plane race gets his hopes shot down when his plane is damaged.  He and his top mechanic stumble on a jetpack.  From there, things get going.  Everyone seems to want this thing.  The pilot soon finds himself, as well as everyone around him, in danger.  Throw in The Nazis, a charming but snake like actor/villain, a large speechless bruiser, the mob and Howard Hughes (not the real man, just an actor playing him) and you have a busy movie that keeps a pace and riddles you with adventure.  Joe Johnson is a great director, recently doing the 3rd Jurassic Park movie and making it a hit as well.  His handling of this movie is well balanced.

No one knows why it never made it, but everyone who watches it has to admit one thing; it sure is entertaining.
The Rocketeer had state-of-the-art effects for its time, and if you aren't too cynical, you can still enjoy them. This is a rollicking, Indiana Jones-esque adventure with the requisite Nazis, feds, and damsel in distress. The performances are quite well done, especially with Alan Arkin as an engineer and Paul Sorvino as a patriotic mobster. Both of these fine actors give so much charisma in their performances that they steal every scene they're in. Connelly and Campbell are fine giving their lines, and Timothy Dalton is very slick and evil as Neville Sinclair, which is truly the best madeup name for a Hollywood actor that I've ever heard of.
Joe Johnston has always been a very visual director who uses special effects to his advantage, and he doesn't dissapoint with this movie. The comedy of some situations is held up just right and works very well with the incredible pyrotechnics. Even though there really aren't any camera angles that we haven't seen yet, Johnston still has enough of a mind to keep the pacing up and work the camera to his and his stars advantages.

Some of the best are Paul Sorvino as gangster Eddie Valentine, Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes, and Tiny Ron as Lothar.  The musical score by James Horner is outstanding.  It's heroic, quiet and inspiring.  Why this film didn't turn out to be the big blockbuster it should have been is beyond me.

There is no winking at the camera as in the Indiana Jones movies (which I also like very much) -- this is straight, square-jawed Boy Scout hero fights sneaky villians, with the help of beautiful, plucky girlfriend and mechanical genius sidekick/father-figure. It is an excellent family movie.
The movie has some nice movie-buff jokes, which I enjoyed (the character from ""The Pearl of Death"" was a lot of fun), and loving attention is paid by the set-designers to details of the thirties in Southern California (as far as I can tell from old photos and talking to natives of the area) and to the aviation industry of the time (according to my father, who was and is a buff starting during that period). In any event the movie looks great and feels ""authentic"".
I don't understand why this movie was such a flop -- I can see that it wasn't going to make the imact of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it should have done well enough to rate a sequel. However, the movie trailer on the DVD convinced me that the marketing people at Disney failed to advertise the movie correctly, and I certainly remember being surprised (although pleasantly) when I saw it in a theater.",981331200,7,1398,4.529644268774703
454962,4,6302269431,"This is the sort of film for which the superlatives ""golly gee!"" and ""gosh, wow!"" apply quite nicely.  If you've ever wondered what those 1930s serials about heroes and damsels in distress and cackling bad guys were like that your grandfolks enjoyed so many years ago, this film offers a great facimile of those addictive serials!  ""The Rocketeer"" has that quality of whiz-bang action and whooshing excitement that makes serials so much fun.
In fact, this film is based upon a comic book novel that was a tribute to those serials.  As a result, the plot line has a familiar ring to it - our handsome hero (Campbell) and his sweet and lovely main squeeze (the ever-easy-on-the-eyes Jennifer Connelly) run into trouble after the hero discovers a stolen prototype jet-pack circa 1938.  Our hero dons the jet-pack and voila, he becomes The Rocketeer!  Unfortunately, the mob is after him and the feds are after him.  Everyone wants that jet-pack!  Along the way, there are ugly mean henchmen, rat-a-tat-tat machine gun fights, a great rocketman rescue in the air, swooning heroines, and fun swash-buckling sword-fights (yes!).  Wait, there's more!  There are great exploding blimp-airships and bang-up car chases and funky Howard Hugh prototype airplanes.  And where would we be in a 1930ish film without a few rascally nazis?
So, what more could you ask for?  Cheer for the hero and hiss at the villains!  This film has that same ""golly gee"" sense of yesteryear fun that the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" had.  Sure, it's all light, fluffy stuff, but it's good clean fun for the entire family!  A few words about the DVD, which I bought.  This is one of Disney's early DVDs.  Unfortunately, Disney's early DVDs usually had non-anamorphic transfers, expensive prices, nonexistent extras, and just so-so picture quality.  This DVD has those problems; the picture quality at times shows edge enhancement or shimmering.  And the dark scenes have a fuzzy, muddy appearance to them.  Sound quality is average but booms at the appropriate times in the movie.  I just wish Disney had spent more time on a better video transfer.  But still, it's a fun film!  I rate this film four stars, but just keep in mind that the DVD version is not up to par with Disney's later DVDs.",971222400,7,2266,4.861618798955614

454995,5,6302269431,"Dave Stevens' classicly-styled, 1930's comic book character comes to life in one of the most under-rated motion pictures of the 1990's.  Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) dons the dangerous prototype rocket pack (built by Howard  Hughes in the movie; the classic pulp superhero Doc Savage did it in the  comics) to stop the Nazis'(lead by Timothy Dalton) evil plans and save his  beautiful girlfriend Betty (Jenniffer Connelly) from danger.
This movie  successfully captures the escapism spirit of the Indiana Jones pictures.  Unfortunately, it's box office receipts weren't awesome so there won't be  any sequels.  That's too bad because this is a great story that has  something for the whole family.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone  who enjoys escaping from reality and entering a world where the bad guys  get what they deserve, the good guys ultimately win, and justice is  something that is worth FLYING for!",955670400,,918,5.163265306122449
454996,4,6302269431,"Disjointed thoughts: More like three and a half stars. The joy of this film is in the details. Too bad they couldn't have had the creator of the rocket pack be not Howard Hughes, but Doc Savage (as in the graphic novel  by Dave Stevens). The moment between the FBI agent and the gangster gets me  every time. Strangely, the scenes where the Rocketeer is flying are the  least entertaining of the movie, but I guess they were required. Good  picture quality, but often the sound would come out of the left speaker (of  my two-speaker system) when, e.g., a plane was on the right side of the  screen. As the plane zoomed off to the left, the sound went to the right. I  checked my cables and they're plugged in correctly, so it's confusing.",954979200,,738,4.4222222222222225

Much like the era in which it takes place, this movie makes you  feel like it stands for something good in us all. Acting, costumes and plot  are all comic book authentic.

454999,3,6302269431,"This film is just one average addition to the already gigantic collection of movies involving Nazi spies.  The plot is good, but sometimes difficult to believe.  As for the late-1930's atmosphere, it was quite successfully  recreated by using vintage airplanes and Cole Porter music.
The story  takes place in 1938, in Los Angeles.  The plot revolves around the search  for a portable rocket, an ultra-secret experiment (by no one else than  Howard Hughes) that could have military importance.  The FBI tries to get  it back, but the Nazi spies want to get their hands on it.  Pilot Cliff  Secord finds it but his life, and that of his girlfriend, are in danger as  a result of the discovery.
The main Nazi spy is, in the story, film actor  Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton, very good in the part), helped by  gangsters under the leadership of Eddie Valentine (who would eventually  turn against Sinclair when learning that the latter works for the  Nazis).
The film has a relatively interesting plot, but is however very  stereotypical, starting with the character of Neville Sinclair.  Maybe I'm  wrong here, but why was he named Neville ?  Does it have anything to do  with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, famous for his waving of a  paper signed by Hitler after his return from the Munich conference in  September 1938 ?  And on which actor (if any) is Sinclair's character based  ?  On Clark Gable (whom Sinclair briefly encounters at the restaurant) ?  On Douglas Fairbanks (for the type of films Sinclair plays in) ?  I would  personally say Errol Flynn, who has been accused by one author of being a  Nazi sympathizer and a spy (see ""Errol Flynn: the Untold Story"",  by Charles Higham, who actually does not prove anything in his very bad  book).  Furthermore, Flynn's most famous film, ""The Adventures of  Robin Hood"", closely resembles the film Neville Sinclair is starring  in (a swashbuckling movie), and was released in... 1938!
As for the  exploding airship, it is obvious that the inspiration came from the  ill-fated Hindenburg, which exploded in 1937.  The Hindenburg, however,  exploded over New Jersey, not California.
One of the most improbable  scenes in the entire film takes place just before the arrival of the  zeppelin, at the observatory.  When Valentine switches allegiances, dozens  of fully equipped Germans get out of the wood nearby and surround him.  Really, is it California or Germany ?
The film looks good while watching  it, but there is nothing left to remember it when the end credits are over.",950659200,2,2545,4.912529550827423
