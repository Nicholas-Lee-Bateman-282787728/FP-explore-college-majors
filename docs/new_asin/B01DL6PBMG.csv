All of the DVD's work, and I'd be fine with what I got for what I paid except for the online redeem code not being included.",1536192000,,263,3.981132075471698
8756332,3,B01DL6PBMG,"With a set like this, you know you're going to have to set the bar pretty low for some films.  Nevertheless, there are a decent number of actual good films, either hidden gems or made famous through notoriety.  Although you can't be too picky at this price, there are a few gripes I had with the set:

1.) Some of these transfers are direct captures from VHS.  I could take a commercial VHS film and do it myself and get better results.  Seriously, the video quality on some titles is atrocious.
2.) No subtitles.  Not a deal-breaker, but it would have been nice.
3.) The observation of correct aspect ratio is horrendous.  Almost everything is cropped to 1.33:1.  That means features like Warriors of the Wasteland, which was originally presented in the very cinematic 2.33:1,is now cropped down to a squareish shape that looks awful on a modern TV.  I blame the transfer process, though; if they're copying off of a VHS (which, in some cases, is totally obvious), it's not going to be anything but 1.33:1.  I'm very picky when it comes to aspect ratio, so this was by far the worst offense to both me and the source material.

Beyond that, you're going to have a hard time finding a better way to snap up real classics like Metropolis, or infamously bad titles like Reefer Madness or Manos: The Hands of Fate.  There's definitely enough good in there to justify the asking price, but be prepared to accept some pretty ham-fisted handling of the original films.",1535328000,,1462,4.624031007751938
8756333,5,B01DL6PBMG,"First of all, if anyone expects 50 movies with a quality of a current movie, you are shopping in the wrong area. If you want a pretty good collection of  movies that are at least watchable, some are better, this is a great set. You get movies for pennies each. I am well into my 60's and a lot of these are remembered from drive-ins, second movies in a double feature and television at very odd hours.
For what its worth, many of these movies are available on Prime Video for 2.95 each, I got 50 to keep and stream for about the price of watching three.
I have bought several of the Mill Creek collections, and have been more than satisfied, especially at the price point. I have about 2,000 movies that I have collected over the years and I truly wish I could have gotten them all at these prices, I would have saved lots of money!!

I had one problem, and that was with the  key code for streaming these movies (all 50 movies available for streaming included in the few dollars paid for the discs. I had a slight problem getting through the login process, including entering the keycode. I sent an email to Mill Creek Entertainment (late one night), and I received the help I needed early the next day.

Very happy with the purchase, and I will continue to supplement my collection with Mill Creek movie packs.",1535068800,,1312,4.386831275720165

8756336,2,B01DL6PBMG,It says that this movie pack was released in 2016. The quality on these DVDS says otherwise. It looks like they recorded the movies from the VHS tapes and sent them out to sell. This is such a disappointment.,1513728000,4,208,4.358974358974359

8756339,5,B01DL6PBMG,"It's Midnight, the witching hour, let the madness commence! This 50 movie set, another of many from Mill Creek/Tree Line, has mostly some good old fashioned drive-in fare. Just about all the drive-in movies are here. Again, more duplication on this set from other sets I already have, but this had more new ones than just a few so it was well worth it. So, roll down your car windows and insert the speaker on your car door and enjoy the movies from the heydays of old drive-in theatre. Have fun with this one movie addicts!",1499385600,4,524,4.46875
