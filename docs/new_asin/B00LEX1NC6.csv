8665505,2,B00LEX1NC6,"Terrible format and the puppets were poorly done. My kiddos aren't retaining anything. I wish ""preschool prep"" would do a math series",1445472000,,133,5.090909090909091
8665506,2,B00LEX1NC6,"The opening segment of this video is only music and sound effects. The vocal tracks are missing. The puppets are talking but you can't hear them. The rest of the video is fine. It is a good basic introduction to subtraction, and the puppets are funny. I do wish we could hear the antics at the beginning though.",1429833600,,311,4.379310344827586
8665507,5,B00LEX1NC6,"TLT is not as fancy as some educational movies, but it will not waste your child's time.  The ""teacher,"" Shelly is sweet and engaging.  My daughters enjoy her fun lessons, and they really learn.  Other math movies seem fun, but I notice they take much more time, and my daughters do not learn as much.  I use this as an adjunct to my home schooling.",1425945600,,349,4.323076923076923
