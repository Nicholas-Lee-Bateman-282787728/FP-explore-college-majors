4190054,5,B003T0PMB0,"I have been doing prenatal yoga at home during my pregnancy, but when i got this dvd and did it along my husband, it was a totally wonderful experience. It added a fun element to do yoga with someone and exercises in this dvd are very good.",1309132800,,240,4.127659574468085
8404912,1,B003T0PMB0,"Most of the positions seem very unsafe for a pregnant women. This is clearly not for beginners. They say its ok if you tumble over since when is it ok for a pregnant woman to fall over!? Bought this thinking there would be lots of partner positions but there were only a few that involved a partner, very silly and could easily be found on YouTube. The video includes a mother to be massage instruction, but based on the positions they wanted pregnant women to get into like tabletop I do not trust that the advice given would not be harmful.",1526947200,,542,4.376237623762377
8404913,5,B003T0PMB0,"Awesome. I accidentally returned it instead of a lame prenatal yoga video, but I'll probably buy again next pregnancy. My hubby joined me, much to his chagrin at first, but then he liked it a lot. He was happy to be able to help me feel better (deepening stretches and massaging and such. Stuff he learned here helped during labor)",1454976000,,331,4.533333333333333
8404914,1,B003T0PMB0,Dumb. I love yoga but this was a waste of time. Do not buy,1442275200,,58,3.2142857142857144
8404915,1,B003T0PMB0,As a yoga teacher that specializes in Prenatal yoga I would not recommended this video. It is obvious that the husband who is the yoga teacher in this video has not been trained in prenatal yoga and that he is just doing this to promote the baby food company that his wife owns.,1427068800,,278,4.264150943396227
8404916,4,B003T0PMB0,"Easy enough to do by virtually anybody with basic level of strength. I liked that it wasn't intimidating for my partner, who wanted to support me in my exercise routine and is more of the-most-lovable-geek-on-Earth (rather than yogi :) ).",1397347200,,238,4.975
8404917,3,B003T0PMB0,"The pace of the yoga routine is a little choppy, fast, and awkward for beginners. Good for more advance yoga practice?",1391472000,,118,4.666666666666667
8404918,5,B003T0PMB0,A nice 40 minute yoga flow for preggo and partner to complete. We truly enjoyed this - a great way to connect and get some exercise and relaxation all in one. The yoga teacher and his pregnant wife who are the focus of the video are likeable and make the instructions easy to follow. Money well spent.,1366416000,,301,4.298245614035087
8404919,5,B003T0PMB0,"great stretching exercises, easy to do. relaxing and fun 45 min session.  Easy to follow instruction. Great for first time yoga.",1350691200,,128,5.095238095238095
8404920,4,B003T0PMB0,"I purchased this DVD because my husband wanted to try yoga with me and pre-natal yoga at our gym is only for moms-to-be.  I have been practicing yoga and Pilates for several years and my husband is fairly fit and coordinated, so we were able to catch on pretty quickly.  We found Joe and Shazi relatively easy to follow, and so we both could both focus on stretching, breathing, and connecting.  We even shared a few laughs. We felt both relaxed and invigorated at the end-- this will not leave you exhausted, sweaty, or sore, but i don't think most pregnant women are looking for a high-intensity workout. My only complaint is relatively minor- I would have appreciated more camera angles so that I could get a closer look at some of the modifications that Shazi did to accommodate her body.",1325548800,,792,4.602836879432624
8404921,5,B003T0PMB0,"I love it! I definitely recommend. I started doing this at 7 1/2 months and wish I would have had it since the beginning! If you haven't been doing yoga during your whole pregnancy I suggest startin' out slow. It whooped mine and my husband's butt! It feels awesome, though. Good stuff.",1321574400,,286,4.519230769230769
