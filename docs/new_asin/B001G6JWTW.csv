8304101,3,B001G6JWTW,"A sweet Indy film that never made the big time. Entertaining, but not great. Rosanna Arquette plays a serious, non-crazy character for once and does it well. Worth watching.",1302393600,,173,5.0
8304102,3,B001G6JWTW,a suicidal guy falls for an even more suicidal girl . it's a dark comedy . Natasha lyonne character is sweet cute and innocent....well not really innocent. this movie was too cute and happy for the storyline . the ending should have been different so that there could have been  more emphasis on the fact that he  would still have decided to live with or without her  . i wasn't happy with the ending.  If u want a bubbly romantic movie thats unique and has a happy ever after ending then this is  the movie for you . If not ...then at least it has Natasha lyonne in it . mpfh this movies  too cute for my taste .I give it 3 stars becuz it has Natasha lyonne in it and becuz it's different,1299974400,,689,4.104477611940299
