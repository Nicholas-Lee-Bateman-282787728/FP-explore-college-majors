6498499,4,B00LPJ3J6W,"I was worried when I bought Season Five Voyage Six that I'd have to wait a year and a half for Season Six to arrive (just like I did between the end of Season Three and the beginning of Season Four).  Thank goodness I only have to wait half as long.  Anyway, in this volume we meet Brook, the jolly singing skeleton who's keeps asking Nami to see her panties.  Ever since the beginning, Luffy's wanted a musician to join his crew and Brook is overjoyed by Luffy's invitation.  There is only one slight problem, someone has stolen Brook's shadow and Brook cannot go into the sunlight or he will die.  Which prompts Luffy, of course, to search for the shadow thief and get Brook's shadow back.

Unfortunately, the shadow thief is Gecko Moria, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.  He has already amassed a army of a thousand shadow powered zombies and is nearly ready to make another go at conquering the New World and becoming the King of the Pirates (Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, defeated Moria the first time).  Moria is assisted by Dr. Hogback (who supplies the corpses for creating zombies), Absalom (a lion headed man who can turn himself and anything he touches invisible), and Perona (a doll-like woman who can create ghosts to help her in battle).  Moria needs just one more shadow to power his biggest, mightiest zombie, Oars.  As the Straw Hat Pirates approach Thriller Bark Island to recover Brook's shadow, they don't suspect in the least that they are falling into Moria's trap, and that Moria has chosen Luffy's shadow to power Oars!",1405641600,3,1552,4.610909090909091
