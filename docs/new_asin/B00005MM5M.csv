7945825,2,B00005MM5M,"The film opens as a mystery as we see a group of women care for another and a man abducts people looking for what appears to be his daughter and then killing the victim.. We discover in this low budget film, the women have a disease/ affliction which causes them to have to eat human flesh and organs to survive. They buy organs and feed off of Johns. That is pretty much it.

The film appears to be a statement about life in general, in how we all must feed off of ""dead creatures"" in order to survive, especially people who eat meat. It asks the question, ""What's the point?"" if everything dies so something else can live. It makes it a little more personal when one has to eat human flesh and do their own killing.

The film itself consisted of the most boring reluctant cannibals ever assembled.

7945826,1,B00005MM5M,This movie sux's it looks terrible and doesn't play in my dvd player. Also they got the director mixed up...it's suppose to be by Fangoria!!!,1305936000,,141,4.68
7945827,2,B00005MM5M,"When faced with a disease which wastes the body while compelling the victim to eat human flesh, a group of afflicted women huddle together to survive. DEAD CREATURES provides viewers with an alternative to the usual Zombie fare, in that the ""Zombies"" appear more or less like normal people accept that they crave human flesh. Yep, they even talk...a lot. I personally don't care for talking Zombies as they are not as threatening or dare I say, ""realistic"". The horror element is diminished when Zombies babble. Despite the claims of the director, these are not really Zombies as they are NOT the undead, rather, they are living people with an odd disease which is transmitted by the bite of an infected person. As implied in the film, those afflicted will eventually die unless they are put down by their support group. These are not rage type Zombies, nor are they Romero Shamblers or Snyder Runners. Where the disease has been allowed to run its course, we do have a fair to good looking stage 3 Zombie, though they are too weak to hunt humans, (darn). In the special features the Director stated that he aimed this film at those who were tired of comedic horror, adding that he wished to provide an alternative to the Zombie film. On that count he succeeded, however, DEAD CREATURES is actually a rather ponderous, tedious film, though occasionally punctuated by some decent gore. This is basically a dialogue driven picture where the women spend most of their time sitting around their apartment talking and smoking pot. What kill scenes there are remain unconvincing and devoid of any style or slaughter appeal. The few gore scenes presented are well done, accept that what the women ate would not have fed a church mouse. The actors required some strident direction here, but alas such was not the case. Although originally slotted for a micro budget, DEAD CREATURES was made for a paltry $70,000.00, and unfortunately it shows. As I have stated before, what Zombie fans want most of all is CARNAGE. End of story. This ain't Shakespeare. Most fans don't care about social messages in these type of films, (unless they are artsy fartsy types). If you want that, then watch PONTYPOOL, (oops! I mean PONTYPOO). Why film makers overtly strive for sending us a social message in a Zombie film is beyond me. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear people. This film has a number of social messages, but I could care less to discuss them. The fact that our loved ones come after us when dead should be creepy enough. Competent direction should draw the viewer in, which would seriously add to the creep factor. Unfortunately, this rarely happens in the modern Horror film. I will give the Director credit for attempting something different while avoiding the dreaded horror comedy route. Spot on! I also enjoyed the gore that was presented, however, there is no escaping the fact that this is a boring movie with minimal Zombie chow time. I really wanted to like this film, however, this is a marginal outing at best. Recommended for the ""Zombie"" completest.",1239235200,,3065,4.784905660377358
7945828,2,B00005MM5M,"Several plain/plump looking women live together in an appartment. They talk a bit then go out, kill someone bring them home and butcher the body.

They're compelled to survive on human flesh. They don't even get it on with each other, or their prey.

And there's a sub-plot about some nut who captures creatures such as themselves and then tortures and kills them.

Very little else happens in this film. Unless the 'everydayness' of this horror is meant to make some point, it's rather boring.",1158105600,,494,4.788235294117647
7945829,4,B00005MM5M,"My wife summed it up like this: ""It was unpredictable and realistic...it seemed like it could happen...it was so cerebral!""

She's right.  This is a cool not-your-typical zombie flick. For one thing, our heroines aren't zombies.  They have, apparently, contracted a disease that drives them to eat human flesh.

And eat human flesh, they do!  This is one of the goriest movies I've seen in a long time... and done much more realistically than most zombie movies.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE NotLD and ALL ROMERO'S CHILDREN!  This movie is just different... and worth your time.

The plot is basically this: Two different groups of women are hiding out, suffering with this disease that they contracted when they were bitten by other victims.  The disease forces them to eat human flesh.  Are they zombies?  One of the actresses in the extras says that they are.  I didn't think so.  But they are, I suppose, THINKING zombies.

The actresses are great, btw.",1132444800,6,956,4.820987654320987
7945830,5,B00005MM5M,"Just when you thought it was safe to go into the video shop someone comes up with Dead Creatures.  You'll get no synopsis from me, but lets say this slow burning slice of life at the coal face of zombiedom is pretty radical in that it doesnt rely on the well worn cliches we all know and love, but strikes out in a new direction.
A worthy addition to the 'not a normal horror film' genre.",1026777600,2,388,4.105263157894737
