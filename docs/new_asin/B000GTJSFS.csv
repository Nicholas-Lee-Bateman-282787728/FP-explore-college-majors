2617505,5,B000GTJSFS,"This series is brilliant.  The special effects are truly impressive, the style (made like a fake nature documentary, as if the filmmakers are just observing the dinosaurs in the wilds) is clever, and it's all just fascinating.  Some of it is quite graphic with dinosaurs battling each other, eating each other and dying off in lots of different ways, so I was worried that my almost-four-year-old wasn't ready for it.  But he's started to ask questions about dying and animals eating each other and this has actually been a nice segueway into those discussions.  We've especially enjoyed the ""making of"" featurette - lots of information there well beyond how they acheived the special effects.",1184716800,71,693,5.052631578947368

2617534,5,B000GTJSFS,I bought this for my grandson who is 3 1/2 and dinosaur grazy.  I am told it is a bit gory.  His 12 year old sister refused to continue watching it when the dinosaurs ate the babies but he is very happy to watch it time after time and he understands that it is not nice to eat babies!,1487030400,,284,3.7966101694915255

Details that could have been known only to someone that witnessed these fake creatures alive yesterday.

Since this new release scrupulously avoids revealing who the narrator is I have to assume we are stuck with Branagh again.  Buyers need to insist that the Discovery version be released for our market and Branagh needs to be a stand-up guy and release whatever legal stranglehold he may have on the project so we can all enjoy this splendid program at its fullest potential. UK viewers may have no idea how bad the Branagh narration is until they hear the Brooks version, which I suspect Branagh doesn't want to happen...",1387756800,10,1005,5.121951219512195

The animation and puppetry are good to excellent, the interactions between the creatures, ie. plot, is well done and compelling and Kenneth Branagh is very good as the narrator. However the filmakers made this series as though it was a typical nature film in which we observe animal behavior and the narrator fills us in on the action. The only problem is that these animals died out over 65 million years ago and we don't know a lot about how they behaved or interacted. So assertions that diplodicus raised himself briefly on his hind legs to attract a mate or that they used their tales for communication, or that pterosaurs had certain mating rituals etc. is based solely on speculation and extrapolation of current, living species behavior. Most of the claimed dinosaur behaviors are without any factual basis. In other words, the filmakers made it up.

Now that I look back on this, I find it is still quite good; the writing is superb, the story is excellent, the narration is beautiful, the CGI is shaky occasionally, but it isn't always used. Instead, rubber puppets are implemented for close up shots (I miss the days when clever camera tricks and rubber puppets were used instead of CGI).
The series plays out as a documentary on dinosaurs as taken from the view of someone filming in the actual time period. Think ""planet earth"" but with dinosaurs, each episode focusing on one/two/three individual(s)/group(s) of dinosaurs and how they interact with the environment around them, how they eat, how they live, and occasionally, who eats them.
My own opinion of the product may be biased due to nostalgia, but I am willing to bet that, at least for a younger audience, one would reap much entertainment from this series.",1374796800,,1001,4.693181818181818

Ironically, the closeups were the most convincingan incredible amount of details in many cases. There are a few scenes that are slightly intense, but not too badprobably fine for most children. The philosophy, although disappointing, was exactly what we've come to expect from 'scientific' productions such as these. I would still recommend watching the series, but parents be on guard and help your children wade through the myriad of scientific fallacies and all the pseudo-science presented as fact, and all the other trappings that go along with the false premise of evolution which is aggressively promoted almost incessantly in this series.",1361836800,,900,5.129251700680272

2617807,5,B000GTJSFS,"Too often, we are bombarded with movies, mini-series, and documentaries that make us ashamed to call ourselves human beings.  Too often, we endure human activities and values that perversely champion hostility, stupidity, physical/moral decay, and hopelessness.  However, every once in a while, we witness a production whose ambition, scope, execution, and knowledge reminds and reassures us that human beings, when they exert themselves, can achieve near-miraculous things.  ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is certainly one of these stunning achievements.

  If you haven't treated yourself to this mind-boggling tour-de-force, I exhort you to do so without delay. With painstaking, exquisitely rendered CGI and animatronic wizardry, the BBC resurrects the most awe-inspiring, pivotal, senses-staggering menagerie of long-extinct creatures the earth will probably ever witness. I will not go into obsessive detail about the creatures, their environment, and their lifestyles.  I will say that the DVD contains six 30-minute episodes generally focusing upon a representative creature from the Jurassic era through the Cretaceous era.  I will also say that not all the creatures are strictly dinosaurs.  For example, you will witness a 3-foot mammal-like reptile called a cynodont (""dog tooth"") who co-existed in the Triassic with Coelophysis (""hollow form""), a skinny, bipedal precursor to the dinosaurs.  Also, you will witness the poignant final flight of an aging pterosaur, Ornithocheirus (""bird hand"") with a nearly 40-foot wingspread.  And as for ultimate marine monsters, the pliosaur Liopleurodon (""flat-sided tooth"") would give even T-Rex the willies.

  I feel a humble gratitude to the legion of artists, cameramen, paleontologists, directors, actors, and cinematographers for enduring all sorts of adversity to bring us this precious gem of a documentary, to attempt to show us how these magnificent beasts lived, fought, mated, and sadly expired.  More impressively, the BBC crew managed to convey the grandeur of these beasts without resorting to cheap melodrama or gratuitous violence.  Despite their often fearsome appearance, the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" beasts are not monsters, but creatures who simply do what they must to survive.  Even the narrator, Kenneth Branaugh, employs modulated, matter-of-fact tones to describe the proceedings.  I have seen this pseudo-documentary numerous times, and will continue to do so in the future.  To the members of this BBC production, I will simply say this - thank you for preserving my sometimes-faltering faith in mankind and its ultimately glorious achievements.

I'm a fan of discovery and national geographic Dino documentaries and seeing past efforts by bbc on other features, which turned out to be rather boring and drawn out. The bbc unexpectedly surprised me using nice real footage with very surprising graphics, considering the day, to bring to life these magnificent beasts of old. Accompanied by fascinating and large quantities of facts makes this a must own for dino enthusiasts or children learning what our world once looked like through the ages in which the dinosaur ruled....

They do not spend any amount of time dissecting them as other documentaries do, instead no fossils or x-rays..Just instinct and showing you how they lived day to day..This would be very nice for kids wanting to learn about dinosaurs without you parents having to worry about all the gore and ferocity of todays CGI",1326067200,,913,4.890322580645162

Most of the time in movies involving anamatronics and cgi theres generally a mess up where the puppet looks more realistic than the cgi, but not in this case. I prefer Walking With Dinosaurs to any half plotted cgi movies. The plot is amazing and while I would prefer not to see cute little dinos hurt and killed, its part of the cycle back then and if you want to take the full 'tour' then thats part of it.

2617817,5,B000GTJSFS,"`Walking With Dinosaurs' is the excellent 6 part documentary produced by the BBC that explores life as it may have been at the time of the Dinosaurs. This uses the same technology as was created for the making of the film `Jurassic Park' and although this utilises a lot of CGI and animatronic techniques this feels very much like a natural history series, but with Dinosaurs as the stars of the show. The only thing missing was David Attenborough narrating, but this job is ably carried out by Kenneth Branagh. The series looks at early Dinosaurs, the titans and huge Dinosaurs, sea based Dinosaurs, Flying Dinosaurs, Ice dwelling Dinosaurs and the large raptors and eventual demise of the species`. This has some good extras, with screen-in-screen features during the series and a second disc with a making of documentary. This manages to feel very real and as I mentioned, like a natural history film and by the end you almost feel as if you are watching actual animals that still exist to be filmed and studied. The series offers a fascinating insight into Dinosaurs, their development and evolution, diet, mating, migration and what is believed to be some of their behaviour. All in all this is a captivating series that can be enjoyed again and again.

The Tyrannosaurus is the last chapter, and very interesting and enlightening. The sea monsters are in an earlier chapter, with each chapter being a world in itself, since there are sometimes a million years spanning between them.

2617831,5,B000GTJSFS,"""Walking With Dinosaurs"" is a very well done account of the prehistoric beasts which have seared themselves into the American (and I assume the world's) cultural conscience.  The computer animation is generally very good and the stories unfold like a well told nature documentary.  Areas covered go from the rise of dinosaurs to their final years in the late Cretacious (spelling?).  Allosaurs and T-rex are amongst those shown.  Some other creatures range from small mammals to the massive marine predator Liploradon (spelling?) to giant amphibians in Antartica.  There is of course some gore involving predation so younger children may not want to watch it.  Anyway, on the whole, a very interesting documentary.",1217635200,,714,5.330357142857143
2617832,5,B000GTJSFS,"If you have children with an interest (or potential interest) in dinosaurs, buy this DVD set now!

I bought this DVD set several years ago as an afterthought and promptly forgot to take it out of the shrink wrap.  Two months ago I ran across it and decided that my children might be interested in watching it.  It quickly became their favorite DVD and now our house is full of dinosaurs.  On any given day, the plant eating dinosaurs are eating the leaves of the bushes and trees around our house.  The meat eaters are in combat with the plant eaters.  All of the dinosaurs are watching after their babies.

In addition to my children, both my wife and myself found the series to be fascinating.  The only drawback to the series for younger viewers is the violence.  The series did tone it down to the bare minimum.

In conclusion, I high recommend this DVD series to any dinosaur fan (or potential fan).  If you are a parent and would like to block all violence from your child, this series is probably a little too violent.  In that  case perhaps a book like ""Dinosaur Bones"" by Bob Banner might be a better choice (my children love watching the scholastic video version of that book).",1215907200,2,1187,4.490654205607477
2617833,5,B000GTJSFS,"Walking with Dinosaurs is a fast paced and never feel like you're going to fall asleep because you're bored series! It follows at least 4 different dinosaurus raning from the tiny cute little Liannaosaura { Spelling? } to the swift frightening Utah Raptor to even the gigantic Tyrannosarus. I bought this when I was 8 and I'm 15 and I still love it! There is no crappy animation, you really feel like your walking with the dinosaurs, as the title suggests. I would highly recommend this series to any fan of dinosaurs or a fan of entertainment.",1213142400,27,544,4.618556701030927
2617834,5,B000GTJSFS,"If you're looking for a visual, all-encompassing, overall understanding of the world of dinosaurs, then look no further, as you've just found one such a document. This video covers the whole era of the ""mighty lizards"" with a timeline spanning over hundreds of millions of years, from the Triassic up until 60 millions years ago with the sudden and massive extinction of this world of giant. It is amazingly punching, with very well rendered CGI scenes, both on the ground, under the sea and in the air. This documentary is both educative and entertaining. The Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Diplodocus, Plesiosaur, Ichthyosaur, (etc.) will have no more secrets once you finish viewing the DVD.

Major preys and predators of each era is covered graphically. Sequences are linked with one another in chronological order. Explanatory comments are clear, to the fact, based on scientific facts rather than on extrapolations, and are provided throughout the documentary to help understand the physical evolution of the flora and fauna of the world. Rationales, although sometimes tentative, are given about the reason why some species became extinct at times. Also, a special focus is given on the emergence of a very small, second tiers species, somewhat out of place is a world of ""giant lizards"": mammals. It is rather moving to see what we owe in today's world to such a ""negligible"" mammal ancestor.

It is also a fascinating testimony to the vanity of our civilization today, built on a few thousand years (taking the invention of writing as its start), when Dinosaurs roamed and ruled the world for HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of years.

British TV animal documentaries are renowned worldwide for their utmost qualities. They have no equivalent anywhere. This is yet another example of their unequaled superiority.",1212883200,17,1806,5.178082191780822
2617835,5,B000GTJSFS,"Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary as well as others in the series. The animation in these look so real you really feel like the animals are actually alive. I would caution that these programs are rather violent for young children. A good alternative would be the Prehistoric Planet set which is the same footage as Walking with Dinosuars, but reworked for children.",1209340800,,367,5.032786885245901

2617838,5,B000GTJSFS,"A lifelong dinosaur fan, I loved ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" from the moment it first came out. Watched it avidly every time it aired on cable. What's impressive is that years later and many watchings later, the illusions created by animatronics and puppetry seem as real and living as they were when I first saw these familiar animal stories.

The BBC went all out on the Walking With series, and realism is achieved in this fantastic set. The collection I bought includes Ballad of Big Al and Walking with Monsters, it's the Ultimate Dinosaur Collection and has much added material on the DVDs. More footage than airs when you watch it on cable got in.

I don't often buy DVDs, but I had to have this and it's as great after multiple watchings as it was the first thrilling time I saw it come up. There is a touring Walking with Dinosaurs show going worldwide now, live audiences can see the animatronic dinosaurs in person and get an impression of their scale, which I think is cool and I'm hoping to get to see it when it comes near my area in a couple of years.

One of the best things the BBC ever produced, and the quality holds true through all the Walking With documentaries.",1201046400,3,1181,4.4837209302325585
2617839,4,B000GTJSFS,"The first of the 'Walking With..' videos. There are a few rough edges, but overall it's an outstanding production. I use it to teach students about ecological interactions, pointing out that while the relationships in the video are purely speculative, the behaviors have all been observed with contemporary animals. It is enjoyable and a great icebreaker for dinosaur-mad kids.",1200614400,3,377,5.406779661016949

2617841,3,B000GTJSFS,"Having seen Jurassic Park over a decade ago, I was expecting better animation. It's definitely not the ""latest in computer animation"", more like a computer game and hand-puppet version of ""march of the penguin"" type storylines. I was often distracted by sloppy control of depth of field, sharpness, focus, and very obvious shifts from animation to hand puppets and back.

Most adults will probably be wanting more information than was given. For example in discussing archaeopteryx-like creatures, they glossed over some of the fascinating transitional aspects (long bony tail like a reptile, feathers like a bird, bony teeth and flexible spine like a reptile, hollow bones and (probably) warm blood of a bird). However, based on other reviews, this DVD seems very popular with children. So don't buy it expecting it to be as detailed as ""Life of Birds"" or similar documentaries.",1194566400,6,879,5.190140845070423

8134421,2,B000GTJSFS,"I am a total nature documentary nerd. I love dinosaurs. I watched more than my share of Marlin Perkins warning us all that nature can be cruel just before the antelope was brought down by the hungry lions.  But this.  30-minute episodes, and every 2-3 minutes was some horrible way for an animal to die. A nest of young dug up and consumed while the parents escape out into the night.  An entire herd burned up in a ""rare"" fire, with lingering shots of the roasted, smouldering carcasses in the aftermath. The ""old and weak"" member of the herd finally brought down by a nasty wound on her leg, with Kenneth Branagh's tepid narration over footage of her being eaten alive by the carnivore tracking the herd.  Young this-one being snatched, that old one dying on the way to the mating grounds, another lying dead after.  And all that's before you even get to the mass freezing-to-death extinctions. This is dinosaur violence porn.  I really wanted to see more about how they lived, not be dragged from one scene of carnage to the next.  Can't believe I watched the whole thing, hoping it would get better.  And honestly, I think my dislike had very little to do with how, even when narrating a dinosaur video, Kenneth Branagh makes me feel like he's really, really trying to let me know that it's Kenneth Branagh Master Thespian doing the voiceover.",1520640000,,1347,4.630252100840337
