8554596,4,B002PUKF4O,"The film expands on the seminal idea of a short story by Russian WW2 war correspondent Vasily Grossman, which is a single dialogue between a narrator and a female comissar, who found herself in the embarrassing situation of having to go for a ""maternity leave"" from her war duties. This famous picture moves the story itself back in time to the days of the Russian civil war that followed the October Revolution of 1917, and makes that single, slightly comic scene into a profound human drama between the heroine's perceived revolutionary duty and her true, human self.

One caveat: if you don't understand Russian well, you'll have to go for the subtitles. The English sound track is a bad joke (dialogues read out by a single speaker with bad English, while the original Russian is heard in the background). I haven't checked out the French and German ones yet, but I don't hope for anything better, because that is (or at least used to be) pretty much the standard Russian way of producing ""versions"" of films in languages other than its original.",1477958400,,1050,4.769230769230769
8554597,4,B002PUKF4O,"The story and characters are a bit thin; a female leader in the Russian
Revolutionary army in 1922 is disgraced when she is found to be
pregnant, and goes to live with a Jewish family, loses her hard shell
and becomes a mother.

But the black and white images are truly striking and impressive,
especially the fantasy sequences. They give the story a much deeper
power and resonance than it would otherwise have.

Especially impressive as a first film. this was suppressed by the
Moscow authorities for 20 years for it's sympathetic view of Jews and
their oppression in Russia, and the implication that the USSR was
complicit in knowing about, and not trying to stop the concentration
camps of WW 2.",1306713600,,699,4.721311475409836
