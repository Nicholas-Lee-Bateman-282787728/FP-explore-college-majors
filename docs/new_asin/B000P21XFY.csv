8217100,3,B000P21XFY,"For those who run into the DVD with the ""Volume 3"" tag by East West Video - it appears to be the same content reviewed previously (the 1981 ZIV dub), with the addition of an opening theme and looks to be combined from 2 or 3 episodes - first Harlock returns to earth to keep a promise to meet a little girl on her birthday, and escapes capture.  Then it seems to jump ahead an episode, ignoring where that one leaves off, going into one to two episodes of what could be ""Zeton Threat"" - they're trying to save Earth from an invasion of plant-based girls.  This ends with a semi-cliffhanger of them visiting a South American ruin after escaping an attack and the credits and end theme begin.  After about 20 seconds or so the picture jumps almost like someone changed a TV channel, into about six episodes of a short cartoon series - cartoons so incredibly low-budget that people's lips aren't animated, they're live action film blended with the animation, so they could use just two or three character head shots to make each scene.  I can't even remember the name but it was a 60s vintage Johnny Quest ripoff.  (I date it to the early 60s based on the race car and rocket designs in it).  They may be the ""public domain"" cartoons mentioned in the other review - I'd be embarassed to renew a copyright if I'd made them.

Ziv only dubbed four episodes (per Wikipedia) and if all four aren't included here I'm not sure why, but the lack of credits and open region are telling.  The picture quality isn't too terrible, but for a DVD it looks more like watching something recorded with a VCR.

It should also be noted the ""Volume 3"" can easily be purchased new very cheaply in discount outlets - I found my copy in a local ""all for a dollar"" type of store, not a chain but an independent store filling what had been an empty slot in the mall.

I gave it three stars only because I don't hate it - it's worth a look if you want to see what early anime/early US dubs looked like and the story isn't too bad even though the dialouge is goofy.  And for what I paid for mine it's hard to go wrong, it didn't cost much more than you'd pay per disc for blank media when buying like a 5-pack with cases.",1273017600,,2191,4.280871670702179
8217101,1,B000P21XFY,once again a episode of the infomous ZIV international dub of Capt harlock is re release this time to dvd.  be careful here you get 1 episode of harlock and a bunch of stuff that is public domain.  The episode has no opening theme (which if you've heard the ZIV theme this is actually a blessing) and the dialog is really bad  - but that isn't the fault of the dvd company it was horrid in 83 too.  If you have the FHE home vidoe releases or the malibu comics on VHS you have nothing new here and the transfer looks like it's from a very scratched 35mm.  depending on the video it might be called the Zeton threat or episode 4.,1222128000,7,627,4.10655737704918
