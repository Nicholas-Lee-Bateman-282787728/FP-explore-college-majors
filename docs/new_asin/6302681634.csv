497055,5,6302681634,"To tell the truth I would not have recognized Duvall in the role he played as Stalin. Nevertheless he did a masterful job even had the Russian/Georgian accent down to a certain degree. Ive seen this  film several times which enabled me to know who all the major and minor characters were.  Now I feel I have a better grasp of Russian history during this turbulent period of the revolution and Stalin's reign.
  Of course as most films go its not 100 percent accurate but comes close and the viewer will get a lesson of Russian history during the first half of the 20th century. Like the other reviews it hurriedly moves over ""The Great Patriotic War"" in just a few scenes.
  The film will also help  reveal that Stalin was worst mass murderer in the  20th century or even of all time which most people assume that honor  goes to Adolf Hitler. This is known as the other ""holocaust"" which is lot less known then the Jewish one of Nazi Germany.
  I would highly reccomend the film to any enthusiast of Russian history and see how the Russian people suffered during Stalins reign.",999734400,9,1077,4.5
497056,3,6302681634,"Robert Duvall's portrayal of Josef Stalin in this HBO made-for-TV docudrama is very convincing. Stalin was the most brutal dictator of the 20th century and Duvall does a good job of showing what a callous man Stalin was. Note: Contrary to popular belief, Stalin killed far more people than Hitler did--app. 50 million to 25 million. While this film doesn't dwell on Stalin's atrocities, it does give the viewer a good insight as to how Stalin operated and how he came to power.
Although ""Stalin"" is well-acted and well-produced, it does have its shortcomings. For one thing, I found the movie to be a bit long and as the movie winds down, it loses some of its interest. Also, the casting for the roles of Khruschev and Bukharin could've been a lot better. The guy who plays Khruschev sounds more like an Irishman than a Ukrainian and Jerome Krabbe is clearly miscast in the role of Nikolai Bukharin. For one thing, Bukharin was an older man who had a striking resemblance to Lenin. Here, Krabbe looks and acts like a member of the Moscow State Circus.
All in all, ""Stalin"" is a good movie but it should not be relied upon as a serious historical film. If you want a better insight into the life of Josef Stalin, read Lord Allan Bullock's ""Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives"".",984355200,5,1274,4.616740088105727
497057,5,6302681634,"""Stalin"" is absolutely the best film ever made about Josef  Stalin, the man that largely simultaneously built and ruined Russia for  decades to come.  He was such a paradox and master of creating an image. He  probably would have enjoyed the film himself.
Duvall did a great job  mastering the character, although his accent was a little weak. A great  supporting cast delivered passionate line after line too.  It is excellent!",968889600,5,428,4.943661971830986
497058,4,6302681634,"This was a made-for-HBO cable movie, and it shows.  The dialogue is corny, and there are some of the worst wigs and fake beards you will ever see (Maximillian Schell plays Lenin, and his head looks like a domed stadium.)  But behind a mask of latex, Robert Duvall gives a genuinely great  performance as Stalin.  His eyes look like those of an animal sizing up its  prey.  His heavy-handed humor reveals the sadist within.  It's like he is  only part of a human being pretending to be whole, raging against a world  he fears and despises.  Combine this with the authentic locations (much of  the film was shot inside the Kremlin, in the actual apartments of the  people involved)  and it seems like real, terrible  history is bleeding  into the very print of the movie.  Julia Ormond (whatever happened to her?)  is also very good as Stalin's young, tortured wife.  Duvall has said he is  proud of starring in one of the very few unambiguously anti-Communist films  put out in recent years by the American movie industry.  This is a great  film for history buffs and anyone who ever said the Soviets ""weren't  that bad.""",963532800,6,1120,4.630769230769231

497244,4,6302681634,"Duvall does a really great job and this movie is informative in a general way, but some of the Horrors under Stalin's reign were generalized or overlooked.
For example the people wanted Stalin to know that the military was taking the land and that is shown in the movie as well as the fact that it was Stalin himself who ordered it, but it was a very brief part of the movie and detail was absent. In reality, those who would not conform to the socialist way and the communist regime were removed from their farms and when the communities resisted socialism, their roads were shut off and the food from the farms was shipped elsewhere, leaving the people to starve and die a very slow, miserable death, sometimes eating the dead, including their own children before committing suicide out of guilt. That is such an important part of the Stalin story that is not really addressed in the lengthy movie. The movie also mentions that millions died under Stalin's reign, but I think the movie would have been far more powerful if they had shown what was happening instead of some brief dialogue. It would have been better it had more of how Shindler's List showed what the National Socialist Workers Party (Nazis) did during Hitler's reign. Overall, I recommend the Stalin movie because it has some strong performances, shows the man's suspicion of everyone and his ruthlessness in eliminating what he perceived to be threats. It shows the power struggles of the time and how Stalin had common behavior with Michael Corleone (Godfather).
I watched it on HBO when it was originally aired and have not seen it since 1992, but I definitely remembered it and wanted to see it again and pass it around for others to see and learn from. I think that it would be great if someone remade this. Duvall could still pay Stalin if he wanted. You cannot recognize that it is Duvall due to the make up.

I did not watch the 2nd film yet, but STalin is worth buying and watching. I will watch it again.",1463356800,,1982,4.583098591549295

497329,4,6302681634,"Review of Stalin:

Truly a wonderful miniseries. Robert Duvall gave an extraordinary performance as the dictator Stalin. The movie itself is pretty good and ranges from the history, coming into power, and also the personal life, and horrors that he did to his people, and also to his own personal family. He was a ruthless mean SOB and Robert Duvall plays the weird character perfectly. Only real flaw with the film was it wasn't brutal enough. Stalin killed millions and millions of people, and it really didn't showcase the gritty darkness to his persona and his horrible means. It showcased certain actions and also showcased certain incidents, but to thoroughly understand a dictator, you have to show all the horrible realities they have caused. Duvall and the story telling are brilliant. Flawless acting. Amazing performances.",1454371200,2,833,5.17037037037037

497335,5,6302681634,"I had never saw ""Assassination Tango"" but it was an interesting movie, and would probably be appreciated more by people who enjoy dance type movies.  But I thought it was entertaining for myself.  I really have enjoyed the acting of Robert Duvall throughout the years in everything is a part of.  Some movies he just shines so bright that it takes my breath away.  I saw ""Stalin"" on HBO and was mesmerized the transformation that they did to portray him as Stalin in the movie. The other factor was the background of Stalin being so ruthless.  I never knew a lot of these facts and actually this was the movie that got me researching the subject.  I never looked at Stalin the same, and also knew that General Patton was correct and was totally aware of the threat from the Russians and Stalin.

Overall, the movie does a great job showing Stalin's evil and manipulative character, his extreme paranoia,  and his rise to power as well as his ruthless rule over the USSR. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job acting as the dictator. However, my main criticism of the movie is that it, although showing how Stalin mercilessly executed both his political opponents as well as henchmen, shows very little of the mass atrocities he committed. Only one split second scene of the Gulag camps where tens of millions perished is shown as well as very little about the Ukrainian famine caused by mass collectivization of the farms. I recommend watching the movie to learn about Stalin's character as well as the roles played by other individuals during his reign but reading books to learn more about his atrocities.",1405728000,,870,4.918367346938775

497634,1,6302681634,"This is a review of ""Stalin.""  I did not bother watching ""Assassination Tango.""  ""Stalin"" is a boring, low budget, made for TV ""docu-drama"" from 1992.  It is unforgivably short on historical detail.  The most important action takes place off screen, with little mention.  The background of the revolutionary leaders around Stalin is completely unexplained.  We seem some of them killed off, but we don't know who they are or why they are important.  Stalin's murder of 20,000 of his army's finest officers merits one line in one scene.  Lastly, although even Robert Duvall could not have rescued this pale script, this is the worst acting effort by Duvall I have ever seen.",1393804800,3,673,4.946428571428571

Robert Duvall is absolutely riveting in this role. A quintessential American type becoming the Russian dictator without hammy accent or other ""artificial"" nonsense. Duvall was so good that you don't so much hear his speech as feel Stalin's menace and the power of his personality. Julia Ormond was also exceptional as the  very young woman who becomes Stalin's wife and challenges both his increasing monstrousness and the cowardice of his political allies and friends.

Separately they each do their jobs quite well, but you can't help wondering what they had in mind when they decided to hitch them together.

I understand the guys marketing this DVD package probably believed that releasing ""Stalin"" (one of Robert Duvall's best performances) by itself wouldn't have been profitable, but ""Stalin"" is a serious biopic whereas ""Assassination Tango"" is a workmanlike but not outstanding thriller. Both films stand up quite well on their own, but the package still looks a bit strange sitting on your bookshelf.

But buy it anyway, even if the package is a bit off-putting.

Stalin labeled a deformed man by the new Communist Lenin government quickly moves close to the 'sources of POWER' in the new communist government~ after the overthrow of the CZAR. He simply waits for Lenin to die and ""blackmails"" and then kills all his friends. This simple rule gets him ultimate dictator /commy leader. Oblivious to the starvation and sacrifice of his people he arrogantly has the army purged of ""good officers"" and takes food for money as his people starve and builds an Empire for his own use both financially and ultimate ruler. Robert LOOKS like Stalin right from the BAD dark hair dye job to his accent. Also very worthy of mention is Julia Ormond as his BELOVED wife Nadia who he drove to suicide and then called her a traitor. As Germany invades Russia the neurotic Stalin drinks his way to oblivion and then ruthlessly drives his army to help overthrow Nazi Germany. We also see the uncaring father he is by the death of his son and then his daughter he also drove away. Svletlana the ONLY one who remotely cared for Stalin narrates some of this story. As Stalin dies history will label him a MASS murder thanks to Nakita Kruchef who released the records of the murdered masses 10 years after the demise of Stalin. This is a good bio but 2/12 hours worth the watch for Duval as the commy with an agenda....HIS own. 4 STARS for this movie.

The anti-semitism and cruelty of this man is well documented. In addition, his demonic rule is a reason why communism needed to be defeated and was defeated. Duvall is simply superb.

Assassination Tango was written and directed by Duvall who is in fact a tango dancer and has a home in Buenes Aires. I had not heard of this movie but having it as a bonus was a pleasant surprise.

497778,1,6302681634,"I warn you  now that if you watch this film then you'll laugh your butt off...because it was so badly written and all that.
Let me give you some examples of how this project was messed up.

1. The characterization was terrible, Robert Duvall looked like a mafia guy, he did not look a thing like Stalin, he did not portray his energy well enough for me to mistaken him as Stalin, nor did he sound like Stalin.  He looked as if he was unhappy doing this role and came off as too calm when in real life Stalin was an emotional paranoid person that would probably have a scream match with Nadya if given the chance.  He just did nothing for me at all, he's a better actor than that!

2. They tried to create a one-sided issue to make Stalin look like the only jerk in the relationship between him and his second wife Nadya.  It got to the point where Julie Ormond came off as the villain in the relationship because she was nagging at Stalin to the point where I almost felt badly for him instead of her.  For me Julie is a better actress than this, its as if she had no idea how to portray a woman who hates her husband and loves him at the same time.  In actuality Nadya was a mentally unstable woman even before she married him, and when he found this out after he married her...he lost all of his patience and trust for her.  Of course he doesn't trust her, why would anyone trust their woman when they're yelling at you like a maniac and trying to make you feel guilty!

3. They got the plot wrong!

a)Nadya was actually at the dinner party on the anniversary of the Revolution, she did not just come into town.  And when Stalin threw his cigarette butt at her he was trying to get her attention because he thought that she was being disrespectful for not raising her glass.
b)Yes Stalin probably slept with some other woman on the night that Nadya shot and killed herself, but nobody knows that for sure.  Also it was probably with a wife of a comrade, not a Georgian dancer.  Anyways, he went off with her to her apparment, Stalin did not actually return to the Kremlin until the next day, by that time he was told and not showed that his wife was dead.
c)Nadya already knew before Stalin married her that Stalin was widowed and he had Yakov from his first wife.
d)It was Molotov's wife Polina who was Nadya's best friend, not Zhenya, Zhenya was her sister-in-law.  It was to Polina that she confessed in real life that she was tired of Stalin and the children.
e)Yes Stalin was anti-Semitic, but also keep in mind that Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew and was glad to help Stalin out killing other Jews and so on forth.

4. Yes the scenery was beautiful and made me want to go to Russia all the more.

5. Last but not least, I just could not watch the rest of the movie, because all these conferences that Stalin was at with his henchmen board me to death!  Needless to say I'm glad I stopped watching this retarded version of Stalin's life!  Beware!",1291075200,2,2949,4.281081081081081

497833,4,6302681634,"I agree with Leaming.  Any time Hollywood depicts history, there are going to be issues of inaccuracy, artistic license, etc.  In the case of the film STALIN, this is mostly due to the need to compress about thirty years into less than three hours.  The portrayals of the primary characters are sometimes simplistic and inaccurate, but Bukharin and Kirov's characters (for example) are portrayed so as to accentuate the perception of Stalin as a monster (which is accurate).  In other words, the truth is adapted somewhat to generate a dramatic foil.  Films are never a substitute for reading the real history, but I find that they often whet an appetite when one did not previously exist.  The mini-series PETER THE GREAT with Maximilian Schell in the title role is another great example of a film that generated popular interest in Tsarist Russia.  SHOGUN, ROUGH RIDERS, LAST SAMURAI, GLADIATOR, GODS AND GENERALS, SHARPE'S RIFLES -- all are examples of films that prompted people to actually read history.  So, take the films for what they are -- all in all, everyone who loves history should encourage this terrific trend in film-making!",1076112000,10,1141,5.0
497834,4,6302681634,"This film is historically excellent.  What most reviewers seem hung up on are accents, make-up and costumes.  Most comment that it is historically inaccurate but give nothing very specific.  The film is a broad overview of the life of Stalin and could never include every element of his life.  All the important stuff is there:  the Revolution, the power struggle between Trotsky and Stalin, Stalin's rise to power, The great famines, The Great Purges, WWII, etc.  The film gives great insight into Stalin and the paranoia that he experienced and how that paranoia influenced the way he ruled over the Soviet Union.  Sure, many of the other characters were somewhat glossed over, but the film is essentially about Stalin and what made him tick - not about the intricate backgrounds of other revolutionaries and supporters.  If you don't come away from the film thinking what a bastard Stalin was, then you simply missed the point.  The way that he treated his family, friends and so called counterrevolutionaries is illustrated correctly in this film.
The end of the film brings up a very important question that I think many previous reviewers had difficulty with.  Fact:  under Stalin the Soviet Union industrialized to levels never seen before.  With industrialization, this could enable the USSR to compete in the world on par with the US.  It would also lead to the development of a nuclear and hydrogen bomb, on par with the US.  The film brings up the critical question of whether or not Stalin was necessary for the USSR.  That is a powerful and thought provoking question that one carries away from this film.  Any film that lingers and makes you think has merit.
The history channel put out a video on the parallels of Hitler and Stalin.  As I was watching it I kept thinking, ""Gee, everything in this documentary is in the film Stalin.""
Is it a perfect film?  No.  Is it historically innaccurate to merit throwing it away?  Absolutely not...  Robert Duvall does an excellent and convincing job of portraying a monster.",1075161600,14,2029,4.857142857142857
497835,3,6302681634,"In the past, apologists for Stalin (including many of his victims) said that Stalin was good, but he was surrounded by bad people.  This film turns this on its head saying that Stalin was bad, but he was surrounded by good people.  Both of these are wrong--the leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution and the leaders of the USSR in the period following the revolution were all up to their necks in blood.  Robert Duvall gives an excellent portrayal of Stalin, emphasizing that he, unlike his ranting partner in mass murder Hitler, was soft-spoken and basically uncharismatic.  Duvall correctly does not use a ""Russian"" accented English because Stalin spoke Russian with a heavy Georgian accent.  Having said this, the historical aspects of the film are very poor.  First of all, Maximilian Schell's portrayal of Lenin is way off base.  The Old Bolsheviks like Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Ordzhonikidze and Kirov are shown to be basically well-meaning people who got trapped in Stalin's web.  This is untrue, they were all involved in mass terror, justifying it in the name of a ""higher good"".  In Solzhenitsyn's ""Gulag Archipelago"", he points out what a pathetic man Bukharin really was and how he so freely shed tears for the injustice committed to his person, and yet he had no pity on the millions of others who suffered.  At the end of the film, Khruschev says that Stalin's crimes (""the millions"" he liquidated) had to be accounted for, whereas,in reality,  he himself took an active role in the Great Terror.
The film shows very little of what the effect of ""Stalinism"" was on the average Soviet citizen, with the exception of a scene where Stalin's wife confronts the effects of the mass famine in the Ukraine.  The film does not really show the ""cult of the personality"".  It would have been effective if the film had shown how, when Stalin would enter a hall full of people, the crowd would applaud for a very long time because everyone was afraid to be the first to stop clapping.  Similarly, towards the end of the film, we see a physician nervously examining Stalin without any mention of the infamous ""Doctors Plot"" frame-up in which Jewish doctors were falsely accused of trying to murder top Soviet officials which would explain the physicians hesitancy in examing his famous patient.
In spite of the many faults of this film, I have still given it three stars rating because it is important for people to become aware of what this monster did to so many millions of innocent people and who was supported by millions of otherwise good people, both inside and outside the USSR.",1061078400,57,2597,4.832957110609481
497836,3,6302681634,"To all the reviewers who think Duvall captured the ""real"" Joseph Stalin, please run to a bookshelf and consult a non-fictional history of the man. The real Stalin does not appear in this sometimes facile, oftentimes inaccurate biography of the Russian dictator. Originally airing as an HBO TV movie, there are an abundance of errors in the script, as well as a host of other problems.
First, the make-up is amateurish and truly detracts from the viewing experience. Duvall's mustache is a clear paste-on job and in several scenes, the left side of the whiskers almost falls off his face. It's comical at times but ultimately becomes ludicrous in the extreme. His wig is also absurd and fake looking. While this might seem a minor criticism, the make up on the other chief characters is equally ridiculous and cheap. The costumes are also inaccurate in many instances. The color of Stalin's uniform at Yalta in 1944 was not yellow, the color of his uniform at Postsdam in 1945 was not blue!
The historical inaccuracies in the movie are continuous. The characteizations are facile, transparent and weak. Of course Stalin was evil incarnate and a paranoid schizophrenic, but the script doesn't bother to delve into the question of why this was so. There is little material about either of his two wives, or his children. All of that is glossed over. Another silly aspect are the abysmal accents that all of the actors
The only reason I give this a generous rating of 3 is because Duvall is a brilliant actor. Though horribly miscast (and made up to resemble more of a circus clown that Stalin), his acting abilities do shine through.

Lenin and Trotsky are portrayed as simple-minded, hearts-in-the-right place chaps when in reality they were both as guilty as Stalin of brutality, paranoia, and countless ""official murders and exilings.""  History also tell us that Stalin was a peasant who became a revolutionary journalist but never was as ""socially polished"" as Duvall portrays him.

Checking in at three hours (as long as 'Nixon') this features Robert Duval in a series of Elvis-like wigs as Stalin's soon-to-be-born daughter does voice-overs. Following Lenin's death (he is depicted as a good guy) Stalin gets married and takes over. Very soon after he determine that virtually EVERYBODY is an ENEMY! So, he has them killed off and/or starved to death. Dreadful.

His daughter grows up and then WWII occurs and he does not have enough people to fight the war! Dumb! Filmed on location the director is fond of tracking scenes (after all it was filmed in 1992 shortly after the fall of the U. S.S.R.) Thick accents and no sub-title option. Looks good.

An aging (uptight) hit man is sent to South America to do a job. The guy he is supposed to get has to go to the hospital for three weeks so the hit man has to hang out, missing a family engagement back home, he is ticked. So, he resorts to 'Dancing with the Stars' behavior. Lame, swearing. Avoid.",1504310400,,979,4.52542372881356
