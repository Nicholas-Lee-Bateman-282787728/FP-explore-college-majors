1970753,2,B00014NF02,"Im a John Grisham fan, and while I don't think that Runaway Jury is his best book, its still a damn good one none the less. The whole plot of the original book is thrown out for an over preaching fight for gun control, and some of the characters of the novel are ether gone or diminish in a certain capacity. Dustin Hoffmans character is only a small supporting player in the book, but is a major player in the movie. Maybe because the filmmakers wanted to highlight the confrontation between him and Gene Hackman, which was good but not in the original book ether. I also think that it was irresponsible for the filmmakers to have such a strong stance for gun control, considering the fact that the country is split down the middle on this touchy subject.
I will give the movie one big credit, the performance of Rachel Weisz was the best thing in this over preaching mess. She was in my opinion, the only actor who really captured the essence of her character, and made the character her own with her fine performance. See the movie for her fine performance alone, and if not, rent Confidence or The Shape of Things; both have great performances by Rachel Weisz, and are much better movies to boot.",1066694400,19,1200,4.4840182648401825
1970754,5,B00014NF02,"I'm not a fan John Grisham but I found Runaway Jury quite good.  I don't know how accurate the legal system was portrayed in the film, but the story was very engrossing and the performances were really good. Gene Hackman was amazing, and very ruthless in his performance, and Dustin Hoffman as great as his adversary in law. Rachel Weisz was great as Marlee, and she really does almost walk away with the film. John Cusack has been very versatile in his pick of movies lately, and he is proving to be quite a great actor.
Again, I don't know if the movie is accurate in it's portrayal of the law but it's a good movie none the less.",1066608000,5,632,4.310924369747899
1970755,3,B00014NF02,"This is a Fair John Grisham Adaptation, and it's better than the earlier adaptation of his previous books (The Client, The Chamber, and Pelican Brief) But while does hold as a good adaptation, it is the least faithful of them all. The Tobacco Argument that was the main highlight of the book is replace with a gun control argument that really does not fit with the tapestry of the story.  It's a good argument but it needed more of an angle for it to really work. The acting is top notch with Gene Hackman chewing up the scenery as a crooked jury consultant, Rachel Weisz as a mysterious woman trying to sell the verdict , John Cusack as a juror with a secret and Dustin Hoffman rounds out the great cast as a southern Lawyer who is trying to get justice for a murdered office worker. All the performances are really good, but it's too bad the screenplay that was written by four people, did not meet their talent.",1066608000,2,914,4.408284023668639
1970756,4,B00014NF02,"I have not read the book by John Grisham, so I can't compare it but I really liked the film. Not only did it held my attention but it rally made me think a lot about issues brought up in the film.  I think the major thing that made the movie so good was the actors involved. I've been a Gene Hackman fan for ages, and he really made this movie work, and I think that Dustin Hoffman was great as well. The best acting though does go to Rachel Weisz who was tough as nails, and took no prisoners. I've admired her work before, and this proves to me that is one hell of an actress. John Cusack is another fine actor and it's nice to see him do more diverse roles.
All, and all, a good movie.",1066608000,6,688,3.949640287769784
1970757,3,B00014NF02,"I did like the movie, but the whole anti gun preaching and the illogical plot points concerning Jury tampering were a bit much, and highly improbable to be real. The only saving grace here though is the acting, which deserves a much better movie. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz really made this film work with their performances. Gene's performance made his character more dimensional than it needed to be, and more though provoking, and Rachel Weisz gives a great performance with a character that really should have had more screen time than she did.
Dustin Hoffman was fine but was really no more than scenery and John Cusack was decent but needed more work.
To Be Honest, The movie would had not been as good with out the performances of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, and if the movie would have had been in their level of acting, the movie would have been much better.",1066521600,15,873,4.638709677419355
1970758,5,B00014NF02,"RUNAWAY JURY is one of the more satisfying of John Grisham novels to be brought to the screen.  The screenplay is intelligent and has sufficient bite to maintain attention right up to the surprising end.  Much credit goes to Director Gary Felder for his approach to this trial tale set in smarmy New Orleans, a trial based on an individual's lawsuit against a gun manufacturing empire for the death of her husband who was an innocent victim of a workplace shooting spree (sound familiar?). The lawyers are Dustin Hoffman for the plaintiff giving a performance of great dignity and understated power and Bruce Davison (likewise excellent) as the mouthpiece defense lawyer for the corrupt gun manufacturers who have enlisted Gene Hackman (in a superlatively malevolent role) to rig the jury.  Sitting on the jury is John Cusack (in his finest performance yet) with an agenda of his own.  The remainder of the jury includes such fine actors as Luis Guzman, Nora Dunn, Jennifer Beals etc and Bruce McGill as the Judge all, once again, tuned to low key, very pungent acting.  Rachel Weisz and Dylan McDermott flesh out this homogenously excellent cast.  An exceptionally well written, well directed, well acted film that rates with the finest courtroom dramas of the past.  This is a pwerful case for Gun Control. Worth seeing again!",1066435200,2,1328,4.954954954954955
1970759,2,B00014NF02,"I saw this movie and it wasn't the worst movie of the year but it wasn't very good either.  A waste of time and money.  Very flat and unimaginative.  Better to see it on cable.  But the first review of this movie posted her on Amazon made me suspicious.  I have heard from others that since Amazon doesn't screen the reviews of anything posted, it's more than likely that people who need/want a product to be sucessful (including movies) will deliberately post overly positive reviews knowing that people are all to easily fooled.  I suspect it with this post.  Please...don't waste your time and $$$ with this movie.  It's simply not worth it when there are other, much better movies out there like ""School of Rock"", or ""Lost in Translation"".",1066348800,3,743,4.661538461538462
1970760,4,B00014NF02,"Good Entry in the John Grisham series of books made into movies that is almost as good as The Firm. All The actors involved make this movie a real treat to see. Gene Hackman is fantastic as always, Dustin Hoffman's come back continues with full force with he great performance. Rachel Weisz gives Gene Hackman a run for his money with her strong and wonderful performance, and John Cusack makes himself a real contender for the mantle Tom Hanks has for the most natural actor around.
Don't expect every body to agree with what the movie is trying to say but it's a poignant message to consider.",1066348800,11,594,4.5607476635514015

1970762,4,B00014NF02,"I was invited by a friend from the press to a viewing of the new John Grisham film, Runaway Jury. He knew that I was a fan of the original book, so he invited me to tag along with him while he reviewed the film. Now for starters, The movie is really nothing like the book at all. Some characters have their roles extended while some have theirs diminish. (Dustin Hoffman's role has been greatly extended from the book) and the original argument of the tobacco industry is change to a fight about gun control. While this makes this film the least faithful of all of John Grisham's books turn to movies, it turns out to be the second best of all of them (The Firm of course being the best). Gene Hackman makes the character of Rankin Fitch
His own, bring a sense of menace to his role. While this is Gene's third go around in a John Grisham movie, this is his best turn. He really has a commanding presence, and commands the screen with zeal. Dustin Hoffman is well cast as Wendell Rohr, Hackman's counterpart in the lawsuit. While Dustin's character was not as prominent in the book, his character is giving a nice boost up in the film. Maybe because of the stature of an actor that Dustin Hoffman is but in the long run is really not as commanding a presence as Gene Hackman is in this movie. John Cusack is perfect as Nicholas Easter, making him sort of a every man hero with a purpose but also with a secret that will not be reveled by me (you got to see the movie) And Rachel Weisz is perfection in the flesh as. Marlee. Not only does she captures the character with a sense of coolness, mystery, and complexity but she also holds her own with the great Gene Hackman, and does not lose face in the process. Her performance is as captivating as Hackman, and just as powerful.
While there is more character interaction that court room interaction (unlike the book). You never feel cheated by what is on screen.
Don't expect a faithful connection to the book, but expect a very good movie none the less.",1066003200,15,2003,4.372654155495979

1970771,4,B00014NF02,"Great movie, although not perfect.  Hackman was great as  manipulative lawyer who would do anything to win.  Smug.  It was nice when Marlie, made him show weakness and led  him to lose temper.
Hoffman to me played the character that was most pure, and stuck to his values. He was going to be classy win or lose. The cusack and Weisz characters more complicated.  They were manipulative too, and Weisz in particular was a pretty cold fish till the ending.  Fight scene not too realistic , but Marlie was a central character.  This movie does make you wander if jury can be tampered with so easily .  In the end , Hackman got his come uppance. Hoffman walks away content with a slight grin.  Weisz and Cuzack billked 10 million $ and was stated would help the needy.  As a co juror, I would have been angry at the shenanigans of cuzack and Weisz.",1509840000,,844,4.415584415584416

1970837,1,B00014NF02,"When I read the synopsis on the back of this DVD's jewel case, I thought I was merely buying a ""thriller"" about ""a ruthless jury consultant,"" but nothing about the liberal propaganda I would discover near the beginning of the film.  Although the synopsis implied that this film is about a court case and corrupt people trying to rig it, it never mentioned what the case was about.

It's about ""gun control.""

The opening sequence shows a massacre, ending with the murder of a businessmen while he was trying to learn a song to sing to his child at bedtime that night - a song he would never live to sing to his child.  A song he would probably have lived to sing to his child if he or one of his fellow employees or customers had possessed a gun and returned fire when the disgruntled gunman drew his.

As a result, a lawyer sues, on behalf of that child and his mother, the company that produced the gun which was used to kill the boy's father.

Dustin Hoffman plays this lawyer, with Jeremy Piven co-starring as a consultant who joins the anti-gun team for 30% of his normal salary because he feels so strongly about the issue.

Gene Hackman plays the evil jury consultant who represents the evil gun and ammunition producers, who, in this fictional world, are losing money because of the adverse publicity surrounding the massacres perpetuated by people using their products.

Meanwhile, back in reality, guns and ammunition are selling like hotcakes as more and more people fear more and more greatly, as time passes, the hypocritical liberals, such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who, like many liberal Hollywood celebrities, are surrounded 24-7 by armed bodyguards, yet constantly try to disarm the people they are supposed to serve.

This liberal propaganda film also takes a couple shots at another pet peeve of liberals:  smoking.  During a brief conversation with an elderly man who's coughing with a cigarette in his mouth, John Cusack's character tells him he should quit smoking, but, clueless, the man asks why.  Later, one of the jurors lights up in a room where the jury is obligated to remain, and several of the other jurors tell him not to smoke, and preach about the evils of secondhand smoke.

As a retired U.S. Army Staff Sergeant, I take particular exception to the way the retired U.S. Marine Master Sergeant on the jury is portrayed as a self-righteous, heartless buffoon who could only get menial jobs such as being a pool boy after he served in several conflicts and retired from the Marine Corps.

SPOILER ALERT!  John Cusack and Rachel Weisz' characters seem like greedy jury tamperers throughout most of the film, but at the end, it turns out that they are merely anti-gun Robin Hoods stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, and had no intention of rigging the jury, because they were confident that the jurors would make the right choice, and convict the evil gun makers.

I think I would enjoy watching Gene Hackman make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Requires MAJOR suspension of disbelief if you know much about actual civil litigation including jury selection. And it'll help to lean hard left while watching this film, since the general theme here is that violating all kinds of state and federal laws is perfectly okay, in fact, it's downright NOBLE, if it's in service of a good end. So now that I think of it, the story is both clever and stupid at the same time. The clever parts kept me watching all the way through.

The great book was about a trial won, courtesy of  a sneaky, stealth couple Nick and Marlee.

But they won against tobacco, not guns!!!

Now, Hollywood figured that battle was over. Lets make it guns the issue.

I never heard of gun addiction. I never heard of putting more stuff into guns to make them more addictive - so they had to come up with a really bizarre story to justify Nick and Marlee's.

This reminds me of the great book by Michael Crighton ""Rising Sun"" in which Japanese business people use dirty tricks to run American competition out of business - turned upside down by a movie that portrayed those same Japanese well.",1456617600,3,732,4.507575757575758

1970888,5,B00014NF02,"John Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Dustin Hoffman, and Gene Hackman turn in an awesome ensemble performance in this riveting story about jury-tampering to sway the verdict of a major trial.  I liked this movie very much, and give it 5-stars.  Some interesting observations about the movie (spoiler alert)...

Gene Hackman has been in several movies based on Grisham novels -- The Firm, The Chamber, Runaway Jury -- and in each one gives a stellar performance. Ever since the beginning, ""The French Connection,"" Hackman has shown the breadth of his acting ability throughout his career.

It is interesting that throughout the movie, the attorney for the plaintiff, Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) is ultimately butting heads with the defense's jury consultant Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman), not the attorney for the  defense. The men's room scene with Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman is a priceless performance, and ironic in a sense that Rohr says at the end that Fitch will eventually end up with ""nothing"", maybe not today or with this trial, but someday. And Fitch replies that it may be true but he doesn't really give a s***. However, at the end when Fitch does end up with nothing, he really does give a s***.

After the verdict outside the courthouse, Wendell Rohr and Marlee (Rachel Weisz) look at each other and then smile. Is it because Rohr knows about the earlier case and then recognizes Nick's (John Cusack) and Marlee's reasons for swaying the verdict his way, or is it simply because he can now rest easy NOT having paid the fee for the verdict which ultimately went his way, and he is satisfied that Nick and Marly swung it his way?

Although the verdict ultimately goes the plaintiff's way giving the audience a satisfying ending to the story, it is still disconcerting that it only did so with the help of jury-tampering, and still raises the question of how just justice really is.",1447545600,,1889,4.8478260869565215

1970957,1,B00014NF02,"The Runaway Jury

This film is set in New Orleans (before the hurricane). People enter an office to start the day's work. (It was a day-trader operation!) Then shots are heard and people go down. Two years later a man gets a Jury Summons. Nicholas Easter is under surveillance as he walks along the street. A passenger talks to the cab driver. A jury consultant meets with the lawyer who is suing a gun manufacturer. Do jury consultants do a background investigation on the jurors? [The use of ""ropers"" goes back a long, long way.] We see the tricks used to spy on people. Some say selecting the jury is half the battle in winning at trial. A gun manufacturer is being sued because its product was misused to kill a stockbroker who fleeced his customer. [Greed and money are one of the prime causes of murder.] Is a car manufacturer liable because its product was misused?

There is a dramatic scene during jury selection; the consultant correctly advised against a juror. Next there is a propaganda scene about the alleged evils of gun manufacturing. Other jurors are examined. One juror's secret is that he is working on his own hidden agenda. Nicholas Easter is able to manipulate the jury to select the foreman! The plaintiff's lawyer makes a speech blaming the gun manufacturer. There is personal conflict in the jury room over smoking. Nick shows his manipulative skills again, and gains favor among the jurors. Then Wendell mentions his anti-gun support back in Washington. [No mention of who they are!] Nick uses his skills to get the jury to act in concert. But there was a tell-tale act that pointed to Nick! An investigator searched his room to learn about his background. There is an action scene, then retaliation against a juror. Could a private investigator really do such checking on a sitting jury without wearing rubber gloves? There is more drama among the jurors.

Marlee arranges a meeting with Fitch to discuss fixing the jury; the question is about the price. Frank notices how Nick is playing the jurors. The plaintiff's key witness has not shown up! Wendell has a dramatic talk with Fitch. Then he goes back to the fat cats who are paying for this suit to ask for more money. In court he badgers the owner of the gun company. Fitch finds out more about Nick's background. Then we learn more about Marlee's skills. The last day has Wendell's speech about making the gun manufacturer liable for other people's misuse of their product. Nick continues to manipulate the jury during deliberations, he provokes Frank into an outburst that affects the other jurors into making a decision. [No jury has ever made such a decision.]

I found the book to be much better than this film, which made changes in the story that resulted in a deserved flop at the box office. One flaw in the story is its complexity and incredibility. Could a lone juror be able to manipulate jury selection as in this story? The scene in the jury room doesn't ring true because it depends on a last minute trick for these cardboard characters. Would two young adults pull off this complex scheme in order to give away all that money? This story is hard to believe. That would explain its failure.",1411603200,2,3188,4.6976744186046515

1970982,5,B00014NF02,"While a number of important things were changed from the John Grisham novel this was based on (including the removal of the word ""The"" from the title), this film retained the spirit of its source material and was better for it.  After her husband is murdered by a workplace shooter who then killed himself, she resolves to sue the gun manufacturer who made the murder weapon.  She is represented by Wendell Rohr, played by Dustin Hoffman, an idealistic attorney who desires to finally hold the gun makers accountable for what their products are used for.  Unbeknownst to them, the defense has retained Rankin Fitch, played by Gene Hackman, a man with a knack for profiling people who uses his talents to help select juries and, more importantly, manipulate the selected jury to vote in his clients' favor.  In the middle of this is Nicholas Easter, played by John Cusack, a young man working at a videogame arcade who is summoned for jury duty and, after being a wise guy towards the judge, is selected to sit on the jury of the gun case.  But it soon becomes apparent, to the viewer at least, that good old Nick Easter is up to something.  And then there's the fact that Rankin Fitch is suddenly receiving calls from a mysterious woman called Marlee, played by Rachel Weisz, who knows all about his illegal activities and intends to outdo him.  This was a great adaptation with an all-star cast.  I especially enjoyed the confrontation between Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman...this was apparently their first scene together ever after they'd already been good friends for over forty years.  Speaking of Dustin Hoffman, his character Wendell Rohr is more ethical in the movie than the book but he is thankfully not prissy...I credit that to the actor.  I liked this movie very much and I don't care that the subject of the lawsuit in the center of the plot was guns instead of cigarettes as was the case in the book.  The ending was a bit corny and too perfect, but I'll let that go.  Enjoy.",1403308800,9,1992,4.66

When the case goes to trial, the manufacturer takes no chances on the outcome of case by hiring a ""jury consultant"" firm that makes it his business to see that he knows enough about the jurors to be able to guarantee the result of the trial favorable to them.

This legal thriller is definitely efficient,precise and very entertaining.

1971003,4,B00014NF02,"Runaway Jury, based on the novel of the same name by the incomparable John Grisham, poses the question of whether or not justice can be bought through juries. Rather than bribing, kidnapping or murdering suspects and attorneys, why not go after the jury? The story chronicles a lawsuit, not a criminal trial, involving a widow suing a large gun manufacturer as being indirectly complicit in the death of her husband, and she's seeking monetary damages. The first scene, which almost seems like the beginning of an entirely different story, ends with a shoot-out at a business office. However, the crime itself is only the beginning of a much larger puzzle.

The widow hires plaintiff attorney Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) who seems over-matched against the man at the helm for the defense. Enter Rankin Fitch, a cunning corporate defense attorney who has created a secret infrastructure using state-of-the-art technology to profile potential juries and zap unfavorable ones from the courtroom before anyone is the wiser, played with dominant hot-headedness by the incomparable Gene Hackman. Fitch and Co. hide their set-up of computer screens, monitors, and data links, and use their information to scope out the people who may ultimately decide the fate of their clients.

Fitch, though not actually presenting the case in the courtroom, works behind the scenes not only to push people out of the courtroom who have an agenda but those perceived as ""wild cards"" who might be difficult to read in terms of their opinions. As the story unfolds, we learn Fitch has been playing this game for a very long time, typically at the behest of the large gun manufacturers. One great line by Fitch sums up how he sees the case if it is won for the defense: ""You just ensure that his wife goes to the cemetery in a better car."" He also says that trials are too important to be decided by juries. Fitch will decide the verdict, not the jury, or at least that's what the gun manufacturers are paying him for.

Nicholas Easter (John Cusack) is a prospective juror who might lose out on a chance to be a video game tournament champion worth $100,000 if he is chosen to serve on the jury. Or at least, that is what we perceive at first. But as events unfold, he appears more and more like he actually wants to serve, and his reluctance may in fact be an act. During the course of the trial, he befriends the other jurors, thereby gaining their trust. Then, in an interesting twist, each of the attorneys is handed a note which could change both how they view and handle their respective cases.

An outstanding story with a first-rate ensemble cast. Although Cusack is top-billed, all the players are heavy-hitters in the acting department, including the jurors. Rachel Weisz is equally compelling as Cusack's accomplice working on the ""outside"" while Cusack works on the inside. And the story ends up with an interesting reference to to the Columbine High School shooting, although the name is changed.

1971008,2,B00014NF02,"'Runaway Jury' stars John Cusack, Gene Hackman, and Dustin Hoffman in a 2003 adaptation of a John Grisham novel. The plot centers around the liability trial of a firearms manufacturer whose product had been used by a disgruntled former to exact revenge via a mass shooting. Underlying the obvious battle between the opposing attorneys is one between jury consultant Hackman and jury member John Cusack. Cusack, we eventually learn, has made a quasi-career out of trying to get himself onto similar trials ever since a gun manufacturer liability suit involving the death of his current girlfriend's (Rachel Weisz) sister while he was present.

The plot would have 1,000% greater credibility if Cusack's role was simply limited to trying to influence the jury. Instead, in conjunction with Rachel Weisz, the pair also try to extort millions from both sides in return for a favorable verdict. With that, the film immediately loses any sense of credibility - there is no doubt that in real life both attorneys would immediately refer such an effort immediately to the judge. In addition, attempting to extort the attorney pursuing the gun-manufacturer makes even less sense.

Eventually the gun manufacturer is found liable, $110 million is awarded the plaintiff whose husband was killed, and Cusack/Weisz collect $15 million extorted from Hackman and his gun manufacturing backers.

Reality - efforts to assign liability to gun manufacturers for not taking reasonable steps to prevent sale of firearms to straw purchasers who likely intend to resell the weapons on the black market (the premise in the movie) are impossible due to special legal immunity Congress provided the industry in 2005. Unlike other industries, gun manufacturers and sells can commit negligence with legal impunity. Grisham would have done far better to focus on that ongoing injustice.

It's a horrible case (no wonder no one has tried it) and an even worse straw-man defense: ""I don't care who gets hurt--the second amendment!""

The second amendment isn't why it's right to allow the right to bear arms, the second amendment is there to insure our rights aren't violated by the government. WE don't have a right to bear arms in order to hunt; we have that right in order to protect ourselves from psychopaths (in government or otherwise).

The story is about the U.S. legal process of voir-dire - the selection of jurors by attorneys so as to rig the jury in order to get the desired verdict. Here, one of the jurors, Nicholas Easter (John Cusack), together with an accomplice Marlee (Rachel Weisz) on the outside, have an agenda of their own that will aid the prosecution without their knowledge. The issue before the court is a claim for substantial damages, led by Wendall Rohr (Dustin Hoffman), for the prosecution, against gun manufacturers for the murder of Jacob Wood (Dylan McDermott). The prosecution is being brought by Jacob's widow Celeste (Joanna Going). Defending the arms manufacturers in court is Durwood Cable (Bruce Davison), but the power behind the defence, doing his best to manipulate the jury, is Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman). Hearing the case is Judge Frederick Harkin (Bruce McGill).

  Jacob Wood (Dylan McDermott) arrives at his workplace, a stock brokerage firm. Suddenly, someone walks into the building in a shooting rampage. Mr. Wood is also shot and killed.
  Two years later, this case is brought to trial. Jury consultant Rankin Finch has a covert team to get background information on people to select them for a jury summons.
  This movie suggests if you are being considered to be put on a jury, you will be followed in your daily life even if you walk on the sidewalk and if you are selected on the jury, you will still be investigated because you are not allowed to talk about the case with anyone until the trial is over and the judge dismisses you.
  People selected for jury duty can be fair, people of different races from all walks of life.

 One man is Nick Easter (John Cusack) selected for Jury Duty. He knows he is being watched. They break into his apartment and download his computer. He tries to get out of jury duty, but the Judge (Bruce McGill) won't let him.

 Rankin Finch wants more juicy information of every juror. He doesn't want his jury to fall apart.

 Durwood Cable (Bruce Davison) is an attorney working for Finch. He is wearing an illegal electronic surveillance in the courtroom.

 Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) is an attorney losing his footing on this court case.

 Also in the cast: Rachel Weisz, Jeremy Piven, Joanna Going, Nora Dunn, Jennifer Beals, Luis Guzman, Henry Darrow, Ed nelson, Marco St. John.

 Filmed in Louisiana, including New Orleans, Kenner, Metairie, Riverwalk and Jefferson Parish. Also Olvera Street, Los Angeles, California.

1971049,4,B00014NF02,"Dustin Hoffman as a lawyer? It works, believe it or not.

The basic story involves a high-powered jury consultant. That's a guy who is hired to help select a jury by investigating everything possible about each of the prospective jurors. In a major case, where millions of dollars are involved, it is not unreasonable for a large defense firm to hire such a consultant, although I'd be surprised if any of them have the resources this guy displays. Perhaps they do. It's a big enough case.

Hoffman is the lawyer representing the widow of a man gunned down by an automatic weapon in the hands of a maniac. She sues the gun manufacturer and distributor for having sold this nut the gun. Not, you would say, an easy case to win. Especially not easy when he hires a small-time, one-man jury consultant and the gun company hires this big high-tech supported firm. Forgive me if I suggest that the main reason this film was made was to show off the high-tech surveillance equipment used by the jury consultant.

This was the only one of the Grisham films I had to play again in order to remember enough about it to review it. But don't take that as meaning I didn't enjoy the film. I remembered the outcome, and the way it caught me totally by surprise. But I couldn't include that, now could I?

1971051,4,B00014NF02,"Runaway Jury is a great, fun, suspenseful flick which I have been waiting for on Blu for some time now.

The PQ is decent, however I was slightly disappointed with the contrast. The picture seems a bit dark in many scenes and there isn't a huge amount of depth or that pop which I was looking for. However all things considered I think they did a great job respecting the movie and bringing us a quality Blu-ray. There are no signs of intense noise reduction or over sharpening. It seems to be somewhere in the middle which is comfortable for a film like this.

Lately there have been many older, ""B"", lesser-known films coming out on Blu for $7.99 that simply look awful. Runaway Jury is NOT one of those cheap Blu-rays. It actually looks quite good, however it could be better. There is no grain yet it is not overly smooth.

The AQ is also quite good for such a vocal film.

It is filled with twists and turns and suspense, and has a surprise ending. The jury consultant wants to persuade twelve jurors to render the verdict he wants. The tricks he uses are fascinating. He has a large team, including highly disreputable even brutal people, who study the past lives of the jurors, their psychology, weaknesses, behaviors, and the secrets they try to hide.

I remember seeing this film years ago at my Aunt's house in Austin after I helped her move there. She picked it up at the store and we watched it the night we finished moving everything in, her, my Uncle, and of course myself. I have always been a fan of the courtroom movies and was excited to finally see it, and it didn't disappoint. I knew going in I would like it though since I liked every one in the cast. There is just something about court room movies and shows don't cha think.

The movie follows two people who will stop at nothing to get involved in a high profile trial. Why would they want to do such a thing one may ask, well to play both sides for money of course. But first one of them must get selected to be on the jury so they plan and plan until they finally get on. Once there the chess game plays out wonderfully but all is not as it seems, from all sides.

I have to say that John Cusack actually did a really good job here and I say that because sometimes people seem miscast. When I had first seen the trailer for this I thought he looked a little out of place amongst the others. I have to say he did a great job and proved me wrong, he fit right in. of course we all knew going in Gene Hackman would be great in this and he nearly steals the show in every scene. Dustin Hoffman is great as always and plays the straight up good lawyer perfectly, Hoffman and Hackman finally on screen together. Rachel Weisz could be up against Hackman and them for MVP, she is excellent in this film.

Director Gary Fleder did a good job with Grisham's story and made a film any one could enjoy. I certainly did enjoy it although it is not the best courtroom drama ever. Still I do recommend this film to all who have yet to see it. It is a highly entertaining film with a wonderful cast.",1305417600,,1813,4.098591549295775
1971057,5,B00014NF02,"I count this one in my top three favorite John Grisham film adaptations, along with THE FIRM and THE RAINMAKER. RUNAWAY JURY, a crackling good legal thriller, raises issues concerning jury tampering and gun control. These, to me, would normally be snorefests for topics, but damn if the cast isn't so good that I got instantly swept away by the plot. It goes like this: Two years ago, one morning, in his brokerage firm, a stockbroker was fatally gunned down during a mass slaying by a crazed day trader who then turned the gun on himself. Today is the slain stockbroker's widow's day in court. Today, in New Orleans, she's putting the gun industry on trial. The news media is all a-hubbub. This case isn't cut and dried.

RUNAWAY JURY registers high on the implausibility meter, but it's so well executed that it's no great inconvenience to play along. The story gives us a peek into what goes on behind the scenes of a news media-saturated trial. Specifically, in the area of jury consulting. Gene Hackman plays Rankin Fitch, preeminent jury expert and an uncanny profiler. Fitch's distinguished track record hinges on certain unsavory practices. Fitch's war room is graced with cutting edge surveillance technology and peopled with behavioral psychologists and strong-arm bully boys. Fitch frequently has his prospective jurors tailed. When called for, he resorts to blackmail and intimidation to cow a juror, to maybe even swing a juror. Rankin Fitch is slimy and has the moral backbone of an evil snail. But damn if he isn't sharp and wicked observant. He pretty much tells the prosecutor how to run his end of the trial.

Except Rankin Fitch is about to get played. A mysterious woman named Marlee (Rachel Weisz) offers to deliver a verdict to the highest bidder. Dustin Hoffman plays the (purposely) rumpled and folksy defense attorney Wendell Rohr, and Rohr, a play-by-the-rules kind of litigator, reacts to this offer with proper outrage. Fitch is more dismissive, calling Marlee ""an amateur, a dilettante,"" until Marlee proves that she really can hijack the jury. Cue the pledge of allegiance and the lunching with the judge and poor Nora Dunn and so on...

On the surface, RUNAWAY JURY is a highly charged courtroom drama. But there are very fun elements of the con peppered in. The main conflict is the cat & mouse games that Fitch and Marlee engage in. Marlee is our prohibitive ""protagonist,"" along with the perceptive Juror #9, Nick Easter (John Cusack), whom Fitch scornfully labels as a ""song and dance man."" But then Nick Easter begins to influence the panel. Now, there was a danger that viewers might have regarded these two, Marlee and Nick, as too cold and manipulative, except that there are enough humanizing moments in which they reveal vulnerability and remorse. You end up pulling for them. Even if their true motivations aren't made clear until the film's just about done. But Cusack and Weisz have always been very appealing actors. And, for this story to work, it's crucial that they appeal to you.

Powerhouse acting all over the motherfrogging place. It's a hell of a cast. You know a movie is just showing off when it's got folks like Jennifer Beals and Dylan McDermott walking in for, essentially, extended cameos. Gene Hackman, predatory gleam in his eye, steals all the scenes, even in his one and only talking scene with Dustin Hoffman (who's pretty good himself). The story gives you red herrings to sift thru. Bits of humor occasionally lighten the mood. But mostly you're riding on that suspenseful wave, wondering if Marlee and Nick can pull it off and cheering each time Rankin Fitch, that fink, would get egg on his face. We won't get into the fact that Marlee and Nick, by what they've set out to do, are thumbing their noses at the process of law. But they're likable rogues. Those are the sort who get away with murder.

1971059,2,B00014NF02,"When you have a cast like this (Hackman, Cusack, Hoffman, Wiesz, Beals, Dunn and many more), and base your movie on a top author like Grisham, you should be able to come up with something better than this. All the cast are good in their roles, especially Hackman as the jury fixer. Given this, one would expect a movie that is well liked and successful. What happened?
They decided to make a ""message"" movie changing the villains in the book from the tobacco industry to the gun industry. Some people may not like that but personally, I'm okay with the film's message that maybe some really powerful weapons shouldn't be so easily available. The way they make the case for their message is just embarrassing and completely one sided.
Everyone associated with the pro-gun side, whether it be the many attorneys, gun company execs, jurors on their side are all presented as totally evil people who will break every law in the book and will stop at nothing to win their case. While Dustin Hoffman and the other gun control characters are presented as heroic and above trying to buy a jury or break any laws.

1971062,5,B00014NF02,"John Grisham is a pretty pungent thriller writer but in this case he wrote a beautiful fairy tale. At least the ending is a fairy tale.

But the object is not the ending. The object is to expose the gun business as what it is a death-monger. Second amendment or no second amendment, that's not the real stake of the gun industry. Their stake is to use the constitution to make as much money as possible without considering the number of collateral or non-collateral victims the use of the guns they sell may cause. And what's more they cannot be attacked the way the tobacco industry was because no one can pretend the gun industry is lying about the real effect of guns. Their real effect is to kill other people than those who use them and there is no lying on the merchandise either: it does just what they promise.

So they are untouchable, except through justice, and eventually a popular jury: for once the justice of the people for the people by the people. But it takes a lot of effort and force to manage that against all those who believe in the sacred right for every American citizen to shoot someone who is offending them and of course then to regret the pain these deaths may cause to the survivors.

But here the film is not giving any kind of argument against the gun industry. It is just showing how that industry and their lawyers manage to make justice lean their way by harassing the members of the jury, by buying the witnesses of the defense, by intimidating anyone who is against them, or even by trying to buy an insider in the jury to deliver them the proper verdict. But it may all fail if...

And that's just the rub in that situation. There is so far no ""if"" about it. The gun industry will win any trial of the sort. Macdonald may lose a trial in the accusation of making people obese, just like the tobacco industry lost their trials one after the other, about lung cancer and other tobacco induced cancers. But it is impossible to imagine a jury bringing back a guilty verdict as long as the decision will have to be unanimous. There will always be a die-hard constitutionalist who will hang the jury to a non-decision.

But the film is well done and interesting and New Orleans is a beautiful city, especially before hurricane Katrina. You will recognize some squares, buildings and streets and you will even have some soft Cajun or Creole voodoo, and of course the streetcars, named desire or not. And that's why this film is slightly more than just one more plain court film or trial film or whatever having to deal with the blind lady, that is so blind that she does not see crimes and certainly not criminals. Apparently the second amendment is an obligation for her and it has to be the total freedom for anyone to carry guns and use them for self defense, or at least what they call self defense, or to kill a caribou like Ms. Palin.

Apparently she is not that keen on reading the first amendment too much that protects the freedom of expression, speech and the press, and any Wikileaks becomes a public enemy number 1 as soon as it touches the family jewels of the federal crown of the United States. It is true it is a lot easier than during the Vietnam war to get secret documents with the Internet today. No more photocopies, man, actually no more hard copies, man.

Try to understand what's wrong with this world. This film answers a little bit. What is wrong with this world is that people are afraid of the end of the world, of the snow that is falling like hell in Europe right now, of the possible loss of what they have not earned since it was the product of financial speculations, like the thirteenth and fourteenth months of salary in Greece. We will lose a lot of things if we do not work hard to produce more, because we will have to share every single cent we make with those we have exploited for millennia and who want to have a good share of the cake today: China, India, Brazil, Latin America, Africa, Central America and many others.

So maybe we should start thinking that in a dangerous world the second amendment is not the solution, but the first amendment might very well be. And the countries that are emerging in this world today do not need American weapons to succeed. They just need good economic management, good economic lawyers and the steady patience of working like hell to achieve their aim, and God knows they are close to it.

With a cast hitting on all cylinders, RUNAWAY JURY is a white-knuckle suspense joy ride; I haven't had this much fun watching a legal beagle movie since seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Verdict/dp/B000O77SPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Verdict</a>&nbsp;(equally implausible but replete with nonstop, racing suspense).

Instead of Grisham's novel about a lawsuit against big tobacco, the villains in this thriller are the gun manufacturers.  And they are being sued by the widow of a gun shooting victim to be held accountable for making. . .guns.  (No, I didn't make this up.)  To insure victory, the gun manufacturers conspire and hire a mean hombre named Rankin Fitch (a scowling Gene Hackman) to tamper with the jury; what Fitch doesn't take into account is the jury has been infiltrated by a con man (John Cusack), and a player on the outside (Rachel Weisz, wolf howl).  And the game board is set:  either Fitch opposes Cusack's character to prevail with the jury, or allies himself with him--for a hefty price.

The actors, in a word, are terrific.  Hackman, Cusack, and Weisz are on their A Games, as is Dustin Hoffman, playing the moralistic attorney for the plaintiff.  But I was also greatly impressed with all the cast, including Bruce McGill, Jeremy Piven, Jennifer Beals, Gerry Bamman, and Luis Guzman.  The interaction inside the jury room is spellbinding and grand fun to watch.  The ending is predictable--the true motivation for Weisz and Cusack's characters totally lame--yet that fails to take away from the pulse-pounding suspense of RUNAWAY JURY.

Cut to two years later and the wife and her attorney Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) are hoping to make history by making the gun company that sold and manufactured the murder weapon liable for the crime. Since this has never before been attempted the gun company hire a little extra protection in the menacing form of Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman). For the right price he can handpick twelve people that will be easily exploited into voting whichever way his employers want. The only juror who stands out is Nick Easter (John Cusack). He is a rebel who initially frustrates and confuses Fitch but soon both Rohr and Fitch realize that Easter is crucial to their cause. He has the power to get his fellow jurors to follow his lead whether it be picking a blind man to be the jury foreman or pledging allegiance in court to remember a dead comrade. Easter along with his girlfriend, the mysterious Marlee (Rachel Weisz), have their own reasons for seeing that the right person pays for the crime. Together the two offer to sell to either Fitch or Rohr the jury for $50,000.

1971071,4,B00014NF02,"I have no idea whether juries in the real world can be corrupted as this jury in the reel world is, but ""Runaway Jury"" is a riveting thriller that ought to capture the interest of the viewer from beginning to end, whether one buys into all the plot points or not.

Its success as a genre-film derives from the superlative cast, which is headed by Dustin Hoffman in the role of the honest but savvily down-to-earth attorney (with shabby suit and a carefully planted mustard dab on his tie) who is suing the big gun companies on behalf of the wife of a victim of a mass murder; and Gene Hackman as the ruthless (and expensively dressed) jury consultant, who does not give a fig for the victims, but merely wants to win big on behalf of his even bigger clients, no matter how low he has to stoop to do it. Hoffman and Hackman are supported ably by John Cusack and Rachel Weisz, both of whose characters have hidden agendas.

Although the film is worth watching for its suspense-factor alone, the performances of Hoffman and Hackman, who confront each other in the old-fashioned wood-paneled men's washroom of the court, lift ""Runaway Jury"" from the level of a conventional court-room thriller. This scene, which lasts several minutes, allows these two cinematic masters to pull out all the stops, as it were, of their craft. It is so rare nowadays to get a full-blown scene--more reminiscent of one in a stage play--between two actors of their calibre.

The settings of pre-Katrina New Orleans--the French Quarter and the Garden District--also contribute to the film's ambience.

Every once and a while, I sit down and watch the DVD of a film that I missed in the theatre the first time around. Many, I pass on to my friends; ""Runaway Jury,"" I did not.",1222041600,2,1749,4.632258064516129
1971072,4,B00014NF02,"Because of the fact that Dustin Hoffman plays the attorney for the Plaintiff in a wrongful death lawsuit (her husband, an attorney; Dylan McDermot - short cameo at beginning of movie) against a gun manufacturer; he does [mostly] everything by the book. So it's easy to somehow gloss over his character, since he comes across as the knight in shining armor for all the people who's loved ones have died due to handgun violence.

Gene Hackman on the other hand, is the scheming, conniving, cold and calculating Rankin Fitch; the jury consultant for the gun manufacturer attorneys. It's easy for his character to be more dominating in the film, as he weaves some pretty evil, unscrupulous, coercive manipulations and intimidation of jury-influencing and tampering. And he has at his command, a plethora of seemingly callous ""technicians"" (automatons) to assist him. With one of his techs, a real scumbag, ""get-it-done no matter what"" type (i.e. via physical violence, if need be). Oh, he gets his just desserts from Wiesz (so I spoiled some of it - so what).

All the while John Cusak as Juror #9; Nick Easter and his cohort in ""jury-tampering"" Rachel Wiesz; Marlee, worked their side in the manipulation (a.k.a Blackmail) of both the Plaintiff and Defendant attorneys to swing the verdict in one or the others favor (for money, of course). Cusak seemingly manipulates part of the jury, but in the end he knows that they'll decide on their on account. Nick, being on the inside, with the Jury. Marlee, on the outside working the attorneys.

A surprise ending (though not really unpredictable), in which Hackman really gets it ""stuck to him"".  He never knew what hit him. The real surprise is how Nick (Cusak) and Marlee (Weisz) screw Hackman (Fitch) while they come out smelling like roses (a little richer, and a little worse for wear) for their efforts; although still legally immoral. But not to them. They've played this game before.",1219622400,,1934,4.923312883435583
1971073,1,B00014NF02,"In full disclosure, I am adamantly pro-gun and believe that gun control kills far more people than gun legalization. Residents of high-gun crime, ""gun-free"" Washington DC, or students in the ""gun free zones"" of Virginia Tech, Columbine High School, etc. have experienced firsthand why a disarmed populace is at greater risk of gun violence. Banning guns will only make the black market for guns go through the ceiling, and the only people who will have guns who aren't police or military will be those who are willing to break the law to possess them, as banning drugs hasn't made them disappear either. If guns weren't manufactured domestically, there would still be millions of guns floating around, even ignoring international manufacturers - the black market and the criminal underworld would thrive off of guns being banned. That also means a criminal can rob your house, harm your family, etc. knowing that you won't have a convenient means of self-defense. My point is GUN CONTROL IS NOT LOGICAL.

This is not an editorial forum and I will no longer expound upon my political beliefs, but this movie ""The Runaway Jury"" is very much an editorial movie, and it uses fiction to go into realms of fantasy and fallacy where they don't even have to deal with real world facts and logic when making their point. They set up a convenient counter-balance where the noble gun control lawyer (Hoffman) refuses to compromise his principles and give into blackmail vs. the ruthless corporate bigwigs and their evil jury selecter (Hackman) who will win by hook or by crook, robbing and burning apartments, blackmailing jurors, etc. This is a huge strawman fallacy, which enables them to manipulate the movie audience because we are not remotely sympathetic to the evil gun lobby and especially to Hackman. It ignores the fact that Hoffman winning this case would make the sky rain money for gun control lawyers, and indicates that the gun control groups and their representatives are pure in their intentions while the gun lobby is motivated purely by greed.

Because of this manipulation, we easily miss many failures in elementary logic.

1.) The defense lawyer would have been the worst defense lawyer in the world from the little we see of him. There are many angles he could have taken - for instance, ""had even one employee at the company had a concealed firearm made by the gun manufacturer, the killer could have been stopped dead in his tracks. The plaintiff's husband might still be alive today."" Or what about ""there is zero way for any company, regardless of industry, to control how their product is misused or resold by anyone other than the company themselves."" The movie briefly mentioned that the gun company had no influence over the illegal resale of their weapon, but that was a minor bone thrown only to keep the tension of the plaintiff losing in the plot instead of something that was fleshed out as the core argument by the defense. We hardly even hear any logical arguments from the defense, maybe because  the writers decided that they could hurt their point. Instead, in the trial, we see a.) the gun company has paid for a vacation for the guy who legally sold the gun to the guy who illegally sold the gun to the guy who killed the plaintiff's husband (that's the primary argument or the industry's ""complicity"" by the prosecution...really...) b.) the gun lobby has through probably devious means somehow managed to make the prosecution's witness not show up in court. c.) a hapless gun executive who can't make logical arguments to defend his product other then screaming about standing for the 2nd Amendment and d.) hardly any arguments from the defense, and when they were there, they were usually unconvincing.

2.) Why would a jury member be able to win over with niceness jurors who have been ruthlessly blackmailed by the ""evil"" gun lobby? Surely the adulteress under the threat of having her adultery revealed, the AIDS-diagnosed guy who had been threatened that his secret would become public, and the lady who was told to either side with the gun lobby or her husband will go to jail for life for bribery are going to suddenly side against the gun lobby because John Cusack was buddy-buddy with them? That was conveniently set up to make the gun lobby look evil, but was conveniently ignored in deliberations when they somehow forgot about the blackmail.

3.) If Hackman's character was an even remotely talented jury selecter, surely he would have picked more than two jurors who see the illogic in such a frivolous lawsuit. All he needed was five and the prosecution's case fails. But most of the jurors were already against the gun lobby before Cusack even opened his mouth. Once he did, they were able to deliberate with very little debate, despite the fact that they all knew the immense gravity of their decision, they called for a vote without a thorough fleshing out of the pros and cons. The niceness of Cusack's character to the other jurors isn't suddenly going to make the other jurors change their worldview on guns, basic logic, etc.

4.) And I guess the two masterminds aren't going to get ramrodded by the IRS when they donate $15 million from an account in the Cayman Islands to their poor town that went broke from engaging in a similar frivilous lawsuit against the gun industry?

These are just a few of the many bizarre leaps of faith and logical missteps that, in their ineptness, reveal the true agenda of the movie. The writers take a side, draw the audience to their side via careful manipulation, omit any real dissenting arguments, turn the opponents into the strawmen that they want them to be pigeonholed as, has the ideal outcome which is connotated as heroic and see sweet revenge against the ""bad guys"" (whom we have no sympathy to as viewers).

Luckily this is ineptly done and blatant to us gun control opponents, but I worry that some fencesitters on the issue would take the movie as-is and assume that this is really what the debate is all about - the evil, ruthless greed-driven gun lobby vs. the honest, decent gun control movement. Please see through the facade, or better yet, don't waste your time. The producers should have just stuck with the much better and more logical storyline in the book instead of trying to make it into a semi-thriller (by changing the subject from tobacco to guns) and going political in a biased way that will only anger at least half the audience.",1219190400,5,6451,4.8045045045045045

1971082,4,B00014NF02,"Another John Grisham thriller is churned out as a star studded movie.  It seems the books with the most thrills have been taken, as this is somewhat pedestrian, although still entertaining.

So what's it about? A big trial against the gun manufacturers is in progress, and both sides are anxious to have the jury on their side.  The gun manufacturers hire Gene Hackman, representing the dark corporate side of jury manipulation.  However, the apple-cart is upturned when it turns out that the jury is already being manipulated and may be for sale, engineered by someone on the jury and an accomplice (Weisz).

The collection of stars is fantastic - Hackman, Hoffman, Cusack, Weisz.  In fact, as the interesting extras point out, Hackman and Hoffman have never shared screen time before.  Seeing them in their one big screen moment together is the highlight of the movie.  Hackman does not quite bring the same complexity to the role as he did to his other Grisham movie, `The Firm', but he lends real gravitas to his unscrupulous jury consultant.  Hoffman is unusually restrained for the most part to play a convincing attorney, but it's Cusack once again who shows himself as a truly natural talent, morphing into just about any role he is given with ease.  Here, the entertainment is in watching him manipulate the jury with some applied psychology, while his own motivation remains obscured until a time of his choosing.

Most of the movie is a bidding war and cat and mouse game, until the final denouement unveils the true motivation in a reasonably satisfying way.  Along the way, the thriller elements seem shoehorned in, with the real joy in watching the process of choosing and manipulating the jury - the indictment of the system the movie is aiming at.

It's a solid enough story, and well told - but somehow you get the feeling the source material was never as cinematic as Grisham's previous movie adaptations.  The cast and acting, especially by Hackman and Cusack, make this worthwhile.  For legal thriller buffs, it won't disappoint, but it's not the real classic it might have been.

Cusack is equally cast and performs admirably as the juror with a motive who ends up having the tale revolve around.

It unfolds slowly, suspensively with snippets of past events flashed at the right moments to reveal just enough and keep enough still in doubt.

Having just served on jury, this is fascinating stuff.  Wonder two things: how true to book?  how true to civil Louisiana trials? In any case, for viewing this is riveting tale with sophisticated technology, body language experts, and feasting upon human behavior at its weakest.

1971086,4,B00014NF02,"This is an exciting and entertaining thriller, which has been marketed as an expose of jury tampering. However, the storyline also has a very strong position on the manufacture and sale of guns.

The film is not so much pro gun-control propaganda as a story which takes completely for granted that the advocates of that postion are the side of good and the opponents are in the wrong. It appears to assume that everyone associated with the firearms industry is corrupt and evil, and that all those involved at any stage of assembly or distribution in supplying a weapon which is then used by a murderer are as much to blame for his actions as he is. If you strongly disagree with that opinion, then unless you can suspend your views while watching the film you will not enjoy it.

My own views are considerably more sympathetic to gun control than polls suggest the average American to be, and even so I had to think myself into a much harder line anti-gun position than I actually hold in order to enjoy ""Runaway Jury"". This film could almost have been called ""Bowling for Columbine II.""

Having said all that, it is a gripping story. The film begins with the father of a little boy celebrating his son's sixth birthday before going to work, where he is shot dead when a recently sacked colleague returns to his former office with an assault rifle and kills a large number of his former co-workers before turning the gun on himself. Then the film jumps on two years to jury selection in the case which the widow is bringing against the manufacturer of the weapon with which her husband was murdered.

Dustin Hoffman plays the local lawyer who represents the widow: he is assisted by a big-city expert on jury selection who joins the team for 30% of his usual fee because of his opposition to firearms. On the other side, Gene Hackman plays Rankin Fitch, a ruthless and unscrupulous expert on jury selection (and jury tampering) who is retained by the arms industry.

John Cusack plays Nick Easter, a member of the jury who with his girlfriend Marlie (Rachel Weisz) appears to be conspiring to sell the verdict to the highest bidder. But is that really what they are doing? And to what length will the arms industry go to get the result they want?

Much of the acting is first rate, especially by Hoffman, Hackman, Cusack, and Weisz. The tension of the story develops well, and the twist with which the film ends is very clever.

If you like thrillers and good acting, and either take the Michael Moore approach to guns or can put any alternative view aside for 122 minutes, you will almost certainly enjoy this film. If you're a member of the NRA or work for a firearms manufacturer, you should probably give it a miss.",1169251200,,2720,4.584362139917696

1971094,3,B00014NF02,"This is a reasonably entertaining movie with some pretty good acting but its more suspense and drama than action. If you're looking for a thriller with things blowing up and shoot-outs and high speed car chases you'll be disappointed. Its a bit slow toward the beginning and gradually builds up throughout the film and reaches a surprising climax at the end. However, it does remain entertaining throughout for the most part.

A lot of people see this as a liberal Hollywood political statement whereby the anti-gun plaintiffs are cast as the good guys and the gun company cast as the bad guys. But its really unfortunate if people go away from this film thinking that. A real argument for gun control would take the form of a documentary or a book, not a movie. This film doesn't provide many complicated arguments for gun control besides a few summary statistics that are not in question.

What it does instead is take a generic issue-in this case it's gun control but it could be anything- which sets up a populist ""people against the powerful"" or analogously ""good versus evil"" dichotomy. On the one side there is the cynical Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman) who has no conscience and seems to exist only for power and glory. He's portrayed as a corroded, self-destructive character but extremely powerful because of his lack of scruples. On the other hand there is the naive moralist crusader in prosecuting attorney Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman), who wants to do the right thing but can't win the case because he's too principled. He believes in the justice system (symbolized by a statue of blind lady justice) but doesn't realize the system is fundamentally corrupted. He'd rather lose the case than subvert the system, because in his mind the ends do not justify the means. What this means is that justice is never truly achieved. But what about the victims who suffer personally from the loss of justice? And what is really the right balance in navigating the thin line between the ends and the means? That is truly the factor X in this film. Look for the metaphors and allegories that pop up from time to time.

This movie truly did not have to be about guns. It could have been about any issue, any form of injustice, real or perceived. I'm afraid many people will simply look at this as a gun movie and the one-sided focus on a hot button political issue has ruined the potential appreciation in the deeper themes. That's because as Rankin Fitch knows, most movie viewers, like jurors, are not ""King Solomon,"" but just people who see the action and take in the political slant. There is always a reward for those who look deeper.",1144972800,4,2637,4.7158351409978305

I also wasn't bothered by far-fetched elements of the plot, any more than I was while watching House of Flying Daggers.

The movie worked for me because the characters were interesting, if romantically drawn, heroes and villains. One of the best parts of the movie was watching Rachel Weisz as Marlee, a character of strength and vulnerability that was so satisfying that it was worth the sometimes unrealistic plot devices instrumental in her creation. The same for Gene Hackman as Rankin Fitch and John Cusak as Nicholas Easter.

The trial subject matter changed between the two mediums (a smoking trial in the novel and a gun trial in the movie version), but the theme was the same-a wounded ""little guy"" suing arrogant corporate interests.  The movie isn't really about the trial, or the merits of the arguments, and the lawyers are in the periphery to the action.  The two true players are Gene Hackman, a high-paid jury consultant for the gunmaker, and John Cusack, a little guy who worked hard to get on this jury and has a few tricks up his sleeve.  This is a movie about psychological influence, and elements of the book are represented, but unfortunately, it wasn't possible to capture the masterpiece of psychological trickery that was played by the two sides in the book.  It's a decent action flick, and fairly true to the story, but it falls short of being complete.  I was especially disappointed by the ending.

The movie opened with a deranged day trader opening fire on his stockbroker's office.  Since the book has no no day traders, mass murders, or even the crime, I knew I was in for a different movie than I expected.  That said, I think the movie was truthful to the spirit of the novel with the exception of the details in the ending.  Speaking of the ending, I found that the energy and suspense were great and then the last five minutes were a let down.  Two people clever enough to cause these events would have shown more class/creativity than they did in the movie.  The book wins this part of the race hands down!

This movie did a great job of making us care about the plaintiff without having to slow down the story to show much of her.  I know it is strange, but part of the brilliance of this story is that, even though it is a trial, the plaintiff and the defendant are minor characters!

Gene Hackman was great as usual, and I thought that Dustin Hoffman did a great job with a lighter character.  The special features make a huge deal about this being their first meeting in a scene together.  The rest of the acting was decidedly 3 stars, not horrible yet not inspiring either.

Overall, I would recommend that, if this is your type of movie, that you see it.  This is not good enough to coerce a date or anyone else that is reluctant to see, though.

1971102,5,B00014NF02,"I remember seeing Runaway Jury in theaters in 2003, and was just in awe after leaving the theater. The movie is precisely accurate and perfect in every sense of the word.

As much as he was the 'bad guy' in the film, wow..I couldn't help but love Genes character. He was always dressed to the nines and looking 100% confident.

As for John Cusacks character, I personally don't think I could've loved this movie near as much if someone else had've played the role. He was absolutely perfect for it. Same for Rachel Weisz. Gary Fleder made NO mistakes in choosing every actor for this movie. In my opinion, nobody was replaceable, everyone was absolutely perfect for the role they played.

1971103,1,B00014NF02,"How much you will ridicule this movie depends mainly on your background, and whether you have much if any experience with the legal system, or if you are the kind that thinks People Magazine is worthwhile reading material outside of a waiting room environment.

In typical John Grisham fashion, the characters are one-dimensional cardboard props less complex or insightful than a calendar, the conflict is a one-sided strident advocacy that cartoonishly portrays any views outside its own as being morally and intellectually bereft, and the level of cerebral involvement is geared down heavily for the soap opera fan demographic it's intended for (which is slightly below that of a well-trained rescue animal or seeing-eye dog). What makes this the most banal and absurd of John Grisham's adaptations to date (and that's saying something), is the utter and abject lapses of plausible premise and its detachment from grown-up reality.

Don't get me wrong - as an avid movie fan who has seen hundreds (if not thousands) of movies, I am all for creative license and the occasional departure from strict reality-based storytelling. Rilly! But Grisham's claim to fame is his legal background, and for someone who takes himself so seriously as a legal professional and novelist, it's asking a little too much to expect esteem and praise for this absurd amalgam of soap opera /soft-minded editorializing rant/ unintentional self-satire.

In fairness, I did not read the book, and am not commenting on that since I'm not sure how much of the blame falls on the book, and how much of this is due to the vapid screenplay. But I did watch the movie. And having served that sentence, I have earned the right to comment on its sheer absurdity.

Rather than give a detailed treatment of the story, I will summarize its plot and remarkable foibles. WARNING: SPOILER TO FOLLOW (although you probably could have figured out the ""twist"" very early in the film.) John Cusack is a con artist who gets ""selected"" on juries throughout the country for the purpose of swinging a jury towards a verdict by persuading all of its members. His plan is to extract payment through a mixture of extortion and auctioneering, as carried out by his partner (Rachel Weisz). How does he expect to control a verdict's outcome? By applying his limited charm, which is repeatedly but unconvincingly demonstrated through the trial. Smart (or at least semi-lucid) people realize the odds of being selected for a jury are VERY low even if you live in a small town. They are infinitesimal if you are in large cities, where Cusack's character repeatedly plies his trade. It is also probably understood that the notion of someone predictably influencing a jury is perhaps plausible if threats of violence are involved rather than Cusack's marginal charisma. And not least of all is the part where his identity and scheme are discovered by the defense team, though not soon after blatantly drawing attention to himself by pissing off the judge. Yet, the defense says nothing about this multiple-felony conduct which could effect the trial for a lot less money than the $10Million being demanded.

How does the story handle this Marianas Trench-sized gap in logic? By replacing its characters with one-dimensional caricatures that embody virtue or avarice (depending on where they philosophically fall in this heavily slanted editorial piece) and who guide the film to its outcome with all the validity and credibility of a Ouija board.

Finally, the defendant's legal team utilizes a level of ultra- (no, make that hyper-) sophisticated real-time surveillance and research resources. Their whole case is anchored around a jury expert (Gene Hackman) and his team of cyber whizzes and shady operatives who capriciously resort to violence and vandalism. It is an unhinged conspiracy buff's paranoid fantasy. The least important member of the legal team is the attorney - I kid you not! If our government had these assets, we would win both the wars against drugs and terrorism faster than this excremental movie went straight to the rental shelf.

As ludicrous as all the other facets of this movie are, the weakest may be the ending, which reveals Cusack&Weisz's connection to the case a decade earlier. With all the omniscience at their disposal, the defense team doesn't solve this monochromatic Rubic's cube until after the predictable and inane verdict is rendered.

Our legal system is a remarkable thing. It is fascinating in its principles and premise, though less entertaining in its application. The writers have taken some ridiculous liberties in the far-fetched and FAILED attempt to make it an engaging and interesting story. That is their job and indeed their right to do so. I just do not think something so slapdash and inferior should be lauded or rewarded.",1127001600,14,4825,5.060377358490566
1971104,2,B00014NF02,"I have been a staunch fan of Gary Fleder ever since ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"", but after seeing ""I'll Never Tell"" and this piece of sanctimonious, biased trash, my enthusiasm for him is waning.

I watch movies for entertainment. I resent it when movie makers use the venue to browbeat me with their social and political viewpoint, especially when they are sneaky about their motives. Movies like ""Fahrenheit 911"" are open and honest about their intentions...if you go, you KNOW what to expect, but movies like ""Runaway Jury"" and ""The China Syndrome"" are not. You buy/rent/watch for entertainment, but instead are subjected to the totally biased, often inaccurate opinions and viewpoints of the moviemakers. They lure you in with the promise of entertainment and then bury you with their biased dogma. I seem to recall that a number of Hollywood notables promised to leave the country if political events didn't go their way....instead, they stayed home and made movies like this.

The original (and infinitely superior) story was based on ""Big Tobacco"" companies and the callous tactics they use to hook new smokers and maximize profit without concern for the 300,000 deaths their addictive product causes every year. I think everyone agrees that they are cads....their product, even when properly used, is lethal. They lied, they concealed facts, and they lost their case. But since smoking has been thoroughly discredited, the Hollywood liberals decided to modify this story and use it as their soapbox to present a case against another pet peeve of theirs: the private ownership of firearms. In their minds, murderers are not solely responsible for their crimes....everyone from the manufacturer of the car they drove to the crime, to the manufacturer of the weapon (gun, knife, baseball bat, etc.) they used also share in the blame. It should be noted that collateral guilt is always directed at unsympathetic, wealthy organizations that can easily be attacked for huge financial settlements....no guilt is ever attached to the poor taxi driver who drove the murderer to the scene of the crime.

To further their biased cause, in this screed, the firearm manufacturers (i.e. ""villains"") are depicted as slimy, hateful weasles who blythely ignore (indeed, celebrate) the illegal use of their product for evil, unintended purposes as long as the cash keeps flowing in. To escape responsibility for their ""terrible crimes"", they resort to an arrogant, cunning reptile (Gene Hackman) to help them thwart justice and rig the jury in their favor. Never mind that, to date, every jury that has heard this argument has rejected it....without ""rigging"".

A disgruntled former employee of an investment firm has purchased a firearm manufactured by the defendant's company and has used it to murder several co-workers before committing suicide. Since the murderer is not available to pay for his crime, or even if he were, it is obvious (to the liberal mindset) that the (wealthy) original manufacturer of the tool used in the crime must also pay....and pay big. Predictably,  the ability to pay a huge settlement seems to be the primary criteria for attack.

Naturally, the poor, innocent, lovely plaintiff and her honest, underdog attorney (Dustin Hoffman), are depicted as honorable angels, just trying to set things right (and, of course, make a hundred million or so dollars in the process). The entire presentation is so blatantly biased that there is absolutely no doubt who will win the case....there is NO suspense. This is NOT a mystery or a drama, it is a political statement by a group of confused individuals who do not believe in personal responsibility or freedom of choice....unless of course the choice is one with which they agree.

There is no denying that the movie is well directed, the acting is generally excellent, and the cinematography is superb (hence the 2 stars instead of zero)...but zealots are always most convincing when they have a personal stake in the message.

Gary, my man, quit wasting your great skills on lousy, biased stories and get back to making exciting, entertaining movies...and Hollywood, quit taking yourselves so seriously. You tend to be a bunch of egotistical, opinionated clowns who should keep your politics to yourselves and stick to your one, true talent...entertaining those who pay your bills.",1126656000,14,4361,5.141043723554302

1971106,1,B00014NF02,"I'm no supporter of the rights of gun makers or owners, corporate welfare or the industrial revolution in litigation.  That said, I felt like I needed a long shower after watching this flick - utterly redolent in almost toxic Hollywood-style self-righteousness in a slickly manipulative wrapper.  Supposedly a legal confrontation between the gun industry and the victims of gun violence, it's really a showdown between an impassioned attorney for the victims played by Hoffman, and a skilled litigation consultant played by Hackman who picks juries from an ad-hoc control of the kind probably used in ""Desert Storm"".  Between the two are John Cusak as one of the jurors, and Rachel Weisz as a mystery woman who claims she can deliver the jury to the side that pays the most.

This probably could have made either an effective legal thriller, or a great message movie - but not both.  Unfortunately, Hollywood never avoids the cake-and-eat-it-to route, in which a message movie and a thriller are conflated into a single story that gives little room for either to effectively develop.  A promising tale - one that would explore the sophisticated issue of corporate ethics and industrial liability versus our national obsession with suing everybody and responsibility avoidance - is edged out by a parallel story in which Rachel Weisz plays cat-and-mouse with Hackman's evil jury consultant.  The less-promising tale - in which Weisz maneuvers between Hackman and Hoffman - would have provided some cool thrills, if not sandwiched between the preachy rhetoric of the trial.  The stories detract rather than compliment each other.  The thriller is never convincing because the idea of Weisz playing each side against the other never takes hold - the flick so openly wears its lawyer/gun-industry animus on its sleeve that we know from the first shot which side is really in her sights.  I'm all for gun-control, whether the industry is manned by everyday people representing a social, economic or racial cross-section of America, or by a closed cabal of white, god-fearing patriarchal men with southern accents like those in this movie.  The movie's message: we know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and if you just use your heart, you'll see things the way we do.

The story was originally aimed at the tobacco industry, supposedly to avoid confusion with the more effective ""The Insider"", and not because cigarettes are more popular on both sides of the screen than guns are.  On second thought, I'm willing to accept that - the flick was reasonably aware of its weaknesses.  Unfortunately, there's no effective lobby for bad-movie control.  This isn't because Hollywood is nicer or otherwise better or than the gun industry, just comparatively harmless.  Both are easily guilty for playing with the truth for a profit, but in the end one of them leaves us with an oft-painful reality that we then have to live with, while the other leaves us with fantasies no more costly than rising ticket prices and $5 buckets of popcorn.",1121385600,8,3039,5.01192842942346

Of course, this flick is a total propaganda screed for the anti-gun lobby. It hardly pretends to present a balanced portrait of the gun debate. The evil characters are portrayed by Gene Hackman, the jury consultant for the gun lobby, and the greedy gun makers themselves. Okay, boys and girls, cartoon time! Dustin Hoffman plays the principled lawyer attempting to extract $100 million from the gun companies for his client. Oh, yeah, right! It's about crippling the gun industry, not about lining the pockets of attorneys and clients. Yep, sure! But, putting aside the blatant political bias of RUNAWAY JURY, I liked this movie -- until the last ten minutes when it became a hollow echo of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE -- because of the strong direction of Gary Fleder and the tight script and the excellent cinematograhy plus super performances by Hackman and John Cusack who plays the runaway juror.

Dramatic license does not even come close to describing the liberties the filmmaker took. The book dealt w/ big tobacco but, apparently, the screenwriter/director had an anti-gun axe to grind and substituted big tobacco w/ the firearm industry instead.

Needless to say I was very disappointed. Good performances by Gene Hackman and Bruce McGill; otherwise, a thoroughly forgettable film. Borrow the book from the library and save yourself the $9.00.",1104364800,10,662,4.901785714285714

1971113,4,B00014NF02,"From its stunning opening scene of a workplace shooting, director Gary Fleder manipulates the viewer's perceptions and keeps the suspense high.  When attorney Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) represents the wife of the victim in a suit against the gun manufacturer two years later, he comes up against Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman), a jury consultant hired by Vicksburg Firearms Company to give them a sympathetic jury.  One member of the jury pool, Nicholas Easter (John Cusack) may hold the key to the outcome, but whether he is acting honorably or is himself a tool of special interests is not clear at the outset.

Based on John Grisham's novel of the same name, the screenplay by Brian Koppelman, David Levein, Rick Cleveland, and Matthew Chapman focuses on the issue of jury consultants, including their secret rooms to process photographs and information about jury members, detectives and hired thugs who gather incriminating information for them (""Everyone has a secret they don't want you to find""), surreptitious break-ins, and blackmail used against jurors.  Hackman is unscrupulous as the pawn of the gun manufacturer, Hoffman is earnest but far less forceful as plaintiff's attorney, and Cusack is a mystery man whose goal on the jury is not quite clear until late in the film.  A supporting cast including Rachel Weisz as Cusack's girl friend/co-conspirator Marlee is effective in maintaining the suspense and keeping the motivation of Easter and herself a mystery.

Though the film is unrealistic regarding jury procedure and regulations, the fact that the viewer still maintains high interest in it attests to the strength of the acting and the effectiveness of the writing in getting the viewer to ""suspend disbelief.""  The many scenes filmed in half-light by cinematographer Robert Elswit help increase the tension and promote suspense.  Somewhat cynical in its depiction of the jury system and the ability of jury consultants to manipulate outcomes, the film features crosses and doublecrosses, evil men working to subvert justice (on commission), and blatant attempts to buy the jury.  Sensational, exciting, and filled with action scenes, this is a film with little subtlety but good entertainment value.  Mary Whipple",1100736000,,2235,5.305949008498583

The acting is great with Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman bringing there A game to a C level project but not even they can make this script work. Weisz and Hackman are great as adversaries outside the court room and Dustin Hoffman is great as the moral center of the film, but he does not have much screen time at all compared to the other actors in the film. John Cusack is decent but lacks a certain flare to pull off his role right, and a better actor I think would have done a better job in his role. His work pales in comparison to the other actors in the film and you can see that in the scenes he shares with them. I also did not believe in the way he was able to hold the jury in his hands when he seem more creepy than charming to them. We don't really see the jury much at all and certain plot points concerning them disappear after a short time. The direction is not very coherent and it flashes back and forth a little too much and certain scenes are cut way too short and certain scenes are way too long for their own good. I am giving high marks to the acting of Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman for at the very least keeping me from changing the channel but with a movie that has a script that is made out of Swiss, it's very hard to not change it",1099785600,8,1424,4.089285714285714
1971122,4,B00014NF02,"Personally, I'm a little befuddled with all the negative criticisms this movie has received. Although the movie lacks the appeal of a truly classic thriller, the cast is adequate and the premise, which is a commentary on the idea of possible corruption of the jury selection process and the ills of access to firearms, is truly what makes the film effective as a courtroom drama.

When a woman's husband is killed in a random office shooting, she sues the gun manufacturers and takes them to court. Dustin Hoffman does an excellent job in the role of the prosecuting lawyer who takes the case for this woman. He butts heads with Gene Hackman's character, and there is a gripping and poignant moment in which Hoffman delivers a great closing argument to the jury. Hackman, as usual, plays a scumbag who wants to pick the ultimate jury that will turn the case in the defense's favor. Hidden in a secret building, Hackman's team operates a system of tracking and following potential jurors using cameras and technology, playing a type of Big Brother of the jury system.

One of the ""wildcard"", or unpredictable jurors, is the one played by John Cusack. We follow the jury selection and case as it progresses, and there are a few more sneaky moves by Hackman's team to try to intimidate the other side. It gets a bit more complex when a woman who is working on the inside of the case comes into the picture.

The film really gets into the jury process and the corruption of this procedure, as well as the liability for manufacturers when disasters or tragedies strike. There is enough mystery in the film to keep the suspense going, and overall I felt that this was one of the best Grisham books made into a movie.",1099699200,3,1710,4.636963696369637

The whole high tech operation that is used for trying to get to the jury is way overblown and would have been over kill for any trail and the method behind some of the reasoning for the parties involved makes no sense once you put two and two together.  The script is over written in certain areas of the film and the dialog is not fully though out. The direction is a major problem as well because it does not give the actors enough time to finish they sentences before the camera cuts away. A better director would have giving the actors more time to fully give their characters a voice but in this film the director causes more harm than good by not letting them establish a rapport with the material at hand. The acting is good with great performances by Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz and Dustin Hoffman, which does the film more justice that the uneven script that they are working with and you can see it in their faces that they even think that the script is bad.  The only actor who does not rise above the material that is giving is John Cusack, which is really not his fault considering the fact that he has nothing to really work with. Even so, his tire performance is not really good and he's capable of doing much better work than what he has done here. He lacks the passion of the other actors (Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman) and he comes across as rank amateur next to each of them because of it. I think  a much better actor would have done more with the role than what Cusack did and would have at least tried his best to make the most of it. The film eventually gives up its hand a little too early and that's when things begin to fall apart. The actors are good enough for you to stay tune to what you are watching but eventually you yourself will fight the urge to tune out.

I will give a special nod to the effort made by Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman to rise above the lackluster materiel here in this film but the movie needed much more work in order for it to really keep me interested in what is going on.",1096156800,6,2117,4.245657568238213

1971141,2,B00014NF02,"Decent but very flawed film that has so many points to it that it can't be categorize in simply good or bad.

The Good: Some of the performances are spectacular and deserving of a much better movie than this. Gene Hackman hasn't been this good in ages, and he's one of the few reasons that this movie is watchable. The next reason is Rachel Weisz, who is the only actor Hackman has had in quite some time that is his equal in performance and in acting prowess.  She is so good in fact that she does almost steal the film from him and then some. The city of New Orleans is a fascinating setting for this film but wrong because it's not the original setting of the book.

The bad: Dustin Hoffman is not really in the movie and is really a minor character in the whole story. Which is too bad because he's such a charismatic actor and deserves a much bigger role than what he had. The next problem is the whole spy versus spy angle that makes the whole film into a joke because no one would go that far to rig a jury, especially in a case that would have been thrown out of court with the facts that was presented in the film. Which leads to....

The Ugly: The script is really bad. How bad you say? It took almost four writers to outline the story, which bare in mind does not follow the book at all. The dialog is great in places and bad in others, and the whole structure of the film is paper-thin which is easily to blow holes thru. The story runs out of gas in the half way point of the film and the ideas express seems more like a bias view of what the law should be than a realistic view of what the law really is. I think the biggest offence the movie makes is changing the text of the original novel and making about guns other than big tobacco. John Grisham's original novel was hugely entertaining and down right poignant in its views about justice. This film seems like it has not idea where it's at from time to time and lacks a coherent narrative to even try to explain the stuff that is going on right in front of you.

Even with the good points, the bad points does out weight the good here. It's a decent film because of the acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman but they like the viewer are let down with a script that lacks conviction for the subject it covers and a real point of view that expresses the feelings of the reality of the gun issue.",1095638400,7,2364,4.152838427947598

1971145,1,B00014NF02,"The whole purpose of this film is to push Hollywood's anti-gun agenda.  The film is well-acted, but the message, which is its only reason for existence, is to attack the firearms industry.  The industry is made out to be wealthy, and is using a corrupt jury expert (Gene Hackman) to blackmail and otherwise get control of the jury, which is, of course, a crime.

The hero (Dustin Hoffman) is trying to win a lawsuit against a firearms company, accused of selling ""assault weapons"" to the criminal element, so that the widow of a young broker who was killed by a disgruntled former employee, can benefit with a multi-million dollar settlement.

The evil Hackman, and also the upstanding Hoffman, are approached by a couple of young people who are offering, for $10 million, to swing the jury for them.  Hoffman, being an  honorable, law-abiding lawyer, refuses.  But the evil minion of the firearms industry (Hackman) agrees, of course, since he will stoop to anything.

Problems with the story: Every semi-automatic firearm is depicted as an ""assault"" weapon.  In fact, an actual assault weapon, as defined by the military, is capable of full automatic fire, as well as burst, and semi-automatic fire.  To own such a firearm, United States law requires a $200 license and an investigation of the licensee's character and past history.  Such a legally owned firearm has never been used in a crime in the United States.

Nor is the firearms industry composed of ""fat cats.""  Indeed, many of the companies have been driven into bankruptcy, and the remaining ones--famous manufacturers of some of our most historic firearms, like Colt and Smith & Wesson--have nearly been destroyed defending themselves against greedy lawyers, class action suits, and frivolous lawsuits brought by government bodies.  Left-wing Hollywood is fomenting such efforts.

Also ignored is that Second Amendment to the United Statesd Constitution, which permits all citizens to own and carry firearms.  The story line would penalize that right, illegally punishing the constitututionally protected firearms industry for selling perfectly legal devices designed for self-defense that function exactly as advertised, in good working order, because they were used for illegal purposes over which the manufacturer has no control.

Like sueing General Motors because one of its products, in good working order, was used in a hit-and-run, or as a getaway car in a bank robbery.

The firearms industry has, indeed, been sued a number of times by firearms haters.  They have never won such a case, however,  for the above reasons.  They continue to try, however, and it has cost the industry substantial amounts to protect itself from such frivolous lawsuits.

Oddly enough, Hollywood is heavily populated with people, including many top actors, who claim to hate firearms, and would like to disarm the United States' population.  Yet, it is a rare film that does not depict firearms violence by these very people, along with reckless driving episodes endangering the public--the obligatory car chase.  They ca't seem to make a film without such elements.  In this film, the figures given arguing that the deaths by gun violence are 30,000 a year, are grossly inflated and are pure Hollywood propaganda, and of course the National Rifle Association is singled out and comes in for its share of abuse.  You would never know that it was praised by the Presidents of the United States after both World Wars for its patriotic endeavors, and had as its president three Congressional Medal of Honor holders; not exacrly a subversive organization!

So, I am giving this film only one star, strictly on account of the propaganda and the agenda driven story.  The acting was certainly adequate, and the direction was not at fault.  But propaganda films do not rate higher, with me at least.  I was blind-sided.  I would never have bought the film had I known what they were pushing.  I'm sorry I did.

He charms his way though the jury's hearts and minds and holds the audience in his grips as well.

It is full of plot twists and turns, related to the premise of Jury manipulation that is carried out in a highly unrealistic manner.  That is the most significant flaw in this movie - that the whole scenario just couldn't happen, as anyone who has ever been called for jury duty would recognize.  That said, the story is captivating and you can't tell where the plot is leading until the end unless you've read the novel.  John Cusack, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and Rachel Weisz lead a stellar cast in a story that plays on empathy for victims of gun violence.  In my opinion, that is another flaw in the movie: that it caters to anti-gun interests by portraying a gun manufacturer as greedy, irresponsible, and callous.  It seems a bit sad that someone would become so obsessed with seeking ""justice"" after the shooting of someone close to them that they would plot for years to hijack a jury to punish a gun manufacturer.  In the context of the Runaway Jury story the manufacturer deserves consequences for their business practices, while in real life guns are often a focus of misplaced blame for social violence.

That is NOT to imply that Grisham is not a talented writer of courtroom dramas.  It is meant to say that this story is a little weak and the climax is not particularly compelling.
We are asked to believe that for enough money expert jury-riggers can be hired to guarantee the outcome of a particular trial.  Is there a lot of call for such people?
Gene Hackman plays this expert jury-tamperer, and he makes a character who is difficult for me to imagine in real life pretty believable.  Dustin Hoffman portrays the honest attorney for the other side, and although Mr. Hoffman is one of our greatest living actors, his believability as a Louisiana Lawyer isn't complete.
John Cusack takes another step towards eventually attaining the stature of Hoffman and Hackman in the role of the jury member who has his OWN agenda on this trial, and Rachel Weisz is his accomplice.

A senseless tragedy where there is no one left to punish, nothing for the grieving families to go after - except the gun manufacturer.  Convinced that the gun people were responsible, one of the widows sues the manufacturer and the case ends up in court over a year later.
Enter Ranklin Fitch (Gene Hackman), jury expert.  Ranklin is well known for fixing juries and getting his clients the verdict they are paying him very well for.  In fact, he has never lost a case.  For Ranklin, laws were made to be broken.  As soon as the jury summons are mailed out to citizens in the local area, all of them are studied, scrutinized and evaluated.  Some are definites, in that they support the right to bear arms, others are bleeding heart liberals who no one wants on the jury.  Still others are wild cards - like Nicholas Easter...
Nicholas Easter is your typical citizen who works, plays and sleeps, living his life in a normal fashion.  He is upset when the jury summons comes, of course, but is willing to do his civic duty, albeit begrudgingly.  At least that is the way he appears.  When Nicholas is seated on the jury, it soon becomes apparent that there is something not quite right about him.  And when the mysterious Marlee (Rachel Weisz) starts offering the jury to the highest bidder - Ranklin Fitch for the defense or Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) for the prosecution, Ranklin is stunned.  He has never been bested at his own game and he isn't about to start now.  Ranklin knows that Wendell is a straight arrow and will refuse to dabble in jury tampering, but Ranklin just wants to win - no matter what it takes...
Runaway Jury sounds like an exciting, well-made film, but it just isn't.  The cast is tremendously talented and they do their best to make their characters something about the norm, but they cannot elevate the holes in the plot.  It is fairly obvious what is going on from the beginning, an issue that is forgivable if there are still little surprises along the way, which there were, but there are just big gaps in the storyline.  First of all, I cannot get past the whole issue of the trial.  There is no way that anyone would be able to sue the gun manufacturers for an incident like this and win.  It would be difficult for the case to be won against big tobacco, as has been proved time and again, but impossible against guns.  They are two completely different stories.  Grisham wrote a book about the smoking issue, a book that I found so stultifying that I couldn't even finish it, but the movie would have been much stronger if they had stuck with this issue - who cares if it had been compared to The Insider!  Doesn't Hollywood always make movies in 2s and 3s anyway?  Regardless of the lack of plot, the movie is worth renting just to watch some wonderful acting going on.  John Cusack, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and Rachel Weisz all did a fabulous job in their roles, adding depth and dimension to a movie that so easily could have been bland and colorless.

1971207,3,B00014NF02,"Director:  Gary Fleder
Cast:  John Cusack, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz, Bruce Davison, Bruce McGill, Jeremy Piven.
Running Time:  126 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for some violence and language.
An entertaining courtroom drama with a twist unfortunately doomed by a script with several blunders, ""Runaway Jury"" is still a worthwhile experience that promotes a great ensemble cast and a fair adaptation of the popular John Grisham novel.  The film opens with a riveting murder scene, as a business is terrorized by an intruder with an automatic firearm, killing eleven people, injuring five more, and ends his own life.  Fast-forward a year later, in which the wife of one of the deceased victims plans to take the firearm distributor to trial because of the easy accessibility the criminal had to guns.
John Cusack plays the slick video-game expert Nicholas Easter, who happens to be one of the twelve jurors selected for the trial.  Easter, like all of the other jurors, were hand-picked by the illustrious advisor Rankin Fitch, who uses otherworldly technology and tons of manpower in order to ensure a favorable verdict for the defense.  Prosecutor Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) is a sincere and excellent attorney fighting for justice, but also embodies a tenacity that may cause him to win at Fitch's own game.  What Fitch did not prepare for was the sneaky Easter, who with the help from girlfriend Rachel Weisz, attempts to sabotage the jury and use both the ruthless Fitch and the bold Rohr to get some fast cash.
""Runaway Jury"" is complex and intriguing, combining many of the excellent qualities of the Grisham novel and bringing them together in a fairly intelligent drama.  The picture succeeds with its good performances, especially Hackman as the egotistical jury-tamperer with the win-at-all-costs attitude and Cusack as the likable, yet equally as intense Easter who has the manipulative power to single-handedly sway a jury.  However, despite the great star power, the film fails to be believable in many instances and does not deliver that exciting of a finale.

1971210,3,B00014NF02,"Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman provided great acting and were excellent cast selection.
The right to bear arms is a God given right.  The facts surrounding the story focused on a real world media spectacular, where a ""disgruntled day-trader"" blames the broker house for severe trading losses and massacres eleven people.  A law suite between the wife of a slain employee and the manufacturer of the automatic weapon used in the killing by the day trader becomes an issue of product liability.  The question to the jury is whether the manufacturer of the weapon is responsible and therefore liable for the usage of the weapon in the killing.  In the movie the jury concludes the manufacturer is responsible and liable and should pay 110 million dollars in punitive damages.
Grisham twists the right to own guns issue, for the big screen:  The flood-gate of deterrence is open; precedence established to sue for product liability in the usage of the weapon; the message: you build a weapon and it is used in a killing, the manufacturer must pay; and the constitutional right to own weapons, in question.  Grisham may be advocating an underlying message that people should not own weapons because they are dangerous and people get hurt from these weapons.  He does not seem to see the larger danger of forfeiting this constitutional right.
Grisham makes fun of the jury system, as he should.  The jury system was originally designed to bring in jurors who knew the defendant.  These were not witnesses, who knew the defendant but jurors.  Jurors that knew the defendant had insight into the day-to-day interactions with the defendant.  The judgment of the juror was expected to weight out all the circumstances surrounding the criminal event.  Grisham takes the high tech Hackman and use him too dissect upon the members of the juror and select them based on profile helpful too win him the case.
Grisham further makes fun of the idea of punitive damages.  The justice of fair reparations for damages is the focal point.  The jurors argue about what is fair saying they never ask for a hand out and why should the surviving wife receive a handout from the juror.  The argument goes to far and one member of the juror says its not about law and loses credibility with the other members.  Fair reparation collapses to massively punitive weight of 110 million dollars.
The buying of the Juror seemed a distraction.  It more interestedly show how easy jurors could be manipulated.  It had less too do with Justice.",1085356800,,2508,4.861176470588235

The Chamber, The Brethern, and Bleachers, not so much.  All that being said, Runaway Jury is probably my favorite Grisham book and when I saw that it was going to be made into a movie with John Cusack and Gene Hackman, I thought it would have to be a pretty awesome movie.  Well, I don't know about awesome, but it is a pretty good movie.
For those of you who've not read the book, I won't give away too much of the plot.  The basics are that there's a case involving a gun company being sued in a wrongful death suit.  Gene Hackman plays an unethical jury consultant for the defense team who goes about trying to pick a jury that will give him the win.  What he doesn't count on is the fact that one of the jury members is influencing the other members and is looking for a payoff to deliver a verdict for either side.  I won't go into much more detail because as you watch the movie, most of the twists and turns become very evident.
A few things about the cast.  John Cusack is great as usual and really seems to enjoy playing Nicholas Easter.  If you're expecting to see a lot of Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman though, then you need to go rent Hoosiers or The Graduate because you won't see a lot of them in this movie.  Not counting the courtroom scenes, both legendary actors only get about twenty, maybe thirty minutes of screentime and only have one scene together.
Sure the plot has been changed from the book, but after ""The Insider,"" I think the stuido probably didn't think the public would want another movie about cigarette companies on trial.  Plus, the trial's kind of secondary to the plot anyway so it doesn't really disrupt anything.

1971215,5,B00014NF02,"People who don't like this movie are in 2 camps: the true gun lovers or the true John Grisham lovers. They dislike the movie either because they dislike the gun-control message conveyed in the movie or because they dislike the screen adaptation of the original novel (they think the book is better and the adaption ruined it).
I didn't read the book before seeing this movie, and let me withhold my view on gun-control for now - just focus on the movie itself. Great cast, gripping plot, wonderful acting from every stars in the movie, inspiring dialogue, every elements of this movie worked, kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to the end, a very satisfying movie-going experience. Put politics and the original novel aside, this movie by itself is simply a masterpiece!
By the time I left the theatre I knew this movie will be trashed by a lot of reviewers (as right here in Amazon) because in this country there are just too many stubborn people believe gun ownership somehow represents some kind of freedom or self-defense right, therefore any anti-gun message equals to anti-freedom and anti-self-defense-right - hence it must be trashed. Laugh out loud.
The amusing fact is, by the time you could fetch your own gun locked at home somewhere (otherwise it's illegal) to defend yourself, you've probably already been shot down by the offender. What good does owning a gun do to the victims in the movie (they were shot dead in their office)? On the other hand, if the offender in the movie doesn't have access to a gun, say he's using a knife, then he just couldn't kill so many innocent people. Obviously in most situations, guns won't defend you, guns only facilitate the offender! So let's complete the favorite rubbish into a full meaningful sentence - ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"" - by guns!
The gun manufacturer also differs from tobacoo company and McDonald's in a key term - choice. You can choose by your own will to ruin your lung (...) but you can't choose to live when a criminal shot you with a gun. Although you can choose to own a gun or not, you can't choose if someone else who owns a gun to shot you or not. It's gun manufacturer who violets your freedom and right, not gun-control advocate.
So if you're anti-gun and pro-gun-control, then go to see this movie and you will love it. Otherwise, don't bother to see this movie, you could instead do the society a favor by shooting yourself with your beloved gun. LOL.",1083283200,3,2463,4.638443935926773

1971238,1,B00014NF02,"My goodness, who come this classic from John Grisham been so poorly and pathetically ruined!
Let me say first that I have read ALL of JG's books so far (please check my reviews from his books here in Amazon as well) and this was one of his masterpieces in my humble opinion; so imagine how anxious I was to finally watch it on screen!
But... so many differences appeared that it made me almost leave the theater 20 minutes after the movie started.
First: the plot has changed. The book dwelled on a plot against a tobacco company (which sounded credible) and the movie on a gun company (a long boring debate regarding the bill of rights legitimity to bear weapons almost made me fall asleep because of it's inconsistency).
Second: most of the subtle job the main character (N. Easter) performs with other jurors is practically unmentioned. In my opinion, this was perhaps the most ""glueing"" thing the book had to make you read it non-stop.
Third: The film is focused basically in Dustin Hoffman (plaintiff lawyer) where in the book his character is practically a secondary one. The defense attorney is the real key in the book, where in the movie we barely know what they do.
Of course there are things that are changed when you film a book, but this is totally different from the original source!",1082937600,6,1297,4.619047619047619
1971239,2,B00014NF02,"Slick and improbable adaptation of the John Grisham book not only burns the premise of the novel with an unnecessary bad story about gun responsibility but also lacks the real direction of a director who knows what he is doing. Scenes go by way too fast to comprehend what is going on from time to time and a lot of the movie itself does not even fit with the whole story. Characters come in and then disappear with out motive, and much of the back-story does not make sense in some parts of the film. Not to mention that the whole scam would have been exposed in a matter of minutes if the characters were to try what they did in the real world.
Like everyone who has written here, I agree that the acting is the only major draw in this film. The only problem with that is the fact that you have good actors who are going against a bad script that really does not know what to do with itself. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz are the best things here because they are least make their characters a bit interesting with performances that are better than the whole script of the film. Gene Hackman. has done this character like a billion times over but he does it with a real sense of class and menace. Rachel Weisz not only outdoes Hackman in their scenes together but also gives her character a real reason to do what she is doing. The rest of the cast is great as well with John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman giving great support, and a good cast that is really not used too much because the script really does not know what to do with them.
Stick with the book, and see the movie for Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman, because they give great performances in this bad movie. Which is a shame because they could have used their talents in a much better film than this.",1082937600,2,1757,4.2792792792792795
1971240,4,B00014NF02,"Where are Henry Fonda and the other eleven angry men when you need them?
A couple years after a disgruntled employee goes postal and guns down several workers in a high-rise office, the widow of one sues the weapons manufacturer for liability stemming from negligent selling practices. She's represented by Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman), and the defendant is represented by Durwood Cable (Bruce Davison), the latter being nothing more than a pawn of his cynical, scheming, and brilliant jury consultant, Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman). It's a Big Case; a win for the plaintiff would open the floodgates of lawsuits against all U.S. gun makers.
Fitch will stop at nothing - bribery, intimidation, theft, violence - to ensure that the empanelled twelve vote for acquittal. And he's backed up by a high-tech team with enough computer power and snooping devices to makes the CIA look like amateurs. The viewer is left believing he could peer into the judge's private toilet stall if he so desired.
But there's an unforeseen complication to Fitch's plan. Jury member Nicholas Easter (John Cusack) and his accomplice on the outside, Marlee (Rachel Weisz), set about demonstrating their ability to control the jury's actions and its environment. Easter and Marlee envision a bidding war between the two opposing sides; the winner gets the verdict.
The producer of RUNAWAY JURY have taken the politically correct approach and put the angels on the side of Rohr and his client. The CEO of the arms company is, of course, a contemptible viper perfectly willing to hire Rankin to stack the deck. NRA members in the audience will grind their teeth and rend their hunting jackets. However, if you can get past the blatant political agenda of the script, buried in the film is a clever and absorbing tale of revenge that's revealed in a satisfying plot twist.
It's hard to imagine Dustin Hoffman being upstaged, but here he takes a back seat to Hackman and Cusack. Dustin's best scene is perhaps in the courthouse gents' loo where Rohr debates the sanctity of justice born of the American jury system with a sarcastic and dismissive Fitch. Indeed, Hackman is the best reason to watch. (How many bad Hackman performances have there been? Earlier this year, he carried the show in the otherwise silly and meritless MOOSEPORT.) Cusack is effective as the imperturbable, charming, and cool manipulator of events. And Rachel Weisz is not only pretty to look at, but she has center stage in the film's best fight scene with one of Rankin's goons. Davison as Cable is eminently irrelevant.
If you're expecting a taut courtroom drama, don't look here. The action and conflict of RUNAWAY JURY take place behind the jury box and judge's bench and, though they're sometimes implausible, they're well-crafted, well-photographed, and well-edited.
I read John Grisham's book of the same title, but too long ago to make a meaningful comparison with the screen version. My gut feeling, though, is that it's an above-average adaptation.",1082764800,2,3002,5.042253521126761

New Orleans was not the setting of this book, and it shows on the way the place just sticks out like a shore thumb, even distracting you from what you are trying to watch.  The action scenes were not in the book, and the confrontation between the lawyers did not happened in the book. That was tacked on for the Hackman and Hoffman showdown that did disappoint in a major way because of the way the script handle the whole thing. Gene Hackman is such a fine actor, and it shows by the way that he just makes you watch him, even when you don't even want to watch the movie. Rachel Weisz is just as great as he is and she almost upstages him in their scenes together. Dustin Hoffman is enigma of sorts in this movie but he does give a fine performance, even though he is yelling most of the time he is in this film.

1971243,3,B00014NF02,"Based on the John Grisham novel of the same name, ""Runaway Jury"" is a moderately entertaining tale of jury tampering run amok.  The case - not one intended to please NRA members or firearms manufacturers - involves a lawsuit filed by an aggrieved widow to hold a gun company responsible for the death of her husband in a brokerage firm massacre.  Although there really isn't a single believable moment anywhere to be found in the film, a cast of first-rate professionals manages to pull it off anyway.  The roster includes such acting heavyweights as Dustin Hoffman, as a principled prosecutor; Gene Hackman, as an utterly unprincipled jury rigger; John Cusack, as a seemingly reluctant juror with a few surprises up his sleeve; and Rachel Weisz, as an ""amateur"" jury tamperer who is attempting to beat the big boys at their own corrupt game.
The modus operandi of a movie like ""Runaway Jury"" is to manipulate the audience into believing that what it is seeing is even remotely plausible - a John Grisham specialty in fact - and ""Runaway Jury"" does its job reasonably, though not spectacularly, well.  Still, as long as you are willing to suspend your disbelief and critical faculties for the duration of the flick, you may well fall under ""Runaway Jury""'s spell.  However, you'll have to swallow the rather dubious notion that it's okay to engage in jury tampering as long as you're doing it for the ""right"" reason.  Even if you find yourself balking at this prospect, the film is worth seeing for the first-ever pairing of Hoffman and Hackman in the same movie - and, indeed, we are treated to one sizzling encounter between the two actors in a courthouse men's room.

The acting is (like every one has been saying) the only redeeming thing in the movie because it least it shows actors who still care for the craft. Gene Hackman has done this role so many times before but it still as fresh as it was yesterday. Rachel Weisz is compelling as Hackman's thorn on his side, matching his acting chops mano to mano on the screen. She is the only actor in the entire movie that is as strong as he is in her performance. Dustin Hoffman is good as well and he does show that he is still a great actor but his character does not have as much prominence as Hackman and Weisz, and he role is diminish as the movie goes on.

I didn't care for the way they carried the story onto script. But what kept me from turning this review into a 1 or 0 star was the acting.
Hackman can do no wrong, it seems. I was the few who adored his acting in The Heist, so I have not seen him fall flat. Hoffman was, as always, excellent. Watching these two Hollywood stars act together was exciting. I was shocked that these two haven't acted together on camera, but it was worth the wait. The 'bathroom' scene was shot terrificly and they kept my interest for the entire movie. Hackman will always be the best Villian of all time.

Other for the major flaws in the story, I liked the performances of its actors who made this viewing experience a joy despite the stupidity of the story.  Rachel Weisz is great as a mysterious woman out to sell the jury to the highest bitter, and Gene Hackman is good as a lawyer who will stop at nothing to secure the verdict for his client.

1971250,4,B00014NF02,"""Runaway Jury,"" based on John Grisham's thriller, is terrific light entertainment that had me riveted to the screen. How can one go wrong with Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman and John Cuzack as lead actors? The four screenwriters, Brain Koppelman, David Levien, Rick Cleveland and Matthew Chapman skillfully created an intriguing, suspenseful drama from the book. Film director Gary Fleder manages the tension which focuses on juror number 13. And the suspense keeps building to a bang-up climax with an unusual twist. Now this is not a great film that will be viewed as a classic in 10 years. The movie has its hackneyed moments and when they came - I didn't mind at all. This is a 'fun' thriller where one wants to root for the good guys and hiss at the villains.

A disgruntled employee, recently fired from his New Orleans brokerage firm, returned to the office with a semi-automatic weapon and brutally murdered more than a score of his fellow employees. One of the dead victims' wives sues the gun manufacturer and hires progressive attorney Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman), to represent her. The gun lobby, fearful of a precedent-setting verdict hires the ruthless, brilliant Jury Consultant Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman) to investigate the potential jury pool and handpick the jury. Fitch, a masterful manipulator, wires-up the defense attorney, hides a camera in a briefcase set on the defense table and directs the defense case from a war room where a cast of hit men, investigators and computer technicians assist him. Counselor Rohr has one Jury Consultant, hired at the last moment, and he doesn't seem to have computer access. But Rohr, who believes in his client, his case and the integrity of the jury system is not the slightest bit intimidated by his opponents.

Nick Easter, (John Cusack), wangles his way past Fitch's radar and gets on the jury. And this is where the action really begins. Easter, assisted by his lovely cohort Marlee, (Rachel Weisz), play both the defense and the prosecution, offering, (and threatening) to manipulate the jury for the highest bidder. Exciting stuff...but I won't spoil the plot!

Gene Hackman is such a marvelous villain. He barks orders and orchestrates operations as a general would wage a war. And he's a mean man to cross. Hoffman is a much older ""Graduate"" figure - still idealistic and fighting the 'establishment.' And Cusack plays his role to perfection. One just doesn't know where, how or when he will make his move. I think this is Grisham's best screen adaptation yet. Not deep - just fun!

1971251,2,B00014NF02,"A motion picture following in the not-so-illustrious filmmaking footsteps of such feature-length propaganda films as ""John Q"" and ""The Life of David Gale"", ""Runaway Jury"" was doomed to well-deserved obscurity by its awful script before the first scene was shot.
  I went into this movie with rather high expectations.  Though I have no love for John Grisham, I am very fond of John Cusack's work.  Unfortunately, not even his solid perfomance could save this movie.
  ""Runaway Jury"" suffers from a complete lack of originality (even after the producers changed the legal target of this film from big tobacco to gun control; presumably to avoid having to be compared with ""The Insider"").  Most average moviegoers will see the predictable plot ""twists"" a mile away.
  The plot and most of the characters (especially Gene Hackman's) become so farfetched that this movie might as well take place on the Starship Enterprise.  Still, even with the fantastic, the movie manages to drag on... and on... and on during its considerable middle stages. I started to wonder if it would ever end.
  Mercifully it did, and came to a ""climax"" so predictable and so (there's no other way to say this): Hollywood, that I was left with the intense feeling that I would have been better intellectually served by watching Pokemon.
  The agenda of the producers is so painfully clear throughout the movie that the characters might as well have been wearing sandwich boards spouting anti-gun slogans.  Even supporters of gun-control will be turned off by the constant self-serving nature of this picture, and offended by the lack of subtlety in which the writers have chosen to deliver the message.  They really do think we're stupid.
  Oh, and John Cusack, homey, this is strike two after ""Identity"".  Maybe you can get back with Steven Frears and JB and do a sequel to ""High Fidelity"" for redemption.

1971253,2,B00014NF02,"Tepid half-baked legal mish-mash that's all dressed up with nowhere useful to go. John Grisham's source novel about jury manipulation in a tobacco industry litigation has been adapted to move the action to the issue of gun control (though the film makers needn't have bothered - there was never any danger of this ever being confused with Michael Mann's superior The Insider). Confronted with the gun death of her husband in an incident of work rage, a widow is persuaded to institute civil action against the gun industry - which has never lost a lawsuit of this type. That established, she then promptly disappears for the rest of the film as the viewer is asked to believe in the determinism of jury consutants (thank OJ for that!) and the worthiness of corrupt jurors. It's all totally forgettable nonsense - a courtroom movie for the hysterical tabloid set that distinguishes itself for having the most underwritten, unmoving courtroom summation ever put to screen (although everyone involved clearly thought this was a rousing moment). Many of the American reviewers on this page have taken issue with the film's soapbox politics on the issue of gun violence. Providing it with so much credit only distracts from a far more basic reflection - how incredibly bad this movie is. Director Gary Fleder (Don't Say a Word) is fast becoming synonymous with over-produced below average thrillers, an association he proudly continues with this latest sub-par outing. Unlike the best Grisham adaptations (The Firm; The Rainmaker) Fleder eschews character-driven tension and conflict for show-offy gadgetry and overly-dramatic presentation of fairly undramatic things. Grisham, as usual, has share of the blame for the incredulous proceedings - having frankly benefited over the years by the quality overcompensation that film-makers have brought to his work. Fleder however is no Sydney Pollack - and he's certainly no Francis Coppola (and, on this latest evidence, never will be). What we lose in quality mediation, we gain in stupidity - as the lawyers pale into caricatures of idiocy and irrelevance, the jury room rehashes and exploits your memory of infinitely better movies; the American legal system looks even more of a joke than it actually is and the lead characters behave in ways so dumb that you wonder how they could get their heads around the schemes you're asked to believe they're engaged in. John Cusack and Rachel Weiz give workmanlike performances, whilst Gene Hackman tries his characteristic best to deliver a nastier version of the Gene persona we know and love  - only just about overcoming his own infectious charisma enough for us to dislike his character. The real acting news however is yet another nail in the coffin of the Dustin Hoffman legend. If ever there was any doubt about the steady decline (dating back to his overrated performance in Rain Man) of this once truly great master, Runaway Jury will dispose of it. Hoffman's performance is as hammy as it is portentous, with a Southern accent by way of Brooklyn amateur dramatics. Al Pacino has become louder and show-offy as he's aged - but still delivers the goods. Hoffman seems only to have become more self-involved, self conciously ticcing and twitching his way to delivering ""a performance"" worthy of the acting legend he uncontrovertably is - and (perhaps problematically) knows he is. (To be frank, the evidence of this tendency can be found early on in his peformance in his own directorial debut, Straight Time). Come back Benjamin, all is forgiven. Runaway Jury stutters and splutters along in underwelming execution from one clumsy plot point to the next, reaching its preposterous ""twist"" ending by way of sheer assault on your IQ. In the end, the only twelve angry men in this tortuous deal are in the audience - demanding a refund on their ticket money.",1081209600,4,3850,5.053459119496855

(In the case of this film, a victim's family is going after the big gun manufactures, as the perpetrator committed suicide. Winning this case would set a legal precedent that the gun people cannot tolerate or afford.)  When Grisham is asked if he writes a novel particularly for film, he denies it, however, the moviemakers in tinsel town can't seem to resist adapting his stories for the big screen. Some film adaptations are good, others not so good, but they have generally found their niche in the mainstream marketplace.
All in all, though, this film runs at a good pace, is well acted, and keeps one's attention until its surprising end. This is not a great film, but it's certainly not a bad film either.
Some critics have commented that Runaway Jury's content is merely a propaganda device to push an argument against the gun lobby. Perhaps, as the gun establishment are depicted as ruthless down-home gangster types, who will do anything to ensure that all-important legal precedent is not made against them. Guns are a contentious issue and this film addresses it squarely though clearly leans towards the anti-gun side of the argument.

This brings this film more in line with what is happening with the issues we see in the media.  What the movie does lack in plot it makes up for in star power.  You have two great veteran actors, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman, squaring off for a major battle.

1971258,3,B00014NF02,"See the news today, April 2, 2004? Yup, those 2 Tyco big-shots bought themselves a mistrial and walked, at least for now. Walked out just a-smilin' and a-wavin', the skunks. Yet here's Martha Stewart facing a jail term over WHAT now? Trying to snatch some phantom thousands from thin air by trading her ImClone shares early? Kozlowski and Swartz stole $600 MILLION, yet THEY are the ones who go free-for-now on some trumped-up ""questionable juror"" issue while small-fry Martha will soon be facing sentencing.
As Mammy in ""Gone With the Wind"" might say: ""It ain't fittin', Mr. Rhett. Is jez ain't fittin'.""
Feel like treating yourself this weekend? Rent ""Runaway Jury"" with Gene Hackman (the consummate professional, and he gets more handsome every year!), Dustin Hoffman (often too self-satisfied for my taste, but here he's quite watchable as the do-gooder attorney), John Cusack (a vastly underrated actor who works so quietly you hardly know he's there, but he's always totally classy), and Rachel Weisz (fast becoming a favorite of mine, gorgeous AND talented, a rare combination!) with a treasure trove of notable character actors (Bruce Davison, Jeremy Piven, Cliff Curtis, Jennifer Beals, Rusty Schwimmer, Luis Guzman, Dylan McDermott) in minor roles or cameos. If you can ignore the preposterous plot, it's total eye candy for the actors alone ...
Waiiiit a minute. Did I say ""preposterous plot""? Well, yeah, sure, it's ""preposterous."" The high-priced jury consultant (Hackman) advising the attorney for ""the bad guys"" has unlimited bucks at his disposal, a staff as big as the FBI to help him out with his dirty tricks, and a warehouse full of electronic gizmos to spy on the jurors in order choose the best ones for their side and then to blackmail them; that's ""preposterous,"" isn't it? Yeah, and the prosecuting attorney is just a Nice Guy with a heart of gold, only wants what's best for his client, and can't be bought; now, THAT is DEFINITELY preposterous! Through a series of labyrinthine plot twists, the entire jury is tampered with by one juror with a secret agenda who has the power and the
brilliance to throw the verdict one way or the other at any moment ... pretty damned ""preposterous"" unless you look at the Tyco and Martha Stewart trials, and then you've GOTTA wonder.
""Runaway Jury"" is not a ""great"" movie by any stretch. It also has an unabashedly political bias (Left). That said, FORGET about all that; this movie is terrific SPECULATION from beginning to end, a ""what-if"" scenario featuring a tragicomedy of errors, oversights, sloppiness, precalculated malevolence, and questionable legal shenanigans that -- IF they were ever to happen precisely that way -- would produce the film's conclusion. ""Runaway Jury"" is almost like a ""sci-fi"" legal thriller that projects you into a ""future"" world where justice doesn't exist except as a game ...
Unless we're already in that ""future,"" which situations like this Tyco mistrial make me suspect.
Despite all its ""implausibility,"" I found this film immensely watchable (for the powerhouse actors) and thought-provoking (for the ideas) and didn't feel like picking it apart for every little way in which I could pronounce it preposterous. The contention, or supposition, of ""Runaway Jury"" is that one well-organized juror with a personal vendetta and the righteous zeal of a Carrie Nation reformer can run around throwing trials and getting away with it. The way it's done in this film is a little over-the-top, but it's not TOTALLY implausible, and that's the scary part.
The film ends on a sloppy-sentimental-smarmy note as if we're supposed to think that ""justice has been served anyway,"" but it hasn't been because it's been horrendously tampered with both by the so-called ""good guys"" and by the so-called ""bad guys,"" with the jurors themselves treated like expendable pawns. Scariest line from the film is uttered by Gene Hackman: ""Trials are too important to be left up to juries."" He's supposed to be the ""bad guy"" for saying as much, but he's no worse than the so-called ""good guys"" who try to thwart him behind the scenes in the jury room.
If you take this film ""literally,"" you'll probably think it's lame, especially the feel-good ending. If, on the other hand, you think about those 2 goons who just walked away with $600 million of Tyco's money and a mistrial and imagine THEM hiring a sophisticated slime-bucket like Gene Hackman in ""Runaway Jury"" to help them target the jury ... or if you think about the ""questionable juror"" who's supposed to have screwed up the Tyco trial and imagine that juror to be a Wild Card with a personal crusade like John Cusack's in ""Runaway Jury"" ... well, you just might find this movie interesting after all. Prophetic, even. Just check out the news today.",1080950400,,4778,4.988721804511278

It isn't a ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" kind of movie, but it is exciting enough to keep you interested.  By switching the legal assult against the Tobacco industry, as it is in the book, they have changed the focus to the gun manufacturers.  With the boiling issues on gun control, this movie couldn't come at a better time. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in star power.  You have Gene Hackman playing the notorious guy everyone wants to hate, and the mild mannered, idealistic counter-part played by Dustin Hoffman.  These two charaters are a great contrast to each other and add enough to the movie to make you want to see it.

Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz do give great performances in this movie, which we all agree the film did not deserve because of its badly written script and disjointed direction which steer away greatly from the book. Even though they may have already done the tobacco thing in the movie ""The Insider"", I feel the story in the original book by John Grisham was a much better depiction of the subject. Hollywood would rather sugar cover the issue but the real world is not that simple, and the movie would have been great if they stuck to the book's original story.  They had great actors involved like Weisz, Hackman, Hoffman, and Cusack, so a great screenplay based on the original novel would not have been a tall order to give.
My two stars goes to the efforts of Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, and the rest of the cast who mad a bad script look good by their performances.  The movie as a whole does not warrant anything above a one star review.",1080777600,7,1050,4.463541666666667

I suppose they must have discovered they make more money selling movies about things recognizably human, and so Hollywood Socialist Realism, a cinematic offshot of Soviet Socialist Realism, has sort of taken its well-earned rest on the ash heap of history with the Soviet Union itself.
This one, though, is a throwback to Hollywood's Golden Era, where every happy American would--nearly unanimously--do the Good Left-Wing Thing, if each American weren't personally terrorized by an Evil White Man, the merciless, tireless, well-paid, sadistic minion of Many Rich Evil White Men, all of whom will stop at nothing to continue being Evil.  In this movie, it is revealed that the Constitution is Evil.  No surprise there--what else could it be, written, as it was, by Evil Rich White Men.
In this wondrous sphere women beat up men, even--maybe especially--Evil White Men who are what might be described as Lesser Sadistic Minions of the main Sadistic Minion.  (I estimate that in movie fistfights between the sexes in the last 20 years, women are 378-4, with several draws.  Do they truly believe this?  Wife-beating is alive and well in Hollywood.  I know the leading men tend to be 5'3"", but jeeze...)

I'm not saying I think that the modern member of the bar is a saint, however, I think Hollywood got a little too carried away here.
The movie itself was entertaining, if not a bit predictable and somewhat of a clich in ways.  I suppose I don't understand why a good book isn't just made into a good film, but then again, who am I?

1971266,1,B00014NF02,"This movie was a stinker of epic proportions.  The plot was completely transparent.  I accurately predicted the movie's ending merely 20 minutes into it.  It was nothing but a typical Hollywood anti-gun propoganda piece.  The acting and the movie itself were completely over-the-top and never gave me the sense of ""this could really be happening""(remember this is not Terminator, it's supposed to be plausible).  Everything fell into place too perfectly for the anti-gun people.  The people were also way too stereotypical, ie: every anti-gun person was of perfect moral character and brilliant, meanwhile, the gun supporters were all selfish and concerned only with money and they also happened to be so stupid that they were easily outwitted at every turn.  The fact that the movie was completely implausible is a great disservice to John Grisham, who usually spins a tale that is very believable.
Maybe the most disappointing aspect of the movie was the acting.  There were probably 10 actors/actresses that I recognized and I even knew most of their names, however, not one performance was even decent.  Gene Hackman mailed his performance in as he looked detached the whole movie.  Dustin Hoffman played the sympathetic hero so uninspired that I was rooting for him to lose the whole time.  Rachel Weisz tried hard, but her character was written terribly.  There's no way she could control everything that well, and her fight scene was less believable than anything I've ever seen in a Steven Seagal film.  John Cusak wasn't half bad, but he certainly didn't do anything that stood out as good acting.  As far as the rest of the cast; they did nothing, there's not a single memorable line or scene in the whole movie (what was Jeremy Piven doing, he wasn't funny, and in the end he did NOTHING to advance the outcome of the plot).
I don't even know where else I should go, basically, this movie was absolutely terrible.  To make my point further, I watched The Rundown with the Rock immediately after this movie, and thought it should have won an academy award compared to this piece of garbage!",1080518400,4,2100,4.892655367231638

As for the hypocritical Democratic anti-gun propaganda; it STUNK and it stinks BAD.  In spite of that the movie was fantastic as far as plot weaving and story telling goes.
Juror #9 (don't know actor's name) played his part well and had a really cool part to play.  His female accomplice (don't know who she is) grew on me and the fight scene in the apartment (and the outcome of it) was a nice ride on the journey to her beautiful and engaging smile at the end of the movie.
Gene Hackman made a great villan, as always.
A mature Dustin Hoffman played a ""clean"" role (unlike so many of his immoral and irreverent roles in his younger days) and he came across wonderfully doing it.  Loved his character.
Could have done without the saint whatever-her-name-was idolatry being cool with the lead characters toward the beginning of the movie, but I guess that's Hollywood (giving off its normal stench).

The only problem with that is the fact that you have two good actors and two very miscast actors who ham it up like there is no tomorrow.  Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz are the major draw here because they are least make their characters a bit interesting with performances that are better than the whole script of the film.  Gene Hackman. has done this character like a billion times over but he does it with a real sense of class and menace. Rachel Weisz not only outdoes Hackman in their scenes together but gives her character a passionate reason to do what she is doing in the trail. Dustin Hoffman and John Cusack are terribly miscast in their roles, with Hoffman over acting all over the place with the force of a gym teacher losing a basketball game and John Cusack looking like he does not even know what he is doing with himself from time to time.

1971270,5,B00014NF02,"With this outstanding movie, moviegoers are treated to another extremely well written story from the master of legal thrillers, John Grisham.  From the beginning to the end of this film it is a taut, intense thriller of a tale that has the viewer guessing the end result the whole way through and as any good thriller of this nature is, most will not see the outcome coming until the director wants you to.
One of the most amazing aspects of this film is that after so many years in the business, it's the first time Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman have squared off in a film and it is done perfectly, both deserving of high praise for their performances in this film.  I've never been a big fan of John Cusack and his performance in this film doesn't really change that too greatly but he does do a great job with this script.  Rachel Weisz, as ever beautiful and talented gives a great performance in this film to include her American accent.
Director Gary Fleder, probably best known for ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Don't Say A Word"" does an outstanding job with this film although one can't help but think that with such an exceptional script it would almost be too difficult to not make such a wonderful legal thriller.
The Premise:
""The Runaway Jury"" is the story of a major trial where a widow is suing a weapons manufacturing company that just happened to be the one that made the weapon that was used by a killer who went on a shooting spree in her husband's office, killing her husband and several other before turning the weapon on himself.  As these trials happen occasionally and the jury's have never sided with the plaintiffs, this is a huge trial and the money involved is astronomical.  In comes Gene Hackman's character that is a jury consultant for the defense and has never lost  a case and he's up against a local lawyer for the plaintiff played by Dustin Hoffman.  The true catalyst for the suspense of this film kicks in when Rachel Weisz's character steps into the picture, informing the key players that she can guarantee a verdict and proves that she has some pull with the jury...
What follows from there is one of the most intense legal thrillers available on DVD today that is a pure joy to watch.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy these types of films.  {ssintrepid}

1971271,4,B00014NF02,"New Orleans is set to be the site of a monumental courtroom battle between gun manufacturers and anti-gun activists. A woman whose husband was killed when a disgruntled client went on a shooting rampage at his brokerage firm has enlisted the help of prominent New Orleans attorney Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) in suing the gun manufacturer whose ""Saturday night special"" killed her husband for damages. The Vicksburg Firearms Company has gotten themselves the best attorney that money can buy, and they have hired a crack jury consultant by the name of Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman) to ensure their victory before the trial has begun. But both Fitch and Rohr discover, much to their consternation, that the jury may not be theirs to influence. Juror Nick Easter (John Cusack) and his girlfriend Marlee (Rachel Weisz) have the jury in their pocket and intend to sell it to the highest bidder.

""Runaway Jury""  is based on John Grisham's best-selling novel of the same name. I haven't read the novel, but I understand that Wendell Rohr's character has been altered substantially for the film in order to more clearly differentiate between the two rival parties, and a gun manufacturer has been substituted for a tobacco company. The explosive confrontation between Rohr and Fitch -the only scene that these two great actors share- did not occur in the book. ""Runaway Jury"" is an effective, although almost entirely implausible, thriller that  sucks the audience in by giving us a taste of what goes on behind the scenes in high profile court cases. Specifically, we get to see the bizarre sub-culture of jury consultation and manipulation. The length and expense to which parties will go to stack a jury is endlessly fascinating and overcomes the story's more fantastic elements. The ""war room"" where Fitch and his team plot and plan is particularly interesting. The film's cast is spot-on. John Cusack is one of those actors that inspire sympathy in any role, which is helpful here since we know nothing about Nick except that he is trying to sell a jury. Dustin Hoffman is convincingly idealistic and naive as Rohr. And Gene Hackman is deliciously ruthless as Fitch. ""Runaway Jury"" has enough twists, turns, and thrills to keep us interested for the duration of its 2-hour-plus  running time. It's a fun, unpredictable thriller with the added bonus of some insight into the art and science of jury selection.

The DVD: This is a terrific disc that will more than satisfy fans and film buffs alike. These are the bonus features: 2 deleted scenes with director's commentary. 2 scenes from the film with actor commentary: Gene Hackman comments of the film's last scene, and Dustin Hoffman comments on the Washroom scene in which he appears with Hackman. ""Exploring the Scene"" featurette about the genesis and filming of the Washroom scene, the only scene in the film which Hoffman and Hackman share, including interviews with the two actors and director Gary Fleder. ""Off the Cuff"", an interview in which Hoffman and Hackman talk about their long friendship since 1956 when they were both students at The Pasadena Playhouse, sharing an apartment in New York, and some more recent anecdotes. ""The Ensemble"", a short featurette about the cast, including interviews with Rachel Weisz and John Cusack. A ""making-of"" documentary, which isn't very informative but includes, among other things, a short interview with Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, who was the jury consultant for the defense in O.J. Simpson's trial. ""Shadow and Light"", an interview with the film's cinematographer, Robert Elswit. ""A Vision of New Orleans"", in which production designer Nelson Coates shows us around the courtroom set that was created for the film. ""Rhythm"", an interview with the film's editor, William Steinkamp, in which we see an example of his important contribution to the film. The disc also has a full-length audio commentary by director Gary Fleder, which I didn't listen to, because I was worn out from the other extras.

It does not give the gun industry the benefit of the doubt and makes them look like evil men out to destroy the world, and makes the victims of gun violence into irrational people looking for money. It should have been a fair fight for both sides but with a script that does not do justice to ether side, the movie simply does not work.  The acting is great with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman being the standouts and John Cusack gives a good performance as well.

1971275,3,B00014NF02,"This movie is quite watchable and entertaining, and features a bravo performance by Gene Hackman as the amoral jury consultant/manipulator.  Unfortunately, the film's anti-gun message is brought forth in an in-your-face manner that even those with anti-gun views may find irritating, let alone those who believe in the Second Amendment.
The story is simple and predictable--a widow brings a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer who made the gun that killed her husband, on grounds that the manufacturer was negligent in allowing the gun to be distributed to a wrongdoer.  This is a switch from the John Grisham novel in which the litigation concerned tobacco companies--I guess Hollywood has it in for guns more than cigarettes. And of course the plot is not exactly unpredictable, but I won't give it away here.  The main thrust of the story is that Gene Hackman is a highly-paid jury consultant employed by the nefarious gun industry to ensure that a jury is selected and manipulated to return a defense verdict in the lawsuit.
Hackman's performance carries the film.  He plays the role of the tough-guy, unscrupulous jury consultant to perfection--the role is perfect for him and he takes full advantage of it.  Dustin Hoffman turns in a fine performance as the plaintiff's attorney, and he sure does get the Southern accent down solid.  But his character is relatively minor in the film. Hackman dominates.
This is an entertaining movie that would have been better if it had stayed closer to the original Grisham novel.  As it stands, the anti-gun message detracts from the otherwise entertaining plot and premise, and is a distraction regardless of what side of the gun control issue you happen to be on.  The ending is a bit too much of a formulaic cliche' to suit me.

This movie really had me going.  John Cusack's character was really nepharious and the movie had you always wondering what he was thinking, so......you didn't.  That is what made the movie itself an excellent piece of filmography. I was always wondering what was behind the suspense.  Who were these guys working fo?  I had not read the book and had no spoiler issues except brief reviews and trailers.
Hackman plays a hard fisted lawyer with a history and does a good job, Hoffman performs adequately as the plaintiff's attorney, yet not as deep and rich a job as he has done in other venues.  Cusack is great and Rachel Weisz stays in character for the whole movie.  You recognize other characters and that makes you feel comfortable right from the start.
So, if you want to get a good movie to watch, good casting and good and overall plot that is what you get and the reason for the 4 rating.  It would have been a five if it was not a gun/antigun movie.  You only see the gun, never the killer, so the issue here is guns.  But get the movie anyway.
However, the movie is on the same level as other Grisham movies as far as overall plot and that makes the movie worth a watch and even worth owning.",1079481600,5,1396,4.43921568627451

It rather make those things into movie cliches concerning good guys and bad guys, and have none of the real life problems that steams from the issues its trying to raised. This is more a Hollywood fantasy than a real movie, and that where the problem lies. It should have been more grounded in reality than it was and it just does a huge disservice to the problem other than try to address it.  I agree with the majority that the acting is the only plus here with Rachel Weisz, and Gene Hackman giving real performances in an other wise product of Hollywood fantasy. I though of them as real characters with real problems, and real conflicts. I credit that achievement to Weisz and Hackman as actors because they make you feel for them as people, while the script makes you feel nothing at all. They are the reason that this movie is better than it really should have been, and that if you think about it is pretty impressive considering that the movie as a whole fails miserably in what is trying to do.",1079308800,11,1248,4.449781659388647

Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and John Cusack shine by giving a real sense of conviction to their characters and that passion the reason I sat throe this film.  The film in question is not as good as the actors involved because it really does not know what it wants to be. It trying to be poignant in its views about violence but the views express are not really clear, and in trying to put forth its massage, the movie resorts to play on the tragedy of School violence to make its point. This would be a noble effort if it was done in the right way with some intelligence behind it but it looks gratuitous here because it rather play on the outrage of the violence perpetrated other than to stick to reason and logic to defend its case.
The actors involve in this movie deserve better than this because their performances are reason enough to make you see this movie, yet their time and energy is wasted in a movie that does not do them or the issues its trying to raise any justice.",1079222400,14,1192,4.321428571428571
1971283,5,B00014NF02,"I've seen most of the movies adapted from John Grisham novels, but I had not heard of Runaway Jury prior to this film. And man, am I glad, because if you don't know the book, then you will - like I did - really enjoy this DVD. The suspense builds up, and details and clues are revealed slowly.
.
Having read other reviewers' comments, I see that in the book the court case is directed at the tobacco industry rather than a gun manufacturer, but I feel that Michael Mann's film ""The Insider"" already tackled the (tobacco) subject rather well, and besides, you just can't deny that guns - and how easy it is to get them - in the States is an issue. It's all fair game anyway, after all, it's just movie entertainment.
The cast is very impressive. Hoffman, Hackman, Cusack, Weisz, are the major players - all excellent, but there are other well-known actors that play smaller roles (too many to mention), but I was especially won over by Cliff Curtis. I am a big fan of A-list actors playing small roles in films, lending their magic touch to scenes or characters. Curtis played a mesmerising Iraqi innocent in Three Kings, a menacing Latin American gangster in Training Day, and also recently appeared in last year's Whale Rider, filmed in his homeland of New Zealand. In Runaway Jury his part is rather small, but he just nails his character with so little screen time, which is the other reason to watch the movie: with so many talented actors, you just ache to see them all given their chance to shine. The scene written specifically for the movie to take advantage of having Hoffman and Hackman together on the big screen for the first time is very cool as well.
I know I didn't help you with the plot much, but in part it is because I hope you have the chance to watch the film with the same open mind as I did (having little prior knowledge about the film or its story). It's a good mix of a courtroom thriller, drama, and Hollywood fluff with a conscience, plus that unbeatable cast. If you know the book, I hope this film still makes you smile despite the inconsistencies; seeing all the fine actors involved should at least amuse you.
As for the DVD extras:
Full marks!! 20 minutes of scene rehearsal footage, and several interviews with Hoffman and Hackman talking about the movie, their characters, and how they met when they were young. None of that pretentious ""oh he's so talented"" nonsense that all these other actors always ooze about each other, just refreshingly honest and self-effacing chats with two movie legends. There are also two deleted scenes, some nice featurettes, and the obligatory commentary by Fleder, which is relatively interesting - but he's not the most charismatic director I've heard. Could be worse though, could be 8 people talking at the same time!
As you can tell, I really like this movie.  My four stars are very representative of the overall quality of this DVD release, so my marks reflect the film AND the excellent DVD extra features (particularly those with Hoffman and Hackman are a treat). This is one to own.

Why not sue hammer manufacturers, afterall, people are killed with hammers all the time..how about bathtub manufacturers for making them so deep you could drown?

In my opinion yes but we do not need a movie that skirts the issues raised by going on a self effacing crusade of judge and jury with out hearing all the facts from both sides of the case.  Besides all of that, the actors in this movie do their jobs by giving very good performances despite the hack job of the script they had to work with. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz are the standouts in this film and they give the best performances in an all star cast that includes the great Dustin Hoffman, and the charming John Cusack.

Since they didn't for whatever reason, it hurts the storyline. The actors are great, the story is tense, the ending has an incredible plot-twist that even the book didn't have...but you just can't get past the fact that it doesn't make any sense for this case to go to court in the first place.

John Cusack & Rachel Weisz are also very good & make an attractive couple you can root for. If you can suspend your incredulity on some points you have a very entertaining movie with good acting all around. Isn't that the whole point?
  The beauty of the dvd is the after movie commentary by Hoffman & Hackman alone & together talking about the classic scene with just the two of them earlier noted, plus scenes that were cut from the movie.  These scenes revealed motives of characters that weren't so obvious in the final cut. For some reason the director (?) wanted the movie to come in at less than two hours. They almost made it at 2:02.

1971292,4,B00014NF02,"Set in New Orleans, this John Grisham yarn, which required four screenwriters to make the transition to film, stretches credulity despite its wealth of legal detail. A young man, played by John Cusak, is called to jury duty and, with the aid of a witty and capable, seemingly new girlfriend he meets in a voodoo shop, proceeds to mastermind the jury, brought to court to adjudicate a case brought against gun companies in an office slaying that has left a devoted young husband and father dead. Gene Hackman plays the ruthless defense attorney and Dustin Hoffman the slightly less ruthless prosecution.  Both contemplate paying off the Cusak girlfriend, who pulls the strings behind the scenes, to ensure victory.  It is especially important to the gun company, as they advertise ""fingerprint proof"" exterior on their assault weapons that thus seem clearly marketed to criminals.  The issues involved, constitutional right to bear arms versus evil economic feedback between corporate and criminal culture, are obviously important, and Grisham is not only the master but the originator of his sub-genre of morally loaded legal thriller.  As with Greek heroes of ancient tragedy, whose strengths are their weakness, so Grisham's Runaway Journey seems to exemplify the double-edgedness of Grisham's formula. Although superficially, they seem, because of the breadth of legal knowledge and clever plotting, to be extremely realistic, in the end they are-or at least this one is-as I see it, fantasies of legal revenge.  Even barring the incredible casting of an intrepid, strikingly good-looking young couple able to mastermind the decision making of an entire jury by an all-but-total knowledge of legal precedent and human psychology-let alone their ability to convince top-notch lawyers of their near-preternatural abilities-it is difficult to believe that the expensive defense legal firm could involve so many people in an underground high-tech stakeout that spies, hires criminals to break-and-enter, commit arson, intimidate witnesses, and accept bribes.  Not to say that all these things don't happen, but the sheer density of the crimes committed by the defenders of the gun company, combined with the numbers of young accomplices, seems unlikely.  On the other hand, a recent news story revealed the CEO of Wesson to have been involved in multiple armed robberies and a prison escape. Found out, he stepped down as chairman but stayed on the board.  I  can imagine Grisham being a relatively idealistic young lawyer who became completely disgusted with the money basis, and amorality, of the legal system. So I see the formula he has discovered less as legal thriller than legal vengeance fantasy, in which those wronged-those who so often do not receive justice in the ""justice system""-finally get their comeuppance.  Dramatically, he exaggerates for the sake of clarity and imagines criminals-primarily those in the legal system, corporate culture, and government-getting what they deserve.

1971294,2,B00014NF02,"Predicable and unfaithful adaptation of John Grisham bestseller takes out the core of the novel, which was about tobacco and replaces it with a silly outlook about the state of gun violence. The views express in this film is one sided, and bias because it only focus on the outcome, not the problem. I know that the real plot of the film is about jury tampering but that fit better in the original book than this movie because it showed how far the tobacco industry was willing to corrupt the system in order to save their product, a problem that is all too real in our society. The jury tampering done in this movie only makes the gun manufactures look like they are trying to hid their responsibility from the public, which if you really think about it makes no sense what so ever because they really have nothing to hid at all. That plot point only fit the structure of the book which deals with how the tobacco industry was trying to hide the damaging effects of smoking, and how they continue to denied there effects on the human body.  If you think about it, everyone knows that guns kill, so why would a gun manufacture go through the trouble that it does in this movie to protect that fact from the public. In reality, the whole lawsuit would have been thrown out of court but we are talking about a Hollywood reality, not the real world.
Judging the movie as a whole, the direction was decent but a bit over flashy for a movie of this nature. I did not get the slow motion effects during conversation scenes in this movie. Maybe the director did it to show the emotional effects it had on the characters, but a real scene of emotion would have done the trick, and they are few and far between in this film. The acting is great, and that should be commented because it showed that the actors were professional enough to care about what they were doing. Gene Hackman is like fine wine, he gets better when he ages, and he does give a great performance that has many layers to it, even though the script does not show it. Rachel Weisz is great as well, and gives her character a strong, and determine edged that makes you believe in her cause, and she even adds a level of emotional clarity that makes identify with her as well. John Cusack is good as her accomplice in the scam, and he gives his charming con man a sense of caring and determination to win the jury over. Dustin Hoffman is also good as Hackman's rival in the courtroom, and gives his character an emotional depth that any lesser actor could not have done. His performance is a great reminder of what a classy actor of his caliber can do with a small part that should have been bigger.
The actors really work miracles with a script that has a depth of a shot glass, and for them (Hackman, Weisz, Hoffman, and Cusack) I do give Runaway Jury it credit but imagine how better this movie would have been if they had a script that reflected the original story, and a better direction.",1078617600,5,2951,4.385036496350365

If you don't have an opinion about gun control, then you may enjoy this movie.  I read Grisham's novel, and although it was about tobacco, the premise is the same:  when things go wrong, someone with money should have to pay, whether it be the tobacco companies or gun manufacturers.
After you watch this movie, think about the entire picture that was painted by it:  Gun manufacturers and people who support guns = BAD.  People who are against guns = GOOD.  Throughout the movie the people who were on the gun manufacturer's side would go to any length to win the trial.  The people against the guns played straight,legal, and morally uncorrupted.  Even the final scene, with our ""heros"" watching the children play, was straight out of the liberal bible: always bring in the kids for an emotional boost for your audience.
Such blatant liberalism ruined this movie for me.  Again, if you're liberal, or if you're against guns, or you just don't care either way, then this is a fine movie.

What I do know is that the movie is highly entertaining and has a first class cast.
A firearms company is sued by a widow whose husband was murdered at his office, along with several other  people, by a deranged ex-employee. The argument for the lawsuit is that the gun producer ""pushes"" its products in illegal ways, making it extremely easy for people to get assault weapons. The end result in some of these cases is a loose cannon that cannot be stopped. The defense hires Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman) as a jury consultant, while the lawyer for the plaintiff, Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman), is not interested in this kind of service at all and is skeptic to accept it when it is offered to him. From the onset of the trial the viewer can perceive the highly sophisticated methods that jury consultants use in selecting the twelve people which will finally decide the outcome of the trial. In this case, things will go a bit further, when controlling the jury becomes a game of power and the action heats up to considerable levels.
The performances of Hackman, Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and John Cusack, who plays one of the jurors, are highly commendable.  It is curious that Hackman and Hoffman never worked together in a movie before, and for this reason the director decided to create a ""special"" scene for them in which they could display their talent together. I recommend that after watching the movie you watch the special features about this scene (""The Washroom""). I understand that this movie may be annoying for people who are extremely in favor of the right to bear arms, but if you do not belong in this category, you will probably find it enjoyable.",1078444800,3,1861,4.552238805970149

The motives of the characters that were in the book fit the structure of that story but their motives in this film does not fit the story of this film because in reality gun owner ship is gray subject, and you know no one is trying to hide anything in this debate.

1971302,3,B00014NF02,"Taking sharp aim at the the judical process, ""Runaway Jury"" captures your attention from the very first moments of the movie. Dustin Hoffman plays Wendell Rohr an attorney in a case representing a woman whose husband was murdered at work by a former employee. His lawsuit has suddenly become the focus of the media and Rankin Fitz (Gene Hackman) a jury consultant who has been hired by the gun manufacturers to manipulate the selection process of the jury in their favor. There's a wildcard that no one banks on; Nickolas Easter (John Cusack) a member of the jury will sell his services to the highest bidder and, in the process, also turn the jury in favor of whomever pays him and his girlfriend Marlee (Rachel Weisz) $10 million.
John Grisham's novel of the same name has been turned into a tense, suspenseful courtroom drama that has the aura of a spy thriller; we're kept on the edge of our seat guessing both the outcome and the motivation of Easter and Marlee. Director Gary Fleder keeps the pace energetic preventing the film from falling into a predictable genre film. The screenplay credited to Brian Koppelman, David Levien, Rick Cleveland and Matthew Chapman is surprisingly cohesive and sharp despite having passed through so many hands. Hackman and Hoffman's famous showdown in the men's room of the courthouse is little more than icing on a very rich cake. While their single scene together generates considerable sparks, the film could have done just as well without it. It reminds me of the Michael Mann's ""Heat"" and the single scene that Deniro and Pacino share together in the film. It's really the gimmick or the hook to hang the rest of the film on and draw in an audience. Just a warning, though, that Grisham's original novel has been altered significantly to focus on the trial of a gun manufacturer vs. the cigarette manufacturers. If you're a gun advocate, you'll probably find the film lopsided and too liberal.
Hackman's portrayal of Fitz as an amoral, manipulative sleaze is a role he's played before but that doesn't stop him from pulling out all the stops. He brings both larger than life qualities to Fitz but also lets us see how what he does for a living diminishes him as well. There's a flawed human being at the core of this amoral monster. Hoffman as Rohr brings vitality to what could have been a one-note performance. Hoffman as Rohr flirts with the same demons that have drawn Fitz into his own amoral hell. Hoffman's twinge of a southern accent took a bit of getting used to at first as it recalls the same vocal inflections Hoffman used when playing Tootsie. It was distracting during the first couple of scenes involving Hoffman. I kept expecting Hoffman to turn up in court in drag.
Cusack's Easter occupies the eye of the hurricane and like that eye he's just as enigmatic; we never really know what's going on inside his head. Since this is a thriller what Cusack withholds is as important as what he shows us about Easter. Weisz captures the hard-bitten quality of Marlee as she pimps her boyfriend's vote. She's a credible negotiator and a believable foil for Fitz and his cronies. The excellent supporting cast consists of the always interesting Bruce Davison as the improbably named Durwood Cable the attorney representing the gun makers; the versatile Bruce McGill as the hard Judge Harkin; Jeremy Piven as jury expert Lawrence Green and a host of fine character actors in pivotal, supporting roles. The casting is amazingly strong and helps give added heft to even the least developed characters.
The transfer looks beautiful capturing the golden colors of fall perfectly. The handsome transfer looks vivid with nicely balanced colors. Whether or not you view the pan and scan version or widescreen, the transfer has been meticulously handled to capture all the warm colors of Robert Elswit's cinematography. I saw very few digital artifact problems. The sharp and clear sound transfer does justice to the nicely detailed score by composer Christopher Young.

The whole high tech side of gathering information about the jury is really ridiculous and should be put in a spy film other than a court movie.

The acting is the only plus here, and in a way, a sigh of what could have been a much better movie.

Only the performances are worthy of some praise, and the actors themselves should be commented for giving their all to this movie, even when the movie does not giver them a fair chance to work with something with substance. Rachel Weisz is simply fantastic as Marlee, a woman who would stop at nothing to control the jury and Gene Hackman gives another great performances as Rankin Fitch, a sleaze bag Jury Consultant who would do anything to win the case he is working on. Hackman and Weisz make you care about what is happing to them, even when you stop caring about what is happing in the movie. They are supported by a fine cast of supporting actors including John Cusack, Dustin Hoffman, Bruce Davison, and many others.
It's sad that Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz did not have a script to support their talent because I would like to see them pared up again, and they do work great together because their scene on the trolley is amazing, and it shows that good actors can save a bad movie with a couple of good scenes.

While I liked the human aspect of it, the whole gun control angle is a bit wasted in its own muddled mixed message that not only contradicts itself in certain aspects but also takes away from the story at hand.  The human side of the story though did move me, and I give credit to the actors for at least giving there all for this movie to work. Gene Hackman gives a sense of loss and humanity to an other wise villain role, and even though he does get his comeuppance in the end, you just feel sorry for him anyway. Rachel Weisz gives a strong and human performance to her role, and literally carries the movie on her shoulders. I agree with the majority that she and Hackman are the heart and soul of this film. Dustin Hoffman is great as well but does not have as much promenade as expected and John Cusack is very good, and he hold himself well with the other actors in the movie.  The movie as a whole feels a little too rough to be considered a complete movie, and the way it cuts from scene to scene feels too frantic to take with any clarity.

There are jury consultants who help lawyers pick juries, but they do not operate like in this movie. A person CANNOT get on a jury like Cusack did, just to try and arrange a verdict.  All of these people were guilty of jury tampering, which is a felony, but no no one ever acts the least bit concerned that they might go to jail. What was the point of all this as the gun company could have easily gotten a new trail because Cusack lied duing his jury exam and apparently gave a phony name, ID, etc. Also, what was Jenifer Beals doing in this movie?  She was on the jury, but never spoke a word (that I remember) and really had no part at all.  Was her part cut from the movie?",1077667200,,789,4.137254901960785
1971315,3,B00014NF02,"This is a typical Hollywood story of guns in our culture.  At the heart of the story is the notion that the gun companies are so evil that they are not willing to stand for independent jury verdicts.  As a result, they must manipulate the process so it will benefit them.  However, one interesting component of this story is missing: there is a murderer who used a gun to kill the widow's wife.  That person is not shown--not at all!  That person is absent!  All you see is an anonymous figure, in the beginning of the movie, coming into kill a stock broker.  No mention at all throught the film is made of the person who killed the widow's husband.  Is he in prison?  If not, why not?
There is a specific reason for that, of course.  Hollywood rarely likes to focus on murderers.  When they do, they always play them as the victims.  As a result, then, we have a movie that says the guns -- absent any individual initiative -- was able to kill a person with malicious intent.  Therefore a jury verdict is the only avanue left available to attack the so-called evildoers.  If this movie served as the basis for one's views on gun control, one would think that guns are only used for the purposes of attacking people, not defense, which is the primary purpose.
I must say, however, that there have been some incredible performances in this movie.  Gene Hackman plays an incredible performance as the ""evil"" fire arms attorney / supervisor of jury tampering.  I felt that Hoffman's performance was terrible and was a signal of poor casting.
Another problem I have with this movie is that it fails to understand that by attacking the gun companies it has a direct impact on individual's ability to bear arms.  If trial lawyers are able to enact enough damages upon manufacturers of said weapons, it would raise costs to prohibitive levels that would ultimately passed down to consumers.  If the price of gun is increased 400%, that decreases the opportunity for the average person to exercise their constitutional right to own such weapons.  That appears to be the apparent point of the movie -- to make it as difficult for someone to exercise their right to own such weapons that the average person, while still holding the same right to bear arms, cannot actually afford to do so.  Of course Hollywood writers and actors will always be heavily guarded in their mansions in Bel Air, Beverly Hills, and Upper-East Manhattan, but what about the rest of society?

Hackman is mesmerizing as the wicked Rankin Fitch, an evil, unethical jury consultant who wins at any cost. John Cusack and Rachel Weitz are a couple of amature cons out to beat Fitch at his own game. Yes, the morality is very black and white, not much grey, which makes the movie play more like a tale rather than a geniune story plucked from the headlines. But the cast is top notch, even bit parts are played by people like Orlando Jones, Nora Dunn and Jennifer Beals (I got a kick out the the momentary 80's hero intro, flashdance girl meets boombox boy).

1971318,4,B00014NF02,"Based on the John Grisham book, Runaway Jury is a fine court thriller in the same vein as The Pelican Brief and The Firm. However, as oppossed to those films, it's much more predictable, and that takes a lot out of the movie - how much can you be thrilled if you *know* what's gonna happen?
A big guns manufacturing firm is taken to court by the widow of a stock broker killed by a deranged co-worker using an automatic weapon built by said firm. As you would expect, it's the biggest trial to come along in some time as there are large interests in its results. The victims want some retribution for their loss, but if the gun companies lose it will set a precedent from which many future cases can also be lost. Both sides bring in the big guns (pun intended) not only hiring top lawyers to handle the case (Hoffman and Davison), but also hiring jury selection firms to watch over the pciking of who's gonna be one of the twelve jurors. Enter Rankin Fitch (Hackman), an expert in manipulating mury selection. He uses leading edge technology and a large team of people to figure out any and everything there is to know about the jurors, and if necessary, put enough pressure in them to guarantee a winning decision.
One of the would-be jurors is Nick Easter (Cusack), a part owner of an electronics store, who seems to have his own reasons to be part of the jury. Once the selection starts and both sides do their best to include jurors who they think will favor them, or to exclude those who would vote against their clients. However, they don't realize at first that Nick is doing some manipulation himself. With the help of his girlfriend, Marlee (Weisz), Nick manages to be chosen as juror #9, and once he's in, him and Marlee start threatening both sides - they can make the decision swing to either side, whoever pays them more will be on the winning end. From then on, most of the movie reveals Nick's and Marlee's plan as well as how the lawyers react, trying to stop them.
There is a somewhat decent twist ending, although as I said before, it's quite predictable and that's the real weakness of the film. I had already read the book, but by wife, who hasn't, also saw the ending coming a mile away.
The big plus in this film is the acting. The four leading characters are portrayed by two Hollywood legends with four Oscars between them and two great actors of a younger generation. Cusack is argueably the lead, as he has the most screen time. His character drives the story - he's the one on the inside, moving and shaking things in order to control the outcome. He does a real good job. Weisz has probably the least screen time of the foursome, and she does very well with a limited character (she is, however, quite hot!). Hoffman does a fine job as Wendell Rohr, the plaintiff's lawyer, who wants to win this case to change gun control laws and to stick it to the large gun companies. But the movie belongs to Hackman. He is the villain of the film, he's the bad guy in the story, and as with most movies, he gets the best dialogues and the best scenes. He's a canniving, heartless man who knows that in order to control people you have to learn their deepest, darkest secrets and then use them against them. He doesn't care about the victims or the people involved in the trial, he only wants to win and he shows it when he says ""someone always loses in court. Only not me"".
If you're a Grisham fan (either his books or the movies based on them) you shouldn't miss this film. If you like court room dramas, you'll enjoy this movie. Just don't expect to be blown away by it.
On a final note, has anyone else noticed that this is Hackman's third Grisham-based movie? He was in The Firm, The Chamber and now this. Odd.",1077667200,4,3732,4.402315484804631

This film solves a lot of potential problems by giving us an all star cast to watch.

Dustin Hoffman plays the plaintiff attorney, Gene Hackman is a ""jury expert"" who is hired to put together a jury which will deliver a verdict in the defendent's favor.  John Cusack and Rachel Weisz are lovers who work from the inside, once Cusack gets on the jury.
Cusack is the real key to the whole plot, as both sides are really unsure what his motivations are.  By the time everything is clear, one of the sides will have made a huge mistake.

While the anti-gun message is a tad heavy-handed and somewhat overplayed, I hardly think one can say that this film celebrates jury tampering.  Either that or I've been corrupted by watching too many films from the ""left-wing liberal media"".
Anyway, Gene Hackman's character makes the movie - he's nasty, he's brutish, he's intelligent, he's invincible and then he gets his comeuppance - pure fairy tale stuff.  Hoffmann never really tugs at the heartstrings too much - can one ever truly feel sympathy for a lawyer?- and Cusak and Weiss inhabit a moral grey area, where bad things happen too them but it's kind their fault for not being angels themselves and then at the end of the movie we realize they are angels and Santa Claus exists and that must be the tooth fairy knocking at my window.
What I mean to say is that the ending is trite, rushed, mawking, horribly sentimental and pretty much destroys a really elaborate set up.
The most intersting thing I found about this movie was when Hoffman and Hackman come face to face in the Men's room after Hackman has made Hoffman's key witness disappear.  Normally in movies this leads to a big physical showdown, with the wronged party opening a can of righteous vengance flavored whup-ass on his nemesis.  Here though, refreshingly (or perhaps because Hoffman looks a foot smaller than Hackman...) the two decide to argue it out, in an honest and frankly quite moving way.  I have to say I was touched.
File this movie beside ""Enemy of the State"", ""Identity"" and ""The Life of David Gale"", and mourn the fact that John Cusack only gets wet once - and even then he's wearing a raincoat...",1077494400,5,1802,4.704761904761905

The gist of the movie is that a man with wife and young son is killed when a wacko decides to seek revenge on anyone he can get in his gun sites in the office of the company that he feels wronged him.  The widow decides to make a point, money, and her 15 minutes of fame by going after the gun manufacturer.

I happen to believe the right to bear arms, so this whole crusade turned me off.  Reading some other reviews, it seems that in the book, the law suite was against a cigarette company.  I guess that Hollywood felt that guns would be more politically correct.  In addition, we're being told that it's OK for the lawyers to pay the 10 million to have the jury fixed.  The lawyer for the widow considers paying the money and the lawyer for the gun company does.  Even though the money is paid, we find that the folks trying to fix the jury had no intention of doing anything other than trying to get the gun manufacturer found guilty.  It seems that several years ago they had lost someone to a random shooting, so they feel it's OK to break who knows how many laws to make those evil gun manufacturers pay.
So, let's see, we have a tirade against our 2nd amendment rights, a message that jury tampering is OK if it's for the right cause, and that there is no honor among thieves.",1077494400,2,1802,4.194202898550724
1971324,4,B00014NF02,"If you enjoy movies like ""Class Action"", ""12 Angry Men"", ""The Juror"", or ""The Pelican Brief"" you should love this one. As a big fan of Grisham I did. The cast is perfect. I was impressed by John Cusack's, Rachel Weisz's, Gene Hackman's, and Dustin Hoffman's portrayals. Good sets, music, and director make it all the better. This case involving a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer may arouse Charlton Heston and pro NRA people up in arms, but it's the manipulation of the jury that is the real story. Granted the book was about tobacco not firearms, but the tobacco industry has been beaten to death so they wanted a new horse to beat senseless. The wrong horse unfortunately. Trying to make me blame a gun manufacturer for a psycho taking an automatic weapon to his fellow employees is just ridiculous. It makes about as much sense as if you sued a company for manufacturing sweets for making people fat. I agree with firearm advocates they took alot of license in trying to make people feel firearms should be outlawed, but I did like the story about paid groups studying juries to predict or influence their vote. We watch as the jurors are carefully studied for secrets that may make them willing to change their verdict. Hackman, Cusack, and Weisz are the key figures. All the rest the cast does a good job in their supporting roles.
Although we don't see a great deal of the jury interaction, we see enough to get a good feel of the jurors sentiments and their secrets. This is one I will add to my listmania of Great Courtroom Movies and personal DVD collection. It is ashame that this movie was not appreciated as much because it used a gun manufacturer in a class action suit. Perhaps if they had chosen another manufacturer that causes death it may have received more positive attention. What impresses me most about this movie when I reflect on it is how they show jurors being profiled. We have let lawyers badger us blue about profiling their clients, but it is perfectly acceptable for them to profile jurors. If you have ever been on jury duty you know only to well how this movie does not go to far beyond what is true about profiling jurors. Especially in any precedent setting case. Go sit in on lawyers interviewing a potential jury sometime. See if you don't think their questions are profiling the jurors.",1077494400,,2327,4.6231884057971016

A hard thing to do considering that you really don't care after a while about what is happening on screen.
I usually don't agree with the majority but I really do in this case. See it for the good effort made by Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz for at least doing their best to keep you interest in the movie.

1971327,4,B00014NF02,"I already reviewed this movie, but wanted to just post this follow up after reading some of the other reviews:
A lot of people would be turned because they would see the film as only an anti-gun message. However, in this case, it seems to fit. Like one question the prosecutor asks of the gun manufacturer ""You're advertisement for this gun says it has a print resistant finish"". The gun guy says, yes, it resists finger prints cause finger prints are mostly water and water will rust the surface. So the prosecutor says ""well, then why didn't you say it was a rust-resistant finish""? Gets back to the whole arguement that the only people needing a print-resistant finish are criminals. Little things like that. They talk to some store salesman, who sold hundreds of these guns to the SAME GUY and never asked him any questions. It'd be like, if every month, I walked into a gun store and bought 25 beretta's and nobody asking me what the heck I was doing with all the guns. I mean, isn't it WIERD to have somebody buy 25 of the SAME gun every month, month after month? It turns out the guy was buying them legally, then turning right around and selling them illegally for like 3 times the price or something like that. All these ""businessmen"" knowingly looked the other way when they darn well knew some illegal stuff was going on.
One of the jurors makes the case ""so what next? sure fast food cause you're fat?"" (ironic huh?). Anyways, I'm against the overall pursuit of the gun manufactures for their product alone. Just like you shouldn't sue Absolute, or Coors, when you drink too much and crash your car. Just like you can't sure the car company for selling a car to a drunk driver. I don't think, generally speaking, that the gun manufactures should be sued. People need to take responsibility for their own actions and QUIT TRYING TO BLAME EVERYBODY ELSE BUT THEIRSELF!
My point is, even if you don't like guns, or even if you do like guns, the evidence in THIS ONE PARTICULAR movie, makes that ONE PARTICULAR gun manufacturer look like they were knowingly breaking the law. So, rent it, and enjoy it. And then discuss it amongst yourselfs. Then write a review :)",1077494400,3,2172,4.5717948717948715

Meanwhile, Easter's girlfriend, Marlee (Rachel Weisz), tries to swindle the attorneys (Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman) to pay millions of dollars to have the jury return a verdict friendly to their clients. The case involves the widow of a man killed in an office shooting suing the gun manufacturer of the weapon that was used, under the claim that they knew the store that sold it was not obeying the laws about firearm sales.
When I heard that Runaway Jury was going to be made into a movie, I was thrilled.  Then I heard that the story line was going to be based on guns instead of the tobacco industry.

1971330,3,B00014NF02,"Director Gary Fleder has previously made several mediocre Hollywood thrillers that incidentally glamorize violence. Now he turns one of John Grisham's best novels--an intricately-plotted thriller about jury-tampering in a tobacco trial--into a mediocre Hollywood thriller that shamelessly propagandizes for the gun control lobby.  Has he suddenly grown some sort of conscience?  Or tumbled into the sack with Sarah Brady, or Ed Asner, or ...?
It's too bad this production got carried away with preaching to the converted, for it sabotages Grisham's splendid story and a first-rate cast for the sake of it's ham-fisted anti-gun political agenda.  Gene Hackman is excellent (as usual) as the professional jury-rigger.  John Cusak and Rachel Weisz are nearly as good as his amateur nemeses.  Unfortunately, Dustin Hoffman demonstrates again that his best days are far behind him with another competent but uninspired performance.  (What's with that accent?)  And a strong supporting cast (including Bruce Davison, Nora Dunn, Bruce McGill, & Jeremy Piven) is mostly wasted in this misguided adaptation.

1971333,4,B00014NF02,"While I am sure this film will spark some heated debate on the whole gun control issue, I think that was secondary to the real message of the film which I feel has more to do with personal conviction and ethical choices than the gun case.  What will we ultimately sacrifice to get the justice we feel is deserved?  Where are the boundaries we will cross to ensure the greater good is done?  Will our personal convictions outweigh our desires for the results?

Some great actors are involved here, including Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack, and Gene Hackman.  On the surface it is a film about a jury trial where a widow is suing a gun manufacturing company for the wrongful death of her husband, who was killed at work by an ex-employee with an automatic weapon produced by the manufacturer.  The trial itself is about whether the gun manufacturer has liability for the use of its products.  An interesting question and one that looks deep into the heart of justice, and the 2nd Amendment.  Is it an issue of ""rights"" or an issue of ""responsibility""?  A good question but one which is not answered here, despite the seeming intention to do so.

As I said, despite the context of the gun control trial, the real essence of the film for me was the ethics of the lead characters.  Gene Hackman plays a person who flies in under the radar of a trial and sways and influences juries through blackmail and other illegal threats and intimidation.  He is paid millions to deliver verdicts for the gun companies.  Dustin Hoffman is the defense lawyer, who has sound principles and even struggles with adding a jury expert on his own team. The scene between Dustin and Gene is a classic confrontation of principle versus results at any cost. John Cusack is a person who is seemingly reluctant to be a part of the jury process, yet ends up in a strategic role as ""juror #9"".

Some choose to stretch their morals for good, some stand firm.  The true value in this film is the interesting look at some difficult moral dilemmas.  Recommended highly.

However, here is the fine print.  This film is pathetically biased to the Left.  One of the best (likely inadvertent because they just don't get it) portrayals of the type of media bias conservatives are always complaining about comes at the end of the film.  Watch closely.  When the jury verdict is announced inside the courtroom the reaction is decidedly mixed.  Shock and anger, including one person standing up yelling ""that's BS"", and much indignation from the defense side, while the plaintiff side erupts in celebration. The point is that this is clearly depicted as a very mixed reaction - that was part of the Hollywood emotive sequencing there.  Cut to outside the courthouse, and we see what looks like a Network reporter saying into camera: ""Spontaneous celebration throughout the courthouse at the verdict today which will put gun manufacturers...etc"". Clearly implying that it was a verdict that was unanimously supported by everyone. Simply amazing that liberal Hollywood so openly displays what happens everyday in America - one sided and news biased to the left.

Gene's performance made his character more dimensional than it needed to be, and more though provoking, and Rachel Weisz gives a great performance with a character that really should have had more screen time than she did. Dustin Hoffman was fine but was really no more than scenery and John Cusack was decent but needed more work.

There are a few places where the viewer is required to suspend belief because of plot lapses, but generally this is a fast-moving, interesting film which gives a chilling look at the possibilities of influencing a jury in order to favor certain interest groups.

Bad old cigarette manufacturers are last years news. People (children) getting killed by guns is today's news.

I'm also enthralled with American jurisprudence, jury selection , voir dire, etc. I'm becoming a John Cusack fan with every movie I've seen him in.

Runaway Jury is a perfect example of this ideal, and you can look no further than the performances giving by all who participated in this film. Gene Hackman is no stranger to this notion, and gives a great sense of class, and humility to an other wise cookie cutter bad guy. Rachel Weisz not only holds her own with the big boys but literally makes them sweat in the acting department as well. Giving both Hackman and Hoffman a worthy adversary in and out of the courtroom, and making them know that they are not going to steal the movie by themselves. And Dustin Hoffman brings a sense of heart and humanity to his role, which sadly is not very big to begin with. All the supporting actors do well themselves with John Cusack, Luis Guzman, and Bruce Davison giving great support. Judging by the talent involved, you will guess that this might be a great movie but it's not. That's because the screenplay, the editing, and the director betrays them and their performances with a film that feels very unfinished, and amateurish to say the least.  The story, which deals with guns, is really not about them but about the state of which one will go for messing with the legal system. It's a noble story to tell but when you are hammering the idea of gun responsibility, and accountability to the viewer with out equal say about the benefits, you are in trouble, and you can thank the screenplay for that. The editing feels way to raw to be a real final cut, and the direction feels too disjointed to be even considered professional.
With all these problems going for it, it's the showmanship of Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, and Dustin Hoffman that moves the film forward, but they should not have had to work that hard to save this bad movie.

Grisham is an excellent writer, but if he wanted to make The Runaway Jury a movie he should've stood by his work and stuck with the original issue of the tobacco industry in Biloxi and not an entirely separate issue of gun control in New Orleans.

I could get into the pros and cons of the gun issue right now but what can I say that has not been already said. I just want to point out that the issue needs a better forum than this movie, which bear in mind does not do ether side of the equation any justice.  The only thing that I could give this movie any credit for is the acting which bear in mind is the best thing about it. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz do wonders with a movie that is more show than tell, and to both of their credit, they are the only redeeming factors this movie has. John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman are good as well, and the rest of the casts make due. The story is not based on anything that John Grisham has done with the book, and in my opinion lies the biggest problem with this movie. Why change the tobacco story for a moratorium on guns? Was it from pressure for the Tobacco Company or a hidden agenda to attack gun?",1077235200,4,1135,4.044444444444444
1971353,3,B00014NF02,"This movie is about as objective as one of those old Soviet era circa 1960's propaganda films only the performances are first rate.
I always enjoy a good Hoffman or Hackman film. They are masters of the craft. But the script and story line is not even thinly veiled anti-gun propaganda.
The ""good"" guys are Hoffman, Cusack and Weitz. Hoffman is suing a gun manufacturer for the actions of a deranged nutcase who shot up his old employers offices and killed 11 people ( if you consider stock brokers people that is - hahaha just kidding). The victim - Dylan McDermott did not even get cast billing - wonder why - possibly because he saw a pre-release cut and wanted his name off it?
Anyway the ""bad"" guys are Hackman and his bunch who will use KGB, CIA and FBI (with more resources and manpower than any of those mentioned organizations) to manipulate or threaten the jury to get them to go their way.
The poor old ""good"" guys eschew all of that in then name of honor and protecting innocent citizens from those murdering gun mongers.
This was based on a John Grisham novel. In the novel the bad guys were tobacco executives. Now that Big tobacco and Government have become virtual partners they are no longer bad guys. Now those evil gun guys are responsible for all the murder and mayhem in the world.
Handgun Control Inc could not have done better had the written and produced this movie instead of indirectly using nonsensical and false statistics about the carnage of guns on our society. If they numbers used in this movie were accurate, the country would be de-populated by 2010
The ""bad"" guys are all rabid screming maniacs with no credible arguments. The bad guys are all corrupt and even the pro-gun juror come off as uncaring idiots.
I mean this is blatant propaganda, worse than blatant.
Even at the end we are not given any insight as to the reasoning behind the verdict or the award, we are all just expected to believe that Easter convinced them all with them all to do the ""right thing"" to ""stop this epidemic of gun violence"".
Whatever your views are on the gun control maybe especially if you support it, this movie does not present your case very well, the message is too sophomoric.
I did enjoy the performances; there was a great cast of wondeful talent even Peter  ""my dear Mr Garibaldi"" Jurasik and Jennifer ""Flashdance"" Beals and as always Rachel Weitz is wonderful.
I am still curious about the total lack of any mention of Dylan McDermott ( formerly of The Practice) even in the closing credits.

The plot of this one involves, big surprise, lawyers, and the jury selection and tampering that goes on when a giant gun manufacturer is being sued by a widow whose husband was killed with one of their assault weapons. Although the premise is slightly different for something from this author (or at least as different as he chooses to get), it all ends up coming back to the same old things, the similar story line formula being rehashed once again.
All of the performances here are weak, and the entire cast seems uninspired with their thinly written characters. John Cusak is one of my favorites, but he acts as though he simply does not care in this one, as does the usually reliable Rachel Weisz. Gene Hackman overacts here as usual, and Dustin Hoffman continues to play the exact same character he has in his last 20 movies, so there is nothing new to see in his abilities here.
The direction in ""Runaway Jury"" seems to be inspired by the look of a made-for-TV movie, with cheesy shots galore, one has to wonder if the director did not just graduate from the school of making sappy chick flicks for the Hallmark channel.
This movie will not bore the hell out of you, as there is enough here to keep the viewer interested, although the plot is predictable, even if you have not read the book.

Hoffman pales in comparison to the might Hackman, and comes off short in their scenes together, which is in fact more of a script problem than a talent one. The only actor in the movie that gives Hackman a worthy acting counterpart is Rachel Weisz, who not only gives Hackman a run for his money in the acting department, but almost outshines him as well.

1971367,4,B00014NF02,"Now another John Grisham novel comes on to the screen, and though the film's story is implausible, it remains a slick legal thriller all through.  This time again it is set in New Orleans, but differs greatly from ""Time to Kill"" at one point: Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman in the same film.  And the film is not about the case itself; it's about the jury, or the system of jury.
""Runaway Jury"" starts with a lawsuit against a gun maker whose munitions happened to have gone to the wrong hand of a criminal, who killed a loving husband.  Gene Hackman's Rankin Finch, top-notch jury co-ordinator for the defence, armed with high-tech profiling system stands for the company while Dustin Hoffman's lawyer Wendall Rohr rises against them with his only weapon: his creed.  But when they have to select the 12 people for the jurors of the case, one unexpected factor is thrown in, in the shape of John Cusack's juror Nick Easter, who acts very strangely.
If you want to fully enjoy the film, don't read on, and just see the film.  When Rachel Weisz also steps in, you are pretty sure what is really going on behind the door, and probably what you guess is right.  All I can say is that ""Runaway Jury"" can boast two great actors Hackman and Hoffman, but its story is, slick as it is, pretty incredible to most of us as it goes on, and Cusack and Weisz, though playing the key roles, should have been more interesting characters.
You get supporting actors like Luis Guzman, Jennifer Beals, Nora Dunn, Bill Nunn, and Cliff Curtis as the jurors, but mostly what they do is (except for Curtis) very small.  Actually I almost failed to notice Jennifer Beals is there.  And you also see these reliable actors like Jeremy Piven or Bruce Davidson, but the film seems to forget thet they are even standing there before tha camera.
Director Gary Fleder is always keeping a good pace, and it is a surprise that they included some comments about an on-going social issue like guns in USA.  But the fact is, the original book included a tabacoo company, but probably because of ""The Insider,"" the filmmakers switched tabacoo to gun.  This change could have made the film more political, but perhaps wisely (or not) it relies on its speedy development of the plot, not on  this social matter, to make itself very hot.
See it as a thriller, and though the story is often too unbelievable, it gives some gripping moments, and great acting from the two leads.",1075680000,3,2437,4.592165898617512

The whole jury tampering was a bit out of control, and a bit comical considering the fact that it could have been expose in a heart beat if it was based in the real world. The whole high tech side to the movie just did not cut it for me, and the whole evil of capitalism was way out of place. On the plus side, the acting is very good considering the unfocused script in this film. Dustin Hoffman and John Cusack were very good but the real stars here are Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz who are the heart and soul of this movie. They alone make this movie better than its many faults, and the movie has many. I was more riveted by Hackman and Weisz confrontation than the confrontation between Hackman and Hoffman because there were more tension between him and Weisz, and it was better executed than the tacked on bathroom scene with him and Hoffman which seem forced and unnecessary.

All the flair of the righteous few but no real solutions to help the real problems at hand, which is the case with this well intention but really flawed movie.  It's easy to see the ramifications of the violence other to see who is really responsible because of the need to identify with the victim, which is noble but flawed because we are can be easily blinded by our outrage and need for justice. The makes of Runaway Jury would rather make a moratorium on outrage other than a platform for conflicting views, and it's the viewer who pays for it in the long run because it gives a very simple answer to a very complex, and not very simple problem.  Despite the flaws of this well-meaning exercise in righteousness, it's the performances that are really the real reason to digest this movie. Gene Hackman plays this character all the time, but he does it so well that you don't mind seeing him do it again. Dustin Hoffman is just as good as well but it seemed like he was just following on Hackman's coat tails in certain scenes even though their big face off in the mens room is a classic.

You root for her all the way, even when her motives and politics are not really fully explain.

1971376,5,B00014NF02,"Runaway Jury is a suspenseful behind-the-scenes drama about high stakes jury tampering.  Set in New Orleans, the story deals with a multi-million dollar lawsuit against gun manufacturers, brought by a widow whose husband was shot to death.  The gun cartel hires jury consultant Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman) to guarantee they don't lose the case.  Fitch knows what he's doing:  He has a crack team of researchers, spies, and techies analyzing the jurors' lives for potential black-mailing.  Enter reluctant Juror #9 (John Cusack) and his mysterious girlfriend (Rachel Weiss) and the action really takes off.

Gene Hackman is superb as the ruthless and unscrupulous Fitch.  He is utterly convincing as a powerful and sophisticated villain we love to hate.  On the other hand, Dustin Hoffman's performance as the prosecuting attorney is weak and forgettable.  John Cusack has a chronically sleepy-eyed expression and, while satisfactory, could have been replaced by a number of other actors, such as Dylan McDermott (who, unccredited, opens the story with a thrilling murder scene.)  Rachel Weiss was excellent as Cusack's tough co-conspirator.  The outstanding direction by Gary Fleder pulls all the action together and makes it a winning film.

What I like most about the film was the constant level of suspense and the way the script gives just enough information to keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for all the pieces to fit together.

1971377,5,B00014NF02,"THIS REVIEW IS BY A JOHN GRISHAM FAN WHO HAS NOT READ THE BOOK. I thoroughly enjoyed this film despite my criticisms at the end of this review, although I did debate whether to round my rating up or down. However, I concluded that the casting was excellent and that several of the performances (including those by Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman - two of my favorite actors) are good enough to merit an overall rating of five stars. The characters are interesting, the story is fast moving although with a generally predictable plot despite a few surprise twists, and the actors complement each other well. I am sure that I will enjoy watching this film several times, although I will have to see it again before deciding if it rises to the level of wanting to purchase the DVD.
The storyline is very straightforward. The widow of a businessman killed during a shooting rampage in his office decides to sue the gun manufacturer for negligence in the distribution of their products. (Do guns kill or do people?) Attorney Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) believes he has a very strong case (perhaps even some smoking gun testimony) that actually raises the odds that he might be able to overcome the industry's unblemished record of previously successfully defending against all lawsuits trying to establish manufacturer negligence and liability in such incidents. As the trial approaches and jury selection is about to begin, enter Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman), jury consultant extraordinaire for the defendants. (Hometown lawyer against city slicker.) We also meet Nick Easter (John Cusack), a seemingly reluctant juror whose plan to influence the jury with the help of his friend (accomplice? business partner?) Marlee (Rachel Weisz) gradually unfolds. As the trial proceeds the intrigue intensifies and it is not clear whose manipulations will eventually succeed - Nick and Marlee or Rankin Fitch. But it is quite clear that this trial is about a lot more than twelve men and women deciding the case only on the basis of unbiased testimony introduced under oath in the courtroom.
My reservations and criticisms are as follows. First, this film is meant to deliver an in your face message about the justice system (it is being manipulated) and the gun manufacturers (they are just uncaring, greedy businessmen). In fact, the industry involved in Grisham's novel was tobacco, but since they've now basically lost their battle it is apparently time to target guns. It could have been nuanced and informative, instead of straight propaganda. Second, I would have loved to see this cast in a modern day version of TWELVE ANGRY MEN. Instead, most of the manipulation takes place outside the jury room, and the methodology of Easter's supposed ability to control the deliberations themselves was shortchanged. Third, near the end Fitch and Easter's abilities became so extreme as to become unbelievable. Fourth, the conclusion is basically totally feelgood as an offset to all the intense emotions that we have experienced; it is foreshortened and simplistic.
So, if you want realism and subtlety, this movie will not be a five star experience for you.  But if you want a film with excellent performances, a story of some complexity, and an exposition of the flaws of our justice system by a knowledgeable and articulate storyteller (Grisham), then you should enjoy this film as much as I did.

They lie, cheat, steal and bribe in order to achieve the ""greater good"" of winning a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer.  To go along with the protagonsits' rationale for sleazy, crimnal activity, you have to accept the idea that gun companys are the modern equivalent of Nazi death factories.

This movie touches an important topic that's relevant to everyone of us: gun violence. In addition to delivering fun and entertainment, this movie takes a serious look at gun issue, such as illegal selling of assault weapons and easy access to guns by criminals.

We do have two great performances that do wet the bottom of the mouth in the form of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, who makes this meal of a movie full of flavor. Weisz is great as Marilee, the mastermind of the whole scheme, and Gene Hackman is picture perfect as Rankin Fitch, the jury consultant who would stop at nothing to secure his verdict. Dustin Hoffman is fine as Wendell Rohr, and he does a fairly decent southern accent, and John Cusack is a fairly good Nicholas Easter, and captures his mystery to a tee.

1971384,3,B00014NF02,"The plot goes round and round in ""Runaway Jury"" and the camera is in lockstep, swirling around its actors as if they stood at the pivot of a merry-go-round, dizzying the audience into a headache of chaos, the better to distract them from a movie that makes no sense at all. That said, the story is so thorough in its cynic fantasy it is (like, say, ""Cruel Intentions"") pretty entertaining.
Gene Hackman, who at 73 never slows down, is sternly malevolent as Rankin Fitch, a high-priced jury consultant whose arsenal of espionage tools and recon foot soldiers rivals the KGB. The ""war room"" scene where he breaks down his potential pawns is informative; though nobody is going to spend $15 million to select 12 people - as movie contends - there is an art to it, and the technique is laid out far better here than it was in ""Devil's Advocate.""
Fitch assists a New Orleans gun manufacturer caught in a class action lawsuit only plausible in movies, and one of the jurors, Nick Easter (John Cusack), and his girlfriend, Marlee (Rachel Weisz), are blackmailing both the defendant and the plaintiff, represented by Wendall Rohr (Dustin Hoffman). Nick and Marlee claim they can sway the jury and sell the verdict to the highest bidder. As the plot unfurls it becomes possible that they aren't trying to buy anything, but play a con, backed by a Moral. That's a sweet proletariat consideration, but in terms of doing justice, it's robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Director Gary Fleder (""Don't Say A Word"") is far more devoted to winding us up than meditating on the legal system; with cinematographer Robert Elswit, Fleder jerks and spins and speeds and slows and generally makes a drama soup out of things; New Orleans, one of the truly original cities, is merely background.
Stuffed to the brim with action, ""Runaway Jury"" is economical and workmanlike, like Grisham's thrillers, and a strong vehicle for performers. Hackman, borrowing from his magnificent work in ""The Royal Tanenbaums"" is a fine rascal, and Cusack hasn't been this shifty since ""The Grifters.""
The surprise? It's Weisz, as the feisty brains of the operation. She holds her own with Hackman, which is more than can be said for a broken-down, weathered Hoffman.",1067817600,20,2216,4.849604221635884

Its great to have such heavy weight actors involved, and John Cusack hold himself well but its Rachel Weisz who literally steals the film from all three of them with her great performance. She is real reason to see this movie, even when the movie itself is not really worth it.  She is so good in fact that she should have had more to do than the three other leads who are giving too much screen time in some parts or another.
See it for Rachel Weisz and the rest of the cast but don't hold your hopes up for a movie as good as the book",1067817600,10,869,4.046511627906977
1971386,5,B00014NF02,"Based on the bestseller by John Grisham, ""Runaway Jury"" is, without a doubt, one of the finest and most thrilling Grisham adaptions ever made since ""The Firm"", ""The Pelican Brief"", ""The Client"", ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Chamber"", and ""The Rainmaker""! ""Runaway Jury"", to me, is also, by far, a slick and intense thriller that reminds us as to why we go to the movies in the first place! The direction of Gary Fleder (""Don't Say A Word"") is brilliant and powerful! The performances of John Cusack (""High Fidelity""), Rachel Weisz (The ""Mummy"" films), and Academy Award-winners Gene Hackman (Best Supporting Actor, 1992: ""Unforgiven"") and Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor, 1988: ""Rain Man"") were top-notch and commanding, especially the performances of Hackman and Hoffman, who, in real life, were former roommates and have known each other since 1956. And, on another note, Hackman is no stranger to Grisham territory, since ""Runaway Jury"" is his third Grisham film (The other two were 1993's ""The Firm"" and 1996's ""The Chamber"").
""Runaway Jury"" calls the attention to a case that is involving a major gun manufacturer. When a young widow (Joanna Going) in New Orleans brings a civil suit against the powerful corporate consortium she holds responsible for her husband's (an uncredited Dylan McDermott) murder, she sets in motion a multi-million dollar case. But it's a suit that may be won even before it begins -- based solely on the selection, manipulation, and, ultimately, the attempted ""theft"" of the jury. Representing the widow is Wendall Rohr (Hoffman), a courtly Southern lawyer with a moral center and a heartfelt passion for the case that he's presenting. His opponent is ostensibly the attorney representing the corporation. But in reality, defense counsel is only the front man for Rankin Fitch (Hackman), a brilliant and ruthless jury consultant. At a high-tech command center set up in an old French Quarter warehouse, Fitch and his team work on the surveillance and assessment of potential jurors. He will know everything about their lives, and strategically manipulate the jury selection process. The only acceptable result is the perfect jury to vote in favor of his client. Fitch and Rohr soon realize that they're not the only ones out to win the jury. One of the jurors, Nick Easter (Cusack), seems to have his own plan for swaying the panel. And a mysterious woman known only as Marlee (Weisz) contacts both Rohr and Fitch telling them the jury's for sale to either of them -- and that the verdict won't come cheap. While the case is argued in court, a cat-and-mouse game begins to play out in New Orleans' French Quarter. Rohr's morality is put to the test, and Fitch is poised to cross the line from selecting a jury to stealing it -- no matter who gets hurt in the process. And, to Fitch, it's all in the name of securing a favorable verdict.
In conclusion, ""Runaway Jury"" has outstanding performances from Cusack, Hackman, Hoffman, and Weisz, especially the scene-stealing performances of both Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman in a memorable scene together! ""Runaway Jury"" also has a strong supporting cast, including Bruce Davison (The ""X-Men"" films), Bruce McGill (""The Sum of All Fears""), Jeremy Piven (""Serendipity""), Jennifer Beals (""Flashdance""), and the two uncredited appearances of Dylan McDermott (TV's ""The Practice"") and Luis Guzman (""Anger Management""), in which they gave great performances as well. The film also has slick, fast-paced suspense and an excellent and powerful storyline. ""Runaway Jury"" is John Cusack's best since ""Identity""; Gene Hackman's best since ""Unforgiven""; Dustin Hoffman's best since ""Rain Man""; and Rachel Weisz's best since ""Chain Reaction""!

Without giving anything away it can be said there is an elaborate plot which could never occur in real-world jurisprudence under most ordinarily conceivable circumstances. The story (of this adaptation, NOT of the original novel) is weak in that regard and makes the film a hard-sell due to the expected and anticlimatic resolution.
Midway through the movie, the director seemed to have gotten carried away in a semi-doozy theme regarding the right to bear arms which overshadows all common sense. At one point, an idealistic man is even willing to bend the law to achieve his ""right"" goals.
Regardless, the tense Hackman versus Hoffman showdown is by far a reason enough to watch this thriller, there are enough moments between the two veterans to make the ride worthwhile.

1971396,4,B00014NF02,"I was already unhappy when I discovered that the film version of John Grisham's ""Runaway Jury"" would be about handguns rather than cigarettes.  It seems that Hollywood can have two movies about talking pigs in the same year, one of which gets nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, can have two movies about large objects hurtling towards the earth that can make hundreds of millions dollars in the same summer, and can do dozens of movies in which an old person and a young person switch bodies, but heaven forbid that anybody make another movie suggesting tobacco companies are evil since ""The Insider"" proved that.  There is an in-joke early in the film ""Runaway Jury"" about the change, but all it made me do was wonder how much money Big Tobacco would have paid not to have Hollywood take them to task in a big budget film with Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman.
Now that I have actually seen the film I am unhappy for another reason.  Having significantly altered the subject matter of the film, director Gary Fleder substantially changes the style as well.  In addition to being an indictment of the tobacco industry and their lawyers, the novel ""Runaway Jury"" was pretty much a serio-comic version of ""12 Angry Men,"" where the fun was in watching Nicholas Easter put the pieces of the jury together to get the verdict that he wanted.  However, the film version is more about the machinations of jury consultant supreme, Rankin Fitch (Hackman), with his legion of flunkies and technological toys.  Fitch deserves to be taken down, and taken down hard, which is an important part of this film because the legal case against his client is pretty unrealistic and given the problems with the star witness of Wendell Rohr (Hoffman), the plaintiff's attorney, it is a good thing the scriptwriters (all four of them) are around to help set things to right.
The film version goes for suspense instead of manipulation, with Mr. Inside Easter (John Cusak) and Ms. Outside Marlee (Rachel Weisz) lacking the confidence that gave the novel quite a different tone, and their lives, not to mention their plan, in considerably more peril.  Besides, Marlee and Nick are playing both sides against each other, so for most of the film there is no sense of the moral high ground and we are led to believe this is just another way of playing the game of law.  So Cusak, who should have several choice scenes in which he proves his mettle, is given more physical action than dialogue, Hoffman sounds a lot like Dorothy Michael's brother, and it is Hackman who repeatedly steals virtually every scene that he has in the film.
To say that ""Runaway Jury"" is a disappointment to those who read the book is a rather insignificant point given that most of the people who see it will not have done so, and they should find this 2003 film to be pretty engaging since they do not know the inherent flaws.  However, I would urge you to go read Grisham's novel, which is not as funny as ""The Rainmaker,"" but in a similar comic vein.  I do not know if Grisham is as upset with what happened with his novel as Tom Clancy was when Hollywood played with the ending of ""Patriot Games,"" but if he is not I am still rather ticked off about the whole thing.",1067126400,3,3217,4.618213660245184

I think it insightful that they don't bother to mention the actual subject matter of the script in the trailer, even though it turns out to be the founding theme of the entire movie; almost as if they're afraid the truth will stop you from going in the first place - they're right; I wouldn't have! As a movie about a court case, it's just fine, but all that is drowned in a sea of idealogical presentation where the case against gun ownership is clearly and even eloquently, at times, spelt out by the applicable legable representative. Neither surprisingly nor unpredictably (sad to say) however, the other side's case never really gets aired except with continual distractions and cut-aways; all one ends up with is some vague references of defending the 2nd amendment simply because it's part of the constitution, rather than the self-defence reasons that are more important to most people. The usual tug-on-the-heartstrings hopes to turn off your brain so that you'll just allow yourself to be spoon fed their version of this issue.
I don't like being taken for a fool, and I'm left having to wonder - if they think their case is so strong then why are they so afraid to give the same amount of 'air time' for the 'rest of the story'? Oh, and, of course, the only real bad guy on the jury is an ex-marine.

Therefore, the verdict at the end looked more like jury revolt, ala O.J. Simpson (a tired theme), than jury tampering (the point of the story).
The film maker should have stuck with the tobacco manufacturers, as in the book.  But I suppose this would have dated the movie.

Hackman and Weisz were especially outstanding. Cusak was perfect for the role. A number of minor characters on the jury and at Hackman's control central were pitch perfect. Marguerite Moreau hit all the right notes for Hackman's assistant--a very small but standout role. Hoffman's part could have done with more shading, a bit more darkener taken from the original book. I considered him a bit flat in this role. I'm not sure he found his footing as he seemed to be going for stereotypical Southern gentleman lawyer.
