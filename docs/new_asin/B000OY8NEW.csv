8187310,4,B000OY8NEW,The information in this documentary is compelling. You'll probably be surprised. The only reason I didn't give the film five stars is because of the poorly lit film-work.,1393891200,,170,5.107142857142857
8187311,5,B000OY8NEW,This is basically a movie/documentary how the police and other law enforcement dudes keep tabs on poets and rappers and their inner and outer circles and their where-abouts probably for no good reasons. Some of the lies and cover-ups. The take home of this movie is why are they doing this? Its because they can. Its worth checking out!,1314403200,3,336,4.711864406779661
8187312,5,B000OY8NEW,Really enjoyed this movie! It gets to the heart of the matter of what the Feds and the cops don't want the general population to know about.... The director does an incredible job bringing center stage what most officials would prefer stay behind the scenes. A must see!,1185408000,4,270,4.645833333333333
