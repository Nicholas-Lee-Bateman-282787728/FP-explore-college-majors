7991743,3,B00009MEE6,"This is odd and as the back cover describes ""unique"". The workout combines TaiChi, martial arts and dance - which is why I bought this because it sounded like a lot of fun. You do the workout barefoot and are supposed to ""connect with and feel the energy"". Throughout the entire workout, you are going from one side of the room to the other. The dance is kinda weird and several times I felt as if I was at a rave. Periodically, the instructor incorporates martial arts movements which was cool. This workout is not for those with back problems as there is tons of bending.

The workout is done to music and a voiceover from the instructor. I think I would have liked it better if we could have just listened to her as she instructed the class. The class consists of different ages, races, body types, etc. They appear to be enjoying the workout. They don't always seem to know what the instructor is doing however, and I found that very distracting. The instructor is quite pretty, but you hardly notice since her hair is always in her face. The setting is an art museum.

After the credits, the instructor explains and demonstrates each movement. I wish I would have watched this first and it definitely should have been put on a separate feature of the DVD menu instead of after the workout. Also at the beginning of each workout (there are 3: warm up/cool down, basic and intermediate), you have to watch a mini-commercial for the Body Mix workout collection. You can easily fast forward through this, but skipping this chapter will not take you right to the beginning of the workout.

I give this 5 stars for originality, but somehow it doesn't seem to work as a video workout. I bet it would be lots of fun to take as a class. It is interesting enough not to totally dismiss it though, so I will try it again a few more times.",1127347200,5,1832,4.446428571428571
