7607884,5,B01ARY02XS,"Living Hope is a wonderful documentary about three people who changed their lives to help and serve people in South Africa.  I was moved and greatly inspired by all of these people. They are doing as the Lord tells us, to serve the sick and poor.
  John Thomas, a pastor who with his church are helping the sick, hungry and dying.  In this DVD you can find out why they are helping the sick and poor and meet some of the people that they have helped. How through this program they are bringing many souls to the Lord.
  Joey Lankford a very prosperous businessman and father of four. He had everything anyone could want, but something was missing from his life. God spoke to him and Joey followed the Lord. They moved to Cape Town and Joey is helping the people with job skills and helping them get out of poverty. I really was inspired by this young man and his wife. He really has a heart for the people and doing the will of the Lord.
  Leonie Rustin, is a single mom and she is an assistant nurse. She was very addicted to drugs and doing her own thing. She is an amazing lady. Leonie really loves the Lord and the people who are around her that are addicted to drugs and prostitution. She tries to help as many as she can to come clean and live a decent life.
  All three of these people are doing a mighty work for the Lord and His kingdom. It is so inspiring and amazing what a person can do if they just try. As long as you have God on your side you can do anything.
  I highly recommend this documentary. You will be blessed just by watching it.

8748047,4,B01ARY02XS,"This movie, at its simplest, appears to be about missions. More correctly its about, in the words of Mother (now Saint) Teresa, Christians going to the poor of South Africa to love Jesus. And she implies, when you see the hungry, the naked, the sick, you are seeing Jesus in disguise. So love --  them.
The setting is the Capetown area, including Oceanview where one in three women and one in four men test positive for HIV, the average life expectancy is under 50, and the infection rate is 44%. This is a story of men and women, who with these statistics in their heads were compelled to take their families from the comforts of home to the social battlefield thousands of miles away.
Ill let you discover the players for yourself, but suffice it to say, that each one had to surrender to Gods will one day at a time not knowing what God wanted them to do tomorrow. We share in their agonizing and from that come some memorable thoughts.  When Joey Lankford was concerned about what his wife would think about taking the family to Capetown, his father comments, If God is calling you to the mission field, you won't need to sell the idea to your wife. How true that is and how different from those men (in particular) who wrongly drag their wives and families there only to meet defeat and discouragement. Courtney Lankford needed no selling. She was just waiting for Joey to catch up to her.  Later in the movie, in reference to how her marriage with Joey was strengthened by their ministry in S.A., we hear Courtney observing that When you take two people and put them through a trial, they will cling together for dear life.  Joey on the other hand, who was always worried about his wifes happiness and his responsibility for it, had to hear and accept these words from God: Her happiness is not found in you anymore; its found in Me; Ill provide.
The film addresses the age-old dispute about the social gospel (Christian faith practiced as a call to social reform) vs. the salvation gospel (Christian faith practiced in pursuit of helping people make personal conversions). John Thomas clearly answers the question when he says, I thought Jesus wanted me to save souls; I discovered He wanted me to save people.
Thomas is the founder of [...] and the rest of the film showcases the four areas of ministry Living Hope focuses on with some gut-wrenching true-life stories that will amaze you.  There is Living Care (focusing on healthcare); Living Grace (focusing on the homeless and those dealing with addiction); Living Right (HIV/AIDS education and prevention); and Living Way (Economic Empowerment).
In the Living Care section we experience the story of a lady dying of AIDS who fought Christianity for a long time until one of the team finally got through to her. She held on and eventually wanted to get baptized but moving her anywhere was out of the question. What happens next, just six days before she dies, will, I believe, impact each viewer immensely and unforgettably.
My favorite part of the movie is that of Dana Perino, currently an American political commentator and author, and the 27th White House Press Secretary, serving under President George W. Bush. She was there when the President selected Living Hope as one of two faith-based organizations eligible for grants under a stop AIDS in Africa program he implemented. Dana tells the story and shares her feelings when she and her husband went to serve with Living Hope after her W.H. stint. Her presence, at least for those of us who watch her regularly on television, helps us click with the reality of Living Hope in todays world. She asks, If you have the means to help people (the pill for AIDS), don't you have a moral obligation to give it to them? And thats exactly what Bush did through so many organizations. When the President met John Thomas, he remarked, Ive always wanted to meet the pastor of the one local church that the U.S. government funds.
Throughout the movie one could feel the dependence on prayer shared by the team and those they were working with. From the seed project in Living Way to the provision of funds for a major surgery of a workers wife  another moving story in itself, prayer made the difference.  And then theres a fourteen-year-old mother with AIDS who named her baby (born with advanced stage of AIDS) no hope.  Can you imagine being at such a point in life, that this what you do? Living Hope staff saw this as just an amazing opportunity to minister to this young lady in a way that enabled her, months later to remark, You people showed me Jesus. And then asked to be taken down to the registry office to officially change her childs name to The Lord Is My Hope.
Many churches would do well to show this movie one Sunday morning instead of their regular program, warning people that it won't be a 30-minute sermon that day.
The players have one final piece of advice for us  if you're going to do this kind of thing, you need to do it properly. You start by spending a lot of time with God.
For most of us, I recommend starting with seeing this movie. If after seeing it, you still feel like pitying those poor missionaries, youve missed the point. Being a missionary in this kind of setting, is rather something to be envied  for it is there, one gets to really see God at work.

8748048,5,B01ARY02XS,"My thoughts:
Living Hope is an amazing documentary about an amazing organization. One thing that is amazing is that it started out as a local community church. They became aware of many needs and problems in the community and followed God's lead to do something about it. In Capetown, South Africa, one in three women is HIV positive. One in four men is HIV positive. It is pandemic. There is a food shortage that causes hunger to be a regular, intense problem. There is poverty that is not even definable by United States standards.

There are four main ministries that Living Hope is involved with.

Living Care ~ Care for the sick and the dying
Living Grace ~ Care for the homeless and substance abusers
Living Way  ~ Trains the jobless, trains and equips to grow food
Living Right ~ Teaches AIDS prevention, provides testing, provides support club for young people

8748050,5,B01ARY02XS,"Living Hope takes an indepth look at a mission located in South Africa. It was started by Pastor John Thomas and the film looks at the impact this mission is having to an entire community. There are four branches to their mission. One deals with homelessness and drug addiction. One of the people we meet in the film, Leonie, is a former drug addict who now helps get help to others. Another part of their program deals with the high HIV/AIDS infection in that area. Medicine, support, and education are all part of that program. There is also a branch that works to get people jobs and help them become self-sufficient. Lastly, the have a former hospice turned clinic to support the community with their medical needs. We meet a family who decided to go in to missions and moved to South Africa to work at Living Hope. Overall I found this DVD impactful and highly recommend it.",1465516800,,879,4.569620253164557
8748051,5,B01ARY02XS,"Living Hope is a feature length documentary about John Thomas, Joey Lankford & family, and Leonie Rustin, who have served the poor and shared Christ's love in South Africa, where problems of poverty, malnutrition, HIV infection, drug & alcohol abuse, and prostitution abound. The average life expectancy there is less than 50 years.

John Thomas is the founder of Living Hope, a Christian organization that seeks ""to reach people for Christ, bringing hope and breaking the despair of poverty and disease."" (taken from the website) Living Hope encompasses 4 ministries: Living Care (helps patients and their families through a health care center and home-based care), Living Grace (helps the poor, the homeless, and substance abusers through free rehabilitation, homeless ministry, and food share program), Living Right (helps prevent the spread of AIDS and HIV through support groups, testing & counseling, and life skills education), and Living Way (helps equip the poor and the unemployed through job center, Way to Work program, and agriculture & business training).

Joey Lankford, a successful businessman from Tennessee, was unhappy with the direction he was heading so he decided to surrender all to God and seek His will & purpose for his life. He and his family moved to South Africa. Joey helps equip people with sustainable tunnel (greenhouse) farming to provide for their own families and operate it as a business.

Leonie Rustin, a single mom and recovering drug addict, found Living Grace, surrendered her life to Christ, and now is active in sharing her story & helping others in her community to find freedom from drug addiction.

Living Hope, narrated by Joel Smallbone of For King & Country, is a powerful & inspiring documentary film that will make you think of your life's purpose and how you can be artisans of hope in this dark world. It also features Michael W. Smith and Dana Perino (former White House Press Secretary and FOX News host). I love the fact that Living Hope is gospel-centered and through Living Hope's ministries many lives have been transformed. You will hear touching stories of a few people who have been helped by Living Hope. We, Christians, are to be the solution through our daily kingdom-living and Christ-representing. I highly recommend this excellent documentary!

8748052,5,B01ARY02XS,"I am not always a fan of documentaries, but this is a well made film that draws you into the lives of the people who have been impacted by Living Hope Ministries. The stories were not necessarily connected, but were smoothly woven together to give an overall view of the impressive work being done by those who simply want to love Jesus through others, and how the results have made a difference that keep giving. I loved the way Living Hope is split into 4 ministries that deal with specific issues:

Living Care -  Healthcare
Living Grace - Homeless and addiction
Living Right -  HIV education and prevention
Living Way -  Economic empowerment

 'Living Hope' also features President George W. Bush, Dana Perino and Michael W. Smith with narration by Joel Smallbone of King and Country and was created by the filmmakers David Kiern and Mitchell Galin.

It follows and interviews three people who have given their lives to the cause of taking care of the people of South Africa by providing ministry in four needed areas:

  Healthcare
  Homeless and addiction
  HIV education and prevention
  Economic empowerment

Living Hope provides guidance in four ministries  seeking to impact South Africas Southern Cape Peninsula with a holistic approach that works to support those both affected and infected by HIV and AIDS, and other chronic diseases  as well as several other contributing factors. - See more at: [...]

We meet Joey Lankford a husband and father of four, Leonie Rustin a single mom coming out of addiction and Pastor John Thomas all who are doing God's work after various circumstances took them to South Africa.

I love how Leonie Rustin has helped herself in her own recovery. Friday's used to be the night she would do drugs so to stop herself from getting caught up in that she busied herself by cleaning and readying the make-shift church; an classroom that serves as a place for mass.

Along with these people we get to know Amy Aaron an RN who talks about families who thank the staff for taking care of their family members, making them comfortable, respecting them and loving them. The story she tells of 31 year old Nizzy Way who was very very sick with HIV and had refused God in her life. When she talks about Nizzy's baptism before she passed I cried.  Beautiful! Why go into nursing or ministry if you don't care about people?

These people are putting 100% faith in God as do I and this DVD will have you rethinking your life and what you can do to change the world around you.

The DVD is very well edited. I loved it.",1464048000,,1803,4.616352201257862
8748054,5,B01ARY02XS,"Ever considered being a missionary or head out on a missions trip to South Africa? You might want to check out Living Hope, a documentary on the lives of three missionaries who each have found hope in the darkness of despair in the DVD release from Word Films.

Living Hope is the story of three extraordinary individuals who have devoted their lives to serving the poor in South Africa. It is a feature length documentary of about 90 minutes created by the filmmakers behind Journey to Everest, Apostles of Comedy and Honoring a Father's Dream: Sons of Lwala.

We see the stories of John Thomas, a pastor who is leading his church to serve the sick, hungry and dying in the communities that surround them. Journey beside John through the neighborhoods where they work, meet the people their ministry has impacted, and hear from his heart why they chose to make a stand for the poor.

Joey Lankford, a businessman and father of four who moved his young family from the United States to Cape Town. Journey beside Joey as he equips men and women with job skills and leads them out of the bondage of poverty.

Finally, Leonie Rustin, a single mom and nursing assistant, who turned from a life of crippling drug addiction to follow Christ. Journey beside Leonie, as she attempts to help others in her community to unshackle the chains of addiction and prostitution.

I received Living Hope by Word Films compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation aside from a free copy of this DVD in exchange for my personal and honest evaluation. This documentary is perfect for any one considering entering into becoming a missionary or considering taking part in a missions trip to South Africa. Narrated by Joel Smallbone of For King and Country, this is such an impactful moving film that shows Christians taking on the task of helping the poor, destitute and the needy as Jesus commanded. When others question the motives of Christians, they need not look far to see how people are helping around the globe and these are just three of the remarkable people who gave up their own lives to help others find purpose in theirs. This is Dove family approved and winner of 5 doves from the Dove Foundation as well as the winner of the Great Commission Award from the Attic Film Festival in 2014 as well as the Official Selection in the UK Christian Film Festival in 2015. For me this one resounds with a 5 out of 5 stars.",1462838400,2,2471,4.632420091324201
