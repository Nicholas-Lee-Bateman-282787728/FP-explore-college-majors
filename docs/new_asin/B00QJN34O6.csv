6872977,4,B00QJN34O6,"I enjoyed it overall. I do like the animation and the style of all the Marvel Knights entries. However i think part 1 of the Wolverine vs Sabretooth is better than this one. o say this cause after this one was over it felt like it was kinda short and it didn't give any closure at all. seriously there are no real answers at all in this. I was hoping to see answers to all the mystery from the previous disc that came before this but it just ends abruptly and with no real meaning.  i mean its enjoyable but nothing that i had hoped for based on the huge tease they gave prior to this. Im not sure how the comic went that this is based on but it just feels like they took the lazy way out and didn't even really want to do the story properly.
I should have seen it coming tho when the price for this new entry was cheaper than any others. they could have done SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS considering the potential with what the built up instead they just forgot all that and were like ""eh i guess we need to get this over with""

If you like the Marvel Knights animation then you will love this as that continues.

If you were looking for answers to all the questions and mystery posed from the previous episodes...nope none of that here.",1427932800,5,1236,4.141666666666667
6872978,1,B00QJN34O6,"If you like this type of animation then balls to the wall for u. But if you don't, the watch the preview online, get disappointed, then get upset because you realize that you haven't seen a properly animated Wolverine since 2009 WatXM. (I'm not even gonna try to explain the fail that was Wolverine Anime.) Yes, this style is different and unique, but my big problem is the fact that the biggest $$tar of the Marvel Omniverse has been reduce to paper cut out animation.
Marvel, and its employees, have a chance to double down on all there characters. Movies and cartoons on TV, they could dominate. I digress. It just seems that if this whole marvel Knights thing was any good, somebody would have picked it up for a TV show, at least 13 episodes? Oh yeah black panther.
Don't buy this movie, unless ur that guy who loves it. You know who you are Rick!",1427846400,4,852,4.43312101910828
