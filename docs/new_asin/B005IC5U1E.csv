8474499,3,B005IC5U1E,"I don't know what it is about Mary Wanless. I think she's smart and she has some great information, but I find her difficult to watch/listen to. I've purchased several DVDs and I want so much to like them, but I watch them partway through and I'm bored. Maybe it takes too long for her to get to the point? And, even though I love that lilting English accent, I soon find my eyes glazing over and my mind wandering. But, maybe that's just me. The information she's providing is definitely worthwhile, but I find myself going back to her book for most of the information on her videos.",1413331200,3,584,4.36697247706422
