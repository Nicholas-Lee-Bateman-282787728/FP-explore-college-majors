8122708,5,B000FI8MKC,Possibly the best of these videos I've seen yet. The V2 launch sequence is worth the cost of the video alone.,1474243200,,109,4.238095238095238
8122709,4,B000FI8MKC,"Highly informative information was included in this video, although, the speaker was somewhat dry.",1433635200,,98,6.071428571428571
8122710,4,B000FI8MKC,"This is a well done documentary on German jet and rocket development during WWII.  The film is a bit slow in places as it
goes over, in too much detail, how the V2 rockets were prepared for launching.  Fascinating to learn that most of the jet plane
development started in the late 1930s and was gradually refined during the early 1940s.  Biggest problems Germany had were
shortages of critical materials needed to manufacture the jets, buzz bombs and rockets.  Still, the V1 eventually led to our
development of the cruise missile, and the V2 rocket the world's booster rockets and ICBMs.",1395100800,,589,4.801980198019802
8122711,5,B000FI8MKC,"This is just not long enough It does give you a little taste but its just a little tease, some good stuff about some of the first jet
fighters,just not enough,boy I just love this kinda DVD  just wish it was a little longer !!",1372118400,,226,4.022222222222222
8122712,5,B000FI8MKC,This is a good addition to your war library.  I learned a few new things and saw some new footage.  I would recommend this.  Especially for the price.,1370390400,,150,4.285714285714286
8122713,4,B000FI8MKC,"Stunning footage of the first combat jet aircraft, the Me 163 and the Messerschmitt 262.

Heinkel's pioneering efforts and his pre-eminent He-280 are acknowledged, the Komet is shown in flight (scary!), and the A-4 rocket receives plenty of coverage, especially the complex launching procedures. The Me-163A, the most radical aircraft of the war, reached a speed of 623 mph, when released from a bomber. Me-163B pilot Schubert shot down two B-17s in one sortie, and some of that gun camera footage is shown. 1400 Me-262s were produced and only 200 served in combat, later in the war than they could have, but those few changed aviation forever. These planes could have been in the air 2 years sooner, but the Luftwaffe envisioned a short war, and these types were not seen as a design or production priority. Hitler's insistence that the plane be a bomber, not a fighter, was not what that kept it from earlier service, but Juncker's inability to design the new JU-004 Jumo engines under difficult conditions, e.g., no nickel, chromium, or aluminum.

Along with the Wings of the Luftwaffe series, this program, Luftwaffe Nr. 7, is the best I've seen on Luftwaffe jets.

Correct title, from the program itself, is ""German Jet Fighters, German Jet Bombers, and V Weapons.""",1369526400,2,1270,4.953051643192488
8122714,4,B000FI8MKC,"If you enjoyed Discovery Channels ""Wings of the Luftwaffe"" 15-20 years ago,
You will love this documentary. Much new/old newsreel, and propaganda footage
of the 'wonder weapons'. Very well done. A must for aircraft, or military
history enthusiasts.",1278374400,,248,5.552631578947368
8122715,4,B000FI8MKC,"The video footage contained in this DVD is quite interesting. Footage covers the Komet, ME 262, VI and V2 and Arado jet bomber. With respect to the ME 262 there is footage from trial and prototype runs as well as footage from a training film. The training film is quite interesting in that it provides footage showing not only flight of aircraft but interior controls and how to handle. The footage for the V2's is quite similar. Footage is provided not only for experimental trial runs and live launching but also from a training film intended for crews handling these weapons. The training footage shows all aspects of a typical operation, from movement to assembly to final launching. Both the novice and those with considerable knowledge of this aircraft would find this footage quite interesting. The footage of the Komet, Arado and V2 is not as in-depth but still impressive in showing how these aircraft were launched and operated. Again, very interesting not only for the novice but also the expert.

The DVD not only contains very good video footage but also some analysis regarding strengths and weaknesses of aircraft, problems in production, etc. Although this knowledge is not in-depth and would be pretty well known by anyone with more than basic knowledge of this hardware it would be of interest to the novice. The analyses presented of the hardware is more in-depth than anything that would normally be found in documentaries found on the Histroy, Discovery or Military Channels.",1266278400,7,1496,4.984
8122716,4,B000FI8MKC,"I love WWII ""Victory"" Weapons seeing how they are the genesis of our own US Space program. This video has some great footage of them.",1258848000,2,133,4.36
