Surely, anyone who loves Boris Godunov knows, admires, and likely swears by his 1952 E.M.I. recording. I sought an alternative to a staged death scene when sharing this with older friends. From the first moment of the farewell and death scene in this concert performance, without any of the visuals associated with live opera, I was not just blown away, I was shattered inside out. Christoff was a giant. A volcano full of all the accumulated drama of the opera erupted full force from the very opening second. A friend reacted that this was simply the greatest performance she had ever seen or heard.

The interviews between opera highlights are intelligent and very worthwhile. Christoff was an articulate, sensitive man with much to offer. His study with another great singer, Riccardo Stracciari, shows the connection between generations of great artists. Five stars is inadequate to the pleasure I get from this recital. I am personally grateful to those who made it available.",1498089600,,1060,5.0227272727272725
8060553,5,B0009GV9NC,"Are you impressed by the king who died upon the appearance of the young prince in Boris Godunov by his acting and singing? Are you impressed by this successor of Chialipin,  the singer whose repertoire is the widest (Italian/German/ Russian) whose influence is far and wide? If you do, you can't miss this one.

Here Boris Christoff will share with you his musical background; and how he compares and mixes Russian with Italian singing; what makes Italian singing supreme; and what diction and phrasing mean in singing; how he termed an opera classical or modern; what operas he has the highest esteem for, and how he sees Mussorgsky... In between each  short interview, we will be able to hear him sing the excerpts under discussion which are all in colour and in good sound.",1129766400,12,776,4.776119402985074
