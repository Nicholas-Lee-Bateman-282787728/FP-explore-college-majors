7562804,5,B0194XTVIA,It arrived promptly and I have to admit was binged watched right away.  It's an amazing series that gets the time and culture perfect!!!  It's sort of a Downton Abbey from mid century Australia!!!,1491264000,,196,4.735294117647059
7562805,5,B0194XTVIA,"my husband and I are completely addicted. We keep turning to each other and saying "" I didn't see that coming!"" Excellent writing and acting.
Very happy to have found this. Can't wait for the fifth season to begin.",1489968000,,214,4.512820512820513
7562806,5,B0194XTVIA,Family saga with a lot of surprising twists and turns!  Looking forward to season 5.,1489622400,,84,4.6
7562807,5,B0194XTVIA,"Oh my word! Downton Abbey, move over! APTCH 1-4 is very well done. Season 5 will be out late 2017- early 2018. The settings used are beautiful places in NSW, AU. The 1950's are captured accurately. There is a minimum of contrivance because the characters are fully flushed out and viewers see their good qualities and their flaws. The series' themes deal with love and hate, good and evil, the cost of war, gay shaming, antisemitism and post WW II changes that are impacting Australia. Some accuse the series of being ""soapy,"" but I contend that APTCH is much more than meets the eye.",1488412800,,584,4.625

7562809,5,B0194XTVIA,Tthe story keeps one in suspense. The back cover did mention sexual situations. Which were too explicit for my liking.,1487721600,,118,4.95
7562810,5,B0194XTVIA,I bought this for so many people!!  I LOVE THIS SHOW!!  Cannot stand the villain but thats how it goes in all shows....,1486684800,2,119,4.130434782608695
7562811,5,B0194XTVIA,This is almost the equal to Downtown Abbey in terms of capturing you and immersing you in the story. I was amazed that they could do that with a smaller cast than DA. We've watched all four seasons and are eagerly awaiting the next which I hear will start filming this month (Feb 2017).,1486598400,2,286,4.314814814814815
7562812,5,B0194XTVIA,"Do not miss a single episode. One season carries over into the next. Season 4 can also be ordered. Its all good, no, it is better, it is Aussie AWESOME viewing. Ive loved it from season 1. Perfect in every way. Australia 1954, Ash Parks rich mingle with ordinary locals. Like an Aussie Upstairs Downstairs or an Outback Downton; good-on-ya. Well-developed characters that have grown to be family to viewing fans. Marta Dusseldorp (Janet King & Jack Irish) sets the bar high with her lead as Sarah. There are a dozen actors that have been key since the 2013 inception. If you are new to A PLACE TO CALL HOME then buy from the beginning, don't miss a single episode, now at 45 and counting, thats including season 4.
I'd rate it 6-STARS if it was allowed.

All seasons have SHD SUBTITLES,
ANDSeason 5 is being prepared as I write this review. Im betting it will out-last Downton.",1486166400,2,877,4.550632911392405

7562816,5,B0194XTVIA,"Picture and sound is much better than PBS, colors have pop to them.
Can't wait for season 4 to come to the States and see how the plot plays out.",1484697600,,145,3.8666666666666667
7562817,5,B0194XTVIA,"I am totally hooked on this series.  I had been watching the series once a week on PBS, but they cut Season 1 short, and then it was gone.  Now I can watch to my hearts content.",1481587200,2,177,3.7567567567567566
7562818,5,B0194XTVIA,Excellent! Can't wait until the Season 4 comes out,1480896000,,50,4.666666666666667

7562821,5,B0194XTVIA,"I am totally taken by this series.  Regrettably, Season 4 is VERY difficult to find outside online streaming, which provides poor video clarify and equally bad audio.  I will purchase the Season 4 DVD set when available.  I look forward to Season 5, which I believe is due to arrive in 2017.  The writing and intrigue is superb.  The social issues of the time are handled deftly with compassion and an understanding that actually might not have been so prevalent in the 1950s.  Bevan Lee is an excellent writer and the actors/actresses are superb.",1477440000,14,547,4.76595744680851

8743950,5,B0194XTVIA,"Perfectly enthralling.  Though set in the '50's the issues are relevant today.  Beautifully written, acted and filmed.  Arrived earlier than expected and that is excellent.",1499990400,,172,5.8

8743953,5,B0194XTVIA,"Best TV drama since Downton Abbey. Downton fans will love this. So many great and interesting characters. I love all of the characters and love to hate the nasty ones. The actors and actresses are simply amazing. I found myself cheering for some, outraged at others, and got so involved with them and the storylines! I just ordered Season 4 and can't wait for it! You'll be hooked on this series for sure.",1496793600,,405,4.561643835616438
8743954,5,B0194XTVIA,"Great series, highly recommended.",1495584000,,33,7.5
8743955,5,B0194XTVIA,"This series is a combination of ""Downton Abbey"" and ""The Big Valley"".  I bought it, despite watching it every week (Must-See TV) on one of my local PBS stations (WLRN - Miami, FL).  I'm binge-watching it now, seasons 1-3, and when I'm done, I'll probably start all over again.  The acting is superb, the story lines amazing, and the DVD production by/with Acorn is very well done.  The version I have is PAL, which was a bargain for seasons 1-3, bundled, but I'm sure it's also available in a region 1 version.  As for the IMDb-type information, that's available so many other places, I'll skip it here.  Watch episode one, and you'll be hooked forever.",1494633600,,653,4.6347826086956525
8743956,5,B0194XTVIA,A PLACE TO CALL HOME was one of the BEST movies I've have seen in a very long time.  Thanks!!,1494115200,,93,3.65
