1022352,5,6305426651,"I do not like subtitled films, so was hesitant.  DO NOT BE !
This is a joyous, funny, beautiful, poignant, story that truly touches the heart and more.
This reminds us all that every aspect of life has good/bad, positive/negative and no matter how terrible we can be as humans, we can be equally precious and uplifting.
It received much acclaim... Not enough for me... I was moved deeply and delighted !",1521504000,,403,4.597222222222222

1022359,5,6305426651,"Loved the film - I watched it for the first time while visiting Arezzo, Italy,  where it was filmed years ago.  Don't be deterred by the English closed captions.  The acting is fast-paced and engaging - you will love the story and will soon be drawn in.  Lots of funny and poignant scenes and a happy/sad ending that will leave you wanting more.  The parents' love for their darling son and each other is truly inspiring.",1518652800,,421,4.4868421052631575

1022555,5,6305426651,"This is one of those films that many filmmakers struggled with in light of the humor directed at the Nazis and the holocaust. Even Spielberg allegedly walked out upon seeing it. Interestingly, some twenty years before, Jerry Lewis attempted a similar film, but then held it back for fear that people were not ready for it. It was titled: ""THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED"". It has still never been shown to the public.",1509753600,4,409,4.616438356164384

As the granddaughter of a WWII gulag survivor, it touched me in a more personal way than some folks probably, however, I believe it is an amazing film in its own right. To me, this epitomizes love at its finest--that a child's innocence and a spouse's hope would be worth risking your own life for. 1 million stars for this film forever. I hope this goes down as a landmark piece of cinematic history.",1501027200,2,533,4.34

1022734,5,6305426651,"This movie is also my all time favorite--ever!!  Mr. Benigni wrote it, directed it, and stared in it along with his real life wife.  He based it on his fathers experience who was in the Italian army and spent two years in a Nazi concentration camp (the Benignis are not Jewish).  His father, as to not scare his children, told them his experience with a bit of humor.  This movie was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.  I can't think of another foreign film so nominated. It did win Best Foreign Language and Best Actor for Benigni. Who can forget him leaping over the chairs to accept his award.  I wish everyone would watch it in the original language or you will miss hearing  Principessa.  I think of this movie as a lesson in how one looks at life. Kind of a glass half empty or half full.  To take tragic events in ones own life and change how you perceive them can be so healing. So glad to read of the teachers showing this movie to their students.  It is so wonderful--the best ever!  I own one movie poster and it is for this movie.",1497916800,,1057,4.287878787878788

The first half moves slow, but is is foreshadowing a lot that happens in the second half. In fact, the first time I watched this, I almost turned it off half way. So glad I did not. The main character is so smart and witty. Sad setting (WW2), but it is a story of love overcoming evil and the power of positive attitude.

This DVD came with option for English dubbed over Italian. The languages must be close because it was not at all distracting. I did not want to read subtitles (another option on this dvd)",1487116800,8,622,4.316239316239316

1023358,5,6305426651,"My favorite. Just an all-around beautiful movie, especially the second half of the film. To this day, it's the only movie that's ever made me both laugh aloud and shed a few tears. If I could give this even more stars, I would.

The reviews that say this mocked the Holocaust or that it's offensive don't get it. It does anything but. It handles the horrors respectfully and very powerfully shows the true tragedy of the Nazi regime, while demonstrating that there is always hope to be found in the human spirit. Also powerful themes of  fatherly love, imagination, and strength of spirit.

The ONLY ""downside"" (and I put downside in quotation marks b/c I don't personally believe it is one, but others seem to) is that, unless you speak Italian, you'll need to read subtitles (or, I suppose, get the English language version, if that's your cup of tea). But it's totally worth it.",1480377600,,881,4.670967741935484

1023432,5,6305426651,My girlfriend recommended this movie to me to watch. While I didn't like it was all subtitles (As I didn't know the native language) I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It was comedic while being full of drama and sadness. This is about the concentration camps and follows one family and how they were able to live during this time.,1478476800,2,339,4.483870967741935
1023433,5,6305426651,"The topic of fascism has come up a few times in our house this fall. Having seen and loved this movie when it first came out, we thought it might make a kid-appropriate way to teach our pre-teen sons about the Holocaust. (Schindler's List is too violent, Shoah too long, and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas has too brutal an ending.) Our 7th grader has dyslexia and couldn't handle the subtitles. Our 6th grader, who reads well, loved it. He got super engaged in the early part with all the humor, even the verbal humor (the riddles!) as well as the slapstick (the scene in the school!!). It kept him hanging in there when things got sad. We cried together, and it sparked some interesting discussions. I wish they would make a dubbed version of this film; I'm sure there are other families who would like a way to initiate discussions about the Holocaust with middle schoolers and others for whom subtitles are a distraction. (And of course, this Academy Award-winning film is well worth watching for adults, too. It kind of reminded me of Little Big Man with contrast between the silly humor and the horror of the events being depicted.)",1478131200,11,1138,4.610837438423645
1023434,5,6305426651,"I can't think of a more first half/second half movie. My reason for saying so is thus: I show it in my International Film Studies course each trimester. I cry every time we watch it. It always feels a little like a bait and switch because the students watch the first half, think we're watching a comedy, the bell ring, and they all go home. The next day, the movie turns into a Holocaust drama, but the heart is still there. They are grabbed by the film (a rarity for these high schoolers) and we are all touched by the film. I am simply astounded by the power of the film. I think it does a lot to speak to the power of the human spirit. I cannot help but think of Viktor Frankl, Holocaust survivor, who profoundly said: ""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose ones own way."" This film embodies this ethos. Everything can be taken from Guido except his incredible attitude. I can barely think about this movie too long before getting a little weepy, I could not recommend this movie more if you have not yet seen it.",1478131200,,1128,4.3254716981132075

It is an excellent way to show the disgusting actions of the Nazis and others during this period. It also shows a great love story - the love between Guido and his wife and Guido and his son. I show the Italian version with English subtitles. I believe it is best when shown in this manner. The students love it. There is not a dry eye in the classroom after the final scenes.

1024343,5,6305426651,"I have watched a few movies about Holocaust, all of them are masterpieces but none have moved me as much as Life is Beautiful, this on par with Everything is Illuminated.  Amazing directorial and acting job by Robert Benigni and there are several interesting moments at play here which you might not have noticed from the first time, it took me 3 times to fully get the subtleties.
1. The movie shows two things that seem at first improbable to a reasonable human being.  The first, is beautiful, educated, aristocratic Dora falling in love with Guido.  The second of course, are the atrocities committed.  Both seem hard to believe, yet they happened, and continue to happen in the real world, the first shows the power of love, big heart and sense of humor, the second, the ever-present dark side of a human nature.
2. When Guido meets Dr. Lessing at camp, his hope is that the doctor remembering their prior friendship is his way out, and the look on his face when he realizes that the doctor is just another selfish bastard who only cares about stupid riddles and does not give a damn about him as a person is really the only look of dismay that Guido displays during the entire stay at camp because the rest of the Nazis for him are what they are but this one was thought to be a friend, and the betrayal is unbearable.
3. Guido's quick wit in seemingly impossible situations shows us a combination of intelligence, sense of humor and amazing love for his child and spouse.  I thought the most ingenious moment was when Joshua, the son was mistaken for a German child and taken to a nice dinner, where Guido was asked by Lessing to work as a waiter, a small glimpse of civility in his dreary days, and accidentally, Joshua says Grazie, the other waiter notices it, and runs to report, when he comes back, Guido has taught all the kids to say Grazie, thereby making the incident seem as if the stupid waiter is teaching kids Italian, not Joshua making what could have been a fatal mistake.
4. Dora could have stayed safely at home, but she chose to board that train, a very powerful moment.
5. And the final scene with the tank shows that Guido magically told the 100% truth to his son.",1459728000,,2190,4.492462311557789

1024831,5,6305426651,"If there is one thing truly impressive about this movie, it is that it adheres to a classical comedy. Who can take a theme such as the Holocaust and set it within a comedy? This film is genius.

The classical comedy focuses on a base man who is raised above his station so that he looks quite ridiculous. That is where the amusment and laughter comes from. Another focus is that violence is never directly shown in a classical comedy. It may be hinted at, or implied, but never directly shown. I must say that this film cemented ""why"" those two conditions make for a great comedy. By shifting the focus off of violence, it places the importance on the humans in the film itself, not on the actions alone. Anyone can fart and burp, but only a master could take the Holocaust and show humor and demonstrate a noble endeavor all at once.

This film is heartwarming and heartwrenching. The heavy dreariness of Nazi Germany's oppresive party is never lifted, but the viewer is raised above those terrible things by the charm of the base man who is stuck in a position far above any man's station: a father.

This is a film, not mere entertainment. It is worth your time if you know the difference between those two genres.",1454284800,17,1217,4.497737556561086

Also, I generally only try to show examples of awesome writing, and I feel this is a reaaaly well written. American movies are obsessed with plot advancement but this is a welcome change... its character development until the point where a horrible plot finds our characters,  and because we know what it took for them to get where they are, their impossible decisions make sense.

I watched it three times, twice in Italian and once in English. I first watched it in Italian - you have to read fast, so you sort of miss the beauty of the Italian setting. I then watched it in English to just ""watch"", but felt it lacked the character that Italian language gave it, so I then watched it again in Italian; since I knew the storyline already, on the 3rd viewing, I was able to absorb the true Italian feel and character of the movie. At first Roberto's goofy character struck me as a stalker type, but then as you realize he is setting up the storyline, he grows on you and you start to love the man for what's in his heart. His quick wit and expressive,smiling face won me over! The musical score also draws you in; I also purchased the CD. The bonus feature is a must-see, as it explains the very great risk he took by incorporating comedy with the Halocaust, something that was taboo; and yet he was able to pull it off and was even embraced by the Jewish people.

1026010,5,6305426651,"As a high school teacher, I have committed to showing every student this movie. There are always a few kids who don't ""get it"" or even care to get it, but, by in large, most of the kids laugh at the right times, exhibit anguish other times, and cry at the end. I thought that was what real movies are suppose to do--invoke emotions??
Overall, after having gone through a rigorous year of Advanced Placement history, I try to get the students to understand why it is we even study history. And, if they do not get what this movie is trying to accomplish, then we haven't done anything at all. Forget that the movie is low budget film which relies on few props and special effects, it's the humanity that's on display here: sacrifice, cleverness, humor, loyalty, and courage.
Those of us who have given high recommendations here fully understand there are movies about the Holocaust which represent another point of view of the horrific event that took place less than 100 years ago (I respect, honor, and watch those movies, too). Life is Beautiful is one of those films that witnesses to the soul--the human spirit. Also, you must watch it in the original, Italian version!",1431475200,4,1173,4.644230769230769

I note several complaints that this isn't a realistic or accurate Holocaust account.  I suppose under this rubric that 98% of all Westerns, biopics, war stories, and dystopics (at least those who've already made their dire predictions about what L.A. will be like in the 1990s), including Gone With the Wind and Dances with Wolves, should also be discredited.

But this movie was so goofy, and the main actor was so annoying. At times I thought the movie would turn into a musical where he would start singing and all the Nazis and Prisoners would start dancing. That's how ridiculous this movie is. In reality, he would have been shot dead for his ridiculous antics. The suffering in the movie didn't near depict what happened in reality. And if my own 6 year old son believed that this was all a game, he would have been one dumb kid. I only gave this movie two stars because I appreciate the sentiment of a dad who wants to protect his son.

He is a real gem.  If you have never watch a movie with him, youj HAVE TO watch this one.  You will thank yourself for doing so.

He gave it all to keep his son from knowing what a wretched situation he was truly in... and what's more remarkable, he prepared his son to survive.  Laugh, cry, think... really think.... could I keep up the act for my child?  Would I? Could I?  How many parents protected their children in their own unique, heroic ways?  We will never know.  But we will think - there is no doubt. My two favorite scenes were when he couldn't pick up his son without falling, yet he found the strength... and when he comforted his wife from a distance when she likely thought her son was dead.

1026854,4,6305426651,"I didn't know what to expect going into Life is Beautiful, but I don't think it ended up being what I was partially expecting. Roberto Benigni certainly tackles the Holocaust from a new angle, and one that very few people would take. A Chaplin-style comedy directly centered on a concentration camp is something very few people could pull off, but Benigni is one of the few.

Benigni admits that Chaplin is one of his biggest influences and that is shown thoroughly throughout Life is Beautiful. The choreographed happenstance comedy to the facial expressions and huge smiles are very reminiscent of Chaplin, but Benigni triumphs in making them his own rather than a mere imitation.

The very difficult part in making this sort of film is blending the world of comedy in such a harsh environment of sad truth. Its a much easier task to make a sad, but real film about the holocaust or even to make a solid comedy (which would probably be inappropriate and disrespectful). Combing the two worlds is very hard, but again, with little moments throughout the film, Benigni makes us realize the reality and horror, while making us laugh and love life along with him.

All in all, there is still a little bit of room for improvement. There are a few scenes that could have been better scripted, and a few details in other places, but in the end, Life is Beautiful is a moving film about life, love, and sacrifice that fully lives up to its title.",1420675200,3,1440,4.661417322834645

I was completely overcome with emotion and with the beauty of the relationship that is portrayed amongst the family in this film.

Over the past ten or twelve years I thought of the movie often, but the idea of re-watching it was almost intimidating.  The story creates moments of such joy and light, but at an enormous cost of feeling.  The second half of the film is absolutely heart wrenching.

1028030,5,6305426651,"I am grappling on how to present this masterpiece as because there are so many ways to approach ""Life is Beautiful.""

First, I could do it thematically. This is, for me, a story about love and hope, especially in relation to the desire to survive. Honestly, I can write a whole essay on this, but film and Holocaust scholars have probably already beaten me to the punch.

I could also talk about the use of foreshadowing. Yes, there is foreshadowing, and you might not even realize it until you start explaining this movie to other people. You might not pick up on all of them, even if you have watched this movie multiple times. The seamless and  subtle use of foreshadowing really adds to the total experience. Once you realize something, you can't help but have a ""Oh, my God"" moment. I still have those moments, even though I've watched this movie several times.

In addition to foreshadowing, there's just a wealth of detail put into the movie that just adds so much depth. For example, the Ethiopian cake at the engagement party. For me, that cake just serves to remind the audience of Italy's disastrous attempts to colonize Ethiopia in 1895 and again during World War II. And, I think, we are suppose to question where the haughtiness and sense of superiority the Fascists have when the film first takes place. There's also the references to silence--a major theme found in Holocaust literature and films (I'm thinking in particular of  Martin Niemller's poem ""First they came..."").

Then, there's the acting. Everybody, even the extras, have it down to a tee. Benigni, somehow, manages to express physical and mental weariness while putting on pretend enthusiasm. People tend to talk about how Guido protects Joshua at the camp but, in reality, he does that even before they are kidnapped and forced onto the train. I don't want to give away too much, but I would like to ask you to pay attention to the shop scene when Joshua wants to buy something for his mom, and Guido spots the ""No dogs or Jews allowed"" sign. Just look at his face and how he initially responds his son's request. The subtly in Benigni's acting in that scene is just amazing.

Now, some might be wondering, ""Why on earth use comedy in a Holocaust movie?"" First of all, this is about a larger-than-life, eccentric character who deals with problems and stress by making jokes. Guido not only does this for himself but also for his loved ones. He tries to alleviate their stress by making them laugh. Two, I think this is a wise decision on the part of Benigni to use comedy because it makes the tragic parts that much more tragic. Here, I would like to invite you once more to think about foreshadowing. The combined use of comedy and foreshadowing make this movie that much more poignant.

In my personal experience, I cry harder than the last time I watch this movie and I simply can't explain why. I know exactly what is going to happen and yet I'm moved so much more every time I watch ""Life is Beautiful."" Maybe it has something to do with the fact I can find something new every time I watch it. Or maybe it's because I re-fall in love with Guido, Dora, and Joshua and continue to hope against all knowledge that everything turns out alright. Who knows.",1398384000,,3238,4.609375

Philosophically, we have a good laugh about anti-Semitic Schopenhauer and the Germans in general are caricatured.

In regards to _The Book Thief_, the settings and characters make for good comparisons between the two, and my students appreciated the humor (as, apparently, most of school-taught literature is sad, tragic stuff).

Do you really feel the need to witness children being gassed, even for the sake of authenticity? This movie doesn't make light of the Holocaust, it highlights the absurdness haughtiness of the deluded nazis. It puts some humanity into a subject that usually leaves us numb to the idea of 'humanity' in general.

1028438,2,6305426651,"This ""sentimental slop"", hardly registering any intelligence, is considered a ""masterpiece"" and received numerous vapid awards, notably from powerful Jewish groups and pompous film festivals. It is both ineffective as a film and as a critique against clichd injustice. I can't believe how empty it was, it starts out in a comedic manner, but it is absent of any laughs. The direction throughout was haphazard and even tedious. The ""evil"" Germans were cardboard caricatures who were so clichd that they didn't even seem to exhibit any movement in the film. Its obvious this film was some attempt to portray the magical realism of early Italian films with a pressing new concern for so called ""ethics"" but is biased, immature and intangible.

It is another ""holocaust"" as collective conscience film that wants to hammer its obtuse point across. Be weary of such films as they want to present everything in simplistic 'black and white"" formulations.",1392163200,2,946,5.142857142857143

A lot of stories about WWII are overwhelming sad due to the content and the nature of the historical event. But this movie allows a person to understand the tragedy while also seeing just how beautiful and precious life is and how we should keep it that way for our children as long as possible.

I prefer to watch this movie in the Italian, but the English Dub uses the original actors voices in most situations, so it's watchable for sure in English too.",1382400000,,678,4.641666666666667

1028848,5,6305426651,"Good for a laugh, but as the movie progresses you can see that (in the plot line), all is not well.
I love this movie. I love how the main character ""re-frames"" the events of the holocaust into a game
for his son, to keep his son from being alarmed. I'm not saying one can do that with the holocaust, so I don't want any one to misread what I'm saying here.

 What ever we go through in life, it may be possible to experience some things differently, just by the ""take"" or the perspective we have on what is going on around us.
If someone says they hate you, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you. It's their loss.
If it's possible to ignore such a person, it's better to go about doing something else. I used to get upset
by these types of pronouncements from people(mostly the mean little kids on the playground) but
I think it can apply to our every day lives. There always some one some where who makes it their business to make every one they can miserable. They're not happy until they goad someone.

The tricks and the antics that Roberto portrays in this movie is hilarious, fun loving, and at times very
touching. Roberto is sweet, he is kind, his life portrays a life lived well. I'd love to be able to land on my feet the way he did!",1380499200,6,1258,4.190082644628099

Other than personal perceptions, it is a piece of art and legacy of a horrendous episode of humanity that should not be forgotten.
It is a big contrast of how ""peaceful"" was Italy and how it allowed the couple to meet, but as it happens in reality, things change and the Nazi changed the fate of Europe and this family.

At once hilarious and heartwarming, and haunting and disturbing, director and star Roberto Benigni creates not just one of the finest Holocaust films of all time, but one of the saddest, happiest, heartwarming, brilliant, and truly, truly beautiful movies ever made.

This is not your typical Hollywoodized cheesy melodramatic soap opera. No emotion feels saccharine or cheesy, no tear is not earned, and no joyous moment not truly thrilling. This is the touching story of a man who loved his child so much he would try to shield him from unspeakable characters if it meant his life. La Vita  Bella (Italian name) will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions; from gut-bursting laughing, to joy, to sorrow, to sickening horror, disbelief, and joy again.

If there is one thing that La Vita  Bella has to tell us, it is that Life, truly IS, beautiful. Light can triumph over darkness and there is hope even in despair. I urge you to watch this incredible film, which is both one of my favourites, and one of the greatest films ever made.

You'll probably laugh. And will likely also cry. But for me, it reached deeper than laughter and tear to touch the very core of humanity and love:
Being able to say ""Life is beautiful"" in any situation is in itself COURAGE. To not only see hope through destitute and cruelty but to put hope in the lives of others is in itself STRENGTH. To laugh in the face of death to protect a loved one is in itself LOVE. Superb acting, great comic reliefs and a stunning storyline brought new light into one of the most tragic chapters of history. This movie has it all. It penetrates one's mind as lightly as humor often comes yet it reaches deeply and lingers.

I was worried that I was interpreting a movie about the Holocaust incorrectly, but no, that was the intention of the film. Weird, right? Some people have found that disrespectful, but I thought the film was very well done. I must admit that I selected it randomly off the foreign language shelf in the library, wanting something new, and didn't even look at it that closely. I was therefore surprised at the abrupt change of pace in the middle of the movie. I enjoyed it a lot, though. I don't care that the beginning was silly. Why not have fun in life? The silliness in the second half was hard to get a grasp on, even knowing the father was doing it for the sake of his son. I think... if I was one of the men staying in the same shack as the two of them, I would have gotten fed up with that ""game"" pretty quickly. Well, probably immediately. Him shielding his son from the Nazis didn't strike me as unbelievable so much as a bunch of random prisoners not getting in the way of one man's game. I would think at least one of them would just have enough and explode one day.

So, is life beautiful? Not all that often. But, if a man going through the Holocaust can keep up a shred of hope, anyone can.",1373760000,,1352,4.24031007751938

It was hard for me to believe that this melancholy woman would fall for a man that acted so silly. When he is taken away, the man makes a game of the horrible circumstances for the benefit of their son.  It was inconceivable that anyone could maintain his demeanor under such grim conditions.  Even though they were in a concentration camp, the movie didn't dwell on the negative (altho that is the reality).  I rated this movie as okay as the underlying message was to see the ""silver lining"" in any situation -- which is a good theme in life for anyone.",1373328000,,721,4.431818181818182

1029381,2,6305426651,"Since the Italian film Life Is Beautiful deals with the Second World War and the Holocaust, many viewers watched for signs of insensitivity; really they were looking for any traces of irreverence towards subject matter which forces the filmmakers to tread carefully.  The very notion that this film could be a comedy offended some viewers.  My unease was of a different sort; the way that Italians portray their nation's involvement in the war.

It has become a widely accepted notion that Italians were victims of the NAZI's - presumably due to the Wehrmacht's slow fighting retreat up the peninsula during the last years of the war.  But is that a truthful notion?  After all. the Italians invented Fascism.  Mussolini came to power eleven years before Hitler, and was a role model for the latter.  NAZI Germany came to Italy's aid when they ineptly invaded Greece and Egypt.  When the Allies landed in Italy, the Italians switched sides and greeted them as liberators.  Given this appalling wartime record, can the Italians claim equal status with the French, Greeks, et cetera as innocent victims?  They can and do claim that mantle, but should not.  Vestiges of Fascism remain in Italy to this day.

I know the rejoinder: ""Come on, it's a comedy.""  But it is a pretentious comedy treading on important history.  Millions of people define themselves today in relation to that conflict, therefore the truth must be served.  It's not an easy task, but the obligation remains; it's therefore a queasy experience to sit through this.",1367280000,,1533,4.956862745098039

One of the ten best motion pictures of all time. It is number 4 on my list. It has many delightful, humorous moments. The love between a father and a son portrayed in the film is equal to the love between a father and son as seen in the motion picture ""The Champ."" Although it is fiction, the film vividly portrays the horror and tragedy of the Holocaust and the ultimate victory of good over the most monumental evil in history. You will laugh. You will cry, You will be almost overcome by man's inhumanity to man, but you will become a better and more grateful person from seeing the film. When we witness human tragedies in art, there is a spiritual renewal (catharsis) and our souls are purified. Then we can truly say, LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, and add the words of Ann Frank, ""I think not of all the evil but of the beauty that remains.""

1029518,5,6305426651,"Having watched the big Steven Spielberg Hollywood blockbuster about the holocaust, Schindler's List, I was much more moved by Benigni's attempt to show the courage and pain of the Jewish victims in his film, Life is Beautiful. The plot follows the Jewish character,Guido Orifici, as he attempts to woo his 'principessa', the beautiful Dora. She leaves her Aryan fascist fiance for the amusing and loveable Guido, but just as they start to enjoy their life together, Italy becomes suffocated by the influence of Nazi power. Eventually Guido, along with their son, is captured and sent to Auschwitz. Despite her wealthy and influential background, Dora refuses to be left behind and demands a place on the death train beside them. When they reach Auschwitz, Guido desperately attempts to keep his son from being afraid by pretending that they are participating in a game to win a tank, rather than being held against their will.

The references to the mass murder of the Jewish nation are all the more powerful through their subtlety: we are shown vans full of women driving off not to return, a group of old people and children undressing for the showers which cuts to the piles of empty clothes, and finally a smokey obscured image of the horrific pile up of corpses in the camp. The film is both beautiful and brutal and you will find yourself simultaneously laughing out loud and crying, captivated by Guido's touching attempts to keep his son safe and alive. It is a beautiful celebration of a father's love for his son and of the sacrifices and bravery that went on in order to liberate the surviving members of Auschwitz from the death camps.",1359244800,,1647,4.840425531914893

Well, if you think the trailer is kind of silly, then there is a lot more where that came from...the entire movie is like that. Silly, happy-go-lucky, always smiles, always laughter, impossible ""happy"" circumstances, silly talk, and more happy happy.

Oh yes, it's 1939 and World War II is underway. But never mind that...just more happy happy. It even shows Jewish people taken by train to a camp...shows them wearing black/white striped clothing...but even then...more happy happy.

After 15 minutes, I increased the speed of my DVD player to hurry-up the movie (still able to listen to the audio). After 30 minutes, I started to fast forward into the movie to see if it would get serious at all. Nope. At 1 hour into the movie (at the happy happy Jewish camp scene), I decided to turn it off.

Maybe this movie is your cup of tea, but it is not for me. I did not find it cute, happy, or entertaining. It's just silliness. Given the era and what was occurring in history at that time, I thought the movie was insulting. I would not classify this movie as a war/military drama (although some websites do).

Prior to renting (or buying it), I encourage you to watch the trailers. On youtube, search for: ""Life is Beautiful"" trailer. And you can probably find trailers elsewhere on the internet too.

The default spoken language is Italian with English subtitles, but you can change the DVD settings to spoken English.

1029719,2,6305426651,"...but imagination is not life.

Please skip this review if you have not seen the movie yet.

I found this movie well-made and entertaining but also contrived and unconvincing. There is also something disturbing which is probably caused by a supposed disproportionate impact of Benigni's ego on the movie. And this does not seem to concern an aspiring (or even failing) artistic ego, I would say, but rather an exhibitionistic ego.
This movie is imagination-driven and creatively and culturally interesting, but it is not uplifting.

Maybe the core of my criticism of this movie is that the playful and daring and unlikely attitude Guido has towards his son (in the second part of the movie) in those existentially pressing circumstances, is that this attitude can only be approved or justified, I believe, if it works, that is: when it has the intended effect of appeasing the mind and heart of the son. In the movie it does have this effect and so the attitude could be approved (in the context of the movie). Yet, this attitude works precisely because the movie is a product of (Benigni's) imagination, it (only) works in a contrived imaginary world.
So Benigni provided a context for an unlikely attitude to work. But to what avail?

Also the portrayed or suggested braveness of Guido in the camp is unconvincing and hollow; this braveness could be sustained only because the reality in which Guido lives has been bended by Benigni into an unlikely artificial reality.

I do think though, this movie does evoke an interesting question:
Can the creation of subrealities for somebody else (and presenting it as real) be really helpful for that other?

Admitting that this movie is creative and energetic, I ask:
What does Benigni's creativity and imagination in this movie (intend to) serve apart from being merely entertaining?",1352073600,,1830,4.983606557377049

This is one of the few movies which have stuck with me throughout the years. Now that I have three kids of my own, its story pops up quite often in my head. My 5 year old son sees every single event and non event in life as a game. You can't pick up a napkin without him picturing it turning into a sail on a ship or a cape on a super hero. As I watch his playful spirit, I often think about this man and his son. What would I have done? For a young boy, the world of games and the imagination is a comfortable and familiar place. Using the only weapon this man had at his disposal when everything else was stripped away, he was able to shield his son from the horrors that surrounded him. To be able mask the dread and complete fear that must have been going on in the father's mind is a testament to the strength that it must have taken. In a situation which could easily strip all hope, the love he had for his son didn't let him succumb, forcing him to find the good that hid in the crevices and shadows of humanity. This movie is so unique. In no other movie is there coexisting a comedy and tragedy side by side. While you are laughing at the situation, you can't help but cry at the same time. I think of it often when life gets me down. To give in the the darkness even when it is hard to see anything else is a choice...always. This movie shows that there is always light, there is always hope, and there is always love even when the inevitable is not of our choosing, you just have to look and never ever close your eyes or your heart.",1345593600,3,1674,4.014970059880239

I saw the movie for the first time when it was shown oi the theater and I liked it very much. I took the opportunity to buy when there was a Blu Ray DVD sale at the end of the year.
I was glad I got the DVD as I forgotten part of the story; I remembered very well the second part when the main characters were taken to the concentration camp and how the father tried to show his small son that they were participating in a game to hide all the horrors of the concentration camp.
When I saw the movie again I realized why I liked it so much when I saw it the first time; it is a beautiful story, how the main characters met, getting involved and quickly falling in love marrying and having a child. The second part of the story starts with the persecution of Jews at the beginning of the Second World War, and Guido played by Roberto Benigni and son were arrested and sent to a concentration camp, his wife chose to go with them than stayed safe in the city. Husband and wife were always separated, but he always tried to get her attention, as example he played ""La barcarola"" from Tale of Hoffmann in the concentration camp while working in a room where Nazi officials got together.

1029763,5,6305426651,"Intro
This movie needs no introduction - the beautiful tale that is ""Life is Beautiful"" quickly puts it at the top of many people's top movies of all time lists. This is the fourth blu-ray that I purchased when I built my new HTPC, and I have quickly amassed a large collection, seeking after the best of the best!

Image Quality
Let's get down to what you want to know. The image quality on the blu-ray is about an 8/10. Certain scenes are a little soft in their focus, but I was pleased to see that they didn't do too much de-noising on the transfer. I own this movie on DVD, and there is a clear difference in quality. The colors are better, and the overall sharpness is not overly-digital as you might find on some blu-rays!

Sound Quality
Again, the sound quality is quite good, and again much better than DVD. I'm not an audiophile, but with a modest home theatre set up I was very pleased and the audio!

Overall
Even if you don't care about blu-ray quality, this movie is a must have. A surprisingly clean transfer however, makes this a movie worth future-proofing!",1330992000,4,1073,4.436548223350254
1029764,5,6305426651,Great movie. Used it in my classroom after my students visited the Jewish Heritage Museum and learned about the Holocaust.,1330905600,,122,5.15
1029765,5,6305426651,"First, I want to say that when I first saw this movie, I saw it in a movie theater with 6 people: myself, my mother, and 4 concentration camp survivors.  There was not a dry eye in the house as the credits rolled.  One of the Auschwitz survivors said to me on the way out, ""it was this kind of love and devotion that saw me through.""

Second, I find it interesting that the haters for La Via e Bella pin it against Schindler's List.  I have never met a person who loves Life is Beautiful ever say a bad thing about Schindler's List.  They are two different films, with two different purposes.  Schindler's List exposes the cold, dark reality of 1940s Europe and teaches about the Holocaust on a mass scale.  However, if we look at history, we can see that people often can't see the forest for the trees.  In Rwanda, it's hard to hear that millions died, but it's even more touching to see Hotel Rwanda and what one man did for one group of people.  The same is the case here.  Life is Beautiful is not about the 6 million Jews who died; it is a fable about ONE family's struggle to survive.  The impact is that rather than just another faceless person dying, you see Guido, a man that the viewer has developed an extreme closeness and affection for, face the end.  In that way, Life is Beautiful is actually far more analogous to The Pianist.

Third, anyone who writes a review stating that they only watched the first half of the movie has no idea what they're talking about.  THIS IS NOT A COMEDY ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST.  That is an insult.  The first half is jovial and light because it is about the family BEFORE the dark cloud of the Holocaust took over their lives.

Fourth, the comedy that appears in the second half is there for one purpose: survival.  Guido loves his son so much that he is willing to do anything to protect him.  Anything.  That is not comedy.  That is not insulting.  That is love.

The last and stupidest comment I've seen on here is someone claiming that the title is insulting because life wasn't beautiful in the Holocaust.  I don't even know how to respond to such an ignorant interpretation.  Look up at point four; what the title refers to is the beauty of a father's UNCONDITIONAL love for his son.

If Steven Spielberg didn't like this movie (as some indicate), that is his mistake.  Schindler's List is a masterpiece, but so is Life is Beautiful.  I suggest anyone to see it, embrace it, and discuss it with your friends.

I like the idea that Benigni tries to protect his childs innocence by convincing him that the concentration camp their in is some kind of psychotic summer camp.  And when the convention works its very powerful. But when it gets hard to believe (as when the Nazis fail to discover the boy over a long period of time) it takes a lot of the power out of its punch.

1029906,4,6305426651,"""Life Is Beautiful"" is a film that is daring in its attempt to create laughs in the realistic setting of the Holocaust, yet filled with considerable visual comedy  The movie opens in Italy in 1939. Guido (Roberto Benigni) is a carefree drifter with a modest dream of going to the city to open a bookstore.  Guido falls in love with Dora (Ncoletta Braschi, Benigni's wife), who is engaged to a humorless Fascist thug.  Guido wins her heart by sheer persistence and his tireless sense of humor.

Guido and Dora marry and have a son, Giosue, but by now Italy has been overtaken by the Nazis, who soon begin rounding up all Italian Jews, including father and son.  Dora insists on going with her family on the train to the work camp.

To protect his son from the real horrors of the camp, Guido tries to transform their plight by turning unpleasantries into games, always trying to shield the boy from what really takes place.

Benigni won an Academy Award for this film, which stirred controversy because of the conceit of turning the Holocaust -- even in fictional terms -- into a lighthearted comedy, which had never been done before.  The fact that we get to know Guido as a happy-go-lucky clown allows the second half of the movie to work.  Like Chaplin, Benigni has the ability to create big laughs through slapstick and sight gags in one scene, while eliciting pathos in another.  The balance works, as the viewer gets an escalating sense of the inevitable as Guido's games are harder to pass off as frivolity.  In addition to starring, Benigni co-wrote the screenplay and directed.

Blu-ray bonus extra include a making-of featurette, Academy Awards TV commercials, and theatrical trailer.",1316822400,4,1693,4.8

1029956,5,6305426651,"Comedy and Tragedy are locked in a unique struggle around the main characters of this story set in WWII Italy.  Guido is a mad-cap Jewish waiter, a self-designated ""Principe."" Dora is the adored sweetheart that Guido calls ""Principesse.""  Joshua is the son that they have together, a darling kid who looks just like his father.

The action of the story begins when, due to faulty brakes in a friend's convertible, Guido is driven at breakneck speed down the main street of a country town where he is mistaken for the King, whose arrival the townspeople are awaiting.  The people hail Guido as he races by, and he waves back at them, assuming the character of the King.

The love story begins when Dora falls out of the sky and lands on top of Guido.  The two raise themselves up from a pile of hay and look at one another with pleased wonder and surprise, falling immediately in love.  Guido insists upon sucking a wasp's stinger out of Dora's thigh!

Notice that Dora is wearing a big, pretty summer hat with a small black veil when she falls from Heaven into Guido's arms.  Notice that there are lots of hats in this movie.  A lot of hat-play goes on.  What meaning, if any, are we to deduce from the hat motifs?

Back in the city, on the streets, other encounters between Guido and Principesse occur.  One is a freak accident in which Guido lands on top of Principesse and the two are splayed on the ground while school children laugh merrily at the sight!

Later, the couple are thrown together again by circumstances and, as they walk about the city streets together, Guido is trying to get Principesse to say Yes to him and she says she doesn't know what the key to making her say Yes is.  She says that her father used to know very well how to get her to say Yes. Guido gets the bright idea to look up to Heaven and ask Mary for the key to make Dora say Yes.  Immediately, a key falls down from Heaven!  Each time that the couple prays to Mary, they get an immediate answer to their prayer.

Guido and Dora long for one another, but Dora is engaged to marry someone else.  Her engagement party takes place at a restaurant where Guido is a waiter.  Alarmed to learn that Dora is engaged to another guy, he sends her a great big cake that says, ""Bon jour, Principesse,"" which is the greeting he uses often to please her and to recommend himself to her.  When Guido has to get down on the floor under the table to clean up something, Dora crawls under the table, too.  Tete-a-tete, she requests, ""Take me away.""  Guido hastens to comply with her wish.

Next scene, Guido calmly and proudly enters the banquet hall seated upon a white horse that had been standing outside the hall and that belongs to a family member of his.  The horse is painted over with a lurid green color.  Vandals have written upon the horse, ""Achtung, Jewish Horse!"" and they've drawn a skull and crossbones on it.  Dora climbs up onto the horse with Guido and they ride out of the hall.  The horse is an emblem of the Jewish persecution that has begun in the city and that about six years later will send the married couple and their little boy, Joshua, to a Nazi prison camp.

In prison, using his clever mad-cap ingenuity, Guido is able to hide his son in his bunk with him and to keep the boy distracted from the truth about the horror around them by making up a game about a contest for winning a tank, which is something Joshua wants keenly.

The ending of the story when Guido is killed is heartbreaking and unbearably sad, but then, the sorrow is immediately uplifted.  The action of the film does not stop to dwell on death, but moves on, on a rather light note.  Joshua is now happy in his powerful, big tank that the liberating American soldier allows him to drive.  It's a bigger tank than he probably ever dreamed of winning.  He and his mother are together again and have one another.

Guido, the clever fool, has saved his loved ones, especially his son, and Life will go on for them in a mildly Beautiful way, but it will not be even nearly so Beautiful for them as it was when Guido was leaping onto bikes and racing about and serving his son and his Principesse.

I could understand all the slapstick involving hats was in the movie because Guido was a mad-cap character.  Guido's little family all wear hats, which seems fitting.  I couldn't understand all the slapstick involving eggs.  Was it just incidental?

A nice thing about the film was, I thought, that we get to see the Yanks who liberate the camp in the role of strong, beneficent rescuers, as they used to be portrayed in the good ol' idealistic days following WWII.

On first viewing, it's difficult to comprehend what's going on in the action of the movie.  It seems like jumbled nonsense because your attention is divided between trying to read the subtitles and watch the movie.

Now, realistically, Guido's antics wouldnt work. However, if you're willing to suspend disbelief, then you're in for a touching story about the lengths a father will go to protect his son.  Because his son isn't gullible  he challenges his father repeatedly  theres added suspense whether Guido can pull this off.

The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the movie starts slow.  I kept wondering where it was going.  Once the family enters the concentration camp, though, the real point of the story begins.  And the ending stayed with me for days afterwards.",1296777600,4,836,4.783216783216783

On Joshua's birthday, they are taken to a concentration camp. Dora looking for her family, finds them at a railroad crossing and demands to get on board, After much pestering, they let her on board and this is how she gets to the concentration camp. Begnini develops a game for he and Joshua to compete in. He says they are to win a tank if they win against all the others in the concentration camp. He manages to keep Joshua alive despite all the children in the camp being killed. This is a lovely heartbreaking story of love and courage.

I believe I accidently happened upon this picture while wandering aimlessly around the foreign film section of Blockbuster video on a winter evening back in 1998 (when the film was first released).  At the time, the title probably resonated somewhere inside the idealistic part of my psyche...but here I am years later, still affected. Roberto Begnini somehow manages to artfully convey (even as the tone, events and storyline within the movie dramatically change) that we have the ability to mold uncertain (at times fearful) circumstances into bearable opportunities to cope, and ultimately live (there is an irony, here, for any who see the very end of the film). The focus is indirectly placed on the choices we make and attitudes/perspective we have as we go through hardship; simple awareness and determination; and, of course, real love.  The love conveyed here is the sacrifical kind that wants the best for the other person...but touches also on the qualities in love (and in life) that are absolutely fantastical and magical: the things that don't need explaining and the stuff that is known by methods other than the tangible:  happenings, circumstances, people and events that transport us to the places that make sense only in the context of an intimate relationship with a universe of intricacy and uncertainty.

1030064,3,6305426651,"This highly acclaimed film is not without controversy.  The highly successful Italian comedian Roberto Benigni has created a film that uses all the time tested techniques of comedy and brings them to one of the most horrific chapters in human history, the systematic deaths of millions of Jewish people by the Germans in World War II. He is a master of slapstick which he combines with romantic comedy in the first half of the film. Every silly strategy from cars without breaks to raw eggs in hats is used. The first half of the film, except for a few references to fascism, is as light as a Rock Hudson and Doris Day romantic comedy with Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi playing his romantic interest. Benigni is the lovable clown character, the wise-fool, which is a standard in Western literature and films. In addition, Benigni uses a child actor, Giorgio Cantinini who is superb and is possibly the most appealing child actor since Shirley Temple in the 1930s. Thus there is a group of viewers who are thrilled and moved by the theme that a loving and inventive father could use his humor, intelligence, imagination, and love for his small son to hide and save that son in a concentration camp. This is understandable since we all want to believe that the human spirit can overcome all adversity and horror; that we can use our gifts to counter terror; that we can save innocence in the human condition through humor and creativity.

However, there are also groups of viewers who found the film highly offensive and their criticism bears analysis and thought. The film has absolutely no historic accuracy and the German's created a systematic killing machine that was structured so that no one could save themselves, no matter how creative or funny they may be. In summary of these critics, they point out that Benigni does to the viewing audience exactly what the character Guido is doing for his little son, shielding the viewer from the real horror and terror of the holocaust.

A defense of the film might be that the film attempts to show mankind at its best and mankind at its worst. However, the depiction of mankind at its worst was never remotely portrayed in this film. This may leave many viewers with a sense of dishonesty. If someone made a comedy film about the horror of 9/11, our entire nation would be offended. Keep this in mind when you hear that many found this film to be painful and dishonest.",1263081600,4,2421,4.718676122931442

1030128,5,6305426651,"Life Is Beautiful is an extraordinarily significant work of art. Screenwriter/Director/Actor Roberto Benigni takes Tragicomedy to new heights, even as he pays tribute to the finest work of Charles Chaplin. Benigni plays Guido, an Italian Jew whose ethnicity is suddenly and shockingly targeted by the Nazis at a time when he is growing a young family- after having, literally, fallen upon the ""Princesa,"" the woman of his dreams- as well as a fine bookstore.

 A genuinely happy, warm and charming person, Guido, along with millions of other Jewish people, is now beset by woes of almost horrificaly unimaginable proportions as he and his little boy are taken away by the Nazis to a concentration camp. His intent, no matter what may follow and above all else except keeping his child physically alive in Auschwitz, a place and time where Jewish children were systematically gassed and killed, is to protect the innocence of his young son by pretending the whole horror is a game, the end of which, if he plays right, is to win a tank.

 Guido's wife, who is not Jewish and not sent on the train, insists on accompanying the rest of her family, husband and son, to Auschwitz, much to the surprise of the Nazi soldier at the train station; her life is her loved ones, something he does not understand.

The strikingly beautiful cinematography- including exceptionally rich use of color, choice of camera shots and movement, set- and costume design-, editing, stirring musical score and fine surrealistic touch reminiscent of Fellini, make this film enjoyable and poetic in a visual sense, because there is rhyme and reason to each decision made by Benigni as screenwriter and director, as they blend with the dialogue, acting, story and theme to create a finely crafted, richly inspired, tragicomic masterpiece that brings forth tears of abject sadness amid the light of Guido's sense of play and fatherly protection- ""You always did want to go on a trip,"" he softly tells his little boy as they are carted off in the death train amid the foreboding musical passage that accompanies this shot.

 This seems bizarre but it is only the beginning of this man's overwhelming desire to shield his beloved child from the pain of the reality that confonts their family. In fact this preparation was actually, in a sense, begun before that, when Josue playfully hid from his mother in a little cabinet to avoid taking his bath, with his father in collusion with the game, something that winds up saving him from the fake ""bath"" at the camp.

 The use of extreme close-ups is reserved by director-screenwriter Benigni for the most poignant point in the film, where a final wink from Guido to little Josue hiding in the cabinet places the seal on the reality of their game of survival and preservation of the child's innocence.

 Survival in the physical sense and also in the emotional or psychological sense is Guido's role as father/protector of his child. Other high cinematic/editing feats include those such as the skillful, unobstrusive change of time from the courting of his wife stage to the realization of their family they created, five years later,in one single shot. This makes clear the family/child they created is a direct result of the love they have for each other. Cinematic poetry is unfortunately a rare phenomenon on the big screen, so this one is a true gem. It should be watched in the original Italian, because the true voices of the characters that people this film belong to them and should be heard by all.",1248220800,2,3524,4.8762541806020065

1030132,5,6305426651,"In ""Life is Beautiful"" Roberto Benigni has made a warm and romantic film filled with the joy of living. There are happy and magical moments scattered throughout this Italian masterpiece, but it is Benigni's handling of the holocaust that gives this film substance. You often hear this foreign film described as powerful and moving but upon viewing it for the first time you may wonder what all the fuss is about, until you reach the end and finally feel the impact of what Benigni has been trying to say.

The film opens in Arezzo, Italy, in 1939, Benigni and his pal just a couple of happy-go-lucky Italian guys looking to make a place for themselves. Benigni wants to open a book store but will end up waiting tables instead while he charms his princess in spite of her imminent engagement. Benigni's lovely wife Nicoletta Braschi plays the girl of his dreams and falls for him because he makes her laugh. Their romance is tender and funny, with a touch of the sweet flavor of an Italian bread.

A few years down the road, now with a book store and a young son, their lives begin to be intruded upon as anti-Semitism reaches its zenith. When his princess arrives home one day, she finds them missing, taken by soldiers. Hunting them down she forces a soldier to allow her to share in their fate, whatever that may be, and boards the train for the camps as well.

Benigni makes the conscious decision to shield his son from the evil around him and save his innocence, convincing him it is all a game, the grand prize a real tank; something his son can not resist. Separated from his wife in the camp he finds clever ways to let her know he loves her, resulting in some truly touching scenes.

But the real question is whether Benigni can keep up this high wire balancing act long enough to save his son's life and his innocence. The fact that Benigni keeps off screen the horror of the Holocaust makes the ending more powerful, as we have seen everything through the eyes of his son, yet we know the truth his son does not. The final shot is joyous yet poignant, leaving us suddenly angry, moved by what we have seen in unexpected ways.

This film is shown quite often in schools, and Disney has released this special edition for that purpose, with elements which will add to the discussion about this most important part of history, at an affordable price for teachers and schools. The power of this film is derived from the joy of living Benigni instills in it. This is a magnificent film probably not appreciated as much as it should be but a film that stands as a moving testament to all those who did not get to continue the joy of living.

1030172,1,6305426651,"Technically speaking, this movie share the same weaknesses of all the other Benigni's production: it's essentially a group of short gags assembled together more or less casually just to reach the proper length of a film.
As far as the content is concerned, most of the positive reviews run something like:
OK, don't seek historical accuracy in this film. This film is not about the holocaust primarily, it's purpose is not to document the holocaust. It is a film about family and the love of a father for his son. It is a film about how to survive in the most horrible conditions imaginable.
It seems to me they fail to grasp that this movie contains his own paradox. Out of a thousand way one can choose to stage ""the love of a father for his son"" Benigni picked up, not surprisingly, the holocaust, because he knew it was ""the most horrible conditions imaginable"", i.e. it's sooo touching and also the easiest way to get the audience on your side. On the other hand Benigni depicts a sort of watered, hilarious, Hogan heroes type of holocaust that is far from being ""the most horrible conditions imaginable"". Why? First because he is inherently a clown and that is the only way he knows to describe the facts of life, second because it would have been impossible to give the smallest bit of credibility to such a character amidst the horror of a real camp situation.
As a result, the film ends up giving no historical accuracy (actually is an insult to historical accuracy), and, much worse, sounding so fake also on the main characters side.
He simply was ready to take advantage of a real historical drama just as a background in order to give weight and gain support to a otherwise very inconsistent plot, script and mediocre acting.",1229904000,14,1738,4.646103896103896

1030175,5,6305426651,"I thought this was a touching and wonderfully creative film. Part comedy, part tragedy, ""Life Is Beautiful"" is a fictional tale that tackles an incredibly difficult subject, but does so primarily through omission.

Some reviewers criticize this movie as little more than ""garbage"" or even as ""obscene"" because it does not depict the raw horrors of the Holocaust. While I disagree with the negative assessments, this much is true: When you watch this film, you will not see the stark, brutal hell endured by the victims of Nazi evil - but that is precisely the point of this particular story. The horrors are left out by design.

""Life Is Beautiful"" relates the story of Guido and his family through the eyes of his innocent young son, Joshua. It is assumed that we - the viewers - are already aware of what happened in that place and time. We know what the Nazis were doing; we know about the atrocities they committed and the plans they had for the Jewish people. But the point of the film is that Joshua never does!

In the movie, Guido protects his son by disguising - and yes, as an earlier reviewer wrote, he ""sugar coats"" - the terrible things they encounter while in Nazi hands. Through Guido's efforts, deportation becomes a ""trip"" for young Joshua, and internment in the camp becomes a ""game"". None of these things is ever a game for Guido or the other adults in the film, but they are always seen that way by the child.

It is precisely the lack of horror in Joshua's experience that allows him to cope and, ultimately, to survive with his innocence in tact - an outcome made possible only through the terrific ingenuity of his loving and fiercely protective father. The closing lines of the film, spoken by Joshua, sum it up very nicely: ""This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This was his gift to me.""

""Life Is Beautiful"" is a fictional tale with a Holocaust theme, but it is not all-encompassing. It does not seek to detail every horror of the Holocaust; it is not a historical survey of the event and does not pretend to be an educational resource. Not every Holocaust story can relate every aspect or every detail of what happened, but - like this one - not all are intended to.

I recommend this film to everyone, but urge that viewers take it for what it is: one unique story from one unique perspective.",1224633600,2,2340,4.546318289786223

1030202,5,6305426651,"How to show the horrors of the Holocaust?  Spielberg created scenes of almost documentary quality on black and white film in Schindler's List because he believed color would make it too terrible to watch.  Roberto Benigni chose to make his Holocaust film in gaudy quasi-Technicolor with unnaturally rosy cheeks, bright pink dresses, and bright green horses.  Its main character is a live-action cartoon, complete with slapstick humor, running sight gags, and broad yet deep romance.  The result?  Life Is Beautiful is more than gut-wrenching.  The humor doesn't ease the horror of the Holocaust or make a joke out of it.  Contrary to what some reviewers here say, the humor makes the reality of the Holocaust all the more grim in contrast.

While Spielberg certainly captured the facts (and one wonders if one way in which Benigni could be faulted is that he has made a Holocaust movie with no violence), Benigni's film has a different kind of very real emotional truth.  Life is Beautiful is a must see, recommended for everyone.  At the same time I don't think I could ever own it.  One to watch every ten years, if that, because it's so hard to watch.  Life is Beautiful is a singular movie--horrifying, sickening, but somehow you still remember the jokes after it.

From here on, there will be some spoilers:

It is not the basic plot which makes this movie good, but the way in which the story is told.  All of the advertisements and many of the reviews focus on Benigni's character.  (He did after all win several Best Actor awards around the world.)  During the film he does seem to monopolize the attentions of the audience and the onscreen characters around him.  But the mastery is evident in that much of the story Benigni is telling is actually told very subtly.  We can see the love Guido has for Joshua through the father's tireless antics despite his complete exhaustion after a day of hard labor.  But Dora's love for her husband and son is even greater than theirs for her.  She demands that she be put on the train with her family, even though she is not a Jew. And although Guido tries to involve other prisoners in his game with his son, their attempts are half-hearted at best.  He certainly hasn't eased their condition.  What's more, he knows that he wouldn't be joking if it weren't for his son.

  Later, Guido's uncle instinctively helps a female German guard when she trips near him.  She is stunned and the audience should be as well.  On the opposite end of the spectrum of human kindness, Doctor Lessing seems to promise help for Guido and his family in the camp, only to ask Guido another riddle when they are able to meet in private.  It is the smallest actions which move this story forward, and which evidence just how well-told this story is.",1215043200,,2777,4.668041237113402
1030203,5,6305426651,"When this movie first came out, we went to the theatre to see it during a foreign film exhibition, and now, in an attempt to share it with the family and some friends, we acquired the DVD and saw it again, this time in the privacy of our home environment.

Life is beautiful is about love, romance, comedy, tragedy, horror, and it surfaces the best and worse of human emotions in a way that leaves us with the hope that someday we shall learn to live better lives.

Roberto Benigni starts as Guido, a young man who moves from the country to the city to work as a waiter for his uncle at a restaurant owned by the family. Guido is articulate, fun, possesses a great imagination and upon arrival falls in love with the woman of his dreams, who ""falls from the sky into his arms."" Dora, played by Benigni's real life wife, actress Nicoletta Braschi, is dating and is soon to be married to a man that Guido runs into and with whom Guido has several controversial episodes which serve to add great adventure and fun to the story.

Thanks to several encounters where Guido and Dora end up in each other's arms, Guido conquers Dora's heart and they marry, forming a beautiful family. We meet their son, played by Giorgio Cantarini... and the child is simply magnificent as the stubborn, intelligent and precocious boy that struggles to live through the Holocaust.

At some point, this ideal family life is shattered by the Nazis who arrest and ship the men off to a concentration camp. Because she is Italian, Dora is not arrested but she goes to the train station and commands the Gestapo in charge to stop the train because there has been a mistake. He reviews the list and tells her that no mistake has been made, she is not Jewish and therefore, has not been selected to go, but she explains that her husband and son are on the train, therefore, she too... must go on their journey. The saga that ensues is simply heart wrenching because Guido attempts to do something that we know is impossible, make believe that the concentration camp experience is part of a game designed to determine a winner of a real tank. He does this to shield the child from the horror of what they have to endure each and every day.

What we enjoy most about owning DVD's is that we get to see the special features and bonus material provided with the films. In this DVD, the extras include interviews with many actors that had the honor of working with Benigni, who comment on his personality and charismatic human power. The interviews answer the question: would a Jew be offended by attempting to bring humor, fun, and hope into circumstances surrounding the Holocaust? They conclude that the film surfaces the horror of it all and yet, provides an endearing vision into the best of humanity; a father that risks it all to make sure his child is not traumatized by the insanity created by the most evil machine ever conceived.

1030207,5,6305426651,"I can't allow myself to call this film a comedy.

Certainly Benigni brilliantly contrasts his warm Italian personality to the cold and ruthless Nazis. A humorous contrast, but I found it to be nothing to laugh at.

As a father, I almost couldn't bring myself to watch this film--I can't bear the thought of a child in such peril, but, I'm now glad I did.

 I felt the constant tension that Benigni's character, Guido must have felt as he perpetuated his lighthearted rouse for his innocent young son. At any given time, his son could have been discovered. He cleverly extends himself through his own heartbreaking fear to shield his son and send comfort to his wife incarcerated in another part of the camp.

The contrast continues as his son relays stories of children disappearing and people being made into soap and burned in furnaces and Guido responds with a laughing dismissal.  I felt relief as his son disobeyed his father when Guido told him to stop resisting and go take a shower with the other children.  Only from our perspective of history can we know what would have been in store for the child.

Life is Beautiful is a magnificent story.  Although, it does not delve deeply into the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust, it doesn't need to. It brings home the fact that humans are capable of terrifying coldness without the graphic horrors.  It serves well as a reminder of the Holocaust.

Benigni is as human and beautiful as the Nazis are animalistic and ugly.

1030209,5,6305426651,"This is one of the truest love stories ever written. It is not about the holocaust. The holocaust, as an event exemplifies everything ugly and hateful that we should fear in ourselves; the capacity of all of us to be led and to follow in fear, no matter what we believe. The holocaust should never, ever be forgotten.  It should stand as eternal proof of what we can all become, by simply not paying attention.

This film used the holocaust as a backdrop for surviving, but it is about more than surviving. It is about living, loving and sacrificing. It is about the love of a simple man for a woman, a woman for a man, and their love for their son. It is about the love they share and the values that sustain them through what must have been one of the most horrific experiences life can offer. Whether or not it's realistic that a man can make jokes through such internment, or make a game of it for his son, it is the beauty of people, of love, and of life that we can focus our gaze beyond the ugliness, shelter our own hopeful innocence, and show one another the beauty of ourselves, and of the world we share.

For those who wish to compare it to Schindlers List, it is not Schindler's List. It is far better. Shindler's list is about an ordinary man who comes through a moment in time and becomes a hero.

1030237,5,6305426651,"""Life is Beautiful"" is without doubt a wonderful film. At once we are reminded of the extremes of life - love and hatred, kindness and cruelty, laughter and sadness. Yet, through it all, ""Life is Beautiful"" for its optimism, courage and inner strength amidst adversity. Lessons that we as parents, as spouses and, above all else, as human beings should emulate.

The film moves quickly thanks to Roberto Benigni's brilliant story, tightly woven script and slapstick humour. Indeed, at times I thought I was watching Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or Harpo Marx in some scenes, i.e. the changing of hats, the horse in the restaurant, the umbrella dance, the runaway car, the exaggerated goosestep.

As for the Miramax `Collector's Edition' DVD, it features various film trailers, an interview with Benigni nd his wife (Nicoletta Braschi) and an interactive menu with language options in Italian or English. I watched it in Italian with English subtitles, and although I don't speak the language, I found it relatively easy to follow.

""Life is Beautiful"" really pulls at the heartstrings.  You'll have a good laugh, a good cry. And you'll realise life is indeed beautiful!",1200268800,,1171,5.115183246073299

The scenes and settings throughout the film are glorious.  The tension of the concentration camp setting, for both prisoners and their overseers, was palpable.

As an American viewer I was uncomfortable with the last half of the film.  It was during that portion that the lead character made light of the many awful things occurring inside the concentration camp all for the benefit and fortification of his young son.  A couple of the monologues were revealing, however.  Who would accept the absurdity of human beings being burnt in ovens and their remains being reconstituted into buttons and soap?  Of course that can't be true.

One of the main things that this film brought to me was the fact that the comedian...the one always trying to make the situation better and lighter...was the ultimate hero.  American filmmakers should learn a lesson from that.

It doesn't make light of the Holocaust, but presents an inspiring, if improbable, triumph of the human spirit over that unspeakable evil.  There are real-life Guidos in this world and when faced with a grave threat like Auschwitz, they somehow find a way to rise above it.  The late Pope John Paul II was no stranger to the horrors of Nazism and Soviet communism, especially in Poland not far from Auschwitz, and it is a fitting tribute to ""Life is Beautiful"" that he considered it his favorite movie.  It is much the same with me and I plan to see it often enough to be able to understand it in Italian without subtitles (so as to take it in more like the way it was intended).

There is no other word to describe it.  This film is beautiful, and it definitely makes you appreciate and value life more.

I know some people have trouble picturing a film whose subject matter is the Holocaust that starts out as such a bubbly comedy.  But, that is exactly the tone that the director and writers (Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami) developed, and it's brilliant.  Guido (Benigni) is a young, Jewish-Italian man with a wonderful sense of humor and a gusto for life.  He falls madly in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful woman who he continues to pursue (even when she is engaged to be married to another man!).  Of course, love conquers all.  However, the second half takes a decidedly different turn when he and his son (Giorgio Cantarini) are placed in a concentration camp.  This is when Guido's inventiveness and imagination become invaluable tools in shielding his son from the horrors they encounter there.

It is rare that I see a film that leaves me so breathless as this one does, ten years later.  This is the film that Roberto Benigni will be most remembered for, and for good reason.  I suggest that you watch this for your heart, your soul and your spirit.

1030267,5,6305426651,"My entire family adored this charming tragicomedy about life in Italy just before and during World War II.  Director and star Roberto Benigni has created a fairy tale with an edge.  An irrepressible Jewish waiter falls in love with a socialite, winning her away from her Fascist fiance with a mix of humor, coincidence, opportunism and whimsy.  They have a son and find themselves in the midst of a Jewish pogrom that transports them to an unnamed concentration camp.  Father ""Guido"" uses the same skill set that he used to win his wife to protect his four-year old son from the brutality that surrounds him, convincing him that the camp is an elaborate holiday and game in which the winner will receive a new tank.

Benigni's performance (which won a Best Actor Academy Award--rare for a foreign language film) is a masterwork--manic, touching, hilarious and affecting in about every possible way.  The scene where he translates a German soldier's camp instructions for the benefit of his son is priceless (""No lollipops!  Don't even think about asking!"") His wife Dora is beautiful and bemused in the first act and exists more symbolically, but still powerfully in the second.  The very young actor who plays son Joshua is amazing--portraying the wide-eyed enthusiasm of his father combined with a mistrustful wisdom well beyond his years.

Like the recent French film ""Amelie"", ""Beatiful"" has a whimsical soul.  The concentration camp sometimes seems a little too smooth, a feature that Spielberg films on serious subjects are sometimes accused of.  Still, the Germans were known for the their organization and order, and the story doesn't really need grisly depictions of much of what went on during the Holocaust to make its point.  The production design also fits with the fairy tale feeling of the tale.

My wife doesn't much care for foreign films, but said she felt like she'd learned some Italian watching this one.  My daughter doesn't like foreign films or period movies.  Both loved ""Life is Beautiful.""  You will too.",1186099200,2,2031,5.0

This movie is about 3 people and their love for each other in facist Italy. A man, wife and child. Unfortunately the father and son are abducted and taken to a concentration camp because they are jewish. Their mother who is not jewish insists that they take her on that train also. That's love, that's courage. From the beginning guido tries to convince his son that it is really a game. As someone who has a son close to that age i can imaging the gut wrenching pain of knowing your son is hungry, scared and miserable. Guido's lies help soften the suffering some. Nothing in this movie makes light of what went on there. His son escapes death only because he hates taking baths and is able to sneak back to their quarters. You see the hard labor, you see their numbers declining as more ""don't make it"". You see the cold heart of a nazi doctor who was a friend of guido years back but makes no effort to help him.

1030284,5,6305426651,"From the beginning of the film Italian director Robert Benigni's `Life is Beautiful' is easily identified as a masterpiece. A tale of fantasy and humor in the heart of Nazi occupied Italy, this film is centered around the fanciful story of Guido, the films central character. Guido, (Roberto Benigni) is a young Jewish librarian who lives in a world of his own fantasy. He is witty, imaginative, hilarious, a little crazy, and in a state of constant bliss. From his riddles to his endearments to his stories, Guido displays a childlike innocence that captures the heart of any person- and in the movie, captures the heart of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) his ""principessa"" (princess) and wife.

 The movie changes from a romantic comedy to a sarcastic tragedy as Guido and his son Giosu are taken to a concentration camp by the Nazi officials that occupy Italy at the time. However, despite this depressing turn of events, it is there in the horror of the camps that the magic of Benigni's story takes flight. In order to save his son's sanity, Guido invents a game for Giosu to believe/play while they are in the camp. From a complex point system, to mean candy-hogging guards, to a grand prize of a real tank, Guido lets his imagination soar as he fills Giosu's mind with stories and promises. This absurd paradigm shift is not only hilarious, but also provides a window into the depths of the human heart, which can endure all things when the light of hope is present. This part of the movie was also the most engaging, viewers will find themselves at the edge of their seats feeling as if they were also part of the game, and when Guido fumbles in his explanations you might unexpectedly hear a random helpful suggestion coming from your movie-buddy's lips.

Benigni's amazing ability to involve the audience in the plot of the movie was one of main reasons why La Vita  Bella won four academy awards in 1998. Moreover, Benigni also ties one more element into the story and the characters of Guido and Giosu- the music. Throughout their entire time in the concentration camp, the music of the movie remains happy and uplifting. Despite the hardships and cruel reality of life, the optimistic music represents the story Giosu believes. This is another great example of Benigni's gift to blend all aspects of cinematography- the characters, plot, scenery, music, and the reactions of the audience- in order to make the movie a complete and unique experience for the audience.

Because of its light representation, `Life is Beautiful' is a movie that can be seen by all audiences and I strongly recommend watching this film in its native Italian language with English subtitles. The experience, emotions, and representations do not carry the same meaning in American versions, and yes much does get lost in the translation. I also recommend watching this movie with a friend, it's a very moving film and it helps to have somebody's shoulder near you to cry on. I hope you enjoy this masterpiece just as much as I did and are able to pick out the many double-meanings in the dialogue to get the most out of your experience.

1030285,5,6305426651,"I believe it has been observed, more than once and in a variety of ways, that all of life is like a gigantic mirror. We see ourselves, everywhere. And, if we are beautiful (on the inside, where true beauty lives), then we will see beauty everywhere we look.

Life Is Beautiful puts this idea to the test. It posits a carefree, happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances a well-to-do lady in Mussolini's Italy (the film starts just on the onset of WWII). As he weds her, and they rear a child, they are soon put into jeopardy due to his Jewish heritage. Ultimately, they are sent to a Concentration Camp where his carefree, imaginitive and unceasingly joyful attitude are the only things that keep him, and his son, from utter despair.

Humor? Romance? Carefree? In a Nazi Death Camp?

To some, this is blasphemous. But to the makers of this film, and our lead character, life is beautiful, and this vision is taken from their perspective. That the film manages to show that there is joy, love and beauty--even in the worst imaginable conditions--is a testament to the way in which the film succeeds, and also to the basic truth of the message. Yes, things may be awful (and more often then not, they are)... but yes, also: life is beautiful.

Yes the Holocaust was a terrible thing and no place for comedy. However, this film was not meant to make light of the horrors so many suffered. It was meant to show how two wonderful people put love before their own comfort. Without giving away the story, this movie really showed the extent a parent and spouse will go to protect their children from pain and suffering. Though it is true that many children did suffer horribly and die in the camps, there are stories here and there of those who did manage to hide and survive. This is a fictional story representing hope for all of us despite the worst possible scenario. I truly feel it is a must-see, and an inspiration for everyone.

I was told this was a charming movie with a lot of joy within it. ""Joy despite the misery,"" is what someone said. I found it ridiculous, boring, and an insult to the memory of those who were murdered by the Third Reich. Roberto Benigni wasn't funny, just manically irritating. The actor needs either animal tranquilizers or a punch in the mouth, I'm not sure which. Maybe both.

Set against the stark reality of World War II Europe, Roberto Benigni's sentimental fable is not a film about the Holocaust, it's a film about life and hope merely against the backdrop of the Holocaust... It's not a denial of the Holocaust, it is a manifestation that humor itself can be courage... It's not about betraying the experience of millions of Jews, it is about the great lengths a father will go to protect his family from the horrors of the Nazis... It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art without claim, hope without fear, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everything--life is truly beautiful...

The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple, free-spirited Italian Jew Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore... For now, however, Guido must be satisfied to wait tables, while Ferrucio is unable to get a job...

Benigni's character is introduced during a long set of fast comedy scenes, particularly when he meets a cute gentile woman, Dora--Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife... When she 'falls out of the sky,' and he quickly nicknames her 'Principessa'... When he rides, in a fascist ball, on a horse painted green... When he turns a gloomy rainy night into a red carpet event... When he is caught by the Nazis as he hurries about securing the safety of his wife and son.. When his car speeds, without brakes, through a village and is mistaken for a king...

Guido falls hard for the radiant schoolteacher, daughter of a wealthy family, and pursues her with all the charm and imagination he can discharge... In one sequence he pretends to be a school inspector and gives an impromptu speech on racial superiority before the assembled students and teachers, ending with a striptease...

That hilarious side of the film takes up the first half... Benigni (who also wrote and directed) borrows a bit of Chaplin's grace and a bit of Groucho Marx charm... All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again with the introduction of Guido and Dora's cute five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) few years later...

There, in 1945, we catch a glimpse of their enchanting household, but things are soon shattered, and the Nazis take Guido, with his tolerant uncle (Giustino Durano) and little Giosue off to an unidentified concentration camp... Dora races to the train station and demands to be put also on the train...

At the death camp, and in order to protect his son from the nightmare of the place, Guido uses his imagination by creating the illusion that everything that's happening is just a game, an epic game that will be exciting and fun...

He convinces Giosue that by hiding from the Gestapo soldiers (whom he refers to simply as the ""men who yell a lot"") and maintaining silence, he can gain the necessary points to win a tank... Not a toy tank, but a full-size tank, which they'll be free to take home...

As co-writer, Benigni (with Vincenzo Cerami), doesn't just mix drama and comedy, he often hides drama in the comedy... The film does not dwell on the horrors of the camp, nor does it ignore them...

With a memorable score by Nicola Piovani, ""Life Is Beautiful"" is an important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime... It manages to entertain, educate, and move with its potent combination of humor, poignancy, and dignity... Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son... As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations... He was very realistic, natural, distant from great special effects, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema...

The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Score...",1168905600,5,4273,4.920833333333333

The first half of the movie is lighthearted, funny, sweet with Roberto Benigni shining (he just makes you love him).  Without going into the plot which can be read up top, the second half of the movie is set in a Nazi concentration camp.  Which is, of course a subject that is not funny at all.

Benigni didn't make this movie as a historical documentary (to those that may argue that the story is unrealistic).  As viewers we are spared the horror of what the camps may have really been like for the sake of the true intent of the movie which in my opinion is to show how a father spares his young son the reality of where they really are, out of love and through laughter and imagination. I might make it sound hokey but the whole package is genius.

 Overall, it's a lovely movie but don't expect lighthearted comedy. It's very bittersweet.  (for lack of a better word) There are some truly sad parts.  One of my all time favorite movies....I had tears streaming down my cheeks when I left the theater.",1164240000,4,1238,4.243589743589744

1030329,5,6305426651,"Life is Beautiful is a film by Roberto Benigni, which really showcases his talent before he made an embarassing stab at playing Pinocchio. ""Life is Beautiful"" is probably my favorite Foreign film (I've only seen probably 5 though); It's funny, heartfelt, has wonderful performances, and is all around a joy to watch. It also happens to be a layered film, that goes in one direction before veering off into another but never losing it's charm. Benigni plays Guido, a waiter with a humorous streak. After Guido contantly stumbles into Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), he falls in love with her and the movie (with no warning) flashes forward a number of years. This first half of the film (which is a little over 50 minutes) is pretty much a romantic-comedy. The second half is quite different. In the second half, Guido and Dora (who now have a young son named Joshua) live in Italy which is overrun with Germans. Subsequently, Guido and Joshua are taken into a concentration camp; Dora also goes to the camp, but under different circumstances which are a bit unbelievable but still a nice part of the story. Anyway, Guido employs his quick-wit to keep his son from the horrors of the camp; Guido tells Josh that it's actually an elaborate game and that he must avoid being seen. If, at the end, he does everything he's told and racks up the most ""points"" he will get a tank. Benigni (who is also the co-writer and director) does something that's never been done. He takes a horrifying setting (a concentration camp) and turns it into a comedy, without exploting anything and without losing heart.

The film takes a sad turn in the end, which I think adds to it's realism. If it had a completely happy ending, I don't think it would work as well. Even if you're not a person who watches foreign film, this is an absolute masterpiece and to not see this film would be a mistake. This is a wonderful film, with Benigni (who I think is the first person to win an Oscar for Best Actor for a foreign language film, although I could be wrong) giving an absolutely delightful performance. I really don't see how someone could not enjoy this film.

He sweeps the woman of his dreams, his ""Principessa"", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.

Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.

1030363,5,6305426651,"Released to movie theaters in 1998, like many people, I could not conceive how a comedy and satire about the Holocaust would be an award-winning film ... yet having viewed it, I *do* now understand: it is the personality of Roberto Benigni who uses Charlie Chaplinesque comedy techniques to emphasize the tragic events which seem even more intense as the viewer knows the truth. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a waiter who moves to Arezzo, Italy and literally bumps into Dora (played by Nicoletta Braschi, his real-life wife), a stylish and attractive young lady, with whom he instantly falls in love, only to learn she is engaged to someone else. As luck would have it, he is the waiter at their engagement reception - where all kinds of mishaps occur, as Guido tries to engage Dora's attention. He accidentally drops something on the floor and crawls beneath the table to retrieve it while Dora peeks under the table and crawls half-way to meet him ... where they exchange a secret kiss (despite her fiance sitting at the table). One thing leads to another, Guido magically rides in on a green-painted horse, sweeping Dora up onto the saddle with him, as they ride off ... together to be married.

Next, more than five years has passed, as the present turns into the future, within the courtyard of Guido's home ... Their son Joshua is the sunshine of their lives, as he sits on the bicycle along side his mother, as Guido peddles into the town. Joshua tends the bookstore while his dad is taken off to the police station, to register as a Jewish store owner. Guido does the famous goose-step routine to entertain his son ... Shortly afterwards, on Joshua's birthday, the local Jewish population is taken off to internment. Guido tells Joshua a story about going on a trip, a secret trip, only his mother knows about it. Guido establishes the rules of the game, where on this trip, if they earn 1000 points, Joshua wins a *real* tank. As a little boy, Joshua is in love with his toy tank ...

There are numerous poignant scenes within the film which emphasize the risks Guido is willing to take to keep his wife and son safe from harm. He manages to send Dora a very personal message by playing an opera song on a loudspeaker, and even Joshua gets in a loving message to his mother. Guido continues the game, despite Joshua's suspicions, as other prisoners give him messages of what is truly happening at the camp. One of the most bizzare twists is when, Joshua manages to escape from taking a shower ... his dad says, you should take the shower (as meaning a real cleansing one) ... not knowing that Joshua's life was held in the balance, and tilted toward ""life"" by having refused and run away from the shower which meant *certain* death. The rescue scene by an American soldier, who has Joshua hop on board for a ride is very moving ... especially when realizing Guido who was dressed as a woman with a babushka tied beneath her chin, had just been caught, and led away into an alley, where gunfire was heard in the distance. The German soldier walked out alone ... The fact is, Guido sacrified himself in search of his family after the war was declared over, and in the end, had died in the attempt to keep his family alive. To appreciate the magic of this film ... it must viewed, with an open mind. There is no doubt in my mind, the film deserves the 70 world-wide film festival awards it has won ... including the prestigious Gran Prix at Cannes, three awards in Jerusalem, including the Mayor's award and the Jerusalem Medal,  Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards and at the European Film Awards, Best Film and Best Actor.

She is wearing a starched clean white nanny apron over her uniform complete with black boots, her face devoid of warmth; which pretty much describes the reality of this film.",1152057600,5,447,4.743589743589744

Guido's exuberance and zest for life, regardless of the circumstances in which he finds himself, make a profound and lasting impression.

I initially shyed away because of the hype surrounding all of the Academy Awards it won, but upon seeing it, immediately realized why it won and wondered why it didn't get Best Picture as well.

You won't regret taking the time to watch this one!  If you possibly can, the Italian version (with subtitles) is beautiful.  It loses just a little bit in translation when you watch the English version, the jokes change a little, but it's stil wonderful.

1030367,5,6305426651,"If this story ended just after Guido married Dora it would still be one of the best movies I have seen. In its entirety it is  truly a masterpiece and in many ways.

First, Guido's  joking, humorous, positive attitude is a great example for all of us to follow.  We each create our own realities. We can't change a lot of things,so why not not be happy and make jokes about everything,like Guido does, even when life is at its darkest moments?

Second, Begnini takes a very serious drama of one of the darkest periods in history and makes a comedy out of it.

Third,who would think that Dora, a gentile, would finally choose to marry the lowly Guido, when she is already the fiance of a wealthy (but boring) aristocrat.  The scene where he steals her away is wonderful. If you ever want to explain the use of Jewish  chutzpah, this scene is as good as it gets.

Finally,this is a romantic masterpiece. Guido's devotion to his wife and son is perhaps the most overpowering part of the movie. If only we could all treat our wives and children that way! Their happiness and security is all he lives for. He puts their lives ahead of his no matter what the consequences.

The ending of the movie is so touching, you must be prepared to cry. Have several handerchiefs handy.

Neither do Holocaust deniers, apologists, the Arab press, historians, the anti-defamation league, the ACLU, Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Israelis, Americans... I won't go on. And here we have this movie, which is a gem.

There are many aspects of this movie that make it a five star movie if not a ""classic"" yet. I want to touch on these so that those who have not seen the movie or own the movie consider keeping it in their DVD collection for those times...

First, the Italian bravado for life and love and the good things, similar to the great film Mediteraneo; Second, the humanity of those who believe that la vita e bella, even during a pandemic of human psychosis and hate (sound familiar); Third, the story, which allows us to see at the same time horror but laughter, and laughter is the best medicine; and finally, the unique flow of the movie. If Roberto Benigni, the directors, the camera crew, and the screen writers only made one film, this film, they would still have contributed a masterpiece and could retire. It is  funny, horrific, but ultimately redeeming. It is a movie that one never tires of watching.

Those Italians, dio mio! You laugh and cry at the same time, an emotional experience that runs the gamut. How do they do it? So ife is beautiful even if the movie is not perfect.  If you are feeling (strongly!) that it is not, watch this film. One never exhausts of it.

1030370,5,6305426651,"I never saw Life is Beautiful when it first came out but always meant to when I found time. However, in the years since its release, I had quite forgotten about it until something I read recently rekindled my desire to view it. So I looked it up here, bought it, and enjoyed it several times.

The idea of a Holocaust comedy is intriguing and I sure wanted to see how something like that could be done tastefully. This film shows how that can be done.

Roberto Benigni is magnificent as Guido, a man who has such a cheerful outlook on life that very little can faze him for long. The film begins with Guido and a friend barreling down a twisting highway seemingly out of control in a car with failed brakes. They come into a town where a crowd lines the road awaiting the motorcade of the king and queen, not fascist officials as one reviewer said. As Guido frantically waves them aside, they think he is the king saluting and they salute him in return, and are still doing so when the real motorcade arrives with the impatient-looking royal couple inside. And the comedy continues...

I won't rehash the entire movie, others have done so, but suffice to say that Guido is such an irrepressible guy that he finds it within himself to have an outwardly positive attitude about everything even when all seems hopeless.

To me, the key parts of the film are:

1) The way in which he courts the beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) and persists even when it looks as though she seems almost sure to be wed to a wealthy and debonair childhood friend. How he snatches her from under that stuffed shirt's nose is hilarious.

2) The way he reacts to the anti-Semitism lite of fascist society. He keeps his head up, a smile on his face and tries to brush it off. When his young son Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini, asks about a sign on a shop that forbids entry to dogs and Jews, Guido deflects the emotional blow by joking that everyone has his own dislikes and that down the street there are other shops forbidding entry to other groups. So, since he (Guido) doesn't like Visigoths and his son doesn't like spiders, they will post a sign in their bookstore forbidding entry to Visigoths and spiders!

3)When Germans occupy part of Italy toward the end of the war, the soft anti-Semitism of Mussolini's regime gives way to the hard-core anti-Semitism of the Nazis. The town's Jews, Guido and Joshua among them, are rounded up and shipped out to a labor camp. When Dora informs the German commander that there must be a mistake, he looks at his list, sees that Guido and Joshua are Jews, and assures her there is no mistake at all and suggests she go home. She demands to be shipped out as well and is granted her wish.

 In the camp, Guido has to use all his powers of persuasion and imagination to keep the truth of their predicament from his son. He tells the doubting boy that they are in an elaborate contest to win a tank, and if he remains undiscovered, he will accrue the thousand points needed to win. How he manages to keep his son from being detected and how he keeps his spirits up, even when worry and apprehension lie just beneath his upbeat facade, is a wonder to see. His seeming optimism in the face of looming disaster even helps his fellow captives grimly endure. I don't want to give it all away, so it will suffice to say that Guido is ever the jokester to the end.

We've all heard the expression ""If life gives you lemons, make lemonade."". Well, Life Is Beautiful is a prime example of someone doing just that. And while we all can't be happy-go-lucky types, that is the trait that let Guido carry on in what would be an untenable situation for most people. And that is the trait that helped him help his son live to see a new dawn.

All the lead characters give excellent performances, especially Benigni. The German characters are largely stereotypically sneering and bossy hate-filled Nazis, about the only sympathetic one being the camp doctor. There are a few scenes that are literally not credible, but even with these the movie is well worth seeing for the lessons it imparts and for the warm feelings you have at the end.",1145923200,3,4145,4.49136786188579

1030374,5,6305426651,"The use of humor throughout the film Life is Beautiful allows the movie to accurately represent the horrors of World War II without being dark. One could argue that the humor takes away from the seriousness, dignity, and respect with which the Holocaust should be portrayed. However, there already exists an abundance of humorless, depressing movies concerning the Holocaust and the Second World War. Also, the humor is not at the expense of the Jewish people, but rather the [...] ideals. In my favorite scene, in which the main character jumps up on the table in the school and showcases himself as an example of the racial purity of the Italians, the whole notion of racial purity is being made fun of, since he is in reality a Jewish person himself.
 I personally think that using comedy in this film was a great idea. The comedic aspect of this movie has helped it reach a much wider audience than the vast majority of Holocaust related movies. The fact that Life is Beautiful is relatively well-known in the United States is an achievement in and of itself, seeing as Americans tend to dislike having to read sub-titles and not be able to understand Italian. It would certainly be possible for a movie to go completely overboard, trying to make everything into a joke, which would have the effect of cheapening the war and the Holocaust. A movie that contains so many jokes that it approaches absurdity and completely neglects the trauma and horrors of the Holocaust would be offensive and very hurtful to those people who experienced the Holocaust first-hand.",1143676800,2,1566,4.821561338289963

The way that a fathers struggle to protect his child from the horrific acts around them was portrayed so well that it brought tears to my eyes...a wonderful film...just concentrate on the feelings not the historical accuracy.,1141084800,12,668,4.1461538461538465

1030400,5,6305426651,"I've read numerous review from people who believe that this film is a crime in itself, that it makes light of the Holocaust and ignores the depth of human tragedy that occurred during that unspeakable period in time.  Those who think in this manner do not understand how ""remembrance"" takes place, do not understand the human psyche.  Only survivors can know the true horror; the millions of humans who did not live that horror cannot comprehend it.  Attempts to MAKE them comprehend it, put forth in anger and guilt, only numb us to its realities.  I've read many histories of the Holocaust, many accounts; I respect those who lived through the nightmare enough to believe them when they tell me that ""You who did not go through this can never understand.""  They are right.  And so, as an artist, how do I help the world remember?  If we must force ourselves to remember--and to honor those who died, to keep ourselves from repeating history, we are morally responsible for remembrance--than we must do so in a manner that the millions who did NOT experience the Holocaust can comprehend.  And that is done by juxtaposing the human next to the inhumane; laughter next to horror (to a level we can imagine it).  It is this juxtaposition--the beautiful next to the monstrous--that helps those who were not there remember their own humanity, and honor the memory of those who suffered and died. The monstrous can only be depicted in art through imagination; the reality can never be depicted.  But that holy, redemptive juxtaposition of the sacredness of life next to utter inhumanity helps we, the ones who have the moral responsiblity to remember, keep continually aware of both our responsibility and our humanity.  And that juxtaposition is precisely what ""Life is beautiful"" accomplishes.  Spielberg did the same with ""Schindler's List"" (in a more straightforward manner, but the same juxtaposition).  Both films were denigrated by those who erroneously believe that flogging the world with anger and guilt is the way to honor those who died.  It is not; instead, such actions kill the victims of the Holocaust again and again.  Honoring the beauty of the life force that was robbed from them is how we keep their memory alive, and how we promise them that it will never happen again.",1140220800,11,2287,4.873385012919897
1030401,3,6305426651,"This movie has fun, charm, and nice romance; everything except a respect for the darkness of The Holacuast. The first hour is a nice romantic starter, and is often quite pleasing. The second half, supposedly taking place in a concentration camp with Benini and his son, and about his struggle to regain his love, is obsurd, and makes a mockery of one of the worst periods of human exsistance. He wants his son to think it's all a game. I undestand he's trying to shield him from the worst, but one can't wonder if he does more harm than good, and it's at this point the movie loses its credebility. And the ending is just way too sappy.

This has to be one of the most overrated films around. Comedy does not override a serious tragedy when one is talking about the Holacaust. Benini's performance is one note and not particularly appealing at the end. How the Academy gave him the Oscar I can't understand. I'm so devided in halfs about this film.

1030406,5,6305426651,"This film is two fantasies in one.  The first half of the film is a romantic comedy.  Guido's (Roberto Begnini) car breaks down and he meets Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) at her family farm.  For him it's love at first sight but he will never see his ""princi pessa"" again.  He continues to Rome to work for his uncle as a waiter.  And who does he run into, Dora.  He sees Dora again at the restaurant.  The only problem is it's her engagement party.  This does not deter Guido and he pursues her and eventually wins her love.

Five year passes and Guido and Dora are deliriously happy and they have a son.  The only problem is WWII and Italy's alliance with Germany.  Fascism and anti-Semitism are in full swing.  Guido does everything to protect his son from this.  But eventually, it becomes too real and he and his son are deported to a concentration camp.  Dora, who is Catholic, will not let her two men go alone and she goes with them.  (This is where I have a small issue, as she is Catholic, the boy would have been raised Catholic and I don't think the church would have let the boy be deported).

They arrive at the camp and the Guido and his son are separated from Dora.  Guido is warned not the let the boy leave the barracks.  Guido tells the boy that this is a game and tells him the rules, including that the winner gets a tank (This is a hilarious scene.)  Guido does everything to shield the boy from the reality.  Eventually, the Americans liberate the camp.

The one thing that I hated about the film was the ending but this film cannot have a truly satisfying ending.  Therefore, you have to live with the ending.

As I stated at the beginning, this is a fantasy.  The second half of the film could never happen but this is a film about love and you must look at the film from this point of view.  The moral is that with love anything can be accomplished and that is why Life is Beautiful.  This is a great film and must be seen by everyone.

Note: I have only seen the subtitled version and have been told that the dubbed is not as good but still is excellent.

There are no jokes to be mined from this history.  To find humor in it would require revision if not denial of the truth--which is what ""Life is Beautiful"" is all about.

1030441,5,6305426651,"I saw this movie for the first time some years ago. Up to now, I think there hasn't been any other movie that I had enjoyed more. Not only for its wonderful story but also for the great performances on it... Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi plays are really breathtaking... but how to forget that wonderful kid called Giorgio Cantarini (Giosue on the movie)

This story tells the nice and quite life of a Jewish man (Guido) who falls in love with a beautiful school teacher (Dora). His permanent and occurrent humor sense and persistence gets Dora's heart... movie goes softly with many humoristic scenes and situations. Some years later, Giosue appears in scene, having Guido and Dora already married. The unexpected comes with a Nazi guard arrives to this happy family. Guido and his very young child are taken by the force to a Nazi death camp. Dora's love is stronger than anything and she leaves everything to join her family at the same hell.

Then, the most dramatic (and unforgettable) situations are shown. Guido makes everything to make Giosue believe they are part of a game which will give to the winner a tank car. Even when Guido finishes his extremely-hard working days, he's still smily and full of imagination to make this white lie bigger. Although Guido's duties, he manages to get his sweetheart a love message, an operah play that Dora attented when they weren't together.

After many situations, Guido knows the war is finishing and hides his little boy from Nazis soldiers. He tries to rescue his wife but he's caught by a soldier... who has no mercy with him. After some silent moments, Giosue comes out and he realizes is in front of the game winner's price... a real tank car. An American soldier rescues him and during the way home he sees his mum... who had also escaped from that nightmare.

This movie has become a real classic of the film history, it's not a marketing product... it's a real masterpiece. For much, the best movie I've seen in many, many years... my all time favourite movie? I'd probably say: YES.

Now, you just should... Enjoy it!",1131062400,4,2085,4.717032967032967

""Life Is Beautuiful"" plays like two movies; the first hour a charming romantic comedy, the second hour a drama set in a concentration camp.  But even in the face of death in the second half, this film makes me laugh and cry, a rare emotional quality few movies have offered in recent years.

First off, I'd like to say that this is a truly magical film, and I have no idea how the producers managed to do it. It's so ugly, but at the same time, so beautiful. The whole time you're watching, you're crying, but also smiling at the same time.

La Vita E Bella [Life is Beautiful] is the story about a young, secular Jewish family in Italy during the Holocaust. It tells about the love of a father to his child. The father risks everything he's got - his life - to make his and his son's stay at a concentration camp a tad bit more bearable by pretending everything is just a game. He is a hilarious character.

I have a few problems with this movie, though. For one thing, it's incredibly historically inaccurate, but that doesn't really bother me that much, because the main point of the film does get across. My main concern with the movie, though, is how real Holocaust survivors actually feel about it. Unfortunately, most seem to think it's mocking them. They believe the movie makes everything that happened seem trivial and not as bad as it truly was. I hate to admit it, but, in a way, they are partially correct.

Life is Beautiful does make the Holocaust become fiction, but, at the same time, it's simply a masterpiece. I've found it extremely hard to make up my mind about this movie. However, if you've never watched it - and you can clearly separate truth from fiction - this movie is simply a must-see.",1125878400,3,1659,4.4295081967213115

Despite the horrible situation, he just make fun of it and provided the most interesting and funny days for his young son.

""Life Is Beautiful"" is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It is deeply emotional on all levels and brings home the terrible truth that was the Holocaust. But much more than that, the movie is a deep reflection of all that is best in humanity, and our ability to find joy and love even in the darkest of situations. It touches deeply the spiritual nature of laughter and the amazing, omipotent, world changing power of Love.

1030476,5,6305426651,"This is one of the best and most creative films ever made. Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams,his ""Principessa"", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.

Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.

In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.

While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.

I didn't feel that it took the Holocaust lightly -- in fact, I found that this movie helped me understand the true impact of the holocaust in a way that a documentary or even a heart-wrenching movie like ""Schindler's List"" could not.  You are introduced, at length, to a wonderful little family that shares a deep and abiding love.  You become attached to the characters in a way that no other Holocaust movie, in my opinion, achieves.  The transition to the death camp is shocking.  And yet it underlines the amazing power of love -- facing unimaginable horrors, the Benigni character refuses defeat, and puts all of his soul and effort into saving his son, not only from death, but from the scarring knowledge of the hell that is all around him.  The father's love for his wife and son are truly inspiring.

It may be true that this is unrealistic... how does anyone know how they would act in such a situation?  But it is uplifting to believe that it is possible to defeat evil with love, even if one loses one's life in the process.",1122768000,,1064,4.505208333333333

I never cry at movies; I laughed during Titanic, only one part got me on Beaches, I hated The Notebook (it was the second movie to make me cry).  The characters in Life is Beautiful are all too real, and human.  It puts a face on something that for many of us is only a memory to our parents and grandparents.  The Holocaust and World War II was one of the scariest times in American history, but oh, how soon we forget.  Life is Beautiful has the capacity to remind us.  I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 11.  The subject line is too deep for too many children.  I have not seen the movie in its entirety since that day over six years ago, but this movie changed my life.  I believe that good movies entertain, as well as teach you something.

But we started to watch the movie and it was!  It was hilarious for the first part, at least.  My favorite comedic scene was when he pretended to be a school inspector and talked about Italian bellybuttons.  My other favorite scene is at the end of the movie.  When the tank comes.  The little boy was adorable.

This is a moving tale of a light-hearted father protecting his son from the terrible and tragic reality of the Holocaust by weaving a cocoon of an imaginary and simple world.

The movie comes with a philosophy, that even in the ugliest of times, we can portray a beautiful life with things as simple but beautiful as love, family and imagination.

At the same time, the movie does not discard the gravity of the holocaust. The movie is so subtle that even without portraying the cruel scenes visually, it creates tension at a subconscious level.

There are plenty of other settings for the director to get his point across of offering hope to his son. Using the Holocaust in this manner is a disgrace. This is also a typical Hollywood film (I know its a foreign film) since it uses plenty of manipulative ploys to draw in an uncritical audience. This is Holocaust revisionism writ to celluloid. Have you ever seen a Holocaust survivor laughing and smiling like the idiot in this film.

Putting the kid in the tank was beyond reprehensible. The irony of that scene juxtaposed against the concentration camps and the understanding that the German blitzkrieg is what initiated WWII must be lost on the director and most clueless, antiseptic viewers.

This is the reality the film deliberately masks (then again maybe Benigni doesn't know it, doesn't want to know it, or doesn't believe it):

""There was a sign `to disinfection.' He said `you see,they are bringing children now.' They opened the door, threw the children in and closed the door. There was a terrible cry.

A member of the SS climbed on the roof. The people went on crying for about ten minutes. Then the prisoners opened the doors. Everything was in disorder and contorted. Heat was given off. the bodies were loaded on a rough wagon and taken to a ditch. The next batch were already undressing in the huts. After that I didn't look at my wife for four weeks.""

Too many of the characters ""disappeared"" throughout the movie as well. And I don't mean they were killed off. What happened to Guido's friend in the beginning? What ever happened to Dora's fiance? What was the significance in the grandmother's reappearance? And what about the doctor and ""It has to be the duckling!!""? Wasn't he reintroduced to the story in order to help and play some part in the outcome? But he really didn't at all. And personally, I hardly think there's anything funny about Nazi death camps. (Which, by the way, were not portrayed as severe as in actuality. I realize the movie was not meant to be historical, but I don't find myself very comfortable with this sugar-coated version of a camp, especially when so many people have actually denied the existence of them all together, it just seems too touchy -and important- a subject to overlook its seriousness.) Although the father may have had good intentions continually lying to his child, in reality that kid would have just turned out really MESSED UP, not to mention Guido would have been killed nearly 10 times throughout the movie.

He showed genius in winning the love of his life, in protecting his son from the cruelty of others and in sacrificing himself for his son.  Is slapstick appropriate for the subject ?  It is when seen in the eyes of a father glancing at his son and knowing that these people will kill his son if he does not keep his son ""in the game"".

1030535,4,6305426651,"With this opening line, Roberto Benigni, Director, lead character, and writer (with Vincenzo Cerami) of this film, establishes its symbolic, rather than realistic, emphasis.  Set in 1930s Italy, the film opens as a slapstick comedy, with the rubber-faced Benigni (who won the Academy Award as Best Actor for this role) playing Guido Orifice, a hyperactive clown, as he repeatedly surprises a beautiful young woman, acts as the clever hotel waiter, and attempts to exchange hats with men he meets.

Despite the frantic comedy, however, the fascist dictatorship and the growing anti-semitism loom constantly in the background, as Guido's uncle (Giustino Durano) is assaulted, his horse is painted green, and a local school principal talks about getting rid of defectives.  After a lovely segue to represent the passage of six years or so, we again see Guido, now married to his beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), and meet Giosue Orifice, his son, winningly played by six-year-old Giorgio Cantorini.  Totally committed to protecting his son from the horrors of anti-semitism, Giorgio turns everything into a joke.

When the family is eventually rounded up and shipped to a concentration camp, Guido turns the event into a ""birthday surprise"" for Giosue and tries to ensure his survival by pretending that all the events are part of a huge game, with the winner getting a full-sized tank. Disappearances from the camp are explained as people dropping out of the game.

In some ways, Guido's game-playing sets the reality of the concentration camps into sharp relief, intensifying the horror by showing the lengths to which a father will go to protect the innocence of his child.  The viewer knows that the game is a pitiful, and ultimately hopeless, attempt to hold back the reality of the Final Solution but cannot help hoping that against all odds, somehow Guido and Giosue will win.  The horrors of the Holocaust are obvious here, and the ironies of seeing both Guido and his captors all playing some sort of macabre ""game"" will not be lost on the viewer.

I thoroughly enjoyed Benigni's pratfalls, his touching attention to his family, the music (by Nicola Piovani, which also won an Academy Award), and the cleverness of the plot.  But I also found that my realistic knowledge of the Holocaust was so overwhelming I could not ""suspend [my] disbelief,"" and I was unable to appreciate the film as the wonder-filled ""fable"" Benigni intended.

1030536,4,6305426651,"The first half of this film was a fun lighthearted sweet romantic comedy, which really contrasts with the second half, which despite having some funny moments, is very serious and depressing in tone, almost as though it were an entirely different movie.  The second half of the movie gives me mixed feelings; I believe Benigni's heart was in the right place when he made this movie, but by and large the second half is so unrealistic and even tasteless in parts that it insults what really happened.  I was even sick to my stomach when Guido was making light of how Giosue had told him that he'd heard that people were being made into soap and buttons and being burnt in ovens, joking about washing himself and buttoning up with their friends in the Barracks and how the ovens weren't burning people fast enough, trying to make him see how ""ridiculous"" it was to believe such things.  And what camp are they supposed to be in that has such horrible security and where a child not only goes ungassed on arrival but also undetected the entire time he's there?  There were instances where underage inmates or invalids who had been smuggled out of the hospital were able to be hidden for a time, but before long nearly all of them were found out, and the person or people hiding them were likely killed also.  The voiceover at the end suggests that this is a true story, though I have a hard time believing that.

I can accept that some things had to be modified for practical purposes while still conveying the truth of what happened; for example, not stuffing the cattle car with as many people as the Nazis really stuffed into them, or the actors playing the inmates not dropping down to 40 pounds each, but what remains is still unrealistic (albeit well-meaningly so).  People aren't greeted with screams, kicks, beatings, slaps, curses, and barking dogs when they unboard the cars (in a very orderly way!), their heads aren't shaved, the portions are too large and healthy-looking, there is no Kapo or other sadistic prisoner put in charge of the inmates in the Barracks, no searchlights till the very end, an incredibly unrealistic evacuation of the camp, too many prisoners alive (and healthy-looking) at the end on the death march that is liberated, and no security.  We know this camp has a gas chamber, so it can't be one of the milder camps like Westerbork where families could be together and children were allowed to live, yet if it had been one of those types of camps, the child wouldn't have had to be hidden either.  This camp has so little security it's like a revolt and escape waiting to happen!  And where is the delousing process that greeted the prisoners lucky enough to live (during which Giosue would certainly have been detected), where they had to undress, got their heads shaved, were driven into an icy-cold shower, were thrown raggy prisoner rags, and had to pick a pair of shoes, no matter how ill-fitting or mismatched, from a mammoth pile of them?

If this were a real Vernichtungslager, the child would have had no doubts about what kind of place they really were in.  The few children selected to live (for medical experimentation or sexual exploitation primarily) didn't have any doubts about where they were or what was happening to them.  In a real extermination camp, the Kapo or whomever was put in charge of each Block rounded up the people trying to escape going off to work each day and beat them.  That child would have been detected during one of these searches to see if anyone were hiding in there and trying to avoid labour.  The Nazis were constantly counting the prisoners and searching the Barracks and other buildings to make sure everyone was accounted for and that no one was trying to hide!

Overall it was a very sweet movie about a father's love for his son (and in the first half how he won the heart of the boy's mother), but unfortunately the inaccuracies in the second half spoilt some of my enjoyment of this movie.  And as well-meaning as the people who produced this movie may very well have been, it unfortunately will be fodder for the historical revisionists, who will point to it as ""proof"" that the Shoah really wasn't all that bad.",1094256000,6,4198,4.6437246963562755

However, until I saw the film earlier today on TV, I'd never before heard of ""Life Is Beautiful"".  The story of Guido is brilliantly unique among the scores of Holocaust dramas.  Strangely, the impacts ""Life is Beautiful"" had on me were two, and diametrically opposite:  This story is exquisitely beautiful; uplifting and funny.  But this story broke my heart.

The world could not survive for a day without people like Guido, and he is also the kind of person the world can never have too many of.  I think that he is able to maintain his child's innocense because he himself never loses his own.  When something funny happens it is only because Guildo still has his sense of humor.

1030542,5,6305426651,"When I watched Life Is Beautiful I wasn't at all impressed - at 1st I wasn't. Not until the scene where Guido is forced to pretend to be a fascist leader indoctrinating children at the school (where the woman he loves is teacher). My stomach turned in this scene. And the whole meaning of the movie came to me like an avalanche. Guido's pretending symbolized many things. That when people are put in inhumane situations they will be forced to find ways to ""work around"" the situation in order to survive (for instance...I'm sure that the slaves that built the pyramids laughed & joked about their inhumane situation & about the ones in power in order to make life bearable...forced to be a slave but also forced to find a way to make life more humane when a humane life simply should be a given). Though he thought he was being clever in speaking in the way he thought the leader of the fascist movement would speak he unwittingly hit the nail on the head - Guido used the same words the real fascist leader would use but from a different point-of-view. Though Guido was innocent of the far-reaching implications of fascism he knew, on some level, what the policies were (enough to be able to pretend to be the leader that was suppose to be there instead). His playful speech is in actuality the same speech the leader would make but from different angles: Guido's own angle is one of joking disbelief regarding the philosophies of facism; the fascist leader (when he arrives) would say exactly the same words but said in total & unwavering belief in the fascist's philosophy. If you can imagine the real fascist leader in that classroom making that speech instead of Guido you'll see what I see.
Guido using the horse that was painted green as a symbol against Jews is something we all do - we joke & laugh off insane political philosophies but we can only do that for so long because they simply can gain power & control that will turn everyone's life upside down (as shown in this movie).  I'm sure, in that time, there were people brave enough to use facist symbols as a joke & to ridicule facist beliefs. Benigni showed that brilliantly in that scene.
This movie also revealed that parents basically have no idea what their children are being taught (well back then I think that was the case). Benigni included that scene for that reason - children were being taught facism. His playful pursuit of his love to the school allowed that subtle implication to be included in the movie without hitting everyone over the head with that fact. The teachers standing meekly by while Guido made his speech symbolized how people can really be oblivious to a dangerous philosophy. I'm sure most people couldn't imagine how something like facism could nearly destroy the world. That's what the teachers symbolized to me.
The whole beginning of the movie hit me like a ton of rocks after the schoolroom scene (this explains the beginning of the movie). That life is made up with many chances & sometimes coincidences & even unbearable situations all at once. Though chance & coincidences can bring joy in our lives (Guido meeting the ""princess"" all by chance for the very 1st time) chance can bring a lot of misery too (facism growing & becoming extremely powerful by strokes of chances & coincidences). That with enough ""chances"" & ""coincidences"" situations (good or bad) will grow & take hold (Guido constantly running into the schoolteacher by coincidences & chance allowed their love to grow...I think he was telling us that is how facism grew which is all by chances & coincidences...enough of these 2 things & you may have something dangerous OR something wonderful depending on the situation).
On many levels Benigni showed how something like facism can grow out of control in the real world. The beginning of the movie people live their lives as they see fit (Guido going where the wind blows in trying to win the teacher's heart). Then a new philosophy seeps over the horizon but no one really pays attention (the schoolroom scene...Guido joked but was oblivious to the implications that facism had if it ever had real power & many followers). Some people will make political satire out of this new idea (Guido on the green horse). If the new philosophy gains power it will benefit a person's life or interfere with their life depending on who you are OR who they say you are (Guido's store failing because of the new policies and because the policies doomed him & his family). And eventually total control over everyone's life & sometimes to the extreme in which it's decided who lives & who dies (the concentration camps).
I was rather startled by the very simple ending with Joshua being reunited with his mother. All I can say is that Benigni understands human nature very well - people will continue to live their lives & history will repeat itself. He doesn't show an end to facism but possibly the beginning of more if people don't try to come out of their shells & try to make a difference. A simple ending yet a powerful statement. Perhaps he also wanted to say that some people remained unchanged by tragedy because most people just want to live no matter what happened in the past or what may happen in the future. It seems that he wanted to show that though there are some things that our beyond our control happiness & love are never beyond our control.
I won't touch on the heart-wrenching scenes of the concentration camp. I wanted to reveal all the other parts that have been missed (or maybe they have not been missed...I'm just guessing here) From what I've read just about everyone has criticized the beginning of the movie which was in fact a reality check - things can creep into your life without being noticed until it's too late. And that's what happened in the beginning of the movie - facism showed up here & there in different scenes but always in a subtle & an unthreatening way like in real life. I'm sure, at the time, most people didn't feel facism was a threat (political parties & philosophies live & die time all the time). The most horrific fact is that no one really knows what are the real intentions of this type of philosophy until they actually have power.
Bravo Benigni. Your movie is pure genius. And the most humane movie I've ever seen.",1088726400,5,6280,4.64748201438849
1030574,1,6305426651,"Yes, I know I am in the minority here, but I absolutely loathed this movie. For benefit of the doubt reasons, I did watch it twice, just to ensure my reaction was intellectual as well as emotional (even worse the second time). I still remember Steven Spielberg's face at the Academy Awards -- he hated this film, and I understand why.

Nothing in this movie rang true, nothing; false from beginning to end: even the sets reminded me of Disney, a movie stage. No camp ever resembled anything in this film. Roberto Benigni is little more than a clown without the soft, sad core, and had no business manipulating a subject as horrific as 'Shoah' to suite his broad, comedic purposes. Nowhere do we see the true nature of anti-Semitism, or Nazi viciousness; it is all soft focus, blunted and romantic. Curiously sterile. As a result, I felt nothing, no sympathy, only anger. So contaminated I needed a shower.

My mother, a survivor of the war, whom I asked to watch the movie, could not stomach it. She said it was ""repulsive"" and ""disgusting"", an unrealistic fantasy that made light of a collective experience. She was in her early twenties then and clearly remembers the war. I have also spoken with other survivors, Jewish and Gentile (including Italian) over who have seen 'Life is Beautiful' (granted, a small number -- fifteen or sixteen): I dare not print the invectives. One very elderly gentleman I spoke with a few years ago shook his head, spat, and wept -- ""this funny man should rot. He does not understand."" This gentleman has since passed on.

It seems Europeans who lived through the war as victims of Axis torture have a different perspective from most of these reviewers. The scars are still too deep and hard for many to stomach this travesty. No one can tell these people to ""get over it, it's just a movie"", a phrase I have actually heard.

The movie has two distinct halves: the first is comical and is about how the main character Guido falls in love with a woman named Dora. The second half is dramatic. This is when they get married and have a son and get taken to a concentration camp. It is sad to see the devotion Guido has to his son and how much trouble he goes to to make sure his son doesn't get horrified by the truth of what is going on.
The DVD also deserves 5 Stars. The picture is very clear and presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio (if you don't know what I'm talking about, go to [...] The Italian audio quality is also very good. But whatever you do, do not watch this movie dubbed! The English does not fit at all with the Italian, and some lines have been re-written (horribly) to better coincide with the Italian. Also, the actors who did the dubbing seem to switch back and forth between really fake Italian accents and American accents. Trust me, after about 15 minutes you'll forget you're reading subtitles, you just read them automatically without thinking.

If you think that the idea of the movie was to ridicule what life was like in a concentration camp during WWII, think again, and watch the movie one more time 'cause you mustn't have paid attention the first time.
I see the characters portraied in this movies as heroes. The perception I got out of it was one of the highest respect (on the part of Benigni) for all those who went to great lenghts trying to survive the horrors they were put through on a daily basis, sometimes offering themselves for the ultimate sacrifice to protect each other and/or their loved ones.
The bitter smiles during the ""funny"" parts of the movie did nothing but reinforce the feeling of outrage and sadness we all feel (or should feel) when thinking of that.
It's a marvelous movie!
A celebration of life!

Granted Benigni's story is told in a different manner than other Holocaust films like ""Schindler's List"". His style is rather light hearted, and I think some are offended to see such a serious matter portrayed as such.  But the lesson learned and the emotions you feel by the end of this movie are profound, and in no way take away from the seriousness of the Holocaust.

Gladly, reading other reviews here, I see that many others did understand so I guess there is still  some hope for us all.
This is NOT a comedy!  The comedy is merely a device in the main character's personality.  He is a like-able, totally open, free spirited clown of sorts and I believe that the purpose of using a character like that is  simply to disarm the audience; you simply cannot have any malice toward this man.  That is where this film is far different than a movie like Schindler's list where you get to know the mind of Schindler but learn very little about the real personalities and thoughts of those he saves.
So, watch this movie and BE disarmed.  99% of this movie is a painting in progress; you just have to let go and wait while it is being painted before your eyes right up until the last few minutes of the film where Benigni finally reveals his intended message.

His wife voluntarily accompanies them but of course is separated at the sorting-out that occurs upon arrival at the camp. Benigni son stays with him, and he determines to make a game of the evils that surround them to keep the boy from becoming frightened and hopeless. On a whim, he turns the whole experience into a contest to win a tank, and each day tells his little boy (whom he hides at each inspection) how much closer they are to realizing their goal.

1030643,5,6305426651,"I loved this movie.  I think this movie, more than any other movie I've ever seen, showcases the resilience of the human spirit and its ability to triumph over almost any adversity.
I've read bitter criticism of this film from those who believe that it trivialized the horrors of the Holocaust.  I can't fault people for feeling the way they do and if that's what they feel, then I respect that, but I didn't see that at all.
For me, ""Life is Beautiful"" humanized the Holocaust like nothing else ever could.  For me, Roberto Benigni and his family were real (and no doubt, there were real people like them who were sent to the camps).  For me, this movie made the Holocaust seem even more important than it had been before.  It showed me that wonderful, innocent people died and that others gave their lives so the people they loved could live.  Of course, I know that from history books, but no history book I've ever read has packed the emotional punch of ""Life is Beautiful.""
Benigni's performance in this film was so perfect I can't even think of a performance that comes close.  Even Adrian Brody's beautiful performance in ""The Pianist"" wasn't the tour de force of Benigni's.  Benigni gives us a tragicomic masterpiece that I don't think can ever be equalled.  To those who did not like the comedic aspects of this film, let me just say this:  for some of us, and I am one, the comedic touches only served to heighten the ensuing tragedy.
The ending of this film left me so emotionally shattered that I haven't been able to watch the film again, even though I want to do so.  This is a beautiful film.  The script is perfect, the acting is perfect and the story is so heartbreaking in its perfection that it will live forever in my being.  I will never look at the Holocaust again in the same way, i.e., as a historical event.  Instead, I will think of the Holocaust as something that happened to individual human lives.
I treasure this film.  It's perfection and it does show me that life, even with all of its pain and tragedy, can indeed, be beautiful.",1072396800,2,2061,4.502688172043011

It received seven Oscar nominations and three rightful wins: Best Foreign Film, Best Original Score, and Best Actor(Roberto Benigni).  Its plot is brilliant.  Such chain of events rarely fit as one credible movie.  Benigni's writing brilliance makes everything fit.  Amazingly, the plot takes a severe historic tragedy and offers more hope of survival, namely Guido telling his son that this is a game of trying to win the tank.  Though nothing about The Holocaust was good, this accurately desplicts the trials of its victims.  The movie combines tragedy, magic, and love.  The acting is wonderful.  Everyone pours their heart and soul through their characters.  Their previous research about the real-life victims shines through every scene.  Such rough emotions are never held back for a second.  The set and the costume designs were manufactured wonderfully.  They accurately desplict the styles of 1939-1945.  The elaborate settings give the added magical or tragic vibe, depending on the individual scene.  ""Life Is Beautiful"" is a great movie for those looking for a unique, powerful drama.  The italian version is much better than the english version.  The english version takes away much of the intended emotion.

1030646,2,6305426651,"After skimming the reviews here, Roberto Benigni has obviously struck a chord with a lot of people.
I would not argue with them but I found myself with the reviewer who called this film MR. BEAN GOES TO AUSCHWITZ.  Actual history proved just too distracting for me to get caught up in this ""fable.""
Actually, the film I kept thinking of has never been seen: Jerry Lewis' THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED.  I've read the script and I can only imagine the reviews of that film if it was ever released!  (Now there's a film in itself: a daffy but deranged filmmaker, popping pills and performing pratfalls, producing his movie about a German clown entertaining Jewish kids on their way to the ovens.  Yikes.)
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't go that far, but I found myself constantly distracted by Benigni's rubbery slapstick taking place in a concentration camp.  Yeah, it's sweet that he wants to spare his son the horrors of the camp...but they're in a camp, a concentration camp.
The first half of the film actually plays like a whimsical, slightly-more-witty Jerry Lewis movie.  Then the Nazis arrive.  Individual scenes manage to touch and charm, but overall it just feels very odd.
Jerry Lewis must have gone nuts when Benigni won the Best Actor Academy Award (William Goldman, the sage of screenwriters, certainly did in print by saying this was the greatest Oscar abomination since THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH won Best Picture in the 1950s).  I admit I was put off at Benigni's antics at the Oscars--""I LUFF YOU, I LUFF YOU ALL, I MAKE LUFF TO YOU ALL!""  I can't even picture Jerry Lewis carrying on that much if he'd won Best Actor for THE BELLBOY.  Now that I think about it, maybe he would....
Yes, movies are a great escape from reality--but there are some realities that shouldn't be part of that escape.
We have new generations of kids coming up who are quite removed from the terrifying reality of the Holocaust and the near-slapstick version of it portrayed in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL could diminish the true horror of it.

Guido, lives in Italy and he's a remarkable man with great sense of humour. He meets his principesa by accident and soon she becomes his wife and gives birth to a very bright boy. Then the bloody Nazis show up - Guido and his son are taken away in the camps and then Guido's wife joins their fate too but she's kept seperate from them.
Guido is a very caring father to his son and from the very beginning he keeps telling him that this is only a game so he wouldn't get scared from this absurd but most of all so his son couldn't get killed by damned Nazis.
I've probably seen hundreds of movies on Jews sufferings. I must have read hundreds of books too - sad ones that would break my heart into zillion pieces but only after I've watched this movie I realised that I lacked the 100% sympathy to Jews for what they've gone through from sadistic Nazis. God damn them.
I know from my own experience that wars and racial hatred are totally wrong but it was only this movie that really taught how bad wars can really be. Just how many nice,remarkable,full of life people like Guido were killed in wars until now?!?
I wonder will they ever stop...and in case they don't I truly hope there'll be wars in which Greed,Hate,Jealousy and Fear would get massacred - not people. Only then Life would have been beautiful.",1068076800,,1459,4.367647058823529

As for the balance this film brings in (your) life you be the judge!
Roberto Benigni, as Guido, is at the top of his form and, at times, one has the feeling that he becomes the movie itself. The supporting roles (Nicoletta Braschi and Giorgio Cantarini) are nothing less than great. A FIRST, and hopefully not singular, in what may well be a new genre.",1067299200,,796,4.992481203007519

When she asks him to ""take me away,"" oh my Lord, nothing in the history of film gets any better than that sweet moment.

""Life is Beautiful"" is aptly titled. It is a testament to the beauty of the human spirit.

1030683,5,6305426651,"When Roberto Benigni burst onto the Hollywood scene with this acclaimed film and his over-the-top enthusiasm, I couldn't bring myself to watch this film.  Instead, I waited for the DVD.  However, what I perceived as hype was truly deserved.  ""Life is Beautiful"" is a wonderfully inventive tale that seems fresh even today, years after its first release.  Part slapstick, part drama, part romantic comedy, part tragedy - this story of an Italian family during the Holocaust defies categorization.
The films opens with Guido (Benigni) and his friend arriving in town on a car with no brakes and being mistaken for facist officials expected for a parade.  This slapstick scene ends with Guido catching the future love of his life, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), as she jumps from a barn window.  The clownish Guido sets out to win her heart despite the odds against him.  These early scenes set the stage for the rest of the movie:  Guido will rely on invention, humor, and persistence to protect his loved ones despite the obstacles he faces.  What begins as slapstick becomes heartbreaking later.  Like all stories of the Holocaust, this film has its grim side, but Benigni relies heavily on exaggerated humor, running gags, and an early circus-like atmosphere to set up the emotional power of the time's reality.  Most of the atrocities are implied, not witnessed, and the viewer's own knowledge of the time period creates an additional layer of tension.
Roberto Benigni is superb as Guido; his antics are hilarious, but during more dire moments, emotions flash across his face, revealing both the depth of his character and the reality of his position.  Nicoletta Braschi is also good, and little Giorgio Cantinini as Guido?s son Joshua is adorably spunky, especially as he questions his father's stories.
I always advocate watching foreign films in the original language, with subtitles, but I understand that some viewers may not like ""reading"" a movie.  In this case, however, the dubbed version was distracting, as Benigni provides the English track for his own character while American voices dub the rest of the cast.  His Italian accent amid the American accents completely broke the illusion for me.  Still, if a dubbed version is the only way you'll watch this movie, please do it.
I highly recommend ""Life is Beautiful."" Its offbeat approach remains unparalleled in the canon of Holocaust movies.  Because of the absence of explicit violence and sex, viewers as young as thirteen should admire this extraordinary film.",1062288000,162,2524,5.089805825242719

The whole movie is great, the acting couldn't of be done with anyone else. Beautifully portrayed with no cursing, or sex scenes, how rare to find such a great movie.

1030685,5,6305426651,"There are very few films you can watch in a foreign language with subtitles which will make you laugh out loud. Life is Beautiful will do so from beginning to end. Benigni is a motor-mouthed genius, the script and screen play devilishly inventive and impishly funny all the way along.
It's certainly no flat-out rib-tickler: The experiences of a Jewish Italian waiter and his family in a concentration camp could hardly be wall to wall slapstick. (Well, in Mel Brooks' capable hands, maybe - but Benigni has bigger fish to fry than Mel Brooks ever did.)
HOWEVER, I was not so taken with the Holocaust element. For one thing, the film is deliberately surreal and derives much of its humour from patently improbable situations: Benigni's character, a lovable wag, spends the entire film getting away with things which would throw any mortal into hospital, jail or a santitorium.  So there's inevitably an element of Hogan's Heroes about the Concentration Camp scenes. This is fine on the comedy level, of course, but it does undermine any more serious a points Benigni might be trying to make. And Life is Beautiful unquestionably does stoop to collect some cheap gravitas.
[Warning: Controversial View coming up:]
As an exercise in harrowing film-making, depicting the Holocaust is easy pickings. You don't need to be Spielberg or Polanksi to create an emotional wrecking-ball out of Dachau: the Nazis did that by themselves. You only have to have seen ""The World At War"" to realise that pure reportage of the Holocaust is horrifying enough without any dramatic push.
And, like it or not, Benigni does collect on this front.  I don't think that detracts from the excellence of this film - which is, after all about what a father will do for his family - but I think it considerably skews the Deep & Meaningful Index readout.
Which is to say is that Life is Beautiful is a standout piece of cinema because of its wit, not because of its treatment of the Holocaust. What's more, it's the better for that. Comedy is a much harder trick to pull off than high drama.",1058227200,2,2060,4.783707865168539

Roberto's character, Guido, is taken along with his son Giusue to Auschwitz on what happens to be Giusue's 5th birthday.  Because the boy is so young, Guido makes every effort to try to hide the real horrors of their experience from Giusue by telling him it's all a game and everyone gets points for doing things.  He then goes on to tell the boy that the first person to get 1,000 points wins the game and gets a real tank as first prize.  This helps Giusue cope to a point, because Guido has to keep the story about the game going.  The movie is a real tear-jerker, but it has lighter scenes to help it seem not so completely depressing.

1030721,3,6305426651,"La Vita e Bella (Roberto Benigni, 1997)
Roberto Benigni finally gets out from under the blanket that is Jim Jarmusch (Benigni and Jarmusch teamed for such cult classics as Down by Law and Night on Earth) in America. It should have been obvious for anyone who followed both men that Jarmusch's humor is of a decidedly different sweep than is Benigni's. After all, Benigni released the silly, rather stupid Johnny Stecchino the same year Jarmusch released Night on Earth, with Benigni as one of the cab drivers. Where Jarmusch is intellectual, Benigni is slapstick, often painfully so.
To Benigni's credit, La Vita e Bella is his best film. (By far.) He tones down the slapstick quite a bit, though he's as manic as ever. Here, he plays the kind of guy everyone knows, the inveterate liar who uses his talents for storytelling to try and make life better for everyone around him. He gets his big test during World War II; as he is Jewish, both he and his son are taken to a concentration camp, where he spends his time trying to convince his son that they're playing a game rather than trying to keep themselves alive in the face of Nazi oppression.
It's impossible not to like the film, really. But I think much of the credit should go to the supporting cast rather than Benigni, who's as annoying as ever. (At least he's not playing with bananas this time a la Johnny Stecchino.) Everyone around him, rather than seeming grateful for his actions, seems to take them with an almost resigned amusement; in other words, every other actor in the movie is set up as a straight man for Benigni and his wild flights of fantasy. The effect is wonderful.
There is much to be made of the light tone taken with the Holocaust, and the hundreds of coincidences throughout the latter half of the movie that would have made it impossible, but we must remember: this is Benigni. His character's wild flights of fantasy are nothing more than a mirror of Benigni's own wild flight of fantasy in the structure and content of the film itself. Still, the juxtaposition of manic comedy with the horrors of war (most starkly shown when Benigni gets lost in the fog after the dinner) does leave something of a bad aftertaste in the mouth.

Yet, against enormous odds and with no resources but his love for his family and his wits, he finds a way to give his family the hope they need to survive the horror of the holocaust.
The genius of this film is in juxtapositions; of comedy and tragedy, of love and terror, of heroism and cruelty. And most of all, Benigni's ability to perfectly layer carefree silliness on overwhelming desperation. This is most poignently demonstrated in his final scene as he is marched away at gunpoint and gives his hidden son a last wink and grin that is also a grimace of fear and agony, and the silly marionette march he put on for his son's benefit that sags into a despairing slump; with these bits of body language we know that he has used up everything he had in his effort to save his child; the gunshot that follows is a mere formality.

1030748,5,6305426651,"An Italian movie?  Worth watching?  If you are put off by the fact that this movie was produced in Italian, you'll miss the pleasure of seeing one of the most ""moving"" movies ever made.  And fortunately for us English-speaking folks, a version has been produced with English voices fluently dubbed over the original Italian.  You'll find that the power of this movie goes beyond languages and cultures.

The setting is Italy, prior the Second World War; the protagonist Guido is a bumbling yet charming waiter.  With his Charlie Chaplin style charm, Guido attempts to seduce the pretty schoolteacher Dora, only to find she is already engaged.  In a comic sequences of events, he courts and wins his bride.  But this first half of the movie about romance is mere background, setting the emotional stage for the rest of the movie and the horror that follows.  After their marriage and an interlude of five years, it becomes evident that Guido is a Jew.  Along with his wife and son Giosue (Joshua), he is deported to a concentration camp.

The structure reminds me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", which in a similar manner is composed of two halves, the first half developing sympathy for a character and his family, and the second half placing this character in the cauldron of fiery trials and tragedy.  There are also similarities with the movie ""Titanic"" - a man falls in love with an engaged woman based on physical attraction, and after the conquest of their love they are together they are thrown into a horrific trial with a tragic conclusion.  But ""Life is Beautiful"" has a story far more ""titanic"" in its power and passion, and unlike the Hollywood blockbuster, it is genuine love based on self sacrfice rather than immoral passions.  Whatever suggestion there is of immorality (such as Guido's declaration that he desires to make love to her on the street) is presented absurdly and for humor, and is hardly intended to be taken seriously, unlike the steamy car scene in Titanic.  The very vague suggestion that they sleep together before marriage quickly fades behind the image of marital faithfulness, the wife's selfless devotion to her husband and family, and the self-sacrificing love of a husband and father.

While the first half is very comic, the second half is very serious. Guido is desperate to protect young Joshua from the horror inflicted by the Germans, and so he pretends that the concentration camp is part of an elaborate game, with the first prize being a real tank.  He tries to keep up his son's spirits by ingeniously inventing this game, saying ""Isn't this fun?"" ""I've never had so much fun!""  ""It sure is fun!"" These repeated statements ring hollow in the middle of a concentration camp, and the illusion is hard to maintain when the boy says ""I just don't get this game"" and wants it to be over.  His father's reply ""This game is serious"" has more significance than he realizes.

The first part of the movie features many memorable scenes of comedy: the belly-button classroom speech; the couple in deep conversation on the steps, he holding a steering wheel and she holding a pillow over her behind; a passionate kiss that occurs underneath the table; the green horse Prince Charming uses to rescue his princess; Guido's ""interpreting"" of the German guard's instruction.  But as comedy turns into tragedy, there are also memorable scenes of tragedy: the old Jew offering to help up the German who trips in the gas chambers; the irony of the German doctor who can help Guido but is obsessed with his riddles: ""You have to help me!""; and the boy's final vision of his father goose-stepping between the guards.
The concluding hope (""We won! We won!"") is touched by tragedy.  By not being afraid to include sorrow, this tragic note makes the movie all the more emotional and successful.  I can think of few movies that have affected me as emotionally as this one.  Injecting a movie about the holocaust with comedy was taking a major risk, but ultimately made the movie all the more successful.  The height of comedy in the first half makes the depth of tragedy in the second half all the deeper.

The PG-13 rating is primarily because of one instance of blasphemy, and a few war scenes.  Any adult themes that are present, however are not seen, but implied off-screen, including the actual horrors of the concentration camp.  Rather than dwell on the physical horrors of war through sensationalism, this movie focuses instead on the emotional impact.  It is especially the actor Roberto Benigni that makes this succeed.  As well as being the main actor, Roberto Benigni was also the writer and director of the movie.  In the half-hour featurette that is on the DVD, he acknowledges that the biggest influence on his acting was Charlie Chaplin.  Not does his slap-stick humour provide wonderful comic relief, but also emotion.  It's a brilliant performance that deservedly won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.

But this film also took out the Academy Awards for best soundtrack - the classical music is a wonderful emotional counterpart to the storyline - and for the best foreign language film.  Over time, it has won a record of over 70 international awards.  After you watch it, you'll understand why.  It's a captivating picture of comedy and of survival and hope in the midst of horrific tragedy.  I can't think of a single movie that has ""moved"" me as this one has.  It may be Italian, but this is a movie not to be missed by people from anywhere around the world. - GODLY GADFLY",1042588800,23,5518,4.786694825765576

1030789,4,6305426651,"Guido is an Italian Jew that owns a bookstore.  He meets a gentile woman, they marry and have a son.  Then WWII breaks out and the whole family is herded off to a concentration camp.  This doesn't sound like the plot synopsis of a comedy, but this is no ordinary comedy.  It is a heartwarming affirmation of life, as Guido tries to shield his son from the horrors of the camp by making a game out of it.  Guido makes up the rules as he goes along: ""You must hide and never let the angry people [the guards] see you - we get 50 points for every day you stay hidden!""
There are many things to like about the film.  The performances are charming (Benigni won an Oscar as Guido).  The screenplay is well-constructed, in that it doesn't shy away from the reality of the holocaust (e.g., Guido's elderly uncle is dispatched in the gas chamber), but can still be sweet and funny.  In fact, the jarring effect of arriving at the concentration camp is more pronounced in this film because it's so farcical and lighthearted in the beginning.
This DVD version has clean video and audio (at least, on the Italian track - I have not listened to the dubbed version).  Unfortunately, as is typical of Mirimax, the extras on the DVD are mostly promotional materials.  For example, the Making Of featurette is essentially a half hour of sound bits from people praising the film.  Some are convincing, such as the director of the Simon Weisenthal Centre stating how the film is important for raising awareness of the Holocaust.  But where are the dissenting views?  It is well-known that Steven Spielberg hated the film because he felt it belittled the Holocaust.  Another feature is a complete (?) set of about 20 television ads, all of which are about the same, each with a different award that the film won.  What's the point of that?  There is no commentary, no deleted scenes, etc.  All-in-all, there's no reason to buy the DVD over the VHS except possibly for the choice of subtitles/language tracks.

It presents life, love, and pain together in an experience that is not just a portrait or a tale, but a treasure for the soul.  It teaches and reminds us of emotions that we don't feel often enough.  Torn between joy and sadness, the tears flow blissfully and give such a feeling of beauty that one becomes overwhelmed and falls instantly in love with this creation.
  This may seem strong or exaggerated if you've not seen this film, or if you saw it and were blinded by the blend of comedy and the holocaust.  This is a base view and if this blocked your enjoyment of the film, please hear this:  the film does not make light of the holocause or suggest that it did not cause such magnitude of pain that we cannot understand it; the film is so poignant because you experience the joy of a family filled with life and see it fight the terror.  I'm enamored by this strategy and I want to experience it again.  Though in one moment I felt such sadness and even anger, the recollection of the joy that preceded it [in the film] and the knowledge that some of that joy will live and grow, brings a perfect blend of emotion which leads me directly to a viewpoint on life that is realistic and at once optimistic, hopeful, and seeking beauty.

However, how many Schindler's Lists do we really need to see?  This movie was not intended to chronicle every injustice suffered by the Jewish people.  It is more a story of family.  As a Holocaust movie, it is mixed, but as a love story and a story of family persevering through trying times, it succeeds fully.  Benigni is hilarious and charming in the first half as he woos his future wife while happily bumbling through life.  And in the second half, he is a tragic optimist, as he shields his son from the horrors of their situation.  Although featured very little in the film, the son is really the focal point, and the whole movie is basically told through the rosy memories of the child and the stories he has heard about his father.
While some may find the white-washing of Nazi atrocities offensive, again it should be understood that this is not a movie about the Holocaust.  It is a movie about a family that happens to be set during WWII.  While not perfect, it deserves a full 5stars for Benigni's wonderful acting.",1018224000,2,1190,4.623809523809523
1030794,5,6305426651,"To think that Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" (La Vita E Bella) ""trivializes the holocaust"" misses the entire point and premise of this film.
It's not, as some seem to feel, a two part film. It's a seamless account of a man blessed with the ability to laugh at everything and not take himself nor, for that matter, anyone or anything else, very seriously. It's that trait which endears Guido (Roberto Benigni) even to Benigni's critics at the start of the film. In fact it's this gift of humor that allows him to foil a fascist school administrator, confound an imperious public official, befriend a German doctor and win the girl, played by Benigni's real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi.
As so often happens in life, just when things are looking up, the world closes in on Guido and his family. They wind up in a Nazi concentration camp, where Guido spends all of his energy trying to shield his young son from the realities of their existence. He tells him, it's all a game and that the winner gets a life sized tank to take home. The rest is a tale of a father's love that translates into self sacrifice for his son.
As he (the son/survivor) narrates at the start, ""This is a very simple story, but a difficult one to tell."" Apparently some folks miss the point.

There is intense pain in this movie, and to me it was not a comedy.  Rather it is the story of of an indominably kind,good spirit in the midst of total horror.

1030821,5,6305426651,"When I read several years ago that one of Italy's favorite comedic actors planned to make a comedy about the holocaust, I was appalled. That's what I get for believing everything I read. Life is Beautiful isn't a comedy. Director and star Roberto Benigni has taken what is, in fact, a grim subject, and, in typically Italian fashion, has infused it with a marvelous lust for life. He shows the remarkable abilities many people have to adopt to any situation and to get through it with dignity and humor. And, above all, he shows the remarkable lengths a parent will go to in order to protect a child - not just from physical harm, but from mental and spiritual harm as well.
This is a simple story full of the richest of characters. Guido [Benigni] is a young man who is always aware of the wonder of being alive. He can take the most mundane events and turn them into wondrous fantasies. He comes up with the most remarkable ideas for diffusing any bad situation. He is the hopeless romantic.
When he moves to a small town, he immediately meets the love of his life. She is Dora [Nicoletta Braschi], the school teacher daughter of a rich, snobbish woman. Guido woos her, and she is captivated by him. Her mother has arranged for her to marry an oafish town official, but Guido has a wealth of funny tricks up his sleeve that aid him in winning her. In the beginning, theirs is a storybook romance, but soon, they encounter an obstacle that even the resourceful Guido cannot overcome, though he tries mightily. Their love affair begins in 1939, when Fascist Italy is in an evil alliance with Nazi Germany. Guido is a Jew. Fate is about to play its hand.
By the time Guido and Dora's son, Giosue, is four years old, the Nazi have arrived to send Guido to a concentration camp. Guido and Giosue are arrested suddenly and placed on a train filled with other prisoners. When Dora, who is Catholic, learns of their plight, she rushes to the train station, and, in one of the most poignant scenes in movie history, she demands that the commandant put her aboard it.
How can Guido protect his child's mind from the horror that is to follow? That is the heart and soul of Life is Beautiful. Guido shows incredible ingenuity, and, for the most part, Giosue believes him. At times, he just pretends to, because Guido is so full of life, love and humor. His is an infectious personality.
The best label for Life is Beautiful is tragicomedy. You take the bitter with the sweet. You appreciate the gift of life. You do your best to see that, no matter what tragedy strikes, the young are preserved for a hopefully brighter future. All of these things are so hard to do, yet Guido makes them seem so simple.
Recently, Miramax Films went to great lengths to make a dubbed version of the movie. This is the version I reviewed. While I know subtitles are a nuisance, dubbing often robs a film of the inflections actors try so hard to put into their words. The new language can add an unintended flatness to the dialog. This problem is not so noticeable in Life is Beautiful, and it opens the movie up to the many people who otherwise might avoid it.

1030822,5,6305426651,"This visually stunning film does something quite interesting, and even refreshing, which hasn't seemed to have cropped up in cinema as of late: Benigni takes the setting of Europe in the grips of World War II, and uses the stark contrast of blind and outrageous hatred against the love and eternally solid bonds of family. This is not a film about the Holocaust, and thankfully so. Benigni does not bother to tackle questions like, ""Why?"" or ""How?"" but rather eliminates any attempts to be analytical or preachy: the viewers are left feeling redeemed, and more aware of the love they have in their lives. Far too often, movies and texts about the Holocaust seem to engage in a volley of one-upmanship, in a culture bombarded by all varieties of Holocaust literature and film, we have become almost desensitized to the true nature of the event, and even more important, the bigger picture. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't attempt to grab at our sympathy for Guido, or question motives, but is a fantastic reminder that the love, bonds, and people in our lives are the most important, and that with their love and caring, even the greatest of evil can be overcome.",1014854400,3,1156,4.785

This lovely little movie is so charming and so sweet, I don't know how anyone could dislike it. I do realize that the star, Roberto Benigni, sometimes is over the top and tends to annoy some people but that is so far from the truth involving this film. We see his character meet a beautiful woman and his attempts to woo her. When they fall in love, marry and have a child, all seems perfect---until World War II and the beginning of the Holocaust. When he is taken, along with his son, to the concentration camps, it is so touching to see the lengths he goes to, as a father, to hide the truth of their actual situation. Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for his role and the film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Both were well deserved. I highly recommend this film.",1014508800,,907,4.341176470588235
1030824,5,6305426651,"One of the best films ever made is without a doubt Roberto Benigni's ""Life is beautiful"". This talented director and comic actor, first Oscar winning for best actor non-English speaker thought of a movie about  a Jewish man called Guido who overcomes horror and pain thanks to the great and unbreakable love he has for his son. The story takes place in Mussolini's Italy during World War II, in which the German soldiers deported Jewish people of all ages into the concentration camps where they were killed in various horrible ways. The film itself is a combination of comicality, romanticism and a bit of realism, which creates a very profound story that touches the bottom of everyone's hearts. Guido, the optimist humorous man gets to know Dora in funny circumstances and both fall in love, marry and have one son. After that, the story takes a quick turn. Guido and his family were deported by German soldiers. While in the concentration camps, Guido decides to protect his child from the awaiting horrors by hiding his own fear and tiredness and keeping his humor and using his great imagination in order to convince his son that life is great, always trying to keep his son's dreams and desires awake. The idea of protecting a child's innocence is one of the most wonderful and profound ideas in the whole world, and that's what makes this story the most wonderful ever.",1014249600,6,1377,4.785714285714286

First of all - I realize this film is not a documentary and it's intent is not to portray the holocaust in an accurate way.  However, there are certain things that should not be made light of.  The movie might as well have made cancer or slavery out to be on par with a day at the amusement park.  I don't care about accuracy here, but when Robert Benigni runs around pulling any hyjink he likes to make his son laugh, he denies the danger of the setting.  And we're not just talking about any setting.  This is something that is absolutely sacred and if people don't have a problem with that, I think they need to think a little harder about it.  I think using the holocaust as a setting was a cheap trick, an easy way to move people.

Love it or hate it you will remember ""Life is Beautiful."" This is a masterpiece. The writing is superb. Every element of the story is connected masterfully. Think of the key, the horse, the hat, the riddle and the fact that Joshua does not like to take baths; each of these is used by Benigni to move the plot along.

As for those who say the movie sugarcoats the Holocaust, I think they may have some merit to their argument in that there is truly nothing funny about the Holocaust, but I do not think Benigi overlooks the horrors of Holocaust life entirely. Guido's main intent was to protect his wife and son. He was going to do anything to accomplish this goal, even the outrageous and the humorous. Yes, it is true that most children were killed immediately upon reaching the concentration camps, but if we remember that Benigni called the movie a fable, we should try to overlook this one discrepancy. A fable has at its core a moral or a lesson to convey to us. What was Benigni trying to say? Was the movie about the Holocaust? Yes it was, but it was also about sacrifice and what one man can and will do in the face of cruel and inhuman conditions. He wanted to shield Joshua from the horror around him. Guido thought that by making everything a game, Joshua had the best chance for survival. Remember the look on Guido's face when he first walked in the barracks? It was the face of horror. I felt he [Benigni] knew and understood the Holocaust. For example, Benigni depicted scenes consistent with the Holocaust. There was a ""selection"" when the prisoners first got off the train. Also, he showed women, children and the elderly being sent to the gas chambers. The scene with the doctor was another example of a ""selection."" The doctor, who was a man he shared riddles with in the first half of the movie, is another casualty of the Holocaust. He appears so overwhelmed by what he has experienced in the camp that when Guido finally sees him he has gone mad, reduced to a shell of a man babbling about unsolvable riddles.

Guido's only goal was to make sure his family survived. I have two daughters, and if I am one-half the father that Guido was to Joshua, I will think of myself as a successful parent. Guido, to me, was a hero, not a buffoon as some reviewers are apt to state.",1013212800,5,2435,4.408888888888889

His heroism in the most hostile of human tragedies makes this a film about war's human toll - for in his characterization, Benigni is our heart and soul, the conscience of the world, for he balances humor with terror and shows us that sometimes, laughter is the ONLY medicine.

The movie itself was in my opinion GREAT.  I know a lot of people are upset at the comedic portrayal of the Holocaust, but I believe that the purpose of this movie was not to make the Holocaust something to laugh at.  The movie starting off funny and light and then turning to a very heavy topic was briliant.  It showcased the title well... LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.  The ending of the movie really makes you realize how precious life really is, and seeing how Benigni's character truely treasures his family is very warming.

In fact I have yet to come across a person who has told me that he doesn't like this film.  When people watch a movie, they expect to be entertained.  Some expect to be touched, while others expect to be impressed.  'Life is beautiful' is capable of doing all that and more.
A good comedy is hard to execute, a 'tragicomedy' harder and to draw a comedy out of the darkest period of mankind is almost impossible.  Benigni begged to differ.  His mind was set on showing you that laughter is the remedy of all ills.  He would make you forget to cry without demeaning the gravity of the situation.  Only at the very end would you feel the weight of this crime against humanity.
The reason why the film works so well is because he brilliantly divided it up into two almost distinct segments.  Like a good salesman, before he makes the sale pitch, he would like to get personal with you.  For the first hour or so, he would introduce you to his family, charm you endlessly and before you have the chance to get bored, he would take you to the gutter.  By the time you are in the slaughterhouse (in this case literally), he has built up enough credibility that you no longer doubt him.  By that point, you would laugh with him and not at him.

I can well understand the reservations that many bring to this film.  It is important to note, however, that Benigni's comedy never makes light of the Holocaust itself; rather, it is the means by which the resourceful Guido (Benigni) attempts to salvage his son's innocence.  Guido is a heroic character, using the only tools at his command in a desperate situation.  When the child is not present, the film does allow us a few darker glimpses at the horror of the camps although these are admittedly few.
I believe that humor, being one of the most delightful inventions of human creativity, can be an appropriate response to the darkness that also exists in the human soul.

1030918,2,6305426651,"It has taken me months to finally come to a decision on this movie.  There is a review on this page that says it best: ""If you know a lot about WW II and the Holocaust, then the movie is hard to watch and it's hard to accept that its humor fits. But if you are new to the subject or feel rather emotionally distant from it, perhaps you can enjoy the movie as a moving inspirational story. Perhaps.""  I found this movie's lighthearted, sanitary, and comic portrayal of the Holocaust under a wall of sentimentality extremely hard to accept.  Yet, at the same time, each and every person who I know who has seen it and who is not as familiar with the Holocaust and WWII as I, has found it to be a tragic story.  For those familiar with the time period, you know that ""tragic"" is a tame and happy word when used next to ""holocaust"".  There simply are no words to adequately describe the depths of that time.  I have to conclude beyond doubt that the fact that it has won so much acclaim attests to the fact that the perspective of the Holocaust has begun to fade irretrievably from memory.  This is most distressing.
But I must say, Robert B. is great in the first half where he meets courts his wife.  And also, I confess, the scene where he's translating for the German Guard in the camp...I found myself laughing despite myself.  I love Robert B.'s humor.

He wants him to believe nothing is wrong and his antics to convince him of this fact could be construed as humourous.

1030922,2,6305426651,"About a year ago I wrote a controversial review over this movie. I decided to pull it off in the end because I realized it didn't convey my opinion correctly.
Today I want to repeat my efforts to point out the things that were wrong in this film, because I truly think someone did here something unjustified and got away with it. I know the most see it a remarkable 'human spirit victory', not me.
To begin with, it's all attached to the way you allow yourself to perceive the Holocaust.
Most recently, I've read the opinion of an Austrian Philosopher, that his beliefs raised much ado in the European academies. He has published an article that, in short, speaks about the need to percept the actuality of the Holocaust as another tragedy among many in the 20th century. He reminds us that there were more than a few like-Shoas genocide events and that one shouldn't dramatize this in particular.
He resents the sacredness people are giving to the Holocaust, and claims that it harms the greater goal of healing and evolving to a better humanity as a whole.
Why have I mentioned this ?  Because I suspect his thoughts, in a way , are given form in this film.
First of all, you'd have to agree with me that the main subject of this movie is the Holocaust(and the efforts to inclose it from the child). Moreover, it's not just a comedy - it has a purpose.
Now we can begin our journey. Half a movie is evidently almost a pure comedy. The terror that is to come is cued, very subtly. With the other half I have my problems, because here we really enter the concentration camp, and the Holocaust.
Up till now, ok, the father concealed the truth from the son -and from the rest of the viewers. But once in the camp - the comedy continues, AND, a person can get the impression that this is what it really was. I would causiously say taht you might give legitimacy to Holocaust deniers by screening this film-they will find a lot to hang on to. It's wrong to put things in this light. You see the reality of the camp through the eyes of a child ,as a game, and people might think - hell, maybe that what it really was, everything else is another pulp fiction of the Jews !
I feel that this movie help those who are responsible, or feel responsible to polish their conscience. How? By pretending it wasn't that bad, not to say it wasn't at all. Recall this scene: after the supper with the Germans, the father takes his son to their quarters. There is mist all around, and everything is foggy - and exactly then he witnesses for the first and last time a stack of dead bodies ,apparently Jews, the only innuendo in the film for what is really going on . He fortunately succeeds in preventing his son from seeing. The wrong is the whole atmosphere which allude us this was all a dream,a Nightmare - the dead pile wasn't real!

Look, I didn't spend watching the movie searching for things like that, but it just popped up and really bothered me - and there are more examples like that .
I admit, an article I'd read before I saw the movie influenced me. But aren't we all ?
We criticize things all the time - so why regard a `non harmful' comedy, when it is about the Shoa, as it is? I looked deeper and found disturbing messages all over the film that I feel shouldn't be ignored. That's why it was important for me to express it, even though most folks disagree.  Do not take the film as innocent as it appears! This 'comedy' had a purpose, and it wasn't just to entertain us.
Getting back to the Philosopher I started with, this film is the first I know ,that allows itself to look in another glasses over the ,up to this point, a somber ,terrible and serious tragedy. 'All the sudden' it is fine not to dramatize the whole concept . We can start talking now with the `take it easy' terms. It's not a major disgraceful point in the humanity evolution anymore, like it can be interpreted from the opinion of the Philosopher.
I hope reading this clarified your understanding of my resentment from the movie,though you may still wouldn't agree with me...",1000339200,10,4045,4.397863818424566
1030923,4,6305426651,"Roberto Benigni's celebrated affirmation of the human spirit owes a little to ""Rhinoceros,"" Ionesco's absurdist play from the Sixties.  There's the same attempt to reduce the worse horror in human history to the absurd.  Perhaps this is a way of comprehending something monstrous beyond comprehension.  Benigni was criticized in some circles for trivializing the Holocaust, but that is not what he did.  He sought to rise above it.  I don't know whether he or Ionesco were really successful.  On the other hand has anybody-any religion, philosophy or great artist-ever solved the problem of evil in this world?
There's something of Charlie Chaplin in Benigni's irrepressible hero, and in the camera work look for the influence of Orson Wells in light and shadow.  The strange splashes of color on such places as the concentration camps walls reminded me curiously of Jacque Demy's ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" a wondrous French operetta from the Sixties (starring Catherine Deneuve, music by Michel Legrand).
The movie is a little slow at times and we miss a lot of Benigni's mugging as our eyes chase after the subtitles (get the dubbed version), but the central idea, that with our attitudes we create the world, and that life can be beautiful even in the midst of tragedy, is uplifting, if hard to believe.",999216000,,1306,5.046511627906977
1030924,5,6305426651,"This is one of the best and most creative films ever made. Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams, his ""Principessa"", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.

Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.

In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.

While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.

1030925,3,6305426651,"This is the only Roberto Benigni picture I did not enjoy. Some subjects are just not funny. To me, Holocaust is one of these subjects. Slapstick and clowning around do not belong here. I am sorry to be so categorical, because I like Benigni's work very much, and generally, his movies are both art and entertainment of the highest class. I think I know what he was trying to do here, and he achieved it. But emotionally I cannot accept this product. This movie has a very different feel than the much lighter ""Johnny Stecchino"" and ""The Monster"" (two of his other big hits in America). That is to say, the movie does not leave you feeling that you have just seen a wild, light comedy, but instead, leaves you feeling that you have had a trying experience and know what it's like to confront real evil. This was almost certainly intentional and the only appropriate way to go, but then we are back to the argument that the comedic elements just do not ""belong."" .... But here you have a death camp and genocidal Germans--a ""truly different race"" as one character calls them in admiration. By the way, it is typical of Benigni's approach to drop this kind of ""hints"" to make his statements--he almost never generalizes in a direct fashion. The mere presence of his puzzle-obssessed German doctor, who is entirely incapable of empathy, says more about the single-minded, cold-blooded determination of the Nazis than entire volumes of verbal propaganda ever could.
The acting in ""Life is Beautiful"" is of the highest quality. Benigni again engages his real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi as his co-star and on screen love interest who eventually marries him. Braschi's character, Dora, who is not Jewish, nevertheless follows her husband and son to the camp, when the invading Germans spread their genocidal policy to Italy. This is where the second part of the movie takes place. If you know a lot about WW II and the Holocaust, then the movie is hard to watch and it's hard to accept that its humor fits. But if you are new to the subject or feel rather emotionally distant from it, perhaps you can enjoy the movie as a moving inspirational story. Perhaps.",998179200,3,2151,4.723404255319149

Life is Beautiful is a brilliant piece of work that gets better each time I see it and, as if you couldn't guess, I recommend it highly to anyone who hasn't yet.
Now, the DVD is another issue altogether.  The movie looks pretty good and sounds good.  The disk is sufficient in those aspects.  However, for those of you who love extras, they are severly lacking here.  The ""making of"" featurette has very little to do with the filming but more to do with the attention the movie has received worldwide.  I have seen better documentaries about the movie elsewhere and would have preferred to have one of those included.  You get a theatrical trailer and a string of TV spots that all look the same.

It would have been easy for this odd and daring approach not to work, but director, co-author and star Roberto Benigni has created one of the most touching films ever made. To appreciate this film fully, you should be aware of a film Jerry Lewis made in 1972, The Day the Clown Cried, ridiculed by critics and public alike (although it's never been seen by any of them). It's based on a similar premise, but it's locked in Lewis's vault, unreleased. Life is Beautiful is testament that Lewis's unseen and prematurely shunned film is a legitimate premise and could well be a great movie, as far as anybody knows. But until the day may come that Lewis decides to share his film with us, you won't do better than the flawless mastery that is Life is Beautiful.",997142400,,1001,4.475409836065574

This subject has been the theme of many movies for many years. We can't see a different approached in this one. The things the father does for his son are not extraordinary. Every father can do the same things for his son. In my opinion Roberto Benigni as the director and performing the leading role stands out.
  He was very successful in making people smile and create a comedy and joy for life in spite of such gruesome conditions. Benigni has proved that an ordinary theme can be transformed into a successful movie by bringing an epic tale of love and the human spirit to the screen.

If you dislike Holocaust movies per se, still see this movie. This is a story about living life and loving.  Guido is the epitome of a true man.  He is a little goofy, but endearing.  At first I put up with his antics, but as the movie progressed, Benigni (Guido) had me wishing I was his princepessa.  He loved Dora with a passion that I've rarely seen in life.  He consistently refused to live life at a low level, no matter what the circumstance.  He refused to bow to any circumstance or public opinion that made him feel less than a prince.  Principe Guido!
He seemed to glide through life with his wit and optimism.  He refused to be offended by racism, and protected his loved ones by making light of racist attacks.  His humor and creativity shielded his son through the concentration camp experience, all the way to the end.  He was a winner...an overcomer.  He gave this great gift of winning to his son, whose innocence was intact to the end.
You start out the movie thinking Guido's a goofball, and end up realizing that he is a man among men.  That is the charm of the movie, that you become attached to them as though you know them.
This movie is about a horrible event, but will make your spirit soar.  Every line and every scene of the movie is important, so pay attention.  Listen to the Italian spoken as you read the subtitles.  It is part of the beauty of the movie.

1031049,5,6305426651,"So there I was, looking for a video to rent and this one had a lame title but promised a powerful ending. I rented it. The beginning was almost like a comedy; this realistic-looking (i.e. not a Hollywoodized version of a Jewish person) Jewish fellow was very lighthearted as he creatively courts a very beautiful woman, the kind you're thinking, ""This guy? THAT woman? Yeah right, as if THAT could ever happen..."" The movie continues; the family winds up in a Nazi Prison Camp but again, the Jewish fellow uses his creativity and wits to keep his young son from knowing the truth by creating an elaborate story about how they're actually in this place willingly, because it's a GAME and they have to play it correctly so they can win first place.
The ending - oh god the ending will just blow you away. The review on the back of the video box sure wasn't kidding about THAT part.
This movie did far more than ""Schindler's List"" ever did for me to understand and be moved by what happened to all those families in NAZI Germany -- I felt like I KNEW the psyche of this Jewish fellow, far more than anyone ever gotten inside Schindler's head, anyhow. In fact, I realize I'm still carrying this skinny little Jewish fellow around in my head; that's probably what prompted me to actually write this review...it's been almost two months since I rented the video, and now I'm here to buy it.

Benigni's performance is immediately captivating and the story of his life in fascist Itlay before the war is lighthearted and quite enjoyable.  Then the Nazis take over his portion of Italy and Guido and his son end up in a concentration camp.  Despite this development, however, the movie's lighthearted tone doesn't change.  In fact, Guido shelters his son from the cold reality of what is going on around them.  This, of course, is utterly implausible and is the biggest flaw in the film.  Though the horrors of the Holocaust are by no means ignored, the unreality of the camp scenes make it difficult to figure out how one is supposed to react to the film.  Ultimately, the film is worthwhile to see Benigni's almost magical performance.

Yet, somehow, this man did. And the reason I feel that it was like that is because it was a relatively short stay. I don't think he could have pulled it off if it were longer.

The second half of the movie, yes, requires you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but so does Shakespeare.  The plot was seamless, well written, and wonderfully acted.  I would suggest to anyone who thinks it was below par to try writing or acting their own, and do it better than this.

1031055,5,6305426651,"This Italian movie is an extraordinarily powerful film that will haunt me for a long time.  Its about life.  Its about love.  Its about the holocaust.
The story opens in 1939 and the first half is a rollicking comedy of how Guido (played brilliantly by Robert Bernigni) woos and wins his wife.  He is a natural clown and his gift is quick thinking, fantastic timing, and outrageous acts.  He's lovable and optimistic and full of energy and life. However, he is Jewish at a time when Jews are being sent to death camps and he and his 5 year old son are rounded up.  His wife insists on following and she is sent to the women's part of the camp.  Guido wants to protect his son from the horrors of the camp and so, in his special inventive way, he spontaneously makes up elaborate inventive stories that are masterpieces of creativity.  The audience smiles through their tears as again and again Guido saves his son and gets messages of hope through to his wife, using his gift for comedy and natural joy for life in spite of the most gruesome of conditions.
I laughed, I cried and sat at the edge of my seat as I watched this video which is a celebration of the human spirit in the worst kind of circumstances.  The acting is fantastic, the direction great and the plot moves with the speed of light bringing the audience though an emotional roller coaster.  This is a serious film with an important theme and is extremely painful film to watch.  However, I have nothing but the highest praise for the filmmakers who dared to bring this epic tale of love and the human spirit to the screen.  The rewards of being willing to experience this video is a deepened appreciation for life and a unique prism through which to view the world. Highly recommended for those who can bare it.",991440000,7,1778,4.470588235294118
1031056,4,6305426651,"""We won!""  Those are the words that many Jewish survivors exclaimed at the end of one of the most horrendous acts of history, the holocaust.  People were taken from their homes to live in camps that punished them for following a certain religion.  Families were separated, lives were taken, and this horrific atrocity left an appalling impression on those survivors.  The Italian masterpiece, Life is Beautiful, captivates the contemporary generation with a vivid picture of the holocaust.  While the event is tragic, the movie's tale contains a touch of humor from the view of a terrified father who sacrifices everything in order to save his young son's life.  As time has progressed, the generations have forgotten the events that transpired in the past.  Most schools do not extensively touch upon the tragedy and the hardships that the Jews overcame through the holocaust.  I never understood what really happened, and the damage it caused over the entire world.  By watching this movie, I was able to see the affect it had on someone who experienced the torture.  Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a Jewish waiter who marries the woman of his dreams, Dora.  They fall madly in love and have a son who is their most precious possession.  The family becomes separated when they are taken to a concentration camp in Italy.  The story had such an impact on me, that now i understand completely how parents could sacrifice everything to save the one's they love.  Guido lies to his son, Joshua, about the holocaust because he wants to protect him from the emotional baggage that stemmed from being in the concentration camp.  He tells his son that the holocaust is all a big game, which makes the movie have a humorous touch to it.  The person who attains one thousand points will be the winner and receive a huge reward, a real tank.  This is what Joshua is striving for throughout the entire holocaust, while his father is risking his own life in order to keep his son from discovering the truth.  This movie shows how much a child means to a parent.  During the holocaust, children were put into gas chambers, and the parents had to live with the sorrow of their death.  I can understand why a father would do everything in his power to give his child protection, reassurance, and strength.  Even though there is a humoristic side, the movie also portrays the tragic side of the event.  It is hard to watch a family be torn apart and live each day wondering if each member is still alive.  The Jews are stripped of their privacy and rights to live a healthy and normal life.  They are forced to do extensive work with little to eat, and if they refuse, death is the only option.  It was horrendous to watch everyone be treated so violently and without compassion.  Family loyalty, trying to remain happy, and losing hope were all aspects of the holocaust.  Life is Beautiful wraps all of those things into one film that intrigues the contemporary generation.  It does no just inform the audience of the historical accuracy but also gives a personal experience of a family struggling to survive the holocaust.  I never knew how tragic this experience was, but now after witnessing it in the film, I will never forget the emotion and the trauma, which it caused in so many peoples' lives.  Through his father's loving deceit, Joshua does not have to face the harsh reality of the constant struggle for religious freedom that plagued the Jewish community.  Guido shows how the strength of family can overcome the prejudices of society.  Even though the Jews endured numerous hardships and obstacles, the victims of the holocaust can now truly say, ""We won!""",988588800,11,3653,4.767515923566879

THE ENGLISH DUBBED VOICES ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD. It may be hard for some to get used to the subtitles and reading and listening to Italian while at the same time trying to follow the movie visually, but that's only for the first 15 minutes of the movie. After that, you'll be so used to them, sometimes the chracters will seem to be speaking English (Well figuratively speaking anyway).
With that out of the way, ... The movie itself comes highly recommended for a good laugh and/or cry. Why this film wasn't the winner of ""Best Picture"" is beyond my comprehension.

And how many movies can you recolect that bring all of these elements together into one incredible mosaic.  These elements all swirl together, but not so that the various mood swings come as a shock, nor do these emotions switch at such a rate that anyone could miss something.
Some say the first story line is too fairy-tale like, and unbelievable.  Ridiculous.  There are no magic wands, no fairy god mothers.  All of it happens because one man is willing to take a chance and try to win the girl of his dreams.  Same thing happens every day, anyone who can't accept that, I pity you.
Yes, this is a comedy about the holocaust.  If someone had told me that before I had seen it, I would have cast this film aside, never to view it.  But they actually pulled it off.  Benigni mixes in fear, hope and humor at the perfect times, thus creating a fresh, yet still powerful and memorable representaion of the holocaust.

Roberto Benigni won the best actor Oscar and best foreign film Oscar several years ago for this love story turned semi-tragic. Set during World War II, Benigni and his family are sent to a concentration camp. No need to probe the details of that. It is obvious what happens then. What is unique, though, is how Benigni manages to comfort his child and keep him from being scared by convincing him that the whole camp is a game.

The characters weren't backdrops to the story of the Holocaust, but rather the situation they were in simply emphasized the beauty within the main characters.
The lives of the characters were terribly affected by the Holocaust, of course, but the experience of the Holocaust did not MAKE the characters. It demonstrated their wonderful integrity, particularly in the characters played by Begninni and Braschi.
It is a refreshing look at the horrible experience of the Holocaust -- from the viewpoint of a person who DOES maintain his integrity and refuses to be beaten down, even to the moment of death. It was a story of the spirit winning over all attempts to destroy it.
I think it's important to not forget what happened, but the way this movie was put together was uplifting, too.
I don't normally watch movies that deal with real tragic material, because it can be just too upsetting to me, especially when children are involved.

Do not be deceived by reviews that say this film is a comedy/drama. This film is very dramatic and serious. The comedic touches come in when Benigni's character does everything in his power to shield his young son from the horrid situation around them.

Roberto Benigni is flawless in his acting and direction here. The story told is one of beauty and hope amid misery and pain. For bumbling waiter Guido, every day is like a box of joy yet to be opened. He wins his girl with his irrepressible optimism and their family is complete with a little boy. But not happily ever after, because the Nazis have a different idea for Jewish people.
Guido's family must relocate to a concentration camp. Once there, he carries on an elaborate deception for his little boy, pretending the entire episode is a game they must win. Benigni does play on our emotions, but in a gentle way that never feels like manipulation. He lets us feel the characters' joy, fear, humor, and pain so subtly, you feel as if a story is being told to you, not watching a movie.

Benigni's character is an Italian-Jew, and he is sent to a Concentration Camp with his son. His wife decides that she will go to the camp too, even though she is not pure jew and does not have to. Benigni turns the whole Concentration Camp into a game, to insure that his son, Joshua, will survive and will not know the truth about the Nazis making them work. Everyday, Benigni hides Joshua in his bunk so he does't have a risk of being killed in a gas chamber.

1031157,5,6305426651,"I've been reading a few of these reviews, and quite frankly, I've been disappointed with those who despise this wonderful and wholesome film.  I think the fact that this film is considered somewhat of a controversy is a misconception -- this is one of the most beautiful and fulfilling films I have ever experienced.
I guess some people label this as comedy, but I don't see it as so.  Yes, there are moments where you laugh, but this is hardly a piece that can be taken lightly.  Perhaps Benigni shouldn't have used the Holocaust as a background for his story as that has seemed to offend many viewers, people who believe that it does not do the horrible historical event justice.  Being that I am not (Jewish) I cannot know the extent of this offense...However, I don't believe Benigni's intention was to dishonor the event in any way.  Furthermore, this movie is fiction, and is NOT, and has never claimed to be, a movie based on the events of the Holocaust.
This film is not about the Holocaust.  It is about a beautiful and loving family in adverse times, and the sacrifices parents are willing to make to maintain the innocent mind of their beloved child.  This film is an expression of humanity, and survival.
Some people I've spoken with expressed their disgust for the film's title, since the ending's tragedy does not seem to fit the meaning of the title.  I disagree.  The laughter and tears are an equal summation of the title - the beauty of the tragedy is the love that lives on, and that is passed down from one generation to the next.  Life is full of ups and downs, and without the downs, we would never know the real extent of our happiness.",973555200,4,1659,4.5369127516778525
1031158,5,6305426651,"Some say that it is hard to make a funny movie about the Holocaust.  I must admit, some of the scenes were very funny in this film. I found, however, that, once they got to the Nazi concentration camp, even those things that were funny I could only see through a haze of intense sadness.  And I think that was the intent of the film.  Some of the funny scenes I coul dnot laught at.
Benigni is able to weave light through the dark pattern of the Holocaust horror.  And he does this showing the deep love of a father for his son, a love that is unconditional, even to death.  It is not a movie about laughing about the Holocaust, it is about laughing in the face of evil, because no matter what they take from you, they can never take away love.
For those who question that comedy can be made on this subject, may I say that I have never wept so deeply after watching a movie.  It affected me even more than Schindler's List because it was more subtle, and in so being, went deeper.",972950400,2,981,4.164021164021164

Instead, all I saw was him literally trying to make a big joke out the experience, I think because Benigni isn't capable of portraying fear while being a clown.  Especially awful was the ""funny interpretator"" shtick for the Nazis.  It was just so icky to me.  I was shocked that he won Best Actor, though of course that is consistent with the travesty of the Oscars.  It wasn't a true story, but at the end the boy claims ""This is the story of my life"" as if this were true life story.  It was a cheap trick.  Very dishonest.",972604800,22,730,4.395522388059701

This movie left me speechless. I expected  a film that focused on the concentration camps and persecution of Jews.  Yes, I did get that, but I also got a beautiful love story and an  unforgettable tale of the power of imagination and a father's love for his  son.

Taking place  throughout the second world war, this movie starts off as a boy meets girl  hilarious comedy, but turns into a terrifying drama about a father  protecting his boy when they are sent to a concentration camp.

It  took me several hours to even speak- literally even speak- after seeing it  with friends of mine who bawled uncontrollably throught 90% of this epic.  It was days before I could even tell people that I saw it.
I have seen  CITIZEN KANE; I have seen CASABLANCA; I have seen E.T.; ALL ABOUT EVE; THE  GODFATHER; APOCAPSYE NOW; Olivier's OTHELLO; IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE; and so  on, and so on... this is the greatest movie I have ever seen; bar none.  I  never knew the love a father has for his wife and son could be portrayed so  incredibly, in the context of prevailing against the ultimate evil and  madness.  It's European way of refusing to tell you how to feel, but  allowing you to witness the uncontrollable flood of your own emotions as  you bare witness to that which is most frightening and most beautiful in  being human just has to be seen to be understood- there are no superlatives  I can think of that could do it justice.
This movie has changed me,  and changed the way I see the entire art form of cinema- its value to  society, and the possibility of its capacity to reveal truth.
I have  not seen the dubbed version, and I would suggest to any who have not seen  this in the theatres to find the version with English subtitles.  Dubbbed  films, in sacrificing so much in the translation, tend to muffle the soul  of the actors' perfomance; to big a price to pay, I believe, for the  convenience of not having to look down and read while looking up and  experiencing this in its purest, most complete sense.

I watched  this movie without knowing what it was about (I didn't want to know first)  and was completely surprised with the holocost theme.  While the holocost  itself was really a secondary part of the film, I was glad it showed simply  one family's experience because when we experience life, we never see the  whole picture, but rather what is happening to us at that moment in time.

1031207,3,6305426651,"Hundreds of reviews? What's all the fuss about? This is very much a film of two halves. The first half is a classic slapstick romance, the second half, a black comedy. These two link together, but the change of pace is  jarring and is signalled by the arrival of the main characters at a  concentration camp. I wondered how it could be possible to make a comedy of  the holocaust, and now I know - depict a fantasy rather than reality. The  film is 'unrealistic' in the extreme, but this only partly detracts from  the main message, that life and love are stronger than fear and death. I'm  not a person who laughs out loud at slapstick - and here yet another egg in  the hat routine bores me. But despite the sometimes formulaic pratfalls  this film has some comedic moments that are truly inspired. Benigni's  arrival at the town school to explain and inadvertantly debunk racial  superiority, for instance, or his impromptu 'translation' of the rules of  the concentration camp, are simultaneously hilarious and poignant. If  you're looking for a film about the holocaust, this isn't it. But if you're  looking for a great sentimental comedy with some fine moments, this is one  for you. If you've already seen it and loved it, try 'Il Postino' (The  Postman). Its better.",964396800,7,1275,4.705882352941177

Suffice to say it is a gentle, funny, spiritually inspiring  film and you must see it. Roberto Benigni deserved all the accolades he got  for this.

1031251,3,6305426651,"""Life is Beautiful"" is a superb film in many ways. Roberto Benigni is a brilliant comic actor and is certainly at the top of his game in this movie. Some scenes such as his impersonation of the fascist lecturer in the  Italian primary school are outstanding. In this scene, Benigni has posed as  the lecturer in order to get close to the teacher he is in love with.  Unfortunately before Benigni can approach her, he is asked to give the  students a lecture on Aryan racial superiority. So in a moment of genius  the swarthy, dark-haired Benigni strips down to his boxer shorts and  demonstrates his ""perfect Aryan features"".
While I enjoyed the comic  genius of the film, I was deeply disturbed by its fictitious, understated  portrayal of the Nazi death camp. Anyone who has encountered documentary  footage and source material from the holocaust can see staggering contrasts  between the fictional death camp in ""Life is Beautiful"" and the real thing.  For example, real death camp prisoners would never have been as healthy  looking and well fed when disembarking from the cattle cars as the ones in  ""Life is Beautiful"". They would have been greeted with beatings, killings  and an instant sense of what the place was all about. If the child, Joshua  had survived for more than a few hours (which was almost impossible) he  would have been under no illusion about what kind of place he was in. If  you don't believe me then read the accounts of Elie Weisel and other  youthful survivors of the death camp. What life people clung to in such  places was brutal. The horror was so total and so pervasive that even a  genius like Roberto Benigni would never have successfully convinced his son  that the whole thing was a game.
Does this make ""Life is Beautiful"" a bad  movie? Well, it does and it doesn't. The dramatic quality of the film is  superb. Unfortunately, the only way the film was able to float its main  premise-that a loving father could fool his son into thinking that a deadly  situation was just a game-was to tone down the holocaust. This is a  terribly irresponsible thing to do for the sake of dramatic quality. There  are only a few things in life are too staggering and too important to be  molded into comic material, but genocide is certainly one of them.",963446400,7,2280,4.660804020100502

1031255,5,6305426651,"Let me start by saying that I usually don't like heavily-hyped movies. They are usually just that- all hype. Usually they have so much hype because they don't have a story. This movie was exactly the opposite- it  had hype becaause it had a great story. I am an avid movie goer. I don't  believe in hype. Usually the best movies are the ones no one has ever heard  of. This movie everyone has heard of, and for a good reason too. This movie  was about one thing and one thing alone- love. Whether it be love for his  wife, love for his son, or love for life itself, that is the one theme this  movie plays on. The first part of this movie was about Roberto Benigni's  character, Guido, trying to win the heart of a ""princess"" whom he  met in a chance encounter. It was actually only an introduction to the  character of Guido, only to show why he would do what he did later in the  movie. This part of the movie had a happy ending- he got the girl. The  scene then immediately cuts to several years later during the time of the  halocaust, the most painful and evil time of the twentieth century. Guido  and his family are captured and sent to a concentration camp, only his son  doesn't know what's going on. In order to prevent him from facing the harsh  reality, Guido tells him that it's all a game, all of which he had planned  out. I truly have to argue with the people who claim that this movie made  light of the halocaust. It truly didn't. This was a concentration camp  through the eyes of a child, one whose father was trying to hide the world  from. This is truly where the movie gets touching. I will not reveal any  more of the movie, you'll have to see it for yourself. But the storyline  was only one thing that made this movie as credible as it is. If it didn't  have Roberto Benigni as its director and main character, I highly doubt  this movie would even be half as good. Benigni is a genius, that's all  there has to be said. He knows how to make a person laugh, and he knows how  to make a person cry. When I first heard that he was ""the next  Chaplin"", I highly doubted it. After seeing the movie, though, I have  to say that I somewhat agree. Benigni isn't a pantamimist, but he does have  the same amount of energy and movement that Chaplin had. You have to laugh  out loud at his gags. These gags are the ones no one else could sell half  as well. But he was not only movement, but he acted very well in voice,  too. He made himself a truly believable character, even though he did very  unbelievable things. This movie was  not about the horrors of the  halocaust. See a different movie if you want to see that.

By the time the first half was up I felt like it  was the happiest film I had ever seen.  Then came the dreadful second half  which takes place in a Nazi death camp.  Sure there is some extremely dark  humor in this last half but it reaked of ""Shindler's List"" and  the conclusion is not exactly uplifting either.

1031279,5,6305426651,"The Holocaust has been a point of interest for me since my brief residency in Germany as a child in the late 50's, and I've read many books on the topic, basically trying to understand the meaning of life, and deal with  the knowledge that people can be so cruel to each other. 
Still, for  months, I'd avoided watching this movie. No doubt that reveals a bit too  much about me - I've always been one to cover my eyes at scary scenes in  movies (there's a scene in Dancing with Wolves that I never have seen and  don't intend to). I've never made it through the movie version of  Shindler's List, though I'd read the book - perhaps I don't need to watch  that one. This movie is quite different than Shindler's List, although it  teaches the same history.
Watching the trailers for this movie made me  think it could not possibly be for me.  The idea of a child in a  concentration camp seemed the ultimate horror. How could such a movie be as  wonderful as reviewers were saying?  Eventually, through recommendations  from friends, I rented it, comforted by the knowledge that I could always  fast-forward it if it got too awful to watch.
I didn't fast-forward over  this movie, but fell in love with the lead character and stuck with him to  the end.  Roberto Benigni makes you love Guido, and that love for him (and  his own love for his young son) draws you into this story that is based on  so many incredible stories of that time and place.
On the surface, Guido  is a buffoon, a slapstick goofball, who falls in love with a beautiful  woman. His goofiness his really an expression of his love of life, his  humor, his willingness to take incredibly wild changes. These are the very  traits that win him the love of this woman, in an incredible scene as she  almost marries the wrong guy. These skills are what allows him to save his  son's life, and his son's sanity, during their stay together in a  concentration camp.
This is a treasure, not to be viewed just once, but  to be owned and watched again and again.  Give a gift to yourself and  friends, too.(In my opinion, it needs to be sub-titled, because the  photography and the facial expressions of Benigni should not be missed for  a second.)
  While writing a review of Elie Wiesel's book,  ""Night"", I decided to cross-reference this move - evidently it is  on the reading list for some high schools in their diversity programs. Book  reviews posted on here by high school seniors made me realize that Wiesel's  book needed to be accompanied by a movie that will make the connection that  the written word can't do for those who are blissfully unaware, if only by  their fortunate lack of experience yet with life.",961027200,20,2681,4.502083333333333
1031280,4,6305426651,"""Life is Beautiful"" is a pleasant return to movies that express emotion well. This story isn't quite your average WWII hideout plot, though.
In this movie, Roberto Benigni, who plays a funny, romantic  father and husband, must cope with the effects of World War II, which has  changed his life forever. The movie, however, does not start out darkly- it  begins with Benigni romantically persuing a beautiful and kind woman, whom  he has fallen in love with. Benigni is very funny, and does wonders with  this role. His character uses wit and humor to gain the affection of his  object of affection, played by Nicoletta Braschi. Soon they start a family:  the two of them, with their young, innocent son.
This is where things  take a turn for the worse. The War begins, and Benigni and his son are sent  off to a Nazi prison camp, where Jews and other people are being enslaved  and killed. Faced with having to explain this to his son, he turns the  entire situation into a pretend game, so as not to frighten his son. From  here things worsen- but throughout it all, Benigni tries to keep his son  happy, refusing to give up on life.
This movie, while very tragic, is  also uplifting. It give us a better sense of the value of life when we  watch it, and it amuses us at the same time. If you enjoy movies that are  funny, romantic, and uplifting, this one is definitely for you.",960854400,24,1380,4.481927710843373
1031281,5,6305426651,"I hadn't heard of this film before I saw it (okay, I know I was in a minority of one but I'd been abroad!). When a friend suggested that we see a movie, I wanted to see Schwarzenegger in ""End of Days"", but my friends  wife had already bought tickets to see ""Life is Beautiful"" (LIB). When I  asked what it was about, I was told something like ""It's an Italian Black  and White movie, with English subtitles, about a Jewish man in a  concentration camp"". I can't begin to tell you how much I DIDN'T want to  see this film. Two hours later, I emerged from the cinema with a warm glow,  having been put through a gamut of emotions, thanking my lucky stars that  my friend had got to the kiosk ahead of me.
LIB is an odd film; how on  earth can you marry a subject that evokes such compassion and outrage as  the holocaust with what is essentially a comedic love story? But LIB comes  through in spades. The film is basically divided into two acts. The first  introduces the hero as an eccentric, jocular guy, out to enjoy the life God  has given him in every way, and the escapades that lead him to meet and  marry his future wife. The comedy here owes much to the visual, vaudeville  style and works superbly well, given that scripted jokes sometimes fail  horribly when translated into another language. The second act is  understandably very much darker, when our hero, son and ultimately wife are  arrested for no apparent reason other than being alive. Even here, however,  Roberto Benigni manages to introduce humour (notably the ""Instructions""  scene, when he `translates' the Camps Rules and Regulations, as announced  by the Camp Guard in German, into Italian for the benefit of his son,  despite not speaking a word of German) albeit above a veneer of  desperation. It is reasonably hard to depict the depth of love a parent has  for their child (and spouse), but LIB comes as close as I've ever seen on  film.
Without giving TOO much away, Benigni chose wisely with his ending;  it would have been all too easy to give us a traditionally happy ending.  For me, the conclusion was STILL a happy ending - the hero achieved what he  had set out to achieve, and is rightly called a Hero.
As far as the  subtitles are concerned, you really won't notice them after the first ten  minutes, and this comes from somebody who LOATHES subtitles.
Possibly,  the DVD version loses something from the sheer scale of the cinema release,  but then so does every other film.
This is a film that I would NEVER have  CHOSEN to watch - the film simply didn't sound like a fun way to spend two  hours; I wanted to watch Schwarzenegger rip a few bad guys apart. Having  spent two hours entranced by it, I'm sorry Arnie, but LIB just blows you  out of the water!",960854400,,2747,4.447791164658635

1031283,4,6305426651,"Since American Beauty hasn't been released to home video at the time of  this review, I thought I might mention it as a means to review Life is  Beautiful. You see, in this film, Roberto Begninni walks that fine line  between the exploitation of a tragedy (the Holocaust), and making a  comedic, touching movie. This is something that movies like American  Beauty,Forrest Gump, and Primary Colors, failed to do. They all took human  tragedies and tried to be clever with them (patricide,mental & physical  disabilities and corruption respectively),unsuccessfully. Life is Beautiful  takes as important a subject, if not more so, and makes an incredibly  entertaining, and never demeaning film. The way that the father protects  his son from not only the German hostilities, but the mental anguish of the  holocaust by creating a game is a stroke of genius! It is also a touching  story of true love that cannot be separated, and a friends betrayal. Is  there a sadder moment in cinema than when Begninni is approached by an old  friend, now a German officer, who thinks is about to help his family escape  the concentration camp in whic they are imprisoned, but instead only wants  answers to a puzzle? (long stroy, rent the film!)Even the climax, when the  Americans liberate the camp and Begninni's character is killed, you never  see his death, you only hear the shot! Beautiful!

I guess my major reason for disliking this film was as a consequence of Benigni being both the egotistical  director & star. He certainly gave himself centre stage. While his  screen & real life wife was obsequiously adoring & dippy, & his  screen son was just a mail-order doll for pathos. Roberto was a totally  foolish character, who was unable to raise any empathy with me. We don't  actually get to see who shoots Roberto - but I would be more than happy to  admit to pulling the trigger.
The fact that this farce was set during the  infamous holocaust was not a problem for me - but clearly offensive to some  people. I suspect that people who cried during this film, would also have  cried during ""Pretty Woman"". As both films make a fairytale out  of a harsh reality.",959299200,27,879,4.471698113207547

1031339,5,6305426651,"Few people believed it would be possible to make a comedy set in the Nazi concentration camps of WWII. But in Life is Beautiful (aka: La Vita  bella), Roberto Benigni had a vision of one possible way to tell this tale  of horror without dehumanising the lead characters. In fact, the whole film  is full of contradictions and surprises.

There are two clear  stages in the film. The first half concentrates on Guido Orefice's efforts  to woo his chosen lady. He is funny, courageous and irrepressible in his  attempts to win the heart and hand of the lovely Dora.  Cunning strategies  are used, that take advantage of all the quirks of Florence and its people  to impress the woman he constantly greets with, ""Buono giorno  Principessa"", (Good day Princess).

From early on, there is an  undercurrent of anti-Semitism that casts a cloud over our anticipation of  things to come. But for Guido, racism is simply another of life's  obstacles; all he does is dodge around them in his pursuit of life. Pre-war  Italy still manages to seem magical through his eyes and his attitude  becomes infectious. We soon come to believe, along with Guido, that  anything is possible and if you assume the best will happen, it probably  will.

Dora's situation does not start out quite as rosy. She is  betrothed to a boorish man who takes her for granted and seems more  interested in his political status than in her happiness. Luckily, Guido  has set his sights on making her life as interesting as possible. And that  allows the audience the pleasure of rooting for the underdog; a  semi-employed Jewish waiter with one sadly misshapen hat. Although she  doesn't see a way out at first, we all know that Guido's optimism will  eventually triumph over his straight-laced and  narcissistic competitor.

Soon, the two star crossed lovers are married and joined by a  precocious son by the name of Giosu, played superbly by the young actor,  Giorgio Cantarini. He clearly takes after his father and is the apple of  his parents' eyes. It would take a hard-hearted person to avoid loving this  little angle; an angel who will go to any extreme to avoid his bath time.  His other main concern seems to be getting enough time to play with his toy  tank.

But love and optimism are unable to hold back the tide of  history. Italy soon falls in with Germany and begins persecuting their  Jewish population. On Giosu's forth birthday, while his mother is out,  soldiers take he and his father. They are bundled into a truck and then a  train, headed for the concentration camps. As soon as Dora realises what  has happened, she follows them into the depths of hell.

Guido has  other problems to occupy him. Although he doesn't know exactly what is  going to happen, he knows enough to want to shield his son in the only way  he can. While they are in the truck he concocts a story to convince Giosu  that they are taking a surprise trip to celebrate his birthday. As their  situation worsens, the fiction becomes more convoluted. Guido controls  every aspect of his son's perception to convince him they are participating  in a most challenging competition, with a full sized tank as the prize.

Despite the horror of the situation, death all around, brutal  labour,  starvation and dehumanising barracks, Guido focuses all his  efforts on the happiness of his son. Not only does he succeed in protecting  the young boy's fragile soul but it is clear he manages to distract himself  as well. Guido epitomises selflessness. In the brief moments when he is not  labouring for the Nazis or entertaining his son, he finds small ways to  remind Dora that he loves her. I can't think of any more poignant moments  in cinema.

In the end, Guido manages to accomplish what he had set  out to do; protect his son. He manages it so well, that Giosu is convinced  he has won the tank that rolls into camp as the allied army arrives. His  happiness contrasts strongly with the backdrop of death and brutality and  we are drawn to celebrate Guido's achievement; impossible hope met  unthinkable hatred and triumphed. What father could do more for his son?",957830400,5,4121,4.723554301833569
1031340,4,6305426651,"This is not your typical feature film at all; it is rather a series of vignettes and by now most of the ""free"" world knows who is starring in it. It isn't that Roberto Benigni is such a poor choice to occupy centre stage;  he is good enough and funny enough and so on. There is just too much of  him, and no, he isn't that funny.
The ""story"" of the film is interesting  enough when it eventually gets around to telling it. We may even allow  ourselves to be taken in, to some extent, by the childish subterfuge which  is used to protect the boy from the worst of the horrors surrounding him.  But the end is oh, so predictable and I for one couldn't help wanting to  take a peek around the corner to satisfy myself that Benigni wasn't about  to leap back into life and take over the screen again. That may not be the  right way to greet the understated savagery of the Nazis, but somehow  justice was being served at the same time. Enter the Americans, reunion  with mom... I mean - really!

1031345,5,6305426651,"Roberto Benigni brillantly and passionatly portrays an Italian Jewish waiter and bookstore owner, who has a flair at solving life's many riddles, during the waning days of World War II in Europe. Combining Italian Realism  with many elements of Classic Hollywood Cinema, Guido (Benigni) invites the  viewer to find the beauty in each and every day of life, and to openly and  assertively express and embrace love at every opportunity, because one  never knows when and how that love will be tested, or physically torn from  one's self. Guido approaches his ultimate test of his strength of love when  he and his young son are forced into a concentration camp, and his wife, a  non-Jew, chooses to join them. Guido uses his brilliant talent at solving  riddles, and his deep understanding that through an unselfish love, life  can be what you make of it. In this case, Guido solves the real life  riddles of how to help his son survive, and how to help his wife retain  hope in a situation that would leave most of us withdrawn into ourselves by  dispair. He convinces his son that the ""stay"" in the  concentration camp is a planned game for his birthday, and, even though the  game is not much fun, the reward of playing, and winning, is receiving a  real tank of his very own. Guido supports his wife by taking every unusual  opportunity to communicate to her that he and their son are alive, and she  can live one more day in hope that they all will be together again. Guido  understands that life is most beautiful when love is put into juxtaposition  with the ridiculousness of blind hatred fueled by fear. Another theme of  this film is that one must be able to find something of beauty and value to  love within one's self, and without one's self, in order to simply survive  the most horrific riddles, or terrifying life conditions, that humans  sometimes find themselves. Benigni does not make light of the overwhelming  suffering and pain that was experienced by Jews in the concentration camps.  In a special manner, he pays tribute to those who were able to survive --  by chance, will and/or inner faith in the belief that life is inherently  beautiful -- the atrocities they witnessed inflicted upon others, knowing  full well that these same atrocities could be dealt to them at any time.  This is a remarkable and highly passionate film that is best experienced  when reading subtitles, and becoming totally absorbed by the passion of the  spoken Italian language in tandem with the expressive gestures and body  language of the artists in the film. There are very few movies with the  depth of themes that ""Life is Beautiful"" engenders.",957312000,,2652,4.745614035087719

The poignancy of the father's  ability to protect his son from the horrors of the prison camp was  powerful.  His scene of interpreting the German guard's speech almost had  me laughing on the floor, and the myopic insensitivity of the riddle-loving  doctor had me seething.  But only in a second viewing was I able to release  the full gamut of emotions this movie called for.

The  attacks on this movie are senseless by people who don't really get it.  ""Life Is Beautiful"" is not a Holocaust movie, Spielberg already  did the best we've seen in showing the Nazi horrors with ""Schindler's  List,"" ""Life Is Beautiful"" is about a father's love for his  son and his determination to save him.

Roberto Begnini has done this and he uses humor, (and  lighthearted lies), to shield his son from the horrors of the death camp  that they and his wife have been swept away to. It's heartrending to see  them all go through this. To see them plucked out of their familiar and  peaceful surroundings only to be thrown in the middle of Hell itself is  hard to watch. And although the boy is mostly oblivious to the surronding  reality, he hears ""rumors"" of the terrible things that befall  some of the prisoners there. I recently rented this on DVD and was stunned  by the magnificent picture quality. Begnini deserved the Oscar recognition  that he received last year.

The story is so touching, so hauntingly beautiful that five  stars alone aren't enough for it. Like Amazon.com's reviewer said, ""he  accomplishes the impossible""...the film is basically told in two  parts. The first part tells of the story of Guido(Roberto Benigni) who  keeps having accidental encounters with a young, beautiful woman, Dora  (played by Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's wife off the screen), and he is so  fixated by her that he does literally everything he can to see her again.  In the second part, Dora and Guido are married and have a son, Guosu&egrave;.  Guido and his son are taken off to a concentration camp, but Guousu&egrave; is  much too young to understand the enormity of the horrors around him, and  Guido knows this, so he makes it look like a big game for his son...a game  where upon the contestants, amassing a total of 1000 points, win a tank- a  real one.  It's a genuinely heartwarming film with glorious performances by  all. It's so original, so engaging, once you start you don't want to stop  watching it...this film is one of the best films I've ever seen, and also I  believe that all the awards it got, it deserved. It's a beautiful, haunting  film with a very powerful message. Nobody in their right mind would want to  miss this. Bravo, Benigni, bravissimo.",955843200,8,1462,4.78

1031423,5,6305426651,"Get this straight, folks.  This is not another Schindler's List, and it does not attempt to be. Schindler's List is an excellent film, but this is not another documentary picture on the Holocaust.  While it is a fable  based on events during the Second World War and the end is set in a  concentration camp, it is obviously only a movie and not based on real  life.  And who says that every movie made on a particular subject must be  the same?  Begnini has made a film that does not make light of the  Holocaust, but rather tells the tale of a man and his valiant attempts to  shield his son from the attrocities of this horrible war.  He knows what  his ultimate fate will likely be, but he can not bring himself to reveal  this to his little boy.
The first half of this movie is simply  hilarious, with Begnini showing an incredible gift for physical comedy.  It  also serves as a great contrast to the second half of the picture, which is  serious and quite sad to watch.  The subject of the concentration camp is  not dealt with in complete accuracy, obviously, but there are a few scenes  which are easily as visually and emotionally powerful as those in any  documentary picture.
One must remember that this is only a movie.  People go to the movies to see stories, and while some movies do attempt to  represent 100% accurate accounts of historical events, most take a more  liberal approach and simply use the historical informatoin upon which to  base a story of some degree of fiction.  In this respect, as a form of  entertainment, La Vita e Bella is a complete success.  It is a story of a  man who deals with terrible tragedy the way he has dealt with so many other  events in his life, by using humour. Those who say it trivializes the  Holocaust are missing the point, and must realise that this is only a  fable, and not a documentary.  It will make you laugh, it will make you  cry, and it WILL make you think.  As a piece of fictional entertainment, it  is a clear winner.",955324800,12,1991,4.3884297520661155

Analytically, you're not going to  be given a lot to write a paper about, but you will see a very honest  picture, a very clear picture.
Begnini is not Stanley Kubrick, but he  doesn't have to be. The film is simple, just like the title. Just because  an emotiona has been wrung from films coutless times over the years doesn't  mean the emotion is cliched. As long as you treat a subject with honesty  and creativity, you can make it into something worth seeing. I liked Life  is Beautiful for the same reason I like ""Til there was you"" sung  by Paul McCartney. It's not complex. It's just true... and truth doesn't  change. For all you fans of ""deep,"" introspective cinema, don't  dismiss this film becuase of its perceived simplicity. It's not overblown  like Titanic, and it's not the most intricate scrpit ever written. Don't  expect Shindler's List.

His efforts to protect his son from the reality of their  situation are a display of improvisational comedy at it's very best, if I  were a child I'd believe him. Benigni's comic genius is, as is usual with  clowns, offset by his tragic realisation that he alone can  help himself  and his family when, a German Doctor he befriended before the war and who  he thinks can help him, is only interested in 'Guido' for his flair with  riddles rather than his predicament.

I thought of him as the kind of romantic I would like to  be. I was particularly amused by how he made fun of the facists, just to  amuse some school children. As this movie progressed, I found myself  feeling the emotions of the characters.  When he arrives in the camps with  his son, where innocent people are being worked to death and starved to  death, he keeps his son happy, and almost unaware of the suffering.  At the  end, I wept openly and bitterly. I could not contain the emotion at the  end, they were mixes, the most extreme sadness of seeing the Holocaust and  what it did to even this one family, and I found myself uplifed spiritually  at the love that this man had for his wife and son.

1031498,5,6305426651,"I ended up seeing this amazing gem of a film very late.  Like those who saw the Oscar Ceremony in '99 where Director/Star Robert Benigni seemed to be ""all over"" the ceremony, I wondered 'Who is this guy and why  should I care?'.  I hadn't seen his ""little"" film at that time.
I was firmly convinced that ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which I did  see) was the most important film of 1999, way more important than the fun  but low-cal, fat-free ""Shakespeare in Love"".  I still stand by  that conviction -- but make room for TWO important movies from 1999 by  adding ""Life is Beautiful"".
As affecting as ""Ryan""  was, Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" brings humanity -- even  simplicity -- to serious subject matter in a way no film maker has done  since Charlie Chaplin.  That's a bold claim, but rent ""Modern  Times"" (or Chaplin's lesser ""The Great Dictator"") and then  watch Benigni's film.  Surely, he was a ""student"" of Chaplin  films, but he does not merely copy Chaplinesque filmmaking.  That would be  too easy and not worthy of praise -- he takes it and extends it out.  And  the differences Benigni shows between Europeans themselves (Italians and  Germans in particular) are extremely clever and telling about even modern  relationships within Europe.
The scene where he ""translates""  the German guard's orders to the men/prisoners at the concentration camp --  in a way so that his son still ""believes"" in the game -- is one  of the greatest comedy moments I frankly have ever seen on film.  It's not  only effective, it's extremely bold, given the tightrope-walking nature of  the subject matter.  Even with the subtitles, NOTHING gets lost in the  translation.
In conclusion, I can see where people would criticize this  ""little"" film for its simplistic and fairly unrealistic handling  of the holocaust. But I don't think that's the point of this film.  Benigni  does not pretend to have a ""Schindler's List"" here.  The human  spirit is the star and the hero, the Holocaust is the villain that tests  it.
See it view it, let it affect you for the way it deals with a simple,  single human being's ability to preserve the human spirit in himself and  also protect that spirit in his own son and wife, despite all odds against  them.
I don't think anybody who has a sense of history and is a father or  mother of a child, or even just can relate to it as a son or daughter  themselves, can see this movie, be open to it, and not designate seeing it  as a possible changing point in your own life.  Like other famous  ""events"" in your life, you'll remember the day/night you first  saw ""Life is Beautiful"", where you were and who you saw it  with.
NOW I know what all the fuss was about over that funny little man  at the Oscars in March 1999. (By the way, the clips/trailers they show for  this film do not in any way do it justice.)

1031571,3,6305426651,"Let's talk about the quality of the DVD itself - very good on most aspects of sound and picture quality. This was one of the first movies I played on my Dolby Digital sound system and was quite impressed with the technical  quality of this DVD which unfortunately is not always the case with  'foreign' language productions. The English dubbing is best avoided and  should only be used if you tire of reading the subtitles.
As to the  movie itself, cannot say much that has not already been said - after all  232 reviews at the time of writing! All I will add is Benigni is a genius  for coming up with a very visually pleasant concoction (the lights, shadows  and colors in the movie are excellent) of everything that is politically  correct, fashionable, maudlin, and marketable - and making it palatable to  a xenophobic Hollywood generation. Arezzo and Tuscany, a little boy to melt  your heart, romance and rain and steam rising from cobblestone streets, Jim  Carrey-isque like capers and WW II atrocities are just some of the  ingredients in the mixture. Nothing ever really jells or flows. A little  emotional tickle results with the little boy tugging at your heartstrings.  The scenes in the internment camp are sometimes so ludicrous, improbable  and so wild, you have the gas chamber sequences to remind you `Hey! We are  dealing with a serious situation here!'
The backdrop of the Holocaust is  an intriguing choice.  I personally prefer serious treatment of such  sensitive topics - where comedy finds expression, if any, in the fortitude  and wisdom of the characters experiencing the pain. A powerful script and a  strong acting performance should convey these transient and conflicting  emotions - w/o using painful visual inserts (almost as afterthoughts) from  the Holocaust. The script is undecided between comedy and severity and  Benigni as an actor fails to convey the duality of the fabricated  existence.  Benigni instead holds the audience hostage - with a poor  attempt at comedy spread on a canvas of the Holocaust and making us feel a  mixed bag of emotions. Him being shot is a poor attempt at salvaging what  is obviously a very predictable ending.  I expected him to pop up from  behind the bushes with that silly grin on his face.
In conclusion, it  was an intriguing and novel attempt at recording a time and place in  history - and that is where lies the value of this movie.",948758400,2,2409,4.811735941320293

Having said that  another thing that bothers me is that there are people who look at this  movie in the wrong point of view. There're saying that Benigni should not  of taken upon this subject in the attitude in which he did. ALL WRONG!  This movie doesn't make a mockery of WW2. On the contrary! The movie does  in fact show the harsh realities that happened during the war! The ending  of the film demonstrates that. I don't want to give it away. I'm trying to  get people to buy or at least rent it. A great piece of film making. To be  prefectly honest I didn't think a movie like this could be made in today's  day and age.

It's wonderful to know that somebody can come up with a moving  story about a horrible time without having to (attempt to) recreate all the  gory details. We've seen what's left of the real thing at Dachau and  Auschwitz. The film actually would not work without knowing the reality of  the war and the Holocaust, because you wouldn't get the full meaning of  what the father is trying to do for his son. It's the complete lack of  ""reality"" that really makes this work from the perspective of the  storyteller - the young son. Added plusses are no bad language and no  bedroom scenes.

The comic fairy tale romance of pre-WWII Italy at the film's beginning, and the (sanitized) nightmare of a father and his young son being held in a Nazi camp in the second half, work like oil and water; though Benigni tries--valiantly--he can't quite pull it off.  (One wonders if the film  might have worked better had the son known the father was faking his desperate cheerfulness, and was going along with the act to indulge him; then, the subtext might have gelled into something stronger and more poignant.)  And the ""happy"" ending will strike a discordant note with many viewers.  Still, it's almost impossible to criticize a  film which so many have clutched to their hearts as a life-altering  experience--you go with it, or you don't, period.  Many adored Begnini's clowning, whereas others found it as subtle and endearing as a jackhammer to the skull. As it stands, ""Life"" is a brave attempt to offer a different perspective on the war, but in no way does it belong in the same breath as contemporary Holocaust milestones such as ""Schindler's List"" ""Bent"" or ""The Pianist""--or even witty, quality fluff like ""Shakespeare in Love,"" which snatched up some of ""Life's"" Oscars (deservedly so).",947808000,4,1306,4.986175115207374

When I was  watching this film, I didn't know what to make of the second half. It was  supposed to be a serious subject being in prison and working for the Nazis  in WWII. What I found in the second half, was that the subject matter was  not there for laughter as Benigni's character did. It was meant for  seriousness of how humans; how grey the circumstances may be; survive the  best they could. Benigni was making fun of the situation when in all it was  not supposed to be funny. The first half was great just as I thought the  story was about. When watching the second half, I didn't know whether to  laugh or not when watching the character's actions.

However, paying attention  to this movie was no problem. Roberto was great. He really does an  EXCELLENT job throughout this movie. So does his wife in this movie.

Guido (Benigni's character) is so laden with humor, humanity and passion that you find yourself feeling that you,  somehow, know him.  He is everyman who's risen above his circumstances to  face his destiny with dignity and humor.  Benigni walks the finest line of,  I believe, any character in modern cinema.  Here we have a man facing one  of the greatest horrors in history and he does so with a smile and an  innate sense of fantasy in order to shield his beloved son from the tragedy  that's unfolding around them.  This is an enormously human film, touched by  genius.  I dare anyone to walk away unaffected by this charming and  haunting tribute to the endurance of the human spirit.

Benigni's direction is  uncomplicated but effective--he lets the story do the talking.  And while  there is plenty of Roberto's vintage slapstick--the schoolroom scene rivals  Sellers at his goofball best--the film's triumph is the way Benigni marries  comedy with devastating tragedy.  Life is Beautiful gloriously celebrates a  theme seen throughout Benigni's ouevre: the triumph of kindness,  simplicity, and love in the face of cynicism and  evil.

 Bengini's film is about a family he does not want to see destroyed. After he goes to all lengths to win the heart of his princess, why would he want to lose their child?  This is why he develops the point game - to keep his son from exposing himself to the guards...  Many argue that the movie too cynically portrays the events of the Holocaust.  While that may be a valid statment, it should be coupled with the fact that the movie portrays only one isolated family's struggle in both pre-Holucast Italy and occupied Italy.  The scene I found most unexpected is near the end ...  It really made me realize that the US played a huge effort in bringing peace and an end to this destruction of human life and culture. It was here that I realized this movie was really about an international struggle for peace and happiness.  This is where I cried.

But whatever. Nicely photographed, humourous,  nice story.
The key is to remember, is that it is a fairy tale, not a  true story. Therefore the harsh realities of the holocaust were uneeded to  be depicted or in your face. I mean, who alive doesn't know what happened?  The fact is, if you were actually watching, and not waiting for every  opprutunity to jump and critize, is that it was spoke of. ""They make  soap and buttons out of us"", I believe were the words. ""They burn  us in ovens."" Is it really necessary to see them killing people and  the actual processes involved? The fact that it was implied was enough to  remind us of the horror that was the holocaust.
And what were the pile of  bodies there for?
As for him saving his son, who, with a child, wouldn't  have that as is first priority? How about only priority ? I sure would! As  much as I love my son, others would be a way, way remote secondary  consideration.

That notwithstanding the lesson to be learned (in my  opinion) is that optimism (if believed and adhered to) that flies in the  face of harsh reality  can have dire and tragic consequences for the  optimist (Benigni).  Instead of making light of his situation he would  perhaps have been wiser to escape the terrible onslaught that was the  Holocaust and maybe all the tragedy could have been avoided for both him  and his family.
Life was anything but beautiful particularly when the  hard labor began and most specifically when he realized that a perceived  friend was anything but.

It's true that the film is in two  parts in narration, but that really doesn't effect the feeling. Also,  Benigni uses surrealism to a certain degree to illustrate his point.

The first part  of the film is a delightful love story that has so much charm and humor.  It instantly makes you love Roberto Benigni.  He has a chaplin like phsical  humor, but he also has the charm that most comedians fall short of.  The  second part is some of the best cinematography and writing that any film  has ever had.  The charming father has to use his wits to fool his son into  believing that the concentration camp is a resort.  And he makes it into a  game but in reality he is protecting his son from the horrors of the camp,  and he keeps them alive.  It is a story of hope in the human spirit, and  show how important and precious innocence can be to a young boy and how he  keeps the youthful spirit of his son through out the whole ordeal.

Now my input on the DVD experience. The disc contains a dubbed version of the film in  English. We tried watching this version first, but found the dialogue and  story were actually harder to follow than the subtitles! When we started  the film over again with the English subtitles ""on"" we discoved  we were missing Roberto's energy and punctuation. Even if you don't  understand a word of Italian you need to hear the impact in the actor's  voices to appreciate what is being said. Still, if you can't deal with the  subtitles you have a choice. Incidently, the sections of the film which  feature German dialogue are not dubbed so we still have the same experience  as our characters do.
The bonus materials area on the disc features  several TV spots (commercials) for the film. No real bonanza here, but  there is a brief documentary, ""Making Life Beautiful"". It  features footage from various programs where the film has won awards, etc.  It also contains a mini-filmography of other Benigni films and interviews  with his various costars. The documentary tone is very promotion oriented  spending most of its time patting Benigni and company on the  back-deservedly so.

As for the film, you'll have to see for yourself, it certainly has a magical and pleasant way of looking at  life. Even though, actor, writer, director, producer, Roberto Benigni is a  bit energetic with Oscar chairs and lives every minute to the fullest. The  main role couldn't be played any better, than by talented Benigni, himself.  There's a brilliant scene I especially enjoyed, which indicates the passage  of time in a few seconds. The part is when  Guido Orfice (Benigni) follows  the woman he loves (Nicoletta Braschi) into a garden house, as he walks  further, he disappears. As an offline voice calls out to someone (whom we  don't know), a small child appears from the garden house,...we then realize  that the voice is his mother's calling. Guido Orfice and Dora are outside  waiting for their son.  The film explores important values of life, even  when there is sadness and tragedy, there is still room to spread hope,  happiness and laughter.",943833600,3,1074,4.888888888888889

1031805,5,6305426651,"This movie has been called an insulting trivialization of the Holocaust by some because of its humor.  Were it the case that no humor existed in the death camps, perhaps this would be a valid claim.  And yet, this is not  true.  For anyone who has read *Man's Search for Meaning* by deathcamp  survivor and psychologist Viktor Frankl, you'll know what I'm talking  about.  Mr. Frankl writes about how he and a friend made a pact to tell  each other something humorous each day, just to keep the flame of  lightheartedness alive.  Guido out of touch with the horror of his  situation?  No.  On the contrary, he saw with absolute poignancy what his  predicament was, but he used his humor and unique outlook to draw his son  through the death and the fear.
Humor does not necessarily do a  disservice to serious topics such as this.  On the contrary, humor and  solemnity are often inextricably linked, as is shown by this  thought-provoking movie.  To see only funny moments of this movie or to be  entirely focused on the serious subject matter is to miss the point.  The  point is that these two things can and do exist together and, perhaps more  importantly, that humor and a whistful attitude is not the weaker of the  two.",943574400,6,1227,4.595348837209302

1031807,5,6305426651,"Many films, in the movie theater and on television, have documented the horrors of The Holocaust. The best of these -- most notably, Speilberg's masterpiece, ""Schindler's List"" -- relate human anguish and evil  incarnate in startling clarity. What's interesting is that as poignant and  disturbing as these works have been, they often fail to drive home the  unbridled emotion that one would expect from such detail. Perhaps this is  due to a sort of ""historical phenomena;"" intellectually -- and  correctly -- we feel that we should be moved, but it's like reading a text  book, the most profound emotional connection is lost. With ""Life is  Beautiful,"" that elusive bond is crystallized. That is the genius --  yes, genius -- of this film; the relatively cold mental link is superceded  by the ethereal in all of us.
This marvelous film is, as our narrator  informs us, a fable. The humor is onerously silly, at least by American  standards, but it often works. What's unexpectedly wonderful about the  lightheartedness of the first half of the movie is that it masterfully sets  up the second half. Our idyllic little family, Guido, Dora, and Joshua, are  beset upon by a damnable twist of fate -- AND WE ARE TAKEN WITH THEM! What  comes next is nothing short of movie magic, that which makes a film a  classic. Guido, through a series of thoroughly implausible actions, manages  to pull our heartstrings like -- unbelievably -- no other film concerning  The Holocaust ever has!
While the film has come under fire from some  circles for not depicting an egregious event in history accurately or  reverently, I believe that the detractors have focused their senses in the  wrong direction. Put aside your pre-conceptions about what movies relating  the horrors of WWII ""should be like,"" this film conveys the  sorrow and indomitable spirit of a people like no other before it!

1031950,1,6305426651,"I watched this movie last weekend.  I knew very little about it, but thought that Benigni was charming on Oscar night.  I thought Spielberg was a bad sport. After seeing the movie, I guess Spielberg was annoyed because  ""Life is Beautiful"" is a ridiculous movie, and I agree.  I found  it offensive, and pandering to audiences who are tired of all the violence  in the world, that they just want to see a movie and feel good. A lot of  reviewers here mentioned 'Hogan's Heroes"", which I never watched  because it seemed stupid. Some mentioned ""Seven Beauties"" which  succeeded in everything that ""Life is Beautiful"" failed at.  The  fact that is historically perposterous doesn't not even have to be  mentioned.  The fact that he reduced monumental events to a Marx Bros.  schtick is what I found offensive.  The entire movie made no sense.  In  reality, he would have been shot when he did his first gag while getting on  the train!  And it just got worse from there.  I am not Jewish, I have no  agenda, but I do have a respect for history and people who survive horrific  events, who lived to tell through heroism and force of will.  A buffoon  out-smarting Nazis by sight-gags and double-talk is an insult!  And I do  not think this is his niave attempt to make a movie of value...I am sure  Benigni knew exactly when people would laugh, would cry and how they would  feel when it was over.  There is no visual violence so kids could see it.  And I am so surprised that this movie is considered an antidote to  Hollywood movies, when it uses every manipulative ploy to win over  audiences.  This is not a movie about the human spirit,  it's about a  actor/director who knew exactly how to give people what they want.  I am  writing this for the few other people who wrote negative reviews, because  after I saw the movie I wondered if I was the only one who felt like this.",942624000,50,1877,4.476190476190476
1031951,5,6305426651,"Okay, a few folks have said they did not like this film. Fair enough, I didn't like Good Will Hunting.
But let's take a look here. If you know what this film is all about, then the first half of it will astound you. I  mean, egg on faces? It comes startingly close to Benny Hill for 'want of a  laugh track'.
Ahh, but the warmth grows on you, and then...
The second  half.
Few scenes are as emotional as when Guido has to reassure his son  that the Jews 'aren't going to be made into soap.' The film takes a turn  for the harshness and doesn't let up.
Schindler's List was a phenomenal  film, showing the utter horror of the holocaust, but it missed one thing:  the notion of hope. No one in Spielberg's masterpiece continually believes  that 'life is beautiful'. All we see is the horror, the downfall, the pain.  And while that makes for a fantastic dramatic punch, it negates any humor  or spirit the prisoners may have had to blanket themselves from the  harshness, and this humor surely existed.
Guido knows very soon that he  is going to die. But, the love for his son outweighs the need to DISPLAY  hopelessness. If nothing else, he must protect his son. So he convinces him  it's all a game. Simple, buffoonish...
and damn identifiable. Who here  can honestly say they wouldn't do anything they could to protect their  sons/daughters from knowing the biggest evil on Earth? Guido manages to  keep his son involved in 'the game' while he himself knows it will most  likely end according to an evil thought.
The end scene, where Guido  realizes he is going to be killed, and yet does a goofy march to make his  son laugh, is one of the most powerful sights to ever be associated with  the trauma the Nazi's inflicted on the world.
If you didn't like this  film, fine. But don't say it mocked the Holocaust. If anything, it's a  tribute to the flame of life that wouldn't be blown out.
Laughter seeps  into any tradegy, if the love for life is there. Anne Frank said something  to the effect that 'in spite of all this, I still feel people are good in  heart'. She had hope.
She knew life was beautiful.

Benigni succeeds in drawing to their absurd, comic conclusions the principles of both racism and anti-semitism.  Just 2 examples: When asked  to tell a class of Italian pupils about the racial superiority of the  Italians, he exposes his navel and is proud of what an Aryan navel it is.  Or when his little son asks why certain stores now forbid Jews and dogs, he  tries to protect his son by saying it is the personal preference of the  shopkeeper.  Why, some vendors, for example, forbid Ostrogoths and spiders!  (His son doesn't like spiders).
It was a razor-thin, high-wire balancing  act to try to bring humor to an insanely evil period in humanity's history,  but he succeeded.

Many aspects of the film are not realistic, like Guido staying with his son Joshua in a concentration camp, that's very unlikely.  In many instances the children and elderly are killed as soon as they arrived.  If you want to know what it was really like in the ghetto and concentration camps, view schindlers' list or the pianist.

1032015,4,6305426651,"Comparing ""Life is Beautiful"" to ""Hogan's Heroes"", as some have done in these reviews, requires a big stretch of the imagination.  Personally, I find these one-star reviews to be indicative of contempt, a  desire to NOT like this movie, maybe even before it's watched.  Some of the  comments in the 5-star reviews also seem a tad over-enthusiastic to me.  Obviously, movie hype causes some people to backlash against it even as  others embrace it completely.
In any case, it is NOT ""Hogan's  Heroes"";  there aren't any snappy sitcom one-liners, the Nazi's aren't  played as laughable buffoons, and Holocaust victims aren't portrayed as  happy, peppy people who feel just fine in their current situation and  surroundings.  Certainly, they're not made fun of, and the horrors of the  Holocaust always loom under the surface of the story, contrary to other  claims that they're downplayed.  You don't need gore a la' Private Ryan in  order to show that war (and consequences thereof) are hell.
What we do  have in ""Life is Beautiful"" (if taken at face value and not  overreacted to) is a very unique, funny, and touching film.  The humor is  solely based on the character of Guido, and on the elaborate lies he cooks  up to protect  his young son from the truth of their situation.  However,  there is ALWAYS an underlying sense of fear and risk--Guido isn't at all  unconcerned about their true situation.  The only criticism I have is that  the concentration camp set was too small and unconvincing.  It looked more  like (and probably was) an abandoned factory complex.  I understand that it  was all the filmmakers needed to fit the scope of the movie, but still, to  me, this was somewhat distracting.

It is introduced by the  grown son, leading the audience to believe that he is telling the story of  his parents & the horror with the memories he has of them: less savage,  scary and menacing than that seen in Schindler's List -- BECAUSE his  father's love, humanity and sense of life sheilded his son from those  horrors.

This film is at best  boring and silly; at worst the most callus and offensive treatment of the  subject of the extermination camps.  ""Funnyman"" Benigni with his  ""rubberface"" and his ""humorous antics"" spends the first  half of the film reveling in his image of himself as a free-spirited soul  undaunted by convention, using every slapstick cliche the public was bored  to tears by generations ago (I kept waiting for him to rescue his  ""Princess"" fron the railroad tracks).

To hear criticisms of this film  is like hearing criticisms of my children.  I take both personally.  See  it.",925344000,,671,4.512605042016807

7888963,5,6305426651,"Probably the best Benigni film. Heart-rending moments of Nazi horror interspersed with heart-warming courageous humanity. Just don't bother asking your child to sit through this...it's just too dark a plot for children. Plenty of difficult realities here despite the family-friendly cover and title.

We are asked to laugh at the dumb inhumanity of monsters while smiling at Benigni's character's continual attempts to fool his son about the nature of their situation while their entire family is in reality imprisoned at a concentration camp after the rounding up of Italian Jews hits their quaint little town. Spoiler Alert: Benigni's character meets his demise toward the end and this is not dealt with in an effort to maintain the story as a triumph of humanity over inhumanity, which will leave a bad taste for many, if not most. As it is presented, it seems to do accomplish what it sets out to do, but this is certainly not a probing, realistic treatment of the Holocaust, by any means. Nor does it belittle the horror by belittling the instruments of that horror from time to time. Overall, this is a feel-good movie that rides the razor's edge constantly.",1522886400,,1164,4.969230769230769
