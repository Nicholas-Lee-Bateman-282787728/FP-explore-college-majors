7873660,5,6304473982,One of my favorite NG specials.  I have probably watched it 100 times (no kidding).  We now raise close to 80% of our own meat and 50% of our vegetables.  Hoping to do more!,1417737600,,173,4.029411764705882

7873662,5,6304473982,"I naturally agree with the previous reviews of this splendid Documentary which encapsulates the dramatic distinct Seasons in that part of Alaska. The families featured on this film certainly led active lives considering the harsh extremes of the Seasons. I travelled up to the Northern Coastal plain in the Brooks Range a few years ago, and was privileged to be in the company of , Roger The Bush Pilot , it was  great travelling with a person so well versed on the country, and  Wildlife of Alaska. I give this film my high recommendation.",1200268800,,540,4.73404255319149
7873663,5,6304473982,"I watched it several times in the few days since it arrived.  This video gives a real picture of what life in the Alaskan bush can be like.  Although there's not an abundance of formal teaching, it's very informative seeing how these bush families live, eat, hunt, get supplies, and get along.",1148428800,,293,4.615384615384615
7873664,5,6304473982,"This movie so touched my life that I was often left wondering what became of these people. Well, now I know. There is a book called ""The Final Frontiersman"" by James Campbell. He is a cousin of Heimo Korth and wrote the book in 2002 and had it published in 2004. This book is a must for anyone who loved this movie and wondered what ever happed to these people. You would be surprised to hear what they are up to now.

Enjoy!",1136851200,,425,4.120481927710843
7873665,5,6304473982,"Braving Alaska is a must for anyone who loves the great out doors; my wife and I loved this movie so much that we watched it over a dozen times if not more.  My wife and I fish, Hunt, Camp, Explore and more and this movie was great to watch. It shows how people can survive in the wilderness and live off the land and not abuse it.  If you are an out doors person or just love the great out doors I highly recommend this great adventure video.  I wish they would make a second part to this video. God Bless America.",1081900800,,515,3.9805825242718447
7873666,5,6304473982,"I love Alaska!  I fell in love with the state even more after watching this video.  I love, the outdoors, peace, wolves, eagles, and the northern lights.  This movie had all of these and much more.  I was looking for some pictures of eagles however there was none to be found which was sad but you should buy it if you love the outdoors and nature...Alaska!!!!!",1020729600,,361,4.424242424242424
7873667,5,6304473982,This video shows real-life-living-in-the-bush experiences. I liked this video a lot because I'm fascinated w/northern Alaska & the lifestyle there. This video is very good at showing this.,1016841600,,188,5.75
7873668,5,6304473982,"I watched this video from a rental one evening and liked it so much that I bought a copy for myself when it became available. I enjoy everything about Alaska and this film depicted the life of 4 families living that life. I am sure there are more bush families out there in Alaska, but this film helped share that life. There is a pure and simple life plan with these families that alot of us would like to be in their place and not have to worry about excessive crime and modern problems. I highly recommend this film to anyone that wants to live this type of lifestyle or just wants information about the Alaskan backcountry.",986688000,,627,4.367521367521367
