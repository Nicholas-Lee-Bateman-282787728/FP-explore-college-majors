3724263,5,B001NY4X3W,"I enjoyed the entire series of Family Ties but on the season 5 DVD, I've noticed at least 4 episodes that seem to be included incorrectly in this season. Season 5 starts with Andrew attending preschool which would make him 3 years old, but there are episodes here from before Andrew was born, & when Andrew is a baby. No idea why they weren't included in the previous seasons, it's like they were forgotten about & added later...",1236988800,6,429,4.512820512820513
3724264,5,B001NY4X3W,"Season Five of Family Ties may be best remembered for two things: Baby Andrew grew up a LOT over the summer, and Michael J. Fox's amazing performance in the hour-long episode ""A, My Name Is Alex.""
(SPOILERS AHEAD)
Brian Bonsall joins the cast as preschool-aged Andrew Keaton.  While Bonsall's screentime is understandably limited, the mere fact that Alex's little brother can now speak and interact with the others helps create some great comic moments.  Alex also has to deal with the loss of steady girlfriend Ellen (though actress Tracy Pollan would eventually become Mrs. Michael J. Fox in real life).  It's also a great year for Nick and Mallory, including probably my all-time favorite scene in which Mallory tries to tutor Nick (""High School Confidential"").  And life would continue to imitate art when Tina Yothers tried her hand at singing after Jennifer Keaton joins a band.

Still, it's the groundbreaking ""A, My Name Is Alex"" which leaves the largest impression.  Alex is overcome with remorse and self-doubt when he backs out of a commitment to help his friend Greg, and then Greg is killed in a car accident.  The second half of the episode, which was presented commercial-free back in 1987, is basically Fox on a darkened stage, with family and friends appearing in little vignettes illustrating key points in Alex's life.

""Walking into that kitchen was like walking into a hug,"" Alex observes.  And for those of us with fond memories of this quintessential 80's sitcom, here's another 4 discs' worth of hugs.",1235952000,20,1525,4.97244094488189

Mallory and Jennifer are hilarious in different ways and Alex - well he's just a conservative gem. I highly recommend this groundbreaking show, I also recommend seasons 1-4.

3724331,2,B001NY4X3W,"Love the show, that's why I ordered the DVDs, however, from season three on there are episodes missing, episodes that are from other seasons, and it upsets the viewing pleasure.  Andy will be of preschool age in one episode, the very next show he's only one year old, then the next he'll be in preschool again.  Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.  So, the two stars are for the lousy arrangement, the episodes being mixed up and in the wrong seasons, not just within one but within several seasons, and the interference in viewing pleasure, not the show itself or the DVD quality which are both great.",1396569600,8,1157,4.485714285714286

This is the first season where they really go out of their way to tee up lines for Andy (the new baby brother).

There are still lots of good episodes and important issues, though.  It did not deter me from wanting Season 6.

I do like this season, but the whole:
Step 1:  Set up the kid
Step 2:  Have him say a line he obviously doesn't understand

3724338,4,B001NY4X3W,"While the episodes were enjoyable to watch, some were out of place. Andrew's age jumped back and forth between a baby not yet talking and a little boy with dialogue. At least one episode was made before there was an Andrew. I expected to see a soliloquy about Ellen in this season. Maybe I confused the seasons, but the closest episodeto that kind of thing in this season was in two parts and was a conversation between Alex and an off-camera counselor. I felt that this season was a poor recreation. Did they really jump around like that in the original airing? What else was missed in earlier seasons if some of the episodes from those seasons are being placed in this season?

I looked it up on Wikipedia and apparently this show did not air episodes in chronological order. Three episodes that were shot in season 4 aired during season 5. This happens today in shows like ""Family Guy"", but it is not as noticeable since it is a cartoon and the characters never age. This really threw me off when I saw that the opening was from season 4. In the next season there is one episode that was shot back in season three before Andy was born.  To anybody who watched this in the 80's, how did it feel when you saw episodes shot during previous seasons being aired as new episodes of the current season that was being shown at the time? Would you think it was a rerun of an episode you may have missed? Other than this strange occurrence towards the end of the season, I thought this was a great season overall.

3724345,5,B001NY4X3W,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The fifth season of ""Family Ties"" sees the show nearing the top of its creative powers.  At the time(1986-87), it was enjoying a run of cultural popularity that very few shows have ever enjoyed.  Michael J. Fox was at the center of a rock-solid core and supporting cast.

The season premiere ""Be True To Your Preschool"" finds Alex at loggerheads with his parents over their choice of preschools for youngest son Andy, played by newcomer Brian Bonsall.  Of course, it is established early that Andy will share many of Alex's traits, but this never becomes cloying because of talented writing, Bonsall's ability to naturally deliver his lines, and a natural acting and personal chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Brian Bonsall.

The second episode of the season ""Starting Over"" poignantly recalls Tracy Pollan's positive impact as Ellen Reed on the previous season and convincingly ends her storyline, as a despondent Alex latches on to an unlikely romantic prospect.  It is revealed that ballet dancer Ellen got a dance scholarship in Paris, and Alex learns hard lessons about the difficulty and necessity of moving on from a beloved partner.  The reprise of Billy Vera and the Beaters' ""At This Moment"" is a particularly nice touch.

Other episodes from this season highlight comedic and dramatic moments with ease.  ""Ms. Wrong"" is a classic two-parter with Mallory and Nick suddenly staring at a hilarious impromptu wedding.  Special mention goes to Michael Gross for his priceless over-the-top singing during this episode.  Mr. Gross is truly a master of dry humor.  Dramatic episodes include the two-part ""O Brother,"" which brings back Steven's brother Rob as he's going through a divorce.  Additionally, ""A. My Name is Alex"" may be the series' finest moment.  Alex's best friend is killed in a car accident which Alex narrowly missed being in, and he's wracked with survivor's guilt.  Michael J. Fox gives a brilliant performance in a tightly-written show.

Also featuring the two-part season finale ""It's My Party,"" as well as a pre-""Married...With Children"" Christina Applegate in the show ""Band On The Run,"" the fifth season of ""Family Ties"" is versatile entertainment.",1287532800,4,2195,5.155367231638418
3724346,5,B001NY4X3W,"I've always been a great fan of Family Ties.  This was one of my favorite shows growing up.  I hope that you work on releasing the other seasons soon, so that I can complete my TV collection.  Awesome fast delivery.  Great job!!",1272931200,2,228,4.357142857142857

3724367,5,B001NY4X3W,"Well, if you tuned in on September 25th, 1986 to see the season premiere of your favorite sitcom (Family Ties) - you would think the tv world had aged rapidly. I am, of course, specifically talking about Andrew's transition from infant to 4 year old. Although highly inconsistent, it was the right move. Enter Andy into the series of weekly escapades.

Fox is still at his best, spitting out one-liners like hot cakes. This season contains my all-time favorite episode of the series. It's actually a two-parter entitled ""'A', My Name is Alex"". The episode revolved around Alex's search for his life's meaning after the sudden death of his friend. For those of us that have been in the unfortunate position of losing a best or good friend, we can empathize with Alex's troubled mind. In the end we see a calm takeover the turmoil that plagues Alex's mind.

The season packs a strong punch & cleverly reflects the teenage recluse of the 80s.

3724370,4,B001NY4X3W,"FAMILY TIES was an American sitcom that aired on NBC for 7 seasons, from 1982-89 with 180 episodes that reflected the move in America from the cultural liberalism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservation of the 1980's and was particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex P. Keaton(Michael J. Fox, Mallory Keaton(Justine Bateman)whom was a more materialistic youngwoman in contrast to her feminist mother, athletic tomboyish Jennifer Keaton(Tina Yothers) along with their ex-hippie parents Elyse Keaton(Meredith Baxter)whom was an independent architect and Steven Keaton(Michael Gross)whom was the station manager of local pubic television station WKS whom all lived in suburban Columbus, Ohio and eventually Steven & Elyse had a 4th child named Andy in 1984 when FAMILY TIES was in its 3rd Season which was FAMILY TIES 1984-85 Season, which was eventually portrayed by Brian Bonsall in this 1986-87 Season.

As a matter of fact; this 1986-1987 Season of FAMILY TIES was one of my favorite seasons throughout it's whole 7-year run on NBC and was the first season of the show when Andy had his first speaking role.

This was also the season when Ellen(Traci Pollan) moves away from Ohio and breaks up with Alex as well as the last season when FAMILY TIES was shown on Thursday nights since NBC had moved this show to Sunday nights in the Fall of 1987 when FAMILY TIES kicked off it's 6th Season.

FAMILY TIES was also an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and the show even won multiple awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and the song ""Without Us"" that was used at the introuduction of each episode was performed by Johnny Mathis & Deniece Williams.

FAMILY TIES also had quite a few Hollywood stars appearing on the show before they were famous and/or during the early years of their acting careers like
*Christina Applegate whom is best known for her role as the ditzy, but drop-dead gorgeous blonde bombshell(Kelley Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN had guest starred as Jennifer's band-member(Kitten)in the episode ""Band On The Run"" which was before Applegate was even a star and before MARRIED WITH CHILDREN made its debut on Fox in the Spring of 1987

*Judith Light whom guest starred in Season 2 as Steven's colleague who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce him

*Tom Hanks appeared in during the 1st and 2nd Seasons as Elyse's alcoholic brother(Ned)

*Geena Davis portrayed inept housekeeper(Karen)in Season 3

*River Phoenix guest starred in Season 2 as 14-year old math whiz who develops a crush on Jennifer after a tutoring session with Alex

*Courtney Cox whom is best known for her role as the foxy Monica Geller on FRIENDS co-starred as Alex's girlfriend(Lauren Miller)in the last 2 seasons of this show which were Seasons 6 and 7 of FAMILY TIES

*Julia Louis Dreyfus played a lawyer in the 2-part episode ""Read It & Weep"", but had later co-starred on both the FAMILY TIES spinoff series DAY BY DAY when that show debuted on NBC in the Spring of 1988 and then eventually co-starred on SEINFELD when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1990.

*Crispin Glover guest starred as one of Alex's friends on the episode ""Birthday Boy"" whom is well-known for his role as geeky George McFly in the movie BACK TO THE FUTURE which came out in theatres in the Summer of 1985

*Corey Feldman guest starred as Jennifer's 7th-grade classmate in the episode ""The Disciple""

*Stephen Baldwin which is the youngest of the 4 Baldwin brothers had guest starred as a member of a therapy-group he and his girlfriend attended together

FAMILY TIES Fifth Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to NBC"" since that was NBC's slogan from September of 1986 thru August of 1987 along with the fact that I was living in the Imperial Valley and was 14 years old in the 8th grade at Wilson Jr. High School in my hometown(El Centro, CA)and when I used to watch FAMILY TIES at 8:30 PM right after watching THE COSBY SHOW at 8PM on NBC every Thursday night.",1242259200,2,4913,5.025830258302583

3724372,5,B001NY4X3W,"For a long time, I have loved Family Ties, and I still do! I received this as an Easter present. I'm glad they added Andy to the Keaton family because he's so cute and adorable! During this season Alex pulls Andy out of preschool, Alex is depressed because Ellen leaves to go to Paris, Alex has a hard time working with his boss because she is a woman, Jennifer tries to fit in with the cool kids by acting snobby to her family and friends, Mallory wants to marry Nick for the wrong reasons, Alex helps Nick finish high school, Jennifer wants to start a rock band, (I thought Tina Yothers had a beautiful singing voice, she should have released an album) and much more! I didn't care for the episode that seemed like a stage play. I highly recommend FAMILY TIES: THE COMPLETE 5TH SEASON!!!",1239580800,,789,4.410958904109589

3724374,5,B001NY4X3W,"Another excellent season for Family Ties, Mallory gets more attractive with each new season and Alex more hilarious.",1238803200,,116,5.5
3724375,5,B001NY4X3W,"Family Ties is one of my favorite shows and the 5th season is definitely one of the best. It's extremely well written, funny, and Michael J. Fox is at his best.

For the people confused about the episodes that seem ""out of order"" because all of the sudden Andy has gone back to being a baby and stuff like that...it is because some episodes were filmed but not shown originally.

In this season, The Big Fix episode was filmed for the 3rd season (1984-1985) but didn't air until the 5th. Matchmaker and It's My Party were filmed for the 4th (1985-1986) but didn't air until the 5th as well.",1238198400,10,590,4.4036697247706424
3724376,2,B001NY4X3W,"Its so hard for me to give Family Ties such a low rating.  Perhaps one of the best sitcoms in the history of television, complete with memorable moment after memorable moment, this show was the beacon of good writing, amazing acting, and performances we won't soon forget.

But I simply cannot stand by and not voice my outrage at CBS DVD and their butchering of the finest show in the entire run of this series.

Season Five featured an episode called ""My Name is Alex""...a ground-breaking episode not only because of the superb talents of Michael J. Fox, but also because of how it was originally broadcast.  When first aired, it ran for one hour, the final half hour being completely uninterrupted by commercials and, from what I can tell, unedited.  It played out like a stage performance, with Alex (Michael J. Fox) going thru every part of his life, searching for answers as to why his friend would be killed in a car accident and he be allowed to live.  Watching it in its entirety, you feel the back and forth, the conflicting emotions, and the roller coaster ride he goes on.  The viewer is right along with him.

Sadly, this DVD features the syndicated version, which cuts the episode into two shows.  It cuts right in the middle of Alex's journey, going instead to end credits of the first show.  The 2nd show then begins part-way thru his session with his psychiatrist, thus killing the momentum of the show, and the entire reason it was aired in its entirety the first time.

I'm just lucky I still have the VHS I recorded off-air back in the mid-80s.  That will continue to be the only way I'll watch ""My Name is Alex"".

Sigh.",1237248000,32,1640,4.537414965986395
