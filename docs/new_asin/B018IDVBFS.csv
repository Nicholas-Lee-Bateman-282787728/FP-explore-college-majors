7548950,4,B018IDVBFS,"Yes, there is that one scene that people are going to talk about. No, that is not nearly what the whole movie is about. Once you move beyond the idea of puppets getting it on, it really is a beautiful movie. The humanism that you can feel from a cast of non-human characters is almost surreal. Kaufman once again is showing off his writing and directing skills, with tones of Eternal Sunshine and John Malkovich in the back of your mind.

I was left feeling very introspective after seeing this movie, and it affected me emotionally, which I believe is a sign of a good film.",1453075200,3,575,4.4245283018867925

7548954,4,B018IDVBFS,"A few points / warnings about Anomalisa to put it into perspective:

 The stop-motion animation took 3 years to do, and is what sets Anomalisa apart from other movies in recent [past decade] memory. The disquieting realism makes you question how Anomalisa was made; at first I thought it was based on the motions of actors, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Scanner-Darkly/dp/B003M8NGQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Scanner Darkly</a>, which used live action footage later animated over.

 Most of it takes place at the Hotel Fregoli. The Fregoli delusion is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise (Wikipedia). The plot will make more sense knowing this.

 Written and co-directed by Charlie Kaufman, the mind that brought you&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-John-Malkovich/dp/B007A4Y1Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being John Malkovich</a>.

 I don't care what people say, there's something creepy about the puppet sex scene here; although not intended to be similar, it's nonetheless a far cry from the humorous puppet sex scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Team-America-World-Police/dp/B010QCIAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Team America: World Police</a>. It will surely lead to some negative reviews simply due to its realism. After the scene, Anomalisa becomes surreal once again.

 The heartfelt, cringeworthy speech given by the protagonist towards the end displays every bit as much emotion as you could expect an actor to muster -- but it's a puppet!

 You don't notice the unremarkable in daily life until you watch it: when every character has the same voice, the banality and predictability that hides in plain sight becomes unveiled.",1451952000,35,1903,6.419607843137255
7548975,5,B018IDVBFS,"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. I was lucky enough to hear. Most movies look the same and sound the same. I wait patiently for a writer or director to come along who has something to say. Kaufman has something to say, but sadly, not everyone can (or should) hear.

7548983,5,B018IDVBFS,"Clearly the had the funds to hire more voice actors but also you had a choice to watch till the end which makes it clear why they didn't and should not have. Anomalisa is not really heart wrenching, no, but it has the type of melancholy you get when you leave a certain age behind, alone, not even bothering to blow out a candle because you've become so withdrawn from all the bs life had to offer. This movie is almost haunting, little things that stick with you like his rant about dumbing down America, the realization that everyone are just clones, the ending scene where Emily is a real person and you can tell that everything was just one persons realistic perception of a pessimistic world. The way he drags through life where no individuality exists and questioning it is insanity.... I just loved it.",1518220800,,809,4.5479452054794525

7549005,5,B018IDVBFS,"Charlie Kaufman has a certain understanding of human nature that few artists are able to capture so succinctly. Anomalisa is simply beautiful in its animation, story, acting, and the underlying message. No other animated film looks like this one and strangely makes it even more human. It tells a surface story that is somewhat surreal, but easy to grasp but as with any Kaufman film, there is a great deal of depth that can take numerous viewings to fully comprehend and appreciate. If you are looking for an achingly human, adult story with a great deal of craftsmanship, care, and depth, Anomalisa is simply wonderful.",1517961600,,621,4.923809523809524

7549061,4,B018IDVBFS,"I identified with these characters. The pacing of the movie felt honest and the fact that it was animated, so that you heard the actors voices as if cocooned through a telephone, created an unusually intimate experience of the story.

It was poetic and it represented certain painful parts of life that I rarely see depicted anywhere. It's nice, sometimes, to see those parts of life in a movie, so that you don't have to go around feeling like your own life experience is the anomaly.

I didn't give it five stars because in the end I was a little underwhelmed by the emotional impact. But it was 100% worth the watch. I'll probably watch it again.",1505952000,,649,4.538461538461538

Never mind the fact that every character but one in the movie had the same male voice (females included). It was very distracting. Nevertheless, I hung in there for the message it intended to deliver; but in the end, I was relieved when it was finally over. Kind of like a nagging headache.",1505001600,,545,4.405940594059406

7549100,4,B018IDVBFS,"This film is about a man who experiences all humans as the same face and same voice (albeit on male and female bodies of different ages) until he meets someone different who he believes will change his life.  Like other Charlie Kaufman movies this film has layers- it presents different  dimensions of reality and lets the viewer decide how to interpret.  I personally found the protagonist to be unlikeable- but I think that's the whole point.  He is so disconnected from others that it's hard to tell (except in a scene at the end) whether or not his view of other people is reality or just a result of his psychological issues.  He is rather a jerk to the women in his life.  This movie is rated R for very good reasons- there is full frontal nudity in both male and female characters and sexual content.  There is also lots of profane language.  The animation is stylish and interesting.  This movie is a psychological study, not full of action or thick with plot.",1499472000,2,968,4.5491329479768785
7549101,2,B018IDVBFS,"This is at least the fourth Kaufman film I've seen and by far the weakest. My first issue was that there were some very dull scenes; I browsed the internet when the pace got too slow. My second issue was that while the movie's premise--that the protagonist suffers from the Fregoli delusion or something similar--is interesting, you need more than that to make a feature-length film work. Since the movie focuses so heavily on the protagonist, it really ought to have developed him further. (E.g., how or why did he develop this condition? Why hasn't he sought professional help?) I felt that by simply presenting the protagonist's problems without exploring them in any real depth, the movie was rather simplistic and one-dimensional.",1499472000,,735,5.032786885245901

Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

In this stop motion film from Charlie Kaufman, I related to the male protagonist a good deal, but really related to ""Anomalisa"" (though I'm a dude, sue me, haha).  About 2 human, broken, lost souls making a connection in this world, which is all I think most of us really want.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit (and Anomalisa) :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494547200,,1402,4.6396761133603235

And to me, the fact that it is smooth, seamless stop-motion filmmaking, a sub-category of animation, predisposes it to be at the top of my list. That's because there's no short way around stop-motion; hand-moving an actual 3-dimensional object in the frame millimeter by millimeter while shooting it frame by frame to achieve a smooth moving sense of reality. No computer interpolation here. The love story wrought is a great one which I won't spoil by giving away here; it unfolds slowly throughout the film to a quiet crescendo which reveals the passion, imperfection and wonder of love.

7549169,2,B018IDVBFS,"It was quite boring.  It really seemed that they just attempted to showcase computer animation and how they could make it feel believable/human.  One thing that really drove me crazy was the use of many male voices for the female characters, which made it difficult to understand who was speaking or if some characters were straight or gay.  The story covers two days in the character's life, with many scenes being basic everyday tasks people experience (e.g. checking into the hotel and the interaction with front desk, bellboy, room service, etc...)",1485907200,,552,5.043956043956044

So I went out of my way to see this at one of the few in my state that were showing it. But after seeing it, I left feeling like it was a waste of time and money.  Disappointment isn't the word.  Boring, dreary, unlikable characters, no plot, no character changes.  The 'sex' scene is overly long and cringe-inducing, especially with the stop-motion.  This might have worked if it stayed as a (very) short film, which was the original idea.  But as a full-length, it drags on, with nothing happening.  But I guess that is the point of the movie.

Why just the one male voice for *all* the secondary characters? That was confusing at first, and then distracting, and finally too annoying to continue tolerating.

So - animation was deft, tons of technical virtuosity there.

7549416,5,B018IDVBFS,"*Update* 5/23/18, Watching for the 37th time today. Realized how unfortunate it is that all the negative reviews were written in the same voice.

This movie was AMAZING.  I have watched it 5 times in as many days. It is true, in the first ten minutes, I wondered what the heck was going on, but as the movie played out, I was sucked in and everything started making sense. It is artistic, and there are so many little things I notice each time I watch it, that tie to another part of the movie that I didn't notice before. Every bit, every detail, is purposeful - All the way down to the song that plays with the credits (which I now also love). It is also funny.
  This film will leave you with a little more wonder, a little more self-reflection, and maybe even with a little more awareness of people around you. I am shocked by all the 1-star reviews - though maybe that's why I loved the film so much - part of the theme is not fitting in and becoming bored with the mundane around you (ahem 1-star reviewers). Is it me? Is it them? You'll never know. This film does  NOT end with unicorns and rainbows - it ends like it would in real life. I think that may have disappointed some.

This technique allows the filmakers to underline the human condition of self loathing and self doubt and the difficulty of loving another for her differences rather than hating her for the similarities her humanity hold to your own. They do so by using the same male voice for all the characters except for a woman the protagonist falls for, until he starts to view her as an extension of himself, another failed human being at which time her voice mutates to that of all the others.

Congratulations!  You have found your thing.

Granted this movie is not defined by ""clay sex"" as the sex scenes are short, but still, just the thought of someone out there thinking, ""Man, I gotta make a film that includes a couple of puppets doing the nasty"" is unsettling to me.  In all fairness, it is probably equally worrisome that there are uninformed jackasses such as myself who are desperate enough to watch a movie with no real clue to what it is about.  But cut me some slack: I read one review that said, "" It is best not to know anything about this movie before you watch it.""  I gave this piece a chance.

Yeah, no.

No, the puppets in this cimimatic wonder are not to blame.  They are not the guilty party here.

I was a bit shocked at the sex scenes not because I am a prude, but just did not know what to think about it! I think too much was left out I could not understand the real meaning as to the message. I did not understand why he was hearing double and the weird things as to the disturbance of what was happening in his head while looking into the mirror, did not know why he was hearing talking in the bathroom that scared him unless it was the Japanese talking doll he bought as a gift or something that was in a box or that spontaniously was talking that ended up on the floor when he got home and was sitting there watching and listening to it repeat words over and over.  I assume he was in some kind of crisis in his life. I think it was a dumb movie but that is just my opinion.

In the beginning of the movie it was confusing to hear male voices out of even female characters until Anomalisa who seemed to be the one female voice that seem to get his attention that he was wanting her to keep talking and singing. It was out of listening to her that he begin to be interested in what another person was saying that changed him somehow.

(CK shares directing credit with puppetmeister Duke Johnson.)  I should add that the film spends a good 20 of precious running time detailing the annoying, dehumanizing aspects of an overnight stay at a downtown business hotel in Cincinnati

Our bummed-out protagonist, Michael, is a motivational speaker who teaches customer service reps how to increase productivity by turning routine transactions into real human interactions; judging by his pained responses to a chatty cabdriver and an oversolicitous bellhop, its a skill he hasn't mastered yet himself.  As a symbol (or maybe a symptom) of his failure to connect, everyone he talks to speaks with the same thin, affectless voice (supplied by character actor Tom Noonan), except oneLisa, a sweet-natured, fairly basic young woman with a captivating voice all her own (that of Jennifer Jason Leigh, no less). David Thewliss wintry Manchester accent is perfect for Michael.

Their brief encounter, including a labor-intensive puppet sex scene, is tender, charming and totally unexpected (by me at least), though CK undercuts the impact of their scenes together, and the poignancy of what follows, with cryptic clues that suggest that Lisa is just a figment of Michaels love-starved imagination, that he has somehow willed her into existence (after youve seen the film, Google Anomalisa Japanese sex doll for some intriguing online theorizing).  I watched it twice; the first time through I was skeptical, but once it was clear that this one wasn't going to be another sad-assed dud like Synecdoche, I was totally caught up in the Kaufman magic.

7549740,4,B018IDVBFS,"This film is hauntingly beautiful. I agree with esquire, ""...the most human film of the year"" done in stop motion animation.

Too often people equate stop motion animation with children's programing. Classics like the Will Venton Studio productions have created great young audience minded shows and movies. This film is not one of those. It tastefully uses nudity, sexuality, and graphic content but it is there. This is a film about a midlife crisis, about alienation, about loss, about life, about perhaps all of that, some of that, or none of that. Not for children, but a great stop motion film. It is artfully done showing what stop motion can potentially do in the future.

This is a film that is meaningful and powerful at the first viewing but that improves with subsequent watches. It is haunting and makes you want to spend time exploring it.

While I enjoyed the DVD and share it with my friends often, I do not like the lack of special features. This film is different than other stop motion films and a behind the scenes feature would have been nice. I've heard Charlie Kaufman discuss the film in podcasts and interviews and it would have been nice to hear from him on the DVD in some form.",1473379200,13,1205,4.647887323943662

7549754,3,B018IDVBFS,"ANALYSIS WITH SPOILERS: I guess there are many layers to the film, depending on your own filters. But what I got out of it was a statement about the male compulsion for new sexual conquests. For Michael, sex is the only bright spot in his sad, dull life.

Michael may halfheartedly try to convince himself that his desires are romance, love, fate, friendship, a soulmate situation, but they're not. As soon as he sleeps with Lisa, she's just like everybody else and not intriguing anymore--becomes annoying to him, in fact (typical cad behavior). But surely Michael isn't so naive as to think this was a meaningful encounter; he intends to have an affair with old flame Bella earlier in the evening, although his plans are foiled. Once Michael's chances with Bella are over, he is free to pursue another possibility--arriving in the form of Lisa's unique voice and face. He misinterprets ""can"" as ""should.""

Things do happen; people meet other people; people take ""breaks"" from their real life on business trips and sometimes find the person of their dreams. But remember, this isn't about romantic destiny between Lisa and Michael. This is about intentions with Bella transmuting/leading to Lisa and Michael's desperation to recreate that spark of interest in another human being.

This sexual urge (disguised as ""love"" to satisfy the female partners and family units?) is what has kept the species going through years of human suffering and ennui. But we've almost evolved past the need for it. Our world population desperately needs controlling. Sexual dalliances are kind of anachronistic and pathetic when set against the backdrop of the modern condition. Not sure this ""problem"" is original or interesting enough to carry a full-length feature film.

GENERAL REVIEW: Hmm ... Anomalisa got me thinking, but I wouldn't say I liked it or recommend it to others. The puppetry is excellent. The gender-neutral face is cleverly done, but I was distracted because the facial construction makes it look as if all the characters are wearing glasses. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan are great; I'm not sure David Thewlis was the best choice. His voice doesn't match the look of the puppet. Finally, I assume the sex scene is supposed to be serious, but I found it as laughable as the one in Team America.",1471996800,17,2304,4.976623376623377

Boring, slow story, a sex scene which added nothing to the story (it was somehow more uncomfortable to watch than a REAL sex scene would have been), various other offensive and pointless scenes and a disappointing ending. I'm not easily offended; I think Team America - World Police is hilarious. This on the other hand is meant to be taken seriously and there's just no point.",1471651200,4,576,4.712871287128713
7549756,5,B018IDVBFS,"I watched this film after reading some of the background.  So I knew that it was intentional that all the characters sounded the same except for Michael Stone and Lisa.  The name of the hotel  Fregoli  refers to a psychological condition where sufferers think everyone else is the same person in different guises.

I think many reviewers have got hung up on Michael Stones adultery, believing that films maybe should not show the truth or the seamy side of life.  I think that is a shame because the film is really about the emotional bleakness of life.  It is about how everything is much the same.  Stones role is to write books about customer service for people working in those vast call centres, where workers have to try to relate to disembodied voices and make callers feel a human connection.

It is ironic then that Stone feels nothing for anyone.  He doesnt really know who anyone is, let alone himself.  His search for a sexual connection is part of his search for meaning in his blank life.  The film shows us that his lack of connection or empathy causes real distress in the women he encounters.

The name Anomalisa is a play on the word Lisa and anomaly.  But when I thought about it, I thought that the word anomie was what it really is about.  Durkheim talked about Anomie in his work on suicide. Anomie is used to describe the lack of moral guidance given by society.  Wikipedia has a good entry on the subject.

Anomie is why we are all floundering.  Religion has lost much of its moral authority.  We can see that our political leaders get away with behavior that would be deemed criminal for the rest of us.  I found Anomalisa moving and at times upsetting, but I do feel that it is a work of art.  It is truthful, I recognized the world the film makers painted.  We live in an age of anxiety, lets be honest about that.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is thoughtful and looking for a film that is different and challenging.",1471305600,38,1956,4.463276836158192

7549786,3,B018IDVBFS,"This is an unusual movie in many ways.  First there are only 3 (voice) actors even though there are dozens of characters who speak.  Then, it was created using a combination of puppets and animation.  Michael Stone (David Thewlis) is a successful author and consultant on customer service.  Hes heading to Cincinnati for a conference where he will speak.  We see something is amiss early on as his wife along with his young son, sends him off.  They both speak with the same male voice (Tom Noonan).  In fact all of the characters Michael encounters during and after his trip have the same voice and have the same face.  Male or female.  Young or old.  Doesnt matter.  To Michael everybody looks and sounds alike.  It doesnt take a PhD to realize something is wrong.

When he reaches his hotel, which I believe is named the Fregoli, (the same as the neuropsychiatric condition) he calls an old flame who lives in town.  The breakup was evidently sudden and devastating to her, but she agrees to meet him at the hotel bar.  It doesnt go well.  Michael, obviously hoping for something new and refreshing finds her with the same face and voice as everyone else, from the cab driver to his kid.  In his hotel room, depleting his mini-bar of tiny bottles of vodka, Michael hears two people talking and what do you know, one has an actual womans voice.  He starts knocking on guest room doors until he finds two women.  One, attractive, flirtatious but with the same face and voice.  The second woman is named Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and she looks and sounds different.

After buying the ladies a couple drinks at the lobby bar, Michael invites Lisa back to his room.  Lisa is shy and hides a scar on her face with her hair.  Shes in awe of Michael for not only his book and knowledge of customer service, but that hes paying attention to her.  Things progress and yes, animated puppets have realistic body parts and yes they have sex.  To go much further in what follows may be giving too much away.  While I found the film refreshingly different, the subject matter isn't and perhaps co-director (with Duke Johnson) and writer Charlie Kaufman are trying to make that point.  Aside from watching the technical aspects of the film, I found it to be a bit underwhelming and dare I say, boring.",1469318400,3,2290,4.590123456790123
7549787,4,B018IDVBFS,"The film's plot has been explained in enough professional reviews that it shouldn't be a surprise, but in case I give away anything inadvertently, please stop reading if you're concerned about spoilers.

""Anomalisa"" is one day in the life of Michael Stone, a well-known author of business development books that focus on customer service, who has travelled to Cincinnati to give a promotional speech.  It becomes clear early on that everyone he encounters, including his wife and son on the phone, has the same voice (they're all played by Tom Noonan).  Stone is also revealed to be a serial philanderer who uses these frequent business trips to carry on affairs and hookups.  By chance, he meets an awkward, lonely (and much younger) woman with a unique voice that fascinates him.  This is ""Lisa"" of the title, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, the only character other than Stone not voiced by Noonan.

The characters are portrayed very realistically - I can imagine meeting all of these people in real life, and the interactions are entirely believable.  The overall look of the film is very engaging, as the characters are rendered in 3-D printed material resembling flannel, animated by stop-motion.  Unfortunately, the script suffers from second-act problems, bogging down in a few places in the middle where the action isn't as tight as at the beginning and end.  Probably around 15 minutes could have been cut, but at an hour and a half, the film is already at the minimum length for a major release.  The gimmick of everyone having the same voice also starts to wear thin after a while, although there really wasn't any way for the writers to abandon it without creating confusion.

And while the idea of a man who engages in serial adultery on business trips was presented in a wholly believable manner - Stone is portrayed as drifting from one unsatisfying and upsetting (to the women) affair to another - it's clear that his wife has no idea he is doing this, or at least, if she knows, they don't have an honestly open marriage with this understanding.  One possible interpretation of everyone having the same voice is that Stone sees everyone he meets as interchangeable, existing only to fulfill his desires of the moment.  His transcendent encounter with Lisa (really just a folie--deux from his end) is nothing more than a repetition of what he's experienced with all of the other women he's encountered in the past.  Stone comes across as somewhat predatory - he prefers to target lonely, unstable, vulnerable women with low self-esteem, who tend to have trouble with relationships; he convinces himself that they're soulmates, then tires of them and moves on.  He'd do far less damage hooking up with types like Samantha from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B00H8KC1OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;at the hotel bar, who are there for that purpose, or even just calling a local escort service.

Honestly, you'd have to be living under a rock to not be able to figure out what this man's problem is.  He is so narcissistic, it's hard to stomach.  Hard to understand the point of the film unless it's to show you how sick someone's life can get when they are so wrapped up in themselves and pleasing only themselves and satisfying their own desires.  He looks down on everyone, including his own 8 yr old son.  The only people who hold any interest for him at all in this film are two women, one from his past, and one he just met, that he hopes to have sex with.  He succeeds with one, but the love affair for this married man is very short lived when the following morning, he starts seeing her as ""human"" and perceives her normalcy as ""flaws.""  She gets on his nerves for talking, momentarily, with her mouth open while eating, and he loses interest in her and she immediately drops to the same ""loser"" status, in his eyes, as everyone else in his world.  I don't have time for sick ""entertainment"" like this.  Don't listen to the reviewers.  They need to keep their job and are too intimidated to depart from what the majority of other reviewers are saying about this film.  It really stinks.

At first the main character had a male partner at home, likewise the old flame when she answers the phone I assumed was her husband, but females, kids everyone have the same voice. It really is a slow and boring film, we have a tedious and annoying conversation with a chatty taxi driver, then a long drawn out check in at the hotel and conversation with a bellboy who like the main character you just wanted to be over. The dullness continues throughout though, there's a few sex scenes, a bit of crude humour, but none of it is entertaining. If this was done with real actors you'd rate it one star, just because someone has put in a great amount of time creating stop motion puppet animation characters doesn't give it a free rating pass to me.

7549874,3,B018IDVBFS,"I had been waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year.  My wife and I live in rural America, and had to wait for it to come out on DVD.  Let me first say that the animation was, to me, mostly spectacular.  The way that the rooms were constructed, the way the clothes folded in all the right places, down to the freaking pattern on her underwear! were all spectacular.  The little details really sold the show.

The story is where I was lost.  It centers around an author (Michael Stone) who has written a book about customer service and is town to give a speech about it.  We learn that he is not happy with his home life, and that he is appearing to do well mentally.  The movie focuses on a, what seems, 24 hour period, so there are a lot of background details that are left out.  These are filled in peripherally, but as a viewer we're still left hanging on some details.

It seems as if Michael's life has turned to s***, at the least it's become monotonous and boring.  After a time, though, we start to see that maybe there's something wrong with Michael mentally.  His night in town is not going well until he meets two of his fans.  They end up going out for drinks and then he hooks up with one.  Even she isn't enough for him, though, and ultimately he ends up going back to his old life.

I found this movie to be depressing, which is alright because sometimes life is depressing.  However, there was nothing to root for here, which made it difficult to continue watching.  All-in-all, I was pretty disappointed in this movie.  Maybe it would be different if I hadn't waited for 6 months to see it, but it's one that I'm glad I didn't buy.",1465862400,2,1660,4.266025641025641

7549893,5,B018IDVBFS,"What is it like when you feel like you have lost that spark, that special something when you fell in love?  What is it like to ache for a connection to someone, even if you have a family and friends?  What is it like to feel so down, so depressed that everyone you meet, everyone you know, seems the same?  Many of us know the answer to that question.

Michael Stone is a semi-famous author of books on how to help improve sales.  He's heading to a convention in Cincinnati.  Lisa Hesselman is attending the conference.  She works at a call center.  Michael feels sad, aching, longing for a connection, missing something he can't put into words.  His family seems bland, his life seems bland.  Lisa is incredibly self-effacing and insecure, though, in a way, she knows who she is and accepts it.

The scenes between the two are awkward, funny, painful, and very real.  The movements and dialogue seem very natural.

The movie is made using ""stop motion"" animation puppets.  I think, somehow, they made the film more real but I can't explain why.

But I can say if you've ever had a brief and powerful connection with someone, if you've ever longed for someone, if you've ever wondered if there is someone out there for you, if you've ever wondered ""is this all there is for the rest of my life?"" in other words, if you are a human being, then this film will probably be an incredibly moving experience for you.

I found this very distracting even though I understand it was intended to be a crucial aspect to the plot. The movie just didn't seem to go anywhere for me.

SPOILEES
This darkly humorous story is about the crushing mundanity of life, in this case felt by a depressed (and possibly alcoholic) middle-aged adultering author in a dead-end marriage. A man going through the motions to get through the day. Everyones faces and voices being the same is the visualization of that mundanity, from HIS perspective. Everyone else is the ""other"" he doesn't relate to, he feels like an anomaly in this world of sameness. This is why when he meets (Anoma)Lisa, his world is brightened, he's found another anomaly he can relate to, and it's beautiful to him. But once she is around for awhile and he sobers up, he starts noticing her flaws. Her beauty fades and she loses that special newness, and I think we can all relate to feeling that way about someone at some point, albeit not so quick. I speculate that the dislike of Michael is because of his relatability, as his portrayal is unflinchingly honest and human, it shows us parts of ourselves that most may want to ignore, although that's not to say there aren't funny and heartwarming parts as well. The rest of the movie is pretty straightforward, just my two cents.",1464393600,7,1433,4.732

In a movie industry so hell-bent on profit at the expense of originality Kaufman is one of the few who appears to want to do more than simply line his pockets by whatever means necessary. ""Anomalisa"" is not a particularly complicated film in terms of plot: the story is straightforward enough - an author and motivational speaker on a business trip meets a woman who, with a friend, has come to see him deliver a talk on the topic of customer service. When compared to the intricacies of ""Adaptation"" or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" this is a threadbare plot. Kaufman substitutes mood for narrative complexity, giving us a glimpse into the unfolding, creeping mental dissolution of the antagonist - Micheal Stone, voiced by David Thewlis, most notably of the wonderful film ""Naked"" where he gave a magnificent and powerful performance - and the damage that this breakdown has caused in the lives of those with whom he comes into contact. The hotel where Stone stays the night is a reference to the mental disorder from which he suffers - the belief that all the individuals a person encounters are really just one person in disguise. This is enhanced by the voices of the characters - each of which is practically indistinguishable from one another throughout most of the film. In its own way ""Anomalisa"" is a small triumph of a film in a world of bombastic comic book superheroes and vapid sequels. The climax of the film, such as it is, dissolves into the mundane world of encroaching suburban insanity into which Stone will sink. It is not happy nor particularly sad but lies in an ambiguous nether region between the two. Kaufman is aware of audience expectation and he almost seems to shrug his shoulders with indifference at the desire for a resolution that wraps up the story neatly and allows for some emotional catharsis. We are left adrift, watching from above as Stone - in his home surrounded by party guests - is left to his own crumbling devices.

OK, I get that this was first of its kind, creative, bold, edgy whatever. But when you make a movie you should actually have a story to tell and not just rely on the really cool look-at-what-I-can-do effects to keep your audience.

Sure, there are the uber hib critics that profess their love and admiration for such genius, but I think it is more group-think than anything else. They don't want to be seen as out of it or unintellectual if they don't fall all over themselves about it.

I am not worried about anyone questioning my intellect or my taste so I will give my honest opinion. It was a poor movie because it did not entertain, stimulate thought, or draw me in to empathize with the characters. I didn't care about these people (puppets?) except maybe a little bit for Lisa. She was able to stay cheerful in the face of the unrelenting joyless world that the movie created. But in the end I didn't give two hoots what happened to her.

The ending was such a letdown I'm still mad/depressed after 2 days. That's not what I want a movie to do!

7550024,5,B018IDVBFS,"Michel is a man that craves closeness and longs to meet the other. But the other for him is a generic, boring, insignificant repetition of the same--same face, same voice, same canned content devoid of real emotion and affect (apart from some aggression).  Maybe the other cannot connect with him, but certainly he cannot connect with the other.
To be honest, it is not only his fault, or the consequence of his narcissism. He lives in a commodified world, where even human relationships are designed to optimize productivity and consumption.  Not only people in the service industry design their interactions to a T to increase productivity and sales, but every person, every consumer unbeknownst to himself repeats a script of what is deemed to be important and valuable.  Even the (adorable!) taxi driver repeats a commodified script of what is important to see in Cincinnati: the zoo and the chili.

It is not only the internal problem of the individual, of Mike and his psyche; it is a larger scale problem, where places, experiences, and people have lost their uniqueness; they are items to be consumed or exploited. Michael is only the identified symptom of a larger plague. Michael sharply sees the ugliness of it all and exploits it.  Indeed, he is an expert on marketing and communication and is an acclaimed spoke person on this topic.  But his alienation and his awareness of the alienated world brings hopelessness and disillusionment; he does not fall for the canned attention and courtesy of the concierge and the bell boy.  He rather avoids this empty communication. But he still craves for contact.  But any alterity is experienced like chalk on the board.  He cannot experience difference and needs to dull life and homogenize his experience.  This goes on to the point of madness.  Then he hears a voice, a disembodied presence that he perceives as different and exciting, a female voice that pierces his protective bubble and offers hope for a new beginning. Will he be able to accept otherness? Will he be able to connect and love? Will he be able to develop psychologically and find a more suitable position from which to experience the world?",1460592000,10,2165,4.904109589041096

The worst part is that almost the entire movie is filled with a male voice and literally ONE female voice is heard the whole time. I guess that's supposed to be the whole plot (without saying any spoilers) but I expect more from filmmakers in the 21st century. I want more female voices. Literally.

7550085,5,B018IDVBFS,"Before writing the full review, here's a shorter one for those who don't want to read: To me this movie is a fantastic look at a man who is having a midlife crisis, as well as a relationship between two damaged people. I will warn now that if you're not into the very intricate details of how Kaufman does this, this movie will probably not be for you.

Here's the full review: Charlie Kaufman has once again created a beautiful movie, not only with his writing and story, but also visually with the help of Duke Johnson, a known claymation animator. They combine their efforts to make a stunningly beautiful claymation feature,  with tireless efforts to make the characters and surroundings look real, as well as an amazing character piece and romance story as well.

The movie focuses on Michael Stone, a famous customer service rep who goes to Cincinnati to speak at a conference. Michael is currently having doubts about his life, however, and is suffering a midlife crisis, when he meets Lisa, and a connection forms.

This film expertly shows how Stone perceives people, and without spoiling it, it is something you have to pick up on. It may seem confusing at first, but it begins to make more sense as the film continues. It also tells a beautiful story between Lisa and Michael, two damaged people who form a connection from their problems. Kaufman's script is fantastic as always, and doesn't always blatantly say what everything means, but instead lays clues to pick up on amazingly. The voice acting as also great, with the actors and actress giving as much emotion through their voice as if they were in a live action movie.

Duke Johnson also animated one of the most beautiful claymation movies ever, with detail so great to characters and their movements, actions, and facial expressions, as well as high attention to detail. There is a specific scene where you are able to see the reflection of a person through another's eyes, and it so real it's amazing. This animation makes it feel just as if actors were actually in the movie acting, and makes it seem human.

Overall, this movie is one of the most realistic and human movies I've ever seen. Everything excels to the best it can be, with a great script and story, animation, and voice acting. It is very serious and one you have to pay very close attention to, and since a lot of meaning is shown through clues in the writing (no spoilers, but I didn't pick up on everything until the second time around), it will definitely not be a movie for everyone. But if you have enjoyed past Kaufman written and directed films, or enjoy movies concerning human relationships in intricate ways, this is the movie for you.

P.S.: For the people saying this movie's sex scene is a joke or makes the movie pornographic, either grow up or understand that the scene exists to show the deep relationship felt between the people involved. Its so focused on that scene because they are showing they are making love, not just having sex, and that's why so much detail is put into it. It also took months to actually shoot properly, so if you can't accept it on an emotional level, at least appreciate it on a technical level.",1458345600,3,3178,4.644128113879003

7550091,4,B018IDVBFS,"There's simply no easy way to describe Anomalisa, which shouldn't come as a surprise considering it springs from the mind of Charlie Kaufman whose films are never easy to pin down. As the brilliant brain behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, and Synecdoche, New York, Kaufman has indulged in the romantic, the bizarre, and the somber, but no matter what his films are always enlightening even if they aren't always engaging.

Funny then that the stop-motion animated Anomalisa would find Kaufman connecting on his most human level yet, considering it's a film entirely about one man's lack of human connection.  Paired up with Duke Johnson, Kaufman's kooky genius is matched with a unique visual and narrative style that guarantees nobody will confuse it with other stop-motion films. For one thing, none can lay claim to having one of the strangest and most fascinating cunnilingus scenes ever captured on the big screen.

David Thewlis voices Michael Stone, a lonely author in the field of customer service who heads to Cincinnati for a one-day conference. If being an expert in the field of customer service seems like a bore, then it goes double for Stone who is one of those classic Kaufman ""sad sack"" characters disillusioned with life as a whole. While married and with a son, Stone is clearly unhappy and sees this trip as a desperate opportunity to reach out to a past love that he left on bad terms. But it's not that simple, of course. Stone is one of those people who cringe at the banality of casual small talk. He chaffs at the idea of human interaction, which makes this conference where he's kind of a celebrity, a living nightmare.

That anyone could be a celebrity in the field of customer service is just one of the oddities Kaufman explores, just as it's weird to have someone who is generally dissatisfied with life in a business all about satisfying others. But the film is titled Anomalisa for a reason; Stone eventually meets a shy woman named Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) who turns his life around. He finds her extreme lack of self-confidence oddly charming. He calls her an anomaly because she stands out from the other dull people in his life, which is funny because she's completely plain in every way.  She's his ""Anomalisa"", and the two find comfort in the grueling, antiseptic Hellholes that are business hotels where everyone is just a little too eager to please.

It's in the exploration of that last aspect where Kaufman and Johnson may lose some viewers as it devolves into a twisted Twin Peaks-esque landscape. But then there's a surreal quality to all of it, especially in the casting of Tom Noonan to voice every character that isn't Stone or Lisa, and that includes females. As a representation of the film's central theme of life's mundanity it may seem a little too direct, especially since little else is spelled out as pointedly.  But underneath all of the absurdity is a gentle humor that has been missing from Kaufman lately. Kaufman genuinely seems to be having fun poking at humanity's silly quirks again, and animation has given him the proper platform for embracing his lighter side. Anomalisa may be too idiosyncratic for some to deal with; it can be as exhilarating as it can be uncomfortable. But such is life, and if it were any other way that would be pretty darn mundane.",1455667200,7,3378,4.813793103448276

7550113,2,B018IDVBFS,"Directed by Duke Johnson (Mary Shelley's Frankenhole) and Charlie Kaufman (Synecdoche, New York) from a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich), Anomalisa is a strange film, and to be honest, a difficult film to like. The animation is reminiscent of a certain style of video game meant to be semi-realistic seeming, and the story amounts to watching a not overly sympathetic character in the throes of a mid-life crisis go through what feels like a nervous breakdown.

Michael Stone (David Thewlis) is flying to Cincinnati where he's to give a speech at a conference on business customer relations, a field in which he's written a book and is recognized as something of an expert. There he checks into a hotel where, after attempting to re-connect with an old flame that he hasn't spoken to in ten years, he ends up meeting a girl named Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) with whom he feels a spark of some kind that prompts him to invite her for a drink. More than that I can't say as it would amount to a spoiler. Though in truth there's not much to spoil in this film.

That said, we come to a minor spoiler alert. Please skip this paragraph if you want to avoid spoilers of any kind. --- Yes, this is an animated film, but not all animated films are meant for children and this is definitely one of those. Aside from the adult themes and generally depressing tone, there is animated sex. Dreary animated sex. If you can't spare yourself, at least spare your kids. Spoiler alert ends. Continue reading in safety.

Another oddity about Anomalisa is that there are only three voice actors in the film. David Thewlis (The Theory of Everything, the Harry Potter movies) was the voice of Michael, the main character. Jennifer Jason Leigh (The Hateful Eight, Dolores Claiborne) was the voice of Lisa, the girl he meets and has an encounter with. And Tom Noonan (Synecdoche, New York & The Last Action Hero) was all of the other voices in the film. All of them - male, female, old, young - all of them. And all were recognizably the same voice. The purpose might have been to underscore Michael's inability to make meaningful connections with people because they mostly all sounded the same to him, but the effect was more puzzling and distracting than anything else.

The film length is only 90 minutes but it feels like it's much longer, probably because after a certain point I was just waiting and waiting for it to finally be over. A sharp contrast to both The Revenant and The Hateful Eight which were over two and a half hours each but felt shorter.

On a side note, the musical score by Carter Burwell (Fargo, True Grit), while well-done aesthetically, only seemed to enhance the tedium and dreariness that pervaded what was happening on the screen. Which in most cases is the purpose of the musical score but here it felt like it was only adding to the film's problems.

7550115,1,B018IDVBFS,"I really wanted to like this movie.  It looked beautiful, the story sounded wonderful, and I was thoroughly impressed by the amount of work that went into the making of this film.

Upon watching it, however, the story was not quite what I expected.  It was slow to start, but I don't have a problem with that as long as the payoff is worthwhile.  I don't even have a problem with the nudity (#puppetjunk).  What I have a major problem with is the predatory nature with which the main character treated his two love interests.  I gathered from some other reviews that the audience is supposed to laugh at his narcissistic/neurotic behavior, but I found that hard to do when his behavior was effectively being celebrated (in that it worked on Lisa.  Thank god Bella walked out).  But schadenfreude is not my brand of humor, anyway.

I also stopped watching just before the sex scene, so I might've missed the payoff.  But the other reviews don't seem to indicate that.",1454630400,9,966,4.629411764705883

The movie, however, had one redeeming virtue: I will NEVER take critics literally again and rely on my own feelings about a trailer. The trailer makes this animated film seem like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with hallmark card dialogue but this is a lamentable bait and switch. It is a downer that has the pacing of paint drying.",1454457600,2,597,4.97

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Charlie Kaufmann, principally known for Being John Malklovich and Adapation, is back with the very strange Anomalisa, which is based on an earlier stage play of his. Kaufmann raised almost $500,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to fund a film that features marionettes that come to life via stop-motion animation. The two principal characters--Michael Stone, a self-help motivational speaker, and an insecure woman named Lisa whom Michael meets at a hotel--are voiced by David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh. However, the visual models for the principals are based on non- actors Kaufmann discovered outside the usual casting process.

The story begins with Michael arriving in Cincinnati and checking in at the ""Fregoli Hotel."" This is a reference to the Fregoli delusion, or the delusion of doubles, which (as Wikipedia informs us), ""is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise."" Indeed, throughout the film, except for Lisa (the woman for whom he falls head over heels for), everyone else has the same male voice and face (voiced by Tom Noonan).

Michael's particular delusion suggests that he is both paranoid and narcissistic, unable to form normal relationships with anyone. He calls up an old girlfriend, Bella, and invites her to meet him downstairs at the hotel bar. When he invites her upstairs to his room (presumably for sex), Bella is outraged and storms out.

On the way to the hotel, Michael had asked the cab driver where he could find a toy store that was open late, in order to get a present for his son. The driver inadvertently gives him directions to an adult toy store where Michael ends up purchasing a Japanese animatronic woman (the significance of which escapes me).

Michael then has a paranoid fit, knocking on all the doors on his floor in the hotel, looking for a ""friend"" who he believes has been looking for him. Instead, two women answer one of the doors he knocks onand one of the women, Lisa, has her own distinct face and voice. Here Michael finally connects with someone, confirmed by her unique appearance.

Michael invites Lisa to his room where she reveals she's insecure, especially about a facial scar that she conceals with her hair. But Michael is captivated and is even more thrilled when she begins singing her own rendition of Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun."" The two then have sex in a fairly graphic scene, not usually seen in films featuring animated marionettes.

In perhaps the best scene in the film, Michael has a nightmare where part of his face falls off in the hotel hallway and then is pursued by all the identical people who claim they love him and beg for him not to fall in love with Lisa. When he eats breakfast with Lisa, he can't stand the sounds she makes while eating and hears everyone else's voice over hers. The paranoia reaches its apex when Michael gives his motivational speech at a convention center and begins ranting about US government conspiraciesthe audience there is clearly turned off.

When Michael returns home to his family in Los Angeles, his breakdown is complete. He can no longer recognize the guests at a surprise birthday party his wife has thrown for him and becomes blankly absorbed with the Japanese animatronic woman which his son had no interest in as a birthday present. However, in the final scene, Lisa is driving in a car, sitting with her friend, who now has her own face.

The irony Kaufmann appears to be conveying is that here is a self- help speaker that the corporate world puts up on a pedestal, who falls into his own world of self-delusion and is unable to motivate himself in any positive way. But Kaufmann doesn't only want us to laugh at Stonein a sense he also wants us to laugh at his delusions, which represent the foibles of a neurotic and narcissistic society. If you buy into his critique, then you must accept all the frustrated characters that make up Stone's world: a taxicab driver, for example, who deceives himself that his small-talk is truly worthwhile; a robotic bellhop who must be overly pleasing just to get a tip; an office worker masturbating in front of an open window, inviting voyeuristic onlookers; an ex- girlfriend who holds a grudge and can't get over her anger from a breakup long ago; and even a seemingly normal woman who is held back due to insecurities over physical appearance.

Kaufmann isn't completely negative about social intercoursethe world outside of everyman Stone and his delusions, can be optimisticLisa's friend at the end is no longer a figment of Stone's warped consciousness. Kaufmann's quirk-fest, where he turns neurosis into farce, is occasionally clever but decidedly lightweight. Don't expect to laugh too hard here unless scoffing at a superficial conception of humankind's cluelessness is your thing.",1454198400,2,4957,4.889285714285714

7550119,4,B018IDVBFS,"""Anomalisa"" (2015 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis). As the movie opens, we see Michael arriving from LA at the Cincinnati airport, as he's scheduled to give a presentation on customer service the next  day. Michael checks in in his hotel in downtown Cincinnati, and after a disastrous rendez-vous at the hotel bar with his ex, Michael eventually makes the acquaintance of Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Emily, two women who drove down from Akron for his talk. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is the latest brainchild of Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich; Adaptation; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, etc.), and to state that he is pretty unique in the movie business would be an understatement. I'll go see anything that this guy comes up with, yes, he is that unique (and that good). Here, he takes yet another direction, spinning a story of a loner, and presenting it in stop-motion fashion. On top of that, other than the two main characters having their own unique voice, all the other characters, both make and female, are voiced by the same person (Tom Noonan). Even though the two settings couldn't be more different (Tokyo vs. Cincinnati), the movie made me think more than once about Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" (including the themes of loneliness and self-doubt). Beware, even though this is stop-motion, there are several scenes with explicit nudity, so if that bothers you... Last but not least, there is a very nice orchestral score for this movie, courtesy of Carter Burwell.  And then there is the a-cappela version of Cindy Lauper's ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" by the Lisa character...

The movie opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not as well as I had expected. Given the multiple Cincinnati references in the film (down to Cincinnati chili), there were quite a few laughs and reactions from the audience during the showing. That aside, if you like Charlie Kaufman and all of the weirdness that entails (in the best possible way), you cannot go wrong with this. ""Anomalisa"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1453593600,10,2374,4.868811881188119
7550120,5,B018IDVBFS,"1. Charlie Kaufman, responsible for writing blindingly original and strange movies like Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Adaptation, has reappeared after a 7-year absence by writing and co-directing this odd and beautiful allegory.

2. The fewer details you know about the story beforehand, the better. It's designed to slowly reveal what's going on, and you'll get the most out of it that way.

3. The basic plot is about a self-help author who is so deeply unhappy with his life that his brain is re-interpreting reality for him. Then he meets an unhappy woman, and the results are... interesting.

4. This is an animated movie, but it's made for adults. There's swearing, nudity, sex, and alcohol.

5. The foundation of the movie is very melancholy, but it's also extremely funny in parts.

6. It's made with stop-motion animation, but it moves much more smoothly than most of those type of films. The puppets were created using 3D printers. The results are fascinating and a little unsettling.

7. Even though it's surreal and trippy, it manages to hit on an essential Truth about life that may not have been able to be explained in any other way.

8. If you need movies with definite events and concrete explanations, then you will want to avoid this movie.

9. This movie is one of those rare specimens that you understand deep inside yourself, but you may have trouble finding the words to explain it. It's a remarkable piece of art.",1453507200,126,1472,4.813492063492063
7550121,5,B018IDVBFS,Fantastic.  I had been waiting for 4 years for this movie to release and it was well worth the wait.  The plot is as intricate as the animation which is astounding.,1453248000,6,164,4.258064516129032
7550122,4,B018IDVBFS,"This is some of the best stop animation ever. The puppets are beautifully put together, and their gestures and motion are wonderfully natural. There's one self-conscious moment - yes these really are puppets - but that's more acknowledgement than self-parody. Five stars, maybe six, for the everything that makes this animation work.

Then there's the plot - somewhat dark, even a bit disturbing. The lead character, a motivational speaker, enters the crisis point of a mid-life crisis, without realizing that's what's happening. In his own fragile state, he seduces a woman even more emotionally fragile than he is. She exits the brief affair reasonably happy, despite his thoroughly questionable behavior towards her.

And yes, there's the sex scene. Different viewers will respond differently to it - despite its realism in many ways, I found that the dolls dampened any eroticism I might have seen, like two manikins posed intimately together. In any case, this is definitely not one for the kiddies.

And, even though the animation bordered on magical, the emotional burden is not one I really enjoyed seeing.
