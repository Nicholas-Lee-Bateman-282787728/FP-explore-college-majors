6444553,1,B00KRGYESG,Who sells a Blu-ray movie in stereo sound.  A HUGE waste of money!!!!,1421539200,5,69,4.3076923076923075
6444554,1,B00KRGYESG,"While these are both good action movies (and even a good who done it in the case of Basic), this set is a rip off. While the pictures are HD, the sound is basic stereo (not surround 5.1), and there are no special features whatsoever. Indeed, even the common feature that allows for dialog to also be printed on the screen is not there. This package was a bad idea that earns money for the seller and shortchanges the purchaser.",1420675200,5,427,4.35
6444555,4,B00KRGYESG,Very good just did not wantSWAT,1419379200,,31,4.333333333333333
6444556,1,B00KRGYESG,"What a disappointment this disc turned out to be. Stereo sound only on both titles and no extras. Don't waste your money on this rubbish. Mill Creek, you've lost my business.",1409184000,6,174,4.645161290322581
6444557,1,B00KRGYESG,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray version. Don't waste your money. There are no special features and only stereo sound. Absolutely unacceptable for a Blu-Ray. I love the movie ""Basic"" but wish I had not wasted my money on this disc.",1408579200,11,230,4.5
6444558,5,B00KRGYESG,Enjoyed both movies and wanted to add them to my collection.,1456012800,,60,4.545454545454546
6444559,5,B00KRGYESG,"I love Basic but my DVD copy (which is one movie on one disc) was not letting me see the jungle hurricane scenes very well because the scenes were too dark.  So I thought I would get this double feature on blu-ray with two movies on one disc, at a great Mill Creek price.
I was NOT disappointed because Basics jungle scenes were so much easier to see.  Also, I thought S.W.A.T. looked good.",1454025600,,390,4.256756756756757
6444560,5,B00KRGYESG,Don't remember the movie basic but the movie swat is great I definite must buy fun to watch even 10 years later better than renting it so you can watch it over and over again and at a great price,1451692800,,195,3.9
6444561,1,B00KRGYESG,This was a great disappointment for me since i enjoy the high definition audio of bluray movies just as much as the visuals. Stereo sound (L & R) only on both titles. It wouldn't have killed them to make two discs one for each movie with lossless audio tracks. Boo.,1449705600,,265,4.32

8660984,3,B00KRGYESG,"Great movie... years ago I bought the DVD of these movies, they had 5.1 sound. I bought this for the 1080p quality but these are only 2 channel... What happened...? I would not buy this if you are like me and want the HD experience...",1528416000,,234,4.222222222222222
8660985,1,B00KRGYESG,There are no subtitles for those of us hard of hearing and the sound was terrible. My stereo system was up almost full blast and some of the quieter scenes I couldn't understand at all. This double feature is barely worth the free Prime shipping.,1516579200,,246,4.488888888888889

8660992,4,B00KRGYESG,"I purchased these movies before - as part of the three movie set (with Formula 51). Problem was that set of videos were all full-screen (1.33:1) and I've been wanting the widescreen Blu-ray versions. For the price I'm happy with this double feature set. But it is pretty bare-bones. Both movies are on one disc. There are no special / extra features, just the movies. There is just the one audio track (2 channel stereo). No close-captioning. No menu or chapter stops. Still, the widescreen 1080p picture is excellent, which is all I really care about. Of the two movies, I think I like S.W.A.T. the best, but Basic is one of my favourite mystery movies. Together they make for a good double-feature.",1467417600,,700,4.699186991869919
