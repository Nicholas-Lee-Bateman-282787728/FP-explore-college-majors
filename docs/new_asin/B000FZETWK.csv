2593259,4,B000FZETWK,"This is only the second dvd I have gotten in ""The Firm"" series.  Much better than expected after the first.  Easy to follow instructions, good descriptions of the moves you are doing, works the entire body evenly.  Allison's personality could warm up a touch but she is not annoying or too perky.  Felt like I got a good cardio workout afterwards.  Good warm up and good cool down.  Like the fact that they actually have a stretching segment for the lower half of the body.  Just wish they would allot more time with the existing stretches and add a couple upper body stretches for the arms.  Would definately recommend.",1159315200,4,620,4.623853211009174
2593260,4,B000FZETWK,"Ultimate Fat Burning is not quite the ""ultimate"" in cardio, but does deliver a solid intermediate workout.

The workout is led by Alison Davis. The set is sterile, with four background exercisers. The music is non-intrusive and forgettable. Alison cues pretty well, and I had no trouble following along. There's no fancy footwork, no plyos, no step bench, and no heavy weights used.

The workout itself starts off kind of boring and repetitive, and through the first two-thirds I was thinking that I wouldn't be doing this workout very often. But then we got to the kickboxing segment, and I started to have fun. I never felt like I was getting a particularly intense workout, but I was sweating and my heartrate was somewhat elevated. But as soon as I started to get into it, we were cooling down. Another fifteen minutes of cardio would have been great.

We cooled down with some interesting ab work, done standing, and some stretches that felt really good (but were too short). I don't have any complaints with this workout, other than it should be longer. I didn't care for the first couple of segments, but I think after doing it a couple more times I could warm up to it. It is not an advanced workout by any means. In fact, it would be difficult to ""heavy up"" to make it advanced. But still, if you want a short (40 minutes) cardio routine that uses light weights, this is the one for you.",1158883200,10,1396,4.553784860557769
2593261,5,B000FZETWK,I usually do step aerobic workouts but needed something to give my knees a rest.  I viewed this on the couch before doing it and was unimpressed.  It did not look challenging at all.  Then I actually did the workout yesterday.  I have never sweat so much doing floor aerobics.  My rear is sore from the lunges (a good thing!)  I recently ordered a Cathe video which should arrive shortly but now I'm thinking I'm not quite ready for that.  I thought The Firm had gotten too easy for me but apparently not judging by the bucket of sweat I poured out upon my first use of this video.,1157673600,8,581,4.275229357798165
2593262,5,B000FZETWK,"The Firm bring us another good workout.  They've been in the business for so long now, and they keep making quality workouts that help burn fat.  This one is almost 45 minutes and it's effective and will have you sweating.

This is intense and it combines aerobic exercise with weighted toning.  It uses the Firms four limb movements - where you might do lunges with alternating bicep curls to maximise the burn.  The instructor is Alison Davis and she is professional and a good cuer so you know what to do next and almost don't have to look at the TV.  You will need some weights for this, and that's about it.  If I were to pick one thing I didn't like about this workout, it would be that the stretch is too short.  If you are like me, you might go ahead and continue stretching even after this has finished, but overall, it's a good exercise dvd that will give you good results.",1155945600,27,883,4.341463414634147

2593265,5,B000FZETWK,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,3,1486,4.427007299270073

2593267,5,B000FZETWK,I reviewed this dvd and I really like the 4 limb movements that are done through out this dvd. The choreography looks uncomplicated yet I feel like I would get a really good workout. What I like most about the firm workout dvds is I don't have to worry about getting injured trying to execute some outlandish move to get fit.,1421280000,,325,4.344262295081967
2593268,5,B000FZETWK,"I love this workout.  I add the firm tape ""Body Sculpting Basics"" floor exercises to this video so I can do toning exercises on the floor as an added bonus to this great workout video. I find this routine easy to follow and low impact which is great for me because I have a bad knee.  This workout routine is definitely not boring and I enjoy doing it on a regular basis. As far as the newer Firm workout videos go, this one is my favourite!",1418601600,,441,4.116279069767442

You definitely have to learn the moves before you start to get into it, but after that, its a workout you will use everyday and it burns the fat as well as strengthens your heart. The moves can be a little complicated but just go through it slowly at your own pace until you feel comfortable with doing the whole thing because all of the moves are repeated. Once you tackle that the workout is fun and really gets you motivated. Try it people!",1402444800,,507,4.404255319148936

2593273,5,B000FZETWK,"I saw Alison Davis's ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout"" on-demand years ago. I thought it was great and I memorized a few of the exercises for me to do on my own. The day after Christmas in 2013, I decided to buy this, my first workout DVD, as I wanted to take advantage of my limited-time two-day free shipping offer.

I first attempted the workout on December 30, 2013, the day it arrived in the mail. I was forced to stop it because I had to tend to family duties. On New Year's Day 2014, I did the whole 40-minute workout right after breakfast to get the New Year started off right. Alison is a friendly instructor who wants everybody to do their best as they work out with her. Her exercises had me sweating! I felt very good once I finished the workout. Yes, I'm a male and I find this workout effective for both men and women. It's a good thing I did this workout shirtless (my usual preference) because I was sweating bullets. I had the fan on full blast and I wore shorts instead of my wintertime sweat pants. This is a very effective workout and I recommend it to all people, male and female. I can't wait to do this workout again and again and again!",1388534400,,1157,4.259090909090909
2593274,2,B000FZETWK,"I've been doing the Firm videos for 11, almost 12 years, and most of the time I love them. I still workout to the ones I bought way back in 2001 that are on VHS. They usually have really challenging exercises that won't tie you up in knots and/or have beginner options. Though I'm not a beginner, obviously, but I'm 40+, and some days my knees can't handle the advanced moves, but most of the time I do the regular, unmodified exercises.

And I'm not one of these people who's looking for an EASY workout at all. I love the Biggest Loser videos - both those with Jillian Michaels and Bob what's his name, and I used to exercise 90 minutes/day - (and sometimes 90 minutes on the treadmill), and those aren't easy. I went to California Fitness - now L.A. Fitness for 3-4 years and worked out with a trainer there and took spinning/kickboxing, etc. So, I'm not slacker or a novice.

That said, while these fast-paced exercises in Allysn's cardio video that incorporate a lot of dance moves will get your heart rate going, but Allyson goes too fast and switches from one exercise to the next too quickly. I found her hard to follow. I'll get one move down after 2-3 reps, and BAM, she's on to another. And she doesn't do like most of the firm instructors like Emily Walsh (or is it Welsh?) and Alli DelRio (who's also in this video) where you'll start out doing 8 reps of an exercise, and then switch and only do 4, then 3, then 2. I can handle that. Even Alli DelRio looks like she's struggling to keep up, on occasion in this video.

Plus, a good bit of the time Allison isn't doing anything that's really new. They're all moves and various exercise that ALL the other Firm instructors have done before. And most trainers say it's better to incorporate different moves that target different muscles or that challenge your muscles in a different way, but there wasn't much of that going on in this video...sorry.

I'll pass. I'll be tossing this one in the giveaway basket for Goodwill - or maybe try to sell it in my next yard sale. At least it wasn't expensive.

2593275,5,B000FZETWK,"This is one of my all time favorite workouts. It's under 45 minutes, yet manages to give the whole body a great workout! The cueing is excellent and the moves and music are pretty fun. Although I like The Firm videos in general, this one is definitely my go-to workout. My only complaint is that the stretching segment is very short, so I usually do a little extra stretching on my own.",1371859200,,386,4.375

2593278,5,B000FZETWK,"I must say, I didn't know if the video would deliver it's promise to see results in ten sessions. Then I realized the EVERYTHING usually works if you follow the instructions and hold up your end of the bargain. After three sessions I could feel myself becoming stronger and gaining endurance--which turns up the dial on your level of confidence. People were asking me what I was doing after only two weeks because they noticed my body trimming up. Since weights are involved I decided not to weigh myself every week, so I just took my measurements. Inches were just peeling off!!! I'm happy to say that I've lost over 30 lbs., and several inches! I'm stronger than I've been in a LONG time.

March 18, 2013 UPDATE: Although I've seen HUGE results, I still have The Firm workouts in rotation. I workout at least three times a week with them. I am in the best shape of my life. I can't scream their praises enough.",1349049600,3,912,4.493975903614458

2593280,4,B000FZETWK,I have been using The Firm videos for almost ten years. Allison is by far one of my favorite intructors. (Allie is my other favorite).  This is a good cardio workout. The sculpting part is very minimum but sometimes you need a break from that. As other customers have pointed out ....the camera work stinks.  I have noticed that a little bit on other Firm videos. It is not the instructors fault. It is camera people not understanding what we need to see at a particular time of the video. This one seems to focus too much on Sue Mi (who is useless in every Firm production I have ever done) The camera person is on Sue Mi when Allison is doing a new move so it is hard to see what the instructor is doing but after one time through it you can predict what is being done. It is almost as if they made an arrangement to focus more on Sue Mi. Allison refers to her way too much and the camera is on her too much. Wish she wasn't in any of the Firm productions. I really do like this Firm production.  The plyometrics kick butt but at the same time it is a video you can do even when you dread exercising. I would give it  more stars if the camera work was better.,1330732800,,1161,4.078947368421052
2593281,5,B000FZETWK,"I tried this video about a week ago and have since done it 3 times. The first time it was exactly what I expected. Repetitive routines with a slightly dance like feel (even the kick boxing inspired section feels dance like) while incorporating weights in a way that is safe for my lower back problems. Some reviews say the steps are too hard for people who don't have a dance background. I do have a little bit of a dance background, so I picked the video up fine the first time. The instructor does a great job talking you through the moves, and she teaches everything by starting a simple move and adding on time and time again. Some people get too frustrated if they can't follow something right away. The important thing is to keep moving the entire time. The choreography will come with time, and as for calorie burning, your body could care less if you get all the steps right... and I'm guessing you are doing this from home, so who cares if you look silly a half a dozen times while you learn it? We all have to start somewhere. Don't let ""tricky"" choreography be one more excuse of why you won't step out of your comfort zone and work your body hard.

As for those who say the DVD is not challenging enough... I hear ya. 6 months ago I would have found this DVD very challenging from both a cardio and a weight training stand point, but I have been working out hard and dropped 60 pounds since then. I take a lot of classes and have seen how instructors who really push me always have a lot of hopping around for the challenge and offer an easier modification for those who need it. Think of this video as a middle ground. It offers an easier modification to the actual routine, but why not try upping the challenge. There are many ways that you can modify the cardio to make it more intense. For moves that have high intensity for only a few reps, try doing the higher intensity version of the move for the whole time. Anywhere you can add a hop, do so. The routine is very repetitive, so you can find a move to substitute for a lower impact move to get more out of the routine. As for the weights with cardio sections. Do the video enough times to figure out when you can use heavier weights. I think they suggest 3-5 pounds, but why not pull out your 8-10 pound weights for all the leg and four limb work? A lot of the video can be done substituting a heavier set of weights to make it more challenging. Don't ever feel like you are stuck doing exactly what they do in the video. Start challenging yourself above an beyond what the video suggests. I love love love this video because of how simple it is to modify. The moves are solid and planned out very well, and they aren't so dancy that they encourage bad form for weight lifting.

I do get slightly bored with the DVD like anything I do because I prefer live classes (I have ADD, so I have trouble paying attention to the TV screen in comparison to an instructor standing in front of me barking out commands), but I combine this one with jiggle free abs and have a little bit over an hour of good cardio with weights. It is great for days I can't get to the gym. The great thing about this DVD is that the cool down is not as much of a stop and stretch deal. Your heart rate is elevated until the end to some extent, so transitioning between this and jiggle free abs works out pretty well. (Jiggle free abs is part of the TRANSFIRMER series, so while it is meant to be done with the transformer steps, you could very well use a chair or something else to modify the routine)

You won't go wrong with this video. I do suggest alternating it with something a little more focused on weigh training once you get to the point you want to tone up, but it is a great place to start with weights if you aren't currently doing anything with them.",1330646400,2,3805,4.245517241379311
2593282,4,B000FZETWK,"I get my heart rate up in the video (445 calories in 45 minutes), but some of it is too slow. It would be more beneficial to me if more of it was upbeat. I LOVE kickboxing, which is why I chose 4 stars, but I would like it to be a bit more challenging...",1327190400,,254,3.6363636363636362
2593283,5,B000FZETWK,"After losing about 70 pounds in high school, I ended up gaining about 40 back throughout my senior year. When I graduated and saw my developed graduation pictures, I nearly cried over how heavy I looked. The next day, I went out and purchased this DVD and started doing it daily, along with a lean diet, and ended up losing 40 pounds over that summer. I looked absolutely wonderful. My arms were toned (because of the weight training) and my legs were lean and muscular from the series of squats done in this workout. Everybody commented on how great I looked! I really enjoy this workout. Not only is it short enough for even the busiest person, but it is extremely effective. I actually just started doing it again a week ago and have already lost 5 pounds in a seven-day period. If you are looking for quick and lasting results, this DVD is for you! Completely recommend.",1318464000,5,874,4.537974683544304

2593287,3,B000FZETWK,"I have been using FIRM workouts since college (over 10 years ago! *gulp*), but these newer ones are disappointing.  I think the saving grace is Kelsie Daniels' kickboxing workout--it is actually a new favorite of mine now.  It finally felt like the old FIRM--lots of four-limb and then some isolated toning exercises interspersed with cardio.  While it was fast-paced and I still haven't mastered all the moves, I know I will eventually get there and I look forward to doing it.

I agree with other reviews that the other cardio workouts on this DVD are too repetitive, dull, and fussy with footwork.  It was difficult to get my heartrate up because I couldn't throw myself into the workout--I was too busy trying not to trip over my own feet!

What I don't get is how the back of the DVD promotes these 25-minute ""express"" workout options, and apparently I just don't get how that's supposed to work.  I don't see an option for it on the menu, nor is one included at the end of any of the workouts....am I missing something?

The sequences are long yet with only about 2-4 reps of each move so you don't get much of a chance to get into a rhythm. And as I said, the transitions are awkward, with arms moving in a different direction that would logically come next. I also find the instructor to be very stale and overly rehearsed. Between the frustration of flailing all around the room, and the robotic tone and smiles of the instructor/models, it's a very unmotivating workout.",1238025600,2,628,4.566371681415929

It gets boring after a while and the moves just get confusing after a while and I lose interest as I'm trying to get a workout.  I just want a good workout...it doesn't have to be this complicated.,1231891200,,410,4.285714285714286
2593300,2,B000FZETWK,"I picked up this DVD looking for something new to add to my weekly workouts.  As soon as I started this workout, I felt like I was always 3 steps behind!  My major complaint is that there is absolutely not enough time to get down the moves.  During the second cardio segment, when she was ""sashay-ing"" around, I must have looked like I was having a seizure trying to keep up with that little blonde. I admit, I gave up about 25 minutes into the video and did another workout. It just seems to me that if you're going to try a workout like this, failure for those who can't pick up the moves right off the bat shouldn't be a consequence.  The weight training segments I did like, but overall this workout is not for those as uncoordinated as myself.  For all of us who like having time to learn the moves before doing them, I would suggest try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-5-Mile-Fat-Burning-Walk/dp/B001F12ISU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk</a>.",1230422400,,1070,5.161849710982659
2593301,5,B000FZETWK,"This is my first voyage back into working out using aerobic exercise, and I really like this video. The instructor is cute, perky, and not annoying, the exercises are totally fat-blasting and do-able, and the music is bearable.

The first time I tried I got frustrated, but who doesn't? When you aren't used to moving around at a fast pace and in coordination, this can seem overwhelming at first. But on my 2nd try, I had absorbed much more than I thought I did.

The mix of stretching, cardio, weights with cardio, dance, and kickboxing are really awesome and she does the reps long enough so that you don't feel all over the place. She has you do several moves in order over and over, so you really have it memorized by the 3rd or 4th time.

I am trying to shed a few pounds and tone my body back up. This is the way to do it. I am working my whole body and building fat while burning muscle, which is something that running on a treadmill and elliptical machines don't do easily.

The Ultimate Fat Burning Workout is a good combination of both cardio and weight workouts.  Although the cardio could have been tougher, this DVD offers a great overall total body workout in a reasonable period of time. (40 min.) Alison is an excellent instructor and very easy to follow.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a comprehensive workout in under one hour.",1223424000,,565,4.854166666666667

It really, really gave me a great workout and I am just drenched after it's over.  Alison does a great job in this video starting out slow with the steps before speeding it up and adding on.  Great cues for the moves.  It is now my favorite video because of the intensity of the workout it give me.",1215043200,,421,4.2784810126582276
2593304,4,B000FZETWK,"I am a regular home exerciser, and am very partial to THE FIRM series.  I have tried many other workouts, but The FIRM is my favorite series.  One thing I have noticed over the years, is that The FIRM series is the ""most professional"".  What I mean by this is that the instuctors commentary strays little from the workout instruction.  I can't stand it when I hear a personal comment in a DVD.  It gets tiring if you do the workout more than a couple of times a month.  Additionally, I like the fact that all the attendees in the class with the instructor, dress similar to the instructor, in non-offensive workout gear.  I have a couple of Crunch series DVD's and some the people in the class are wearing the strangest things.  Pajama like bottoms are hardly inspiring for a workout.

Now, more specifically to this workout with Alison Davis.  I like this one quite a lot, and it's definitely one of the favorites in my collection of 20 or so DVD's.  I like fairly hard core exercise that pushes me, and I really only find that in this DVD and a couple other FIRM workouts.  I especailly like the ones with Aly Del Rio (another good FIRM instructor) and Alison Davis.

I have managed to stay a 2P for 8 months by doing THE FIRM most every day.  I really believe it's one of the toughest workout series out there.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I wish it were just a little bit more challenging than it is.",1212624000,,1431,4.307116104868914
2593305,5,B000FZETWK,"In the morning, when I'm tired and groggy and have forced myself out of bed to workout, I usually stand in front of my DVD player and go through my pile of workout videos deciding what I'm in the mood for that morning.  I choose this video more often than any of the others.  It's only 40 minutes, so that's nice (especially if I've hit the snooze button one too many times.)  Also, it's entertaining to do.  The different segments go quickly, and there aren't many parts of it that I don't actually enjoy doing.  What I get out of it does depend on what I put into though.  Sometimes, if I'm doing the moves somewhat half-heartedly, I'll end up burning at least 150 less calories (according to my handy-dandy heart rate monitor) than if I do it with a lot of intensity and good form.
All in all, one of my favorite ""go-to"" workouts because I actually like doing it...which ultimately makes all the difference in the world.",1212537600,2,923,4.431952662721893

2593307,2,B000FZETWK,"I love the Firm, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other newer Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. The second aerobics sequence in this DVD is a prime example of what feels like a lot of complicated yet boring moving around that feels like less exercise than if I just walked back and forth in front of my TV. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/""put out."" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could. I'm giving this one 2 stars rather than 1 because I do like some of the four-limb segments and because it's the least bad of all the newer (non-fannylifter/non-transfirmer) Firm DVDs I've tried.",1210204800,,1205,4.506849315068493
2593308,4,B000FZETWK,"""The Firm Ultimate Fat Burning Workout"" was one of the first Firm DVDs that I ever purchased.  I presently own about half of The Firm's collection, and I definitely will be buying more!
As in most Firm programs, this workout combines weights and toning moves with cardio to not only slim you down, but shape you up. From warmup to cooldown, it is about 45 minutes long.
The warmup is basically a mini cardio workout that will get your heartrate up pretty quickly.  It is about 8 minutes or so and consists of marching, knee lifts, some front kicks, hamstring curls and some light jumping (though instructor Alison explains that you could substitute any jumping for squats or toe raises if you have knee problems).
The program itself has 2 rotations of a fast-paced scultping section with weights followed by a cardio section.  The weight sections are made up of about 3 repetitions of different squats and lunges combined with simultaneous bicep curls, arm lifts, etc. (If you're not so coordinated, this may be a bit of a challenge for you to keep up.  But eventually you will get it!)
The first cardio section is a combo of marching, side steps and some dance-y moves like mambos and cross-steps.  The second cardio section is kickboxing.  (One thing about the cardio sections are that they are designed in a very repetitive add-on style.  The plus side is that you will learn the steps quickly.  The drawback is that you will probably get bored quickly!)
The cooldown, like most of The Firm's workouts, is active, with core waist work such as twisting, side-to-side lunges and push-ups.  (However, there is no REAL ab work, so you will have to find a seperate workout for that.)
""UFBW"" is pretty much a low impact (not a lot of hard jumping) but challenging workout that definitely will shape your legs, buns, back, arms, and waist, and you WILL sweat.  (If you want to try something a little harder though, I recommend The Firm's ""Bootcamp: Maximum Calorie Burn.""  Though I personally feel that ""UFBW"" is more fun, ""Bootcamp"" is just that: a very intense, high-impact program designed to achieve maximum results FAST.)
The instructor, Alison Davis, is encouraging in a calm and quiet way.  (She has a southern twang, so if you're not from the South, hopefully that won't bother you!)
Overall, a great workout that will whip you into bikini shape quickly!

2593309,3,B000FZETWK,"Good workout but...Like any excercise DVD with dance type moves/excercises, it can be tough to get all the moves down as fast as needed. The leader moves from one step to the other pretty quickly.",1208131200,,196,4.628571428571429
2593310,5,B000FZETWK,This was the first of the new firms that I have tried. I love it. It is fun and full of cardio with light weight training. I especially loved the kickboxing segment and the music. I have now tried several of the new firms and this still holds at the top as one of my favorites. I like Allison as an instructor and think she does an excellent job in this workout. I am a Firmie and have the other step systems and while I think those are probably a little better of a workout due to the step; it is a nice change in my routine to not use the steps everyday. I hope you all like this workout as much as I do!,1207008000,2,606,3.856

There are a few what I consider 'tricky' steps in the salsa dancing that I had to do a few times first before doing the workout.  The kickboxing is awesome, great cuing and variety of moves.

It was a little boring, especially the warm up, which was the usual Firm fare. She seems nervous and disconnected from what's going on as she gives instructions and cues. She really doesn't have a engaging personality. So if that is a big deciding factor then this video may not be for you. Also,her kickboxing form is not correct, and she gives no safety cues.

The first couple of times I had a really hard time following and once you are lost catching up is tough. I am not a workout addict and this dvd is perfect for people that just want a quick at home workout. It's not complicated either, the moves are not hard but the workout itself is tough.

2593320,3,B000FZETWK,"This seems to be a good workout, but they should have a disclaimer that you need to have advanced aerobic and/or dance skills.....fancy footwork for a beginner.",1201478400,,160,4.962962962962963
2593321,4,B000FZETWK,"This workout is challenging because it is fast-paced and if you slow down a bit, you will miss the cues. However, it is also a very enjoyable workout for those experienced with aerobics choreography and weights. I find the mix of dance moves, weight-lifting moves and kick-boxing to be lots of fun.

As a dancer, I have always found static weight lifting extremely boring. I only buy DVD's that combine weights with aerobics or pilates moves. This video does a great job of blending aerobics and weight-lifting. I am not bored for even a moment, and I like the cardio breaks in between lifting because they give my muscles a rest.

Due to the fast pacing, however, I would not recommend this video for those new to weights, nor would I recommend doing it when you are tired, low on energy or not feeling well.  It is too easy to injure yourself under those circumstances, because the transitions are very quick and it is challenging trying to maintain good form. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

In some spots, the combination of a weight lifting move in one plane of motion with a vigorous aerobic movement in another plane, can be a bit risky.  I strained a muscle one night (when I was tired and should have skipped the workout)while doing the french presses that are combined with the forward kicks. Now, I just skip the french presses in that section as a precaution.

I was delighted to find that Allison doesn't stick with standard lifting moves, such as basic bicep curls/ tricep presses. Instead, most of the moves are complex ones that involve twisting and/or movement of multiple joints--much closer to what we do in real life every day. Not only does this make the workout more challenging and more interesting; it also means that you are working muscles in ways that you wouldn't with a standard weights workout.

I have been recovering from injuries to my back and rotator cuff muscles (a slow process), and this workout is perfect for the final stages of my recovery. It is helping me to rebuild strength in my chest, upper back, shoulders and triceps. Needless to say, I'm thrilled that the workout also happens to be a lot of fun.",1197763200,,2159,4.606770833333333

2593326,4,B000FZETWK,"This is a low impact cardio workout approximately 40 minutes in length and uses only light (3-5 pound) weights.  The warm-up is simple and steps are added on and then repeated.  While others have found this repetitious and boring, I enjoyed the initial simplicity.  I will admit I'm not a quick take on footwork, so I had to concentrate to nail the steps on the dance-step sequence.  I found the steps enjoyable to do, especially when I got the hang of it and the time flew by.  The shuffle, chasse, samba pattern reminded me of one of the routines in Denise Austin's Personal Trainer Workout DVD.

The kickboxing segment and some of the combinations reminded me of Tae Bo and my only real issue is that they don't give you better pointers on form for the punches.  There is one section where you hold one light weight out in front of you and twist to the side that I find potentially prone to injuring my back and I'll probably opt out of that exercise when I do the workout in the future.

The instructor, Alison Davis, was energetic, upbeat and gave excellent cues - I'm hoping to see her leading on some of the future Firm workouts.

I'm an intermediate exerciser and worked up a great sweat, but never felt breathless - just worked out without being wiped out.  I loved the 40 minute length and having another enjoyable cardio workout for my rotation, as I get bored faster with cardio workouts than I do weight or aerobic weight training workouts.",1190160000,,1453,4.532567049808429

The kickboxing segment will bore advanced martial artists, but a martial artist shouldn't need an aerobic DVD! I think it's tons of fun and feel like I'm getting good workouts. Just be ready to hit the shower after you push through this one.",1187136000,5,499,4.4945054945054945

I did think it would be a bit more of a workout, but I still work up a sweat. That may be relative though, depending on your level of fitness.

Her cueing is OK, and she layers it nicely. Like most of the videos sometimes the camera work could be better, it's pretty but when you are transitioning from one move to another & trying to learn the move, it is not the time for the camera to move or pan anywhere.

The editor clearly wasn't paying any attention to the audio when he/she edited this dvd. There are many times when the instructor mentions an option that she is demonstrating and they choose to cut to a person in the back, so in some instances, you never see the alternative she is showing.

I'm glad they're branching out and providing more videos to do in between classic Firm videos.

By the end, I was sweating pretty hard.  I don't think I'll be sore tomorrow or anything (I guess I'll see) but then again, this is a cardio workout so the objective is to work up a good sweat. Unlike some reviewers, I liked the amount of repetition in the movements.  It seems to help me get in a good rhythm.  Perhaps that will eventually get boring but I think the workout was rather fun.

I liked the twisting abs moves as I think that's something that will make a big difference over time but beginners should be careful not to twist too much as you could injure yourself.

I will add this one to my regular rotation- esp. on days I don't feel like doing leg presses or getting out a lot of equipment.  Not the hardest Firm DVD but still enough to get a good cardio workout.",1175126400,,950,4.181318681318682

No equipment required except for a pair of handweights, which are optional.  The workout alternates moderate cardio segments (i.e. kickboxing, aerobic dance, etc.) and toning segmeents (i.e. various combinations of lunges/squats coupled with a bicep curl/lateral raise, etc.).  You can make the toning segments more intense by using heavier weights.  The workout ends with some ab work and about 16 or so straight-legged push-ups (sorry, I don't remember exactly how many, but I could do them all military style, so that tells me it could NOT have been more than 24 since that is my limit!).

2593350,5,B000FZETWK,"This was the very first FIRM workout I tried and it's GREAT. I was really searching for a kickboxing type of video but ""settled"" with this one as Fat Burn was what I was looking for; and also because I thought the girl on the cover (Alison Davis) had a nice and fit body. I wasn't looking to look like a body-builder! I tried it out and I LOVED it. The next day I felt like every single muscle in my body was sore- I knew I was getting a total body workout AND I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did include a kickboxing segment. I have since purchased a number of other FIRM workouts (the TRANSFIRMER series, the jiggle-free series, and Beginners YOGA) but this one continues to be my favorite. I've been doing it routinely for the last 5 months and it continues to be challenging. I have NEVER been one to workout and now I'm hooked! I used to practically drag myself to the treadmill but now that I workout with this and other FIRM DVDs, I feel motivated and even look forward to my workouts; and I really get a much more intense and total workout in a shorter amount of time than on my treadmill. I also love Alison- she is my favorite FIRM instructor. Her cueing is great and she doesn't switch quickly from one move to the next as some of the other FIRM instructors; this way you can focus on form instead of constant move/step changes. I ordered her new Bootcamp DVD which will hopefully arrive any day- I'm sure it will be great as well.

The cuing is excellent and there's a good variety of moves that keeps me interested throughout the whole thing (and on multiple repetitions).

2593357,4,B000FZETWK,"OK so I wasn't much of a fan of this workout initially since it seemed to move too fast and had too many complicated moves which made it tough to keep up. The level of the exercises wasn't the problem it was the intricacies of all the moves which kept changing and made me feel like I had two left feet half the time. I still am not a fan of the step-step-pivot portion which makes me feel dizzy the first few times, but this DVD has grown on me as I've learned to anticipate the moves. The music is good and the instructor is very clear with all her cues. So once you get the hang of it and move on to heavier hand weights for the sculpting portion this turns out to be a pretty good 40 minute low impact workout.

I continue to like this workout even more. Some complain about the repetitiveness but I see the add-on method as a great way the instructor gets me to do some really effective exercises many more times than I'd want to do them in one go.  The kickboxing portion is especially good. I find myself reaching for this DVD whenever I don't have much time but still want a great workout.

2593369,3,B000FZETWK,"I love the traditional Firm videos- like Standing Legs, the original series with Janet Jones et al, and the most recent batch of Transfirmers.  Since I am trying to burn some pure baby weight- all fat- i bought a few of the cardio fat burning focus videos- like this one and Ultimate Carolie Blaster.  I was also looking for one that didn't need a step or heavy weights so that I could take it on trips and do it in my hotel room on my laptop.

This video does fit the bill perfectly, except...

I can't dance.  I have no coordination.  Instead of doing- one low jack- one samba step- one heel pump- why can't they do 20 low jacks, 20 sambas, 20 heel pumps?  I know the more coordinated folks might find that boring, but I spend most of my time marching in place and trying to learn the steps- even after doing it about 5 times.

I know I will eventually learn the routines and it will get easier, but I just wish I could find one that allowed me just to get my heart rate up, provide me with some variety and didn't require a a big space for back and forth grapevines, etc.",1167264000,3,1074,4.154589371980676
2593370,3,B000FZETWK,"I owned the old VHS Firm Basics: Fat Burning Workout with the purple cover, and I absolutely loved it!  In that video, the cardio was broken up into sections and alternated with dips and lunges and other isolation-type movements.  The format was great because when I felt like I was too tired (or bored) to do anymore cardio, the entire pace (including instructors) would change.  It kept me motivated.  Anyway, I had hoped this new DVD would be a similar version of that program, and really it wasn't.

In this DVD, I felt like the cardio would never end.  Don't get me wrong; I know this is supposed to be a workout.  For me, however, the format made the workout feel longer.  The footwork got a little fussy for me, and between the moves that suggested hopping and the kickboxing portion, I feel the back cover's claim, ""All of the exercises are low-impact and easy to follow,"" is misleading.

Will you get a workout?  Sure.  Is it what I expected?  Not really.  Based on that, I give it a lukewarm recommendation.

2593374,3,B000FZETWK,"I know that there are a lot of long-term, die-hard Firm fans out there, but I'm not one of them.  However, through trial and error, I have acquired a few Firm workouts that I like and use regularly. I had high hopes for this particular workout, as it seemed to combine many things that I enjoy, including moderate-length cardio, 4-limb work, kickboxing, and some functional fitness moves as well.  I do feel that this DVD provides a solid overall workout, but some aspects left me feeling a bit disappointed.  The workout includes an 8-minute warm-up, 23 minutes of cardio, and an 9-minute cool-down/abs segment, coming in at just over 40 minutes total.

Instructor Allison Davis begins starts off with the warm-up, which felt overly long and boring to me.  Admittedly, the moves were pretty typical Firm offerings--eg, march, in-out march, step-touch, back cross, hamstring curl, step squat, knees up, kick front--but it would be nice if the Firm did something different for a change.  About 3 minutes into the warm-up, you perform a very brief series of moving stretches.  After this, I was thinking that the warm-up was over, but instead, Alison introduces some new cardio moves (v-steps, calf pumps, low jacks, and hops), and THEN, she actually goes back and repeats all of the original warm-up moves!  The way this opening sequence was structured just seemed to make the warm-up drag on and on.

Luckily, I enjoyed the workout itself significantly more than the warm-up portion.  Alison moves into the first segment of 4-limbed cardio, which lasts about 5 minutes.  She suggests 3- or 5-lb. dumbbells; I used the latter but found that they were a bit heavy for some of the upper body moves.  She introduces a sequence which is repeated 3 times total, going slightly faster each time:  squat with overhead twist press, knees with french press, forward lunge with lat rows, front kicks with forward press, side lunge with upright row, side taps with biceps/triceps press, and finally, rear dip with biceps curl (staying on the same leg each time through).  During this segment, my heart rate stayed up, and I enjoyed the functional nature of many of the moves (ie, twisting and bending, similar to what you might see in one of Tracie Long's videos).  Next comes a floor cardio segment.  This section was okay, but again, it felt rather repetitive, especially because Alison teaches in an add-on ""take it from the top"" style.  She begins with a chasse and samba, gradually adding in a cross step, press foot, pivot, and v-step.  Given that this section is 6 minutes long, the simple above sequence is repeated MANY times.

Another 4-limb section follows using the same format as the first 4-limb segment.  Exercises here included travel squat with alternate upright row (which felt awkward), front lunge with delt flye, side leg raise with punch, side lunge with lat row, front-side-front step with medial delt raise, and then finally, a rear dip/biceps combo working the other leg.  As with the first section, this sequence is performed 3 times total (approximately 4 minutes).  The final segment (and the longest at 8 minutes) is cardio kickboxing.  I love kickboxing and did enjoy the punching and kicking included here, but I would've preferred more variety and interest in the choreography.  The moves included a shuffle with an inner side kick, knee-kick, alternating knees, jabs/uppercuts, jab-cross-knee, and a front kick/punch.  It would've have been great if this segment had included some rear/roundhouse kicks, more punches, a few additional combos, and a few additional combinations.

I found the final cool-down to be rather odd.  It starts with about 2 minutes of aerobic cool-down work which includes samba with a heel lift, side leg extension with a body wave, squat/round back, and side touch with pull down (as I did throughout the entire workout, I found that the arm movements felt a bit ""fussy"" here).  Then you pick up one of your dumbbells for about 3 minutes of standing abs work.  I usually really enjoy working the abs this way, but I found the moves here (twist with knee lift, plie with 1-hand overhead press, plie with twist) to be a bit awkward.  The sequence is repeated once on each side.  Next comes a 2-minute final stretch; this actually has some nice lunge work, including a side reach and twist.  But then inexplicably, the workout ends with 2-minutes of push-ups/plank work--why not put this before the final stretches?  I definitely didn't like having to do additional strength work after I had already warmed down (there is only a quick down dog and deep breaths to finish).

The best thing about this workout was that I was in my target heart rate zone for a very good portion, close to 35 minutes.  For virtually this reason alone--and also because SOME of the moves were actually fun (just too repetitive)--I will keep this DVD, at least for now.  I would recommend this workout to someone who doesn't mind a lot of repetition and who is looking for a basic but fairly intense floor cardio workout.

UPDATE 4/26/07:  This workout has grown on me over time.  I've found that if I skip the warm-up, the remaining routine feels much less repetitive, and I get a strong cardio workout in under 30 minutes.  If I could change my rating, I would upgrade to 4 stars.",1163635200,99,5305,4.864142538975501

2593377,4,B000FZETWK,"Pluses about the above workout:

The above DVD is a fast paced, dance based workout that has a few weight segments in it. It is quick if you are pressed for time Allison Davis is an inspired aerobic instructor that is easy to follow.  Despite only needing 3 to 5 pound weights for the workout, it was suprisingly tough on my arms. It also has a tough abs section.  I was surpised that I hurt the day after I did this workout.

Drawbacks:

  There is very little leg work in this DVD. You will do squats and front lunges but nothing else.  The dance steps are involved, and might scare away someone who is dance challenged (like my husband, who normally does FIRM workouts with me but will not go near this one).  Also, the music sounded familiar.  When I checked my vast collection of excersize tapes/DVDs, the music came from Cathe Friedrich's CTX series.

This is still a decent workout, just not a classic Firm one.  I would buy it again.  I do this workout on my light days when I do not feel like excersizing.",1162771200,28,1014,4.358288770053476

Best of all,  Ultimate Fat Burning doesn't require the  laundry list of equipment the Classics are (in)famous for.  It's more cardio than sculpting (and all standing) so the single pair of dumbbells should be ones which can be used throughout - including for shoulder and delt work - without pausing to swap.  There are no low-impact modifications suggested and all are doing the same exercises but you can surely figure out some fall-back move  to catch your breath until you can join back in if necessary. The music is good  and the cool down portion includes some cool dynamic stretches that use a single dumbbell.  Really smart and enjoyable workout.",1522368000,,726,4.714285714285714
8127758,2,B000FZETWK,"Clearly all you've got to do is look at this lady and the those behind her - especially the one at the far left on screen - to see that WHATEVER they do to stay fit - IT WORKS perfectly. They have extraordinary healthy and attractive bodies and clearly their fitness programs are effective. I don't see  an ounce of non-toned body in either case.

HOWEVER, I absolutely can not follow the machine gun of constant changes (add ons) they make throughout the routine. Now, I'm not a complete fitness dummy. I did P90x for years and some Jillian Michaels workouts too, so I understand how they set you up to start something, then add on to get multiple moves and muscle groups worked in the same exercise. But Alison is having to talk *constantly* - with every move - because it seems like they 'add on' every 2 reps.

If that's the case, start out with a couple of the moves in place already instead of having to switch switch switch from the start.  By the time I catch on to the updated move, they've added another... and another ... and I'm done.  Plus the ongoing talking takes away from the focus after a while.  Early in every move? I get it, set up the move for me, talk me through it.  But it's 2 reps, then add this, 2 reps, now do this, 2 reps, move this way now, and kick... There's no rhythm to it.  With Jillian Michaels and Tony Horton, the whole move is laid out at the start even if it's more than one action, then any add ons are minimal and easier to make once you've got the primary moves down.

I LOVE her enthusiasm, and as I clearly stated, she and her crew pass the eye test as to 'does this work?' She's lean and healthy and sexy and could bury me on any fitness test. But after about 20 seconds, I don't want to even try to keep up because I know there's several more changes coming and I haven't gotten the 1st ones in place yet.  Frustrating because one look says the results would be great.

This is the 2nd DVD of the series that I've gotten and both of them have this issue.  KEEP IT SIMPLE, add on a little bit - or break them up into separate sets of moves.",1518307200,,2086,4.1745635910224435
