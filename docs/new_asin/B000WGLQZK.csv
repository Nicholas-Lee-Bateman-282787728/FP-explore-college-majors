8223259,5,B000WGLQZK,I showed this to my class of first graders and they loved it. I wish it was on DVD.,1404691200,,83,3.4210526315789473
8223260,5,B000WGLQZK,"This is a fabulous children's video.  It has 3 stories in a half an hour:  A boy, a dog, and a frog; frog goes to dinner, and frog on his own.  There are few words spoken, none by major characters; but the story tells itself -- and it is absolutely delightful.  I watched this with my 4 year old son, and his grandparents and we all loved it.  I'm astounded this doesn't show on more top 10 lists.",1189555200,,397,4.038461538461538
