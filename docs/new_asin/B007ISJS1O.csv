5089576,5,B007ISJS1O,"In the winter of 1982 I was spellbound by the 8 part mini-series Love in a Cold Climate shown on Masterpiece Theater.  I looked forward to seeing it again, but to my dismay it was never repeated and I had to rely only on my memories except for short clips on Youtube. Now at last it's born again as a DVD set, and I can barely wait to once again feast my eyes on it.

The mini-series combines Nancy Mitford's two companion novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, both of which were published in the late 1940s and are the most autobiographical of all of her novels.  The main and most compelling portions deal with the romantic vissisitudes of young Linda Radlett, daughter of the eccentric Lord Alconleigh and his vague but loving wife (ably played by Judi Dench).  Linda longs for love, finding it first in a young but extremely dull banker, next in a dedicated Communist, and finally in an aristocratic French duke.  Her cousin and best friend Fanny, the narrator of the series and of the two books from which it is drawn, leads a much quieter life, falling in love with an eminently suitable young Oxford don and never falling out of it again.  Linda and Fanny's friend Polly Hampton, the daughter of a courtly old Earl and his dragonlady wife, has her own romantic troubles that lead her into turmoil as well.

That's the barebones plot outline of the main story, but there is much more to love in this mini-series.  All of the characters are loveable and delightfully eccentric, from Linda and Fanny's hypochondriacal Uncle Davey to their highly artistic neighbor Lord Merlin. Besides Judi Dench, there are a host of excellent actors and actresses, including Michael Aldridge and most enjoyably Vivian Pickles as Polly's mother Lady Montdore. The story bounces from English country houses to refugee camps in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War to elegant Parisian apartments and London mansions.

In the early 2000s a much shorter version of Love in a Cold Climate was filmed and is also available on DVD.  Of necessity it left out many of the characters and abridged the main story line quite a bit.  While the newer version has charms of its own, it cannot compare to this wonderful production which is now, once again, ours to own and love forever.",1340323200,94,2276,4.650872817955112
5089577,5,B007ISJS1O,"Compare 2 adaptations of Love in a Cold Climate? Both excellent, both should be viewed. Each combines the same two Nancy Mitford novels. Equally stellar casts. Both mime the novels: accurate in period detail, well written, provide popping emotion from humor to tragic, even using some book dialogue. Why opt for this new release? MORE! 255 minutes longer of delightful drama and interaction of 1930 romances.

Fanny is the key character telling the story. With a more common face, Isabelle Amyes is great in this long series, but I also love Rosamund Pike's arresting smile (short version.) Both are great stars doing a fantastic Fanny. In this l-o-n-g series Judi Dench (as Aunt Sadie) fans will swear by her perfection, rightly so.  Keeping up with the Dench excellence is Davey Warbeck (by Michael Williams), and Uncle Matt (by Michael Aldridge). Cast comparisons could take forever.

Even with over 400 minutes, the story of 2 Mitford novels can't be complete, but this set is delightfully closer than the short 2 episode 2001 remake. I'll watch this set again.",1336348800,46,2151,5.084985835694051

5089589,5,B007ISJS1O,"It is difficult to express how much I enjoyed this series. I'm not an expert, so I can't speak to things like production values, but I truly enjoyed everything about ""Love in a Cold Climate."" It is subtle, which I find refreshing in these times of brash, over-the-top productions. It creates it's own aesthetic with the pacing, dialogue, costumes and setting, and I really felt that I was living day-in and day-out with the characters in that cold, forbidding climate.  It doesn't grab you all at once, but it stays with you and won't let go. Even now, having watched it several months ago, images of scenes or snippets of dialog will pop into my head from time to time when I am working or doing something completely unrelated.  It is a treasure I will keep with me always.  It may not appeal to some modern, American viewers, but it is a must for all Anglophiles and Judi Dench fans.",1423267200,6,885,4.51875
5089590,4,B007ISJS1O,"I love the two books , Love in a Cold Climate and the Pursuit of Love that I read them every year . I disagree with the first two reviewers and thought this mini series was not quite good enough but it so difficult to recreate the accents of the upper class before the second world war and certainly Judy Dench does not do this though in the books the character of Sadie is not a strong one ..not like her husbands or that of the three Montdores ..and if any one buys this DVD to hear Judy Dench play the part of a landed gentry titled lady in the 1940s , they will be disppointed . The main character is Linda and the main theme is the agony of her loves .. The second theme is Cedric and his camp mischief and almost as a distraction there are numerous people in the stories that each have their own character . But dominating is the theme of love and with Linda her sad experiences and I thought this mini series wandered around rather than concentrate on the main theme .Am I right in saying there was a change in directors after the first part ?? . This is not the first mid war  classic that has not quite made it .Cold Comfort Farm falls into the same slot",1421798400,2,1163,4.100877192982456

5089601,5,B007ISJS1O,"This dramatization of Nancy Mitford's marvelous, bittersweet, satiric novels, Love In a Cold Climate and the Pursuit of Love, is a somewhat ironic and mocking valentine to a vanished era, even as it was in the process of irreversible change, as well to a former self of the author, who obviously remembers the girl and naive young woman she once had been with affection and some pain.  This series is quite true to the novels, especially their gently mocking, satiric tone, doubtless due to the much greater amount of time which could be devoted to portraying them.

What may not be generally appreciated by American audiences is that the characters populating the novels are but thinly veiled sketches of Nancy Mitford's highly eccentric family, relations and friends and of types then current in the English peerage and gentry.  Lord Merlin, for instance, is the composer and eccentric, Lord Berners whose home was really as exotic as it is portrayed in the books and in the series.  The womanizer, Fabrice de Sauveterre is essentially a portrait of Nancy's own love interest, the Frenchman, Gaston Palewski.  Lady Montdore, on the other hand, played with great verve and wit by the inimitable Vivian Pickles in this series, is no specific person, but a type of the insular, wealthy and self-regarding aristocrat who is so wrapped up in herself and her set that upon her return from India, her husband having served as Viceroy, she declares her time there quite the social triumph, so much so that she rather thinks that they've put India on the map.

The first episode of the series is difficult to get into - it is a view of Nancy and her siblings as youngsters and their rather lunatic household - unless you've read the novels or are familiar with the goings-on, everything feels a bit as though it is in code.  Once in stride, however, if you give the series a chance, you're liable to find yourself as enchanted as I was years ago when it first debuted on PBS.",1393891200,4,1968,4.7368421052631575
5089602,1,B007ISJS1O,This is supposed to be a Blu-ray? The image and the audio are closer to a bad VHS. I'm not joking it's really unwatchable.

5089604,5,B007ISJS1O,"Love Judi Dench.  This is a great show about several families before and during WWII.  In the first show, it was a little hard to understand the younger girls when they talked - partly because of the accent and because they talked fast.  I could get the story though by watching what they were doing.  Sad ending but a really great story.  I like that this is in a series where I don't have to sit down and watch the whole show.

Nancy Mitford's stories are a funny, poignant and heart wrenching fictional look at her family and the people in the British aristocracy with whom she grew up.
For historical information on the real people behind these stories, google ""The Mitford Sisters"" and ""Vita Sackaville-West"".

5089629,4,B007ISJS1O,"""Love in a Cold Climate,"" is a 1980 British television miniseries that was adapted from popular British author Nancy Mitford's comic novels, THE PURSUIT OF LOVE and LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE.  This period romantic drama/comedy was made by Thames television, which really knew how to make costume dramas, and really threw money at the screen, in ball room scenes, cars, clothes, and interiors.  It is in full color and consists of three disks, eight episodes in all, 420 minutes of running time.  Talented, well-known screenwriter Simon Raven adapted the novels for TV; Donald MacWhinney directed.  Praises be, for this series in which no well-bred British person speaks above a whisper, it has subtitles, for which thanks are due to Acorn.  Thanks are also due to Acorn for finally releasing this series on DVD; its lovers -- including me-- have been waiting a long, long time for this release.

Disk one includes episodes ""Child Hunt,"" ""Coming Out,"" and ""Rings and Things; disk two, ""The Merry Widower, ""Heir Apparent,"" and ""Foreigners are Fiends.""  Disk three gives us ""Monsieur Le Duc,"" and ""In Love and War."" The series follows the eccentric, aristocratic Radlett family from the 1920s through World War II; knowledgeable sources state that it is fact, about the author's eccentric, literary family of beauties,the Mitfords, lightly disguised as fiction.  It centers on three young related women as they search for love: wealthy young beauties Polly Montdore and Linda Radlett, and their poorer, plainer cousin Fanny, who narrates, while just trying not to behave like her mother, who has earned the nickname of The Bolter, as she flits from man to man.  The entertainment boasts quite a few stars, and important supporting players.

Polly is played by Rosalyn Landor, Linda, by Lucy Gutteridge; the careers of both these young actresses rather stuttered out, leading me to believe they were best at playing young beauties.  Isabelle Amyes, who played Fanny, has had somewhat more of a career.

This production manages the unusual trick of being funny and moving, attributable, I expect, to the original material, and the talent before and behind the camera.  It gives us one of Linda's most famous bits of business, in which, when asked to assign refugees from the Spanish civil war to a boat that will carry them to South America, she succeeds admirably, against expectations.  When asked how she did it, she says that she assigned the best cabins to the refugees with ""Labrador"" against their names.  The animal-loving young aristo, unaware that the term means laborer in Spanish, had decided they had Labradors - dogs, and therefore favored them. The twentieth century ""Mitford sisters"" -- six daughters of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale and Sydney Bowles -- became famous for their many love affairs and marriages, were celebrated, and at times scandalous, figures caricatured, according to The Times of London journalist Ben Macintyre, as ""Diana the Fascist, Jessica the Communist, Unity the Hitler-lover; Nancy the Novelist; Deborah the Duchess and Pamela the unobtrusive poultry connoisseur"".

Where the more recent version crams everything into two and a half hours, this earlier series (nearly seven hours) allows much more development of the characters, including secondary and tertiary characters who were scanted or even eliminated in the shorter version. And of course this version has Judi Dench in it (though I would have loved to see Dench as the forceful Lady Montdore, she's  excellent in the more subdued role of Sadie Radlett).  Anyone who's a fan of the Mitford books should really own both versions of the dvds.

You must pay attention to the very first part of it to make sure you realize who all those children are and how they are related, because you watch them grow to adulthood.  I have a hard time with British humor.  I thought the father, Judy Dench's husband, was an absurd character.  Not laughable or funny, just absurd.  I believe he overplayed his character and his booming voice irritated me. Just my opinion.  Would I buy this again? Yes.  I adore Judy Dench.",1349308800,5,638,4.592920353982301
5089637,5,B007ISJS1O,"I know a series is good when all of a sudden the credits start rolling and I realize that I have been totally absorbed in my viewing. Such an experience awaited me when I sat down to watch this 8 part series.  The acting was terrific and the plot engaging but the eccentric characters really tickled me. Judi Dench was as always a delight to watch but it was her late husband, Michael Williams, as Uncle Davey, that really captured my interest.  Vivian Pickles  as Lady Montdore could give Maggie Smith's wonderfully portrayed character, Lady Violet of Downton Abbey, a run for her money.  The writing was witty and don't be surprised if you find yourself letting loose with a much louder laugh than you usually reserve for watching television.  I found this series to be much better than I expected and I recommend it to those who love British manor house dramas.",1347148800,19,864,4.620915032679738

An unusual 'almost biography' from one those infamous Mitford sisters. The early part with the girls as children is a little wooden but when they grow up the story really takes off so stick with it.
It's a rather campy tale of the lives of the wealthy and titled in 1920's-30's England with Judy Dench as mum.",1344816000,28,407,4.513513513513513
