Operation Sussex is such an interesting part of a massively important event of history, and the fact that it's being presented to the public for the first time makes it immensely more intriguing. The film consists mostly of interviews with former members of a top-secret spy mission during WWII, in which they tell their stories of the Resistance, training, and the dangerous tasks they were given in order to obtain delicate information on the Germans. Unlike most documentaries, you aren't just being spoonfed facts by historians- you are getting the first-hand stories of the brave men (and woman) that lived to tell their tales of danger, drama, love, and tragedy. This movie has a little something for anyone!",1441670400,,813,4.9416058394160585
8727120,5,B013BB3SNU,I have had the wonderful opportunity to view this film many times. For World War II history enthusiasists it is a clear winner. I found the actual 1940s news reel footage brilliantly integrated well with the interviews of the survivors of the secret spy mission. Ms Friedman's takes the viewer on a rollcoaster journey from laughter to poignant moments of tears. This documentary is great resource for teaching World War II history.,1440979200,,432,5.013888888888889

1944: At a time when nations worked together, three united in a top secret mission. D-Day was imminent!

Operation Sussex is a documentary film which tells the story of a tripartite intelligence operation involving the Americans, the British and 120 young members of the French Resistance. Leading up to and following D-Day,  the riveting story is told in first person narrative by survivors of the mission. Hear how and why each volunteered for the secret three nation mission Operation: Sussex.

Some press I found:

Operation Sussex is an important film about a little known WWII, top secret, underground network of spies and resistance fighters that [Director] Bonnie Friedman brings to life with stunning clarity and emotion.  Pat Mire, award winning documentary and feature filmmaker, founder and artistic director of Cinema on the Bayou Film Festival

[Operation Sussex] captures a difficult time in WWII for France It is nice to see some history that focuses on the righteous and patriotic Frenchman.  Tom Rolf, Academy Award Winning Editor

WWII documentaries provide insight into a time when the world was really different. Most in my opinion address similar matters. This film addresses something very different and could easily be turned into a major motion picture.",1439251200,,1587,5.350806451612903
