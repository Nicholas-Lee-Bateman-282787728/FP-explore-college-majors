6338241,5,B00J81M1DQ,Understanding the History of Alexander The Great by going on this Journey with David Adams came as an exciting and often times intense viewing experience and historical education. I had no idea of the enormity of Alexanders journey and the places he explored. David has captured this journey with wonderful images together with well researched Narrative that reveals a compelling story in some of the planets most unfriendly and harsh lands.,1401580800,,441,5.225352112676056
6338242,5,B00J81M1DQ,"A visual journey of 6 months, from Greece through Afghanistan, a country seldom seen except in news war clips. This is a unique series following the footsteps of Alexander the Great. You see inside war territory but from historical and archival perspectives, not political. There is much speculative computer generated graphics depicting structures now seen only as photographed ruins. Aussie David Adams uses archeology discoveries supplied by a team of researchers. The Oxus River course changes cause a near impossible quest for historic answers. Post Ice Age climate changes provide clues.
Truly an eye-opening picture of common life in Afghanistan.
For viewers age 9 and up.

SDH SUBTITLES available for this 2012 6-part filming expedition.
Bonus footage as long as an episode, just fragmented in content.
1 EXPLORATION ON AN ANCIENT SEA
Narrator/presenter/photojournalist Adams follows routes of long-past searchers of a lost waterway. Did he find, does he walk in the footsteps of Alexander steps of 2300 years ago? Adams begins in Greece. Is the Argonaut myth actually truth? This is a search into an ancient past over water no longer found, as old as 8000 years. Looking for seas in sand.

2 MOTHER OF ALL CITIES
Capital of Bactria -a city of distinction in the historical trek and quest into the Afghan wild country. It was also a Greek destination. Afghanistan has traces of culture astonishingly preserved in fragments inside a war torn country. Adams dares to search in known Taliban territory.

3 ALEXANDRIA ON THE OXUS
Alexandria's own city, it is claimed, but can it be true? The quest continues in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Was Alexander's army one of fighters or carpenters? Will Alexander's Lost City finally be found?

4 CITY OF THE LADY MOON
A true Greek city ruins in Afghanistan may provide answers to the belief that Alexander built structure as well as conquered lands. See a Greek amphitheater 1000s of miles from Greece.

5 LAND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE
Plunder, booty, & gold was coveted and gathered by Alexander like a pirate captain. He's compared to Jason of the Argonauts. Eastern resources acquired and shipped worldwide is an adventure as old as seagoing vessels. Jason did not have Adams' GPS. Was Alexander lost; or was his history lost?

6 THE SOURCE OF CIVILIZATION
The Roof of the World"" is near the climax of Adams quest exploration. A local tribe claims to be Alexander highland descendants (Wakhi); and at the least, the segment is interesting Afghan tribes seldom visited.

Truly worthy for any educational library,
or for the intellectual explorer minded viewers who prefer to travel to difficult to reach places via film.",1400198400,12,2664,5.082379862700229
6338243,5,B00J81M1DQ,"We loved this series, Our 15yo boy enjoyed it just as much as we did. Now that the dvd box is back in the cupboard, I know we will pull it out year after year to watch. The theories are so original in nature, we couldn't possibly absorb it all in one or even two viewings. Our son related to the historical heros of the story as did we, the 3D overlays bought ancient cities to life. I highly recommend this for any family looking for a sunday afternoon family series that will insight further discussion. Note; it's not for the younger children in the family as the concepts and theories are deep and require a secondary school education. Highly recommended.",1400025600,2,659,4.454545454545454
8648672,4,B00J81M1DQ,"Suggests a major change to what I saw when I was in grad school, but would suggest a reason for some of the Greek colonies in the Crimea.  He says that in the first millenium BC and earlier, the Oxus flowed all the way through the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea to join the Volga a few hundred miles north of where it empties into the Black Sea.  Thus Alexander marching into Afghanistan was doing it the hard way.  It would have been easier to sail on a trade route to Afghanistan.  Most of this is about sites which have not been excavated in what is now desert.  The sites are very large, so it is possible that he is right, that Central Asia in that period was much different, well watered, than it is today.
Not much about Alexander himself.",1513641600,,744,4.211267605633803

8648677,5,B00J81M1DQ,"I've read I don't know how many books on Alexander and the Hellenistic world his campaign influenced including recent works made possible since 2004 in Afghanistan (Bactria).  This program provides a potential explanation that reconciles many things that are hard to visualize on a current world map.  The film is part travel program, exploration and archaeology tracing the world around the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Sea of Azov and Oxus River.  Scholarship is hard pressed to explain why Alexander led his army into modern-day Afghanistan and for such a lengthy part of his overall campaign, nevertheless a major part of his resources were committed in that region.  This 6-hour program is captivating, true adventure, well researched and expertly presented.  It's the logical DVD companion to Michael Wood's Footstep of Alexander.",1455062400,,831,5.361538461538461

8648680,5,B00J81M1DQ,"THIS PRODUCTION - LOST WORLD - IS MORE ABOUT ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS AND THE OXUS RIVER THAN IT IS ABOUT ALEXANDER - BUT EQUALLY ENGAGING -- VERY WORTH WHILE!

1ST THIS PRODUCTION:  Alexander's Lost World uses Alexander more as a very loose tie to explore civilizations in Northern Afghanistan and other areas to the north and east such as Tajikistan.  In fact, it's a lot about the ancient civilizations along the Oxus river.  Many of these civilizations would have been encountered by Alexander and these interactions do figure into the narrative of this program.  We also get a look at what these civilizations would have been like long before and sometimes after Alexander passed through.  The Bactrian civilization along with it's cities factors in very heavily.  This may sound dull to some, but I have to say it is fascinating!  Afghanistan appears like a barren country of unsophisticated peoples now.  Life tends to cling to the wadies and rivers in the mountain valleys.  We see here how many of these cities were quite extraordinary for their time.  In many ways the society there might have been less backward compared to the rest of the world than the Afghanistan of today.  The cities of Ai Khanoum and Bakh were particularly extraordinary.  Aqueducts with kiln fired bricks covered large distances and were surprisingly complex.  David Adams also explores up the Oxus river to areas where Alexander would not have gone in order to find the source of the Oxus.  Along the way he discusses civilizations and battles that occurred there, including some that do claim relation back to Alexander.  The narration and graphics are also much updated and fascinating in this production as they show you representations of what these huge cities might have looked like.  The entire program begins with a through back to Jason and the Argonauts (long before Alexander) as Adams asserts that Alexander was following old routes that may have been traveled by what Adams believes was the true journey of the Argo.  It's a bit of a stretch, but certainly plausible.  It was really interesting to see many areas of the Hindu Kush as well as the Pamir Mountains where Adams ends his story.  Gorgeous, remote country!

BBC PRODUCTION - FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Footsteps-of-Alexander-the-Great/dp/B0039208QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great</a>&nbsp;This production from Michael Woods has been considered the gold standard of Alexander documentaries for entertainment.  The general scholarship is excellent, while Wood also weaves in a lot of local tradition as he travels actual paths believed to be the route of Alexander.  Some of it is still supposition, but fairly solid overall.  This program is much more faithful for those seeking specific information about Alexander's journey.  He starts from the beginning and travels as much as possible along actual routes, meeting local peoples all the way.  Some of the people Wood interviews are quite the characters!  It's amazing to see when Wood traveled these paths, Saddam Hussein was still in power in Iraq and the Taliban had not taken Kabul.  He is able to travel areas he could never go freely now, though some northern areas of Afghanistan are more restive.  The strengths of this series are also minor weaknesses.  The smaller details where he relies on local legends and personal guesses are probably not 100% correct.  But they are good theories.  Also, since he is actually traveling the paths, he also tends to be the focal point of most shots.  He is like that spot on the screen that travels with the background no matter where the camera goes (figuratively speaking).  Never the less, it is an outstanding production that has few rivals.  The US version went out of print for a bit and looks expensive.  You can get the UK release for much cheaper on Amazon UK.  However, it will only play region 2.

The focus of these two productions are really quite different and both can be watched together without crossing over an material to the point you get bored.  The BBC version is older with a lot less polish.  The Adams production is quite slick, but less about Alexander.",1408665600,21,4248,5.126637554585153
8648681,5,B00J81M1DQ,"I saw this wonderful series on TV in the UK in 2013. David Adams and his intrepid team of camera man, guides, drivers and so on take the viewer on a highly original tour of areas of the world that are rarely seen on screen, following the inspiring theory that it was once possible for the Ancient Greeks and other civilizations to sail from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea and across what are now deserts into the mountain civilizations of Afghanistan.

David Adams shows us some wonderful, awe-inspiring locations, such as uninhabited ruined cities and fortresses on sites that look very like the shores of former rivers and lakes. We see huge man-made cisterns in the middle of the empty desert, and evidence of abandoned large-scale agricultural settlements. At times it is like being on the surface of Mars, in a strange world where water once existed, but climate change has altered everything. You realise that in the days when the great histories of Alexander or Herodotus were written, when the climate was wetter, maps were highly sketchy and inaccurate, and the names of sea and rivers changed with the history of conquest and the movement of peoples, it is perfectly possible that the Greeks, including Alexander the Great, could have roamed widely by sea and river travel all over Asia: we just haven't been looking in the right places.

Other incidental pleasures of the series are its use of technology and computer graphics, and its insights into the contemporary cultures of countries like Khazakstan and Afghanistan. The main emphasis however is on re-imagining the past through travel and geographical and archaeological evidence. In a world where consumer culture and the Zeitgeist likes to persuade us that most important things are known and all information is available, this series shows us that vast areas of the planet and human history are still unknown to us, and it is perfectly possible to re-read ancient texts and established wisdom in new and exciting ways.",1406246400,12,2004,4.943620178041543
