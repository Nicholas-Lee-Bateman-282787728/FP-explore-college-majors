8705617,3,B00UGPK5JU,"I'm sure this was important when it came out, but it feels very dated to me now. It (I think maybe) tries ot insist on women having equal access tothings sexual, but it just feels like silly and bad soft porn to me mostly. The interview with Camille Paglia is fine and Annie Sprinkle is cute, but it makes me (and yes, this is a personal opinion) sad that she feels unattractive unless she camps herself up. The squeamishness people have regarding female sexual organs certainly does need to be combatted, I agree.  For me the most interesting part of the collection was the documentary on Eva Norvind ""Didn't Do It For Love"" which was buried down in the ""Extras"". All in all I would say that Seduction: The Cruel Woman is a more interesting film by Monika Treut. I'd pass on this unless you have a special interst in Paglia or Sprinkle.",1506729600,,837,4.470588235294118
