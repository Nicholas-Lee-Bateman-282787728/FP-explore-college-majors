1741945,5,B00006CXFV,"I have to confess when I first saw Andromeda I thought it was really a bad show, so I stop watching it. But at the beginning of the summer I had the chance to watch it again and I found out what a great show it was. So when I heard that it was coming to DVD I knew that I had to get it. Whoever produce the DVD did an excellent job! Unlike other shows put to DVD, Andromeda has a lot extra features, great meanus, great sound, and picture quality. Can't wait for the next volume!",1029196800,,479,3.8979591836734695
1741946,5,B00006CXFV,"I won't give details of characters and story in this review, since those are more than adequately done in other reviews.  I will say, though, that the picture and sound quality of this DVD set is so good, that it is a shame I had to see the episodes on TV channnels first.  I both saw and heard things for the first time on the DVD that I had never heard and seen in repeated watching before.  What a great DVD set!",1028937600,,415,4.036585365853658
1741947,5,B00006CXFV,"The Andromeda DVD set is truly astonishing. The picture is crystal clear. The soundtrack is properly set so that the dialogue remains understandable rather than being overpowered by sound effects or music. There are a lot of special features, including history of the Systems Commonwealth, character biographies, interviews, bloopers, commentaries, set and prop design diagrams, a making-of documentary and more.
This first DVD offering is a pleasant surprise. I hope that the rest of the series will be released with the same high amount of forethought that went into this set. Enjoy!",1028851200,7,585,5.369565217391305
1741948,4,B00006CXFV,"This is the story of Dylan Hunt, captain of the starship Andromeda.  Lost in time for 300 years, Captain Hunt leads a rag tag crew in an attempt to restore the Commonwealth of Planets and return peace the galaxy.
This is a great series! This 2 dvd set contains the first five episodes.  This is a strong dvd production.  The five episodes are presented in anamorphic widescreen.  That's an interesting but nice change since the show usually airs in full screen.  The prints are crystal clear with no signs of deterioration or flecking on the original film.  In fact, these dvd presentations are significantly better than the picture I get on my digital cable.  The picture does occasionally suffer from excess brightness.  However, this may be a symptom of the fact that the film is intended for television and was lit differently than a film that is intended to be featured in the theater.  The soundtrack is rich and full with complete use of the stereo track.  I think the soundtrack mix is actually superior to many cinematic dvd releases.  Unlike many movies that are released on dvd, the dialogue is always clear and isn't overpowered by the sound effects and score.
The extras on this two disc set are excellent as well.  There is a commentary with the director and Kevin Sorbo.  A short documentary is present with numerous production sketches, outtakes, and tv previews.  The extras really exceeded what I expected from the release of a syndicated tv show.
I'm not going to summarize the individual episodes.  The only thing that keeps this from five stars had nothing to do with the dvd quality.  Some of these early shows just contain too much plot for the one hour time slot.  The characters are really asked to develop a relationship fairly quickly and that sometimes feels compressed in these early episodes.  As a general fan of the show, I can say that you don't get this feel in later episodes when the characters are more established.
Anyway, this is great dvd set.  A must for any fan of Andromeda.  Very clear and sharp picture.  I watched all five episodes the first night I had the dvd.  GREAT!",1027987200,8,2116,4.692934782608695
1741949,5,B00006CXFV,"Take what ""A viewer from Bay Area"" has to say with a grain of salt; the third season hasn't even aired yet. Regardless, this DVD is worth it, and I would ignore the comparisons to Star Trek. The only thing really common between the two is that they both involve great storytelling! GR Andromeda employs dynamic characters, imaginitive technology, and very good writing for the most part. Highly recommended!",1027987200,2,407,4.913043478260869
1741950,4,B00006CXFV,"""Andromeda"" began in 2000 with one of the most promising plots for a science fiction series to date: in a style vaguely reminiscent of Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation"" series, a captain finds himself and his starship stranded three hundred years in his own future, where his galaxies-spanning empire has fallen and all that stands between his universe and eternal chaos is him, his ship and a small group of only partially-willing mercenary scavengers he's managed to sign aboard for his quest.  Based on production notes and ideas sketched out by Gene Roddenberry before his death, the series has, unfortunately, failed to live up to much of his potential.  You'd be hard-pressed to tell that, though, both from these first five episodes and the way in which ADV Films has released them.
With a set of extras that should make any ""Star Trek"" fan obscenely jealous, these first two discs contain commentary for the first episode from Kevin Sorbo (the star) and Allan Eastman (executive producer), character profiles of Kevin Sorbo's character and the ship's AI (both having oddly truncated, looping video for their interviews), alternate takes with both deleted scenes and unused takes for certain segments, image and concept galleries, an A-D glossary of the Commonwealth and the High Guard (the galaxies-spanning empire and their primary military force) - presumably E-Z will follow in increments with the remaining volumes, promos for each episode and teaser trailers for the series, a timeline of the early Commonwealth (covering the first three thousand or so years), an interview with Robert Hewitt Wolfe - the then-co-executive producer and a former writer for the series, a behind-the-scenes promo for the series (mainly an introduction to the concept and the characters), specs on the Andromeda Ascendant (the titular starship) and a few other high guard ships, and a blooper reel (featuring, for some reason, Kevin Sorbo being very fascinated with the phrase, ""Would you like to see my force lance?"").  While the source of some of the data for the story's universe is not referenced and clearly some of the details were not consistent between them (there seems to be notable confusion over the crew complement of the Andromeda Ascendant and the number of galaxies the Commonwealth covers), the extras themselves are the finest I have yet seen in a TV series release on DVD.
Unfortunately, the show doesn't always live up to it's expectations, sometimes failing to dig into serious questions of morality or science fiction in favor of a good action sequence, but from listening to Kevin Sorbo, Allan Eastman and Robert Hewitt Wolfe (from whose departure the show would later suffer greatly), you get a very real sense of the love and attention given to the production of this show - much of which is probably done on a lean budget by today's standards.
Ultimately, I find it easy to forgive the show a lot of it's faults in lieu of it's B-movie charm and earnest effort to please.  The DVD release of the show is certainly well worth getting for anyone even remotely interested in the show.  Besides, these first five episodes showcase some of the show's stronger efforts - before constantly-changing scenery, costumes and behind-the-scenes personnel would threaten to turn it into ""Hercules in Space"".",1027814400,,3306,5.081031307550645
1741951,5,B00006CXFV,"This is the first season of a really well written series currently about to enter its third year.  There is speculation from fans that the wonderful setup of themes in the first and second seasons may be wasted in the third season.  While it is based on a Gene Roddenberry concept, it resembles little of that original idea or even his Trek franchise.  That makes it very refreshing.  Captain Dylan Hunt and his sentient ship survive three hundred years trapped in the event horizon of a black hole.  Without a crew, Dylan recruits the members of the salvage ship and a mercenary who attempted to take the ship as their own.  Dylan and his new crew set about getting to trust each other and rebuild the Systems Commonwealth that has fallen during his absence.  Since the fall of the Commonwealth, disorder has replaced the unity that once spanned six galaxies.  Few advancements have been made since the fall which makes the Andromeda the most powerful starship around.
Dylan's new crew includes a bunch of brilliant but aimless humans and engaging aliens.  Dylan and his crew face off with foes such as Gerentex the Nightsider, the Nietzschean Drago-Kazov Pride, the red-eyed Spirit of the Abyss, and untrustworthy allies like Elsbett Mossadim.  These as well as more characters and story arcs are introduced and explored in the second season which promises to put Andromeda in the same class with the Babylon 5 series.
While the show's limited budget is reflected in the lack of imagination and limited quantity of the costumes and the inconsistent lighting of Trance?s makeup, the space and battle special effects are great and so is the opening music theme.",1027555200,,1661,4.879003558718861
1741952,5,B00006CXFV,Season 3 hasn't even begun airing yet.  How do you know the show became ridiculous?,1027468800,,83,4.533333333333333
1741953,5,B00006CXFV,"This is a great show. It goes along with the star trek type of genre, but is different. Instead of a world of order it is chaos. A sole ship with a crew of six are trying to pull a universe together against greater foes. It has spectacular special effects and great fight scenes. This is a DVD to buy.",1027382400,3,301,4.033333333333333
1741999,4,B00006CXFV,"I am really enjoying what I've seen so far. I now have the first two vols. and I'm really getting into it.
The only problem I'm having is that every interview I've tried to watch within the ""extras"" section appears to not work. It plays for 20-30 secs and the abruptly stops and repeats from the beginning over and over like records use to do sometimes when they'd skip.  :(  I purchased the first 2 vols. at one time and this occurs on all interviews on both vols. Any suggestions?  hehe
The show? 5 stars
The DVD set? 4 stars due the the afor mentioned problem.",1049673600,,563,4.2924528301886795
1742000,5,B00006CXFV,"This show is on of the best i have seen in a long time, a must for any true Sci-Fi fan(Lxa Doig WOW got to love her) and don't forget Keven Sorbo(Hercules her rocks)",1046995200,2,165,3.8823529411764706
1742001,1,B00006CXFV,Andromeda is just another mind-numbingly meaningless show from the posthumus Roddenberry Empire of mediocrity. I can't believe he would enjoy watching the shows that have been created in his name other than the various Star Trek series where all the money and writing talent go. I can't imagine anyone having endured Earth: Final Conflict all the way through.,1041033600,2,359,5.206896551724138
1742002,5,B00006CXFV,"Yeah, chances are if you are looking for this DVD set you are already hooked on the Andromeda series.  Welcome to the club.  You already know what the other reviewers are saying.
This two DVD set has the first five episodes of Andromeda: Under the Night, An Affirming Flame, To Loose the Fateful Lightning, D Minus Zero, and Double Helix.  Also included are extras like character profiles, bloopers, behind the scenes, TV teasers, and more.
And for those who haven't seen Andromeda, it is faster and funnier than the politically correct and sanitized Star Trek (TNG), more realistic, and more believable.  Sure, there is some cheese thrown in for good measure, but it makes it even more fun.
Highly recommended, but then again, you probably already knew that.",1038268800,,759,4.90625
1742003,5,B00006CXFV,"this was the best and brightest show at it's finest. i plan to buy all the dvd collections for this show.
the show had amazing character traits for the crew and plots that kept you on the edge of your seat.
i would definetly reccommend this dvd.
tribune entertainment has really outdone themselves.",1033344000,,298,4.6415094339622645
1742004,5,B00006CXFV,"This is a good presentation of the 1st 5 episodes.  Unlike some series the 5 eps fit nicely onto the DVDs without severe interlacing or compression to affect quality.  The ""force-lance"" bloopers are funny and unexpected.",1032739200,,220,5.083333333333333
1742005,4,B00006CXFV,"Since the main character is from ""Hercules"", I had my doubts.  I picked it up anyway, because Gene Roddenberry's name is on it.  I am glad I did.
The show does have some weakness- 1. Special effects are always interesting, but look fake sometimes 2. The premise seems to be a little bit shaky: why would those crew decided to join the idealist Captain? They are obviously not the noble type.
Despite those two flaws, it's still worth watching.  The concept is original (in the sense that the variation of classical theme done well), the story is good (I think ""double helix"", the last episode of Vol 1. is the best so far), acting is adequate.  In sum, the series has a promising start.  It's certainly not Farscape or Star Trek, but you'll enjoy Andromeda if you like this type of sci-fi shows.
As for DVD itself:
Good-
Many special features (alternative takes were interesting).
Good picture quality
Bad-
No subtitles...",1031875200,12,922,4.701863354037267
1742006,5,B00006CXFV,"I was skeptical when I saw yet another ""Gene Roddenberry"" apostropheed title and noticed mighty Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) as the lead character.  ""Oh, no, B-movie all the way,"" I thought.  But just for fun I rented this DVD set and was astonished at the very high standard it has set.  Andromeda is faster-paced and flashier than the most recent crop of Star Treks, and yet it is also superior in depth and breadth.  Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Majel Barrett Roddenberry and the other creative honchos have created an instant universe that is more interesting than the canonized but increasingly stale one that Star Trek perpetuates.  By starting at the end of an era (the fall of an empire) and setting out to pick up the pieces we are led through mysterious history like the fall of the Roman Empire or the disappearance of Atlantis.  The dialog is quick-witted and the characters have a lot more to say than the usual stock ""Shields at Maximum!  We're losing power!"" cliches.  Andromeda mixes the ""sexually charged negotiations"" of this old empire's barbarians (the Nietzchian fanatics) with high minded nostalgic idealism and bug-eyed monsters without making us cringe.  It is the best of scifi action-adventure and it isn't afraid to get cerebral -- the word all network executives hate.  I'm going to buy all the DVDs as they come out.",1031011200,5,1331,4.875555555555556
1742007,5,B00006CXFV,This was a fantastic DVD i loved it. I wish it had a little more about the rest of the crew in the extra's as it was mostly Kevin Sorbo but I have a feeling there will be more of them on future DVD's. I have already pre ordered the next one! The wide screen is fantastic i felt like i was watching a movie not just a TV show.,1030838400,,325,3.657142857142857
1742008,5,B00006CXFV,"I started watching Andromeda due to Kevin Sorbo, however I found that as Season 1 progressed, that the other performers were just as capable. The characters are truly likeable (or become likeable) as the season progresses. You can't help but getting wrapped up in the story. I can't wait until the next volumes are released. I had forgotten how the first shows grabbed my attention. I can't wait for the new season.",1030406400,,415,4.777777777777778

7967140,2,B00006CXFV,"I am a fan of Sorbo. I own his Hercules series, and even that couldn't get me to like Andromeda. Think, really bad special effects and some very terrible creature choices. To be fair to Sorbo ,  I'm not sure Shatner or Pine would have fared any better on that show. The first time one of them had to climb, yes climb into their cheap looking command chair that wobbled about uncontrollably, I would have laughed myself silly and turned it off.",1407456000,,443,4.402439024390244
7967141,1,B00006CXFV,"I purchased this DVD because I like Kevin Sorbo, unfortunately I couldn't play it and had to return the DVD.  The seller promply returned the purchase price.  Will Try to reorder later.",1390003200,,185,4.75
7967142,5,B00006CXFV,"Andromeda is one the best sy-fi shows to come along in a long time!

7967143,4,B00006CXFV,"Okay, the show is a bit cartoonish--the good guys vever get killed, seldom wounded or bruised.  But the cast, plot and CGI graphics make this series a winner overall.  Compared to other contemporary TV science fiction, this series stood out.  I have watched every episode of all five seasons at least once.  There are few substandard episodes.  The series was pretty consistent in quality and in following the plot/story line.  If you missed this show the first time around, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised.  If you watched it when it was first broadcast, say hello to an old friend.",1369440000,,594,4.821782178217822
7967144,5,B00006CXFV,"I had to order this DVD twice from two different vendors. The first vendor sent me episodes 106-110 in the case for episodes 101-105. Okay, I can deal with that. So, I reordered the first episodes through another vender who got the order right. In both cases, the DVDs arrived in a timely fashion, and in good shape. I am pleased!",1355011200,,330,4.426229508196721
7967145,5,B00006CXFV,"When I heard that there was going to be a new series from the creator Gene Roddenberry to be honest I was really wincing becacuse the last one was becoming very tedious but this one truly suprised me and while you may ask why are not buying the full season? because sorry to say not all seasons were stupendous however the first episodes show what the show could have been but what I like about this collection it also has the original trailers for the episodes because sometimes you may not want to admit it you  forget the episodes but the trailers really grab you and kept you for the long run.

So enjoy the first episodes of the series GENE RODDENBERRY'S ANDROMEDA",1293753600,,669,4.430894308943089
7967146,5,B00006CXFV,Amdromeda use to be a favorite tv program of mine. I enjoyed seeing this again after a very long time. I give this a very high rating.--Dan,1259107200,,139,4.185185185185185
7967147,4,B00006CXFV,"The two hour premiere is one of the best episodes of the Andromeda series.  It takes off quick, and even allows for some characterization, which many series seem to miss.  Though, as soon as the premiere ends, the series seems as if it is going to be a failure.  The third episode, ""To Looses the Faithful Lightning,"" is a ridiculous episode to be put at the beginning of the series.  But do know, that episode three isn't at all like the rest of the episodes.  Four and five are descent episodes, and they both help illuminate the character of Tyr, the Nietzschean of the crew.  If your unsure of the series, be sure to start here, at the beginning.",1064361600,,650,4.420168067226891
