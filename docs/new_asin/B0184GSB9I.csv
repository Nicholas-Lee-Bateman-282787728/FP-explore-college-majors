7539148,3,B0184GSB9I,"This is a nice fluff series, but other than the fact he is a priest who solves mysteries, it has little to do with Chesterton's Father Brown. The previous series is far closer to the character as written, so do yourself a favor and buy/rent  those instead, and ponder the original stories with a cup of tea and a fireplace. They are to be savored and treasured as masterpieces of the genre.",1491350400,,390,4.416666666666667

8741384,5,B0184GSB9I,"Father Brown Series.....This is by far my favorite series....even better than Downtown Abbey.
Mark Williams and Sorcha Cusack as Father Brown and Mrs. McCarthy are
amazing actors. We need more shows like this in the world. I really
hope there will be a Season 6. I miss Sid and Felica; but the casting
is still excellent and the story lines are incredible....very well
written.",1506038400,3,377,4.90625

8741388,2,B0184GSB9I,"I am a great fan of Chesterton and love his character, Father Brown.  His stories are full of warmth, humanity, brilliance, humility, homily and always had a great point.  This series the screenplays are not those of Chesterton, and do no have much of those things I love about them.  They are OK and better than a lot of the trash on TV today, and are pretty well done, just disappointing.",1494633600,2,390,4.464788732394366
