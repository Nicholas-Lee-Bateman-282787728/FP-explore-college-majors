8443024,4,B004V8MLEA,"The plot is quite genuine, something not attempted in Indian films before. Irfan and Juhi are hilarious and share a wonderful chemistry. Both provide the funniest moments of '7.5 Phere'. Juhi Chawla once again with her divine comedic talent shines. This time her funny character has shades of gray. While Irfan Khan plays the slightly weird but likable Manoj with ease.

To sum it up, 7.5 Phere is quite enjoyable (for most parts) and I really liked watching the comedic chemistry between Irfan and Juhi.",1304380800,,504,4.929411764705883
