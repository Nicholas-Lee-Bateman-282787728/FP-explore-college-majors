3418217,5,B0018PH3LK,"If you're familiar with Ed Burns' films and generally like them, you'll like this one.  The dialogues are rich and real-life (always a good thing) and a welcome change from the normal Hollywood-treat-me-like-I'm-a-ten-year-old type movies.  I enjoyed the style of filming especially in the few sections where there's a lot said and expressed without dialogue.  It isn't a true chick flick film...even my husband enjoyed it (which is saying a lot).  Overall A+ and a must buy.",1243296000,,475,5.12987012987013
3418218,5,B0018PH3LK,"Written by, produced by, directed by, and starring Edward Burns, one has to believe that Burns' soul is in this film.  But, for a man, this is all about Selma Blair.

This is a story of second chances, and how, through determination, perseverance, understanding, and love, we can sometimes make better choices than the first time round, and arrive at better outcomes.  But it's never easy.  Nothing that matters is easy.

The soundtrack is a series of mood pieces, and is very beautiful and soul stirring.  The characters are irreverant, needful, full of potential, always earnest (the main ones are!), and in the end triumphant (again, the ones we care about are).  All the aching sadness along the way leads to a glorious and inspiring end.

Selma Blair has a breakout role.  Her acting is inspired, captivating, and stunningly good.  She is a brilliant sunburst of energy.  If there is any justice, this role will mark the point where she emerges as a brilliant and mature actress and embarks on a long and honored career.",1241049600,11,1025,4.8
3418219,3,B0018PH3LK,"We don't often get to see Selma Blair play good roles - she took front and center in this film and did a wonderful job of acting. I love her work, but not enough films with her playing good roles - the movie didn't do her any justice by having her play a role with another woman. The movie overall has a great cast. If you have kids, I'd suggest not allowing them to see this. Also, check out the music in the film - I always wait until the end and jot them all down... and usually the soundtracks are missing the good songs - so it's off to iTunes or amazon.com to download. If you are a Selma Blair fan - or a fan of any of these actors/actresses - check out the film. Hope to see Selma in more upcoming films where she can use her talent.",1240531200,2,741,3.9466666666666668
3418220,2,B0018PH3LK,"Loving Ed Burns movies the way that I do I expected more from this movie and I was greatly dissappointed.  I loved ""Looking For Kitty"" and about the only thing that this movie has in common with that one is the music (which is very, very good). Everything else is rather boring and Debra Messing looked like a thoroughbred that was being tethered to a bad script.  There was hardly any room for her great comedic timing and Selma Blair was like watching paint dry.  So wrong for the part.  I couldn't believe that she read a book let alone could possibly write one.  Patrick Wilson was also not served well by the script and Donal Logue did the best he could with a minimal part.  Loved the British accent and was quite surpised at how well he executed it given that he always plays burly, ""New Yawk"" city toughs.  All in all, for me, it's an okay movie to catch on cable (like I did) but I wouldn't really advise buying it unless you absolutely just have to have another Ed Burns film.",1239753600,,986,4.326086956521739
3418221,1,B0018PH3LK,"Couldn't finish it. Just awful in so many ways. The story makes no sense, the dialog is beyond wooden. And could Ed please stop casting himself or take acting and voice lessons?

A painful film.",1239667200,,194,4.542857142857143
3418222,2,B0018PH3LK,"If you like films in which some of the main characters seem depressed and on the edge of falling apart most of the time, you will probably like this movie. it's very watcheable and the characters are interesting in some ways, but for me, the whole thing lacked a bit of zip. It seems to dwell terribly heavily on things like the inability of people to forgive and move on, the inability of the writers to get back to what works for them, and the inability of people to be happy. Things sort of work out in the end, but it's a bit heavy and depressing getting there.",1228521600,2,565,4.2407407407407405
3418223,2,B0018PH3LK,"cute story, but be forewarned.  if you don't mind hearing the F word about 30+ times in a movie - than this movie is for you.  it's a great story and i love the actors in it - but...a bit much - serious - it was a LOT.  i wish someone would have warned me...so - there you go!",1227657600,,276,3.6440677966101696
3418224,4,B0018PH3LK,"If you are a fan of the 'Edward Burns film', you will certainly enjoy 'Purple Voilets'.  It reminds me of 'Sidewalks of New York' in that it presents the city and surrounding locations as characters in their own right.  As a faithful viewer of all his films, the only disappointment was with the DVD itself.  My favorite part has always been listening to the director's commentary and finding out quirky specifics like why certain locations were used, or  how difficult shots were planned and filmed, or even how the guys playing the bartender is related to the production assistant.  Most people don't bother listening to these tracks but I think those of us who purchase an Edward Burns film look forward to it.  Maybe next time...",1224028800,,733,4.777777777777778
3418225,4,B0018PH3LK,"Imagine a Woody Allen film without Jazz music, without references to Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and the Marx Brothers, without existential questioning but with similar themes - broken marriages, second chances - and some similar characters (there is usually a hysterical woman in a Woody Allen film and Purple Violets has one as well).

Edward Burns, I feel, is the next director to keep an eye on. The film's plot is relatively straight-forward: two guys (Burns, Wilson), two girls (Messing, Blair), they used to know each other, are slowly coming back into each other's lives. The two guys have been friends for a long time, the two girls have been friends for a long time. Reconciliation, being true to yourself... other themes which emerge making the film lovely, solid and very approachable.

I would guest 65% of the film is devoted to Blair and Wilson's characters whereas Messing and Burns follow-through with some comedic moments. He is a recovering alcoholic, trying to put the past right and she won't forgive him for the way he was. So the sexual tension proves to bring a good balance to the depth and romance between Blair and Wilson.

If you enjoy Woody Allen or previous films by Burns (She's The One, The Brothers McMullen) you will enjoy this one. He has the pace and tone of Allen but he is becoming more of his own. I was impressed with the pace, the authenticity of emotions and the nuances. It doesn't offer typical Hollywood bullsh-t - it offers more and is probably more genuine and truer to life than the formulaic tripe slipping across our movie theatre  screens.

Definitely worth a look.",1223510400,8,1610,4.818840579710145

3418232,5,B0018PH3LK,I don't often buy DVDs but this one I had to have. I think the writing is great and the characters are imperfect but endearing. The actors all have great chemistry with each other (although I so wish Ed Burns would stop using the guy that plays Selma Blair's character's husband in his films). It's a first-love-in-college love story that you'll empathize with if you've experienced that kind of relationship in your young adulthood.,1377388800,,433,4.864864864864865

3418236,4,B0018PH3LK,"Ed Burns clearly bottomed out with Ash Wednesday and started to get back on track with ""The Groomsmen"". He clearly matured as a writer, and this growth is obvious in this movie.

I guess to sum it up, it just seems Burns is finally writing about more authentic characters, with more realistic makeups, flaws and character nuances than the caricatures he used to create for his movies.

A nice story about 2nd chances, a good cast, great locations. Give it a shot.",1355097600,,463,4.634146341463414

3418248,5,B0018PH3LK,"This has become a ""go to"" movie in my collection, and Edward Burns you need to just keep on writing movies!

There is real struggle that is dealt with from all the characters, and how we will live with past actions and what we are going to do to get to the next steps.

Some make you laugh, some make you stop and go yea, I get it, and some make you do both. He writes and directs in a way that you can really relate to the situation and the characters.  Purple violets is a great movie with the great Edward Burns touch.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone whether you are fan of Edward Burns movies or not. Very entertaining.",1270684800,,489,4.351648351648351
3418251,2,B0018PH3LK,"I was rooting for this but I can't get behind it. The characters are just cardboard cutouts and their is no point to the story. I know it's a Hollywood tradition to depict New Yorkers as living charmed lives, but none of this rang true and it doesn't even qualify as charming. I think Ed Burns needs to come down out of his penthouse and remind himself how real people live and love.",1270598400,,383,4.260273972602739
3418252,5,B0018PH3LK,"Intelligent, inspirational, well thought movie about real emotions.  If you've ever believed in love, and how time subdues emotions but never severing the suppressed feelings of a long lost love.

A fortuitious encounter at a restaurant sparks emotions, and rekindles the past.  It's about second chances, and how people change; letting go of bitterness and believing in something or someone.

As in any relationship, knowing who you are and what's important; taking time heal and getting to know yourself.  Believing in yourself and your abilities, taking chances; those who risk win.",1264204800,5,585,5.384615384615385
3418253,2,B0018PH3LK,"I just now finished viewing this film and first of all I have to admit that although being repulsed by the straw man sort of character created for the part of the husband, I remained curious enough to watch it through.  A chick flick that employs characters of upscale New York yuppie and artist types entertwangled ... I guess I'm supposed to believe that these sorts actually exist outside romantic comedy films. Whatever, I guess if you say so, my only visits were as a child or brief  waits for connecting flights so I am unqualified to say who should be how there.  However, the hand picked throw away husband I know is totally dishonest in New York or anywhere! I can't even squint back the nine years they were supposedly wed to envision a man that our lovely wife writer character ever would have even dated much less married! Trust me I am not hazarding this opinion based on his physical appearance,  I gave up long ago trying to understand what women will find as attractive in men but I do know absolutelytootly that these two would never happen ... well unlessA. it was somewhere with arranged marriage or B. she was a gal with some really deep seated head case issues ... which obviously she is neither. I believe the writer(s) of this screenplay felt somehow forced into such a severe ""straw man"" sort of match up constructed simply to be worthy of disposal. Neccessary today because of societies hearty desire to return the marriage institution to something again sacred.  I see much disapproval lately of tossing a marriage under the bus mostly to make room for the better model.  So here I see this as a lame attempt for this to somehow work for majority audience approval, But any chance at that requires a disposable spouse to be something so wrong ...like a child molester or wife beater etc but those sorts would distract horribly from a light humor infused romance film. So in my humble opinion the husband character chosen was the clumsy error that crippled this movie right off the starting block.  Take it or leave it but I say we all know in heart of hearts that marriage is a sacred thing, worthy of saving, worthy of sacrifice and not something to toss under the bus for convenience sake (or any sake in my thinking ""what God hath joined together let man not put usunder ..."" etc) Trying wrangle maneuvers to coax audience into relaxing morality is thankfully still a neat trick even in this late hour of man's history, too bad some extra thought was not invested in writing that might have avoided the issue from the start which could have done away with the completely unbelievable husband match up right from the start ... I feel for the actress trying to convince us that she is against breaking it off with hubby. With something morally acceptable and believeable this film could easily have gained the momentum to be a 4 or 5 star chick flick (which is one anyone will enjoy seeing even over and over again) ...but sadly ... NOT",1264118400,2,2963,4.589792060491494
3418254,2,B0018PH3LK,"The acting was stellar, and the casting is what enticed me to buy it. The male actors are HOT, HOT, HOT mofo's! I think the film visually had an attraction for me also. BUT. I wanted more depth and meaning in the characters and story. The character dialogue was shallow, and the story just kinda moved along without really letting you in on any real revelation. This movie had potential though. I think that if the director had spent a longer time on the actors' expressions and improvised acting, perhaps he could have done something different with the film. To tell you the truth, the film felt kinda empty. And, well, I like feeling empty sometimes.",1257984000,,652,4.629310344827586
3418255,5,B0018PH3LK,"I don't know how this movie did at the theatre but I really like it. The story line, the actors, and the timeline makes this a story that we can all relate to. Plus the music is awesome, I am in my 40's and can watch this movie over and over.",1257120000,,242,3.764705882352941
3418256,2,B0018PH3LK,"I want Ed Burns to continue to succeed as a director. I grew up in the town next to him, also had a police officer for a dad, went to Mets games, too, and so I LOVE how he loves Long Island and NYC. Like Woody Allen, his movies strive to capture that elusive atmosphere that shows you what it is that is so wonderful about NYC.
Part of what is great about NYC are its' people, straight-talking, no BS,  sometimes bordering on rude and crazy, but wonderful and unique, and missed whenever you leave the place. I think that is what Mr. Burns is trying to show with his character movies (Brothers McMullen, She's the One) , but this one didn't work. I thought Selma Blair was awful, Debra Messing was under-utilized and the best of the crew, and the other actors were mediocre at best. Ed Burns' character was real, but flat. This movie could have been saved by great acting, or, as Woody Allen knows, some comedy thrown in.
I wish him success with his next movie because he is a ballsy NY-er who isn't afraid to go for it.",1244592000,,1020,4.284974093264249

8270511,2,B0018PH3LK,"[Major Spoiler Alert] Here we go again!  Another Hollywood disappointment, even with great-looking, talented stars, who basically don't have much to do here.  Thank goodness for Debra Messing (""Kate,"" a teacher), who makes this film palatable (especially her reference to an olive branch, LOL), but unfortunately she has to share the screen with the miscast Selma Blair (""Patti"").  We learn that Patti broke up with her former college BF ""Brian"" (Patrick Wilson) and that she has always loved him.  Really?  I guess she forgot that she's been married to Chazz (Donal Logue of TV's ""Grounded for Life"") for 7 years!  Patti and Brian are both authors (with Patti selling real estate in between to ""pay the bills""), though Patti has had writer's block.  Will she get her inspiration back, and will they reconnect?  Well, the viewer really isn't given much reason to root for them, especially with their superficial laughter in a superficial rain shower, their nonexistent chemistry, and the much more attractive possibility of Kate and her old BF Michael ""Murph"" Murphy (Edward Burns) reuniting, after breaking up in college as well, with viewers probably remembering them as a couple before, in TV's ""Will and Grace.""  Murph is a lawyer and way too casually buys a 3.5 million apartment that Patti shows him (not exactly something most of us can relate to), with the ulterior motive of somehow getting Kate back, since Patti has temporarily moved in with Kate after she and Chazz have a fight, if you care (I barely did).  That being said, finding just one comedic, heartfelt, or poignant scene in the movie is a challenge, and you probably know how it ends, though the love theme called ""You Send Shivers (Up My Spine)"" that closes the movie seems more fitting for a horror film.  Only recommended (barely) for Messing fans.",1466208000,,1823,4.944262295081967
