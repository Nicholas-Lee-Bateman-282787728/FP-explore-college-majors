7905322,4,B000009CDX,"The most important thing about this DVD is that you'll wish you were there!  I can't understand the decision to ""BLEEP"" the wordy dirds.  What were they thinking?  Then, as many have said, they cut our funk!  But in the ""interviews"" they interrupted the flow of the show to present, George Clinton talks several times of how LONG the band is going to play and how they like to play LONG gigs.  The running time is just under an hour!  All of this makes me wonder if they couldn't re-release this without the bleeps and with all the music that must have been left on the cutting room floor.  Maybe while they're at it, they could work with the sound some... (sometimes the vocals are too far in the back) and run the credits AFTER the show on a black screen instead of over the performance.  I guess my main point is that this looks to have been an outstanding show, with everybody feelin' the funk, and the problems that exist could be remedied with a re-issue.  I've got my fingers crossed that somebody's gonna get right on that.",1345766400,,1031,4.412698412698413
7905323,2,B000009CDX,"Did you see poor Michael Hampton frowning in the background, wondering 'why am I here'? For one of the great guitar bands to release a DVD with NO guitar solos is a crime. For one of the greatest harmony groups to release a DVD where the voices are completely inaudible is another crime. And the last crime ... the greatest funk band ever should NOT attempt to do rap. The Mothership Connection DVD is much better.",1049241600,3,414,4.4605263157894735
7905324,4,B000009CDX,okay so you don't get the funk uncut still if you love p funk and george clinton you must have this since there are very little stuff about p funk on tape get this and the mothership video keep the funk alive ya'll.,1047859200,3,215,4.023255813953488
7905325,5,B000009CDX,"This concert was a hodgepodge of the P-Funk Allstars.  Some old, some new.  Some of the original Funkiadelics are RIP.  But, it still was FUNKY for the TRUELY TRUE FUNKATEER.",1004054400,5,174,4.733333333333333
7905326,2,B000009CDX,"When I ordered this concert, I had hoped that it would be as good as the Mothership Connection Concert DVD. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed as soon as I saw the length of the concert and the interviews with George  between the songs. To make matters Worse the production of this concert  SUCKS, whomever edited this concert and had the Bright Idea of messing up  the flow of the Funk by mixing interviews between jams obviously doesn't  have any appreciation for the Funk George Clinton& the P-Funk are known  for. This is almost as bad as the editing of their set at Sinbad's Summer  Jam on HBO.",922406400,23,600,4.5607476635514015
7905327,3,B000009CDX,"George Clinton is great but this production stinks.  Example: Clinton is rapping and says a few bad words and they bleep over the entire sound track!!!  Also, the production fades from the musical performance to an  interview with Clinton, in the midst of songs....  The end is abrubt;  they  roll the credits and when done they just stop the music.  Who in the hell  produced this.  They should be banned for life.  I unfortunately paid $23  for my copy (not thru amazon) but at the amazon price it is worth owning.  There are plenty of cool parts in this DVD, just expect some rough edges.",919814400,9,591,4.523809523809524
7905328,2,B000009CDX,"This 1996 concert took place in Atlanta's House of Blues around the time of the Olympics. By any other standard, they performed well, but the expectations they carry as the world's best R&B touring band now works  against them somewhat.  A much better selection is the Mothership  Connection tour (1977) which is also available on DVD.  Defections and  Father Time have taken their toll on this group but they gamely funk on.  It's what they do.  Songs include Flash Light, One Nation Under A Groove,  Mothership Connection (Starchild), and Atomic Dog.  True Funkateers will  want this for their collection but the casual fan should pass.  If you view  the 1977 show and the 1996 show back to back, it looks like a say no to  drugs ad.",917913600,8,735,4.692913385826771
