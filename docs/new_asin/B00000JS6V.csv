8270404,5,B00000JS6V,"This Winstar/Audio Galaxy release is simply splendid. On this disc, you will be amazed by the colorful characters and variety of animation (fully restored, looking better than they have in years), old favorites stop by too, like Popeye and Betty Boop. This disc also contains some great efforts of some animation legends like Chuck Jones (Robin Hood Makes Good)and U.B Iwerks (Tom Thumb), each cartoon is crystal clear, and sound is superb as always. Audio Galaxy has also gone through the trouble of inserting historical notes for each cartoon throughout the disc. My advice, toss out your old VHS of these shorts and buy this wonderful collection, You will be glad you did.",1413244800,,675,4.982300884955753
