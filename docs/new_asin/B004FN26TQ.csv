8603291,5,B004FN26TQ,"This is a wonderful video of a unique archeological find, and the writers show how clues to past seismic events discovered by in the now-uncovered Byzantine harbor in Istanbul are of value to the engineers building the tunnel under the Bosphorus -- itself a push-the-envelope piece of civil engineering. The footage of Istanbul is stunning (as someone who has spent a lot of time in that most beautiful of cities, I love seeing it onscreen) and the historical recreations are extremely detailed and well done, giving viewers a feel for the period. National Geographic produces high-quality material, and this is yet another gorgeously-filmed offering. For anyone interested in Byzantine history, marine archeology, or state-of-the-art civil engineering projects, this video is of high interest.",1355788800,,794,5.463414634146342
