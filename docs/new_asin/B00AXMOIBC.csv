5526354,5,B00AXMOIBC,"This was my second time doing this dvd and even though I begged for mercy during all the moves on all fours,I felt so sweaty and energized after. I have so many dvds and workout daily but until I discovered Tonique I was so discouraged that nothing I did helped me tone up my trouble spots-thighs and belly. I am 46 with 3 kids and I truly believe that Sylwia is going to work her magic on my middle aged body! I love her enthusiasm and wish I could bottle her energy-I have to modify some of her moves,as I'm not Superwoman like her but I give it my all!!I have all of her dvds and have never found a better program then Tonique and I've tried many-Cathe,Tae Bo,Jari Love,Jillian Michaels,Physique 57 and quite  a few others. Many of those collect dust now that I discovered Sylwia!",1367280000,6,783,4.326530612244898
5526355,5,B00AXMOIBC,"An earlier reviewer has given an excellent breakdown so i won't repeat that. i did Tracy anderson for ayear before becoing a toniquer. Energy mat(EM) reminds me a little bit of glutecentric and Tracys leg lifts. The difference is excellent cuing, there are some leg lifts and moves i'v never seen and Sylwia really woirks your arms. love this workout. highly recommended.
If your wrists start hurting i'd suggest holding on to your light weights while you're on the mat.
Enjoy",1365811200,9,476,4.888888888888889
5526356,5,B00AXMOIBC,"I have all of Sylwia's dvds and this one is my absolute favorite of hers!  The breakdown above was right-on.  It is a wonderful workout and keeps heart rate up!  Unlike above reviewer, I do like Cardio Mat.  Tonique 2 is probably my least favorite only because it is too hard for me!

Get this one!  It's great!",1365724800,4,311,4.275862068965517
5526357,5,B00AXMOIBC,"I've had this for over two weeks, but have put off doing it because, to be honest, I was a little scared of how hard it would be!  :-)  I just got done doing it for the first time, and absolutely loved it!  It is full of fun, creative moves, and the 64 minutes of it just flew by for me.

I have all of Sylwia's Tonique workouts but just haven't clicked with her Cardio Mat workout, which is my least favorite Tonique.  This new Energy Mat workout has a different feel to it than Cardio Mat, and I like it a lot more.

The entire workout is just over 64 minutes long, and all you need is a mat, which makes this perfect for travel.  At the very end, the workout moves right into the bonus Energy Stretch workout, which is a 30-minute dynamic stretching routine.  (It's the same Energy Stretch workout that's also included on her new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonique-Born-to-Move-with-Sylwia-DVD/dp/B00B04KZ5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonique Born to Move with Sylwia DVD</a>&nbsp;workout.)

I brought my laptop into my workout room with me as I did this today so I could take notes on the workout and provide a breakdown of it.

* First 23 minutes -- work on all fours --  For the first 23 minutes of Energy Mat, you'll be on all fours, doing variations of side leg lifts, donkey kicks, etc.  This section reminds me of Tracy Anderson's Hipcentric, in that there are a lot of variations of leg lifts.  From past experience, I've found that this type of work on all fours targets not only your legs and glutes, but also your arms and core since you're holding yourself up for so long.

* Minutes 23-34 -- leg moves on knees then back to all fours --  At minute 23, you'll come up on your knees for a few minutes to do so some leg work, before going back on all fours to do other side to complete some of the exercises. You'll spend another 7 minutes on all fours, before moving into a short plank and burpee  series.  In total, you spend the first 34 minutes on all fours, which put a bit of strain on my wrists, so be careful if you have weak wrists.

* Minutes 34-52 -- bridge work --  After the first 34 minutes, Sylwia has you move to your back for bridge for about five minutes to really work your glutes.  Then she moves into working your core while still on your back.  This section has a lot of really unique moves that I have never seen before!  For instance, at one point, she has you balance in a one-legged bridge, and then you move the other leg below the balancing leg to really get into your glute.  There are also some fun variations on V-sits that target the core.

* Minutes 52-1:04 -  misc. moves -- At 52 minutes in, you'll move to all fours again for 3 minutes of push-up-type work.  The she has you sit and stretch for a bit, before moving into a few minutes each of mountain climbers, low squats, and side-lying leg extensions.  After the leg extensions, you'll do a quick stretch.

* Minutes 1:01-1:04 -- cardio moves --  At 1:01, Sylwia will have you end with one last section of cardio.  You'll do some side to side jumps (with your hands on the mat), some push-ups, and then end with some freeform dancing, in the spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonique-Sculpt-Dynamics-with-Sylwia-Weisenberg/dp/B006WPDFD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonique Sculpt Dynamics with Sylwia Weisenberg</a>. This is the only segment of the entire workout where you don't either have at least one hand or your back or side on the floor; it's essentially done upright.

The workout ends a bit suddenly, with Sylwia lying on her mat and giving a thumbs-up sign.  It moves directly into the Energy Stretch section, but since I was pretty tired at that point, I just did a few minutes of stretching on my own.

Basically, for the entire workout except for the last few minutes, you'll have one or both hands or your back on the floor at all times.

The music is non-vocal electronica, and some of it was familiar from Born to Move.

Sylwia speaks in a voiceover throughout the workout, and she has excellent cueing, so you don't have to keep watching the screen, especially when you're on all fours.  This is a nice change from some other workouts that don't do this (I'm looking at you, Tracy Anderson! :-) ) There were only a few times during the bridge sequence where I couldn't quite see what she was doing with her legs and would have liked a bit more guidance.  She also doesn't talk as much in this one as she does in Born to Move, and I wish she would have since I love her encouraging words; they always motivate me to work out harder.

This is called Energy Mat for a reason -- my heart rate stayed elevated the whole time, especially during the work on all fours.  A lot of the exercises also incorporate movements where you feel like you are stretching while working out.  I really liked this element of the workout!

Overall, this is another fun, unique workout from Sylwia!  The only problem is that I can't wait for another new Tonique workout to come out!",1358294400,25,5075,4.637178051511758
8558911,5,B00AXMOIBC,"Wow I love this workout.  A lot of repetitions, but very effective.  I also like Sylwia.",1484784000,,88,4.4375
8558912,4,B00AXMOIBC,"I definitely feel it.  Sylwia is no joke.  I do the mat workouts since the standing ones have too much knee-heavy work. The workouts are based on intensity and repetition, so it's challenging to my ADD--but definitely feels like a deep workout for your backside.",1455494400,,262,4.8
8558913,4,B00AXMOIBC,"Great routine, loved the whole workout.",1440892800,,39,5.666666666666667
8558914,5,B00AXMOIBC,this is an advanced full body workout. I popped this in just now thinking i would do an easy mat routine. I was wrong. She isn't playing around in this one (or any of them). It's a great full body workout. It might be hard on some wrist~prop them up on some weights...,1440633600,,268,4.0754716981132075
8558915,4,B00AXMOIBC,I like this DVD.  Targets the butt and legs and you hit these areas from every corner.  I don't find these boring -- I concentrate on the exercises and the burn and feel the areas i've worked from every corner.,1419552000,,210,4.225
8558916,3,B00AXMOIBC,"This was a tough review to write.  I love exercise and love to work hard to change my body.  That being said, I want to look forward to my exercise session.  I know that every session can't be all fun and games, but this workout has somewhat of a dread factor for me.  That is why I only rated it 3 stars.

The workout is broken down into two main sections:

* Energy Mat (64 minutes)
The focus is on your legs, glutes and core.  You do a little bit of upper body work, but the main focus is lower body.

* Energy Stretch (25 minutes)
Don't let the ""stretch"" in the title fool you.  You are still working hard; you just seem to flow from dynamic stretching into a more strenuous exercise.

First let me tell you what I liked about this workout.  The things I liked:

* Sylwia. She seems like a very sincere and down to earth person.  She is someone I'd love to sit and have coffee with.  At one point in the workout she says, ""I am so sorry that I am not smiling.  I usually smile a lot, but I find I smile too much for the camera.""

* The minimal talking.  Most barre/fusion workout instructors chatter constantly during the entire workout. They give lots of form pointers, but they talk too much and I find myself tuning them out most of the time.

* The unique exercises.  There were several moves that I have never seen before and this kept my interest.  Even though I wasn't always sure exactly which muscle I was supposed to be working, my legs, glutes and core felt pleasantly sore the next day.

* The short dance pieces at the end of the mat workout and again at the end of the energy stretch.  I wish there had been more of these types of moves.  I love how they get my blood flowing.

Now, on to what I didn't like about this workout.

* It's boring.  I think it's because you do about a million reps for each exercise.  Well, okay it's not really a million reps, but it sure feels like it.  Slywia is very low key, which is fine, but it doesn't make for an energizing exercise session. The set is very plain and dark, plus it's just Slywia.

* Not enough form pointers.  I know I said I didn't like a lot of instructor chatter, but I think it would have been helpful if Sylwia gave a few more alignment tips.  With high rep exercises like these, it's all too easy to get into a trance and just go through the motions.

* I didn't really feel my muscles working on some of the exercises.  I wonder if it was because my form was off.  A few exercises where you are on all fours and you bring one leg down across the other really bugged me because I kept hitting my sneaker of the bended leg.  Maybe next time I'll try these particular exercises without shoes.

I would suggest watching clips of this before purchasing to see if you will enjoy Slywia's style.  This is the first Tonique workout that I have tried, so I can't compare it to Slywia's other workouts.",1401753600,8,2872,4.184643510054845
8558917,5,B00AXMOIBC,"I am huge fan of ms wiesenberg, and own most of her workouts. I love this mat workout, I think it is a lot more fun and effective than her previous mat workout. The moves are creative, a challenge, and most importantly, very effective. Your butt and legs will be on fire. Your arms get a decent workout as well as you are on your hands and knees for a good 30 minutes. She is extremely motivating, her cueing is great and she looks amazing at the same time:) i've alternated sylwia with tracy anderson after I had my third baby in last week of july, and the results so far I won't complain about! Try this, try and sylvia wiesenberg, you will get hooked, I did! Ps i don't know what people are talking about that you can't understand her through her accent, I have ZERO problem understanding her, she speaks excellent, articulate English and I wish I spoke another language so fluently.",1387324800,5,886,4.408536585365853

8558919,2,B00AXMOIBC,"I workout almost every day.  I enjoy the barre work including the Dailey Method, Lotte Berk, Booty Barre, etc.  I also enjoy weights and intense cardio.  From previous reviews, my expectations were that this would be a good ""ramped up"" version of barre work.  I found it repetitive and boring.  Understand the need for high reps, but it was so hard to try to stay interested in this video.  Wish I could return...",1379894400,3,413,4.589041095890411
8558920,5,B00AXMOIBC,"I'm almost 60. I do bar workouts and lower impact aerobics, but I wanted a video to cause muscle confusion and get my heart rate up. (bigger movements to rotate with the bar workouts.) This workout is really fun and unique, and I know I am going to have a very sore butt tommorrow. This workout is also very advanced, as far as I'm concerned. I am probaly old lady intermediate. Sometimes I couldn't complete all the reps, but I put in the effort. Something to challenge me. Also some of the running planks were very hard for me, but all in all I love this workout. I got sweaty and tired, and feel as if I worked out hard. I did my own stretches at the end. I am glad I have been doing Callenetics, Bar Method, Pure Barre, and Core Fusion before I tried this, as I might not have known how to hold my pelvic girdle and core tight and might have hurt my back. The music is very energetic and makes the workout more fun. Sylwia is young enough to be my daugther and I will probaly never have buns like her, but we can all dream right. She is encouraging and enthusiastic and I like her accent. If you like unique and very challenging moves try this workout, but don't be too hard on yourself if you can't do it all, like I mentioned before its something to work up to.",1375747200,10,1267,4.154471544715447
