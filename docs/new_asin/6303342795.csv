625919,5,6303342795,"This tape continues the adventures of Nuku Nuku who looks like a normal 17 year old high school girl, but is really an android with the brain of a cat.  The story deals with a custody battle between a mother(mama san) and a father(papa san) over their son. The mother is the president of Mishima Heavy Industries which is an electronics company that basically makes everything you could imagine.  The father left because he did not want his technology used for war.  In the third episode Nuku Nuku tries to get mama san and papa san to live together again and in the fourth episode Nuku Nuku meets another android who wants to take over Nuku Nuku's body.  This is my favorite anime series and one of the best comedy anime ever.",979084800,,727,4.484848484848484

7843744,5,6303342795,"There are 3 volumes. Great show! Action, romance, sci-fi, wrapped up in a wonderful story. While it's been around some time, it's very well done. Don't let the lack of current animation tech keep you away from this gem!",1442188800,,219,4.641025641025641

7843746,4,6303342795,"I don't know why all these companies are reworking old titles, but when I heard that Nuku-nuku was being remade, I decided to give it a try.
After seeing all three volumes I can give it the best recomendation of all: It switches on big cliche -- the main character of the story is a guy who is tortured by unrequited love for the a beautiful girl and spends the series chasing her.  But even still, it is very funny has some great mecha designs and art and a decient story.
I just wish it was a bit cheaper.",1075939200,2,507,4.121212121212121
7843747,4,6303342795,"This is volume 2/3.
The husband-wife battle over the technology that is Nuku Nuku heats up, just as Nuku Nuku starts to learn what it means to be human.  Ironic twist in this custody battle over ""property.""  Instead of joining in the battle, Nuku Nuku tries to patch things up.  Will this win her the respect of her ""Mother""?
Adding to the mix is a new android for a rival, Eimi.  Very cute android, but not nice like Nuku Nuku.  The two have interesting ""competitions"" until a major threat to a family member becomes more of a challege in and of itself.  This volume is a bit like Project A-ko, where A-ko and B-ko battle all of the time.
Lots of fun in this volume.  A true anime classic.",1015459200,,690,4.3023255813953485
7843748,5,6303342795,"This is volume 3/3.
Nuku Nuku matures into the ideal older sister in this one.  It's very touching how she takes care of her brother.  She's gone beyond her father's wildest dreams of a companion for his son.
The highlight of this entire series is when Nuku Nuku works as a waitress.  She's cute and sweet, so she becomes something of a restaurant idol star.  Unfortunately, those out to capture her turn the restaurant into a battle zone.  All I'll say is that there's a hilarious catnip scene,  You'll want to see it unspoiled.
This is an ideal tape to watch if you're feeling sad and depressed.  Such is the charm of Nuku Nuku, you will cheer up right away!",1015459200,,660,4.45
