3465095,4,B001AR4K6C,"Get Thrashed is a documentary on, you guessed it, the phenomenom that was and IS thrash metal. Now it didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know about thrash, but it was very enjoyable to hear the music legends talk about a genre they obviously cared alot for. One drag was that I had to listen to bands like Shadows Fall, Corey Taylor, Lamb Of God, and Hatebreed give their opinions. But it wasn't a big distraction form the overall film. They interview every band you'd think should be in there, and the bonus features covers any they missed, with the exception of a few,(Demolition Hammer). All in all, I enjoyed this film alot, and am glad to have it in my collection.",1221782400,17,682,4.508064516129032
3465096,5,B001AR4K6C,"'Get Thrashed' is an intimate look into the genre that started most other types of extreme metal. A well rounded documentary produced and directed by metal fans and musicians(Rick Ernst and Rat Skates) that taps into the origins of thrash, it's somewhat demise in the mid 90's and now it's resurgence in the mid 2000's. Everyone you would expect see in the film you do. The BIG 4 or even now 5 as Exodus is also included as pioneers of the great underground movement. And it was very underground as most realize. There was a tape trading phenomenon and this was the core behind the movement. Not to mention some great bands.
The film also looks into the other thrash movements across the world. Notably,Canada,Germany and Switzerland. Also included is the crossover point where thrash and hardcore blend together. You hear about Suicidal Tendencies,D.R.I.,S.O.D. and others that incorporated these sounds that developed into new genres.
Many famous people are interviewed not to mention some lesser known folks that offer insight into the realm that is thrash. There is also some really great pictures that are flown throughout the film and ofcourse great background music. Running at about 99 minutes you really get your fill of the genre.
Then the special features continue the majesty. With even more interviews and knowledge from bands I have never even heard of. This film is truly a knock out of the park. So if you are a fan of heavy metal especially a fan of thrash this film was made for us. And I am extremely thankful. It made me feel like a kid again.
HORNS UP THRASHERS!!!!",1221782400,25,1586,4.791970802919708
3465097,5,B001AR4K6C,"I have been waiting for this for a loooong time and it is by far the best documentary ever! I relived many memories watching this. The documentary is very well done, edited and the songs are insane. This is an absolute must for every metal fan!",1221609600,13,244,4.326086956521739
3465098,5,B001AR4K6C,"Speaking as someone who was part of the thrash scene from around 1984 to 1990, I can safely say that this documentary kicks @#$%ing ass. It's about as in-depth as you could get in the space of 90 min. or two hours or however long it is. If I have any complaint, it's that they spend almost zero time on the ""punk"" side of thrash, the hardcore side. DRI make a couple of extremely brief appearances and COC is at least mentioned, but other than that this is almost entirely focused on the metal side of thrash. They really gloss over the fact that it was a bona fide crossover scene, with punks and metal heads meeting in the middle. This was something none of us saw coming in 1982. Back then we thought our two sides would be at war for eternity.

While the earlier roots of Motorhead, Venom and the NWOBHM are briefly acknowledged, this pretty much starts with Metallica and goes from there. It's bursting with tons of footage and photos from 80s thrash gigs, and it was a real pleasure to mosh down memory lane. The bonus features cover even more bands, a lot of bands that I knew of but never got to hear, and even a couple of bands that I was never even aware of... which is impressive, if I may say so myself. Unfortunately, the bonus section doesn't feature any actual music, so I'm now finding myself buying here at Amazon and eBay so I can find out what I missed. And finally, I also value this doc because, being so out of touch with today's music scene, I had no idea that there was a sort of Thrash 2.0 scene happening right now, new bands who hate nu metal as much as I do. I might have to run out and buy an amp and get back on the horse.

Heavily recommended to anyone who was part of the 80s thrash scene or is interested in it after the fact. The makers of this doc did a stellar job.",1221350400,2,1801,4.172413793103448
3465099,5,B001AR4K6C,"Fantastic film.  The story of thrash from the musicians, DJ's, industry people, and fans who were there.  It has a strong focus on the American scene, but that's okay.

3465100,5,B001AR4K6C,"Just watched this documentary and was completely blown away. It's very in depth and there's not much they don't touch on. I'm sure everyone will have some band that they wish could've been discussed more (Testament, Pantera) but they do acknowledge pretty much all the vital bands to this beloved music scene. There's no genre of music that's more deserving of its story being told than the thrash metal scene of the 80s and this is a very informative and fitting tribute. I'll spare you a chapter by chapter review but if you were around and had your eyes and ears open during this special time you'll definitely appreciate this DVD. Highly recommended... Even with Dave Mustaines arrogant comments. *****",1426896000,,706,4.891666666666667

3465113,5,B001AR4K6C,"Back in the early 2000's I heard that a documentary on Thrash Metal was being made. I could not have foreseen how long it would take for me to see it but finally by the end of 2008 I had a copy of this DVD in my hands. Who ever considers him or herself a true thrasher must have a copy of GET THRASHED. It's hard for any documentary to fully embrace and review the whole scene so some lesser known bands have been omitted but the key players are fully covered. People tend to forget that METALLICA basically kick started the scene and you get commentaries from people who were in the thick of it: Brian Slagel (founder of Metal Blade Records), Johnny and Marsha Zazula (founders of Megaforce Records), Ron Quintana (Radio DJ and Fanzine editor), Slayer, Kreator, Harald O (close METALLICA friend), etc. The so called ""BIG FOUR"" are extensively covered here; SLAYER, MEGADETH, ANTHRAX and of course, METALLICA. EXODUS is also given plenty of time as well as TESTAMENT and OVERKILL (whose original drummer, Rat Skates, Co-produced this project). Bands and people talk about how the movement started, where the influences came from, how was life on the road, the underground tape trading, scenes from other countries (specially Germany!),etc. Newer bands like LAMB OF GOD, THE HAUNTED, MESHUGGAH, SHADOWS FALL, KILLSWITCH ENGAGE and MUNICIPAL WASTE express how these thrash metal bands influences their own bands. As with any genre, sometimes it's difficult to tell when a style of music stops and another one begins. While bands like MERCYFUL FATE and ANVIL are discussed as ""thrash"", other bands like Germany's HELLOWEEN and RAGE are completely overlooked. FATE and ANVIL were essential in the development of thrash metal, but were more akin to conventional or classic metal like PRIEST or MAIDEN. Then you have people raving about NASTY SAVAGE and then saying METAL CHURCH and AGENT STEEL were NOT thrash. NASTY SAVAGE were in essence a ""thrash"" band that played slow, which is contradictory to the genre, while METAL CHURCH and AGENT STEEL made some very classic thrash albums, in their own particular styles.

Minor complaints aside, GET THRASHED is the definitive look at thrash metal. You'll get your METALLICAS, KREATORS, ANTHRAXs, SODOMS, DESTRUCTIONS, SLAYERS, MEGADETHS, etc. This is and will be the only documentary of the genre that we'll have for a long, long time!",1303603200,3,2376,4.969849246231155

As one who spent almost every weekend in the mid-80's at L'amour's in Brooklyn where Anthrax and Overkill were practially the house bands, it was awesome to be able to re-live that scene.  There are some great interviews and commentary from the ""legends"" of thrash metal, as well as a pretty true description of the entire scene, from the music to the clothing to the attitude.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who woke up one day and wondered, ""where did that music go?""  For a true thrasher, grunge just didn't cut it - it totally lacked the energy, the passion, and the testosterone of real metal.

3465118,4,B001AR4K6C,"Get Thrashed: The Story of Thrash Metal (Rick Ernst, 2006)

I'll say this right out: this is a movie for those of you who were there. If you're trying to get an objective look at the history of thrash, you would be well-served to go elsewhere. (Where, I'm not sure, but this is not the movie that will give it to you.) This is a by the fans, for the fans, kind of gig, and in that respect, it's great. Lots of band footage, lots of interviews with people you probably didn't know were still alive, lots of horns-in-the-air headbanging metal. If Paul Baloff's immortal ""there's blood upon the stage"" line was real to you, and you still have the scars to prove it, you're going to get just as much a kick out of this as I did.

There's really not much else I can say about this. If you were a part of the scene, it's an absolute must-see. I wish they'd covered a few more bands (and I won't name names, because I'm sure every thrash fan will have a list, and they'll all be different), but what's here is pure gold.*** ",1242950400,,1017,4.205128205128205

Note that this was not produced by film makers, so it's a little rough around the edges, but certainly worth seeing whether you enjoy this kind of music or not.",1240185600,,464,4.602409638554217
3465131,5,B001AR4K6C,"I have seen just about every Metal documentary out there and this one is the best.  It's focus is on the sub-genre of Thrash Metal but branches a bit into other extreme music styles as well.  They really did their research, interviews and due diligence here.  I can't believe the amount of information contained in this opus.  I learned quite a bit and I thought I knew just about everything.  The number of pictures (over 800), albums covers shown, and band members interviewed is astounding.  I watched everything (film, special features, commentary) and realized there are quite a few Thrash bands I have never heard.  It made be want to delve into some of the lesser known bands like Kreator, Sodom, Raven etc.  Their coverage of the early days in the Bay Area and Los Angeles was great.  They explained in great detail the early history of Thrash.  Which is basically the early history of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Exodus.  Loved the film!

3465135,5,B001AR4K6C,"Get Thrashed is a very entertaining and very informative documentary on the 80s Thrash scene.  Many Metal documentaries get complaints from certain folks coz ""X"" band was not mentioned or covered.  Get Thrashed is rather well researched and covers quite a bit of ground.  It begins with Thrash's beginnings, the bands, the scene, the fans, it's downfall, and ultimately it's resurrection and influence on recent bands(it it nice to hear younger more recent bands speak so highly of these old thrash groups, it's just unfortunate that they didn't seem to learn much from them).  The film is 99 minutes, so it does go into depth.  The big four Thrash bands are covered, but many more obscure bands are given their due.  Lots of interviews and commentary with bands old and new.  There really isn't enough time to go into every Thrash band in history, but that's where the Bonus Features come in.  The Bonus Feature is a world map where you can highlight a particular country or city and get a short description of the scene and/or the bands from that particular area.  This is a wonderful addition because it can bring to your attention some bands you may have never heard of.  Plus it helps in the ""this band wasn't mentioned"" category that Metal fans tend to get so picky about.
Naturally it goes without saying that this documentary will only appeal to a certain crowd.  I can't see the average Bowling For Soup fan getting much out of this, but you never know.  But this is highly recommended to the metal fans, even the younger ones so they can see where this whole thing came from and who the masters are.  I can't imagine too many metal fans will find many flaws in this film.

In the main documentary and in the extra footage they hit just about all of the major thrash bands of the time. I definitely enjoyed seeing this and recommend it to any thrash fans.

This is a great video view into the beginings of Thrash, on the west, and east coasts... Interviews with Thrash legends like Overkill, Slayer, Death Angel, Exodus, Anthrax, Testament, and new thrash acts like Municpal Waste, ans Evile bring the Thrash right to your face, so close up, and personal, you can almost SMELL the stale beer, and sweat...

Begining with the west coast, bands like Metallica, Slayer and Exodus, the video delves into the roots of Thrash, and how the hair bands, and the punks had shunned the early Thrash bands, forcing Metallica to move north to the Bay Area, joining the Bay masters, Exodus, in creating the mighty metal scene there... Slayer stayed in LA, bludgeoning the ""posers"" into submission... when Metallica flew to New York, eventually sending Dave Mustaine packing, and bringing in Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet, New York bands like Anthrax, and New Jersey's Overkill welcomed them into a huge scene of thier making...

This vid is fantatic if you are a fan of Thrash, or even just the New York metal scene back then, as the bonus features delve into the crossover bands, and New York hardcore...

It took me back to the music I listened to that wasn't on the radio, wasn't in the major chain of record stores. I had to travel to college towns with my lunch money to pick up the latest Metal imports, that's exactly where this DVD took me.
GT Covers the New York & California scene, and gives props to the San Francisco Bay Area, where Thrash really thrived. They show the music crossover into Hardcore Punk, They show the origins of the biggest bands, and interview the great smaller ones as well. The extra features go on a nationwide clickable map where you can go from city to city to check out that area's scene, which has as much footage as the movies itself.

My only complaint isn't much of one - They cover John & Marcia Z. of Megaforce records & Metal Blade from the west coast, but nothing was mentioned of COMBAT records. Oh, and Phil Anselmo from Pantera was too stoned to hold the Microphone. I'm leaving out a bunch, but you need to own this if a fan at all.

The production is not as good, nor does it compare with Metal: A headbanger's Journey level of stars, but it is still excellent in getting the energy through. There is a Heavy Focus on the L.A./Bay Area because of the Big 4 (5 with Exodous), and only one of them being from New York (Anthrax).  Sure there is a nod to Overkill as well (with Rat Skates being on board with this project). This does a bit of tracking across the USA and into the world scene during the film, and the bonus features try to include the rest.  They bands do give plenty of credit to the fans and their loyalty, and this movie does bring back that rush of feelings I had the first time I heard Megadeth and Anthrax.  It's great to see a resurgence of the sound kept alive today with a crisp new take on thrash with bands Municipal Waste and Toxic Holocaust.  It is fan loyalty from the original wave 25 years ago that brought this film to life and relavent again, and that message is clear throughout this film.  METAL FOR METALHEADS!

You just HAVE to get this DVD if you're a Metal and especially a Thrash Maniac. I really do hope that the makers will do more research in the international Metal-Scene.

If you were around to experience the music and the scene back then or if you are a metal fan of any kind...this is a must see. Great music, interviews and footage/pictures featuring some of the greatest bands of all times. The only reason why I'm giving it only 4 stars is that there is a little too much Metallica bashing. Just because they evolved and became successful they are everyone's favorite whipping boys nowadays. Yes, they get credit and props in the beginning of the movie for Kill `em all and pioneering the movement out of the underground but there are several shots taken at them throughout the whole documentary. Especially Dave Mustaine running his mouth about how great his is and how he is responsible for Metallica's and, get this, Slayer's success...ummm, yeah. Ride the Lightning,  Master Of Puppets and ...and Justice for all get little to no mention at all although they are arguably some of the best and most important thrash records period. Hate Metallica all you want but if you are going to do a documentary about thrash keep your bias out of it. They are the band that still holds the metal flag up high and influenced new bands and brought new fans to the genre while most thought it was dead. What's more like selling out...sounding exactly the same over and over again with what made you successful (like Slayer) or taking risks and evolving your music even if it pisses people off? Anyway...the documentary is awesome and highly recommended for all fans of heavy music.",1222560000,3,1636,4.660899653979238
