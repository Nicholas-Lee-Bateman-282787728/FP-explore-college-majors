7025958,5,B00TYN7IGI,This trilogy was amazing and I suggest any fan of the series should own this. I can say I've only seen the subtitled english version of these movies and cannot comment on what the dubbed version is like.

7025963,4,B00TYN7IGI,"They did a really good job turning the anime into a film trilogy, considering how much the series had to be condensed in order to fit it into six hours. I had a really good time watching these movies, having been a long-time Kenshin fan.",1489104000,,237,4.288888888888889

7025968,4,B00TYN7IGI,"Got this for Christmas was super excited! The movies are great.  The subtitles are pretty good missing a couple things here and there,  and the timing is a little fast.
  The region code doesn't work in my DVD player or my computer however it worked fine in my Xbox one",1485907200,,269,4.32
7025969,5,B00TYN7IGI,"This trilogy is very nice. Great soundtrack for the sword fighting and the emotional trilling scenes (Loved the scene where Kenshin tells Cho how much the baby meant in the new era Kenshin had created). The plot maybe a bit different from the anime in some parts ( They can't replicate everything in the anime). However, it was nothing to complain as they made sure to let the viewers know what happened. Overall very satisfying trilogy of the anime Rurouni Kenshin.",1485734400,,466,4.765432098765432

Although the item is a bit expensive, it is a wonderful gift for people interested in rurouni kenshin. If you are a fan of the anime you should approve of this item",1479427200,,265,4.018867924528302

7025975,5,B00TYN7IGI,"once you saw this trilogy, you feel all the other actions: the swordfights, etc., are dull.
I love the animation series, now I love this trilogy movie even more, and now it's my topmost favourite.
The directing, oiriginal score, the fight choreograhy, and all the actors....superb!",1478044800,,281,5.130434782608695

7025984,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Packaging was perfect. Brand new. I have not watching any of them yet, but it's exactly what I was expecting.",1469491200,,109,4.5
7025985,5,B00TYN7IGI,"I love foreign films in general and martial arts movies are a serious weakness but when I found out they had made a live action version of my beloved Rurouni Kenshin, I just about lost it. The fight choreography is phenomenal and the cinematography is on point. They did deviate slightly from the manga but that's to be expected when you're trying to condense that many volumes into three movies. Overall, a great choice on slow, bleary days when you just want to curl up under a blanket and watch something fun :)",1468540800,,514,4.537634408602151
7025986,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Oh my gosh, this was so worth the cost! I absolutely loved the movies. Sato Takeru does an amazing job with Kenshin's character. And hearing One OK Rock at the end of every movie was just the perfect cherry on top.",1467936000,,214,4.2439024390243905
7025987,5,B00TYN7IGI,Outstanding and beautiful films. Well worth the buy.,1467676800,,52,5.625
7025988,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Did you like the Cartoon Network Rurouni Kenshin? If so, this is the best imaginable live action version. Really surprisingly good acting and action. Kenshin and Saito are great. We loved this and we were big fans of the cartoon network anime series since our daughter started loving it at 4 years of age.",1466640000,,305,4.666666666666667
7025989,5,B00TYN7IGI,"The package arrived brand new in packaging just as the description says. The picture is superb and the English subtitles make sense. I hear that Funimation did recently pick up this trilogy, so if you want a box set with English written on the back then maybe you might want to wait for those. Otherwise I would say pull the trigger and pick this box set up!",1466553600,2,358,4.358208955223881

7025991,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Excellent 3-pack of matinee Samurai movie, not the retrospective style of Yoji Yamada but considering it is an adaption from a manga series (and a very good adaption of it) it packed some great fight scenes, pseudo historical perspective, a small love interest and great distraction with its humor.",1463356800,,298,5.1020408163265305
7025992,5,B00TYN7IGI,Came complete and on time,1463184000,,25,4.2
7025993,5,B00TYN7IGI,"This was a very high quality adaptation of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin manga. Truncated and changed a little for obvious reasons as the manga is 28  volumes long, it stays delightfully true to the spirit of the original series. High quality action sequences, good chemistry between the cast, and the terrific theme at the core of the series really made this a fantastic trilogy. It's not completely flawless but the flaws are pretty minor. I was really pleased they managed to infuse the movies with some of the humor and happiness found in the comics while still dealing with Kenshin's struggles. If you enjoy Japanese films with subtitles, subtle romance, and a good action film I recommend it!",1463184000,,703,4.9576271186440675
7025994,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Well I'm not a manga fan. I am a sap for a good samurai movie. I cut my teeth on the Toshiro Mifune/Kurosawa, Lone Wolf and Cub and Zatoichi movies.  This trilogy was very entertaining and repeated watching. There is plenty of action and some humor. It is fun to watch throw reality out the window. Hey as in Zatoichi could a blind swordsman take on 25 sighted ronin? The character you enjoy and he stands for justice and good. The theme runs true in westerns.
There are a many live action adaptations from manga; many not so good. This is one that has a good story and characters you enjoy. It's no Seven Samurai or Yojimbo but an entertaining box set. I bought mine from third party much cheaper and arrived intact and timely manner.",1461110400,2,735,4.404411764705882

7025997,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Finally, got my copy of this trilogy. I'm a fan of the anime version but the actualization of the characters of this movie is somehow inaccurate (ex: Sishio Makoto is not a tall person in this movie and wears leather wraps instead of mummy bandage). But, Kenshin, Soujiro, Kaoru, Megumi, Misao, Okina and Seijuro are spot on AMAZING! This bluray disc plays in Region 1: US with subtitles.",1459209600,,388,4.720588235294118

7026003,5,B00TYN7IGI,Got this present for my sister on Christmas! Watched it Christmas morning and played the trilogy the whole day! :D So amazing and a must have for any Ruroni Kenshin fans!! I included pictures of the Reverse Blade sword that my sister also bought at Anime Expo! One is with flash and the other isn't. Anyhow the movies were simply amazing!

7026006,5,B00TYN7IGI,"the choreography of the duet fighting both in katana and street type were the best I have seen on dvd and I have looked at tons of

7026007,5,B00TYN7IGI,"This is one of the best anime shows ever and the live action movies captured every moment of the characters of Rorouni Kenshin, as a fan you have to get this box set. Even though the movies were not quite in sequence of how the storyline was in the anime,the movies bought the anime to life, the first movie captured every sequence of season 1 however the kyoto arc I would say was hard to put it into two movies, and from what they did was awesome in telling the whole story, so I would say to the director what an awesome job you did for us fans of Rorouni Kenshin.",1455321600,,567,4.117117117117117
7026008,4,B00TYN7IGI,I read alot of reviews for this live action Rurouni Kenshin drama. I felt alot was going on to only have 3 movies for this entire series. You really have to try and not have the anime in mind because I think some scenes were out of order and alot of little things were missed that made a big impact to series which was for the director irrelevant to keep. The acting was close to capturing the overall personality of the characters but I thought they could have done better with others you will have to see for yourself. To actually see the series come to live was the best part for why I am bias to giving it 4 stars. I am glad the fight/action scenes were realistic not so cgi-matrix-hidden dragon fake. I feel you will enjoy watching it...it may start slow but it picks up throughout.,1454025600,2,787,4.2885906040268456
7026009,5,B00TYN7IGI,The whole family was hooked on this.,1453766400,,36,4.285714285714286
7026010,5,B00TYN7IGI,"The set is as beautiful as all these reviews have been stating. The already masterful movies are done justice here with high quality picture, sound, menus, and cover art. I didn't agree with all the English subtitle translations, but they get the point across. Definitely worth it!",1453507200,11,281,5.0
7026011,4,B00TYN7IGI,"Last two movies have a different storyline that the original but it still works. The main idea is there, in fact there was the only way to show kenshin's story without too much fantasy or visual effects.
About the product the case is just great, the same runs for each disc.
I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because, as an all time fan, I espected to see the original story in life action. However this is, by far, the best life action for an anime/manga that I ever seen",1452816000,,469,4.164835164835165
7026012,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Absolutely love this live action Kenshin movies. Great display of sword fight, characters displayed great talents. Fighting scenes are great as well as the movie director doesn't have the camera man constantly move the camera around during fight scenes.",1451001600,,253,5.512820512820513
7026013,5,B00TYN7IGI,"First two discs are absolutely amazing. The third, although good movie, was not as amazing.  Third movie was really good but seemed rushed while the other two movies were amazing.",1450656000,,179,4.966666666666667
7026014,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Great live action movie adaptation to the world famous Rurouni Kenshin Manga and Television series. However, this is not a faithful adaptation to either. Yet, it provides it's own story based that captures the essence and struggle of the main character, Kenshin Himura. The actor, Takeru Satoh, is great in the role and does all of his own sword fights and most of the stunts. It is a great watch! If you like the movie, I think you'd love the t.v. series, although a lot more slow, it gives much more depth to the supporting cast. Overall, a huge fan of his story and I can say the production did well to the actual Rurouni Kenshin series.",1447545600,2,640,4.478632478632479
7026015,5,B00TYN7IGI,"This trilogy is phenomenal!! I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who was a fan of the anime series. The casting was close to perfect. They stayed very true to the series, better then I expected they would. Blu-ray worked flawlessly in my blu-ray player. Please do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't regret it!!!",1446249600,,327,4.655172413793103

7026017,5,B00TYN7IGI,one of the first japanese movies ive ever seen that opened the door to an entire new take on japanese hollywood! the action scenes are amazing and the story wonderful. i have seen the anime and it comes fairly close. just a few differences. i understand though you have to cram 94 episodes of anime into a 6 hr movie series. highly recommend to anyone with a love for the art of a samurai.,1444953600,,389,4.27027027027027
7026018,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Too long don't want to read whole review:
These movies have flaws and they won't blow you away but they are very good solid movies that are fun to watch.  Kenshin fans owe it to themselves.

Wow!  A live action film that doesn't suck and is actually great... Let that sink in a moment, ...seriously.  Live action movies based on games and anime is at best ok.  Most just flat out stink and make you regret watching it.  You can't make the transition without some changes, if nothing else to keep the pace of the movie going.  But many make horrible changes that leave many of us fans reeling.  For example I would not give this review to the live action Attack on Titan movie.

But more than this just being a good adaptation, this is a good movie.  If someone I knew never watched the anime or read the manga but liked martial arts movies I would have no problem saying this would be a good watch for them.  I'm not going to go on a limb and say any and all action movie lovers would like this movie but many might like this movie.

All of the actors played their parts well.  For the most part the pacing was good and smooth.  There were some slow parts, like the beginning of the third movie where the characters are recovering from the battle in Kyoto in the second movie.  Martial Art movie lovers will be familar with the formula - hero gets butt kicked, hero makes peace with master and must do his bidding to gain favor, hero trains to fight main villian.  Non-martial arts fan may find this portion of movie abtrusively long, but... BUT, once the action starts in the 3rd movie the pacing is on point treating the viewer to a series of phenomenal fight scenes.  It includes some long uninterupted action sequences that must have had the actors winded if they had to do those takes multiple times.

I thought the live action movies would either tone down Kenshin's acrobatics or go the opposite direction making it look cheesey.  Much to my surprise they did not tone anything down and it did not look lame at all.  They do use wires but most of the fight choregraphy consists of practical action sequences.  The only CGI used was for Makato Shishio's sword.  You tell someone the main villian looks like a mummy and shoots fire from his sword and I'm sure their immediate thought will be, ""OMG this movie is going to be stupid.""  But it works.  It did not look stupid or goofy.  Even Shishio himself, despite his appearance/costume, did not look goofy or cartoony.  You just come to accept this guy whips fire around when he wants.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers look far more unrealistic than the live action Ruroni Kenshin movies do.  This is based on Kenshin so the fight scenes aren't hard hitting and dark like Ong Bak, The Raid series, or the new Daredevil series but they are very smooth and more importantly they fit with the anime so it litterally feels like you are watching a live action version of Ruroni Kenshin.

One of the biggest complaints I've seen is that Emi Takei is too pretty to play Kaoru but despite Kaoru being teased relentlessly in the anime I've always thought she was supposed to be pretty, just goofy and unsure of herself.  I will agree that Megumi should be ""hotter"" but I still think they picked the actors well.  Megumi does look like she would use her looks like a fox and be cunning with it.  Kaoru does look more innocent and they definitely play on that with how Megumi and Kaoru interact in the movies.  If I had to pick on the actors look, I honestly thought they should have picked an actor with a more innocent face for Sojiro but the actor did such a good job that complaint quickly went out the window.  Likewise, at first Cho looked like a bad fit but he too fit very well despite the horrible hairjob he was forced to wear to fit his character.  Takeru Satoh is awesome as Kenshin.  He nails both the innocent goofy wanderer persona Kenshin takes on, as well as the cold eyed assassin persona.  Finding someone who can pull both off couldn't be easy and Takeru Satoh captures Kenshin perfectly.  They even have Kenshin's patented ""Oro"" (huh/what) expression.  Those not familar with the anime/manga will miss the Oro moments because they don't stand out but fans will immediately start laughing.  I couldn't believe they put that in the movies (I didn't read up on them at all) and had to rewind just to make sure that I heard right.

1st MOVIE
Great introduction to Kenshin.  Since Kenshin's name can roughly translate to ""Heart/Spirit of the Sword"" it was nice to see them play up on that at the Kamiya dojo.  Fans of the anime/manga will know of the fight against Takeda Kanry.  Fans will disappointed about the lack of the Oniwaban group.  At first I thought maybe they trimmed the group down to pretty much just Han'nya but instead I think they merged Han'nya with Gein.  I was looking forward to Oniwaban group but I can relunctantly see why they chose not to include them.  I don't think they could have given the group the proper screen time they deserve and keep the pace of the movie on track as the movie is already over 2 hours.  Though despite their exclusion I think fans will be surprised just how close the movie keeps to the source material in general.  Those not familar with the anime/manga should find the movie a good fun watch.  Takeda Kanry will probably seem over the top to someone new to the material but he's supposed to be.  He's an easily excited individual.  Kenshin will battle Takeda Kanry and Jinei in this movie.  The battle with Jinei was done right, it was great.

2nd MOVIE
Kenshin learns of the real threat, Makato Shishio.  Kenshin leaves Kaoru and Tokoyo to do battle in Kyoto and face Shishio.  The first movie was a good fun watch but this movie amps it up and it does a great job sticking to the source material.  Though it is dark and hazy fans will immediately recognize the character in the dark tunnel as the movie opens up.  While watching, I litterally exclaimed outloud, ""TENKEN""!

Even though it is an important plotline, I'm still surprised they stuck so close and included the Eiji storyline as many directors probably would have skipped it.  Clearly they knew how important it was because they gave it the respect it deserves.  It not only adds to the storyline but the overall direction the trilogy was taking in setting up the characters so they did a good job with that scene.  The flashbacks reveal more in this movie than they did in the first movie and it makes you wonder just how much of Kenshin's past they will manage to squeeze in.  Answer is, they didn't get in as much as a fan would like but it is hard to juggle as you sacrifice pacing in your movie.  It really would have been too much information to squeeze in.  Overall I think they provide enough so that viewers with no prior experience with Kenshin will get a good idea of who is he is and the inner demons he has to face.

3rd MOVIE
I would love to say this is straight up action from beginning to end but honestly many people (fans and non-fans) will probably find it boring at first.  It picks up the pieces after the battle in Kyoto by showing the characters recovering from that.  As I stated in the beginning of this review, a martial arts fan will understand the beginning of this movie because it is the same formula most martial art movies take (hero gets beat up, hero must gain respect of his master, hero trains).  Fans of the anime will know of this from Between Life and Death as Kenshin's master, Seijr Hiko, promises to take Kenshin's life if he can't figure out what he is lacking to complete his skill of Hiten Mitsurugi and learn the final move.  Could they have trimmed some of this down?  Sure.  Though viewers will be treated to non-stop action once it starts and fight choregraphy is amazing!  They did an execellent job with all the fights scenes.  The first two movies had great fight scenes but this movie improves on that.  You can't help but like Sano by the end of this movie even if you know no one could take the beating he took.  The Sojiro vs Kenshin fight was a treat and will make you wish they had dragged it a bit longer.  The fight with Shishio is just wow.  The guy is too strong.  Watching all of them attack Shishio was just TOO FUN.

Since I first heard of the first movie I been looking for a copy of the movie on Blu-Ray and had zero luck finding it.  That's 2-3 years of looking.  So as soon as I saw the trilogy was available here on Amazon it was an immediate buy.  The quality is great and the subtitles are easy to follow so if you only speak English as well you will have no problem following the movie, as long as you don't mind reading subtitles (some hate it).  If you're a fan, don't delay.  Who knows how long this will be available on Amazon so grab it while you can.  If you got burned by other releases, like ""The New Kyoto Arc"", trying to fill the void don't be too scared to try this.  This is not that.  There is very few things I think deserve a 1 star review, I would give that New Kyoto arc a 1-star review.

If you're new to Kenshin and like Samurai/Martial Art movies, this is worth a go.  You may even be tempted to want to watch the anime afterwards and then be mad with the rest of us they don't offer it on Blu-Ray.  Actually even trying to find it on DVD you may have to go to a convention.  Shame the owner of the copyright has no interest in a remastered re-release or even just a re-release.  Good thing this movie was so good, it takes some of the salt from the wound away.",1444867200,20,9558,4.387592487194081
7026019,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Great live action interpretation.  In a time of too much shake frame filming to cover up poorly coordinated action scenes, these movies don't go that route.  They choreograph longer scenes and some of the wire work, I've not seen before.

It's region A so you get English subtitles.",1443398400,,282,4.833333333333333

The product is amazing! I have literally bought these individual movies from other sellers multiple times! I was about to give up until I read the reviews...

7026031,5,B00TYN7IGI,"The quality of this package is excellent. I agree with a number of other reviews in regards to the quality of both the video and the audio on the Blu-Ray. The film itself is a fun watch, if not an overly memorable one, which could be enjoyed on its own but is best served as a love-letter to fans of the anime series/OVAs (Rurouni Kenshin & Samurai X). While the musical score underwhelms, in my opinion not always fitting the mood of the scenes and with some tracks overused across the three films, the action scenes are brilliant. Without spoiling anything, the fight scene in the 3rd movie was some of the most fun I've had watching a show in a long time. That's probably an accurate way to summarize the three movies overall - a fun watch, a must-watch for fans of the anime, and a good recommendation for those who just enjoy a samurai flick (or ""jidai-geki"" for those familiar with the term).

Also, a note on the English subtitles - the translation quality is superb. No grammatical errors (aka ""Engrish""); instead, it's a faithful and accurate translation of the Japanese, particularly when it comes to accurately capturing the nature of suffixes and other personal titles.",1438646400,6,1181,4.677884615384615

7026033,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Being a huge fan of the anime, I was thrilled to be able to get this box set. I was worried about the region/playback issues, but everything is perfect. I can imagine it was very difficult to script this and hire actors while remaining true to the source material.
If you go in with a mindset that you are watching an action film and not a remake of your beloved anime, you'll enjoy it quite a bit. This is nowhere near as unsettling and infuriating as Michael Bay's treatment of transformers, which felt like an attack and insult to my childhood memories.  Live action remakes of material we loved when we were younger are tricky, and I can say that this was production was just fine. Granted, my expectations are low given what's been coming out!",1437177600,2,748,4.5
7026034,5,B00TYN7IGI,"Excellent picture and sound quality. The soundtrack is appropriate for a big screen movie.  The cinematography and battle scenes are awesome. Lots of sword fights, beautifully done. The script is very well written, people who did not watch the anime can follow. I watch a lot of Kung Fu movies, I am sure this is exceptionally good. Disks 2 and 3 has trailers but not disk 1. The advertisement at the end of disk 1 looks out of place, disks 2 ad 3 do not have advertisements, instead, they added trailers. The set did not come with special brochures or inserts like some anime DVDs do. The box set is elegantly packaged.

I did not notice grammatical mistakes in the English subtitles. The subtitles are basic but sufficient, accurate and printed in a font that is easy on the eye. I watched each disk in Japanese with English subtitles and then again in Cantonese with English subtitles. I prefer Rurouni Kenshin in Japanese dialogue because Rurouni Kenshin is Japanese. It is interesting watching in Cantonese.

As a Kenshin anime fan, I find The Kyoto Arc (Kyoto inferno & The Legend Ends) makes more sense in the trilogy than in the anime because we understand Shishios background and personality better. The political plot is more sophisticated. Kenshin vs Shishio is emotionally moving. I am surprised they did not flash back on Tomoes death when there were opportunities to do so.

I am thankful the story ends with the Kyoto Arc.",1434153600,29,1437,4.759036144578313

Read the manga",1520985600,,325,4.491525423728813
8703345,4,B00TYN7IGI,"I'm not familiar with anime series but did own the whole manga series back in the days, had read the whole series many times over as a fan, in my twenty's, when Rurouni Kenshin was one of the major forces to be reckoned in manga world.  Recently I found out about this trilogy, saw little clips of fighting scene, felt in love with it (okay, got little nostalgic too) and went ahead and got this trilogy in Blu-ray.  Let me just go over what's good/bad from a once devoted fan's perspective.

Good:
- The best part of it has to be the fighting scene, it wasn't cheesy or did anything manga-like unrealistic stuff but kept it real and did an excellent job of containing the intensity, especially in this HD form.  I thought the fighting scenes alone were worth the price of admission.
- Each character played his/her part fairly faithfully as portrayed in the manga series and overall good acting.  My favorite character was Saito Hajime, hands down, and felt that the movie didn't give him enough exposure or did enough to portray the coolness of Saito Hajime (okay, I'm being little bias here but seriously, the coolest character in the series..).
- They followed the story line fairly faithfully IN THE BEGINNING and some of the different route they took was a welcoming detour in my opinion.

Bad:
- Obviously they couldn't cram everything, the whole series into a 3 part movie so you will notice lot of missing scenes especially toward the end.  Some of the omissions are understandable, trying to keep the movie realistic.  However, I get the impression that they were running out of time or failed with time management and did not dive into some of the semi-major battles (for example, Saito v. Usui and the second part of Kenshin v. Sojiro ) but rather ""wasted"" film time on something that was less relevant.
- Some of the detours they took in story was fine, considering having to cram everything and more importantly didn't deviate from the original story line too much. However, some of the detours were literally a detour from the original story, completely different from the original story, so some devoted fans might not find that too pleasing.
- Just having to watch the last part (the final battle between Shishio vs Kenshin, meaning the movie will not show anything post-Shishio) I just didn't like the power-balance they portrayed in the movie.  There always had been a debate about who was the strongest, especially between Shishio and Kenshin.  However, the way they decided to play out the plot at the end, especially the final battle, they kinda butchered that fine balance of who is the strongest.
- Some parts, or the things they show you briefly in the movie can only be understood by the fans - such as showing Kenshin stepping another step for his ultimate technique - and they kinda did a poor job of showing/explaining what it is because I thought they were worth something and important enough to be at least explained briefly or included in the movie plot.

Conclusion:
Am I disappointed with some aspects of the movie as once a devoted fan?  Yes.  Do I regret getting it though?  I would have to say no because the production value was higher than my expectation and did not have that B-rated movie feel.  I think I will be keep watching it again later or at least let it run in the background for old time's sake.",1515974400,,3346,4.647457627118644
