8711331,5,B00VUK50PY,"This is the story of U-166, Operation Drumbeat, and LCDR H.G. Claudius skipper of PC 566 in the Gulf of Mexico.

U-166 was the only U-boat to be sunk by an American ship in U.S. waters. Through digital mapping and a fortunate friendship between the U.S. Navy's CNO and a former Naval Commander, a revision of findings of fact was made in the case of LCDR Claudius' claim of sinking 166 through two depth charge sortees.

It is interesting to note that 166 was on her maiden voyage from the Western coast of France.",1466380800,2,514,4.457446808510638

8711334,5,B00VUK50PY,"Can't wait to get this DVD.  Saw the show on TV yesterday.  Bought this so my husband can see it.  It is an amazing story and very well done.  You will not believe it.  Best part - it is true history! I can't really say much more without giving away spoilers.  First time I have every been willing to spend this much money on a one hour DVD, but will be well worth it. Production is great too - no annoying music or over-dramatic narration.",1432080000,7,440,4.117647058823529
8711335,5,B00VUK50PY,"Britain as an island nation during WW2 was vulnerable since its survival depended on supply imported from abroad; raw materials, food, weapons, roughly one million tons of cargo a year, crossing the Atlantic and Nazis were close to cutting off that flow. The key to Nazis success was Unterseeboot-German for underwater-boat - - known to the rest of the world as the U-boat, which had one purpose only: attack. Out of 1,200 U-boats, Nazis lost 743 in WW2, only 10 in American waters and U-166 was the only U-boat which sank in Gulf of Mexico, some 150 miles of American shores in 1942. In 2001, marine archaeologists made a surprising discovery of the bow section of U-166 during preparations for undersea pipeline. In 2014, 72 years after the battle, US awarded Commander Herbert Claudius only son with The Legion of Merit when infact 72 years prior to that, NAVY disgraced and gave Commander Herbert Claudius F. I noticed the following when watching this documentary;
1. Those Nazis are sure creative geniuses when it comes to design, engineering and manufacturing.
2. With all the technology in hand, why can not we find Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 missing plane which has been lost in the southern Indian Ocean.
3. As a proud American, I thank Mr. Robert Ballard for his work and dedication for giving it all in the name of justice,
4. As a proud American, I am speechless for what US has done to Commander Herbert Claudius. What Commander Herbert Claudius did was save many American lives and probably changed history by sinking U-166. Considering the treatment that he received from NAVY, there is not a single monument in his honor. Shame, shame, shame.",1430956800,6,1662,4.855633802816901
