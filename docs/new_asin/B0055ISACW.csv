4578574,1,B0055ISACW,Did not care for this very dark production. I've seen and preferred other versions of this wonderful opera.,1418601600,,107,5.0
4578575,5,B0055ISACW,"Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmlites seems to be a work almost made for Olivier Py. Based on a drama by Georges Bernanos relating the martyrdom of 16 nuns executed during the French revolution, Poulenc's 20th century masterpiece would however seem to fit more closely with Py's very public Catholic profile in France as well as something of a controversial figure or revolutionary in the theatre and opera world. It's these characteristics that provide much of the conflict of opposing ideals that lie at the heart of this particular work. Common to both however is the idea of 'Libert' The word is scrawled on a wall by one of the revolutionaries (one of the servants of the De la Force house) who are becoming more present on the streets, and it is transformed into 'Libert en Dieu' (Freedom in God) by the time of Poulenc's incredible musical 'Salve Regina' setting of the execution of the nuns.

There is some distance that has to be covered between those two points, but Py's direction and the superb casting for the production cover those well.  The director's setting of the death of the Mother Superior is particularly powerful, Madame de Croissy pinned vertically high on the wall in her bed, beyond the reach of Blanche and the nuns in attendance on her, the harsh lighting from below the stage casting long terrifying shadows mark her bitterness at the nature of her agonised blaspheming death. Elsewhere, using little tableaux scenes, Py makes his mark in his consideration of how the Ideals of the Revolution relate to and conflict with religious belief - freedom from fear, freedom of expression, freedom to practise one's faith, freedom from the tyranny of death in the promise of an afterlife.

Where one stands on such questions no doubt determines the staging of the all-important finale, as can be seen from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikolaus-Lehnhoff/dp/B003E113HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikolaus Lehnhoff</a>'s starkly final extinguishing of the light in Hamburg marked by each fall of the guillotine, or indeed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dmitri-Tcherniakov/dp/B004QDNSHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dmitri Tcherniakov</a>'s complete subversion of the message in the hugely controversial Paris production where all the nuns incredibly remain alive at the conclusion. Olivier Py's creation of the final scene for the Thtre des Champs-Elyses is as plain and simply dressed as it the production is elsewhere, with no additional dramatic effects. At the fall of the guillotine, each Carmelite nun, dressed in a plain white robe, simply drops her head and walks towards the light of the stars at the back of the stage. This more clearly responds to the religious message of the work, and - as one of the greatest coups de thtre in all of opera - Py's staging of it is unquestionably just as effective as the scene ought to be.

Poulenc's score for the opera is also filled with the same kind of religious fervour and conductor Jrmie Rhorer consequently takes the orchestra through a robust musical performance of the work. In contrast to Kent Nagano's interpretation, there's less of the shimmering Debussy here and more of the muscular Mussorgsky that forms part of the work's musical influences. There's almost a strident romanticism about the performance here, one that also hints at film-music type composition with dramatic underscoring, but Poulenc's score isn't so easy to pin down and Rhorer also manages to bring out moments of beauty in its expressionistic touches.

More than anything however, the score to Dialogues des Carmlites is attuned to the voices, to the dialogues, to conveying the words and their underlying sentiments with maximum expression. The outstanding cast assembled here are certainly capable of achieving that. It's not so much the variety of voices - although they combine and interrelate wonderfully across the whole female range - but it's particularly fine when it's sung by such a distinguished cast of distinctive singers like Patricia Petibon (Blanche), Sophie Koch (Mre Marie), Vronique Gens (Madame Lidoine), Sandrine Piau (Sister Constance) and Rosalind Plowright (Madame de Croissy). It's a rare treat to have such singers all together in one production and they each bring considerable personality to the work. The male singers also have an important role to play and those are capably performed by Topi Lehtipuu (Chevalier de La Force), Philippe Rouillon (the Marquis) and Franois Piolino (the Convent Priest).",1415059200,21,4571,5.41432584269663
4578576,2,B0055ISACW,"This warning applies to the DVD of Bayerisches Staatsoper production directed by Nagano and staged by Tcherniakov.

This modernized production of Poulenc's masterpiece flows reasonably well except for the final scene. As was mentioned by several reviewers, the opera is so great that almost any competent production is enjoyable, and this one is no exception, that is until the final scene. Unfortunately, the final scene is so important that destroying it ruins the whole.
Out of some urge for a happier end, they decided to alter the meaning so that instead of dying on the guillotine after her sisters, Blanche - and I quote from the booklet - ""..dares to try to prevent the catastrophe which is imminent. At the cost of her life she saves the Carmelite nuns."" Apparently, she drags them one after another out of a shack filled with some poisonous gas. This is very humane but it does not work with Poulenc's music which is too clearly punctuated by guillotine knife drops. You can modernize and go against stage directions to a degree but not to the point where the action becomes contradictory with the music. If you want a scene where a heroic woman saves lives in a heroic manner, that could be a great scene but it just would require different music. This is not what Poulenc's music is about.",1391558400,15,1301,4.756637168141593
4578577,4,B0055ISACW,"This has always been a favorite opera since seeing it many years ago.  This is a very competent production.  The music, a very very important part of any opera, is well delivered.  The casting and production is ok.  I will always like the Met's production especially the finale but this is quite acceptable.  Based on a true story, the music facilitates a very spiritual experience that transcends any one performance.",1387238400,2,418,4.914285714285715
4578578,5,B0055ISACW,"Well done. This opera will leave you a little shaken. The theme is brilliantly portrayed. The music and the singing is quite good and the staging is adequate.

The acting sometimes misses the mark as it is hard to discern the emotion being portrayed. Crazy? Scared? Insecure?

This production deserves your attention if you're ready to go beyond Figaro and Aida and have tasted Wagner, then try this modern piece. I'm very glad I bought it.

For clarification: This refers to the Muti conducted La Scala version as pictured here.",1380844800,6,529,4.855555555555555
4578579,1,B0055ISACW,"A rare glimpse of Jeanne Moreau in what might have been extraordinary.  It awaits blu-ray, subtitles worthy of the of the magnificent novel.",1373328000,2,140,5.086956521739131
4578580,4,B0055ISACW,"Am I wrong, or have the Amazonians hashed up the reviews here? Supposedly they have to do with the Muti-La Scala DVD of the Dialogues, but in fact they seem to be talking about the Opera du Rhin (Strasbourg) version. The latter seems to get 4-5 stars and perhaps La Scala does, though it's hard to to tell.
So while I would probably agree about the performances of this wonderful piece, I would give Amazon one star for messing up. (It's a little bit like a recent experience I had with Spotify, when clicking on what was allegedly a new recording of Beethoven's Kreutzer sonata brought up instead the last act of Don Giovanni).",1370044800,4,628,4.517543859649122
4578581,4,B0055ISACW,"Clever modern concept stagings of opera are all very well in the right place and with the right kind of opera.  Sometimes however, it just seems perverse to take them out of their original context, particularly when the opera applies to a specific historical period or event that is explicitly referred to in the libretto.  There seems little value then in ""updating"" Poulenc's 1956 opera Dialogues des Carmlites away from its French Revolutionary setting or the historical incident in 1794 where sixteen nuns from a Carmelite convent in Compigne were executed for resisting the confiscation of the Church's assets and the dissolution of the order.  You just know however that a controversial director like Dmitri Tcherniakov is never going to go down a conventional route.

What he achieves in this production of Dialogue des Carmlites recorded at the Bayerisches Staatsoper in Munich (modern-dress with no nuns in habits) is debatable but interesting.  Poulenc based the opera on a play by Georges Bernanos, which in turn was based on an original 1931 novel by Gertrud von le Fort ('Die Letzte am Schafott'), which itself used the subject as a means of commenting on German social disorder following the fall of the Weimar Republic - so it's certainly artistically valid for Tcherniakov to update the work if it's in the service of throwing a new light on the themes.  What is rather more controversial is that the director radically changes the original and really quite powerful conclusion of the opera.  Tchernaikov's finale, which practically turns the original on its head, is just as powerful and dramatic in its own right, but whether it ""improves"" or casts any further light on the actions of Blanche de la Force is debatable.  It could just be that it's the complete disregard of the traditional approach that is what is really shocking about the ending here, and it results in an equal amount of audible booing and cheers at the director's curtain call.

At the very least however, Tcherniakov's staging forces the audience to think about the subject again in a different way, and it's an opera that really does have a lot of deeper subtexts to be drawn out of it.  What makes this production even more worthwhile in this respect is the conducting of Kent Nagano.  The music in Dialogues des Carmlites can be a little strange and unsettling, even with some hauntingly beautiful melodies that evoke Debussy's Pellas et Mlissande, but Nagano seems to bring out those ambiguous qualities of the opera and its similarities to Debussy even more strongly, with a greater sense of warmth and harmony than, for example the Simone Young/Nikolaus Lehnhoff Hamburg production (also on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B003E113HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>).  That harmony and warmth is also more evident in the singing - although not in every case - so I wouldn't necessarily say that one is better than the other, but I certainly find the interpretation here much more intriguing, creating new resonances and opening up the opera in an unexpected way.

Whether the staging works or not in a live context, it certainly doesn't come across well on DVD or Blu-ray.  The majority of the opera takes place (as you can see from the cover) within a boxed room on the stage.  This means that crossbeams frequently get in the way, obscuring the view of the singers, which is further hampered by a gauze screen that softens the image, desaturates the colours and causes hazy netting effects.  The HD reproduction of this consequently isn't good, and the encoding doesn't really help matters, looking rather blurry in movements.  Between the net effect and the encoding, this does appear to be a visually substandard release.  (Although the cover states it's a BD25 disc it is however, as you would expect, BD50 - ie. dual-layer). The audio tracks are better, the singing mostly clear, the orchestration warm and enveloping, but also revealing a good amount of colour and detail.  It's no match for the precise crystalline clarity of the DTS HD-MA 7.1 mix on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-Hamburg-Staatsoper/dp/B003E113HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008 Hamburg Staatsoper</a>&nbsp;production, and if you would prefer a more faithful version of the opera I would highly recommend that release on Blu-ray or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Muti-Carsen-production/dp/B000TJBNOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Muti/Carsen production</a>&nbsp;on DVD, but there are enough intriguing elements in the Nagano/Tcherniakov staging to make this certainly at least worth renting out of interest.",1307923200,9,4737,5.508965517241379
8458408,5,B0055ISACW,"This is a superbly sung performance of Poulenc's gorgeous score in a minimalist setting.  There is not a single weak link in the cast, and it is highly effective.  The only disappointment is the handling of the final guillotine scene; to anyone not knowing the story, it would be sort of a mystery as to what's going on.  Great, great singing of fabulous music.",1522540800,2,361,4.609375
8458409,4,B0055ISACW,"Most everyone here hasn't reviewed the correct production, which in this case is the Tcherniakov/Bayerische Staatsoper. In any case:

Good aspects:
- The Tcherniakov aesthetic (which shares a fair amount in common with his Onegin and Macbeth) works quite well with this piece. The four-wall approach with scrim over the windows makes it feel as if you're looking in on the secret lives of these nuns.
- Really good vocal performances by Gritton as Blanche, Guilmette as Constance, and Resmark as Marie. While Gritton has a shakier time in the role compared to others, she brings a tortured quality to the role that works well.
- Great use of lighting that brings a clear idea of inside and outside, along with general doom.

Not as good aspects:
- Trademark director manipulation. If you see a Tcherniakov production, you know he's going to fiddle with something. In this case, his decisions and the rationale behind them are not always evident or agreeable.
- The tenors in this production (Blanche's brother, the priest) are comparatively week compared to the women in the cast.
- There are really awkward cuts to black, that distort a sense of flow from scene to scene. Also a typical director feature.",1519171200,,1205,4.901960784313726

8458412,5,B0055ISACW,"I came here from Poulenc's operatic version. For those of you who are familiar with the opera will truly appreciate this version. Since this is an import from France, it is all french, with no subtitles whatsoever. However, it follows the opera almost verbatim. It is the TV film from 1984 with the formidable Nicole Courcel as Mother Marie of the Incarnation, and Madeline Robinson as Madame Lidoine.

Sporting a musical score of one song used throughout, it is effective in it's simplicity. The soundtrack is utilized at it's most emotionally charged places. The song itself is a simple chord of organ, and a choir of sopranos.

The film is wonderfully shot. Everything about it looks fantastic, from the white walls of the Cathedral, to the dingy streets of Paris, during the French Revolution. It utilizes an effective guillotine as well. The costumes are wonderful as well.

Perhaps the most fetching of this film is the actresses who played the Compiegne Nuns. All of these ladies, even if they had no lines, were marvelous. Also, the most harrowing scene is of course, what the action leads up to. The martyring to the 16 Nuns by the Guillotine. The scene passes in rapid succession compared to Poulenc's harrowing finale. The finale has no music to it, other than the sisters singing ""Veni Creator Spiritus"" until there is none left. This ending is visceral, and cathartic. We don't witness the heads being lobbed off, but we do witness something close to it, and should really be left to the viewer to experience.

Despite it's major flaw of having no subtitles, and an even bigger flaw of no english release. The film is all around, very cathartic. Some viewers may find it's stretches of dialogue exhausting, especially without the subtitles. I suggest you brush up on the story before watching it.",1463875200,3,1809,4.863636363636363
8458413,5,B0055ISACW,"This is an extraordinary recording on more than one level; first it is a French opera cast almost entirely with Francophone singers. The two singers who are not French, Plowright and Lentipuu. English and Finnish respectively are more than respectful as regards the text. Plowright has the harder task since she has the death scene of Mere Marie. She is superb, only trumped by Nadine Denize. I am well aware that Poulenc wanted the opera sung in the language of the country it was being performed. It premiered at Scala and  I understand that there is a recording but it is not easily available. It boasted a list of major Italian artists much like the first authorized EMI recording. A pity they did not go into the studio and record it.

If for no other reason i would recomment this taping for the presence of Gens and Petibon. The former is woefully underrecoded and a major artist of distinction. She has two Donna Elviras. one a dreadful production  from Beixto (spelliing?) which is essentially the Prague version and thus omits the Mi tradi and the most recent entry,from the Royal Opera. She is sup
I have heard all the DVD's of the Dialogue with the exception of the English language version from Australia. Alas any performance with Dame Joan is one that I would avoid. Personal antipathy, plus hearinig all the radio broadcasts from the Met. which were in  English. The Muti and the performance taped in Germany are all good although Anja Silja creates a sound world that is miles away from the musical notation. The productfrom Strasbourg is mostly French and is beautifully sung. I am glad to have both versions.

I am neither Catholic nor a believer but I love this opera and am thrilled that for the most part there is never a sense of routine, of simply going through the paces. I would love to see the Dexter (Met) version made available, sung in French--I would buy it in a heart beat.",1451606400,5,1905,4.640949554896142

Poulenc, a devote Roman Catholic, tells the story through that of a shy and perhaps troubled young woman, the daughter of one of the privileged class, who joins the convent and struggles, as do they all, with their faith, and oaths, in the face of fear and death. It is a composition that grows in intensity to a shattering conclusion.",1423353600,9,465,4.5476190476190474
