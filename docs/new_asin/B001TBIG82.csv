8340969,4,B001TBIG82,"Another good dvd from this long-running german outfit now comprised of american and british members exception made of the founder.

Only drawbackks are that it's out of production and people are asking silly prices for it when it's out there to grab for free if you know what I mean, and the live set is only 8 songs, 35' long but it kicks butt bigtime; it's heavier than previous offerings, the sound of the band has definitely veered into a full-fledged industrial metal style, no bass guitar anymore, double kickdrums, dual guitar attack and dual vocals courtesy of Sacha and that eye-candy that is Lucia Cifarelli.

The filming is top notch in spite of consisting of few camera angles and a tad-too-dark stage but the delivery is most impressive and the sound a steamroller, with a constant low end thump triggered from the keyboards guaranted to make everything that is not glued on walk across your listening room; man did I feel it on my bones ! (massive subwoofer required :-)  ). The aggro is delightful.

As a guise of bonus you got the same audio mix over fan camera edited to fit the actual performance, which I didn't care much for, interspersed with moronic comentary on the part of audience members and guys who shot part of the amateur material. Insights from members of the band would have been much preferrable as was the case on previpus dvds, not to mention a full set of course, but hey, you can't always have the cake AND eat it. Even if your a casual fan like I am, you'll love this. It's nothing like Ministry (which I love BTW); these guys have a style of their very own.",1314835200,,1596,4.550522648083624
