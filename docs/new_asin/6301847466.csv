7816290,4,6301847466,"Rising Son is the story of a son seeking indepedence from the dreams his father has for him against the backdrop of the severe recession of the 1980s. Brian Dennehy is in his element as a middle manager in an automotive factory who worked his way up from the factory floor but must face the lost of his career as the plant closes. He dreams of his sons having better lives and pushes them both to have the career he wants for them, whether they do or not. Matt Damon plays Charlie, the son, in one of his earliest roles and does a fine job. Piper Laurie plays the wife and mother trying to keep peace in her house and her family together. A genuinely fine film.",1345248000,,661,4.21259842519685
