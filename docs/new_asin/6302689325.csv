7831030,5,6302689325,"The 1993 documentary ""Cliffhangers"" provides an excellent overview of the classic Republic serials from the 1930s and '40s. Film historian Leonard Maltin utilizes the vast Republic library to his advantage - showcasing Saturday matinee treasures such as ""Daredevils of the Red Circle,"" ""Zorro's Fighting Legion,"" ""Adventures of Captain Marvel"" and ""Spy Smasher."" Along with Maltin's engaging narration, the recollections of Clayton Moore, Linda Sterling and director William Witney are a nice touch. ""Cliffhangers"" is terrific fun and an affectionate tribute to those thrills of yesteryear.",1126310400,6,590,5.952941176470588
