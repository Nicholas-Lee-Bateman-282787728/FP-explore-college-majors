7085512,5,B00VAX98Z4,"Fun adventure/action film. Grabs your attention and never lets it slip.
All characters (Akshay, Kay kay, Anupam kher,Danny and many other interesting characters whose names I don't know) are sufficiently deep and yet well defined. You will enjoy it, especially if you liked Akshay's 'Special 26'.",1439510400,,296,5.456521739130435

7085514,2,B00VAX98Z4,"Very well done movie but it has no climax. It was more like a documentary. Personally, I prefer watching 24 if I want terrorism plot. Indian movies prolong the scenes too much. For eg. They will show a man walking from one side to another talking literally 1-2 min of a movie.",1437609600,,276,4.326923076923077
7085515,5,B00VAX98Z4,"Love anything with Akshay ... but nice to see a serious movie that addresses global terrorism.  We forget how many nations are impacted by terrorism.  The nature of interrogation is different in every country too - but I'm guessing a ""little"" theatrical drama was provided.  Well done!",1436745600,,285,5.0212765957446805

7085555,4,B00VAX98Z4,"Baby is about heroes and heroism and seems to have been ripped from the headlines. Baby, directed by Neeraj Pandey is an espionage thriller that could just have a whiff of reality in it. This is a film about terrorism  that suspends your imagination for three hours in a very enjoyable way.
Akshay Kumar, leaves aside his buffoonery and with a  mustache is the lead in a film about an anti terrorism unit that hunts bad guys discreetly, i.e without the knowledge of the government and people. On paper they don't exist. If they are caught, they are on their own and even the government of India will disown them.
Akshay Kumar is one of the super secret spies that is hunting down terrorists globally as we get to travel with them all over the world but these are not ordinary jaunts as bedlam and chaos follow everywhere the Baby - the unit as it called goes.
The film begins with a terrorist plot that has been stopped but before the terrorist is brought to justice he commits suicide and warns that there are many attacks on the way.
There are very few twists but all of them are amazing executed and hold your attention for the entire film. Neeraj Panday is an amazing director and has managed to make another memorable film after A Wednesday. The action scenes are well choreographed. Acting is top notch because we have Kay Kay Menon, Anupam Kher, Danny Denzongpa and Sushant Singh in the cast.
A film that takes a lot of liberties but yet manages to score because it has been so well made. I think this would easily be one of the best films of 2015. Released on 23rd January 2015.",1451692800,,1586,4.4655172413793105

8709764,1,B00VAX98Z4,"The video contains a lots of intermittent stops that totally ruined the movie experience. We had friends over our house and rented this movie, but the stops (or pauses) in the video made it a very awful show, especially when the movie is a thriller. Amazon - please look into this matter, already the rental price is quite high and we did not enjoy a single bit of it. A reimbursement would be appreciated.",1494720000,,406,4.5

8709767,5,B00VAX98Z4,"Sometimes you get silly Akshay, sometimes you get intense Akshay. I think BABY is a riduculous title for this movie, given its context, but whatevs. BABY presents us with an intense Akshay Kumar, the one we saw in KHAKEE back in the day and in, for the most part, the more recent HOLIDAY (which did have its moments of silly). The premise ain't new under the sun. To combat the alarming upsurge of international terrorism, those in the intelligence community within the Indian government have recruited twelve people from the police and the military for an experimental black ops task force. Their official records expunged, these twelve were deployed to root out and terminate acts of terrorism on domestic AND foreign soil. It's a risky program proposed as a five-year trial run with the caveat that, if the field agents were ever caught out, the government would readily disavow them. For some unfathomable reason, this program came to be known as ""Baby."" I still don't get it.

Four years in, one year left, the Baby strike team embarks on its final mission. Baby's had a good run. Thirteen of the most wanted terrorists taken down. Twenty-four blasts or attacks on the home front prevented. Eight harrowing ""encounters"" survived. There's been a somber toll. Of the original twelve operators, four are left. And yet the biggest prize still looms at large: the dreaded head instigator Maulana Rehman whose influence is so insidious even the United States has put a $10 million bounty on him. This movie tracks the exploits of top operative Ajay Singh Rajput (Akshay Kumar) as he and his globetrotting team pursue Rehman's death-dealing minions from Istanbul to India to Nepal and to the Gulf reaches.

It's been a minute since I'd seen a Bollywood movie. BABY is a welcome reminder of how much I relish this film industry. Except BABY isn't emblematic of prototypical Bollywood. Absent is the ballyhoo concerning mawkish sentiment. There is no weepy, extravagant romance, and no excited families, no balmy humor, and barely a musical number. Oh, there's a brief musical interlude to emphasize our man Ajay's domestic life and then the sleek music video over the closing credits. And then there's the score. The score is dope and does good work in heightening the tension.

BABY is a no-nonsense thriller, smartly packaged and executed with precision and nerve-jangling flair by Neeraj Pandey. BABY is Pandey's third outing as director, after the excellent A WEDNESDAY and SPECIAL 26. Gotta keep an eye on him.

He draws out very good performances from his cast, from Danny Denzongpa as the steadfast chief of the task force, to Anupam Kher as Mr. Shukla, the amusing tech support who dreads working with Ajay because he always lands him in tight spots (Anupam's hair, though), to Mikaal Zulfikar who has a bit part as Ajay's cool-as-the-other-side-of-the-pillow contact in the Saudi, to demure female operative Tapsee Pannu whose badassery is showcased in one gritty fight scene, to Rasheed Naz who exercises a venomous turn as the chief terrorist Rehman. But none of these solid performances would've meant diddly if Akshay Kumar hadn't brought it. He anchors the whole thing. Akshay is super-intense and restrained and believable in demonstrating over and again that Ajay's mettle is composed of steel core. Would the film have had better flow if absent of Ajay's scenes with his wife? Maybe. But then you would've chanced Ajay's being thought of as this soulless killing machine. Madhurima Tuli as his long-suffering wife doesn't get much shine. She suspects that Ajay's job is a shady and dangerous one. There's a running gag involving her calling Ajay except he's always ""in conference."" I don't mind these scenes. She humanizes our guy.

Gratifyingly, Pandey tones down the jingoism. He presents terrorism as something that exists in the world and must be resisted with utmost effort. Mostly, he stays away from the religious aspects of terrorism, although, okay, there is that one chilling scene in which Rehman gets on the mic to exhort his adoring masses. Afterwards, the demonic eyeball effects are a bit much.

From jump the movie stressed me out. The opening sequence had me on edge. How Ajay acquires key intel from a captured rogue agent about an imminent bombing is straight-up savage and (probably) borrows from the CIA playbook when it comes to being underhanded and just plain mean. It also immediately gives us a window into Ajay's character. The action scenes... they're solid. I don't get much impressed with fight scenes anymore, not after THE RAID movies. But Akshay, with his background in martial arts, is convincing in his combat sequences, as is Tapsee Pannu in her one scene. Here and there, it was obvious that a punch didn't really connect, so that could've been better done. I'm also not too keen on Ajay's shadowing skills. Dude was literally only a few feet away from the person he was tracking, and I bet the baseball cap and shades make one stand out more than blend in when one's obviously skulking like that. My last quibble has to do with the sub-titles. I giggled every time they tried to sugarcoat an expletive. The S word was sub-titled once as ""Oh no!"" and later as ""Shucks!"" Those are really minor snags. BABY, lamely titled, is a terrific watch replete with lucid storytelling, crackling action, nail-biting suspense, and a committed roster of actors. I'm stoked that there's a sequel in the offing. Or, actually, a prequel out in March 2017 titled NAAM SHABANA that focuses on Tapsee Pannu's character. Can't wait.",1487376000,,5562,4.96244635193133
