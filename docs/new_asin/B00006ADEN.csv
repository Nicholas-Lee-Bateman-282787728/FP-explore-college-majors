Not all that worth it unless you want to only get through to the scrolls part. You'd still be better off buying all three volumes to fully enjoy the show.",1497657600,,258,4.18

7966102,4,B00006ADEN,"My daughter wanted this to complete her collection, she is a Mummy fan.  We didn't realize that it was a small disc, was that listed on the ad?",1357603200,,143,4.107142857142857
7966103,3,B00006ADEN,I enjoyed it but not as much as the movies.  When you watch you expect it to follow the movies. Same characters but I was annoyed with the changes.  I thought it would be more of a continuation or other adventures that happened in between the three movies. If they made it into a series then they might be able to fix this. It was fun though.,1351296000,2,342,4.08955223880597

7966106,5,B00006ADEN,"Not having seen any of this cartoon series based on Universal's feature film, ""The Mummy,"" I was surprised at how much fun this was to watch. With all the characters from the film transformed to animation, the basic sense of fun and adventure remain.

The cartoon, however, centers around their young son, Alex, who unknowingly becomes the target of ""you know who"" when his mom and dad unearth an ancient bracelet holding secrets. It will take Alex and his parents from Cairo to Paris, across the sands on camel and through the sky in a dirigible.

That same sense of fun and adventure that was so prevelant in the film runs throughout this enjoyable animated feature. There is just the right mix of danger and wise-cracking to make for a good time.

Those who enjoy the occasional cartoon feature will like this one a lot. And kids will certainly gobble it up. An enjoyable time-killer that won't bore parents looking for something to watch with their children. Good stuff.",1161561600,7,974,4.7514792899408285
