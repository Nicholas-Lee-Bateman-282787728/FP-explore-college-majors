137700,3,0792158318,"What timing! I just watched this Indiana Jones adventure on cable this afternoon. This is a good story, and a nice introduction to the Australian Light Horse and their attack on Beersheba during WWI. It also features a  cameo appearance by T.E. Lawrence (the legendary Lawrence of Arabia). Plus,  this episode co-stars the alluring Catherine Zeta-Jones. But if you want to  see a great portrayal of the Battle of Beersheba, skip this video and pick  up ""The Lighthorsemen"" instead. How good is this little-known  Australian film? Good enough that its director, Simon Wincer, later made  this Young Indiana Jones adventure - and lifted some great battle scenes  from his earlier film!",938908800,,683,5.099099099099099

7792000,5,0792158318,"A great yarn with a little bit of poetic licence. Although based on a true theatre of operation in the Middle East, Indy gets involved with the Aussie ""Diggers"" of the Australian Light Horse. He befriends them and become great mates. A ripping yarn with great excitement and well put together. The action could have been a little more intense as it was in the Australian Movie ""The Lighthorsemen"". Albeit, I enjoyed it and found it pretty accurate for its historical content. The only thing thing it doesn't show is how the British stuffed up, like they did everywhere else during WW1.",1069977600,3,585,4.745098039215686
7792001,1,0792158318,"Although this movie has no rating, (and why is that?) I would say it is the equivalent of a PG-13.  The film contains quite a bit of violence and violent themes.  War scenes.  Guns firing.  Man falling off cliff including hitting the ground.  And the scene that made me turn it off showed a close up of Young Indiana stabbing a man including close-up of knife going in and out of his stomach.  Parents beware.  ""Not rated"" does NOT mean it didn't deserve one!",1058745600,,459,4.392857142857143
7792002,1,0792158318,they are insulting other nations in this film. As a turkish youth I felt myself very bad. This is a political film it only aims to insult other nations.. Americans and British people are hero in this film of course.. According to them other nations are natural disasters.. Too bad for human beings..,1041552000,,299,4.660377358490566
7792003,5,0792158318,"One of my favorite of the Young Indy videos.  Flanery does a wonderful job making us believe this is Indiana Jones, and the supporting cast is especially fine.  Also, it has terrific, unforced, references to other  Young Indy adventures, giving you a better feel for Indy's growing  maturity, without making you feel you're missing crucial  information.
There's a good deal of humor throughout and the end manages  a real tension and sense of danger.
Why doesn't Paramount convince Lucas  to let them make more?",954892800,2,511,5.011904761904762
7792004,5,0792158318,"This is not my favorite in this series, but it is good. I like the emotion and drama added to the build-up and actual charge of the Australians. I also like the fact that Indy is not completely taken in by the treacherous  Catherine-Zeta Jones character.  When she is shooting at him at the end, he  actually gets up the nerve to shoot her back! :)  Anyway, this is a good  episode with a good plot.",948758400,,399,4.197368421052632
7792005,5,0792158318,"This fine epic episode of Young Indy shows how George Lucas could make such a spectacle on a TV Budget...he obtained much of the action, horse riding, and the massive attack on Beersheba from another film!  There is an  excellent Austailian film from 1990-91 called THE LIGHTHORSEMEN. I can't  remember the Director or Cast, but chunks of footage from this film have  been ""borrowed"" by Lucas' team to flesh-out this Indy Adventure.  I am sure that George L., with his connections in the film world could  obtain the rights to the footage from THE LIGHTHORSEMEN...Actually, the  whole plot of the Aussies talents being neglected by the British, the  excursion to leave the false maps, the calvary-trek with no water, and the  Aussie's once in Beersheba tracking down the wires to the switchboard to  stop the destruction of the Wells...all in the Austrailian Film. I've  looked for a ""thank You"" note at the end of this Indy's credits,  but have yet to spot it.",947462400,4,961,4.828220858895706
7792006,5,0792158318,"WHO CARES WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS EPISODE, CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IS A MADD FINE BABE!",944611200,4,82,4.928571428571429
7792007,4,0792158318,"While the adventure elements were quite well handled, the scenes of Indy doing a bad Arabian accent left a bad taste in my mouth. Him leaving his  female partner in the lurch didn't exactly sit well with me either. I found  the plot to be a bit confusing, but on the whole the action was quite good  and the scenery was worthy of Lawerence of Arabia. I found the added extra  bonus interviews with both Lucas and Flanery to be quite informative. But  where was George Hall?!?",941328000,,475,4.413793103448276
