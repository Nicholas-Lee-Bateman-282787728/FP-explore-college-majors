8697603,4,B00S89IRVE,"Cool story about forty United States citizens who are detained against their will and with the very real threat of death and harm . Individuals , married couples and at least one child . Kept in an otherwise deserted and large hotel in Shanghai . Chinese Police chief Colonel Zorek (Marvin Miller with his magnificent baritone voice) is certain that one of the detained in a spy . Apart from the group and able to seemingly come and go as she pleases is a lovely female named Rita King (Ruth Roman) . Already comfortably ensconced in the hotel prior to the detainees arrival , her movements are perplexing .
The terrific cast also includes ; Phillip Ahn (in a solid supporting role) , Whit Bissell (likewise) , Edmond O'Brian (always great as the lead protagonist) and a young Richard Jaeckel (handsome and ready for action) to single out but a few .",1508544000,,850,4.598684210526316
