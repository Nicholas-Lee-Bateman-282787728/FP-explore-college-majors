8402488,5,B003QRMV38,"Disturbing. Viewed in light of past and ongoing agency debacles it is in retrospect prophetic. Many that epically failed on 9Eleven not only escaped punishment but were placed in positions in the DHS/ TSA. Government modus operandi writ large; Failure followed by expansion of power,",1425254400,,283,5.311111111111111
8402489,5,B003QRMV38,This was a good documentary on the beginning of TSA. It really shows how crazy this agency really is. How this agency is a waste of tax dollars and how the TSA has over stepped their bounds.,1391644800,,190,4.162162162162162
8402490,5,B003QRMV38,"An exceedingly well-done documentary of bureaucratic incompetence and criminality told by people in the front lines of national ""security"" efforts.

First released in 2010, this DVD is a timely must-see, given recent and ongoing revelations of NSA and other government activities, however well-intentioned.

Alas, the story of intractable bureaucracy with the wrong people in positions of power and decision-making is a familiar one in both government and private enterprise.

And it would be a dispiriting one, if not for the character of the ""whistle-blowers"" interviewed.

Their courage, capability, dedication, and determination to do the right thing inspires hope.",1382659200,,669,5.795918367346939
8402491,5,B003QRMV38,"I found it to be an very interesting look at the foolishness of the TSA and the flying security system. It isn't totally comprehensive, but it helps cement the fact that much of what goes on is ""security theater, "" often really just done to make grandma THINK she is safe.",1379030400,,272,4.352941176470588
8402492,4,B003QRMV38,"I had never heard of this movie until I was recently reading an article about the TSA that talked about it, so I had to see it but it wasn't available anyplace I could find to rent so I bought it.
The movie is from 2010 so it isn't quite current but it was, and is, very interesting. It pretty well lays out how the airline industry and the TSA got to this point of, in my opinion, over protection, while still letting the bad guys through!
I literally HATE to fly airlines anymore, and I'm a private pilot! But some places are worth being jammed in an aluminum tube, yes just like Sardines!, because it is a cheaper way to go on a long flight even over a private plane with the current costs of fuel etc.

If you can rent it or borrow a copy from a library, check it out. As I'd said above, if you want to get a good perspective of how things got the way they are it's very good. But being almost three years and counting out of date, don't buy it to get the most updated information.",1370822400,,985,4.051282051282051
8402493,5,B003QRMV38,"This is a fascinating story about several whistleblowers in the TSA, who wanted the agency to really protect citizens.  They tell their stories about rampant corruption, irrational standards and priorities, and a culture in which incompetent managers thwart all efforts to fix flaws in the system.  It's very interesting and well-done, and quite scary.  They interview so many people that my initial hope that really things are mostly okay and this is just a couple of hotheads complaining about isolated incidents...well, no.  It becomes clear that we all really should be concerned.  It's totally non-partisan, and the people they interview who are worried about these problems range from Tea Party guys to congressional democrats, and mostly are the frontline TSA people, many of whom are former Special Forces guys or former police officers.  (They tried to get TSA officials to counter the concerns with their side of the story but TSA declined to participate.)  This is just a fantastic documentary, and I wish everyone could see it.",1298332800,3,1039,5.18562874251497
8402494,5,B003QRMV38,"This documentary confirmed what I already suspected: The TSA is just another governmental organization like the FAA who can't get their act together enough to do really anything to advance the protection of air or ship travelers who come through the USA.  They spend money on ""new"" technology but can't afford to train and maintain it so it sits unused in warehouses and the archaic things they are doing, e.g. take off shoes, only allow 3 oz of liquid bottles in a quart-size Ziploc baggy, miss many truly ""terrorist"" activities as the real terrorists are lightening years a head of them in their techniques of getting pass ""Checkpoint Charlie"".
If the USA government were really interested in ""protection"" they would streamline the process of exchange of information with other governments worldwide and stop harassing the average person trying to travel for business and/or leisure with their ""make believe"" safety features installed since 911.
I would recommend this documentary to anyone with doubts about travel safety or for that matter anyone whoever travels.  Until the flying and boating public (American or otherwise) starts scrutinizing what we are being asked to do in the name of ""safety"" we will remain sheep being herded by a government that is more interested in being perceived as one who's concerned about the safety of those traveling instead of putting their careers on the line finding way to stop terrorism without the public having to be put through the wringer every time they pass through a port of entry.",1287446400,8,1531,5.047430830039525
8402495,5,B003QRMV38,"This documentary took a long time in the making, but it is now out and well worth the wait.  I applaud all Federal Whistleblowers who stand up and tell their stories.  As a former federal whistleblower myself, it isn't easy and the retaliation is beyond words, but in the end the ""right"" always wins.  Often times, we are not allowed to disclose the entire cases or the discipline of those found at fault.  There is always more to the story that the public never hears about, but just know that there are so many of us horn blowers that blow because we felt/feel it was/is the right thing to do.  As public servants it is our duty to do so for the public safety and best interest.  There will be a book out next year titled, ""A Walk in my Shoes"" a true story of one federal whistleblower within the Department of Interior-Bureau of Land Management on the West coast.  It will be a must read.",1281312000,7,891,4.331325301204819
