2330572,5,B0009WSO6G,"Note: Please read my review of volume 1 first.

With 40-60% viewership for weekly episodes, Dae Jang Geum is one of the highest rated TV shows in Korea. The series was immensely popular in other countries including China, Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. There's even Dae Jang Geum theme park and some of the routes on Asiana Airlines are painted with Dae Jang Geum photos. And it is easy to see why. It is an epic filled with well-defined characters and complex plot. Many of the supporting characters are not ""cookie cutter"" 1-dimensional figures, but fully realized with their own stories.

This volume 2 box-set continues where episode 18 (of volume 1) left off, as the competition between Lady Han (with Jang Geum) and Lady Choi (with Geum Yung) heats up. Remarkable turn of events test Jang Geum's perseverance. When all hopes seem lost, friendships will help Jang Geum regain her strength. Her enemies are villainous and strong, but her friends are greater in number and royal to the end. Wow, that sounded like Lord of the Rings synopsis. =)

By the end of volume 2, many of the supporting casts fully settle into their role and their characters gain additional dimension and depth. Young-ae Lee (who plays Jang Geum) is even more comfortable here, portraying an age closer to her own near the end of volume 2. She is particularly effective when ""speaking"" with her eyes than with words.

This box-set contains episodes 19 through 36, containing some of the best episodes of the series. Among my favorites is a small scene in episode 23 where Lady Min is given an opportunity to cook for a birthday party. It's a minor scene but cute and serves to enrich the supporting characters. This box-set features some of the saddest events as well. In fact, a plot leak caused many viewers in Korea to write a petition to lengthen one of their favorite characters' stay.

Dae Jang Geum is remarkable for its restraint. In volume 1, we were given a glimpse of forbidden relationship between Jang Geum and Jung Ho. In volume 2, their chemistry solidifies with just brief physical contacts. Respectfully holding hands and leaning against each other can be as electrifying as any kiss.

I want to mention the use of music. Although occasionally cheesy and repeated ad nauseum, it plays a key role in the series. Many of the themes serve to enhance rather than annoy. Kurosawa-inspired photography in Jeju island is also remarkable for a TV series. Ditto for authentic set and costumes.

Episodes 19 through 21 complete the competition between Lady Han and Lady Choi. Episodes 22 through 27 present the bitter aftermath. Episodes 28 through 31 take place in Jeju island, one of the furthest stretches of Korea. Here, among the happiest times for Jang Geum, she enters the world of medicine. From episodes 32, Jang Geum attempts to re-enter the palace as the medicine woman. Back then, medical practitioners were lower in rank than chefs! New challenges and conflicts unfold, new friendships are forged, new enemies are made, and new powerful allies emerge.

If you enjoyed this volume, and I personally enjoyed it even more than volume 1, you are in for a treat on volume 3. Please look for my review of volume 3.",1167177600,15,3238,4.832129963898917

8068744,5,B0009WSO6G,"Amazon, please please try your hardest and best to get the full series of the DAE JANG GEUM series - of course it must be compatible to our Region viewing in UK.

It really is such a wonderful series. I was watching it on Botswana Television but just as they were nearing the ending of the last series, B.T.V. removed it completely from their program line up (for the football series, I think!!)

Well you can imagine - there was a furious outcry from hundreds of viewers in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe - there was begging and pleading - there were hundreds of letters written - but to no avail - B.T.V. stood firm in their decision.

I often come to this page to see if you, Amazon, have managed to obtain this full series and always find it's still not available.

So please PLEEEEEZE Amazon - you'll make many DAE JANG GEUM fans happy veeeery happy.:-)",1363824000,,863,4.443037974683544

8068748,5,B0009WSO6G,"This 3 volume series is the best foreign one I have ever seen.  It was not tedious, considering the length of it, and very informative of the period in which it is depicted.  It is one an entire family could watch and enjoy, because it has so many attributes and shows the greed, of the powerful and the honor of those who serve others, no matter what hardships befall them.  The perseverance of the main character is so admirable, you can't help but love her and the male character who looks after her welfare throughout the whole story. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",1271203200,,579,4.495238095238095
8068749,5,B0009WSO6G,"I saw what was called ""The Great Jang Guem"" on the Korean station here in Chicago.  My reception was horrible and the translation was not the best.
But I managed to get through.  Everytime I tried to find it I could not. I was talking with my Korean friend around the Holidays and she explained how her family dresses in the traditional Hanbok dresses as do the men in her family wear traditional Korean menswear. I went online and was directed to Amazon.com and there before my eyes no longer than 30 seconds later my old pal Jang Guem was available with English subtitles.  I ordered it immediately.  The music is outstanding and I also ordered the Soundtrack which I am waiting to receive from Japan.  I highly reccommend this film to anyone who is willing to put in the time to watch it.  I have watched at least 1 episode per day and I can't wait to start over and watch it again.  Simply the best!!",1232841600,,904,4.377245508982036
