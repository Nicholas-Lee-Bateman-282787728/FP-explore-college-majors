2410584,5,B000BB7JE8,I tried it with my 5 month old daughter and she giggled and laughed like crazy the first time and the second time she chuckled a little at first and then fell asleep to the motions.  The strength-building exercises are great bonding moments for us because she just sits there and grins at me!  What could be better motivation than someone who is always on your side and having fun along with you?  I am enjoying it immensely and looking forward to it being a regular part of my day!,1235692800,4,482,4.333333333333333
2410585,5,B000BB7JE8,The music is great.  The instructor is sweet and she does a wonderful job instructing you on the steps involved.  The workout is complete.  The fact that there are 6 dances helps you tailor a workout program to your needs and ability.  The floor exercises do a good job of targeting the areas that the dances don't.  The entire DVD has become a wonderful routine for my 4 month old son and me that we will continue to do for as long as he fits in a carrier and an experience I will never forget and that will undoubtedly forge a bond between us that will last a long time.,1231632000,2,572,4.163636363636364
2410586,4,B000BB7JE8,"Terrific idea, although the instructor is (at first) hard to follow.  Try it out when you're not too tired and keep practicing--you'll find you can do these routines--and they are fun!!!  I don't do gym routines on a regular basis, so these were tough for me at first, but I kept at it.  It;s the only momma & baby routine I've found that works.  Plus, my baby actually goes to sleep after we do the warm-up and dance #1 (or sometimes after these and a second round of dance #1).  No joke--we all win.",1231286400,7,501,4.287234042553192
2410587,4,B000BB7JE8,This DVD is great fun!  My son loves it and gets into the music when we work out!  Defintely a must by for new moms who need more than plain ole inspiration to work out!!,1223251200,3,170,3.8285714285714287
2410588,5,B000BB7JE8,"After having my baby, I couldn't go to the gym... because I had a baby to care for! This video is perfect. Not only does it have several upbeat dances to dance along to while holding your baby, it also has floor exercises you can do with your baby. This is perfect if you want to exercise with your baby.",1214438400,3,304,4.083333333333333
2410589,5,B000BB7JE8,"I love this DVD! It's good exercise and my baby loves it! I'm sure there are probably more intense work-outs out there, but it'd be hard to do them with baby and with dance you can really choose how much you put into it - I always end up sweating!

The DVD has a series of dances, strength exercises on the floor and stretching on the floor. The instructor explains everything well, taking baby into consideration. I hardly even realize I'm working out because it's so interactive. My baby loves both the dance and floor part. He'll smile up at me or fall asleep while dancing  and just laughs and laughs during some of the floor moves (sometimes he's fussy so we miss some parts of the floor exercises, but that's just life with baby).

Why I really love this DVD is that some days I'm just not motivated to work out and plan to skip it. But then baby gets fussy and I know this DVD will solve it, whether it's the dancing putting him to sleep, or playing together through the floor exercises. So I'll pop in whichever seems to fit his mood (then usually end up doing the other section after!) Highly recommend.",1177286400,15,1112,4.388349514563107
2410590,5,B000BB7JE8,"My husband got this for me as a Christmas gift. My 7 month old daughter and I have so much fun dancing to the latin tunes. I wish I had gotten this as a shower gift so that we could have been dancing with it sooner. I really enjoy the relaxed format. The music is so much fun and I almost feel like I'm on vacation. The best part is that there is no special equipment needed, but I do reccomend a front/back carrier for older heavier children, shoes are optional and no special outfits required. My daughter loves to be in her carrier and is always fast alseep by the end of dance #4. We haven't had a chance to try the floor exercise portion since she falls asleep in her carrier during the dance portion but I have watched it through and it looks beneficial. I highly reccomend this CD for any new mom!",1135814400,8,804,4.160256410256411
2410591,5,B000BB7JE8,"I love Latin dance so I was thrilled when I could  share this passion with new mothers with fussy babies.  Susan Peach is a very friendly instructor who is obviously very thorough in her approach.  Her two concerns seem to be safety and fun.  It is hard to have fun if you can't follow the moves and she breaks down the steps on this video so that even mothers who have no dance experience can very easily follow.  When the little ones are asleep she then invites the mothers to go to a section where they can learn the steps on their own again very well presented.  I think my favorite part of any video is the outtakes at the end.  It shows that the DVD was professionally done but by a real human being.  You will see Mambo Moms stepping on trees!  Well, I don't want to give the plot away but do consider this DVD for yourself or keep a couple on hand for a unique shower gift.  No one else can top this gift and since I am a grandmother and my daughters are going to lots of showers I always keep the DVD on hand.  It is timeless! I would highly recommend it.",1126137600,5,1064,4.091787439613527
8084394,5,B000BB7JE8,"This is a great workout with baby.  I purchased this to do with my granddaughter while I was the Granny nanny.  She loved it.  Often put her to sleep when she was really young.  At around 5-6 months, she loved the cha-cha-cha rhythm.",1514505600,,233,4.348837209302325
8084395,5,B000BB7JE8,"Absolutely love this work out dvd. I received it back when I had my first child and it helped me lose all of my pregnancy weight within 5 months. Now I'm on my 3rd child and using it again! Puts my kids right to sleep even on their super fussy nights within a half hour they are out.

Yes it's cheesy but it works!!",1480896000,,315,3.921875
8084396,1,B000BB7JE8,this DVD is awful!  Video quality - awful!  dance moves - awful! cheesy and super lame!  I think this woman made this lame DVD out of her garage. So mad that I wasted my money on this!,1406678400,,184,3.918918918918919
8084397,5,B000BB7JE8,"I tried this workout with my 9 month old daughter and she loves it!  She falls right to sleep into the 3rd dance and I get a great workout.  I have other videos, but they're meant for younger babies that actually stay still.  This is a workout you can do with a baby of any age.",1344297600,,278,3.9285714285714284
8084398,3,B000BB7JE8,"This DVD is easy to follow along, and has great strength exercises at the end of 5th dance set. The value is in these strength exercises, as the rest of the dances don't involve the baby, aside from having him/her in a carrier during the dances. The dances are light workouts, so this DVD can not be the main tool in getting back into shape, but it is a great way to get back into a routine.",1324166400,,391,4.090909090909091
8084399,5,B000BB7JE8,"I just started using this dvd recently, with my 7 week old son. It has been an absolute life saver! When he gets extra fussy, I put on the dvd, go through two of the dances while holding him in my arms, and bam, he's asleep. He seems to really like the music, and the sound and pitch of the instructor's voice. As for the workout itself, I really enjoy it. As I mentioned above, the instructor's voice is very pleasant and soothing. The music is very enjoyable. Yes, the steps are hard (they get progressively harder), but the more I practice the steps, the better I get. The instructor's cueing is generally good, and it's fun watching the other moms and babies. So all in all, this dvd is definitely a winner! I am recommending this to my other mom friends with babies.",1317945600,,771,4.361111111111111
8084400,1,B000BB7JE8,"I was disappointed in this video. Having read other reviews, and the advertisements I thought this would be really fun. I have not been able to make it through the entire video. All of the ""dances"" seemed to be the same, only minor variations. I never felt like I was dancing, just trying to move my feet to follow the women on the screen, who also didn't seem to be dancing. I could not get my hips to follow the instructor, and she gave very little help other than which direction to move your feet. The rocking movement may be soothing for the baby, but I am not going to complete a workout that is boring for me. The movements also required very little exertion. I really did not feel like I was gaining many exercise benefits.

I was impressed with the way this DVD was organized. You do not have to do the entire workout. You can skip directly to any song you like. I wish more exercise DVDs were set up that way.",1265328000,2,919,4.251428571428572
8084401,5,B000BB7JE8,"This dvd is a blast.  Fun,challenging dances and good, simple floor exercises.  I have to skip a few dances and go to the floor routine if I want to do it with the baby, because she's usually sound asleep by the end of #4!",1238371200,,222,4.0227272727272725
8084402,1,B000BB7JE8,"Susan Peach is unclear, hard to follow, boring and stumpy. I felt like i was stomping around stupidly for hours. Its not fun at all. I love Mambo dance and this DVD made me feel like an elephant, or like I would end up with elephant legs. I hate this DVD.",1237334400,2,255,4.019607843137255
8084403,4,B000BB7JE8,"All in all - a great introduction to latin dance and a great way for a new mom to get off the couch and move a bit.

What you get - a warm up dance, 6 dance routines (2 merengue, 2 salsa, 2 cha cha cha), floor exercises with baby and some relaxing stretches, all with baby. There is also a bonus dance and some out takes, which are in a different section of the DVD.

The plus side: Peach is a sweet instructor - pleasant, calm and motivating. The dance routines are fun and not too confusing, once you've done them a couple of times, but you do get a nice sweat. The baby is involved or in your arms the entire workout - you don't have to put them aside to watch you for a single moment, unlike other mom-baby DVDs out there. The floor exercises are not too hard and are well known mom-baby classics. Real mothers are shown - not super pretty models.

The minus side: The reason why this lovely DVD looses a star is that babies are shown with their heads hanging forward or sideways from the baby sling without support during some of the dances. I think it is not good for the babies - so watch out - do as Peach does - hold your baby in your arms for maximum support for baby and nice arm workout for yourself! I missed having an option to turn off the instruction and just do the dances without cuing once I've learned them.

You should also know: Some of the music has kind of a Jazzy take on it - which makes it hard to follow for the musically challenged like myself.

All in all - the DVD is quite expensive, but I found it was worth it, and would definitely recommend it to any new mom.",1236124800,5,1594,4.079872204472843
