8269155,3,B0018BEGJQ,I liked this movie to a point. First of all it is just music and requires the parents to sit and talk with the children. The whole reason I put a movie on is to get things done while my daughter's attention is held. For me it would work well when parents are sitting there folding laundry and can talk with the child about what is being shown on the screen. I do however love the variety that it had on it and it played music that would be tolerable to watch a couple times before getting tired of it. All in all I think it is a good movie to watch while folding laundry in the living room.,1405987200,,590,3.966386554621849
8269156,4,B0018BEGJQ,This is the third Baby IQ video we have purchased for our 10 month old grandbaby.  It is great for long road trips where you need a few minutes of stretching those last miles in before the next stop.  The music and pictures are soothing to adults and babies.  I'm not one for using videos as entertainment but these have been helpful from time to time.,1294617600,,352,4.303030303030303
