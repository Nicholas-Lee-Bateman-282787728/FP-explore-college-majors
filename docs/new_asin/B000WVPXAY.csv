2992360,5,B000WVPXAY,I have a friend who Dances and she is amazing. I went to watch her perform and enjoyed the  dancing very much. She told me about the  Goddess Workout: Intro to Bellydance video's. I decided to purchase the beginner video and I am very pleased with it. It is fun and enjoyable. I feel great after doing the routine. It works every part of the body. I have back and hip pain and I feel that it has helped me in that area. I would definitely  recommend this product.,1212192000,,463,4.179775280898877
2992361,5,B000WVPXAY,"I find Dolphina very pleasant. She is a good instructor and goes at a slower pace (as this video is intended for the beginners). Some of the exercises you have to practice at so they don't feel as awkward. If you stick with it, it's a nice way to use muscles you didn't realise you had!",1210291200,,286,4.125
2992362,3,B000WVPXAY,"I'm giving this one as many as three stars only because it was the first belly dance video I got as a beginner, and I enjoyed it then. Thank goodness I was also taking classes, though, because the quality of instruction on this video is pretty poor. There are times when what she says isn't what she's doing, times when what she says doesn't make sense, and times when what she says is just plain wrong. Probably the best things about this video are the warm up and cool down, which are fairly good.

If you want a belly dance video with a Goddess orientation, buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dancing-The-Sacred-Shapes-with-The-Goddess-Dancing/dp/B000CNEF4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dancing The Sacred Shapes with The Goddess Dancing</a>. The quality of instruction on that one is much better; you will learn to do the movements correctly and not hurt yourself.

P.S. Maybe this was just my own cluelessness, but as a beginner I never could figure out what made Dolphina's undulations look so different from the ones I was seeing in class. A couple of years later when I dusted this video off and watched it again, I burst out laughing because I realized that the answer is super simple: instead of the more commonly seen Arabic 1 (flat, ball), she's doing it with an Arabic 2 (Flat, ball, ball, ball), which gives a little bit of a level change, and makes it look a bit different. Of course, she doesn't bother to mention the footwork, so as a beginner, it drove me absolutely crazy trying to figure it out!",1208390400,7,1569,5.054054054054054
2992363,4,B000WVPXAY,"People seem to love dissing poor Dolphina, but this really is a good intro to bellydance DVD. It says it's a workout-it's not (you'll never get your heartrate up high enough).However,if you are looking to learn the core foundations of bellydance, this is actually a great DVD. I agree with the people who said that the camera focuses on her face when it should be focusing on her body, and I found her explaination of undulations a bit confusing, but if you do this DVD enough, you will pick up the moves.",1206057600,3,505,4.5
2992364,1,B000WVPXAY,I wouldn't waste your money on this workout. I am 150 lbs overweight and I barely broke a sweat doing this workout.  Waving your arms is not a cardio workout. Plus you spend more time looking at her face then her fit. I know how to smile!,1204588800,3,238,4.0638297872340425
2992365,1,B000WVPXAY,"I would NOT recommend anyone bother to waste their money on a video that stars Dolphina.  Sure she knows what she is doing and looks great doing it but that's about as good as it gets.  If you want to learn to bellydance this is NOT a series for you!  The cues are terrible, a lot of camera time is spent on her face so you don't really know what you are doing.  If you try to imitate her moves without seeing how to properly perform the moves, you WILL INJURE YOURSELF! My advice.....STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!",1204329600,6,511,4.237113402061856
2992366,5,B000WVPXAY,"About five years ago, I was doing a weight-loss program and picked up this video for regular exercise.  I was surprised at how much fun I had, that I could discover muscles that I didn't even know were there and how to control them.  The video helped me lose quite a bit of weight and I was so pleased with it.

In the past two years, during several personal struggles, my weight crept back up to where it had been.  However, I noticed that my posture was better and I could move more gracefully, improvements I credit to the Goddess Workout.  I have started to do the video again, at a higher weight than I started doing it the last time, and was surprised to find that it was still simple and fun to do.  (I thought it would be harder at this weight.)  It's low-impact, makes you sweat just a little, and before you know it, you've done a 45-minute basic workout that stretches you out and calms you down.

If you are really truly wanting to learn how to bellydance, I have heard that this video is not good for that.  However, if you just want to be active for a little while, try this.",1203292800,15,1089,4.222222222222222
2992367,4,B000WVPXAY,"i was definatly sore the next day after doing this ( then again im really out of shape). it is fun and dolphina ( the instructor) is very motivating being skinny & pretty.  I would have given it 4 stars except that for some of the parts where your doing foot moves, the camera is zoomed in on her face and you don't know what your supposed to be doing. She gives verbal cues and then it shows the steps half way thoruhg. So perhaps if you watch it / do it several times you would be able to master the moves and know what to do , even though they don't show it right away.",1201392000,5,572,3.9310344827586206

8225778,5,B000WVPXAY,"This is my favorite bellydance DVD of all time. I started out with this video and then tried all the others and always come back to The Goddess Workout. The quality of instruction is very clear & Dolphina breaks everything down. It never gets old or boring. I always get something out of it and always feel uplifted after doing it. But there is something magical about the Intro to Bellydance Goddess Workout: it is stunning to look at, I love all her costumes, the locations, the music, all the different tidbits that Dolphina shares with you about bellydance, history, movements, chakras, motivation, mystical - but most of all, I just feel like a Goddess whenever I do this video.",1480982400,2,683,4.7
8225779,5,B000WVPXAY,"Dolphina is lovely, wears beautiful costumes and uses terrific scenery for background on her exercise DVD. She is wonderful for older would be dancers. This DVD contains a nice easy exercise routine, working snake arms, hips, and upper body each in a brief sequence of gentle toning moves. It is definitely in the easy category, but wonderful repetition for any beginning dancer.",1440028800,,379,5.129032258064516

8225785,4,B000WVPXAY,"Sure, Dolphina is a poor actress and kind-of obnoxious... but if you take it with a grain of salt, smile a little and put on a bit of your own ""Diva"" attitude, it helps!
Having attended a few belly dance classes, this is not good, legitimate training if you want to go in that direction. The camera work is obviously not the best in terms of showing you what Dolphina is doing with all the parts of her body you really ought to be able to see in order to know whats going on. Nonetheless, if you lighten-up, roll with it and are able to improvise it's still a fun workout that gets you moving.
Definitely NOT for those concerned with perfect technique, or who need exact instruction in order to stay engaged.",1363737600,,708,4.330827067669173
