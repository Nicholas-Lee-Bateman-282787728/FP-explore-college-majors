8056699,5,B000928VZ0,"The title is ""the Doper's Guide to Amsterdam"". It is not meant to subject the viewers to 1:43 hours of watching people toking. It is a guide to Amsterdam with some basic and valuable info for a few of the coffee shops the good-intentioned hand-held camera operators and documentary-style commentators have chosen to highlight. There are ""chapters"" on 'phone cards, currency, transportation and so on.
There are benefits for returning visitors. I learned two or three ""basics"" for my tenth visit in about six weeks from this date.
A great benefit to me is the memories of past visits, acting as sort of video personal photo album.",1392854400,,629,4.88785046728972
8056700,5,B000928VZ0,"I was in Amsterdam many times and I love this city. I bought the DVD and I can only recommend it to everybody. The DVD is well done, I'm very disappointed with the review below. If you liked Amsterdam's coffee shops this DVD is the right one for you because is filled with coffee shop shots. I will buy one for my friend for his upcoming birthday I'm sure that it will be a nice gift because he was in Amsterdam only once and has great memories about that vacation. As I said it's a nice gift, 5/5 without any doubt.",1187136000,6,516,4.118811881188119
8056701,1,B000928VZ0,"My wife and I have been to Amsterdam a few times and were really excited about purchasing this DVD. However, upon viewing the low quality and uninspiring visuals we were both extremely disappointed. It looked and felt like a home made video from people who wanted to try and capitalize on the ""travel Amsterdam"" craze. Also, using the term ""Doper's"" in the title is very misleading. Only a fraction of the DVD's content is about Coffeeshops and it's culture.  Furthermore, the host might not have been the best choice to host the ""Doper's"" guide to Amsterdam. His opening statement says it all when he starts to compare Amsterdam to hand lotion and rambles through this monologue about smoothing out the roughness of life...What!???  And last but not least, the cameraman. Throughout the DVD, we are bombarded with visuals of workmen and cleaning crews picking their noses and cleaning streets and ponds. It looked like a five year old shot this whole video on a camera phone, which would make sense, because there is one scene of kids getting out of school that last forever and is recycled throughout the entire movie.  This is only one of the many pointless shots in the DVD.  For example: one shot during the section called ""eye candy"" where you literally watch the front of a commuter train that goes on forever because the camera is set up at the back of the train in front of it.  Why??  Just when you think it's over they shoot a tour guide talking for five minutes, but you can't hear anything she is saying.  With so many beautiful shots of Amsterdam, I have to ask, why are we watching this??  This movie seemed like a great idea, but was very poorly executed and at a price of $20.00, this was one of the most worthless purchases we've ever made. We strongly reccomend that you stay far away from this DVD, save up your money, and go to Amsterdam yourself. With the $25.00 your spending on the cost of this DVD and shipping, you can buy that Museum card they went on and on about.",1169683200,14,1992,4.560224089635854
8056702,5,B000928VZ0,"Amsterdam is such an amazing place that it is very hard to capture the feel of it and this DVD does that! Lots of greats information and visuals - I play this whenever I want to remember what AAmsterdam feels like.

Instead of trying to explain to my friends what Amsterdam is like, I just lend them my copy. For several special friends, I bought them their own. Now all my friends want to go!

My favorite travel DVD of my favorite city.",1144713600,8,438,4.265060240963855
