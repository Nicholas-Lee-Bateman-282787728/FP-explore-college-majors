8257565,4,B00154ZF3W,"You've never heard of Lois Butler.  Neither had I.  Adter making the movie, she played the love interest in :""Boy From Indiana"" (about a guy raising a horse) and in ""High Lonesome"",(a horse opera).  Either she was upstaged by the horses (many actors are warned against sharing the camera with an animal) or else she got married, for other than an appearance on Mario Anza's show, nobody ever saw hide nor hair of her again.

And that's a shame.  Her hide and her hair were quite adequate, as was her acting, but her voice was exceptional.  At one point, Mickey and her friend are trying to foster a romance for Mickey's widowed dad, do they play his favorite song (""If I Were the Only Girl in the World"") on the front porch, while Mickey sings along.  After the ladyfriend leaves, Mickey's dad comments that the now-absent woman thought it was the radio, rather than Mickey's singing, and that line sounds quite reasonable.  She also sings ""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" before an auditorium,

This movie has much in common with Gidget - an wholesome and attractive teenaged daughter of a widower runs into problems when her confidence exceeds her experience, but things end up OK in the end, except Mickey doesn't have a surfboard and bikini, and the electric guitar wasn't around yet. It's not gut-busting funny in the manner of ""Airplane!"" and ""Kentucky Fired Movie"" but it's quite amusing, and entertaining in a wqay most sitcoms fail to achieve..",1426550400,,1451,4.749003984063745

8257567,4,B00154ZF3W,"This 2007 DVD from Feature Films For Families contains nearly the same 104 minute version of 'Mickey' as the 2005 DVD from Starz/Anchor Bay (check Versions on Imdb.com for a list of edits) but none of the same Extra Features. Rather, it features a 4 question ""Parents Guide for Family Discussion"" illustrated with 4 clips from the feature (parents must supply their own answers), previews of four FF4F DVDs and a message and a mission statement from FF4F. Most reviewers slam 'Mickey' for featuring a tax cheating widower father who flees the IRS by getting new identities for himself and his son (now Glen and Mickey), which coincidentally enable the boy to break the Little League Baseball age rule. FF4F takes the tact that, since they have to fess up to their actions, these are teachable moment for parents to share with their children. The three principal boys are good baseball players who provide solid acting performances, making the action realistic. The film was independently produced by writer John Grisham and director Hugh Wilson, neighbors in Charlottesville, Virginia, using a great deal of local talent.",1287705600,,1121,5.064864864864865
