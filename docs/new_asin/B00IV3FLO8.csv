6297628,5,B00IV3FLO8,"An unbelievably good series.  Nothing is as it initially appears, but somehow it all makes sense in a real and gritty way.  The first two seasons are pure gold, being a self-contained cycle in and of themselves.  The third and fourth are not quite as good, but better than 98% of the shows out there.

6297634,5,B00IV3FLO8,"This is an astoundingly great follow-up to the ultra-violent season one. Sex scenes also abound, as everyone is sleeping with everyone else. There are so many characters, one might think it would be hard to follow just who is paired with whom and who is committing what crime, aided or opposed by whom, as loyalties and alliances fluctuate. There is incredible violence in every episode, and at some point, Lucas Hood starts wearing a bandage on his right wrist. He wears it right into season three, so he must have been badly injured in one of those fight scenes, no matter how carefully choreographed. Carrie's secret past - or some of it - has now been revealed, and her murderous Ukrainian father, a feared mob boss from NYC, is after her. Her daughter, Deva, now knows that Hood is her biological father, but she is following in both parents' footsteps by attempting to commit crimes. Proctor's niece, Rebecca, who was shunned by her Amish family and took shelter with him, is being initiated into his world of crime and taking to it with considerable enthusiasm. The new chief of the Kinaho tribe has to defend his reign against usurpers, while his sister makes no attempt to curb her murderous impulses. One of the best things about this series, which is crammed with subplots, is that time is managed to reveal the histories of characters and their interactions. I can't say that any are truly well-rounded - some, like Job, appear fully formed and never alter - but all are interesting. Even the most unlikeable have likeable moments, and even the most likeable can be repulsive. One thing to beware of: sooner or later, everyone dies. At the end of the day, no matter how much you've engaged with a character, that person will be gruesomely dead.",1492905600,,1756,4.741830065359477

6297727,5,B00IV3FLO8,"To put it bluntly, I was amazed!  Note that I do have cable TV but that I do not subscribe to the titty channels, so that the relatively infrequent nudity and just-below X-rated sex was a delightful surprise, as were the frequent F-bombs that occurred exactly when expected (as they would in a more or less real-life situation, depending on your personal experiences).  My partner was offended by the language (and the sex) so I had to watch this all alone but that didn't mean I enjoyed it any less.

You can get the plot anywhere (Wiki is a good place to start) so I'll not go into that.  What I will HIGHLY recommend is watching each season's BANSHEE ORIGINS set of clips so you can get a heads up on what you're about to see without having to figure it out piecemeal from the episodes themselves.  Note that this is absolutely necessary at the beginning of season four, where a lapse of 18-months has occurred.

The clips were scripted and shot separately from the episodes themselves, as explained by the producers on the commentary audio.  I had originally thought that they were outtakes or sections that were cut for time purposes but that was not the case.  THEY DO EXPLAIN A BUNCH OF STUFF!

I can say that each season opens with a whole new set of problems and a bunch of characters whom the writers were not afraid of killing off just to torment the survivors and shock the audience.

To save time and effort, this same review will be posted for seasons 2 through 4 (the last season of the series).",1483833600,,1510,4.478102189781022

Bashee is truly unparalleled, I can't say enough good things about the entire cast. The action sequences are stunning - I somehow fear that there is a shallow graveyard somewhere of dead stunt men and stunt women behind the studio that produced this series.

6298136,5,B00IV3FLO8,"This is a well-scripted series.  It does contain some nudity and there is ample violence in the form of fighting.  The star is virtually unknown (to me), but he seems to be Van Damme, Seagal and Jason Bourne all wrapped in one.  He eventually wins the fights, but not before going thru hell.  I was hooked on Season 1, and waited for Season 2 to be available for Prime members.  I expect Season 3 and 4 will also be available at some point in the near future.  There is plenty of action to say the least.  Each episode seems to end way too quickly.  Enjoy!",1472342400,,556,4.228571428571429

If you are the type that likes your story hard core where everything doesn't always work as planned than give Banshee a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised!,1468627200,,473,4.208791208791209

6298665,5,B00IV3FLO8,"This season of Banshee is so entertaining that watching regular network TV  after was painfully boring. My wife and I binge watched all the episodes over a 2 day period, if we didn't have jobs we would have watched all episodes in one night. If you are squeamish about violence and r rated sex then this is not for you. If you aren't then your in for a rollercoaster  ride of multiple plot lines, great fight scenes, and also a study of morality. All the characters are multi- dimensional, so forget this show if you like obvious good guy bad guy paradigms. But if you like cutting edge plotlines and realistic portrayals of human emotions then this is for you. The unrealistic part is that many characters appear superhuman. This is an escape from reality, in that we see ordinary humans doing extra ordinary things. Strongly recommended as are many of the great shows on Amazon , like Veep, Transparent, and Catastrophe.",1466467200,,922,4.685185185185185

6298678,5,B00IV3FLO8,Great show,1466467200,,10,4.5
6298679,3,B00IV3FLO8,This show is entertaining. Just like to the know what happens to the characters. The show is ridiculous in its violence and how much a person can take getting beat up. In one scene the cop is talking to his girlfriend and has no bruises or scratches. Then the next they are all there on his face. In reality. This guy would have had brain damage or just be dead as much pounding he gets.  It is a little disturbing that everyone resorts to threats or violence immediately. We really call that assault and battery. Hopefully parents don't let their kids watch this. Hate to have them thinking this is what they are supposed to be like.  But for adults it is a nice break.  Hey one thing is I get all the eye candy being a man.  My wife complains they never show the dudes junk but the girls are all naked.  So FYI.  And the writers have no idea how a beef packing plant operates. They have suits in on the killing floor-not allowed by USDA. They kill and cut up and package all on one floor. Could never be done. And it is the cleanest packing house I have ever seen.  No blood.  Another thing how big is this little town.  This place is huge for a little town. And any small town nobody has secrets. Not the ones I have lived in. And it only has 4 cops. I liked the school scene where all 4 cops where out front. The bad guys could have gone out a back window and just walked away. Well anyway it is stupid show but I like picking it apart and the sex and the violence.,1466467200,,1469,4.108391608391608

6298703,5,B00IV3FLO8,This show is awesome!!!I only have one critic about it and that is there is way to much needless sex! It was such a action packed show and the sex scenes really took away from the core of the show. I think sometimes it  ruins how good a show truly is when the SAME 2 people are having sex with EVERYONE.Every episode had  very explicit sex scenes in it and it truly didn't add anything to the show. I really hope season 4 gets away from the sex and just focuses on what the show is all about.....,1466294400,,496,4.051020408163265

For PRIME customers there should be some sort of warning about the impending nickel and dime charges that are about to occur down the line.... or better yet, how about not charging at all?????  It would be much better (customer relations) if you set the expectations right from the beginning. Either you charge for the entire series or you don't.

6298958,4,B00IV3FLO8,"If you remember Archie and Edith Bunker singing, about ""Sex and Violence"" on TV, This is what they were singing about. But it is mesmerizing, in a way. It is action Packed with great Characters, and so easy to get sucked in to them.
One thing this show is, is not boring. Although personally, I'd prefer a little less violence, the sex scences are very adult.
This is Cable Television after all. I'd rate it R, for adults
I was definitely binging on it, and was a bit disappointed, that season 3 was not included with Prime Membership, Just the first two seasons.

I really have a had time watching the scenes which depict violent acts against defenseless women, but love the ones where the acting is so incredible, you wished they conducted workshops for other actors. Hoon Lee as Job, the drag queen, tech genius Ninja is at the top of his game. Raised Amish, Ulrich Thomsen as shunned Kai Proctor is pure evil. The strikingly beautiful Ivana Milievi, as Carrie Hopewell (Ana) is a pleasure to watch just sitting on the counter in her kitchen. She is so comfortable with her body. Thank goodness she chose to bypass the silicone craze. Frankie Faison as Sugar, the ex-con bar owner's smile is infectious. As soon as he opens his mouth to offer some words of wisdom you can't help be perk up an ear. Anthony Ruivivar, as Alex Longshadow is amazing as the good looking bad boy can you be any more intense Indian Chief. The list goes on and on.",1465171200,,964,4.578034682080925

Punches are thrown and punches and kicks and sharp blades are landed... time and again... things go boom on and around our phoenix-like heroes (or villains, as you see fit to ascribe) and yet, and yet, the next minute, the next day, the next week (much as with ""Daredevil"") the battered blood-besplattered (especially the gooder of the baddies) are rendered once again whole, resumed in fine and ache-less fettle behind the seemingly uncompromisable shield of protagonism... and a jolly time is had by all.",1464652800,3,815,5.213740458015267

The most compelling character is the violent, gay, Asian computer hacker martial artist who more than makes up for the faults of the hero. He steals every scene. The women are spectacular and they also drive the action while the villains are complex, multifaceted and deadly.

By the eighth, I was sea sick, disappointed,  AND furious.  Blurry filter and multiple head shot angles so you know that the character is FEELING. Jump cuts and multiple time lines interspersed with black and white flashbacks AND alternate shoots of the same moments as they happen inside a character's head. Hand-held or harness shots for the most mundane action shots. Just TELL THE STORY. Just LET THE ACTORS DO THEIR JOB. Just... oh, just forget it.

6299175,4,B00IV3FLO8,"There's a new sheriff in town, and he'll beat up the baddies. There are no problems (moral, ethical, logistic) that Sheriff Hood can't solve by punching, staged with comic abandon. Because he has landed in a small Pennsylvania town with a lot of problems, he'll spend the season punching out everyone who deserves it, plus some guys who just happened to be in his way.

There is lots of sex too.  Women find the Sheriff irresistible.  Whereas the violence is integral to the plot (punching being the only way to resolve problems) the sex is just added on to balance things out.

If this sounds like the stupidest show ever thrown up on the web, well its actually better than that. By keeping expectations low, and delivering them with high reckless glee, it manages to succeed. Lead Antony Star has a manic gleam in his shifting eyes, and an appealing smile. He's likable between bouts.

Supporting actor Hoon Lee, who plays a cross dressing accomplice, is awesome. It would be daring if they were willing to show gay sex with Lee as explicit as they show straight sex with Star.",1464220800,,1079,4.657894736842105

In fact, I think that is why I selected Banshee, because I didn't like the thumbnail. Anyways, fell in love with the show. Season 2 wasn't quite as good as season one, but still the best viewing choice you can make. I don't have much time to watch TV, so when i do sit down to enjoy, I always find myself gong to Amazon Prime and selecting another episode of Banshee. Occasionally I watch something else, but all it does is cement how unbelievable Banshee is. The season finale was absolutely masterful.",1461715200,2,668,4.439024390243903

I have to admit that I like to story line and the characters very much. Its not a real deep story and there are plenty of action scenes to keep you engaged. Similar to the series (I also watched and recommend) Strike Back also from Cinemax the one nude scene per episode becomes just a little forced after awhile. So that aspect might make some folks uncomfortable, as it does me, when I know others are looking over my shoulder while sitting on a flight for 5 hours. All in all I have really enjoyed it and will look for w 3rd season. Warning; you have got to be comfortable fist fights and gunplay",1447286400,,747,4.304964539007092

6299411,2,B00IV3FLO8,"It suffers from HBO syndrome.

I love TV more than almost any other form of media. As someone who worked in countries where leaving the house alone was out of the question, I got very acquainted with the myriad of streaming and DVD options everywhere I have gone. Part of this is an innate knowledge of television archetypes. This particular show falls into something I have decided to call ""HBO Syndrome.""

Warning: the following review contains references to explicit material found within the show, but, honestly, what is your non-18 year old doing watching a show like this, anyway? Spoilers are intentionally avoided.

HBO Syndrome is where a television show delivers a fairly archetypal plot with a few characteristics that turn it into something the Emmy nominators like, such as:

(1) Shoot for ""gritty"" which is defined by having an ""antihero"" who does not do anything the rest of us find too morally objectionable. He doesn't kill policemen and only kills bad guys, who we are supposed to hate for their foreign accents. He has not committed a crime society is unwilling to forgive such as a sexual crime or harmed someone who the viewer wasn't supposed to hate in the first place (rapists, organized criminals with foreign accents, rednecks, etc.). Weirdly, this is apolitical in many ways, since it features piggish men/redknecks, a common target for the left, and foreign criminal elements, a common target for the right.

(2) Feature an ungodly volume of uninteresting and unnecessary sex scenes showing attractive women without clothing. Since the show, like those on HBO and Showtime, is featured on a non-network, premium television network, why not leverage that advantage into some good ole' fashioned softcore pornography? 90% of the sex scenes in these dramas (Game of Thrones, Homeland, Black Sails) are entirely unnecessary and are merely vehicles to show one or both of two things: (a) titillating scenes with attractive people to turn on the (usually male) viewer and (b) show that they are able to do this, unlike their network and basic cable competitors. This isn't to say that all the nude scenes in these shows are unnecessary. At one point during the first season, a character is physically (albeit not sexually) attacked while undressed after getting out of the shower and this does a good job of presenting the character's vulnerability to harm and her dependence on the attacker. It was a good scene that informed the plot and relationship between the characters. However, the innumerable indulgent scenes where characters visually ""reminisce"" about previous sexual experiences do nothing to move the plot along and are there merely for sexual gratification of the viewer or to show that they can include it. It borders on pornography and cheapens the occasionally lively plot.

(3) Ensure that your characters are never on the up and up or too far down. If a character is doing well, make sure that something tragic happens to them. Similarly, anyone doing poorly should have unexpected luck. Like in Game of Thrones, no character in any ""arty"" TV show should have a positive storyline for more than an episode or two. If your writers run out of drama inherent in the main plot points, have a few callbacks to previous points that make sure the viewer's anxiety stays piqued. What would be the point of a linear plot narrative? At every point in this show, there is always some insecurity that gets brought up for a cheap point in one episode only to get dropped and never referenced again. The character is having panic attacks from post-traumatic stress disorder at one point during a stressful scene. Future stressful scenes do not reference or use this previous character development because it doesn't work within the contrived scene they are shooting now. If you're a TV buff, think of Lost. At no point should there be a plot narrative that flows until the final episodes to safeguard viewership for the next season.

The show is going full HBO, to paraphrase Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder. This would be fine, if the show didn't take itself so seriously, but, as with all of these ""gritty"" dramas and, relatedly, comedies on the similar networks (House of Lies, Girls, etc.) the real drama is how much anxiety they can pump into the viewer. ""Does this character get tortured/assaulted/traumatized?"" becomes an end in itself rather than a means to developing a broader story arc. They make the scenes very explicit and outside of the main plot narrative, since the vicarious anxiety to the viewer is more of the goal than moving a story along or nuancing a character down the line. There are numerous scenes where a main character is a victim of a traumatizing attack but does not affect his or her functioning, outlook, behavior, or dynamic with the other characters beyond an episode or two so what's the point of introducing the event other than to cheaply spike the emotions of the viewer in an effort to be ""gritty.""

In this way, campy television shows like The Flash or Arrow actually perform more strongly, since events in characters' lives actually affect their relationships with each other down the line. My advice? Watch Luther or a show that actually incorporates the episodic events into the characters' main plot and overarching narrative. If television is the novel to film's short story, then this show is a serialized penny dreadful.",1442188800,,5399,4.951434878587197

6299424,5,B00IV3FLO8,"As riveting as Game of Thrones, Cinemax's Banshee comes with a modern (Pennsylvania), criminalized and evangelized twist. It showcases the deep, intensified emotional roller-coaster of a town overridden with corrupt city officials and organized criminals. However, there's still a goodness in the town itself and within many of the citizens living there. In the first season, the writers do a lot of character development (especially in episodes 1-3). However, the secrets of each of their personalities are actually revealed in small snippets within each episode. And that trend continues in season two. Banshee's overall story-line itself is definitely not for the faint at heart. There are immensely deviant plots sprinkled throughout both seasons one and two (and I can imagine even more in season three which is currently on pre-order). Season two delves even deeper into the main themes of the Banshee story: good vs. evil and the internal / external struggles that come with that battle i.e. crossroads, occupational struggles, political disorder, anger and revenge, sexual deviations, spiritual struggles, the impacts and aftershocks of emotional and physical abuse, as well as the human's ability to believe in the best regardless of the visible circumstances. The negatives to Banshee are: nudity, obscene language and the religion is placed in a overtly debauchery-type light.",1441411200,,1387,5.516431924882629

6299452,3,B00IV3FLO8,"The second season was just as compelling as the first.  Strong writing, intriguing, seemingly likable characters, though the later could change on a whim.  There's a lot to like, despite some occasional cheap music-video pandering in the photography and/or direction:  one episode in particular, almost half the episode felt like the director was just dragging it out with long, slow, scenery shots and facial closeups set to music, presumably to set the mood, but the mood was quickly lost by mere overstatement.  Also, like in the first season, there is at least one scene per episode that unnecessarily and quite blatantly devolves into cheap sexual exploitation, uncharacteristic of the more intelligent scripting and plots.  This is of course rather typical of HBO/Cinemax/Showtime original programming.  But most shows seem to grow past such shallow, obvious exploitative devices by their second year, at least limiting it to once or twice per season, rather than 10-20 percent of every episode.  This one hasn't yet, but I still have hope for it.  There's more good than bad.  It just doesn't always seem that way.

The Blu-ray of course is still, far and away, the best way to watch the show:  highest quality currently available and no having to wait a week to see what happens next.  Not to mention discs are the only movies you can actually own that you and your family can depend on for generations, and thus allow you to recover at least part of your investment when something doesn't prove worthy of the hype.  Fans may be disappointed at the scarcity of extras on this BD set though.",1439942400,2,1598,4.917910447761194

It is the old moral dilemma that conspires to create a character show where he endeavors to do the right thing while facing the possibility of discovery and having ties to remaining in place that keep him there.  Simple premise but also has a few twists where they run off on heists, etc.  We like this show because of how it plays out and shows the moral dilemmas not only faced by the protagonist, but also by most of the other players in the cast.  Since it plays on Cinemax, it has an almost obligatory sex scene every episode which can get old if it weren't almost every episode.",1439164800,,630,4.26890756302521

The story is as good as the first season , however I must say the ending does go over the top. But then this is fiction isn't it?  The final shootout this time takes place at a church in new York city and after many hundreds of rounds are fired the cops never show up!  But who in spite of that the show is fast paced and fun show. This show is NO way suitable for children though.  It's a ADULT show with sex scenes and lots of violence.

It is a little unbelieveable that a sheriff can kill that many people, even if while on the job, and not have outside people looking into his actions.  The story line is basically this: This guy gets released from jail after serving 15 years for robbing a diamond place.  He then starts looking for his ex girlfriend who was with him but he let her escape while with the diamonds while he took the wrap.  He finds her in the town of Banshee living under another name and married to the town DA.  While in town, a man who is coming to be the new sheriff, who no one has actually met or seen, gets killed in a bar that was being robbed. The Ex con takes his identity and becomes the new sheriff.  He then runs the town in a un conventinal way but it is effective.  Oh ya, it is Omish country and the locally crime boss is an ex  communicated Omish man. That is it in a wrap[ with out giving out to much info.  Do as I did and rent the first episode form amazon and determine if this is your type of show.",1423440000,,1099,4.041666666666667

You just have to appreciate it for what it is--a really dark comedy with moments of sadness, insanity and brevity mixed in.  I especially enjoyed the performances of the lead male playing the semi tortured soul---he is likeable enough to make you want to root for him.  His Asian friend adds a curt humor to an otherwise downward spiral-ish and at times despicable story line.  I also enjoy Faison in this part he is playing on this show as the bar owner.  The only real annoyance to watching this show is huge amounts of unnecessary sex scenes that add nothing to the story. I lost count of how many.",1421884800,2,735,4.4222222222222225

6299730,4,B00IV3FLO8,A very unique series. Kai Procter is the most interesting villain to come along in a long time. There are new characters introduced and sadly some characters we've come to know are gone after the second season's end. I don't like the way one storyline is heading with Kai and Rebecca.  The series dragged a bit. There is a new character Chaydon who will have a greater role in series 3 who is down right scary. Had he served time in the same prison with the Albino the Albino would have been his property. Some secrets are reviled giving a new story line for Season 3.

6299733,5,B00IV3FLO8,"I had to give this 5 stars because I love this show!! There is also a good amount of extra features! The only thing that doesn't deserve 5 stars is the packaging of the discs. When you open the case, there are two plastic holders - one for Disc 1, the other side for Disc 2 and the other plastic holder is the same way with Disc 3 and then 4. It resembles older season sets except the plastic used must be very cheap...it broke just by taking a disc out. I tried fixing the middle piece where the plastic somehow joins together but it wouldn't stay. If I were to open it without knowing, the discs would fall out. I put them in my own cases. Not a big deal - I just have been noticing how the quality of all products sold, not just on Amazon, have gotten cheaper looking or smaller sized as the years go by.

6299736,5,B00IV3FLO8,Great show and Season 2 was action packed.,1420416000,,42,4.375
6299737,5,B00IV3FLO8,"WARNING...this contains some season 1 spoilers and hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen the first season proceed at your own risk.

It can certainly be argued the second season of Banshee was even better than the first.  At the very least they are on par with each other.  In part because much of season 2 is a continuation of what was set up in season 1, and also fleshes out the story lines from season 1.  Given that they only have 10 episodes to pack everything in, a lot happens.

Season 2 has the main storylines of Anna/Lucas/Rabbit, and the ancillary stories involving Anna's/Carrie's family.  Then you have Kai Proctor vs Lucas and Proctor vs Longfellow.  Intertwined in those story lines is the insertion of Rebecca, who like Proctor, was excommunicated from the Amish community.  The main stories intersect at times, are independent at others, and sometimes intersect with the ancillary storylines involving the other characters, including a visit from the real Lucas Hood's son, who discovered at the very end of season 1 that his father was being impersonated.

Like in season 1, there is a lot of violence and sex.  I would not really call either completely gratuitous (with some exceptions).  In fact part of what was weaved into the story is Hood's desire to leave the violence that seems to follow him behind.  But he always seems to keep getting dragged back in.  All the characters walk the line between good and bad, even more this season than in season 1.  In fact, Brock is about the only character this season that stays on the ""good"" side of the line.  And while he does not trust Hood, he is becoming more accepting of the fact that he is the least bad of the bad guys, and wants to do good.

Much of the season is spent fleshing out the Rabbit/Lucas/Anna storyline.  We get a lot of back story (told through flashbacks)  about what lead up to the events of Lucas going to prison, Anna becoming Carrie and ending up in Banshee.  It also sets up season 3 with more Proctor/Hood conflict and Introducing a new bad guy, Chayton Littlestone, a gangster on the Reservation.

The season contained many great guest starring characters, among them Zeljko Ivanek as FBI agent Jim Racine who has been trying to bust Rabbit for years, and the stunning Odette Annable (of House and Cloverfield) who is Alex Longshadow's dangerous sister Nola (who made a brief appearance at the end of season 1.  The season again boasted great writing and acting.  Antony Starr and Ivana Milievi have great chemistry as the series leads when they do have scenes together, but both do a great job with their characters even in the story lines where they are not together.  Hoon Lee as Job continues the steal the show in almost every scene he is in.  The best was his ""introduction"" shown in a flash back in the last episode.

For those who get the actual blu rays, the series looks and sounds great.  There is audio commentary on about 4 episodes.  A couple episodes with twitter commentary from the cast and crew, deleted scenes for nearly every episode, a few behind the episode featurettes, and deconstructing the title sequence features for every episode.  There is also a 45 min (or so) Banshee Origins series that show some of the events leading up to season 1.  All in all there is a lot for people who like to go through the bonus material.

Banshee is definitely not a show for everyone.  It is very violent and sexual, but everything has a purpose.  It is certainly not what you would think of late night Cinemax fare, although there are definitely some Skinemax lite moments in the show.  That aside it is a very well acted, well written show with interesting and compelling characters.  Like a lot of the TV series (especially the cable series) it benefits from having a shorter season.  It packs a lot into 10 episodes, yet still gives all the characters something to do, and just as with season 1, by the time I got through all 10 episodes I was left wanting more, and excited to see where season 3 goes.  I highly recommend it!",1420329600,3,4068,4.6

6299759,5,B00IV3FLO8,"Banshee is my guilty pleasure. Yes, it's gratuitous and hyper violent and sexual. But underneath all that it has some of the best and most complex characters currently on TV period. Combined with a unique setting and storytelling that focuses on the overall story arc, this all comes together for a thrill of a ride. It might be the in your face, gritty action that keeps you on the edge of your seat--but its the nuanced and original storytelling that manages to make very real world emotional connections (despite the admittedly fantastical/not realistic at all backdrop) that actually keeps you coming back to the show.

I wasn't quite sure how they would top season one, but was pleasantly surprised at just how well season 2 flowed from season 1's storyline. The Rabbit plot line comes to a satisfying conclusion, and a whole new world of other drama is set into motion mainly dealing with the local Native tribe and Proctor (the unscrupulous ex-Amish mafia boss). Banshee also didn't fall into the trap that a lot of sequels have of trying to make everything bigger and louder. Instead, they keep the focus on the characters, and spend time fleshing out the interpersonal stories which makes you care that much more about the action/violence as you genuinely care about the people involved.

On a last note, Banshee could easily be criticized for objectifying women. You will see lots of boobs etc. However, unlike shows like GOT or Da Vinci's Demons, Banshee is pretty equal opportunity on that front which is actually sort of refreshing. Not to mention, Banshee has not one, but three main female characters who are ridiculously complex and bada** and who all get enough screentime to be far more than just a pretty face (which is a lot more than most more conventional TV shows have going for them in terms of representation). As a woman, I'm actually pretty thrilled with the Banshee ladies' stories which is incredibly rare for hardcore action shows or movies.",1417478400,42,1971,4.863095238095238
