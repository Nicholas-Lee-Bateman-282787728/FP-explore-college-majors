5847289,5,B00DQEHKZ0,This is really funny and I can't wait for the second season.  Christopher Guest continues to entertain and amuse.  Worth the money Spent.,1383868800,3,137,4.913043478260869
5847290,5,B00DQEHKZ0,"""Family Tree"" is absolutely hilarious.  Every episode is superb, with Chris O'Dowd heading a terrific ensemble cast.  For the millions of us who are dabbling in our own ancestry searches, who better to lampoon the process, and the inherent anticipations of ancient greatness, than comic genius Christopher Guest?  The first season takes O'Dowd's character, Tom, through the ups and downs of genealogy tracking, meeting so called experts and distant cousins with family secrets.  Tom goes from the UK to America, as he discovers one of his Grandfathers did the opposite of most people, and actually moved from America to the UK.  ""Idiot"" is the term Tom ascribes to this ancester for that miscalculation.  As he explores his possible Native American roots, he meets his U.S relations.  All are a funny collection of oddballs, with Guest, himself appearing as one of the oddest.  So, so funny.  But, one of the best characters throughout the season, is Tom's sister, Bea, a ventriloquist, who relates largely to people through her monkey hand puppet.  His name is ""Monk"" or just ""Monkey"" and everyone involved, treats him as part of the family.  He says all the deranged and nasty stuff, she is thinking but can't say.  OMG.  Side splitting hilarity!  I cannot wait for Season 2 of ""Family Tree,"" and is it too much to ask, that Guest maybe give Bea and ""Monk"" their own show?  Great stuff!

5847295,5,B00DQEHKZ0,"This is a genial mockumentary from Christopher Guest.  He writes, directs, composes the music and appears in several of the American episodes.  He also draws on both his English and American heritage.

The series (as yet unrenewed, unfortunately) features Chris ODowd as Tom Chadwick, a raised-in-Ireland Londoner who seeks to flesh out his family tree.  Sometimes accompanied by his zany friend Pete and sometimes by his sister Bea, his quest takes him as far north as Derbyshire and as far west as Los Angeles.  Bea (Nina Conti) speaks through a hand puppet monkey (Monk) who is utterly hilarious.  Their father is played by Michael McKean, a devotee of British sitcoms who can identify an episode after seeing 2-3 second clips.  Fred Willard plays the gay neighbor of Toms Glendale, CA relative, played by Ed Begley, Jr.  Guest appears as a North Carolina relative (echoing his character in Best in Show).

The tone throughout is bittersweet/comic, with wonderful British humor and broader American comedy.  Vignettes include a trip to an Indian souvenir shop in the Mojave Desert, the reenactment of a civil war battle in which the confederate general is a hairdresser in everyday life and a pantomime horse race in which a two-legged giraffe and two-legged panda cheat their way ahead of Tom and Petes four-legged horse.  The latter has the flavor of a Python routine.

In the first season there are eight 30-minute episodes.  This is a beautiful and entertaining way to spend an evening, with the minutes flying by and Guests genius everywhere in evidence.",1431561600,2,1562,5.031128404669261

He's looking for information on his family, which takes him from the UK to the USA, and he meets lots of strange people along the way. It's very low key, and it's worth watching more than once just to see what you missed the first time through.

5847307,5,B00DQEHKZ0,"I am a big Christopher Guest fan, this kind of humor JUST my cup of tea, celebrating people's good faith efforts to figure things out and roll with life's punches, while cutting each other considerable slack with our respective lunacies. There are SO many priceless characters here, I really think this is the most incisive, inspired work of Guest's career (and the most subtle, not a ""mockumentary"" per se, the characterizations more finely drawn, the characters well-meaning, caring and lovable- quite real).  As a bi-cultural sort, Guest is ideally qualified/situated to gently lampoon both Americans and Brits, lots of cross-cultural humor to explore.

For some reason I got the impression and couldn't shake it that Monk/Monkey, the puppet (adept at online chat among other things!) is channeling Joan Plowright!  What a great character, and choice lines, along with so many others: lackadaisical, tres HIP Native Americans, dutiful Civil War re-enactors- actually, EVERYONE interesting and revealing of human nature.  And even tongue-in-cheek programs the characters watch on their OWN TVs (referencing Star Trek, Dr. Who, Benny Hill, Sherlock Holmes, and more)- circular self-reference elevated to an art form, like an Escher painting, brilliant, revealing, priceless.  I'm so disappointed HBO canceled the series, for one thing, Guest does an absolutely SPLENDID job of lovingly parodying the British- more incisive, canny characterizations of what makes them both hilarious and dear I've never seen.

But everyone is great, Brits and Yanks alike, from Ed Begley Jr.'s earnest, deadpan delivery as a conspiracy theorist seeing patterns everywhere, to Tom's ever-crude but eternally plucky best friend Pete, to Tom himself, the wonderful Irish actor Chris O'Dowd (who played Kristen Wiig's love interest in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridesmaids/dp/B005O716IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridesmaids</a>).  Here's he's the glue that ties it all together, seeking his roots, excited about possibilities, endlessly patient, with hidden depths and surprising facets- Everyman, and we're rooting for him.  I watched the entire season in one sitting, I want MORE. Twould be nice if HBO brought it back.  If we're lucky perhaps Guest & Co. are working behind the scenes to bring the show to another venue.",1404518400,,2353,5.75792507204611
5847308,1,B00DQEHKZ0,Great show. But why does the US charge over $20 for this region 1 product when the region 2 DVD for this show is available through AmazonUK for 6.09 (that's about $10).,1403481600,2,168,4.28125

5847312,5,B00DQEHKZ0,"What a pity that HBO reportedly cancelled this series after just one season!!!  I thought they had more insight and integrity than that, but apparently not...

Because here Christopher Guest and his troupe of brilliant improvisers are back at the top of their game after the disappointing film ""For Your Consideration.""

Tree is the story of a young Brit trying to find himself (after losing his job and girlfriend) by rediscovering his family roots.

Hilarity ensues, as his journey to the past introduces him to an amazing array of situations and characters both in England and America.

If you ever enjoyed Guest and company's best previous work, notably the films ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show,"" and ""A Mighty Wind,"" trust me when I say that this series is absolutely on the same level with those mockumentary masterpieces.

As always, Fred Willard, Michael McKean, Ed Begley Jr., Jim Piddock, Bob Balaban, and others show up to take ad libbing to new heights, but here they are also joined by the charming Chris O'Dowd as the young man in search of himself, as well as the remarkable Nina Conti as his sister Bea, who communicates with the use of a monkey hand puppet named, well, Monkey.

I think Conti may be the best ventriloquist I've seen since Edgar Bergen or Paul Winchell!  Plus she can ad lib with the best of them -- and she has great legs!!!

Some of the highlights of this series include the dopey formulaic Britcoms the Michael McKean character finds so hilarious; a race of humans in animal costumes; Bea and Monkey's ruinous performance at a wedding; a Civil War battle reenactment; and much more.

I also highly recommmend that you purchase this DVD set, which includes a number of bonus scenes that are ALL killer with NO filler.

Will another cable network step in to rescue this series?  One can only hope -- I want to see if Tom Chadwick stays with his new sweetie in America or returns to Britain with his buddy Pete, Bea, and Monkey...",1400457600,2,1969,4.708454810495627
5847313,5,B00DQEHKZ0,"Loved it, want more.  I could watch Chris O'Dowd all day long in anything he does!  He's an underrated master of the understated and ridiculous.  Great premise, weird characters, worth watching!",1399593600,,194,5.193548387096774

5847315,5,B00DQEHKZ0,"Tracing your family tree seems to be addictive. As soon as my mother got a taste, she spent every spare moment she had looking up obscure medieval ancestors.

One can only wonder if Christopher Guest had a similar experience that inspired ""Family Tree,"" which proves that Guest can make almost anything funny. Half quirky dramedy and half mockumentary, this smart little show follows a young man who gets his life together as he learns the stories of his ancestors... who, it turns out, are almost as weird as the kith and kin he has now.

Tom Chadwick (Chris O'Dowd) is depressed after the double-punch of being dumped by his job and his girlfriend, so the death of a great-aunt doesn't make much of an impression. But in the box of things she left him, he finds an unnamed picture of a Victorian officer, which he believes may be one of his ancestors. He's accompanied by his insane friend Pete (Tom Bennett) and sometimes his even more insane sister Bea (Nina Conti) who can only communicate via a foul-mouthed monkey hand puppet.

With the picture as his starting point, he begins to investigate the stories of his ancestors -- which involve the theatre, the Olympics, cousins on a farm, betrayal, hot-air balloons, sex and pantomime horses. Tom's quest even takes him over to the US, where he searches for a possible Native American ancestress, a guy who apparently fought for both sides in the Civil War, and some eccentric cousins from L.A.

Anyone familiar with Christopher Guest's movies will probably feel right at home in ""Family Tree."" It has Guest's usual approach -- a mockumentary where everybody acts and speaks in a very serious manner... except that they often do or say bizarre, hilarious things (Luba's speech about a strange virginity-and-egg-based Moldavian festival), or fail to understand what is going on around them (Pete and Tom do not understand that Great-Aunt Victoria was a lesbian).

It doesn't sound like there's much substance to the plot here, but Guest keeps things moving with a steady stream of quietly quirky stuff. It helps that much of the humor is subtle rather than obvious (Tom remarks that he has ""a good six months of wallowing left"" about his breakup and firing). The show loses some momentum when Tom travels to L.A., but things do pick up when he continues the quest for the story of his American cousins.

It also shows the subtler side of Chris O'Dowd's comic talents, and his grungy sad-eyed charm. Tom is the straight man in all this madness, and has a quietly broken quality that makes him instantly endearing. But he ultimately finds inspiration from the struggles of his ancestors, and the family-tree-tracing gives him something to focus on rather than his unemployed-and-single status. Also, O'Dowd is a LOT taller than I thought he was.

And as the straight man, he's surrounded by weirdos, played by Conti, McKean, Jim Piddock, Guest himself, Ed Begley Jr., Matt Griesser. These actors are what keep the slight plot conceit afloat -- without scenes like Bea and Monk bombing horribly at a wedding, the comedy would seem kind of one-note.

Sadly, HBO cancelled ""Family Tree,"" presumably because it specializes in quirk rather than self-indulgence. But the one season is a charming, characteristically Guestian little adventure in genealogy. Fun and adorable.",1396483200,4,3317,4.942549371633752

Tom, the main character, has one whacky family. His genealogical search is funnier than most. It is a fun show, although I would rate it at least R. I couldn't wait to find out what happens next.
