8476092,5,B005JXLP4I,"I hesitated to buy this series, as it was not readily available in the U.S. Purchased Season 1, as preview to whether I'd invest in succeeding series. Comfortable and enjoyable viewing. Better than expected. I likely will invest in subsequent series, if available. Rated 5 stars.",1461196800,,279,5.086956521739131
8476093,4,B005JXLP4I,"A light and entertaining series set in Yorkshire in the early 1960's, the episodes provide insight into the development of the National Health system in a semi-rural hospital.  The soundtrack has a lot of songs from the mid-60's, pre-Beatles.  Two of the actors are well known to all of us, Ian Carmichael, who played Lord Peter Wimsey, and Julian Ovenden, who played Foyle's RAF son in the series, Foyle's War.",1405728000,3,411,4.857142857142857
8476094,3,B005JXLP4I,"I only gave this a three-star rating, because I was disappointed with the morality in it. Even though they did not actually show anything immoral, it was implicated that the main actor and his girlfriend ( the young nurse ) had had an affair. I had heard from different reviews on this product, that you could not find a more decent movie. I beg to differ. Just because sex was implicated rather than shown, does not make this a decent, Christian movie in my eyes or in God's eyes. Everything else in the movie was ok (with the exception of showing way too much of the two maintenance guys and Mr. Greengrass ). I would have enjoyed this movie if not for the immorality. The immorality just ruins it.",1390435200,,700,4.434108527131783
