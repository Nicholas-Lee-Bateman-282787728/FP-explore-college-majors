4525531,3,B0051PLR9C,"Holly Rowe (Viva Bianca) a call girl has saved up enough money for retirement. She is getting ready to go to Paris. Michael, one of Holly's Johns is a married man who has an unhealthy attachment for her. He wants to run away with her to Paris.

Meanwhile Shay (Hanna Mangan Lawrence) is the new girl on the block making money by giving hand jobs to old men while talking dirty (I couldn't believe that is what old men always request from young girls.) Shay doesn't have a pimp to ""protect"" her. She has been stepping on the other girl's territory without paying her dues.

Holly has a big score and needs a second girl. All the other girls are busy. That is when she runs into Shay (literally) in the street. She takes Shay under her wing. Of course nothing goes as planned and the working girls witness a murder. They are on the run because...? Prostitutes make for credible witnesses and always run to the cops when they see a crime. The movie becomes a game of cat and mouse with some minor unoriginal twists.

What we learned is that all Johns are creepy men who want kinky sex, all prostitutes are reluctant victims, and cars in Australia don't have front air bags. The acting was good. The script was bland.

Nudity (male and female, Viva Bianca,Hanna Mangan Lawrence, Belinda McClory), sex, f-bomb.",1325289600,39,1305,4.540425531914893
4525532,1,B0051PLR9C,"I thought this movie was going to be a serious hardcore movie delving deep into the life of a prostitute. This movie barely scratches the surface of what these women go through on a daily bases. The movie wasn't even explicit sexually or really nudity wise,I'm sorry maybe my expectation were to high but for me this movie was boring as hell and didn't make sense. If you want to see a movie that truly puts you in the life & world of a prostitute and is very explicit violence,nudity,and sexually wise then you need to rent or buy the movie !BAISE MOI!",1308700800,11,553,4.378640776699029
4525533,4,B0051PLR9C,"Just saw this on Pay Per View. Tremendously exciting, very realistic about a prostitute's life, and -- best of all -- there's real suspense. The audience is never certain who, if anyone, will survive. Some people complain that characters in movies of this sort are not likable, but I think it's made very clear that the two lead women are in a profession that leaves them no time to be likable. Both of them do a tremendous job.

The action came a little thick and fast. I don't think I'd have accepted so many coincidences if they had all turned out in the heroines' favor. And the young prostitute was written both a little too naive and a little too generous. That's worth taking off a star, but I haven't seen such a tense movie in years, nor one that worked so well. Compared with this the typical Hollywood action flick is pure comic book.",1308355200,36,845,4.451612903225806

4525537,4,B0051PLR9C,"This was a pretty decent erotic thriller, with some rather explicit scenes by American standards. Given how much America has been overrun by bible thumping lunatics in our political arena, this movie would be way too much for Fox News imbeciles to process and digest. That said, this movie would be unsuitable for a sizable chunk of America's viewing audience.",1400544000,,360,5.016666666666667
4525538,4,B0051PLR9C,the story lead had an interesting twist to it's story line. After watching I think for people that have an interest in the dark side of crime and how individuals get caught in unique but dangerous situations will find this interesting. Story line a little convoluted but does keep a persons interest.,1399766400,,300,4.788461538461538
4525539,3,B0051PLR9C,"Despite the cover, this is not soft core pornography.  It's actually kind of a coming of age movie mixed with about six wannabe B movies.  Don't get me wrong, I love B movies, and I managed to get through it and actually stay interested in what happens.  But your results may vary. There's a lot of gory fights. Very little sex.  What sex there is, is either off camera or soft-focused to the point of unrecognizable. However, the plot moves right along, and is chock-a-block with some of the funniest unintended humor I've seen in a while. Worth a watch, but if it doesn't catch your funny bone in the first 15?

4525545,2,B0051PLR9C,"Simple plot of running away from trouble for being in the wrong place at the wromng time.  But a bit of background play into the plot for each of the main characters would have made the transitions into their current predicament a bit more understandable or appreciated.  Cinematography is not bad with good scenes occassionally.  Good intriguing part in discovering of the ""bad"" cop(s).

4525546,4,B0051PLR9C,"This is a bitter sweat movie.  Holly is a high class call girl, Shay is a struggling teenager on the streets after running away from home.  It is never fully explained why Shay ran away but it is inevitable for her to turn to what every young girl in her position have to do to make money, and using the only thing she has, her body.  They don't meet until half way through the movie but the roller coaster ride they go on as Holly tries to protect Shay and stay alive was exciting. I had hopped that the movie would end with Holly achieving her dream and maybe take Shay with her.  But that didn't happen.  I purchased this movie because I thought it would be in French, but it was still a very good movie.",1396742400,,707,4.131386861313868
4525547,1,B0051PLR9C,"So many Aussie movies and TV dramas have an atmosphere about them that I find uncomfortable. I don't mind being shocked or upset by a movie that covers shocking or upsetting subjects. That's the sign of a skilled movie maker. No, the discomfort in many Aussie films comes from being treated like an idiot that has to have the characters of the main players spelled out childrens pantomime style. That's what seems so flat to me about 'X' - the evil characters (and that's pretty much everyone bar two or three) are so ridiculously rotten they should have been wearing black capes and wax mustaches with bread rolls being thrown at them.

Shay Ryan - played by Hanna Mangan Lawrence is simply way too pretty and 'fashion model' perfect to be believable as a street hooker having to service dirty old men for a few bucks a go. Her clients and everyone connected with her trade are all 100 percent horrible. Given that this is obviously a movie aimed at adults, I would have thought the audience could be credited with being able to handle some more realistic character portrayals.

It is also cliche ridden. There is a scene right at the end of the movie which is so corny I felt embarrassed on their behalf but it serves to sum up the whole thing. I'm guessing this production was made as a vehicle to push a message and perhaps the funding was dependent on that.",1396569600,,1362,4.532520325203252

From there we are shown the wildly divergent paths of two prostitutes named Holly (Viva Bianca) and Shay (Hannah Mangan-Lawrence). Holly is a high-priced call-girl, while Shay is a common street walker. One of Holly's johns, a married ""family man"" named Michael, wants her to run away w/ him. Unfortunately for Holly, Michael happens to be a violent, sadistic slug. She just wants to get out of town, and never look back. Holly's journey begins after her roommate slips and falls in the shower, and Holly can't get into her apartment. She hops in a cab and along the way, almost runs over Shay, who has been beaten up and robbed. It just so happens that Holly needs a second girl for a scheduled threesome. It pays well, so Shay takes her up on it. This client is not just another pervert. He's a criminal in trouble w/ his boss, who shows up unexpectedly. While the girls are hiding in the bathroom, the john is executed in the hotel room! Now, Holly and Shay must run for their lives from this murdering madman! They split up, and the killer tracks Holly down. She proves to be far more formidable than he had expected! Holly's no pushover! However, she IS in very serious trouble. The man kidnaps Holly and forces her to help him to find Shay. Will either one of these women survive the night? X is less of an erotic thriller, and more of a thriller w/ prostitutes as its main characters. It's a head-first dive into the darker side of life. Not at all what I had thought it would be, and that's a good thing...",1392076800,,1609,4.420875420875421

4525628,2,B0051PLR9C,"I can't say because I'm still trying to figure it out. I only watched this movie for one reason and that's Viva Bianca other than that I probably would have never bothered to even press play. Much for the same reasons I couldn't stand The Watchmen this movie also likes throwing some nude guys junk in your face every opportunity they get. I think it's the first time I wished the Camera man would pan up but this films tries to be edgy and surreal. You are rewarded though ever so often with a glimpse of Viva Bianca and by glimpse I mean a masterful 10seconds and then about 5 minutes of watching some guys junk dangling. I'll be honest I knew I was going to hate this movie about 5 minutes into the opening scene.

There's been a couple life of a prostitute or movies involving prostitutes I think I watched but they were all foreign. They were also equally as boring with little action but, I take that back there's a bit more suspense in this movie that makes it somewhat engaging more or less. The problem is the ""Heavy Rain"" camera angles. Just random closeups and awkward filming angles that make you wonder just what the director was going for. It's hard to describe without watching for yourself to understand.

I don't know what it is about these sex movies that always seem to have some kind of deviant super perverted guy that's a cross between Ted Bundy and Mark Walhberg in ""Fear"". One look at the guy and you can tell he's crazy but the girl always seems to hookup with him anyway. I mean, it's a trend I noticed in just about all of these movies.

What is this movie about? Well, it does have a plot 2 Prostitutes one who's career is ending and another who's is just beginning meet and find themselves fleeing for their lives and that's about all that is clear in this film. If I could some this movie up in one word it be ""Raunchy"". If I wanted to watch a porno I'd watch one. If I wanted to watch a movie I'd watch one. These one can't seem to figure out which end of the stick it's trying to be so it all comes off as something you'd rather not sit down to waste your time viewing.",1355097600,5,2101,4.260651629072682

4525630,4,B0051PLR9C,"X is an incredibly slow-moving movie in the beginning but by all means, stick with it and you'll be rewarded for your efforts.  You see the beginning is all about a young prostitute roaming the streets and doing all the dirty deeds that she has to do just to make some money and survive in a harsh, compassionless city infested with creepy sex-craved men.  This of course means having to get inside vehicles with men who have the money to do whatever their perverted hearts desire.  It's a really gross business and I'm glad I never have to associate with anything related to this in reality.

Anyway, the girl who plays the prostitute is really cute and as we discover a VERY good actress.  It's about this young girl eventually becoming friends with another prostitute that encounters her to participate in a sex act where she can make 300 bucks.  The girl reluctantly agrees after some pretty persistent convincing on the other prostitutes part.  Well from here, *now* the storyline actually gets going!

While the two prostitutes are partying and having sex with the man at the apartment, a mysterious phone call alarms the man to the point that he tells the two girls to quickly hide in the back bathroom of the hotel.  When this mysterious man arrives and enters the room... he commits a murder and of course, he soon realizes that there's witnesses hiding in the back room, so the two girls take off running.  The chase is now on!  They have to take off running and hiding from this man whenever he gets near.

This movie actually serves another purpose- it shows to me that if your life ever gets to the point that you have to rely on having sex just to make some money, well, I was actually feeling really sorry for the prostitute and the many problems she was forced to face just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  But this is by no means a drama- well it is in a few spots I suppose, but it's mainly a suspense.  The way the movie ends however, is pretty fascinating.  The final line of the movie puts the icing on the cake because it's so appropriate.  The story is pretty elaborate how it gets to that point just to deliver that one fantastic line and of course I don't wanna spoil what's said, but it's totally worth it.  The right ending indeed.

I recommend X.  Not the greatest story in the world, but you really feel for the girl and want her to survive and overcome the obstacles that stand in her way.",1342656000,,2434,4.441441441441442
4525631,4,B0051PLR9C,"One problem with film synopses in the USA is that any movie in which there is an exposure of female sexual bodily parts is automatically called ""erotic"" as if eroticism resides only in the quick flash of a breast or a buttock. So let's get that out of the way at the beginning: there is no way, by any stretch of the imagination that anyone living outside the USA, Iran, Indonesia, or Saudi Arabia would find this movie in any way erotic, arousing, or titillating.

This is a gritty movie about a young girl who runs away from what we presume was an abusive relationship with a foster-father. Certainly, from the flashback we see of her drug-addicted and drug-raddled mother, it's unlikely to have been a loving and supporting family environment. She goes to Sydney with the intention of supporting herself through prostitution, though it's clear that she doesn't have much of a clue about what actual prostitution involves. Peniless and destitute, she takes what she can get - and it's not much. This seventeen-year-old is insufficiently hardened, so she's continually on the receiving end of the brutality of others, even those whom she helps. She ends up witnessing a murder committed by a crooked cop and that trope defines the main plot of the movie and provides its action sequences. But the over-riding theme is the way this waif stumbles through the dystopia of the Sydney underworld in which small lives become even smaller as a result of stunted personalities, drug addiction, mindless violence and world-views that could fit into something rather less capacious than a thimble. This is the world of the brain-dead, the imaginationless, the hopeless, the living dead. And the film captures this world very capably, with an awful sense of claustrophobia. The heroine has run away from small-town Australia but the gutters of Sydney are even more confining than what she fled from.

As a parent, I found this film to be very difficult to watch. It's impossible not to sympathize with the heroine and therefore impossible not to yearn to rescue her. But of course it's a movie so all we can do is watch. In real life, thousands of young girls like this go under every year, drowned in the swamp that is the dregs of human behavior. This is one movie that captures the brutal desperation of such places unflinchingly, and that's what matters in the end, not the contrived suspense of the chase theme or the fact that there are nipples on-screen for a few seconds.",1333843200,24,2469,4.807058823529411
4525632,4,B0051PLR9C,"The scene is Sydney and a high class `call girl' is on her way to do an action `life class' with a Jude Law look a likie in front of Sydney's well to do ladies. They sit in a circle sipping champagne while our heroic duo `get it on' in a sort of upper class `dogging' class; and who said the Australians have no culture?

This `courtesan' is Holly Rowe (Viva Bianca), she has decided to quit the profession and retire to Paris. Problem is she hasn't told her eerily controlling `boyfriend' who wants to leave his family to be with her - oops. She also has to `work' right up to the time to get on the flight. We also have the story of seventeen year old, runaway Shay Ryan (Hannah Mangan-Lawrence) she is penniless and is going to start at the bottom of the street walking trade by giving hand relief for a few dollars.

Fate throws the two women together and they end up in a situation that they can not control. What happens next is a full on ride through the very sleazy under belly of Sydney, including drug abuse, flesh pots and corrupt coppers. There is a fair amount of nudity and violence along the way too.

Director Jon Hewitt has done a reasonable job of getting fairly good performances from the cast, there are some that could have been improved, but this is a fast paced thriller that tries very hard not to pull its punches. That is where it has real strength and not in the character development and I must say I thought it was very good indeed.

There are a couple of plot holes in this 89 minute action fest, but they are so minor that they can be overlooked for the sake of entertainment, and entertaining this really is. Another great film from Australia that deals with crime, not as good as `Animal Kingdom' but a very close run thing.",1331856000,2,1757,4.315151515151515
4525633,5,B0051PLR9C,"This movie was actually very good. I would imagine that the reason the movie is a little difficult to acquire is because it is a foreign movie. There are no, to my knowledge, porn stars in this movie. As far as I know, Viva Bianca is a serious actress, on both the screen and stage. It sounds as if there are two people who were expecting something along the lines of porn. This is not that movie, and rating it based on that expectation is unfair to all involved with the making of X. I rented the movie because of the leading actress, loved it, and then bought it. I just think it is bad form to give a low rating for something because it attempts to be a legitimate movie and not porn. The action is non-stop once things begin to go bad for the leading characters, and it was handled very well. If you love Viva Bianca in Spartacus, as I do, you will get to see a great performance with a wider range of emotion than she portrays as Ilithyia. There are a couple twists that add to the entertainment factor, as well as a hard look at the life of girls and women on the streets from different points of view. Prostitution is not glamorized, because while you get to see the high level the leading character rises to, you also get to see the play of emotion that hints that what is seen on the surface is just an act.

She's just turning 30 today, been selling her body for half her life, and her plan is to get away now, move to Paris and start another life.
Then there's Shay (Hanna Mangan Lawrence, incredibly fetching in shorts and a grey t-shirt cut oh so high) who's new to the game and starting out at rock bottom: working the street, getting in fights with other street walkers over turf, giving hand jobs with dirty talk in moving cars.
Then Holly's colleague has a fateful shower accident and she's out on the street, looking for a brunette for a threesome, and who should the taxi run into but Shay. Everything runs smoothly (and quite graphically), when all of a sudden the john, Willie (Hazzm Shamas) gets a call. It's not long before they're witnessing Willie getting murdered by a corrupt cop, Bennett (Stephen Phillips).
