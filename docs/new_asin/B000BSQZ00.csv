2439524,4,B000BSQZ00,Is this $199 amount for MArimar is the complete telenovela of Thalia uncut?cause I want the full footage not the edited one. One more thing I'd like to ask if this have a subtitle in English and how many hours is the screening time? Thanks,1133308800,,239,4.333333333333333
2439525,1,B000BSQZ00,"I thought I'd surprise my wife with this for her birthday.  She grew up watching Mari Mar, and she's been translating it for me whenever we watch it.

Yes it's subtitled in English, but they cut 80% of the series in this ripoff collection.  To top it off, they dub over original music with cheap MIDI synthesizer music.  It sounds like lousy karaoke music!!

DO NOT BUY!! The reviews should have been warning enough.  Thoroughly disappointed.",1398297600,7,442,4.75

2439530,3,B000BSQZ00,"This is a shortened version of the original. For people who have previously seen Mari Mar, they will most likely be disappointed. For those who have not watched it before, you will be able to follow the main plot, but a lot of smaller events and lesser characters been cut out, and it can be a bit confusing. Scenes are sometimes cut abruptly ruining the fluidity of the story. It's cheap, but I'd rather just look for the whole, original version.

Esta es una version corta de la novela original. Para los que ya vieron la novela antes, puede que se desepcionen un poco. Para los que no han visto Mari Mar, si se puede seguir la historia, pero muchos de los eventos pequeos y personajes menores han sido recortados, y puede ser confuso. Algunas de las escenas se cortan de repente y arruina el flujo de la novela. Esta barata, pero prefiero buscar la version completa y original.",1366848000,2,880,4.534591194968553

2439538,3,B000BSQZ00,"I thought I was going crazy because the story line of the telenovela, Mari Mar, lacked continuity.  I thought I was missing a disk somewhere. After reading other reviews, I realized ""I am not the problem."" It is because the novela was chopped in all places.  I could not understand why something was happening to the story and how the characters got there. I thought perhaps my DVD player skipped scenes.

One of the most annoying things about the DVD telenovela is that the background music is too loud that I can hardly hear the characters speaking.  It is not the music I bought the telenovela for. I wanted to hear the spoken Spanish!  I wanted to understand the dialog and not have to deal with the music. I believe the intention was to ""set up"" the scene for some drama but instead it just offends the sensibilities of the viewer.",1291075200,9,836,4.509933774834437
2439539,3,B000BSQZ00,"El Dvd es Hermoso, la Presentacion, el Diseo, la Portada y demas. En cuanto a la Edicion, tiene la Entrada Original y los Creditos Finales, aunque la musicalizacion es otra, encima de la Original, lo que hace aveces imposible escuchar las voces de los personajes o dialogos, pero en algunas escenas no en todas. Por otra parte, el resumen esta hecho mas o menos, si bien mantiene la coherencia, hay muchas, pero muchas escenas que faltan, como cuando Marimar aparece vestida de Sirena en el Mar, en un sueo de Sergio, cuando Marimar se pelea con Angelica en la Hacienda, cuando Angelica humilla a Marimar haciendole sacar la pulsera del fango, cuando le pide a Nicandro que mate a los Abuelos, cuando los abuelitos mueren quemados, cuando Marimar se despide de ellos en el Cementerio, muchas partes de cuando Marimar se va a Mexico, cuando Renato mata a Nicandro para defender a Angelica, todo lo relacionado con el Hermano de Nicandro, y sobre todo el Final de Angelica, cuando queda quemada despues del Accidente y muere a los pocos dias sin haberse arrepentido de nada, y le pide a Renato que le prenda fuego a la Hacienda con Marimar adentro, no se ve nada de eso, lo cual me parece super importante, porque es el castigo de la Villana, y no tendrian que haberlo sacado, porque son escenas esenciales para la historia, lo demas esta bien. Otra cosa a destacar es que le dan mucha importancia al comienzo, dejan mucho de los inicios y sacan muchas escenas importantes a lo largo de la Telenovela lo cual aveces puede resultar algo confusa sobretodo para quien no la vio en television de manera completa. Y una cosa que me molesto mucho fue que el Dvd incluye 3 Discos, y el numero 3 al igual que los demas son de doble cara, de 2 lados, y el disco 3 solo tiene un lado disponible, el otro esta vacio, lo podrian haber aprovechado para poner al menos 2 Hs mas de Resumenes o Extras, como Entrevistas, Bloopers,Detras de Camaras, Fotos etc... pero no contiene nada de eso y fue una Exelente Telenovela, bien lo merecia.",1287705600,2,2020,4.598337950138504

2439546,1,B000BSQZ00,"MariMar one of Thalia and Televisa's biggest hits finally makes it to DVD. Was it worth the wait? NO. For those of you who fell in love with this series when it first hit the air waves in 1994 you will be in for quite a shock. This is a butchered version of the original story.

It really makes no sense in releasing these famous Televisa telenovelas if they are not going to be faithful to their original presentation.

The butchering done to these episodes in inexcusable! The storyline makes absolutely no sense now as it jumps to plot point to plot point. It's laughable. Actually it's infuriating.

Granted we're not talking about ""Gone With the Wind"" here, but still MariMar, Maria La Del Barrio, Maria Mercedes and Rosalinda are four of Thalia's biggest and best in the telenovela genre and have garnered fans on an international level.

This past year alone there was a very successful remake of this series in the Philippines, which proves how popular and far reaching these programs are.

It's an injustice that just to make a quick buck these shows are being rushed out on DVD in such a careless fashion.

People who have never seen these shows to begin with are going to think this is what was originally aired on television. It is not. Not by a long shot.

Televisa needs to get their act together and release these shows in their COMPLETE, UNEDITED ORIGINAL VERSIONS or just quit scamming loyal fans with this inferior product.",1212796800,55,1441,4.649606299212598

So, Marimar, who lives in a coastal town, falls in love with Sergio, Eduardo Capetillo's character. Sergio marries her (kinda in a whim) but later falls in love with her. Yet, his stepmother hates Marimar and sets her up to go to jail, kills her grandparents and makes her believe Sergio doesn't love her. This sets Marimar in a path for revenge. She becomes a new and improved Marimar and assumes the identity of Bella. And of course everyone believes that she is not Marimar, cause this is a telenovela after all. The story then revolves about how these two characters fight aasint all the odds to be together.

The telenovela is not as edited down as other ones. So, you get a pretty good picture of what the full series was like.

They actually use the theme song from ""Maria la del Barrio"" for the back drop of the TRAYECTORIAS and for the backdrop song on discs 2 and 3!

I love ""Maria la del Barrio"", but it ruins the ""Marimar"" expereince.

2439553,5,B000BSQZ00,"For those of you who like drama/romance and are a big fan of Thalia (who sang with Fat Joe), the pop Mexican singer and actress, this 1994 soap launched Thalia as an international star. Translated into all languages MARIMAR is the most popular and beloved soap that Thalia made and is the second of the so-called ""Maria triligoy"" in which she plays poor peasent girls named Maria.
STORY PLOT: Marimar, who's name means ""Maria from the Ocean"" lives by the sea with her grandparents in a small broken down shack. One day she meets a local soccor player named Sergio (Eduardo Capetillo) the son of Renato, the owner of an Hacienda (mansion.) Sergio's only desire is to recieve his part of the family inheritance in order to leave the small town along the coast and move into Mexico City. One day while stealing vegatbles from thier garden to feed her starving family, Marimar meets Sergio and falls in love immediately. Due to her innocence and lack of education, Marimar marries him shortly thereafter, unaware that Sergio was using her to further anger his father and cruel stepmother Angelica (Chantal Andere) because his father refused to give Sergio his part of the inheritance. Angelica does everything she can to embaress Marimar and force her out of the house. When Marimar returns to the shack, her husband informs her that he must go to the big city and find work...and so he leaves her despite her pleas not to. Angelica goes as far as forcing Marimar to her knees and pulling a bracelete out of the mud with her bare teeth, believing that the expensive bracelet belonged Sergio's mother. Angelica then accused her of theft and Marimar is sent to jail. While she's there her grandparents are killed when the small shack in which they lived is burned to the ground during the night as ordered by Angelica. When the charges are dropped by her, Marimar is forced to leave the small town and head into the big city to find work and make a living...where months later her path crosses once again with her husband. Believing that his wife is still at her home, Sergio at first does not recognize Marimar, as by now she had changed her name to ""Bella"" (Precious) and she had become a very-well educated woman, who appeared to have a very wealthy family. Marimar had in fact been taken in as a houseemaid by her own father, who had been looking for her. Not knowing that Marimar was his daughter and she not knowing that Gustavo was her father, he taught her how to walk, dress, speak, read...in the ways of the wealthy society. Eventually they both realize through Marimar's birth certificate who she really is. Months later when Marimar gives birth to a daughter and conceals that fact from everyone, except her family and close friends, she once again crosses path with not only Sergio, but also Angelica. Suspecting but not believing who she was, Angelica slowly falls victim to Marimar's plan to strip her and her husband of their fortune. Now the tables turn as it becomes an eye for an eye. Marimar would seduce Sergio only to reject him at the last minute. While she was in prison, Angelica had written and sent her a false letter suppoesdly written by Sergio in which he says he never loved her and that he wanted to divorce as soon as possible. Marimar does everything Angelica made her do when she was just a poor innocent girl...she manipulates Angelica, embaresses her, humilates her...by the time they all realize who Bella really is, it's too late. Marimar had by then forced them onto the street, becoming the new owner of thier Hacienda. In raged, Angelica vows to avenge herself and her husband by making Marimar ""vanish from the face of the earth,"" however...the story has several more twists...including Sergio divorcing Marimar and then marrying another woman, thus adding yet another rival to the story. Marimar vows to avenge her grandparent's death and will stop at nothing until her enemy, Angelica, whom she knows is responsible for thier death, pays dearly ""with tears of blood.""
Altough MARIMAR losses her innocene and becomes a bitter cold woman, she is still very good at heart. The story never does cease to surprise and capitivate audiences worldwide! The soap, along with the theme song, earned Thalia the title as ""The Queen of Telenoelas.""
