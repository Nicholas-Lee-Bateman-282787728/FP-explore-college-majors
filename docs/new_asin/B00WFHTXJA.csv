7131510,2,B00WFHTXJA,"Three young American bimbos travel to Thailand to do volunteer work teaching English to children.  None of the three ever comes across as remotely believable teachers--it isn't just looks, although the two blondes would have been typecast as cheerleaders if they were a few years younger--it's that the characters are genuinely down to the bone stupid.

Basically what happens is they are set up with a house to live in and accidentally release the spirit of a vengeful little girl that had been sacrificed and trapped inside a golden statue.  One night after they bring three men home from a bar the spirit somehow possesses all three women simultaneously and causes them to brutally torture and murder their dates--something they think was a dream the next morning even though the fact that they all dreamed of murdering their dates might have seemed more than unlikely if these characters weren't so conveniently stupid.

They eventually visit a female shaman who helpfully gives them a lot of expositionary information about what the statue was and what the spirit of the little girl wants in what sounds like badly dubbed Godzilla style English.  Later they speak to an old man who lives next door and fills them in further since he was part of the ritual that made the golden statue out of the little girl who had been his niece.  Meanwhile it turns out the reason ghost girl is leading our dumb Americans to these people is not so they can find help or learn the child's tragic story.

There is no shortage of Thai horror movies but Pernicious feels like a western movie filmed in Thailand--it takes more of an outsider's approach to filming colorful and exotic locations and has a hard time dealing coherently with the Thai mythology.  Pernicious is clearly intended to be tongue in cheek but that doesn't make it any easier to stomach the three endlessly obnoxious lead characters who never show the tiniest bit of respect for Thai culture or for any Thai people they encounter--if ever three characters deserved their terrible fates that is most definitely the case here.

It's entirely possible someone satisfied with beautiful women, exotic locations and a little gore will find Pernicious a decent enough entertainment.  I mostly felt bad the heroines were representing America so poorly--if these are our teachers imagine how stupid that would make the rest of us.",1434844800,,2378,4.9225
7131511,3,B00WFHTXJA,"(Pericious) follows three young women as they explore Thailand ,having fun until they find a strange gold statue of a young girl (Vanida) who was murdered and wants revenge on anything with a pulse! The acting is fine and the story as good if not better than most straight to DVD horror of late.

Unfortunately,it suffers  from cheesy dialogue and a predictible plotline. Where it shines is the gore and gore effects plus the beautiful locations and production value!

The soul of the murdered girl in the statue inhabits each of the girl's bodies turning them into heinious killers. The goriest part of the movie occurs when
 three horny guys pick up and roofie the girls only to encounter the spirit of Vanida instead and the girls turn the tables on them in the form of torure.

There are scenes of tooth and tongue removal,eyeball gouging, throat slitting,very well done stabbings,face and head bashing until brains are exposed plus other means of pain infliction! There were some pretty cool scenes with the golden girl climbing walls etc reminiscent of (The Grudge).

There's nothing really new or ground breaking here but if you want to watch a slasher with a decent amount of gore that is really well done by very attractive girls I say give it a watch. 3 -1\2 stars",1433203200,2,1274,4.742081447963801
7131512,3,B00WFHTXJA,"The multicultural story was co-written by Taryn Hillin and blends urban legend with supernatural mythology. Westerners head out into the big ole world only to become prey for societal degenerates and local superstitions. Pernicious takes on three lovely birds with one bloody and brutal stone. It is a bit of a departure from Bressacks gritty, real world character studies in horror like Hate Crime and To Jennifer,It is a cut above the a fore mentioned supernatural horrors with a tighter story that holds up from start to finish. It isn't as straight forward as you think going into the story which adds a greater amount of suspense to the film. The acting is a bit lukewarm, with often disconnected line deliveries, and dramatic expressiveness. At times it feels a bit Lifetime.

The special effects and cinematography are what really hold Pernicious together. There are moments when Bresseck almost serenades Eli Roth with the full on gory scenes of violence. The blood, grue and kills are very exploitative and visceral, something that I really beg for in my horror-more so lately. Yet it is carefully blended with a surreal, atmospheric chilliness that elevates the horror to true ghost story expectations. Combine that with the quality filming framed around a fascinating  and scenic environment and you have a world class horror story.

Overall Pernicious is a great story, well written and carefully executed. It brings a bit of the more exotic superstitious nature of the world into western mentalities. The actual scare-factor isn't really present in the film, but the suspense and horror are very much here. The acting at times does fill forced, with choppy dialog given during dramatic scenes, and Bressecks in-your-face brutality of man is missing in this one. The bottom line is this, Pernicious offers a more Lifetime Movie Network After Dark experience on a R-rated level.",1431216000,3,1889,5.106796116504855
7131513,3,B00WFHTXJA,"This movie is good; and bad.

The girls are very attractive.  There are some decent gore FX and a couple of creepy scenes; not creepy in a fresh way, but creepy is as creepy does.

The main issue is the acting, which is on par with just about anyone reading this who isn't camera shy.  I hope they didn't pay for lessons.

Anyway, IT IS worth a watch so long as you don't have to pay for it.",1447718400,,391,3.9615384615384617
7131514,2,B00WFHTXJA,"The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the concept was nice. The acting however, so unbelievably forced and scripted. Ya they were pretty to look at, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Again though, I liked the overall concept of the movie.",1446422400,,255,4.446808510638298
7131515,5,B00WFHTXJA,"I actually really liked this movie. James's story line kept my interest
 I have always loved supernatural type movies with different cultural backgrounds. I would have loved to see more of the creepy golden girl. If you are not into gore, this  movie won't be for you. I love the approach taken on this movie.",1444521600,,309,4.6
7131516,1,B00WFHTXJA,"It's a step up from the director's previous outings (he actually got a budget here), but it's still pretty sloppy.

From the get-go, it's apparent Bressack still has A LOT to learn about directing, editing and scoring.

The music is extremely abrasive, intrusive and way too campy (sounds like Richard Band's brother scored the thing). Nearly every scene has some sort of cheesy music to reinforce scary things or the whimsy of being in a new locale.

The shots, especially early on, are very shaky when doing aerials and then become very bland after that. There's no clever use of composition, especially considering the potential beauty of the land they were shooting in. One awkward shot in particular has the camera slowly walk into the side of a staircase--as a transition??? Not up the staircase, not down it, not along the railing, not beside it--INTO the side of one of the steps... Once the film gets into torture territory, the scenery looks like a poor man's Hostel. After this, the movie becomes a ghost story that outright plagiarizes one of the shots/scares from The Grudge. I have to admit though, the scenes with the golden ghost child were hilarious--especially the bathtub scene which looks like someone blurred the reflection on a metal surface in post--it looked as if the movie was censoring itself.

As the film progresses, the sloppiness becomes even more apparent. I actually had to stop the film and rewind it because at 48 minutes (I believe--when the trio of chicks first meet the witch lady), the editor accidentally inserted another music piece OVER another the music that's already playing before abruptly stopping it. I couldn't believe that something so glaring would be overlooked so I rewound it and sure enough, they failed to watch their own movie and remove the jarring mistake. Still, funny though.

Beyond that, certain interior locations are blatantly just rooms the redecorated to look like something else. Case in point, the bathroom. While they shot in at least two homes, the director chose to recreate a bathroom instead of using the existing ones in each house. Thus, these scenes look supremely cheap as a ""shower scene"" consisted of shower rods/curtains being hung in a random room which they sprayed water all over the actresses and floor. The bathtub scene also looks like a blatant set instead of a bathroom which again, begs the question, why not just use an actual shower? They also dealt with Thai actors, so why did they cast an American--or perceived American--as the near-silhouetted Tai Witch? Oh, that's right, exposition.

And then there's the story, which had some grains of creativity (only in the historical concept; not the execution), but was wholly undone by plot-holes, near-constant and hilariously expository dialogue from every character and well, nothing that really made any sense... At all. It was as if someone went through a checklist of spooky cliches and then just shot them in order. Even the denouement completely lacks logic and is just there as a wink-wink-maybe-there'll-be-a-single kinda dealio.",1444003200,,3078,5.049212598425197
7131517,2,B00WFHTXJA,Very gory but the story was unoriginal and the acting was bad. It seemed like they were trying to mix Hostel with The Grudge and those two just don't mix well.,1441584000,,159,4.161290322580645

I suggest keeping your eye on this guy.",1436572800,,560,4.394230769230769
7131527,3,B00WFHTXJA,"The film opens with some sort of blood sacrifice in Thailand. It is followed by  three American girls showing up at a remote Thai home so they can teach children the alphabet. Okay they don't speak the local language, so what, they are nice to look at. It is an odd remote village, one that they can only reach by boat, but can take a cab out of there. It has WI-fi, but no cell phone reception.

The film held my interest for a while as you knew The Golden Child would work its way into the story of three girls known as Jules (Emily O'Brien) and two sisters lovingly referred to as Crazy (Ciara Hanna) and Crazier (Jackie Moore). In fact their slap downs proved to be entertaining as they call Alex everything but a slut. Once the girls appeared to have been roofied, the film shifts gears for the better. The problem was when it was time to bring it home, the gears jammed into a been there , done that, ho-hum horror.

Okay for a cheap rental.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. No nudity. Major league high beams. Girls shower with undergarments on. No seriously, they do. Some ""torture porn."" Sara Malakul Lane in a minor role.",1435536000,2,1122,4.354066985645933

Ummmmm....

When I last visited Hawaii, I was fully packed for a massacre. I don't know how these girls could have not planned for that. It's like forgetting your sunscreen.

This video was just another clunker, boring and without chills or thrills of any kind. Kudos for the blood, of which there was some, but the story, acting, and cinematography were what I'd expect from a microbudget weekend shoot. Very disappointed.",1435190400,5,560,5.0
7131529,2,B00WFHTXJA,"Good acting, bad effects...Cheesy music and not enough of emotion or depth on story. Felt like a bad 80's slasher",1435104000,,113,4.7
7131530,4,B00WFHTXJA,"A chilling story line that has you on the edge of your seat till the end crafted with delicate care. The movie began with a strong hook that maintained through the film. While the acting had minor week spots, overall the cast brought a nicely blended trio of diversity among each sister. There was just enough gore to ice a layer of gruesome without being excessive. Creative twists and torture scenes that left no unanswered questions. The story line had a strong foundation having been based on a Thailand legend giving the movie a sense of realism if you will. The concept was not completely original, but nicely presented and thoroughly entertaining. A great late night horror flick with an ending to make you cringe.",1435104000,,721,4.776
7131531,4,B00WFHTXJA,"Pernicious follows three college aged American girls on a summer trip to Thailand. When they arrive, they discover an ancient golden statue of a small girl in the house they're staying in. Their trip takes a turn for the worse after they uncover the statue, unleashing an evil spirit housed within. As the body count rises, the mystery deepens as they attempt to figure out why the spirit is bound to the statue and the reasons behind it's bloody desire for revenge.

This is one of those films that at times reminds you of others, and you think you know what's going to happen next based off of those, but then it flips the script on you. It's at times part Hostel, at times part The Grudge, and there's even a hint of Pumpkinhead in there, yet it still manages to be it's own thing. It's hard to explain. As the plot played out, every single time I thought I knew what was going on, it threw a twist at me. It never went off the rails, but it kept me guessing. Whenever a movie can do that, I definitely consider it a win. The cast mostly performs well, with Ciara Hanna and Jackie Moore being the standouts, as Alex and Rachel respectively. The third of the girls, Julia, was played by Emily O'Brien and she had a few brief moments where reactions were a bit extreme to situations, but she was far from the worst I've ever seen.

Effects wise there was your standard practical/cg mixture. Thankfully most of the blood and gore was of the practical type, while the cg was left mostly to animating the statue. The practical stuff was great, the cg was probably serviceable at best. The budget for this movie went into so many things, practical effects, camera shots, location, etc., that I am more than forgiving if what little cgi is in it isn't quite cutting edge. It looks fine, trust me.

Coming from a guy who shot and edited an entire movie using an iPhone once, Pernicious is a great example of what James Cullen Bressack can do when he's given a real budget and let loose. Gore hounds will appreciate the head bashing and throat slitting, fans of supernatural fare will enjoy the creepy atmosphere and overall tone of impending dread. It's brutally violent at times, moves at a good pace, and tells a story that's entertaining and intriguing from start to finish. Highly recommended for fans of ghost/revenge movies, but Pernicious has a little something for everybody.",1435104000,,2378,4.56440281030445

The chicks (I'm only using that word because that's clearly how the filmmakers view them) decide to party down before school starts, but it seems the house they are living in is haunted with...well, something or other. Some gory murders to wake you up, but since the victims are always tied down, there is no tension or suspense. Additional caveat for those interested: though the three chicks often prance around in their underwear and short-short shorts, there's no nudity. I guess they didn't want to lose their dignity. Why the rating for this garbage is not hovering around 2 or 3 suggests the cast and crew (and friends and relatives of both) were instructed to vote.",1458086400,,1054,5.098265895953757

Different shades of blood are used, but this can depend on which vessels it is from. None of it is anywhere as pink as in Saw Final Chapter, and I am tempted to give the effects team the benefit of the doubt. In that case this is a very good film. The girls look nearly as good in minimal underwear as they would do naked, so I have no complaints there either, and the script gives some reason for their apparent shyness. The bloodshed is well paced but fairly frequent, as the teacher girls face up to their darkest nightmares about overseas superstitiouns. I am not sure which language the original soundtrack was, and many persons involved in making the film are Thai, which is where the movie is set,  and expect some good looking locations and occasional desolate ones.",1450828800,,871,4.44375
