8101234,4,B000CRQW1W,"30 bucks is a lot for it considering the Jonah/Tomberry piece you're buying it for is only about 12 1/12 minutes long.  Especially if (as in my case) you already bought the Siggraph Video Review DVD from 2005 that contained it (for about twice that price) and picked this up hoping to see more.  And you likely wouldn't even be looking here if you haven't already seen it somewhere.  Then again, chances are you shelled out for the Brother's Quay DVDs, and Jonah/Tomberry gives Street of Crocodiles a real run for it's surrealist money.  No question, it's quite brilliant, and the 50 minute ""making of"" video is a nice addition, as learning how things were done IS pretty darn interesting.  It's clear from the fact they don't keep how it's done a secret that they have lots more where that came from and know how to use it.  There's lots of other related shorts, but nothing quite in the same class as the Jonah/Tomberry piece.  It will nevertheless keep you busy for about 90 minutes scouring the menus making sure you haven't missed anything, and they did spend a lot of time on the menus and other packaging.  Mind blowing certainly, ""always leave 'em wanting more,"" of course, but it's a bit TOO tantalizing.  It's one hell of a portfolio-- hopefully trolling for some serious theatrical financing, rather than simply job offers doing effects for someone elses ideas.",1166572800,3,1372,4.73109243697479
