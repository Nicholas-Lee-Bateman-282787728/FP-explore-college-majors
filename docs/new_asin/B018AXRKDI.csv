8741947,4,B018AXRKDI,"Loved the movie. It showed most Christian values and a weakness or two.  Excellent for teens and young adults, although one part I think they could have left out as being okay for someone set on living a pure life. Better than most Christian movies I've seen.",1510272000,,259,4.51063829787234

8741949,3,B018AXRKDI,"This was good but not great.  The lead actors were very appealing and there was a wholesome side to the story that was very welcome.  I miss seeing Victoria Rowell  from when she used to be on Young & Restless, so I loved seeing her here and seeing another side of her acting ability.  She plays an elegant, savvy, middle-aged mom very well.  I thought there were a couple of vulgar moments in the film (and Im not a prude) that didn't tie into the theme of the rest of the movie, for example there is a scene where the young men are ogling a group of women in a yoga class (we know its a yoga class because there are handmade signs saying yoga taped to the walls, LOL).  The men are leering at the women and one of them goes into the room and starts coming on to and touching one of the heavier ladies.  She rightly punches him out and then he makes a rude comment about her being fat.  It just didn't tie into the rest of the film (family togetherness, loyalty, good morals and manners, going to church etc). I'm not saying people have to be perfect and can't be flawed (we all are), but it just didn't fit. Then parts of the movie were rushed and hard to believe (the two leads are in love and agree to withhold physical intimacy until after marriage, so then theydress in sexy nightwear and get into bed together??  It wasn't clear to me whether they did anything but sleepbut that was just stupid and unbelievable).  The opening scene was supposed to be in a restaurant where they were holding a celebration for the young man who became a lawyer and is joining his fathers firm.  The actors were all very attractive but the setting was very cheesy (wouldnt they have gone to a fancier restaurant in real life?) and the camaraderie between the actors was so forced, I had to look away (they were trying to joke around in the teasing way you do with old friends and close family members, and it was just so fake and forced I couldn't stand it).  I loved the work of the young female lead - she was sweet and genuine, despited the movie's sometimes stilted dialogue.  Anyway  bottom line, its nowhere in the top 10 of anything when it comes to movies, but its a decently made film with a few very good performances.",1491177600,2,2217,4.3108433734939755

8741954,5,B018AXRKDI,"I don't own this movie yet but saw it for the first time today on Centric. A beautiful Christian story line about faith, family, love, and happiness. Overall good writing and amazing actors.",1470268800,2,190,4.787878787878788
8741955,5,B018AXRKDI,"This was an outstanding movie for a first time writer, producer and director - Lisa Haynes. It was a good mix of known talent and up and coming talent. I really enjoyed the storyline and the interwoven drama between the two strong supporting cast - Darryl Booker (aka Tony Boston) and Sir Brodie (aka Rob Stewart), I also enjoyed the playful interactions with Darryl Booker and the Hudson brothers (aka Mick & Nick). It's a good family/first date movie with lots of laughs and a faith-based message...job well done. I can't wait for the sequel :-)",1464480000,3,547,4.708333333333333
8741956,4,B018AXRKDI,"A very good movie. It had a good story line and it did not look like a low budget movie with a famous cast. This movie is based off of two people who come together under false pretenses on the hope of destroying another family member, but real love develops in the end.",1461628800,3,269,4.09433962264151
