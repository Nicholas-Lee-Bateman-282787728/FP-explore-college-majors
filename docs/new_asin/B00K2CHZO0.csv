6399031,4,B00K2CHZO0,"I am an avid reader and typically read the book before the movie. If I see a trailer for a movie that looks good and I know that movie is based on a book that I haven't read yet, I'll hurry up and read the book first so I can then see the movie. For This Is Where I Leave You (or TIWILY, as I've affectionately dubbed it), the book was on my ""to-read"" list but never quite made it up high enough for me to read it, yet I ended up seeing the movie anyway. And it was a GREAT movie, that has just bumped the book up to the top of my list.

The movie centers around the Altman family, who reunites when the patriarch of the family passes away. He leaves a wife (Jane Fonda) and 4 adult children. Apparently, his last wish was for his family to hold shiva by mourning him for 7 days. So.. All 4 children begrudgingly move back into their childhood home for the week to grieve their father. Everyone has their own problems and struggles, which are soon shared with the rest of the family, and many times in an embarrassing fashion with visiting mourners as well. Paul (Corey Stoll), the oldest son, and his wife are struggling with infertility issues and this week happens to be when she's ovulating. Tina Fey has a detached husband that's married to his work, leaving her to deal with a baby and a potty-training toddler (who was one of my favorite characters), on top of everything else going on. Plus, she hasn't quite gotten over her high school boyfriend (Timothy Olyphant) who never left the small town due to a brain injury. Then Judd (Jason Bateman) is separated from his wife after catching her cheating on him, but doesn't want to share the news with the rest of the family yet. Last we have Philip (Adam Driver), the baby of the family that's never quite grown up, who shows up with his cougar therapist-turned-sugar momma girlfriend in tow.

From there the movie takes us through the week with all of these characters. I'm not typically a fan of ""dramedies"", as I feel it's usually misleading. It's always a drama trying to sucker people in by pretending to be a comedy, or vice versa. I went into this movie not expecting much, but I ended up thinking the movie felt really realistic. Family members would get into fights, then later make up or have each other's back when it really counted, but it was all done in a believable but not overbearing way, in my opinion. The whole movie was just relatable and touching, and the characters well-developed. TIWILY was a LOT funnier than I expected, but it did have its moments where it was tugging on my heart strings a little.

Overall, I loved it. The only negative thing I can say about it is that Tina Fey is an awful fake-cryer. Other than that, it was a heartwarming and funny movie. And since the author of the book also wrote the screenplay, I'm sure the book will be just as good..",1412121600,5,2843,4.380681818181818
6399032,4,B00K2CHZO0,"I won't lie, I was thinking I was going to hate watching this movie. For while I love Rose Byrne, everyone else I was sort of unsure of. Especially Jason Bateman since after The Longest Week I was beginning to think of him as a clear sign that a movie isn't worth looking at. Though remembering he was in Juno, as well as many other films I like, perhaps it is just his most recent movies aren't my thing. Rather than him being a dangerous name to see attached to anything like Eugene Levy. But I digress, lets talk about the movie.

Characters & Story

Judd Altman (Jason Bateman) has just been dealt a series of blows in his life. His wife Quinn (Abigail Spencer) is cheating on him with his boss Wade (Dax Shepard), and his dad dies. Something which, at any other time, would be truly horrible, but with it being a good excuse to get the hell out of town, it is something which presents mixed emotions. Though while Judd isn't having that great of a life right now, neither are his siblings. His oldest brother Paul (Corey Stoll) is having issues with his wife Annie (Kathryn Hahn) when it comes to getting pregnant and, to make matters interesting, Annie is Judds ex. Then there comes Wendy (Tina Fey) who is in a rocky relationship with her husband, has two kids by him, and is now back in town where her ex Horry (Timothy Olyphant) is. Someone who pretty much is the love of her life, but guilt and tragedy keep them from being together. Leaving the youngest brother Phillip (Adam Driver) who is wild, crazy, and pretty immature. However, with the family back together for the funeral, as well as to honor the wishes of their dad, chaos ensues. All of which their mother Hillary (Jane Fonda) tries to quell, sometimes.

Praise

What I love most about this film is that the characters don't seem like a bunch of people slapped together without any sort of connection or chemistry. Everyone in the family seems to have a genuine love for each other, and a unique relationship with one another. Especially Phillip who, smartly, the film utilizes quite well. For with the majority of the cast dealing with marital problems in various ways, Phillip/ Driver makes for an excellent comic relief.

Though this isn't to say the rest of the cast isn't funny. Everyone gets the chance to have their moment, but none of it feels like they are telling a joke just because. Each joke seems specially geared for who is speaking it, and seems like it fits the moment they are in. Whether it is a joke about Hillarys new breast, Wendys son who likes to poop outside, or even the jokes shared between Penny (Rose Bryne) and Judd.

Leading to one last thing worth praising: The movie doesnt end with things wrapped up in a pretty bow and everything resolved. Something I quite liked for it really made it seem we were spending about a week with a real life family, rather than seeing characters who appear and disappear once the movie begins and ends, and seem like their lives will cease to exist. Though, I must admit, it does leave you wanting answers. But this is based off a book so answers maybe within there.

Criticism

When it comes to criticism, I must admit I felt, probably due to my own prejudice, not really into the movie when it started. For with the way Fey delivered the news about the dad dying, with her having a horrible sad/ crying face, my eyes were rolling and I was already starting to get antsy to leave. But as things became more genuine, I realized it was just me. Making it so the only real issue I had was those which I made up in my head due to preconceived notions.

Overall: Worth Seeing

This is one of those rare films which are ensemble pieces and works. For with most doting too much on one characters story, or perhaps one being really strong while the rest of them are weak, usually you get a lopsided feature when so many recognizable names are sharing a film. However, This Is Where I Leave You somehow finds a good balance so everyone gets to be established, becomes uniquely lovable, and leaves you with the hope something better is on the horizon for them. Hence why Im labeling this as worth seeing.",1411862400,5,4131,4.4813829787234045
6399033,4,B00K2CHZO0,"Shawn Levy's (""The Internship"", ""Real Steel"") latest dramedy focuses on a family who have just lost the patriarch.  Hillary (Jane Fonda) asks that her, now grown, children return to their childhood home and remain under the same roof for a week in the Jewish tradition.  They reluctantly agree, but of course bring baggage with them.  Both literally and figuratively.

Corey Stoll is Paul, the oldest who has helped his father manage their small business.  Next is Wendy (Tina Fey) whose husband (Barry Weissman) is one of those ""too busy"" business executives who constantly has a Bluetooth plugged into his ear.  Younger brother Judd (Jason Bateman) brings news of an impending divorce as he caught his wife (Abigail Spencer) in bed with his boss (Dax Shepard).  Interestingly, these actor's real ages are the exact opposite of those in the film.  Stoll is the youngest, then Fey.  Bateman is actually the oldest.  Then there is the baby brother and wild child, Phillip (Adam Driver) who brings his older girlfriend (Connie Britton), and her Porsche, to the affair.

The family bring what seems to be an unusual array of dysfunctions into the home that it would seem unlikely.  All the marriages are in some level of dissolution.  And to no regular moviegoer's surprise, there are the small town romances left behind (Rose Byrne and Timothy Olyphant) that get rekindled. And mom has a big surprise of her own.

This is mostly a drama but there are enough chuckles provided by Fonda, Fey and Bateman to keep it relatively light.  This is no ""August: Osage County"" in terms of bitterness and dialog but there is some bite.  For those of us with enough years of experience, you're likely to find some malady to identify with.  That keeps it real.",1411603200,105,1744,4.857627118644068
6399034,4,B00K2CHZO0,"""This Is Where I Leave You"" (2014 release; 103 min.) brings the story of the four grown-up (?) Altman siblings. As the movie opens, we get to know Judd (played by Jason Bateman), a radio program producers. Judd can't wait to surprise his wife with a birthday cake, only to find her in bed with a man, and not just any man, no, it's his boss. Not long thereafter, Judd gets a call from his sister Wendy (played by Tina Fey), who informs him that Dad has just passed away. After the funeral, Mon (played by Jane Fonda) informs them that Dad's last wish was that they'd sit shiva (7 days of mourning under the Jewish tradition).Judd, Wendy, Paul (played by Corey Stoll) and Phillip (played buy Adam Driver), and their assorted spouses/significant others, reluctantly agree. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by Shawn Levy, who among many other movies, previously directed Tina Fey on ""Date Night"" a couple of years ago, and in fact, these two movies feel somewhat similar, even though the story lines are very different. Second, the movie faces a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde challenge: is it a drama or is it a comedy? In the end, it's a dramedy, and to me the movie falls short due to this schizophrenic shifting between drama and comedy. It's only in the last 20 min. of so, when nobody needs to be funny anymore to impress anyone or us, the audience, that the movie acquires a calm to it that I think was needing before. Some may say that the movie acquires a bittersweet tone then and that is just fine by me. Third, there is an amazing pool of acting talent assembled in this movie, almost an embarrassment of riches. Jason Bateman is the glue that holds it all together, more so that Tina Fey (whom I thought was strangely quasi-invisible). Adam Driver, who I just saw recently in ""What If"", brings another one of those 'crazy' performances, but you can just see the talent dripping off of him. But perhaps the biggest surprise of all for me was Jane Fonda, now 76 if you can believe it, giving her best performance in YEARS. Not yet mentioned is Rose Byrne as Judd's potential love interest. I saw her last year in ""I Give It A Year"", and here again she oozes charm and brightens up the screen. Last but not least, there is a very nice score to the movie, composed by Michael Giacchino, as well as a bunch of unrelated songs (Cindy Lauper's classic ""Time After Time"" plays a crucial role; Coldplay's ""Reign Of Love"" equally so). Bottom line: I don't know whether ""This Is Where I Leave You"" is supposed to be a comedy or a drama. At one point, after yet another huge squabble among the siblings, someone sighs ""We don't like each other, do we?"", ha! In the end ""This Is Where I Leave You"" is a little bit of both drama and comedy, and ends up being neither... It's not a bad movie of course, but with so much acting talent, and delivering some great performances, the movie for me didn't live up to its full potential.

The movie opened this past weekend, and I finally had a chance to see it today. For a weekday evening, the screening where I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, so maybe this movie will prove to have some legs at the box office. If you like ""dramedy"" and appreciate good acting performances, I'd recommend you check this out, be it in the theatres, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1411430400,,3450,4.4659270998415215
6399035,5,B00K2CHZO0,"Because of the trailers and the cast, I have really been looking forward to this one! Like other R-rated comedies, you can expect some bad language, sexual situations and mild drug use, but this isn't director Shawn Levy's (""Date Night"") first rodeo. His skill is evident all the way through.

The father of the Altman tribe has died and the family convenes in their home town for the funeral. Dad's last wish was that they sit Shiva (stay under the same roof together) for the full seven days. This is odd because they weren't really observant Jews, but the four adult children and various spouses go along with it.

Here is part of the large cast:
  * Jason Bateman (""Identity Thief"") Judd is the most stable sibling. He has a good job, an apartment in the city, a lovely wife and his uncomplicated life is good...until he comes home early one day to surprise her for her birthday.
  * Tina Fey (""30 Rock"") Wendy is the only girl, so she pretty much raised her baby brother because Mom was busy writing and selling her book.
  * Adam Driver (""Girls"") Phillip is the youngest sibling and a total flake, but it is his sister Wendy's voice he hears in his head. He is heedless, thoughtless and careless...also selfish.
  * Corey Stoll (""The Strain"") Paul is the son who stayed; he helped their father at the store. He is decent, responsible, and happily married to a woman who desperately wants a baby.
  * Kathryn Hahn (""Parks & Recreation"") Alice will do anything to get pregnant; she's THAT desperate!
  * Rose Byrne (""Neighbors"") Penny appears out of nowhere, to Judd's delighted surprise. They knew one another ""back in the day"" and she still lives in that small town. She thinks ""complicated"" is interesting.
  * Timothy Olyphant (""Justified"") Horry still lives with his mother across the street. He and Wendy share a wrenching history.
  * Jane Fonda (""The Newsroom"") Mommy tells all four of her reluctant children they are grounded until they grant their father's final wish.

In my opinion, Tina Fey, Jason Bateman and most particularly Timothy Olyphant are three of the most appealing actors working today. This film gets a bit ""talky,"" but any time any or all three of them appear on screen, I'm happy. I'll own the DVD because much of the dialogue got by me. If you have a hearing problem, try to see it in a theater that is equipped for closed captions. I liked it, anyway.",1411257600,54,2385,4.649164677804296
6399036,4,B00K2CHZO0,"Between this movie and ""Tammy,"" it does not appear to be a good idea for a film character to ditch work early in order to ""surprise"" a spouse, as they will find that there is company of the opposite gender.  In Judd Altman's (Jason Bateman's) case in ""This Is Where I Leave You,"" he goes home to celebrate his wife's birthday only to discover her in bed with his boss (Dax Shepard) and that their affair has been going on for no less than a year.

Judd is abruptly interrupted from his depression by a call from his sister Wendy (Tina Fey), informing him that their father has passed away.  When he goes home to join his two other siblings, his mother (Jane Fonda), sporting brand new breast implants, tells him that their dad's last wish is for them to sit shivah all week (despite the fact they have never celebrated any Jewish holidays).  This means that the siblings will have to remain under the same roof as their mom, with whom they have a few issues along the lines of her invading their privacy as youths in order to write a best-seller.  While Judd's spouse is not in attendance and Wendy's shortly departs on a business trip, his two brothers have a spouse/girlfriend respectively in tow.  One is determined to have a baby and is undergoing fertility treatment, and the other is a much older therapist who inexplicably finds something to admire in the irresponsible youngest brother (Adam Driver).  Oh, and don't forget the wacky rabbi, a childhood friend of the clan, whose old nickname gets way too much time as running gag.  Add to that two small children, a skating instructor who had a crush on Judd as a teen, Mom's close friend next door and her brain-injured adult son (who once had a thing going with Wendy), and you have plenty of room for high jinks and heartwarming life lessons.

The cast uniformly does an excellent job with the material, including the actor playing the character undergoing potty training.  Bateman's character has to do some challenging stuff acting-wise - such as somehow make an entire conversation lying on his back on the ice be something more than bizarre,  but he manages it.  However, there are jokes that are way too overdone (see the rabbi's nickname), and overall, the movie's tone felt hollow to me.  There's a scene where Fey rests her head on Fonda's bosom and admits that it actually feels quite comforting.  That's kind of what watching the movie was like for me - surprisingly well-executed but somehow artificial feeling.",1411171200,3,2482,4.688940092165899

I mean, they even got Timothy ""Justified"" Olyphant in a small role here as well as Jane ""Is she really 80?"" Fonda. Another thing is although I never watched an episode of ""Arrested Development,"" I seem to keep watching movies with Jason Bateman in them. Not that I mind as his understated Jimmy Stewart meets John Cusack vibe I kind of dig. Also, Tina Fey really can act and not just in ""SNL"" type comedies.

Hot Toasty Rag, September 28, 2017

Jane Fondas husband has died, and her four children return home for the funeral. The oldest son, Corey Stall, has marital troubles with his wife, Kathryn Hahn, who used to be his younger brothers girlfriend. Jason Bateman, just found out his wife cheated on him, and he seeks to numb his heartache with Rose Byrne, a friend from high school. Tina Feys husband ignores her and works too much, and she has an emotionally complex history with the neighbor, Timothy Olyphant. And the problemed child, Adam Driver, is involved with an older woman, Connie Britton. With all the childrens problems, is there any room for Jane Fonda? Yes, there is. She, just like her children, has problems and secrets that are bound to come out over the weekend.

Im sure every viewer will take his own opinion of the film, but I was pretty split down the middle. Jason Batemans storyline takes the lead, and it was my worst part of the film. Rose Byrne was wholly unlikable, and I wished that both she and Jason would have surrendered their screen time to someone else. Adam Drivers part of the plot is much smaller, but its more interesting. His girlfriend is a therapist, and his character, more than anyone, shows the damage dysfunctional parenting does to children. By far, Tina Feys segment was my favorite. Yes, shes famous for her comedic talents, but when she tackles a dramatic scene, shes surprisingly talented. The scenes she shares with Timothy Olyphant are very touching.

This Is Where I Leave You is a very typical dysfunctional family film, so if you don't like those types of movies, you're not going to like this one. I watched it because I like Jane Fonda, but its not a movie Ill probably want to rent again.

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some adult content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie.",1506556800,,1923,4.680473372781065

6399083,5,B00K2CHZO0,"I bought this for my mom after she asked for it for a while. She already saw and liked the film.
To her, it was a grand story of what could happen if she could get all her siblings to mourn their mother in a much better way than they did.
She's very tech inept so I have to put it on for her so I know how many times she's watched it. It's been well over ten times.

While I don't really like the movie, to my mom it's helped her grieve.",1505088000,,437,3.6989247311827955

It's really a drama about a dysfunctional family, a funeral, sibling rivalry, starting a family, marital breakup, and reconnecting with old flames.

The patriarch is an atheist and the matriarch is not a Jew, but they have to hold shiva because the matriarch wants to keep her three sons and a daughter at home with her for seven days.  For such a non-Jewish family they turn out to be quite Jewish.  Who knew?  Maybe the joke is meant to be on the poor viewer.",1496275200,,736,4.623076923076923

Funny but with a point, which in my interpretation is 'family is your family - you don't have to like everything about the individuals - but when push comes to shove, you stand together and work through it'. The 'twist' in it is a real 'I gotcha' moment! The whole cast is on their game and I don't understand why it did not get a promotion push when it was released.

To top an excellent dinner and conversation we watched this incredible movie! From the cast to the story of a dysfunctional family who loses the father/husband figure! It has plenty of comedy and serious overtones of typical marital problems and boyfriend/girlfriend issues! A thoroughly enjoyable ""chick flick""! Another movie my fiancee hadn't seen b4! She was amazed that I would like a ""chick flick"" but it's an outstanding movie!",1494460800,,554,4.967741935483871
6399103,4,B00K2CHZO0,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Unfortunately, while this movie was good, Jonathan Tropper's novel that this is based on is much better (seriously, its freaking hilarious, as are all his books), so if I had to recommend between the 2, I'd say check out the book and then, if you liked it, maybe check out the movie.  But I think there's a lot better ""dramedies"" out there that are more worth your time.  Just seemed so rushed compared to the book (though I understand you can't fit everything or even most things when adapting a novel into a movie).  But yes, I do like and relate to stories about human, quirky, flawed characters and this still wasn't bad.  So even if you don't want to check out the book, if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1737,4.532051282051282

6399120,5,B00K2CHZO0,"If you want to laugh, cry, reminisce on family absurdity and WHY our families/lives are the craziest of stories; you must see this movie. The acting from everyone is pure genius; and I am a really tough critic.  Bateman as always is brilliant, and I wish I could keep him in my pocket for continual comic relief (we couldn't have wars if we had someone like him making everyone laugh...always amazing).  I have to say Jane Fonda has always been great in dramatic and comedic roles; but if you haven't seen her for awhile in films and then you do (such as this) I forgot how hilarious and brilliant she is.  Tina...'nough said....I love Kathryn, Rose, Paul, Connie, Olyphant, Boner (of course...sorry I love the screen name); but Adam Driver was a great surprise for me.  I have seen some of hie stuff and he's good...but this character is really great and shows his range and obviously shows those of us (like me) what a great actor he really is.  It is definitely a must see and a movie that you will watch over and over...maybe that's why you can only buy it and not rent!  Makes me want to watch every film/tv show Jason has done to keep that feeling he gives your heart when you watch him; fun goodness even in the toughest of times.  So glad he gives us all a bit of fun lightness in this heavy world.",1486512000,,1306,4.371900826446281

8655264,5,B00K2CHZO0,"Not sure what these other reviewers were watching, but it is truly a very well done story, full of great dialogue and space to allow thoughtful contemplation.  If you are human, you certainly can identify with almost any aspect, character, or situation this movie covers.  Timothy Oliphant plays a very interesting and tragically disabled character that is executed with very carefully with concise and powerful brevity.  There is absolutely no filler or underdeveloped character in this movie and I would say it is on course with being something between a Billy Wilder and a William Wyler style of film that touches on some very pertinent and pressing subject matters.  Shawn Levy should have received high accolades and an Oscar nomination for pulling off a great film, with a great cast, which can be hard to do.  And then, introducing the Rabbi character, formerly known as ""Boner"" is just great smart rich comedy.  So much original funny material and situations in this movie, that you have to watch it at least 4 times to get it all.  I could go on but you must see this movie.  I love Rose Byrne so much, not only because I think she is so beautiful, but again in her supporting role in this movie, her ability to convey emotions in a look or glance, layered in some hefty quick dialogue in stellar moments, just knocks me out!  Jane Fonda is an incredible character as well who again seems to truly manifest an ensemble with clarity and offering some surprises along the way.  Jason Bateman is again such an incredible professional and is just a great tactician in dialogue, which in his sublime way you can easily miss if you are not an attentive movie listener.  This film can be appreciated by someone who enjoys classic films with very good scripts and charcter development, not leaning on CG and FX to entertain you.",1530144000,,1829,4.720125786163522
