2815388,5,B000PC6YUS,"This is a wonderful movie of mystery, clues, hope, unfulfilled desires, and all one could want in a Father Brown mystery rolled into one story.  G.K. Chesterton nearly outdid himself with this one.  Don't miss it!!!",1361923200,,215,4.944444444444445
2815389,2,B000PC6YUS,"It's amazing why no one has said that the emperor has no clothes! Father Brown in the stories is a humble, compassionate man, saddened by the flaws in human nature that force us to commit crimes. Kenneth More plays him as a sarcastic, dismissive character who is hardly ever polite or warm to people. Very 'un-priestly' and certainly not the mild-mannered Father of the Chesterton stories.",1317772800,,389,4.909090909090909
2815390,1,B000PC6YUS,"Set 2 was so disappointing I threw them out after watching them once.  This was very suprising to me because Set 1 is excellent!  In Set 1 the quality of the story is worth 5 stars.  In Set 2 the quality of the stories is worth 1 star.  In Set 1 the stories are captivating and very interesting.  In Set 2 they are hokey.  Why the drop off in quality, I do not know.",1267142400,3,366,3.8783783783783785
2815391,5,B000PC6YUS,We enjoy very much Father Brown's techniques in solving various mysteries. British acting is crisp and clean. Truly family enjoyment.,1238025600,4,133,5.7
2815392,1,B000PC6YUS,"As I loved the Father Dowling series I thought this would be of a similar
quality. Very dissapointed. The sets were cheap and dark and the dialogue
rather mundane. I do like Kenneth Moore but he was let down by a poor script and unintersting stories. Sorry, definetely not my cuppa1

2815395,3,B000PC6YUS,"I started watching these to tide me over until David Suchet's Poirot returns for his final bows.

I pretty much agree with another reviewer here that the stories move a little too fast sometimes, and you find yourself wondering how Father Brown figured things out.  A couple of the stories are not very good, but there is one very clever one set in a London theater house that I enjoyed.

I also think that anyone who complains about production values ought to remember that these were shot in the early 1970s and remember that any television show from that era will look much less polished and ""real"" than the stuff we get nowadays.

Bottom line:  I probably will buy the next volume of Father Brown stories if there are any more.  But I think I will try to get the next set used.",1188777600,10,781,4.426573426573427

2815404,5,B000PC6YUS,"This is the second of two DVD box sets of the ""Father Brown"" British TV series from the 1970s. Like many other Acorn Media DVD releases of old television shows, the packaging consists of a box with two DVD keep cases inside, with three or four hourlong episodes on each of the two discs. Having seen the BBC's slick new ""Father Brown"" series with Mark Williams on PBS, I'm surprised to admit that I much prefer this older series. Unlike the Williams version, these older episodes with Kenneth More stick closely to the original GK Chesterton short stories, and even the divergences from Chesterton's original novel are done more for the sake of visualization than for the sake of creative rewriting. Where the Mark Williams series uses Chesterton's stories more as a general framework for launching wholly original plots and dialogue, this show maintains the elegant wordplay and moral-deductive reasoning of Chesterton's original stories. Kenneth More plays Father Brown closer the style of Chesterton's eccentric priest-detective than Williams, who comes across in the new series as more of a generic amateur sleuth. With his absentminded asides and brilliant facial expressions, More nails the abstracted and seemingly meaningless flights of reasoning that often carry the titular priest to brilliant solutions of murder cases. Where the new ""Father Brown"" reduces characters and plot elements to the most generic possible interpretations, giving us lots of people rifling through desks, this older show takes greater care over the actual mysteries, focusing more on plot than on the slick editing and visuals of the Williams version. While this older program has a cheaper look than the new show, it is more intelligent and more faithful to the literary source material, and it offers a surprising number of distinguished British guest stars like Bernard Lee of James Bond fame. As Chesterton conceived it after meeting a real-life priest who knew more about practical matters than he did, Father Brown is an unassuming parish priest in 1920s Britain who grasps worldly matters better than he lets on and who invariably deduces the solutions of murder mysteries through his brilliant moral insights into the natures of different people. The central paradox of Father Brown, evident in More's subtle interpretation, is that his Catholicism makes him far less superstitious and far more level-headed than many people allegedly freed of religious superstitions. There's very little of this characterization in the bland Mark Williams show, but Kenneth More presents it in spades. If you're a fan of the original stories, this the Father Brown to see.",1382227200,9,2651,5.24

Gilbert Keith Chesterton wrote fifty-one short stories in the early twentieth century. Father Ignatius Brown is a parish priest and also an amateur detective whose observations and psychological insights are used to unravel mysteries. Chesterton was a master of paradox (truth standing on its head to attract attention) with his witty stories. He was inspired by a remark about priests, where auricular confessions can reveal many crimes to a parish priest who learns about the sins of people. Fr. Brown is a most unlikely detective compared to other detectives of fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe, Hercule Poirot, etc.). These stories are taken from the five volumes of short stories.

1) The Actor and the Alibi. Fr. Brown searches for a runaway girl. This leads to a theater company with conflicts among the actors.
