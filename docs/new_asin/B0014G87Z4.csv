It is also one of the movies that you'll want to watch multiple times with your friends.  And your friends will think you're really cool for finding this amazing movie that they didn't know about.

8255666,5,B0014G87Z4,Absolutely hilarious!! So many classic lines you'll repeat them for days! Time flew & left me wanting more... It is now part of my DVD collection.,1209168000,2,146,4.653846153846154
8255667,5,B0014G87Z4,"This was a great independent film.  I've seen it twice, and can't wait to get the DVD to watch it with the commentaries and all the behind the scenes stuff.
  To begin with, the film is hilarious.  The cast shows some great comedic timing with the delivery of the lines.  I guess, you'd have to give credit to the script for that, and the writers did a phenomenal job.
  The filmmakers also put together a pretty impressive film on a very small budget.  Let's hope when the Hollywood remake comes out they don't screw this thing up!  Unless, one of the original directors remakes it again on a larger budget (that may be a possibility as I hear Nick Schwartz, one of the directors, is now working with Martin Landau on his upcoming project).
  Overall, just a really fun movie that in purchasing would be supporting independent film making.",1205539200,,840,4.570469798657718
8255668,5,B0014G87Z4,"As the other Co-Director of this film, my review is also bound to be overwhelmingly positive, but I will be honest and fair with my praise and/or criticism of this movie.
As a send-up of over-the-top horror and action films, The Blood Grinder succeeds as both a comedy and a drama.  Parodying a specific genre's conventions (and not a specific film) allows the humor in this film to be universally appealing to anyone who has ever seen a horror or action film before.  While some of the humor may get lost on certain audiences (and much of it is not appropriate for younger audiences), the film throws so many jokes out one after another that many of them are bound to hit hard, regardless of who you are.  It may push buttons, but it is all tongue-in-cheek, and the movie never takes itself too seriously, though there are a few serious moments that succeed in lending the film a fairly professional sense of pacing, if I do say so myself.
Furthermore, for a nearly no-budget picture, this feature-length film really looks incredible.  An awful lot of work was put in to this film, and it shines through in the final product.
While there may be nothing like seeing this movie with a packed theater of laughing viewers, it still holds up remarkably on a smaller screen.
If you do purchase this film, you will be supporting independent filmmaking, and you will be getting a hilarious and seriously fun movie that stands up to many repeat viewings.",1204675200,2,1446,4.63671875

8255670,5,B0014G87Z4,"Seeing as how I am one of the directors of this movie, it seems a bit unfair of me to review it, since obviously I think it's the greatest movie ever created by human hands. However, I can at least give you an honest list of reasons why I think you would like this movie.

1. It's very funny. The movie is a very tongue-in-cheek parody in the vein of Airplane or Naked Gun. My co-director Nick Schwartz and I were admittedly worried about reaching an audience with our unique style, but we're happy to say that we have created something that people have absolutely loved (or at least have been very good at pretending to love).

2. You would be supporting independent filmmakers. Nick and I made this movie on a shoestring budget, but it's still something we're extremely proud of. Our hope is to be the guys making the movies you go out to see in a few years, and every single fan is important to us.

3. Hey, it's not too expensive!

So, I can't force you to buy this movie, but I can at least say with confidence that I think if you give it a shot, you will not be disappointed. And at $15, you don't have too much to lose. Anyway, thank you for viewing, I hope you buy and love the movie as much as the rest of the ever-expanding fanbase has!
