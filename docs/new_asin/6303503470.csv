7849226,4,6303503470,"This film by maverick filmmaker Shirley Clarke (THE COOL WORLD) gets its power by its sheer simplicity.  A group of jazz musicians await their drug ""connection"" inside a seedy New York City apartment while being filmed for a documentary.  Set entirely in one room of the apartment, THE CONNECTION effectively creates a very claustrophobic feel.  The viewer feels like someone awkwardly eavesdropping on the lives of people on the fringes of society.
THE CONNECTION features many fine performances.  Carl Lee (THE COOL WORLD) plays one of the few aggressive black men seen on screen during the early 1960's.  He plays Cowboy, the ""Connection"" indicated by the title.  He also has one of the film's best lines with: ""Man, I believe anything that's illegal is illegal because it makes more money for more people that way.""
Roscoe Lee Browne (narrator of BABE: PIG IN THE CITY) makes his feature film debut in the role of J. J. Burden, the  documentary cinematographer who also provides narration for the film.  Warren Finnerty (EASY RIDER) gives a hyper performance as ""Leach,"" the ""host"" of the gathering.  Watching him, you'll swear that current indie favorite, Steve Buscemi (FARGO) is a reincarnation of him.  Finnerty won an Obie award for his performance in the play.
In its own way, THE CONNECTION rivals the recent commercial and critical favorite TRAFFIC in how it forces the viewer to examine his or her attitudes about illegal drug use.  More importantly, it does this without the latter film's use of visual gimmickry or tricks.  As an added bonus, check out Freddie Redd's jazz score.  He performs it on camera along with Jackie McLean (sax), Larry Richie (drums) and Michael Mattos (bass).  If you're looking for something gritty and raw in sharp contrast to 1960's Hollywood, you need to look no further.",988848000,9,1816,4.990033222591362
7849227,5,6303503470,"As another reviewer notes, this film IS dated. It deals with the in-fighting among a group of junkies being filmed by a documentary filmmaker and his assistant, who are gradually drawn into the action themselves, until the moment where the aloof, arrogant filmmaker is compelled to pick up the needle himself... Based on a Living Theatre play, THE CONNECTION does a wonderful job turning this core material into the stuff of self-reflexive cinema, dispensing with any sense that it was written for another media. It's a critique of a position not much advocated these days anyhow -- the cinema verite supposition that film can objectively document reality -- and calls for artists to become committed, to assume responsibility for the role they play, for their own subjective biases, etc. That's a moral concern that puts it, for me, on the shelf more with DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY than SHADOWS (which that other reviewer compared it to), but let's ignore that for the time being. Suffice it to say that it's a concern OF THE TIME. No one asks questions nowadays about what film is or should be, or talks about the commitment of the artist, though, uh, perhaps they SHOULD. But yes, then -- the movie is dated. The other count on which the film can be said to be dated is the portrayal of junkies themselves -- the characters in this film behave more like they stepped out of a beat poet's imagination than a NYC slum, are far more articulate and introspective than most real junkies are likely to get, even artsy ones. All that said, I think this is a stunning movie, which, while speaking from a given time and perspective, manages to do some very thought-provoking things. It's a shame it's not more widely used in cinema courses and such; in terms of works that question cinema, and seek to challenge a too-easy acceptance of how the world is constructed by film, THE CONNECTION is as interesting as REAR WINDOW, PEEPING TOM, or any other classics of film-about-film, partially because it foregrounds it's theme much more explicitly (the junkies give the filmmaker ample criticism about his attitude). And YES, the jazz is good, but, in my book, it's secondary.",984009600,2,2162,4.814516129032258
7849228,4,6303503470,"The movie itself is incredibly dated, but the music that is featured throughout is some of the best jazz of that era that you will ever see. This is Freddie Redd's group, but it's Jackie McLean's alto playing that steals the show. The film itself will remind you of one of Cassavetes early films, think Shadows, but it's the music that will make it priceless. Docked a star for the actual film that interrupts those great tunes.",975110400,5,428,4.571428571428571
