6060936,5,B00G575Q0Q,This is a fun yet challenging workout. I am 60 years old and able to follow along at my own pace. I love all Gilad workouts having exercised with the tv show when I was younger. It's good to know I can still keep up with Gilad!,1397433600,3,227,3.851063829787234

8620830,5,B00G575Q0Q,"Item came fast delivery, just as described.  I really enjoy working out with Gilad for many years, he is easy to follow and the routine is the perfect amount of time average 23 minutes long.  You do feel your muscles working and if you keep it up regularly you will see definition.",1482364800,,281,4.384615384615385
8620831,5,B00G575Q0Q,Gilad never disappoints. I have enjoyed his workouts for years.,1473033600,,63,5.4
8620832,3,B00G575Q0Q,"I came back to working out with Gilad, because his DVD's were the same thing we did in the 80's and early 90's. The stuff that worked.

There is a warm up, a short aerobic section to get your body working and burning fat and calories and the old school floor exercises. Inner thigh, hips, butt, and abs. The first of each workout had an upper body workout.

These are the exercises that kept us Americans in shape. Remember those days? Firm butts, abs, inner and outer thighs? The workouts weren't so hard on your body that you couldn't exercise every single day. Plus, at only 25 minutes a session, they fit in.

All of this is why I very recently (in the last month) came back to Gilad and was loving his DVD's.

Then...I bought the express workout DVD. OK, but no something to do daily on it's own. There is only one and so you are doing the very same workout, using only a limited amount of muscle groups ever single time, and they are part of his newer. Combo exercises that follow the latest trend at the time of exercises.

Then...I got bored and wanted more, so I bought this DVD. Gah! I am totally not thrilled. If I wanted to do modern, I'd workout with Ann Jillian. You know, fast, hard on your body and not really working any part like it should, because you are standing up for the workouts and are working super fast. Let me emphasis, super fast. Even in my younger days, working out at this speed did nothing but pull muscles and cause pain. Which over time let  up to the some of the multiple surgeries I have had from exercise injuries. Honestly, I thought that Gilad had skipped all the junk trends and stuck with his true self, but now I see that isn't right.

Luckily, I only ordered one of these instead of the several I had in my shopping cart.

I can't send this DVD back, because it's opened, However, I can stick it on the shelf and never use it again!  I'll be going back to has original 80's stuff and fight the boredom that comes from having to do the same few workouts over and over, because with Those DVD's I was seeing results. Less back pain, stronger hips and thighs and best of all, my abs and oblique's were actually gaining shape again. (I'm 57, and this isn't easy at my
Age).

Please think about what it is when you are thinking of buying his workouts. Do you want the more modern trend workouts that have done nothing for you so you keep coming back to buy something different all the while getting flabbier, or do you want what kept you in shape when you worked out with him on TV?  For me, it's the television shows. The commercials have been edited out and you get only the workout. I'm no longer into the 'No pain, no gain"" trend. Believe me. It WILL cause you physical problems later in your life!",1471305600,,2742,4.294573643410852
8620833,3,B00G575Q0Q,Little effort made to produce a quality DVD here. Commercials have been deleted...but that workout time was not filled with the exercise and time that took place during the commercials!,1465344000,,185,5.2
8620834,5,B00G575Q0Q,"I used to work out with Gilad when he was popular on ESPN in the early 90's.  These are recorded episodes from these televised series.  Total Body Sculpt is more recent - probably from 10 years ago, and the workouts really show results!  There are three 25-minute episodes which can easily fit into my schedule.  I like that his exercises really focus on thighs and butt which is what I need.  Light weights are recommended to use with this DVD.",1455667200,,445,4.5125
8620835,5,B00G575Q0Q,Can't get enough Gilad.  His workouts helped make me strong again after a recent surgery.  Losing inches and weight.,1432166400,,116,5.052631578947368
8620836,5,B00G575Q0Q,Great as always,1430265600,,15,4.333333333333333
8620837,5,B00G575Q0Q,"Soon as I saw more of Gilad's DVD's being available i bought them all!  Since his shows are no longer available on TV, now I can workout to his sessions any time my heart desires!",1427414400,4,179,4.114285714285714
