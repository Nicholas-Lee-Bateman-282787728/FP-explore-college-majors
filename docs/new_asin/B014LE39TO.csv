8731312,5,B014LE39TO,"The latest dvd release from Undercrank Productions truly delivers the goods with a collection of extremely rare films from former child actress from the silent film era, Diana Serra Cary, better known today as Baby Peggy. Cary (who is still with us today) made a string of two reel comedies and features from the early to mid 20s for Century and Universal, has been unseen for over nine decades due to neglect from the studio that released her films as most of her film work is considered lost today. This new release presents one of Carey's feature length film and to very rare comedy shorts from the early 20s. The melodrama, THE FAMILY SECRET ('24) is a perfect introduction to Carey as you will instantly fall in love with her in this warm heartfelt feature. Film historians have considered the Fox Sunshine Comedies as the ""holy grail"" of silent film comedies, but the Century Comedies can also be used in that category. Founded by the Stern Brothers the Centuries featured top notch talent including Cary. Two of the Century Comedies are given a ligit dvd release on this collection, CIRCUS CLOWNS ('22) and MILES OF SMILES ('22) are two beautifully restored prints from MoMA and The Library of congress are prime examples on how Cary easily handled the fast paced slapstick brand of comedy for a very young age and the first short features one of the forgotten animal stars, BROWNIE THE DOG that assists Carey. Also included is a couple newsreel like shorts of Carey with her family in SCREEN SNAPSHOTS ('21) and SCREEN ALMANAC ('24).Once again the the wonderful musical scores are provided by Ben Model and all of the prints look amazing and sharp. I highly recommend this special dvd edition to fans of classic silent cinema as you won't be disappointed.",1456617600,,1763,4.783606557377049

8731314,5,B014LE39TO,"Baby Peggy, known today as Diana Serra Cary, is shown in these three films as a wonderful young actress with great charm, humor and screen presence.  The two rare shorts, Circus Clowns and Miles of Smiles are very entertaining and I hope more of Peggy's other shorts will be located.  In the feature, The Family Secret, Peggy and the rest of the cast get the chance to convey both comic and more dramatic scenes and they are very accomplished.  It's great to see Peggy's films being so lovingly restored and with such fine accompaniment by Ben Model.  Thanks to all involved.",1448064000,,575,4.663366336633663

Cast, director, writers and crew have provided value for all generations; some scenes capturing essence of humankind in a way that films rendered in later technologies may have never matched. A treasure; compliments to Ms. Cary and thanks to those who undertook to restore and release this wonderful film.",1446940800,3,334,5.203703703703703

8731318,5,B014LE39TO,"""The Family Secret"" is a fine film in all regards. William Seiter (who also helmed the recently released Colleen Moore film ""Why Be Good?"") does a great job as director, and star Baby Peggy carries the film - despite being only 4 years old! That kid has star quality! Undercrank Productions restoration is superb, and the musical accompaniment is excellent.",1445385600,6,357,4.966666666666667
