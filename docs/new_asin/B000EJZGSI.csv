8110760,4,B000EJZGSI,I viewed the demo once and intend to return to it periodically in the future.  The one drawback (to any video) is that I normally exercise outside and a video doesn't help during the sessions.,1363737600,,192,4.485714285714286
8110761,3,B000EJZGSI,"I thought this video would take me through a basic kettlebell workout. Instead, it's a detailed discussion of perfect form for 6 exercises.  It has the feel of YouTube videos that were turned into a DVD.  I think the instruction is great, even if the delivery is a little flat, but I'm not sure I would have paid $25 for it if I knew what I was getting. Kettlebell Lifting I & II could have been easily combined into one video, and then it might have been worth the price.",1274400000,5,472,4.233333333333333
8110762,4,B000EJZGSI,Basically delivers as it claims with easy to follow instuctions on how to use the kettle bell.,1272585600,,94,4.588235294117647
8110763,5,B000EJZGSI,Excellent DVD for starting Kettlebell training. Instructor explains the lifts clearly and precisely and also demonstrates. Actually starts where you should start........the beginning. Have had other dvd's that actually start you off with advanced lifts without mastering the basics first. Nicely priced. Very happy with this purchase. Also purchased the second dvd with more advanced lifts but have not watched yet.,1236902400,7,415,5.819672131147541
8110764,4,B000EJZGSI,This was my first purchase of a Kettlebell workout DVD. It was as advertised. The exercises were explained and demonstrated in a clear understandable fashion. No complaints!,1229817600,7,173,5.444444444444445
8110765,5,B000EJZGSI,"I hadn't heard of Gregg and Kerry before I purchased the DVD, but I am glad, no make that VERY glad I purchased it. It is well instructed, demonstrated and Greeg is very, very thorough in his instruction of the internal and externals of the basic lifts, the deadlift, swings, squats, cleans, presses, and snatches.

Very well done and I cannot recommend it Highly enough.

This is one to add to your libray (imho)",1210291200,16,413,4.5675675675675675
