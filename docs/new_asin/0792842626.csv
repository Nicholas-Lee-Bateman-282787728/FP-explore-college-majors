151417,5,0792842626,"I was introduced to this film in my German class, although I had thought to check it out years before after seeing it recommended in Seventeen Magazine.  Since then I have seen it more times than I can count because I always end up telling my friends to watch it, and then we end up watching it together because I don't want anyone to lose it (and I do loan out all my other videos).
This is a TRUE story of incredible luck (so incredible as to be quite unbelievable) and pluck through a very dark time in history.  If it weren't for so many coincidences, Solomon Perel would not be around to tell his amazing story.
You might recognize Julie Delpy (who plays Leni, the Nazi girlfriend) from French flims such as ""White"" and American films such as ""Before Sunrise"" and ""An American Werewolf in Paris"".  She does a fine job here, as does the handsome young Marco Hofschneider in his role as Solly.  (What other films is he in and where can I get them?, I sometimes ask myself...)
If you are trying to learn German, watch it first with the subtitles, and then on the second viewing, try taping some paper over the subtitles on your tv screen (of course you should take the paper off during the part in Russian, unless of course you also happen to be studying Russian).  If you are at least an intermediate German student, you will gain a lot from such a viewing.  The language is clearly spoken, and not overly difficult.  I have done this several times myself, and have found it incredibly helpful.
There are a couple of scenes that may be offensive to sensitive people, and if you think of showing it in an American classroom, those are the parts you'll be forced to fast forward... (my German teacher found this out the hard way, but fortunatly there were only 4 of us in the class, and none of us complained).
Overall, very highly recommended!",972518400,70,1845,4.456973293768546

The one weakness of the DVD that I own is that the soundtrack is slightly misaligned in a few places.  This is only slightly annoying, since most of us will be reading subtitles and not watching mouths, but hopefully editors will match the voices with lips more accurately in future editions.

151524,3,0792842626,"EUROPA, EUROPA, 1990.  This rare World War II holocaust comedy/drama tells an unlikely and ironic tale.  Salomon Perel, a handsome German Jewish boy of 13, finds himself in Poland, separated from his family, in the early days of WWII.  He is taken into a Soviet orphanage, where he becomes a member of the Komsomol, the Soviet youth organization.  He is then captured by the Germans.  He changes his name, poses as a German orphan, is valued for his translating skills and then is declared to have single-handedly captured a nest of Soviet soldiers.  He is thereafter considered a 'war hero' and eventually made a Hitler Youth. He tries merely to survive the war: it seems inevitable that he will be discovered.  Especially when a gay German officer and a rabidly anti-Semitic young girlfriend seem much too close to the goods.  Improbabilities and happenstance are the basis of this history, yet it is true, based upon Perel's autobiography.

Perel plays himself as an older man; Marco Hofschneider turns in remarkable work as the young protagonist.  The Warsaw-born Agnieszka Holland, who trained in Prague, directed.  The lovely French actress Julie Delphy, (BEFORE SUNSET, BEFORE SUNRISE, BEFORE MIDNIGHT, TWO DAYS IN PARIS), 30ish at the time, plays 15 year old Leni, who wants Perel to father her Aryan child, while she wishes she could cut the throats of Jews.  This is a small film, dealing with the darkest of subject matter, which might well be unbearable, were it not lightened by flashes of - still dark-toned--humor.

151576,4,0792842626,"This is an amazing, true story of Solomon Perel, a German Jew who managed to survive the Holocaust by first convincing the Russians that he was a dedicated comnunist, and thus actually does in fact become so dedicated to comnunism that his devotion cannot be swayed for a period, even by his comrads who had been part of it from probably their earliest years. After he learns the Russians have been defeated by the Nazi's, he defects and is discovered by Nazi's who accuse him of being a Jew. He cunningly convinces them that he is actually a German. They believe him and he is quickly embraced by the German army. He then dedicates himself to the causes of the national socialist movement and becomes a member of the Hitler youth. The moments of the film that take place within his participation with the Hilter youth are my favorite moments of the film. During this period in his life the Nazi's proclaim him a war hero. Solomon Perel, as portrayed in the film is someone you almost despise. He hardly seems to be a heroic person by nature, and in fact is easily swayed by the political parties he joins even though he is ultimately hiding the truth that he is a Jew. Obviously he is only doing what he can to survive what ever the cost, even if he betrays his own heroism and his own race of people. There are moments that he is forced to defend his own blood, though he is always one step from being discovered for what he truly is- a Jew. There are many moments of superbly crafted authentism, and the film as a whole deserves a place in history at a minimal level as a classic. On the other hand, what few images of war are present, the film takes a hit because these segments are not very realistic at all and seem amaturish to some degree. But these moments are not what this film is about anyway. A believable look inside the Hitler youth and their brainwashing techniques, and the belief system of comnunism come across nicely in this film.

The nudity is both male and female due to Concentration Camps. The lead actor is seen partially nude in several scenes of the movie. Do not let these warnings prevent you from watching it.

He looked NOTHING like the almost-superboy-looking actor (resembles the kid from the tv series) who portrayed him. And, well, that kinda broke the bubble and confused the true story for me. The real Solomon actually looked quite Jewish to ME--like a cousin to me--and I can't see how he fooled the Nazis, but, OK, he did.

151597,5,0792842626,"Most Holocaust films focus on the horrors of the death camps or devolve into clich-ridden war films.  Polish director, Agnieszka Holland`s `Europa, Europa` is one of the few that dares to present a different side.  `Europa, Europa`s` originality lies in its devastating ability to show what it meant to survive as a Jewish person inside the Third Reich.

Solomon Perel`s story is as incredulous as it is moving.  Youngest son of a German-Jewish family, he escapes the vandalism and murder of Kristalnacht (his sister does not) and migrates with his family to Lodz, Poland where they naively believe they will be safe from harm.  Then, September 1939 arrives and Poland exists no more, eviscerated by two tyrants. Solomon`s father sends him and his brother as far east as possible.  Reaching Soviet Poland, Solly becomes a Komosol member and embraces Bolshevism as the best way to survive.  Yet, safety is not to be as Hitler soon invades Stalin`s Empire.  Joining the refugee flotsam streaming eastward, Solly is soon apprehended by the advancing Germans.  Since Nazi policy was to immediately exterminate all Jewish prisoners, Solly uses his perfect German to escape detection.  Pretending to be a Volksdeutsch (German living outside the Reich), Solly once again embraces his new found masters in order to survive.  He joins a Wehrmacht unit and despite attempting to escape is sent to a Hitler Youth school in Germany as a reward for his courage.  Here, Solly endures his most tortuous of days as any lapse in vigilance could instantly betray his Jewish origins.  Finally, Allied bombs and the Soviet advance free Solly from his hellish prison.

Such is Solomon Perel`s incredible story and Holland`s amazing film manages to capture Solly`s head spinning peregrinations without ever lapsing into monotony.  Each step of Solomon`s miraculous life is documented with color and drama. A sense of impending doom accompanies Solly`s every move.  Will he be found out and when?  Holland`s film masterfully captures the maddening paranoia that must have gripped every European Jew in hiding.  The cost of living a lie in order to survive is shown in excruciating detail.  Solly knows his Achilles` heel is his circumcision and goes to absurd lengths to hide it.  He avoids intimacy with his girlfriend at the Nazi school and even tries to stretch back his foreskin in a near-tragic experiment.

When a German soldier befriends Solly and discovers his `difference,`he refuses to turn him.  The film shows that while National Socialism infected German society as a whole, not everybody was corrupted by its poison.  The German soldier feels a kinship with Solomon.  A homosexual, the soldier himself has had to hide his true self in order to escape the concentration camps. `Europa, Europa` captures the essence of what it means to betray one`s self in order to survive.

Moreover, Holland`s film shows just how monolithically racist a society the Nazis succeeded in creating.  Neighbors attack Solomon`s family on Kristalnacht, and yet, a neighbor girl is the only one who helps Solly after the attack.  Holland juxtaposes the individual humanity of a few with the collective madness of the rest.  It is this collective madness that the film so tellingly portrays.  While at his Nazi school, Solly must learn the fundamentals of `racial science.`  As the fanatic teacher takes calipers to Solly`s head, the young students gawk in fear and awe.  Scenes such as these show just how profoundly German children were brainwashed by Nazi ideology.

Marco Hofschneider`s portrayal of Solomon is full of pathos and sensitivity. His performance highlights the psychological costs of Solomon`s double life.  In her portrayal as Solly`s girlfriend at the Hitler Youth school, Julie Delpy shows presence and believability as an arrogant youth thoroughly poisoned by the lies of Nazi ideology.  In fact, all the roles in this remarkable film are played with a rare accuracy and attention to detail.  `Europa, Europa` is a powerful film that will help the viewer better understand what life was like for those caught in the insanity of Hitler`s Third Reich.",1294876800,4,4137,5.133034379671151

151600,5,0792842626,"EUROPA, EUROPA is one of the most tender stories to come out of the films that deal with WW II. Based on the autobiographical book by Solomon Perel and adapted for the screen by Paul Hengge and director Agnieszka Holland it is a tale of how far a child will go to honor his promise to his father to survive.  Solomon Perel (Marco Hofschneider) is a young Jewish boy when the war breaks out and as the Jews are being gathered for deportation to the camps, his father makes him promise he will do anything to survive.  And survive he does - by adopting the personage of a German Aryan (non-Jew), even to the point of spending days physically trying to reverse his telltale circumcision.  He becomes involved with the Hitler's Youth, adopts the life of a Nazi and, despite a few slips with people who discover his identity, he manages to survive the war.  He not only survives but also falls in love with a perfect German girl Leni (Judy Delphy), excels in the school for Hitler's Youth, and is so popular that even the commandant wants to adopt him. But in time the war is over and he goes to the concentration camps looking for his family.  The measure of despair and joy that happen as he reunites with his brother is one of those memorable moments in time.

Marco Hoschneider is exceptional in this film, but much of the success of the movie goes to the director Agnieszka Holland who manages to find juts the right amount of harsh reality and lighten it with moments of human frailty to make the film wholly credible.  Composer Zbigniew Preisner provides the atmospheric and memorable musical score.  Grady Harp, 2010",1279843200,,1619,4.558620689655172
151601,5,0792842626,"Salomon Perel's war story is all the more unsettling for being true. Directed by the Polish Jewish director, Agnieszka Holland in 1991. Salomon(Solly)Perel(Marco Hofschneider) is a young German Jew,whose father is a Polish Jewish shop-keeper living in Germany with his family. There is a Pogrom against Jews on Kristallnacht,Solly and his brother Isaak,flee east into Poland. His circumcision is shown at the start of the film and will be the defining event in his identity. Solly gets split up from his brother and ends up in a Russian orphanage in Grodno,where he learns to be a fervent young Stalinist infatuated by his tutor. He becomes a model Komsomol and learns to speak Russian. He spouts indoctrination like `Religion is the opium of the masses'.

With the German invasion of Russia the school is uprooted and moves east,he gets separated and becomes a young German to the German soldiers,an interpreter who usefully speaks Russian for his unit,known as Joseph(Jupp) Peters,a favourite of the German soldiers. His ethnicity becomes known to a homosexual German soldier but he keeps it secret. He becomes an accidental hero after all his unit are killed and he surrenders to the Russians,only to find out that it's the Russians surrendering to him,with the German army behind him. The Commanding officer wants to adopt him and wants to send his `son' to one of the best German military schools,an elite youth academy. He falls for lovely,Jew-hating Aryan lass,Leni(Julie Delphy).But by this point the effort of hiding behind so many masks,not to mention hiding the most tangible physical evidence of his identity,is beginning to take its toll.

The film covers the absurdity of adapting to every changing event and yet the need to to survive at all costs. Ironies bite hard and occasional farcical moments add an unsettling edge to Perel's fortunes,e.g. in the class about Aryan racial superiority,when Solly is judged as not pure Aryan,but `Aryan enough'.This shows up racist pseudo-science. He also makes friends where he can,even with Germans who are anti-semitic. Perel is ambivalent towards all these people,Communist or Nazi,his chameleon-like skills bring him among. The film does not evade the horrors,but it alludes to the Holocaust only obliquely. There is no time  to reflect or moments of conscience. Perel's brief but chilling glimpse of the Lodz ghetto is all the grimmer for being set against his picaresque, spirited progress. The real Solly is shown at the end  as he is now in Israel,singing a song. This film covers a lot of history with a light touch.",1275264000,,2579,5.118764845605701

The film offers us glimpses into these three very different worlds and the author , while sharing his tragic losses and his hiding from all who are close to him, gives us glimpses of compassion even among the Nazis and the hard-line Communists of Stalin's Russia. There are instances of rare humor and if the question of keeping one's foreskin has never seemed to be of much importance, there is something  here of  both tragedy and humor in the simple matter of urinating around other guys.

151646,5,0792842626,"If it were not for the fact that the real Solomon Perel appears towards the end of Europa Europa, I would be tempted to believe this film was fiction.  It seems too unlikely that a Jewish boy could survive World War II, first as a good Soviet, then as a good Nazi, without being discovered.  But apparently it happened, and this film does an excellent job of depicting the extraordinary story.

Solomon Perel was on the eve of his bar mitzvah when his world was shattered.  A pogrom in his German hometown in the late 1930s killed his sister and forced his family to flee to Poland.  There they were once more endangered when Germany invaded Poland in September, 1939.  Solomon is separated from his family, ends up in a Soviet orphanage where he becomes a good Marxist, then through a series of bizarre twists and turns he becomes a hero of the Third Reich and is sent to an elite Hitler Youth school where he's praised as an excellent example of Aryan superiority.

Now as a Jewish male Solomon has a major problem keeping the physical evidence of his religion hidden from those who are sworn to exterminate him.  He manages it through a series of coincidences and evasions that are blackly humorous.  Eventually his sense of who he and his family truly are returns, and he begins the long process of re-identifying himself.

The film is beautifully presented and manages to give a fuller sense of the horror of the Holocaust much better than many more graphic depictions.",1239062400,4,1474,4.634615384615385

151650,5,0792842626,"I adore European films (German, Russian, Hungarian) and so I was really anxious to get my hands on `Hitlerjunge Salomon' (also known as `Europa Europa').  The film is gloriously shot, with beautifully engaging cinematography; from claustrophobic indoor sets to vastly luminous outdoor cascades, but it is the engaging story itself that will leave you more than spellbound.  `Europa Europa' is a true story that is as tragic as it is uplifting as we watch this young man struggle to survive in a cold world bent on his destruction.

`Europa Europa' tells us the story of young Salomon `Solly' Perel who is separated from his family during the Holocaust.  Solly and his brother Isaak are separated while trying to flee to Poland.  In order to spare his life, young Solly poses as a German and joins the German army.  He becomes a war hero and is accepted into the Hitler Youth.  He becomes everything he knows he should loathe in order to save himself, and this transformation takes its toll on the man he is slowly becoming.  As he forms relationships with individuals who would kill him if they only knew, Solly is constantly guarded, never allowing anyone to really get inside of his soul; and this barrier begins to rot away at the core of this young man.

The film as a whole reminds me somewhat of `The Pianist' in its ability to truly move a person.  It is a courageous tale of the triumph of spirit and survival, and young Marco Hofschneider is miraculously moving (as was Adrian Brody).

Hofschneider marvelously shifts between his characters emotional state, allowing us to see him for who he truly is, and not the guarded faade he puts up for those around him.  We never lose sight of the fact that Solly is but a boy, really, but we also see how his dire situations age him drastically.  His fragile movements, subtle and powerful, cause our own emotions to stir.  The actors around Hofschneider all do their best to elevate his performance, but in the end they all take a backseat to his brilliance.

It's really no wonder the Academy nominated this film for Adapted Screenplay; it's only a shame that German didn't submit the film for `foreign picture' for I'm sure it would have won the Oscar.

Much like `The Pianist', `Europa Europa' feels as though it will never reach its uplifting conclusion, but it does, and when it does we are left with such a warm and blessed feeling in our souls.  The film is glorious from start to finish, depicting the horrors of war and the effect it has on our youth (the character of young Leni alone is a tragic warning of what war is doing to our children) as well as the touching realities of family and that everlasting bond between blood.  There are few films that can truly inspire with such effortless ease, and `Europa Europa' is a dynamic example of how effective good filmmaking can be.",1223856000,9,2842,4.65

Particularly touching for me was that of Amanda Haley who had watched the film with Solomon Perel. The others who gave it five stars have said more than I can in few words, i.e. ""it's absolutely wonderful"". What distressed me more than any scene of Nazi cruelty in the film were the various commentaries of those who trashed the entire movie.
I'm not Jewish, but again am reminded of the anti-Semitism still thriving in American society...dear to those who deny the existence of their own dark Shadow, according to psychoanalyst Carl Jung, and hence foment the hatred we all claim to decry.
""Europa, Europa"" is NOT a documentary. Would we have watched a very important story without the dramatic and emotionally laden moments? I've seen both ""Schindler's List"" and the documentary on Schindler. Both are  very similar and authentic. Why then did the movie touch me more than the latter? The art of cinema is to make those elements of truth resound in our own psyches, and I highly commend Director Holland for shaking us to the core with one of the most important movies ever done on the Holocaust.",1190160000,3,1190,4.776699029126213

A valorous and worthy to mention anecdote that shows us even in the most horrid and hopeless moments the human soul always finds an occasion to survive.

As a curious fact, the title of this film matched with the film of Lars von Triers, and that was the reason why Europe of the Danish director was modified by Zentropa.",1190073600,2,641,4.62280701754386

It may seem incredible and almost unbelievable, but if you happen to read true accounts by other Holocaust survivors, you will find that the incredible and miraculous plays a significant role in saving these victims of Nazi propaganda from certain death.

I think that mirror scene, in particular, summed up what the movie was about--that is, a young boy who was trapped in an awful and dangerous situation. The movie is quite explicit in some parts, but I think the explicitness helped the viewer to get a ""closer"" sense of what Solek was experiencing. The final sentences of the narration could've been cut from the movie--because it makes the movie seem like it ended abruptly--but otherwise everything else was quite good.",1163808000,2,777,4.762962962962963

151753,4,0792842626,"""Europa Europa"" is an unusual movie that caught me a little off guard.  I didn't know whether to take it as an above-average war movie or a unique approach to view multiple perspectives of WWII.  I'm sure the latter was the purpose for the writer and director but I'm still shaking my head at the many twists and turns that our hero had to take.  I won't spoil the movie by trying to tell too much but ""Jupp"" saves himself from the Nazi's by joining them.  The many near misses keep us in suspense and the many different hats that Jupp wears gives us an inside look at the mindsets of the victims and agressors.

What challenged me most about ""Europa Europa"" was what to think of Jupp.  Is he a hero or a traitor?  We are given ample evidence to consider.  The movie does a good job of looking at the best and worst of the various groups although it is clear that those blinded by anti-semitism are the bad guys.  However, there were ""good Germans"" that garnered our respect and sympathy (more victims of the Nazis).

Jupp got caught up in something he couldn't control despite his guardian angel.  However, as he weaves himself through this amazing maze, we might be excused for wanting him to take a stand and, if only for a brief moment, make a difference.  In essence, for me, the strength of the movie is also its' weakness.  Jupp could not survive by being a hero; he could only survive by being a victim",1145404800,9,1410,4.376923076923077

He is sent back to Germany a hero and enrolls in a Nazi-ruled school. His biggest problem, and the movie's funniest, is that he's circumsized, of course, and how he has to hide the fact. The horrors of the war, especially the brutality meted out against the Jews, are neatly, almost miraculously, balanced against this personal comedy/tragedy Hofschneider faces. Spun out through the movie are strange dreams/nightmares that Hofschneider has - he and Hitler hiding in a closet together, Hitler also hiding his own circumcision, and Hitler dancing with Stalin; these are witty and shocking at the same time.

I first watched it as a young(ish) boy who was studying the second world war. It brought to life so many hideous things one has read about, but through the eyes of a character who could speak for the 'goodies' and the 'baddies'

Europa Europa is a great journey for one young man, and for all those that watch his adventures on te screen. Subtle peformances and some marvellous concepts really bring this one home.

Perhaps the special effects are not all that flash, but it's all to do with the charm of this film. Watching the film in both German and Russian gives it such a state of authenticity - with Marco Hopfscheider delivering a wonderful performance as young Jup.

Watching this film, you know the director achieved his goal, as you sympathise with members of the Nazi regime, and of course with the persecuted Jewish. Others in the story - the Polish, etc are also given a voice.

Some people find the ending; with the real Solly singing his song - somewhat tacky. I find that it adds to the realism of the film - and reminds you that this is not a make believe story, nor a Hollywood creation: but the real events of what many a person had to experience in the Third Reich.

Please watch it and make others do so too - perhaps next time when I say ""Europa Europa"" - the person I am speaking to may say ""Oh of course, I Love that film!""",1140652800,5,1553,4.283276450511946

From the strict demands of the new government, viewers see the severe insecurities felt by more and more Europeans, as they would constantly question if they fit such rigorous demands of character and physical traits that fascism encouraged.  To me, the movie's overall theme surrounded around the idea of a ""master race"" of Aryans and ""purebred"" Germans, and when a Jew, ""Jupp,"" merely through luck, escapes his fate of being exterminated, when he defies the system and becomes looked at as a pure German, all reasoning about the idea of a master race is destroyed.  Viewers of ""Europa Europa"" experience how fascism in 1930's Germany and its bizarre ideas are based on mere nonsense.

 The only problem I had with this movie was the strange sequencing of events.  ""Jupp"" has some confusing dreams in the duration of the film, which often stray from the true meaning and themes the film portrays.  The dreams may try to incorporate the true political aspects of German government, (for example, the Hitler-Stalin agreement is portrayed in the first dream) but they often infringe on the movie and deviate from the overall message the movie tries to send about the situation in Germany.",1139270400,3,1364,5.089686098654709

However, it is an original German film and they customarily find the explicit details more open than for myself. It seems to be one of those films that you would watch once, never forget it, and never want to view it again. The film was filled with satire on how Nazi ideology was just a bunch of egregious and blunder ideas. One scene that I found hysterical was a scene when Solomon, as known as Jupp with the Germans, was having his head measured in the ""best Nazi school for training boys"". The professor told the class that Solomon's features carried inevitably strong traits of a purebreed aryan. Overall, I personally found this movie with details that felt outstretched, but was covered with many good proofs how a lot of things were through WWII.

My favorite scene is in the classroom where the teacher does a lesson to show that you can identify a Jew by the shape of their skull and he fails to do so. I think this scene did a good job at depicting the flaws in Nazi ideology. I also liked the part where the children were told to pray to the Fuher for candy and it falls from a vent in the ceiling.

Pseudo-science was also interestingly portrayed throughout the film.  In one particular scene where the professor uses Solomon as an example of an authentic Aryan, it is proven how foolish and artificial German's are. Also, the ending is a bit vague, he leaves with his brother to lead a new life, but it is untold where he is heading.  Other than that, some of the scenes were extreeeemely unnesscesarry and took the focus away from the actual theme of the movie.  It is about world war 2, showing the boys gentitals was completely uncalled for.  In some area's it seems appropriate to indirectly refer to it, such as the time when he is in pain because of undoing his circumcision, but they most definetly did not have to show the audience.  Knowing what was occuring was quite enough.  As well as these scenes, the intercouse scene in the train also brought a sickening twist to the movie.  I personally still feel uneasy about it.

The story of Solomon is a story of great luck, and a boy's struggles trying to survive during the Third Reich.  Solomon is greeted by many people with different beliefs than him and he is very open to them.  There were some unnecessary parts, such as some of the train seen, and the extended barn scene.  Our history teacher wanted us to see what life was like for a teenage jew living in Germany, and I believe that this was illustrated tremendously in the movie.",1139270400,,594,4.566037735849057

His incredible luck throughout the story sounds greatly exaggerated but some areas are actually true. These include fooling the Nazi teachers into thinking he is an Aryan among other things. This movie further enforces the idea that Nazi ideology was mere a pseudo science based on nothing factual. Although this is mainly a factual movie about Solomon Perel, it seems there were many exaggerations in the movie. The ending was created to coincidentally with the reunion. It was as if it was made just for the sake of the movie's plot rather than real actual fact.

The main character of the movie is countlessly being given miracles it seems, as he escapes harm numerous times. The events and characters in the movie seem to be a bit overexaggerated and untrue at times. This may only seem this way however because of the unbeleivableness esss of the events. For example,one character in the German Armyy that Solomon is friends with turns out to be a homosexual, and tries to go as far as molest ""Solly"" or ""Jupp"" as he is affectionaley known by the germans. The movie also features many ""adult"" scenes, as well as gory and unnecesary scenes, going as far as depicting sex on a train and the main character's penis(numerous times i may add, with one very disgusting scene that many men will find painful) that seemed unnecesary.

Not only does Perel escape German rule AND Russian rule, but he manages to join the Hitler Youth, avoid getting caught, and convince hundreds of Nazis that he is a German when he clearly does not resemble them physically. I thought that was far-fetched, and the scenes were comical rather than disturbing, although many of them WERE disturbing. However, the movie is very interesting and I learned a lot about the idiocies of Nazi idealogy through Perel's struggle. Some scenes are unnecessary and explicit and do not contribute to the storyline, but it just added to the comical stylings of the movie.

If they wanted to make this movie better, the directors would cut out the inappropriate parts (on the train, in the barn, in the bathtub) because they didn't add anything of value and they were kind of disgusting. And  if it was a true story, i really don't see how soloman could still be alive after everything that happened to him. I just don't think its possible for one teenager to betray so many people and get away with it. There is a line that he crossed, he should of remembered his religion and his family and stopped being so selfish. So overall, this movie kind of sucked.

That shows was their ideology was made up and didn't make any sense. I also felt that the movie really showed what living in Germany was like, how they were raised, and how they felt about the Jewish people.

Also I is interesting how the Holocoust has come across as all about Hitler and what he did he was hardly even in the movie. Overall I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone. Some of the events might of stretched the truth a little or there might of been key points left out but from my point of veiw it made me realize how stupid the Nazi's were and couldn't even tell that a Jew was pretending to be a pure German.,1139270400,,735,4.183098591549296

And then you realize that because it was so bizarre, it stole 11 million lives; 6 million of them being Jews.

  Also, this video included views from the Germans and a Jewish teenager fighting for his survival. Learning about what the Germans tought young men made you feel very sorry for the Jews. And the fact that Soloman had to take part in it was very sad. He was forced to lie and support the killing of his own race just to survive.

  Although some scenes were unnecessary, the rest of the movie seemed well enough to get the point across. It was stretched a bit too far, but not exaggerating it would make the movie pretty boring.

However, the small details that come up excessively throughout the movie such as a scene where the two men are ""letting out waste"" towards the end add no meaning to the story and do not contribute to the plot. The movie also decides to ""show"" the audience various grotesque ""things"" when the description of the ""things"" could have sufficed. Overall, scenes throughout the movie correspond quite accurately to historical events such as the Night of Broken Glass.

This movie has got to be the worst foreign film ever and is all to blame on a little brown man my history teacher who believed this movie would broaden our views on Nazi ideology and Jewish mistreatment during the Third Reich. Unfortunetly, large portions of the film is untrue, exaggerated, made up, or retarted in order to cause the viewer to breathe a deep sigh at the end just for the pleasure that the movie is finally over. the little brown man owes the four-b class a big one for this, biased movie on jews.",1139184000,4,1149,4.665024630541872
151880,4,0792842626,"This movie, based on a true story,takes place during WWII, when a Jewish teenager, Soloman escapes death by feigning his identity. He leaves Germany and Poland and sails to Russia, joining a communist school. About two years later, he finds himself in the hands of the Nazi, and escapes by saying he is a pure German. He becomes a translator between the German and Russian troops. Oddly, he ends up joining a Nazi school to save himself.

THroughout this movie, Soloman can be viewed as a brave person and a coward. He conceals the fact that he is Jewish in a Nazi school. However, the fact that he is willing to change his identity rather than fight for his people shows that he is somewhat of a coward, and is willing to do anythnig for his survival. In Europa Europa, it is evident how crazy Nazi idealogy was. In one part of the movie, when Soloman was in the Nazi school, his teacher claims that you can easily identify a Jewish person through the thickness of their head and manner in which they walk. However, everyone fails to recognize that Soloman is Jewish himself.

It was an odd experience watching this movie in my history class, seeing as some scenes were awkward and weren't needed (like one scene in which Soloman is chased around a barn naked). It was somewhat funny that so many German women, and a man, found Soloman so attractive, not even knowing he was Jewish. We further learned about Nazi idealogy and psuedo-science. Throughout the movie, it was clear how lucky Soloman was, to be at the right place at the right time.

Minus a couple disturbing scenes, this drmatic movie was great. It displayed how Nazi idealogy was contradictory and based on psuedo-science. The acting was great, as well.",1139184000,,1718,4.644736842105263

By watching the movie, the audience is able to understand what life was like for a Jew trying to escape from presecution, what being in a Russian and German school during world war 2 was like, and what it felt like to be fighting for Nazi Germany. It showed how the war was not really against Russia or the Allies but against the Jews which they felt were an inferior race. The movie shows how a Jewish boy, whom according to Nazi ideology is inferior, survives and becaome German hero. The message behind the movie is that there is nothing to back up Nazi ideology and that there is no such thing as an inferior race because the Jews whom they thought of as inferior was successful in a German school.",1139184000,,822,4.309677419354839
151882,3,0792842626,"""Europa Europa"" was a historical movie, based on a true story, about a German Jew that escapes death with some unbelievable luck. As I was watching it with my history class, I was amazed at both the amount of luck he had and at the pseudo-scientific nazi ideology theories. It was ironic how a Jew ended up being a German war hero, and the irony showed even more so in the scene where the German teacher was teaching the students how to recognize a Jew. He was examining Solomon's physical traits, and announced to the class how although he did not have traits of a pure race, he was truly a perfect Aryan.

I was surprised that Hitler didn't play as big of a role as I thought he would in the movie. He barely had a part, and everyone just made references to him, whether it was condemning him or worshipping him. The movie mainly revolved around the conflict between the Russians and the Germans, and Solomon going back and forth between those two sides.

Although the movie overall created an interesting historical experience, some scenes were just unnecessary. I would find myself just turning away at all the bath tub scenes (and there was a lot of them), and also the train and the barn scenes. I didn't really see the point of showing all the nude parts. The idea could have just as easily been gotten without the visuals. The ending was also a bit abrupt, and didn't explain too much. However, the movie in its entirety was okay. Even though I personally would not see it a 2nd time, I would recommend it to anyone with a strong interest in World War II and the Nazi ideology.",1139184000,,1585,4.443298969072165

I'd consider it quite amazing for Solomon to accomplish this, albeit the help he recieved when he was forced to reveal the truth. I'd never be able to take the risks involved in such a journey, and give him respect for swallowing his pride and becoming his own worst enemy.

On the movie, I believe that the portrayal of his exploits are not that realistic, although I believe that this could have happened to him in real life. Solomon's character was done pretty well, although most of the other characters were not done as well. I warn that some of the things portrayed in the movie, while based on fact, are WAY too inappropriate and excessive, and an alternate way to show those parts should really have been considered by the director. If many scenes were edited for dramatic effect rather than truth, why not alter some of the scenes that I'm pointing out as well?",1139184000,,1054,4.6063829787234045

I thought it did a good job of portraying the mass slaughter of the jews.  Also it showed that not all Germans were murders, and some actually helped the jews.

Yes, the story's important but it just seemed as if this kid lived his life completely off of luck, and that's not realistic. I watched this movie in history class and I hope to never see it again. The movie would have been good if some of those parts were excluded. Instead of enjoying the movie, I would turn my head everytime a bath would come up (and there were plenty of those). Don't get me wrong, the story was good but some things were definately dramatized and made up. My class just kept saying ""wow he's lucky,"" ""that was lucky,"" ""woah, how did he get through that?""

151888,4,0792842626,"Europa Europa is a fun movie about a tragic time in history. The director, Agnieszka Holland, takes  great license in making this film.  Naturally, though based on a remarkable story, it is hyperbolized to great degree.  Don't let this prohibit you from watching this film.  Being essentially a war movie made by a female director it garners a wide audience through its use of humor, emotion and a little bit of surrealism.

Although the film plays like an anime movie in which the most bizarre and coincidental events happen, it only helps to portray the way the adolescent Solomon sees the world. This makes the movie all the more fun.  The mixed emotions and panics and ecstasies that Solomon, the protagonist, feels play in tune with the deception which he uses to survive. I, though far from adolescence, can still remember the drama in the most mundane actives. While I don't want to say that Solomon is a ""Drama Queen"", even he as a character seems to exaggerate his plight at times.

When I first saw this movie I was as old as Solomon is supposed to be and I think this could be why I enjoy it so much.  Overall the film is beautifully shot and while it is less than historical it is fun and interesting to watch.  I think in these days when the WWII an the holocaust do not receive enough attention in schools this film is a great medium for introducing to teens (and adults for that matter) the turmoil of central europe during the middle of the last century.  It is endearing and a humanizing portrayal of WWII Europe that can help to open up discussion of the tragedies of our past.

We only saw a short section of the movie but, being from Germany, I had to borrow this movie from my professor.  It was amazing to see this story of survival.  What makes it more imprssive is that it is based on a true story of a jewish boy serving in the German Wehrmacht and is porttrayed as the picture perfect Aryan soldier due to his heroics.  It was kind of ironic how no one found out that he was jewish except for his gay friend who served at the front with him.  The main point of that relationship was that German's come in different shapes and forms.  The type of German's they concentrated on were gay's and jew's, two of the most hated lifestyles in Germany at the time.  The movie shows you the horrors of war with an artistic twist to it.  EX: Hitler dancing with Stalin and Hitler hidding in the closet saying he is a jew, too.  I could go on and on but this is a must see if you are into foreign movies.

151920,5,0792842626,"Europa Europa is set in the year before and during the World War II in Europe.  The story is based on the true events of the young boy, Salomon ""Solly"" Perel (Marco Hofschneider), son of a shopkeeper in Poland who experienced brutality through the eye of the enemy as he had to disguise himself in order to survive as his heritage was Jewish.  Initially Solly escapes the German's wearing a Nazi leather coat with the Swastika on the arm, which becomes his first disguise or act in order to survive.  This continues throughout the film where Solly must hide his true identity, which deals with his circumcision, culture, and background.  The constant acting by Solly leads him to begin to feel unsure about his true identity as he tries to assimilate into Nazi-German culture and reject himself.  At one point Solly's feelings towards his Jewish background are close to hatred as he also struggles with the natural dilemmas of a teenager such as identity and love.  Europa Europa is a dark coming of age film depicting the terrible destiny of Solly as he grows up as a pro-Nazi in order to survive and have self-discovery while hiding himself from himself.  When the audience stretches their legs during the end credits there will be much room for pondering and contemplation as Europa Europa leaves the viewers with an excellent cinematic experience.",1089504000,6,1351,4.8478260869565215
151921,5,0792842626,"This is one of the best films in the genre--historial film from autobiography.  Marco Hofschneider brings to brilliant life the story of Salamon Perel, a German Jew.  From the days of Kristallnacht--the Night of Broken Glass, when Jewish businesses were trashed and vandalized throughout Germany, to his final reunification with his brother--to poignant to say more about this here...this is a cinematic masterpiece.
I've seen few films that capture the turmoil of adolescent identity and identification so well.  True, the Nazi era is the backdrop, but the themes couldn't be more universal.  In that respect, it is also more relevant today, in 2004, than during the 1980s, when it was filmed--especially in America, where the American identity has been deconstructed so as to be hardly palpable.  Also, it is equally relevant in Europe, where national distinctions could meld into a Confederacy if not a Union of some power.
Politics aside, this is an intensely personal film, one where the unquestioned identity of youth (German) falls victim to oncoming War and cruel happenstance.  Perel must continually revise his vision OF himself and FOR himself, and at one point wishes for nothing more than to be an Nazi, for a beautiful young German girl becomes enfatuated with him.  How did he end up in this position, wearing the uniform of the Hitler Youth at an Elite boarding school in Berlin?  Or lose his virginity to a high-ranking female Party member while he is escorted by train from the Eastern Front to Berlin, as a Folk Hero (Volksdeutscher Held).  Perhaps you think it unimaginable.  I do not.
I've seen places in German where the remnants of Jewish culture and tradition are clear as day--such as a former High School for Jews in Berlin--with Hebrew and German inscribed clearly in the stones.
No, though Germany seems to some a heartless pillar of unemotionality, efficiency, heartlessness, the German characters in Europa, Europa are as human as those found anywhere.  They fall victim to their personal aspirations, desire to please, deceitfulness, betrayal...simply put, human.
Although current fashion is to think of the period as one of the ""banality of evil"" (attributed to Hannah Arendt, Holocaust scholar), this film exposes the period as one more of human triumph and tragedy, and that, while we grow into adulthood, our personal identity is as much at the mercy of the passage of time and events as a unique, solitary construction.
See this film!  It will draw you into the themes of Life, Love, and Redemption, and be over leaving you desperate for more.",1077235200,91,2579,5.056603773584905

151923,4,0792842626,"I caught this movie originally on cable a few minutes into the film and was instantly intrigued and completely confused. A Jewish kid in the German Army? And the Hitler Youth? And in love with a German girl who says nice things like 'If there were a Jew here right now, I'd cut his throat!' right before she asks him to father her child. What the hell was going on here?
What was going on was 'Europa, Europa', an outstanding and often funny (true) story of a teen of German-Jewish extraction named Jupp who in 1939 was in the Communist Youth League in one of the Soviet-occupied Baltic territories, and ended up being captured by the Germans when they invaded the USSR in 1941. Naturally he concealed his Jewish identity and, believing him to be Volksdeutsch (a non-German of German blood, and therefore automatically a German citizen under Hitler's laws) the Wehrmacht drafted him as a soldier-translator. This begins Jupp's double life....a few months ago he was a Communist and a Jew, and now he's a German and a Nazi....just imagine this kid's confusion. The soldiers of his unit adopt him as a sort of mascot, and even when one of the soldiers discovers his secret, he does not betray him. The mutual affection between Jupp and the soldiers becomes real over time, and leads to Jupp's first crisis of identity: how can he be friends and comrades with men who believe Jews are evil, sub-human scum? Things get even more complicated when the violently anti-Semetic commander of the unit offers to adopt Jupp and send him back to Germany to join a Hitler Youth hostel. Out of the frying pan, into the fire.
Jupp finds the Hitler Youth both a dream and a nightmare. On the one hand, much of the Nazi propaganda turns out to be true -- the boys are tough, fun-loving, comradely, and loyal. They enjoy their singing, marching, and sports, and they are truly inspired by the destruction of snobbery and class privelege which was a central objective of National Socialism (Nazism). On the other hand, they sing charming songs like ""sharpen your knives on the paving stone, the Jewish blood will run"" and spend time in class learning to 'spot' Jews and other sub-humans through racial characteristics (Jupp is selected as a good example of Baltic Aryan blood). These kids remind you of darling young tiger cubs that will grow up into man-eaters: they are both charming and frightening.
Much of the movie is a black-comic attempt by Jupp to fit in as a loyal German youth while hiding his Jewish identity from his friends, which is tough on account of being circumcised in a society where circumcision was performed only among Jews (there are some lengths Jupp goes to to disguise this fact that will make any man watching EXTREMELY uncomfortable....I kept thinking ""God, that poor kid!""). As you can imagine, when he falls for a lovely Arayan maiden, disguising this fact becomes even harder.
As the war roars towards its conclusion, Jupp is torn by the loyalty and sense of belonging he feels in the HJ/Nazi Germany and his true identity. After the defeat at Stalingrad, the mourning boys gather and sing poignantly together as brothers, and Jupp mourns with them. The fact that he is clearly not faking shows the turmoil and conflict in his young heart. Is he Jupp, the Jew, or Jupp, the Nazi?
""Europa, Europa"" is different from 'Holocaust' type movies in that it injects a lot of humor into otherwise horrible situations without cheapening what happened. This is an undeniably tragic and moving film; it is also pretty damn funny. But it will also make you mad, and the really infuriating thing for the viewer is the colossal waste of it all -- the movie shows how the egalitarian ideals of National Socialism inspired, moved, and united young people, but was perverted by race hatred, anti-Semetism, and bloodlust, and ulyimately had to be destroyed at a terrible cost to everybody involved. What a stupid, criminal waste of millions of able young men, who were taught to hate people really no different than themselves. What a pity the Germans chose to forget the many Jews who served ably and courageously for their country in World War I, and bought into Hitler's insane hatred of them, a hatred which was not only stupid but hypocritical. After all, the man who in 1917 or so recommended a young Corporal Hitler for his Iron Cross First Class was a lieutnant named Hugo Gutmann....but somehow I'm willing to bet that fact never came up in any Hitler Youth class. Too bad for Jupp, and too bad for Europa.",1066176000,34,4509,4.737913486005089

The true story of a courageous young man's harrowing trip through the ever-shifting, uncertain days of WWII in Poland and Russia.  He has to be one of the luckiest or unluckiest figures of WWII, depending on your take on the measures he must go to in order to survive.

151927,5,0792842626,"In 1938, on the eve of his Bar Mitzvah, Solomon Perel's life is turned upside down when a Nazi rampage results in his sister's death and Solomon (Marco Hofschneider) and his family is forced to move to L&oacute;zd, Poland.  However, the inevitable German occupation forces Solomon and his brother Issac (Rene Hofschneider) to flee east and is seperated.  Solomon meets a kind Soviet officer and is taken to a Russian orphanage and becomes a Koccmatol- the Soviet equivalent to the Hitler Jugend with simular religious fixations for their leaders.  He spends three years there in Communist indocrination until the Hitler-Stalin pact is broken and Germany invades, leaving him to run before getting caught.  Solomon convinces the Nazis that he is a 'pure bred German' named Joseph Peters and they find his Russian languge skills usefull.
A gay soldier that nearly molests him while bathing finds out his secret (Non-Jewish Germans even today is seldom circumcised), but because he is a 'different kind of German', he  befriends him instead of exposing him.  After a brief battle that leaves him as the only survivor in his group, an attempt to defect to the Russians instead results in their capture and inadvertantly becomes a hero.  A German officer takes a liking to him and holds an interest in adopting him, then sends him to a elite Hitler Youth school, where he would have a more difficult time hiding who he is.  There, he is competitive, popular and deemed to be the 'jewel of authentic Aryan purity' by a series of head measurments and comparison samples.  He also falls in love with a beautiful and loyal Nazi girl, Leni (French actress Julie Delpy) whom he cannot be intimant with for obvious reasons and she instead uses his roomate so she can offer a child to the Reich.
After a few monthes of close calls and a painful attempt to restore his foreskin, Solomon/Jupp fights against the Russian Front, deserts his company and surrenders to the Russians only to be saved by the skin of his teeth when his brother reconizes him before being executed.
Interesting facts:
The ending is a cinematic misnomer of a true story from what I've read as Solomon was merely liberated by Americans who learns the truth with the help of his brother.
I saw a special about the holocaust with an interview with Solomon Perel, and he has blue eyes.  To be honest, I thought Marco and his brother, Rene had rather distinctive (and hansom) Semitic features and it does nicely in disproving Goethe's Aryan purity test in the classroom scene.
Rene Hofschneider was origionally chosen to play Solomon, but after a couple years of budget constrants, by the time the film was set to shoot, it was decided that he was too old (I assume that he was over 20, cause his younger brother was over 18 himself at the time) and the role was given to Marco and he was cast as Issac.
Now if your moral sensibilities are going to make you complain about the male nudity and the mature themes, which is common in Europian cinema, then maybe you should stick to the flat and mundane American films you feel so safe with.",1057881600,9,3091,4.728624535315985

151940,5,0792842626,"A simply breathtaking film about the best and worst that humanity has to offer. While the cast, production and direction cannot be faulted, it is the intelligent way in which the Nazis are depicted that gives Europa Europa its power.
Like Swing Kids, Lucie Aubrac and Schindler's List, Europa Europa avoids the ""white hats"" and ""black hats"" approach to the characterizations. Yep, a lot of the Hitler Youth were decent kids, however misguided, and yes, some of the German military were just honest soldiers doing a job. It is this humanizing of the German and Russian sides that really draws you into this remarkable young man's (true) story.
It is staggering to think that he could evade exposure for so long, given that the Germans, like the British, never circumcized male babies except for medical reasons. Apart from all of the chaos and imminent physical danger, this ""will he won't he be discovered"" adds an almost unbearable level of tension to what is already a gripping movie.
The nonsensical racial purity classes underscore the ideas put forward by Dr. Angela Davis that race and even gender are more of a social construct than a question of biological essence.

151942,4,0792842626,"This is a great movie that accomplishes much more than providing the viewer with a great story.  It is a great chronicle of WW2 seen from different sides, and it disposes of the myth of racial superiority.

This is the story of Solomon Perel, a German Jew boy who survives WW2 by switching sides as his home is overwhelmed by one side or the other.  First he is in Germany, and then sent to Poland.  On September 1st, 1939 Poland is invaded by Germany.  On September 17th, it's invaded by the CCCP.  Perel is trapped under the CCCP side, where, as a boy, he quickly becomes a member of the KOMSOMOL.  This is the communist version of Hitler Youth, and though most people don't realize this or never heard of the KOMSOMOL, the two rganizations are IDENTICAL, each having freaky god-leader fixations on Hitler or Stalin, and being made to indoctrinate young people.

He does well as a Komsomol and learns Russian.  Soon, however, in June, 1941, Germany invades Soviet-controlled Poland on its way to invade Russia.  Again Perel has to switch sides, sells himself as an orphaned German gentile, and at the tender age of 13 he hooks up with a German infantry unit as a translator.  He survives the torments of the Eastern Front and is adopted by a Wermacht officer who sends him back to the Fatherland to attend a Nazi Youth academy.

Here in the academy, the myth of racial superiority is debunked in a great scene when a nazi doctor in a nazi youth school measures the cranial and facial dimensions of the lead character, Solomon Perel, a German ethnic Jew.  The doctor declare's Perel's face and head match those of a perfect specimen of the aryan race, and if he had blonde hair and blue eyes he would be that perfect specimen.  Perel is also very competitive and often outdoes his aryan friends in both academics and physical competition.

This film effectively describes the insanity that swept over Europe in the 40s.  It's engaging and earnest, and if it wasn't for the deus ex machina at the end that didn't happen in real life, I would give it five stars.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good movie.  If only it were on DVD!

151943,5,0792842626,"One day in 1939, a Jewish boy's life is turned upside down. His home, his family, his very existence is shattered when the German armies pour into a wide-open Poland.  In EUROPA EUROPA, director Agniewska Holland shows what happens when a state of youthful male innocence collides with the reality of the Nazi whirlwind. The audience sees the war through the eyes of Solomon Perel, a multi-lingual sixteen year old Jewish boy living in Germany.  Marco Hofschneider, who plays Sollie, presents us with the Jewish everyman, one who wishes no more than to be left alone to live his life in peace.  Too young to fight, he is not too young to run.  And this is what he and his brother do. They both leave their home village to seek safety in Poland. They are separated, not to be reconciled until the end of the film, in 1945 in Berlin.  Sollie winds up in a Russian orphanage, where his linguistic abilities allow him to blend in with the other Russian orphans.  It is precisely here that Director Holland pokes a subtle thrust at one of the most controversial methods of Jewish survival during times of anti-semitic pogroms.  Historically, whenever Jews were faced with killing, their choices were limited to one of two: die without fighting back (as did most Jews who wound up in the death camps) or blend in as best they could while denying their essential Jewish identities.  Sollie, with his youthful good looks and fluency in Russian and German, chose the latter.  From the first moments of his flight from Germany, Sollie had to play the ethnic will-o-the-wisp.  What language he spoke, what uniform he wore, what leader he praised, all were a function of who was aiming a gun at his head. Sollie was better at playing the chameleon than most.  In fact, he played the German so well that he was chosen by his Nazi superiors to enroll in the Hitler Jugend, a group that taught him the real meaning of psychological self-debasement.  Throughout the war, Sollie had to change sides several times, each time etching in his soul the increasing need to find some spot of fixed dogma. In one superbly understated scene, Sollie, wearing the uniform of a junior SS cadet, stares morosely through a wind-chilled window and draws with his finger the Jewish star of David, almost as if to remind himself of who he in beneath the gleaming and shiny black leather uniform. By the end of the film, he has come full circle.  Sollie is captured by the Russians in Berlin, who promptly disbelieve his claims that he was forced to leave the sanctity of the Russian orphanage to join the Waffen-SS.  Surprisingly enough, he finds his long lost brother in the ruins of a smoking Berlin, and both survive the war to live in Israel.
  This film shows the result of how a defenseless people are forced to use assimilation as their only technique for survival.  In Solomon Perel, Agniewshka Holland shows both sides of this coin of survival.  To assimilate, one must play the ethnic and religious chameleon to perfection, but in doing so, one must never forget that this is only an act, and that etching one's symbol of life on a cloudy window may be the only way to do that.",1023494400,3,3153,4.6504504504504505
151944,4,0792842626,"Frankly, I'm quite tired of ""Oh how terribly persecuted the Jews were under Nazi Germany"" films.  However, I think that is because there was a flood of terribly mediocre films that were wildly popular because of the caustic nature of the subject matter.  A few of such films have been amazingly deep and leaps and bounds above the hollow sentimentality of the others:  Shindler's List, Aurevior Les Enfants, and Europa Europa are the three top that come to mind.
Shindler's List deals with a broader subject matter and the benevolent nature of a German businessman and gentile:  Shindler.  Au revoir Les Enfants and Europa Europa deal with a much more personal story from the Jewish perspective.  They are about the children caught in the prejudice and the hatred.  Au revoir is from the childhood angle (in this French film) where Europa Europa (a German, Russian, and Polish film) deals with the subject matter from an adolescent/teenager's standpoint.
Our lead character is a charming young Jewish boy, Solly (a boy new to acting - Marco Hofschneider), who upon Nazi occupation of Poland assumes the identity of a gentile to stay alive.  In doing so, Solly  - in some of the most physically painful moments of the film - attempts to disguise his circumcized penis be pulling skin forward on it and tying in place with string.  This is necessary as Solly joins up with Russian soldiers, joins the Nazi youth as an exemplary example of the Aryan race, and then again hooks up with the Russians.  Passing as a Nazi, Solly is privy to all the hatred and anger the Nazis had toward the Jews.  He must also assume that stance to exist.
I don't want to give away the film to tell more, except that according to my father who fought in WWII, such action actually did occur more often than one might think.  This is the true story of Solomon Perel who, at last telling, was still alive in Israel.
Get the film in German, Russian, and Polish with subtitles.  It would be far more truthful than any dubbed version.

Its supposed to be true story. If you look at incredible stories of World War II, (like German soldiers taking speed to keep them awake during Blitzkrieg) I would definetely believe it. Anyway the movie is about a young jewish boy, who flees Poland when the Germans invade. He is made to join a Communist led orphanage where he is indoctrinated with Communist ideas. Then, he is again abandoned, and falls into German hands. His impeccable German allows him to join their army as a russian translator. They believe his story that he is an Aryan. He is then sent to a Hitler Youth school where he struggles to prevent others from seeing the obvious sign that he is a jew.

However, as is often the case, the film resorts to some ""over the top"" plot changes at the end which were neither true to the book nor necessary to make it a great story. Solly in reality survives through a combination of luck, wits,  and acting ability. In the movie, Solly deserts his Nazi unit and surrenders to the Russians, who do not believe that he is Jewish and invite a Jewish camp inmate to shoot him.  As he stands with the revolver in his face he is recognized by his older brother and is thus saved by the skin of his teeth.  In reality Solly is liberated from the Nazis in an undramatic fashion by the Americans and is saved from being killed simply because the Americans didn't shoot Hitler Youth. He meets up with his brother later, after he is quite safe. This final coincidence in the movie is simply too much and spoils what is otherwise a fine production.

And sometimes surviving completely because of luck and being in the right place at the right time. The main character here, a young German Jewish man, is forced to flee his home with his family from Germany to Poland. Then his parents force his brother and him to flee on their own. The boy is the only one to escape. Strangely he works with the German Army at one point because they find him and a group of Jewish people and are going to kill them. He manages to convince them he is German, and through a strange set of events, they believe him and take him under their wing and decide that he will be useful to them. Although his secret is discovered by one of the German officers (who is trying to molest him), he is not given up. Later when the Germans are fighting the Russians, the boy ends up in Russians' hands, and luckily, he speaks perfect Russian, so they accept him. He is sent to a Russian school and stays there for some time. Somehow he ends up back in the Germans' hands, which is all the more dangerous. A German officer takes a liking to him and sends him back to his home to attend a German (Nazi) school. He fits in relatively well, but he must endure the classes in which Jews are compared to rats. He is a highly competitive student and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Leni (played by Julie Delpy). In their relationship Leni is physically aggressive and wants to consummate their relationship in order to produce a child for Hitler's revolution. The boy cannot comply or he will be exposed. She angrily dumps him and takes up with his best friend, but the boy does visit Leni's mother who has by this time guessed his secret and also is a sympathetic ear. Eventually the war ends, and the boy is still working with the Germans and now he is going to be arrested with the other Germans (by Allied soldiers), but just when he is going to be taken away, a long line of Holocaust survivors wanders by and the boy spots his older brother, and he is proven to be Jewish.
