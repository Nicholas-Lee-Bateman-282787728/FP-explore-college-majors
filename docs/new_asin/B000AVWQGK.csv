8079974,5,B000AVWQGK,"The original Korean version is a true gem. It is absolutely fantastic.

The MTV version, however, is utterly ridiculous. They changed the script and rearranged the scenes and came out just looking goofy.",1368230400,2,203,5.151515151515151

8079976,3,B000AVWQGK,"""Volcano High,"" is a Korean film I have heard of for some time. My nephew bought this DVD for me as a gift, as he is a big fan of this particular film. I thought the film was average, and do not wish to be too harsh on the film. Moreover, the film has a very comic book feel to it. Therefore, I can understand how it might appeal to some viewers. The film itself is a mixture of not only the ""Matrix,"" but I also noticed a little bit of ""Dark City"" in the film. [Especially during the end fight scenes]. I liked how the film opens up with the student Kyeong-su Kim (Jang Hyuk) having a ball of energy tossed his way by the teacher for not paying attention in class. Also, I do give credit to director Tae-gyun Kim for directing something interesting and different, and although I am not a big fan of the film, there were certain parts I thought were entertaining.

In the narrative, a student Kyeong-su Kim has been expelled from several schools, and therefore finds himself sent to Volcano High. This is a school for students with supernatural powers. Also, the film itself takes place in the future, and at Volcano High, students have divided themselves into two opposing camps. As the new student, however, Kyeong-su Kim refuses to join either one. He has been kicked out of too many schools, and decides not to fight. There is one particular bully named Jang Ryang (Su-ro- Kim) who picks on this new student, without realizing that Kyeong-su Kim actually has some pretty incredible powers. Jang Ryang, along with the latest principal are in league with each other to get a hold of a special manuscript which contain some sort of spells which will give one overwhelming supernatural powers. Or something to that effect.

I found myself being irritated with the character Jang Ryang, as he is supposed to be gifted with special powers, yet, quite a lot of the interaction with him and others in the film seemed to take on a comical twist--and not in a funny way, but more of silliness. When the new principal attempts to locate this manuscript, however, he cannot find it. Therefore, the principal sends away for 5 special teachers who have gifted powers, which are prominently displayed in the film. As these new teachers put everyone in their place at Volcano High, including Jang Rang, only the new student Kyung-su Kim, has the ability to stop them. There are some good action scenes with him and one powerful leather clad teacher toward the end of the film, which reminded my a lot of ""Dark City."" The film is filled to the brim with special effects. And in fact, it is the special effects that carry the film. The narrative is disjointed, but this is one of those kind of films that are just for entertainment. Nothing new here, but the kids might enjoy this one. The film is long and clocks in at 122 minutes. Recommended with caution: Rent it first.",1192492800,6,2859,4.549514563106796
