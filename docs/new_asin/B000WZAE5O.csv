The MUSIC is beautiful,haunting and memorable, working very well with the continuity of the film, like classic Disney animated features, and all of the Rogers and Hammerstien films did. Just the right amount of dark creepiness to satisfy the most critical horror film fan, filled with great rock and roll to satisfy the rock fan's pallete, and a story true enough to the Stevenson classic, yet original enough to not allow the viewer to second-guess the plot. an excellent film, destined to be a true rock and roll/horror cult classic film.",1129334400,4,757,5.213114754098361
2993120,5,B000WZAE5O,"This was a tremendously fun ride. It is a special moment when I actually fall into the story line and feel total immersion into the actors portrayal of an alternate world created by the skillful hands of gifted screenwriters and directors. To me, that is what entertainment is really about, the captured experience during the circus ride of sights and sounds a movie provides. I don't know why I didn't discover this flick sooner, I certainly try to keep an eye out for modern interpretations of the classics. This was a fine job interpreting the classic Hyde monster. I felt it was much more believable than the digitized mountainous Hyde's in the Van-Helsing and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen stories. You certainly owe it to yourself to try this more believable version out. The combination of an engaging soundtrack, believable actors, and a gripping version of the storyline kept me immersed throughout. I offer a ""job well done"" to this crew!!!",1129248000,,954,4.96875
2993121,4,B000WZAE5O,"True art constantly reinvents itself. And reinventing an art form is exactly what this film does. When we think of musicals, warm and approachable names like ""Oklahoma,"" ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"" and ""South Pacific"" come to mind. Films you grew up with. Films that leave a smile on your face. Admittedly, traditional musicals have almost always been associated with light hearted and sappy entertainment. Then there is that little handful of films that comes along and pushes the art-form, ""Tommy,"" ""Sweeney Todd,"" ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and films of that ilk. Art shouldn't be stagnate, it should reinvent itself. It should always be challenged.

The mere thought of taking the Robert Louis Stevenson's famed dark novel and turning it into a musical, is not only challenging an art-form, it is death defyingly risky. Fortunately, ""The Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde Rock 'n' Roll Musical"" succeeds with flying colors. To make it too serious would be to try to perfect an already perfect style of story-telling, and that's just plain boring. And, to make it sketch comedy silly wouldn't be challenging at all. Mel Brooks perfected the art form of making horror hilarious years ago (see ""Young Frankenstein"" for an iconic example of that). But, to let visceral rock and roll music and a raw, almost retro, style of filmmaking tell the story is just plain brilliant. I'm not saying that this film is an equal to ""The Godfather"" but it is definitely one cool ride. This is one of those fantastic films where if you sit back, let your hair down, expect nothing and let the music and the form carry you on a journey you'll walk away satisfied and deep in thought for weeks to come.

Bernhoft and Champagne (the songwriter/lead actor and director respectively) are an amazing filmmaking team who's raw talent to move you with their story is self-evident and effective. For me they have succeeded simply because I can't stop thinking about this film. I will not be surprised at all if it becomes a cult classic. It's style is unique, it's form is avant garde and it boasts a CD's worth of unforgettable music. No one has ever come close to telling Stevenson's timely tale, or for that matter any horror classic, like this.

All in all, I liked this film very much. It bothered me (in a good way) and made me content all in the same instant. Interesting films always do. This film is definitely worth having in your DVD library.",1129248000,,2429,4.7785714285714285

I don't tknow what to think, and a film that can make me not know what to think is rather unique. Usually i have an opinion already drawn, and Jekyll and Hide was no exception. Except, asI watched this film on DVD I almost immediately  began to think ""This film is what movies used to be."" Well not exactly, but my point is that Jekyll and Hyde felt like a cult film classic.  I congratulate the filmmakers for their take on an alreadynteresting story.

8226178,1,B000WZAE5O,"One of the worst and most pointless movies I have ever seen. Just - wow. My mouth is open and the flies are wandering in and out. Someone said, you should see this flim, it's so bad that it's kind of funny. No, no it's not. It's just bad, full stop. Terrible writing, super low budget, the whole concept is pretty much pointless, the lead actor is a hack, the directing that sucked the life out of all the acting, the idiotic sets, one pointless scene after another, the complete lack of plot or story . . . everything. It's kind of like a talentless 3rd grader got some friends together to make a movie that was written by her brother in Kindergarten. Trying to be a kind of Rocky Horror Picture Show maybe - but sorry, not even close. The music is not completely awful, but the lyrics and settings are so pointless that it hardly matters. The actress lead is kind of hot and I just feel sorry for her and wonder if she had any idea the movie was going to be so horrendous when she agreed to act in it. The VHS transfer is also abysmal, double letterboxed on a modern HDTV, and extremely low resolution, not that this film in high def would be any less painful. Once again we run up against the inability in an Amazon review to actually give zero stars, which I keep trying to click on, but it just won't bloody go through.",1449446400,,1324,4.237154150197629

Is it entertaining?  An argument can be made that it is, but I would think you would be arguing with someone on the ""high"" side of lucid.  The music is not all bad in that some of it is catchy.  But I am being kind.

If you are looking  for a well done professional show and want to see a bad example of that, then you have my recommendation.

8226187,5,B000WZAE5O,I was truly inspired by this musical. The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Rock and Roll Musical is a independent film that has a great story and wonderful music. It's not to often you see a rock and roll musical with such great musical talent.  I think any Rock /Horror enthusiast or independent film maker would enjoy seeing this film. The songs are great. I was wondering if there is CD with all the awesome music? Does anybody have it. It is great stuff. Gotta get the songs on my ipod! I hope this film is seen by a large audience. It's just great fun! Can't wait to see Bernhoft again. I hope he has something coming out soon! Maybe another horror musical?,1198800000,2,653,4.308943089430894
