8529531,3,B008POPRTC,"I watched this movie three times on my roku. I enjoyed it, it was more suspenseful which kept my mom and I at the edge of our seats more than anything really happening. Okay, a kid in a dark room who you only see his legs is given a jack in the box by this woman who is on the ground. She says that one day he will have a real birthday party with friends she tells him happy birthday then shuts the door. Fast forward twelve years later  six people are in a dark room the lights come on and there is this cute but dirty and silent man everyone is wondering what is going on. Then they start playing musical chairs after sometime and then after the first dude gets killed they start to catch on. I thought it was okay/good, but, I wanted to know more about how did the kid get like this and why did they lock him up was there something wrong with him? I would have liked to see more putting the whole thing together on how they were connected and why was it because they missed a party? The acting was okay. The creature/crazy person who brought them there was great looking for the ten seconds you saw him. It needed more of a story line connecting it all together and more seeing the monster if it would have had that it would have gotten five stars from me easily.",1426550400,,1266,4.104838709677419
8529532,1,B008POPRTC,"This movie had potential, but was a major let down.  The writers could have done a lot with this but chose not to.  Not worth buying maybe rent it so you can return it.",1415145600,,168,3.911764705882353
8529533,3,B008POPRTC,"This is a simple low budget ""10 Little Indian"" type film...actually 7 Indians. A group of people go to a basement where they are locked in and play musical chairs to the tune of ""Pop Goes The Weasel."" And the loser ""goes away."" I believe you get a quick glimpse of the person on the cover. The person conducting the game is introduced in the beginning with no further explanation. The film has a ""twist"" or the mystery of Nathaniel, which you should be able to pick up once the first clue is dropped.

This isn't the best film in the genre. Special effects consist of turning out the lights. The acting was decent. The dialogue was passing, but not exceptional. A movie you can watch once and enjoy, but wouldn't watch again...i.e. rental.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. I don't recall an F-bombs.",1410480000,3,801,4.517241379310345
