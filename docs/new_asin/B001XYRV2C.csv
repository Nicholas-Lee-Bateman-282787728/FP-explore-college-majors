8537121,5,B001XYRV2C,"The funniest Jewish movie ever made.

The story captures every possible Jewish character and scenario of Jewish family dynamics!

Despite taking place in Mexico , it could have taken place in Long Island, New Jersey, or Jerusalem.",1366761600,,230,5.1891891891891895
8537122,5,B001XYRV2C,"That's right. This movie is set during the shiva (mourning period) in an upperclass Jewish family in Mexico City. Almost all of it happens in one apartment in a high rise, everybody stuck together till they have to work it out. Imagine Mariachi and Klezmer in the same movie. Kosher tacos. Such a great new way to look at Mexico. What's not to like?",1334102400,3,349,4.46875
