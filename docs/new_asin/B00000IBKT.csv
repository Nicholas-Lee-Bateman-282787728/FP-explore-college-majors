1219271,5,B00000IBKT,"This very brutal and violent but also very good film surprised me greatly - and I am really glad that I bought and watched it. Below, some more impressions, with limited SPOILERS.

This being a Larry Clark film I was very apprehensive when beginning watching it, as I still remembered his other film, ""Ken Park"", which I absolutely, viscerally HATED (just to be precise, I still didn""t see ""Kids"" and ""Bully""). But from the first moments it is clear that this film very different from the rest of Clark's works.

This is a story about a ""crew"" of drug addicted bandits who travel a lot looking for high profit ""jobs"" around the country.

The leader of the group is Mel (James Woods), a very charismatic but also extremely dangerous and to say things straight, pretty evil guy. James Woods offered in this film a performance on the highest level of quality - honestly, with his way of playing him, he managed to make Mel a really scary, albeit not entirely anthipatic thug!

Mel's partner in crime is Sid, a very attractive woman in her late 30s, played also magistrally by Melanie Griffith. Sid is in all aspects an equal partner for Mel, as she handles the shotgun as well as her heroin - and you would not believe some of the places she injects herself in...

Bobbie and Rosie, played respectively by Vincent Kartheiser and Natasha Gregson Wagner (actors I didn't know before watching this film), are two homeless teenagers, who lived from little thefts before meeting Mel and Sid and ""graduating into serious larceny"".

Together those four unlikely partners will meet some more peculiar characters, amongst which the neo-nazi gang called ""Hitler's Henchmen"" is not even the most dangerous. This position belongs to the Reverend (James Otis), a creepy guy called by Mel with visible respect ""somebody you really do not want to f... with..."".

A special mention goes to Lou Diamond Phillips who plays Jewels, leader of a Latino ""crew"" of ferocious outlaws composed exclusively of gay men.

Surprisingly, this film contains some (very dark) humor, although many people will probably find some of the jokes and gags offending or at least of very poor taste. Some lines in this film are also pretty unforgettable.

This is a very violent and brutal film, with also some pretty explicit sexual scenes - this being a Larry Clark's film, there is a lot of scenes with almost naked teenage boys... The language is extremely strong, with one F-bomb every 30-seconds - but in this film, it actually makes sense, as all protagonists are drug abusing low lifes. Still, this film is strictly for grown-ups!

I believe this film shows with some realism the life of crime at the margins of the society, although of course some characters and scenes were somehow ""upgraded"" to make it more interesting. The scenario is pretty solid and characters act rather logically. And the ending also makes sense and is pretty good.

So bottom line, I give this tough and brutal film five stars without hesitation. I will also keep the DVD for possible reviewing one day. Enjoy - if you dare!",1367884800,,3066,4.798861480075901

Vincent Kartheiser debuted in his first film as an adult (although playing a 16 year old), showing that he truely has talent and can dig deep for such a complex character in this part.

James Woods was part of the production team of the film and while this is not a movie that I expect did well at the box office, it certainly is another one of Wood's demonstrations of excellent character acting.

1219308,4,B00000IBKT,"Like any of Larry Clark's previous films ""Another Day in Paradise"" is full of explicit sex, drugs, violence, and language. This film also has four of the best and most overlooked performances in years. The acting is so brilliant and real that you find yourself caring about characters who are junkies, killers, and thieves. Not an easy feat but thanks to the actors, by the end of the film you hope that things end well for them. Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser) and his girl Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner) are a couple of junkies in love. To support their habit Bobbie robs vending machines. At the conclusion of his last heist he was caught by a security guard and beaten to within an inch of his life requiring medical attention. A charismatic and mysterious man named Uncle Mel (James Woods) becomes Bobbie's doctor icing him down and shooting him full of heroin. Once Bobbie heals Mel  offers him  a job. Mel has been casing a pharmacist and plans on relieving him of a couple of thousand pills, he just needs one more man to go in on it with him. When Bobbie hears how much his end would be he packs Rosie up and the two hop into Mel's Cadillac and set off on a wild road trip. Accompanying them is Sid (Melanie Griffith) Mel's girl and another junkie. The new team pull off their first heist successfully and set to work selling the merchandise. Things are going well for Bobbie and Rosie, both of whom came from abusive homes, who think they have finally found real parents who love them and will look after them. When a buy goes south Mel and Bobbie are left shot and bleeding  in need of a hideout. Since the other drugs can't be sold Mel's greed kicks in and he hastily assembles the robbery of a vault. Bobbie and Rosie are scared straight by their near death experience and want to go home but Mel won't let them. It is up to Bobbie to get them out since Rosie, who feared needles, is now shooting up regularly thanks to lessons from Mel. James Woods and Vincent Kartheiser are absolutely brilliant. Woods deserved to be Oscar nominated for this role it is so funny, scary, brilliant. Griffith and Wagner are also quite strong as the frightened and vulnerable women who can't say no to their dangerous men. The DVD has a great commentary from Clark who reveals that he had many confrontations with Woods that got pretty heated. He also admits his debt to Woods who put up his own money when the budget ran out. He credits him for not only saving the film but improving it since many of the best scenes were improvised by Woods on the spot. The ending,  set to Bob Dylan's ""Every Grain of Sand"", is absolute poetry and the only way for this film to end. ""Another Day in Paradise"" is not only one of my favorite films but my personal favorite of both Woods and Clark. If you like either one of them don't miss it.",1235779200,2,2819,4.436293436293436
1219309,3,B00000IBKT,"Don't watch this movie if you are prone to bouts of depression - it may well push you over the edge.  Not badly acted for this genre of film, but just too much of a downer.  NOT for the kiddies!",1205280000,,194,3.825
1219310,5,B00000IBKT,"I discovered this wonderful movie a few years after it was made.
The music took me back to my youth when I would travel the 30 miles from Texas to louisiana, where the drinking age toget into clubs was 18. Even
though I was only 15 at the time I would try to dress older to get in and listen to the bands.  Somehow this movie and Larry Clarks explanations
helped me to understand my own crazy youth.  I fell in love with all the characters and cried when Bobby found Rosie dead.  Who could ever forget Mel and Bobby's scene in the Country with the fingers in the forehead?
Sid became such an endearing character with her love for Bobby and Rosie.  I definetly prefer the European Version of the movie.  I thought all the four principal actors were absolutely wonderful.  Even though this movie is a socalled Independent film, in my mind it ranks right up there with my favorites of all time.  Vincent Kartheisr  is the best
trained young actor I have seen since James Dean.  His eye and facial movements are the best.  I have begun to follow all four actors to see what is next.

It's a violent movie and not for the squeamish. But for people who can handle the grittiness it is a gripping and mind grabbing story. The acting by all four is superb. Of course James Woods is excellent when he plays an intense bad guy. Melanie Griffith is believable as Woods gun moll with a heart.",1155427200,2,596,4.36936936936937
1219313,4,B00000IBKT,"Director Larry Clark has a knack for penetrating the lost hopes and dreams of the young adult.  He also has a knack for discovering talented young artists for his films.  In the case of 'Another Day In Paradise', he also offers up James Woods (who always plays sleazy to a T) and Melanie Griffith (who gives her best performance on film in this movie).

Young lovers, Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser) and Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagnor) live in a flea-hole, using drugs and getting by on Bobbie's petty theft.  Bobbie runs into serious trouble while pilfering coins from snack machines, and ""Uncle Mel"" is called in to treat his injuries.  Mel (James Woods) takes a shine to Bobbie, and brings him up a notch in the world, from petty theft to big-time burglary.  Bobbie and Rosie take off with Mel and his long-time girlfriend Sid (Melanie Griffith), riding in a nice car, shopping for new clothes, and eating good meals in restaurants.

Mel masterminds a burglary on a medical office, and the foursome are now in business.  While business is good for a while, all good things must come to an end.  When one of the drug deals goes wrong, the foursome flees to the residence of The Reverend (James Otis).  (Look for Clark's usual suspect Leo Fitzpatrick in a bit role as The Reverend's gate guard)

The relationship between Mel & Sid, and Bobbie & Rosie begins to fall apart, though Mel & Sid have been like parents to the younger couple.  Mel wants one more big hit, but he is becoming more and more unstable.  Rosie's drug use has deteriorated from snorting to spiking.  At this point, as the foursome begins to turn on each other, you are left to wonder just who will be left standing in the end.

I was surprised, but pleased, at the violence in this film; I wasn't expecting it.  For some reason, I thought the film would be milder, with less action.  You will be surprised by the quality of the script and the amazing acting from the four main characters.  Look for a small role from Lou Diamond Phillips as Jewels, an overtly gay and violent character.  This is most likely Phillips best performance.

My only real complaint with the movie was the lack of subtitles (English or other languages) on the Director's.  Other than that, look forward to a faster pace than 'Spun' and more violence than 'Salton Sea'.  Enjoy!",1152230400,3,2318,4.629901960784314
1219314,5,B00000IBKT,"Larry Clark is probably best known for the film ""Kids"". Clark has only directed four films. ""Kids"", this film, ""Bully"", and ""Ken Park"" the latter was banned in America. This is probably his least known film, odd because it has the most recognizable actors of any of his previous movies. Also, I've seen

""Kids"" & ""Bully"" and this is easily my favorite of those. ""Kids"" had a really good message; ""Bully"" was entertaining and informative. This movie is really a mixture of ""Kids"" and ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and happens to be extremely entertaining. The movie is about two lovers named Bobbie & Rosie (Vincent Kartheiser & Natasha Gregson Wagner) who are each about 15 or 16 years old. They live in a run down apartment with a few other people and manage to survive because Bobbie robs vending machines. But then, a couple of crooks named Mel & Sid (James Woods & Melanie Griffith) take them under their wing and take them to the big time. Well, their version of the big time. Which means stealing speed from a doctor and then selling it. Meanwhile, Rosie is pregnant and still smoking/drinking/using. This movie, like kids, is really a raw no-holds-barred look at the life of these people. Clark has never been a director who's worried about what's socially acceptable. Which is why his films have such an impact and are all so good.

This movie held my attention completely and was never dull. It's also a movie you can watch more times after, which I don't really feel ""Kids"" was. James Woods (who also co-produced the movie) is absolutely spectacular. I think his performance (for which he recieved almost no attention or awards for) was better than the Oscar winner for 1998 Roberto Benigni was. Woods litereally keeps you watching. Griffith was good, but not standout. Kartheiser & Wagner were believable in their roles as the two young lovers Bobbie & Rosie, but these kind of performances aren't just about being believable but also about being able to get sympathy from the viewer which both of them do. All of the characters are well written, the dialouge is great. ""The Flinstones"" joke (and delivery) was hilarious. This movie is truly an experience and really an important movie that you shouldn't pass up.

GRADE: A-",1144108800,2,2222,4.78125
1219315,3,B00000IBKT,"This ironically-titled movie is almost too intense to bear.  The story about drug-addict criminals is realistic, but all the characters are foul-mouthed and repugnant.  If a film could be rated X for profanity alone, this would receive the ""honor,"" since almost every sentence in the dialogue is laced with profanity of the worst sort.",1138060800,,335,5.185185185185185
1219326,5,B00000IBKT,"Those who marvel at Olympic giant slalom skiing, or a virtuoso violinist or piamist playing at the edge of the instrument, or a race car driver leading the pack at the Indianapolis 500 ... or the Le Mans will be fascinated at what James Woods and Melanie Griffith put on screen in ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE. Having seen most of James Woods' films, and SALVADOR several times, I was on the edge of my seat watching Woods do what he does best: play a homocidal crook on the edge of an emotional explosion at each turn. Melanie Griffith is no slouch either in this movie where she is the gun Moll and lover of the man who she can barely live with and love. Then there are the two loser kids, superbly played by Vincent Kartheise and Natasha Gregson Wagner. ""Adopting"" the drugged out and oversexed young lovers, Griffith and Woods act as mentors in crime and surrogate parents as the ""family"" leaves a trail of blood in their violent trade.

Definitely, this is not a movie for children or even adolescents. The graphic drug, sex and violent scenes are all necessary for realistically carrying the film through to its logical conclusion. The film is about a group of dysfunctional people whose life of crime is pursued in an almost tenderly family setting. The young people desperately need parenting, while the characters played by Griffith and Woods hover and brood over their ""children"" trying to teach them how to live in the river of crime that this ""family"" wades through.

One of my favorite Woods scenes comes near the end in the car at a rural filling station. As everything in his life begins to unravel, Woods launches into such extreme paroxisms of rage and frustration that we the audience can feel, in his fit he's about to jump out of the screen and tear up our living room. That was a spectacular scene rivaling many of his legendary ones in SALVADOR.

Some people may not be able to stand the vehicle filmmaker Larry Clark uses for dragging us through the grotesquely twisted criminalized lives of two young druggies and their murderous elders. The repeated use of extreme expletives by the characters is necessary because these are people who are verbally inarticulate, and ""need"" to express themselves with an intensity that moves them to use weapons for self expression. I think viewed this way, the film makes sense. Otherwise, it will burn your ears off, offend your eyes and you'll not wish to see and hear any of it.

Melanie Griffith was very good but James Woods is absolutely great. Acting in a film of this genre cannot garner Academy Awards for those who made this movie. Nevertheless, ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE must be seen by fans of these gifted American actors.",1138060800,3,2687,4.686440677966102

The teenaged male (not too far from a junkie himself) is desperately searching for a father figure, who he finds in Woods, but Woods is reluctant to admit it, and crushes his protg every time things get a little too emotional.  Of course, crime doesn't pay, and the relationship comes to a bloody climax, making for a fascinating drama both for the crime details and for the way these four unlikely friends deal with one another.

1219330,5,B00000IBKT,"Good evening.  Or is that buenos noches?  I spent the

last 120 minutes watching the 1998 flick ""Another Day

in Paradise"".  This one came highly recommended as a

Bonnie & Clyde type crime drama.  Let me tell you the

truth.

This one captures James Woods at his best.  When I

heard several years ago that James was abusive in ""real life"", I felt there could be a thread

to his motion picture roles.  Guess what?  There is.

While I thoroughly enjoy crime dramas, ""Another Day In

Paradise"" is not for everyone.  Here's why.

It's loaded with crude profanity, an abundance of

blood, extreme violence, heavy smoking and drinking,

streamlined drugs, death, murder, emotional and

physical abuse to the point of insanity, raunchy sex,

lots of bullets flying, and gross dialogue and camera

pans that definitely make this a...a...a (let's say)

unique film.

Woods gets a 10.  His girlfriend (Melanie Griffith)

gets a 9.5.  Their sidekicks Vincent Kartheiser and

Natasha Gregson Wagner get 8's.  It is billed as a

Bonnie and Clyde for the '90s.  It plays out as a

deranged journey into merciless crime...moral

decadence and a heartless joy ride.  That's why I give

it a ""10""!!!

A 10, you say?  Yes!  Simply because if you like this

type of film, it is a solid 10.  If you don't, I

strongly recommend you not view it, nor give yourself

an opportunity to rate it.  It is not as extreme as

""Natural Born Killers"" by any means, but Woods'

satanic role is one worth watching.  The only other

person that could have played his role would have been

Jack Nicholson (that says a lot).

Trust me...this one is either a 10 or a 0...nothing

inbetween.

The DVD version contains both the Theatrical and

Director's Cut.  I watched the theatrical (which this

review is based upon).  I'm assuming the other side is

even more...??? (think about it).",1091923200,24,1852,4.701587301587302

Much is made about James Woods in this film ( and rightfully so ) but Vincent Kartheiser ( from the Angel series ) is the one who I was most impressed with.  He's a good actor I know, but he pulled off this role frightfully well. It's a Larry Clark film so you know you're going to see quite a bit ( literally ) of the two younger actors ( Kartheiser & Natasha Gregson Wagner ), but this doesn't take away anything from the film ( as in some of Clark's other works ).

He makes a deal to teach him the ropes, and soon the two teens are trailing Mel and his main squeeze Sid, a junky blonde (Melanie Griffith).
This is a Larry Clark film, which might immediately put some people off.  I like Clark's work, and his films are almost impossible to stop watching (the best example being the highly disturbing Bully).  There is a lot of sex, a lot of nudity (most of it between the two young criminals) and some stark violence.
But the story of this movie is James Woods.  The guy is flying off the screen, chewing apart nearly every frame; he's out of control.  Think of his masterful portrait of sleaze, Lester Diamond in Casino, and turn that up to 11.  Whether he's jabbing his finger at someone's head to make a point, or grabbing them by the collar to stress 'It's about MONEY!', or quick-drawing a pistol, he's totally in command of his craft.  We've seen him do stuff like this before, but this is special.  The highlight is one, long, extended take of him throwing a conniption in the backseat of a car, spittle flying, fists whaling, total acting.
The kids are young and naive and from broken homes.  Since Mel and Sid are unable to have kids, they `adopt' the two youngsters and act as surrogate parents.  Mel is one of the greatest depictions of a human cockroach I've ever seen.  He's about survival, pure survival.  The characters seem to wander in and out of blood-drenched situations with no cops in sight.  They fire guns, deal drugs, shoot drugs, and kill people and don't seem to be in any hurry to leave the scene.  It's a great portrait of a small time criminal life and its many pitfalls.  Eventually, the life becomes too much for the youngster, but there's every indication Mel will stay in the game, no matter the cost.

The DVD is good, looks and sounds great, and includes a commentary by Clark himself. Unfortunately, parts of the commentary are cut out, I don't recall why, but you can tell while listening.  There are long stretches of silence; I'm not sure if it was copyright issues or what, but it's not complete.  Overall, though, this is a lower-priced DVD and worth it for Clark fans, and especially for James Woods fans.
Recommended, at the very least, for the amazing performance of James Woods.",1082592000,4,2669,4.590717299578059

It is far from the beaten track in a sort of ""Drugstore Cowboy"" sort of way, but at the same time is pretty original and James Woods does a really good performance here on all sides.

Woods and Griffith enter Karthieser and Wagner into the real world of stealing and killing and druguse. Woods gets an A+ for his performance. Antoher Clark film that really pulls you in and you feel the characters pain and there lives. Lou Diamond Phillips has an interesting cameo as a gay mexican (nice eyemakeup Lou). Karthieser has his moments here and there in this crackling and mesmerizing film. So does Wagner as his miscarrigaing overdosed girlfriend. Griffith is equally good as the rest.

Needles are clean, the drug easy to find and the money easy to win. So, what's the point ? I'm too tired to try to discover the hidden intentions of the director so I'm ready to concede that the relation between the middle-aged couple (Woods-Griffiths) and the younger one is highly symbolic. You see, Woods and Griffiths cannot have children so...

1219354,4,B00000IBKT,"Another Day in Paradise is a stylish mix of filth and flash, of violence and jazz. It's a colorful, clever and compelling picture that poses the intricate question of whether an outlaw life of crime is sumptuous or ruinous. Based upon Eddie Little's lustful, fresh and fierce novel, director Larry Clark, who has evidently anointed himself the American cinema's poet of decadence, finding special interest in the tension generated by kids in danger, gives us a raw, non-glamorized look at the bleaker regions of American squalor. He does so very well, and yet gives his film a name that subverts the true superficial irony that lies within, luckily to then, however, generate a greater impact viewers like myself weren't initially up for, and yet once experience, develop a whole new kind of perspective and a whole new kind of respect for. Aside from the seemingly innocuous-enough-of-a-name, ""Kids"", which gave a false impression to many parents, as such a wildly controversial film offered a non-blinking look at the dehumanizing rituals of growing up, his latest film, which is based upon a true story, is entitled ""Bully"", a rather frivolous name which, though may develop an assumption in one's mind-who doesn't follow Clark's work, mind you-that it'll merely be some other light-hearted family feature that would be of a primary choice for elementary teachers arranging a special period that would give students the privilege of watching a film than to work, it in fact regards a group of teens whom, after growing weary of being aggravated upon by the school bully, lure him to a swamp where they then beat him to death. That's not funny or suitable for a class by any means. That's appalling...that's life, portrayed upon kids in the grimmest and grittiest ways.
And here you have this one, which is entitled ""Another Day in Paradise"", but, as looks can very much so be deceiving, so can words. We know that the good times can't last, that it isn't going to be this glorious life for the foursome couple, who'll forever get the easy way out of each robbery, and then celebrate by going to fancy restaurants, getting drunk and shooting up once getting back to their apartment, for they ultimately endure the vast effects such a lifestyle has as they wind up on the verge of death's door, which sadly even opened for some of them. I mean, even in the beginning of the film you know that it isn't exactly going to be a pleasant one, as it opens with Bobby after having made love with the love of his life, Rosie, who, in order to support both her and himself, breaks into a junior college to burglarize a vending machine, merely to then find himself face-to-face with a security guard, who badly wounds him and yet, after a fierce fight, is defeated as Bobby stabs him to death with a crowbar. Soon he's being treated by Uncle Mel. ""Are you a doctor?'' he asks. ""Yeah, sure. I'm a doctor shooting you up with heroin,"" says Mel, satirically, and their chemistry progresses from there. (So does the story.)
The bond between Mel and Bobby was greatly alluring to me. In a sense, Mel was like a father to him, the loving father he never had-as dysfunctional as one can be-but a father nonetheless. As the film deepened and their friendship grew stronger, he had such empathy toward this poor little delinquent without many shoulders to lean onto, that it really fractures you to see what a pitiless and self-indulged man that allegedly loving father turns out to be in the end, when all hell broke loose and there was a real dark revolution with regards to this man's motives and abilities. As the conclusion to the synopsis on both the back of the VHS and DVD package say: But, he's a junkie on the make, and that doesn't mean that he can't use Bobby-and it sure doesn't mean he can't ditch him when he's done. What can I say? It's a tough world out there. If you're not tough enough, you aren't ever going to make it out alive.
Switching from working on G and PG-rated family features such as Alaska and Masterminds, to grittier and much more arresting R-rated adult, Vincent Kartheiser proves that he's a true actor that will not be afraid, or rather be incapable of taking on new rolls that would entirely alter his self-image to others. But unfortunately, he remains to be quite underrated, despite the deliverance of such powerful, such breathtaking performance, because throughout the last half-hour of the film, that was something in which he had definitely not failed to do. Such distinguished critics as Roger Ebert say things like how the performances are really what make this film worthy of watching, as the story was something in which he can easily anticipate, and then got specific as to why he enjoyed all the heart and soul James Woods and Melanie Griffith put into this picture, but neglected to even bother referring to Kartheiser, who I think outstaged them all! This kid is like the next Leonardo DiCaprio. (Or rather, adult. I know that he no longer wants to be refereed to as being a kid, for he really no longer is, neither is his work meant for any.) Kartheiser has matured into a young, gifted man.",1001548800,2,5127,4.716833890746934
1219355,5,B00000IBKT,"Honestly, I didn't go to a movie theater, nor did I buy the movie. I didn't find out about the haunting thriller until a few weeks ago. I now realize that the movie Another day in Paradise has been airing on cable television for some time now, where I live. What threw me off from the beginning, causing me to question the movie, was the time period it took place. I now know that the movie was based on incidents in the 70's, but before this was clarified for me, I just thought of the characters living in the 90's as retro, olden days wannabes. There is no indication whatsoever that the movie takes place in the 70's. The blues music and old tunes give you a suspenseful hint, but the familiar faces and the All-American look to the main characters makes you think more recent and current ( from my point of view at least.)
Something I found extremely interesting about the movie, was the acting within the wild and deranged lifestyle in which the characters lived. I was baffled by many scenes in the film. Some scenes are challenging and difficult to demur. For instance, there were up close shots of Griffith (Sid) sticking needles in her neck and the side of her crotch. And throughout certain portions of the movie, during partying and drinking, you begin to wonder...are these people acting? Or at they really high and drunk? Even now I can't tell. And if the characters really weren't on drugs and addicted to alcohol, they are very talented artists when it comes to acting skills. Put it that way. The movie can be considered a wake up call, so to speak. You get to see how torn people, living as junkies, become. The movie will make you wary to drink even a glass soda or eat a piece of rock candy.
The movie was shot using only the light of the natural sun, giving the movie a ""documentary"" type feel. This is another issue I misunderstood about the movie. I understand what Larry Clark wanted with the movie. And I get the point he was trying to portray, by using his natural light and up close head shots, but I think that his effect is not made for certain movies, including Another Day in Paradise. I congratulate Clark for reaching his goal of making a movie featuring realism, but his mixture of realism and his unclear time period makes a confused viewer. The movie doesn't look like it takes place in the 70's, but was filmed in the 70's. The reason why I didn't watch the movie the first few times it aired on TV, was because it looked old and unappealing. The movie has a harsh, gritty, and dirty appeal to it, due to Clark's requested effects. I think he should have used some other light source. Even if it was the smallest amount of added light he could get, because the movie is so dull at times it seems as if it was filmed in a pitch black cave, with the only light source being an unorganized and unsteady flashlight.
I may have pointed out some of the flimsy and weak spots in the movie, but don't get me wrong. The movie is absolutely brilliant. I think the most captivating quality in the movie is the love. The representation of the love is amazing. And the actors are all wonderful in their own unique way. I think the relationships and bonds in the movie are shockingly strong. The teens in the movie are what caught my attention most. Bobbie and Rosie maybe huge junkies, who don't have much to say for a future, but the one thing they have in the movie that not even heroin can take away, is their love. And even though they are acting to be in love, their affectionate touching and lip to lip whisperers makes your heart reach out to them, and fall in love along with them. Mel (Woods) was wonderful in the movie, but I'd have to say that Bobbie was the dynamic character and the star. Because in the movie the characters stay pretty static, and remain the same, except Mel, who changes, but not nearly with as much emotion as Bobbie. Bobbie (Kartheiser) was terrific in every way possible. For one thing, he was not too much of a character; too dramatic. He was a slender guy, who didn't have the most amazing body, but had a face that held such innocence he could be mistaken for a girl. Don't let his sweet guise fool you though, he is not nearly as innocent as he appears. He was a splendid actor in the movie because he was able to change his moods in a very realistic way. And something special about him was, he didn't have to say much. His facial expressions and eyes told stories of their own. I found it shocking that his girlfriend, Rosie (Wagner) was about ten years older than him in real life. She was about 28 during the time the movie was filmed, he was more like 18.
The ending of the movie disappointed me. I'd rather it have a cheesy, predictable ending, than an ending that leaves you nowhere. So much happens, and then it just ends without any conclusion. This movie contains an ending that would make you think Another Day in Paradise 2 is coming soon. And I hope it is. All in all, Another Day in Paradise is an excellent movie in my opinion. It has a spark in it that cannot be figured out. I am not a squeamish person, and I can take violence, sexuality, and profanity. It doesn't bother me. But if someone were to get offended by the content in the movie, I would understand why. I give this movie 5 stars. It's packed with action and drama, all which I love.
Now as a side note. I am a 16-year-old female. And I'm sure by telling you this you get a different perspective of the review I wrote. The question is no longer what rating and review I give this movie. The question is, what does my parents think of me watching such a drastic movie...",992390400,,5611,4.360076408787011

I suspected this before, but having seen this movie I have decided no other actor in the business can come close to him when it comes to playing a sleazy hustler-type. Or just a sleaze.
Anyway, he and the rest of the cast of the movie are great. Melanie Griffith, not a favorite of mine, does her best performance I've yet to see as Sid, Mel's junkie girlfriend with a heart of gold, a woman who can shoot smack directly into her neck without flinching but who can also sing a sweet lullaby to soothe Natasha Wagner's emotionally immature character. Yes, she can act- I finally had to admit it to myself in the last 20 minutes of the movie when she very realistically portays a woman whose entire world is finally falling apart, and who has to make some serious decisions.
  The movie's plot (based on the book by Eddie Little) concerns a young drug-addicted couple named Bobby and Rosie, who survive on petty crime. Bobby's luck finally runs out while he is trying to jimmy a vending machine, and by the time he gets home to Rosie, he is in pretty bad shape. Fortunately, his ""Uncle Mel"" is called over to patch him up and shoot him full of narcotics. Mel and his girlfriend Sid decide to take the young couple under their wing, and teach them to become career criminals like them. They have fun at first, but...
  I especially liked the way the movie does not glamorize drug use--the characters all look like cr-p, and Wagner's character has spotty skin and thinning hair. I was really expecting throughout the movie that all the 4 main characters would end up dead,  (probably from finally killing one another), but this didn't happen--the people left alive at the end were not the ones that I thought would be. I don't recommend this movie if you are squeamish about any of the following: needles and injections (my husband is, and actually got up and left the room), seeing heroin use portrayed in a very realistic light, or James Woods dressed like a pimp.
  All the actors did the movie for scale and from what I understand Woods even ended up funding most of the movie when the production ran out of money at one point.  Lots of good black humor, and Woods is always great in everything, but best when cast in really nasty roles like this, which was probably written for him. As usual in this type of part, he's completely disgusting, but still somehow likeable (at least for the first 2/3 of this movie), and always hilarious. Some of the clothes that Griffith and Wagner wear are to die for (though they look more late 60's than 70's if you wanna get picky, but who cares?)
  This is also one of those drug movies such as ""Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"" or  ""Clean and Sober"" where, if you had any temptation at all to do drugs in the first place, that urge will definitely be gone by the end of the movie. I didn't even feel like even drinking a frikkin' glass of wine again after I saw this.
  But apart from being a subtle ""just say no"" movie, I found it entertaining overall, enough to purchase it. Recommended for Woods fans, and adult (this is not a movie for kids) fans of Griffith's who would like to see her in something very different.",971222400,25,3284,4.462437395659433

The directing was outstanding as well.

7909650,5,B00000IBKT,"One of my favorite movies... Just realized that Bobby is Pete from mad men. Anyways, as someone who's lived and survived in a world of crime I can say a lot of this movie is realistic. Not the death so much as random violence, drugs, overdosing and drama. It's common for couples to work as teams. Normally, something a crime spree ensures and the only thing that'll stop it is incarceration or some other dramatic life alerting event. James woods is the prefect conman type. Melanie excels at playing the sly sidekick to woods.",1467072000,2,528,4.627659574468085
