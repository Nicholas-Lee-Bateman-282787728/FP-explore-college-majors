920912,5,6304725582,"When I was 8 I saw this movie and thought it was awesomely funny, cuz it was not only an obvious parody, but it wasn't a bunch of sluts running around in mini skirts like some think. These girls kicked butt. They may not have been smart, but they still took care of themselves. Cute movie.",1267228800,,289,4.178571428571429
920913,1,6304725582,"A mildly entertaining bit of fluff that almost has enough story to carry off its purpose -- to show three beautiful women. Unfortunately, the acting and sets are terrible. It's the type of movie adolescent boys from the early 1960's watched to get their thrills.",1185926400,,262,4.844444444444444

920915,2,6304725582,"This film was disappoitingly not funny, to the point I found myself asking whether it was really a parody of a B-movie or was it actually attempting to be serious... The jokes were just not funny (were they trying to make jokes?).",1141430400,,230,4.5
920916,1,6304725582,"My wife and I love  funny-bad bimbo movies.  Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is one of our favorites, and we love anything by Andy Sidaris.
This one just reaks.  The dialog is flat and the people don't look like they had fun making it.  Rent it, don't buy it.  Yech.",1088640000,6,280,4.2075471698113205
920917,5,6304725582,"When you start out to make a bad film and it is truly bad, you've actually created high art. So many people set out to make good films that ultimately fail. Why aim so high when you can create a classic like ""Killer Bimbos""?
I was actually startled to find this film had been transferred to DVD. It's one of those films that you watch with your friends and end up laughing yourself sick.
The basic premise of the film is about a couple of go-go dancers who are mistakenly fingered for offing their sleazy boss. While on the run from the police, they ""rescue"" Darlene, a trackstop waitress and attempt to find Mexico. During this ridiculous escapade, one of the girls feels she isn't very pretty and the ringleader decides that the middle of the desert is a great place for a makeover.
There are some amazingly stupid lines that are so funny that you will find yourself quoting them at some point down the road.
Do yourselves a favour and pick up this gem. It's only $9.98 and worth every penny. I was well chuffed to find this one. Now, if they could only get the classic ""Nice Girls Don't Explode"" with Barbara Harris, Michelle Meyrink and Wallace Shawn onto DVD, my life would be complete!",1068422400,3,1191,4.467889908256881
920918,5,6304725582,"This film predated Thelma and Louise by a few years and surely served as a model for that film without being credited as such.
It received justly high reviews by prominent crtics.e.g, Roger Ebert.  Elizabeth Kaitin, who went on to become a soft core staple, does an excellent job.  No eplicit sex here",1022198400,11,301,4.660377358490566

7876831,4,6304725582,"Extremely cheesy and laughable, but that's the point. I caught this one on TV during the late 80s and loved it at the time, so there's a bit of nostalgia as well.",1455321600,,162,4.09375

7876835,3,6304725582,"I saw this film on cable television decades ago. I remembered that it was so bad, it was incredibly funny.
It still is!
This film has no message, a hokey plot ( of two bimbos being framed for a mob hit ) and a conclusion that looked as though the writers didn't know how to end it.
But it is played for laughs, and laughs there are, aplenty, which isn't bad for something so obviously low budget.",1421020800,,396,4.1558441558441555

7876837,1,6304725582,"Well, I guess it rated R just for laughs as there is not enough skin even for rating PG. Yes, chicks are ugly, stupid and acting accordingly. The producer, accordingly, rolls movie smoothly to nowhere. As you may imagine the movie about bimbos will include some kind of sexual innuendo--wrong. It is exactly what the title says and that's include female producer. Avoid.
The cover picture should have producer somewhere.",1379635200,,420,5.014285714285714
7876838,4,6304725582,"Assault Of The Killer Bimbos is my new guilty pleasure movie. It's dumb and light as a feather, but it's also fun and campy with some lively performances from the actresses who play the bimbos. Fun for fans of those movies that used to come on USA Up All Night.",1301875200,4,261,4.24
