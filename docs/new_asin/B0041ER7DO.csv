8412626,4,B0041ER7DO,"I'm a person who enjoys his horror movies, and I'm always on the look-out for something new, something different... ""Help"" was a decent thriller, well made, but I'm not going to call it highly original. In fact, there were many references to Japanese horror, particularly ""The Grudge"" (once you see them, you'll recognize them). And this movie wasn't without its implausibility (without making my review a complete spoiler, I'll just say... What happened to the water from the broken pipe at the climax of the movie?). However, there have been worse movies out. I rather enjoyed this one, despite its imperfections. Perhaps there are other gems out there in the undiscovered (for me, anyway) world of Bollywood horror.",1428969600,,718,5.093220338983051
8412627,5,B0041ER7DO,"I have always loved ""scary"" movies even though I very rarely find them scary.  I will also admit that I'm an American that loves Bollywood movies.  That being said, I loved this movie & think you will too.  There is no singing & dancing in this movie (my fiancee thought all Bollywood movies had to have songs, silly boy!).  There were at least 3 times that I jumped/was surprised so that's nice for a scary movie pro like me.  They did a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat, making it creepy, & keeping you guessing.  It was a little slow at times but they really build up the suspense.  I don't want to spoil the movie so I'm not going to describe it.  All I will say is, at the end I was like ""whoa"" that's a new twist I haven't seen, well played Bollywood, well played.",1396396800,3,784,4.145695364238411
