7855219,5,6303924662,We had recieved this as a gift about 2 years ago and still love it.  Very educational and fun to go behind the scenes and watch the zoo staff care for the animals.,1106697600,3,163,3.9393939393939394
7855220,5,6303924662,"As a special educator, I found this to be an excellent way of preparing my high school disabled students for our trip to the zoo.  The pace, graphics and overall presentation was excellent and well-suited for any special ed class or elementary class.  I thought the video was very comprehensive as it not only showed what a day would be like going to the zoo, but also showed ""behind the scenes activities"". The special bonus was especially fun for all of us.  Truly an exceptional video for young students and those with special needs.",984009600,6,536,4.680851063829787
