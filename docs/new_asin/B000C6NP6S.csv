8095998,1,B000C6NP6S,"It's not that the cast is that bad, but this movie pretty much sucks, just too annoying after a while. I like the style of movie but this is just too lame, same kind of dialog over and over and it wears on you, and the story is stupid too.",1524960000,,239,3.8
8095999,5,B000C6NP6S,"Scruffy sniveling weakling two-bit criminal Alex (a perfectly wimpy Bill Osco, who also co-produced the film) and his equally foul, more hard-nosed no-count vicious partner Ray (a marvelously mean portrayal by Jason Williams of ""Flesh Gordon"" infamy) are a couple of pathetic low-life hoodlums who wind up killing four cops when a coke deal for $100,000 bucks goes completely awry. Man, does this baby have all the right tasty ingredients to qualify as a hugely enjoyable piece of vintage funky 70's drive-in exploitation junk: bluntly efficient direction by Walter R. Cichy (who also wrote the terse, concise script), a steady pace, raw, gritty, unpolished cinematography by Howard Ziehm, exciting occasional outbursts of gory action (none other than future Oscar winner Rick Baker did the bloody make-up f/x), a sappy folkie theme song, coarse, profane, priceless dialogue (sample line: ""Why don't you snort a little dope; maybe it'll calm you down""), a little cheesy soft-core sex, a hard, no-nonsense and downright sadistic harsh tone, a spare, moody score by Hal Yoergler, a stirring last reel car chase, engagingly scrappy acting from a game no-name cast (James Nite in particular contributes a hysterical performance as a hapless ice cream man), a beautifully bleak bummer ending, and even a handy helping of rape, gratuitous nudity and degradation. An unjustly neglected gnarly little trash movie nugget.",1523059200,,1412,5.364864864864865
8096000,4,B000C6NP6S,"COP KILLERS (1973) is about two hippie-types, named Ray (Jason Williams) and Alex (Bill Osco). After buying a satchel full of a suspicious white powder, the duo believe they've hit the big time. Oh dear! A police roadblock has come between them and their dreams! After a bloody shootout, Ray and Alex emerge, unscathed, and far better armed! They hit the road, while groovy music plays. Soon, they're meeting ""chicks"" and stealing an ice cream truck! The unlucky driver is dispatched to tasty treat heaven! These guys are no good, man! They're ruthless, hairy, and out for blood! No one in their path is safe. More murder, along w/ robbery and kidnapping follow! Will anyone survive their maniacal run for the border? Their abductee, Karen (Diane Keller), is put through a living hell, as Ray shows how crazy he really is! Can Alex, the not-as-bananas crook, manage to keep himself and Karen alive? A cheap production, this movie is filled w/ fun stuff like haphazard sound, a stock travel-log musical score, hit-and-miss ""acting"", visible under-the-shirt microphones, visible production crew, etc. Regardless, it's an effective enough piece of early 70's crime drama. My favorite part is when they arrive at the hippie hive / drug den. The two wasted women are a stoned-out hoot, and their giant, Sasquatch boyfriend is a bearded wonder! The final chase / showdown is bleak and satisfying...",1521331200,,1392,5.03030303030303
8096001,3,B000C6NP6S,"Alex (Bill Osco) and Ray (Jason Williams) are two drug transporters making their way across the desert with their product on their way to meet a buyer. Along the way they kill cops, people, high jack cars and take Karen (Diane Keller) as hostage. The film is pure 70's cult action. Hippies, telephone booths, and 33.9 gas. The soundtrack is dorky too.

The film is not for serious viewers, but 70's Drive-In cult fans.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Diane Keller, Donna Stubbert, Judy Ross- only movie credit for all three actresses, not a career builder)",1406937600,2,562,4.84375
8096002,3,B000C6NP6S,"this is typical of the early 70's ""roughie"" type of story. the bad guys are creepy and unlikeable and the plot just involves them driving around doing what they want killing when they feel. It was cheaply made in Tucson and would interest you if you have a ""thing"" for Drive-In/Grind house movies of the era",1300406400,,307,4.5
8096003,4,B000C6NP6S,"This is the kind of crime movie that Blue Underground and NoShame should be putting out. From the striking and original opening sequence you know this movie is going to please. Early gore effects work by one Rick Baker adds to the fun, as two Cop Killers hit the road in various vehicles. This is a fun low budget movie that genre fans should enjoy. I'm not going to spell out the plot or what happens as I don't want to spoil your enjoyment, but if you like this kinda of thing you will not be disappointed.",1154563200,4,508,4.247422680412371
