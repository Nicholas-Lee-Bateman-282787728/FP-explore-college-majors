8012296,5,B0001GH6X2,"As per usual, this Kali Ray is so relaxing and meditative, I feel like I'm taking a short vacation.  I like the flows from one move to the other repetitively...it feels like your body is meditating.
It is not ""power yoga"" or ""strength building"", but it does feel like my mind and body are connecting with each other through breath.  I love it!",1207612800,3,343,4.428571428571429
8012297,4,B0001GH6X2,"Hi, I started Kali Ray TriYoga three months ago and I bought that DVD to deepen my practice. I have never practiced Yoga before so I cannot say something about this style in comparison with the others. However I love the soft and gentle moves of Kali Ray TriYoga.

The DVD has four parts. First breath exercises, then Kali Ray goes very slowly through the different poses of the sun salutation. She really has a very nice and soft voice. Then the sun salutation is repeated in a natural rhythm and finally deep relaxation.

I give only four stars because two things bothered me. First, the sun salutation is simplified from what I learned i.e. no mountain. Second, I did not like that the practices take mainly place on a tennis court. However you can see the sea and palms in the background. Anyway, I would have preferred another location since Yoga means for me relaxation and tennis effort.

Still a very good DVD for beginners and people who want some company during Yoga.",1091750400,7,977,4.603448275862069
8012298,5,B0001GH6X2,This video is awesome! This is the perfect Yoga! Kali Ray is amazing and I am going to try more of her videos. I read someone else's review...about no downward dog...maybe they don't know that every system of Yoga may have different names for positions. I love this Yoga! It is superior to any other kind of yoga I have tried! I can't wait to do more. I use this every morning to get my day started out right! Thanks Amazon for offering this video at such an affordable price! Love it!,1087171200,10,485,4.282608695652174
8012299,1,B0001GH6X2,"This DVD is the worst DvD I have. It show you the sun salutation in the most basic way, no down facing dog, no cobra,no ay other options. the first 19 minutes she expleins, the poses so slowly and bored. the 40 minutes after that,she repites he sun salutation over and over with one leg and then the other for the lunges, but what get my so upset isshe does not give you any modification so you can progres, so she is doing it always the same way. Don waste your many on this DVD!!",1081728000,9,481,4.073684210526316
