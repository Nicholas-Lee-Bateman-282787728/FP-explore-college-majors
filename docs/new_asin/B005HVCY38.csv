8473649,5,B005HVCY38,"At this point, I've watched all of season 1 and most of season 2 - and I'm hooked. It started off rather slowly, with early episodes feeling more like a bundle of loosely related skits. Interim deputy manager Julie wasn't a very sympathetic character, and we didn't really get to know many characters in depth. By the end of season 1/beginning of season 2, however, the show had really begun to hit its stride. Storylines began to intersect more, and we started to get more insight into different characters.

I started watching this after finishing Gavin and Stacey, Coupling, and Trivia (Irish), and I loved the way all those shows really got into the characters and had a warmth to them. I almost abandoned Trollied because I didn't think it was going to get to that point, but it did. Definitely stick with it until you've seen at least the first several episodes of season 2.

One final positive note about this show is that - like many British shows - the characters are a nice cross section of real people. If you've ever watched American television and found yourself bored with either the endless procession of perfect models or the trend of overweight, unsuccessful men somehow landing the hottest and most successful women around, you'll enjoy that Trollied has a much needed dose of realism. Bodies aren't perfect, teeth aren't blindingly white, and characters are all over the spectrum in terms of age and looks. The acting talent is top-notch across all of them, though.",1464134400,,1484,4.79296875

8473651,5,B005HVCY38,"Here is another in a long line of great British sit-coms. The writing, acting, and filming are all wonderful. I highly recommend this.",1378252800,,134,4.869565217391305
8473652,3,B005HVCY38,not as funny as i thought it may be. very average comic content.  just not as funny as expected. but my choice to try it.  won't buy season two.,1360454400,,144,3.9310344827586206
8473653,5,B005HVCY38,"Like The Office, only in a supermarket. Between high strung Julie's awkward infatuation with store manager Gavin, the will they won't they of Katie and Kieran, blowhard butcher Andy, ditsy and slightly senile yet lovably sweet deli counter operator Margaret, idiot Leighton, the lazy piggishness of both Colin and Lisa, and the silly banter of customer service ladies Sue and Linda, it really makes for a great show with plenty of laughs. Can't wait to get my hands on series 2, and they're slated for a 3rd.",1358380800,,508,4.850574712643678
8473654,4,B005HVCY38,"""Trollied"" is a TV sitcom set in the Warrington store of a fictional budget supermarket chain, 'Valco'. The 8-episode series was written and produced by Ash Atalia, whose production credits also include the original UK version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-IT-Crowd/dp/B001NOMOS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The IT Crowd</a>"", giving most (British) TV viewers a fair idea of what to expect here.  The humour in ""Trollied"" is less off the wall than in ""The Office"" and not as cliquey as appears in ""The IT Crowd"", providing a comedy show aimed at a much wider demographic, poking as much fun at the Great British Public (in the form of supermarket customers) as it does at the Great British Worker. (I couldn't help thinking that not enough use was made of customers in the series; a lost opportunity that I hope will be addressed in later series.) It also uses a larger cast of main characters than either of the other shows (providing more scope for inter-character interaction over the series). In the best tradition of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Being-Served/dp/B002I9TZHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Being Served?</a>"" (with which it shares many similarities) it relies largely on the crude and the rude for the majority of its laughs.

The show has a strong cast who manage to imbue a not particularly sparkling script with more panache than it really contains and who bring the characters (caricatures though they be) fully to life. Series 1 was a great hit with BSkyB audiences, and two more series have been commissioned. While it isn't a great show by any means, it nevertheless has some truly great moments, made even more so by the fact that almost everyone who watches it will have experienced something akin to them themselves in their local supermarket (although I doubt that many who work in supermarkets would recognise much of the working environment portrayed here).

The series is beautifully shot, and has high production standards. The 2-DVD set includes all 8 episodes, a handful of interesting ""about the show"" extras and a collection of out-takes. It is well worth a look.",1324512000,,2345,5.752161383285302
8473655,3,B005HVCY38,"Trollied is set in a fictional supermarket, Valco in the North of England. It sports quite a well known cast who do their best given the limitations of the script they were presented with. This is really quite a light weight offering in that there are no real plots of any significance and the episodes are, in the main a series of one liners. Some of the gags are really rather good though.

I have to say that Valco's staff and their level of customer care (or lack of it) on occasion put me in mind of the cast at our local supermarket which shall remain nameless. For me this was one of the funnier aspects of the show.

I ended up watching this just before bedtime, as the 30 minute episodes are fine when you do not want to get engrossed in something new for hours, and you do not want anything which is going to stimulate the mind too much just before sleep. I think that about sums it up really!",1322006400,,903,4.213872832369942
8473656,5,B005HVCY38,"This brilliant new series is probably the best comedy I've seen come out of the UK since The IT Crowd.  Jason Watkins of the BBC's Being Human (not SyFy's deplorable remake) stars as Gavin the store manager of the fictional Valco supermarket and its group of dysfunctional employees.  This series is hilarious and very entertaining, so much so that series 2 and 3 were confirmed and in the works before series 1 had ended.  It's a shame we can't have this level of writing and quality programming here in the states.  I can't wait until this series gets a region 1 release!",1321488000,,573,4.588235294117647
