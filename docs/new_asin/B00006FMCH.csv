7968075,3,B00006FMCH,"Crimson stars Paul Naschy as a criminal gang leader who undergoes a radical surgery. When a jewel robbery goes awry, Jack Surnett (Paul Naschy) and his fellow thieves take shelter at the home of a scientist experimenting in brain replacement. Through the surgical skill of the doctors wife (Silvia Solar), Surnett is restored to health but suffers an irresistible thirst for blood and conventional lust after the brain of a criminal known as The Sadist (Roberto Mauri) is grafted onto his own.

The movie ambitiously blends heist flick, revenge thriller, and mad scientist horror inspired by Mary Shelleys Frankenstein even though the mad scientist aspect had been tapped many times before, primarily in Universal and Columbia B-pictures of the 40s and numerous low-budget science-fiction movies of the 50s. Despite its efforts, Crimson comes off as a tepid effort, lacking either real scares or atmosphere. Naschy is known for more flamboyant roles. In Crimson, he has little to do other than lie half-dead in bed most of the time.

This edition includes both the 89-minute American release version, dubbed in English, as well as the extended 98-minute European version alternately titled The Man With the Severed Head (in French, with English subtitles), which features additional, sexually provocative footage.

The Blu-ray release is mastered in HD from original 35-mm film elements. The only bonus feature is audio commentary by horror film historian Richard Harland Smith.",1465603200,2,1478,5.334763948497854
7968076,5,B00006FMCH,"I just want to add, for anyone who might stumble upon this, that in the extras for this dvd, there is a black-out occurring about 8 minutes into the bonus footage, and it lasts several minutes.  I wrote Image to see if this was a defect on my personal copy, and they responded that this defect was apparent in the original negative source, and therefore is present on every copy of the dvd.  I've asked other persons who own this dvd if their copies possess the same defect, but no one ever responds, so keep that in mind.  It is doubtful that another release of this film will ever come to fruition, so its hardly a complaint, but it just happens to occur in a pivotal scene involving the most interesting character in the movie.  Why then, was this segment even included??",1183075200,3,774,4.429577464788732
7968077,2,B00006FMCH,"Being a huge fan of Mr. Werewolf himself, the great Spanish actor Paul NASCHY, I really wanted to like this one, particularly as I had read favorable reviews of this DVD before purchasing it. But alas, it was a disappointment.

Paul NASCHY is the leader of a bunch of gangsters, who break into a jewelery store. Since these gangsters are not the brightest, they manage to set off the alarm and are forced to flee. As the gangsters are driving around a police roadblock, the cops open fire and hit NASCHY in the head, who promptly gets comatose. In their hideout, the gangsters decide to get help from a down-on-his-heels doctor. This general practioner of course meets the job requirements for doctors who cure baddies in movies (i.e. he is an incompetent drunkard). When sober, the doc suggests to ask one of his colleagues (who experiments with brain transplants) for help. On they go and after a little ""persuasion"" the professor agrees to help them. He suggests to conduct a brain transplant on the unlucky NASCHY. Now where do they find an organ donor? It is agreed upon to kill the gangster's archenemy, the aptly named mobster ""Sadist""...After the hapless unvoluntary organ donor loses life and brain, the operation is conducted in the professor's basement (!). But while NASCHY very slowly recuperates, the Sadist's men are closing in on the gang, and to make matters even worse, there are unexpected side effects to the treatment...

Now really, I'm not making this up! As you my brief synopsis indicates, this FRANKENSTEIN inspired yarn (the brain transplant) is not exactly what mainstream film critics will rave about. But while CRIMSON could easily have been a trash-fest for the Eurocult movie fan (like most other movies starring the great Paul NASCHY) this one is really a stinker. It is simply boring. Actors sleepwalk through the film and the atrocious English dubbing with the voice actors delivering their lines in a very monotonous way, re-enforces this  even more. NASCHY does not have much screentime, and even when he is on-screen, he is most of the time either comatose or recuperating. And his grotesquely bandaged head is unintentionally funny! Admittedly things live up a little towards the showdown, but it is too little too late. The score is absolutely awful and reminded me of sex films. Worst of all, the whole brain transplant thing does not really lead anywhere - the film could have been told as a straightforward gangster tale.

There are some extra features - the French trailer, a different opening scene and alternative erotic footage. This footage would be more in tone with a sleazy sex film and consists of some addtional ""hot"" scenes and alternative scenes, where more skin is to be seen than in the film (for example, towards the end one of the baddies discovers a dead girl in a cupboard - in the movie she is (scantily) clothed, in the alternate footage she is naked).

I'd recommend this DVD for die hard NASCHY fans and Euro cult completists only!",1148947200,5,2996,4.85518590998043
7968078,2,B00006FMCH,This film is a not atypical Naschy exercise in Euro-horror.  As such you may feel you have seen it all before (which may also make you happy). However the DVD suffers from having all the nudity crammed into the extras section- leaving the original  feeling expurgated.  Odd way to do this- which makes me want to await an uncut full run version of this movie.,1140393600,,359,4.492307692307692
7968079,4,B00006FMCH,"Criminals who rob banks should never try a risky brain transplant from a SADIST.  If they get injured, especially a brain injury, they should just pack it in.  If they decide to get an experimental brain surgeon to perform the operation then the new brain might not take and then you've just got a randy maniac killing machine on your hands.  Lock up the surgeon's wife and any european women that get within a mile of this freak even with bandages still on his head.  Eroto-cephalic pandemonium.",1131753600,,496,4.666666666666667
