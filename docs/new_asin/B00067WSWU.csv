8039967,5,B00067WSWU,"Rory Block puts her heart and soul into anything she produces, be it a guitar tutorial, a CD or a live concert.

I respect the passion and commitment, but sometimes when an artist pours themselves into a performance, it can distract the audience.

Rory probably lost ten pounds during this show, and the results sound amazing - it may sound cliche, but it's true - she's a national treasure.

My only quibble is that because of the year, this concert was shot in the old square aspect ratio - the picture quality is still pretty good, and the audio is excellent though.

This is a must-have for any fan of acoustic blues.",1518307200,,621,4.517857142857143

8039970,4,B00067WSWU,"Most people have heard of Bonnie Raitt.  Rory Block has been an acoustic blues guitar champion at least as long as Ms. Raitt and has the Blues awards to prove it !  Her interpretations of everyone from Robert Johnson,  Son House and Skip James as well as her original compositions make this in concert DVD an experience you won't soon tire of giving repeated viewings.  Her between song rapport with the audience in ST. Louis gives you that
intimate stage relationship missing from some concert DVDs.
  The recording quality is stellar.",1229212800,7,537,4.846153846153846
8039971,5,B00067WSWU,"I have been a fan for years and have several of her cd's.  I have a lot of the old blues in my music collection, many of the songs she covers. I just received this dvd in the mail today and after supper thought I'd scan through it before heading out the door to another commitment.  Needless to stay I never made it out the door! I found her performance absolutely stunning!  It is very evident that Rory Block puts her heart and soul into every single song!  From the raw power she puts into each cover and the sweet emotion she bleeds out of her own songs, her dazzling guitar technique, and her humbleness between each song!  Guitarists will be rapt watching her percussive strumming with feet pounding, head weaving and stinging slide on songs by Robt J., Son House, Tommy Johnson and others.  Her rappour with the audience setting up her own songs inspired by those who have touched her life and passed on.  And two accapella songs that leave you breathless!  On top of all this you find an artist who seems to be humble and genuine in her enthusiasm for sharing her gift with all of us.  Buy this moving performance....get comfy...and truly enjoy this great DVD!  The only complaint is that this night was cut too short (75 mins).....she states that she wanted to play much longer.  I hope she considers perhaps another DVD that can capture her doing a much longer set!",1112832000,24,1375,4.504032258064516
