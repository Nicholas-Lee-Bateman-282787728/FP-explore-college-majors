1640855,5,B00005OCLP,"Though it is titled ""The Princess and the Pea"", this movie is actually based on several stories by Hans Christian Anderson briliantly knitted together to form a cohesive whole.  Russian fairy-tale productions of the 60s and 70s are of very high quality and this is one of the best of the breed.  The photography, scenery, and music are of course spectacular.  Particularly noteworthy are the actresses who play the princesses in the various stories.  They are all beautiful, all but one charming, and have delightfuly quirky personalities.
One caution though.  The DVD has an alternative audio track with the dialog dubbed in English.  Disregard it.  If you don't understand Russian, use the English subtitles instead.  The English dubbing uses a slightly different script that has been designed to match the Russian lip movements.  Some of the characters as portrayed by the actors who dubbed the film come across as having different personalities.  This is particularly true of the hero's parents who reflect Russian culture in the Russian script but a weak knockoff of British culture in the dubbed soundtrack.",1026259200,48,1113,5.167597765363128
7948644,4,B00005OCLP,"Surprisingly cute and adorable! Though the title is somewhat misleading. The 'princess' in question has MAYBE 10 min of screen time. They really should have just called it 'The Prince Who Gets Disillusioned by Princesses'. Still, for a foreign film from the 70s, I sat through the entire thing, amused and entertained. I was expecting to abandon it 20 min in, but its just charming enough to hold my interest. Just remember to turn on the english subtitles!",1519948800,2,457,4.871794871794871
7948645,5,B00005OCLP,"This is a superior film of the fairy tale imagination by any measure. Subtitled, but easy to turn subtitles on. Children are actually a lot less rigid about subtitles than adults, so you may be surprised on that score. Completely appropriate for children. I have no idea what could be going through anyone's head to say otherwise. There's not even a hint of anything inappropriate that would be missed by children, but picked up by adults. [Like the last scene in Jacques Demy's Donkey Skin (Peau d'ne), which I consider a bit of a drag for that reason. Better to put on a DVD of The Young Girls of Rochefort (Les Demoiselles de Rochefort) for the kids to dance around and sing along with, rather than Peau d'ne.] Certainly The Princess and the Pea is a movie that takes on more depth of meaning for older children. The prince learns many things along the path in his journey into the world. The first princess he meets on his travels is an air head, the second harbors depth of feeling for another prince (and our hero selflessly helps them come together--a credit to his ability to empathize and mature), the third has a good heart but mistakes the destruction of art (and beauty) for its culmination. The prince returns home, and the story of the Princess and the Pea plays out as begun early in the story. The story is never heavy or scary. No blood. A couple chaste kisses, kisses on the cheek. For those interested in subtext, when he returns home the prince's mother is reading a French novel from 1699 (perfect for the fairy tale period), The Adventures of Telemachus. The novel was imagined as the educational journey of Ulysses' son and here the hero has returned from an educational journey after seeking a princess to love and claim.

The Princess and the Pea is remarkably accurate is conveying the feeling of some classic illustrations of fairy tales. The sense of interior space, topography, nature, architecture--all are the most accurate depictions I've seen on film of traditional fairy tale imaginings as illustrated by a number of British artists (perhaps Russian artists as well.) One of the reviews here has already expressed it very well, so I'll leave it at that.

Anyone having problems with subtitles should contact Amazon. I've only run into this problem with one web browser and I called Amazon to help me figure it out. If it's not working in your favorite browser, change browsers when you are watching Prime. Fire TV and the mobile Prime app always show subtitles. I'm really hoping we can educate the people who low-ball ratings on films based on some technical issue they couldn't figure out.",1518393600,,2625,4.741794310722101

7948648,5,B00005OCLP,"Entertaining and surprise of surprise the men are men and most of the women are women.  The men have broad shoulders and narrow hips and the women have short rounded shoulders and feminine faces.  There is humor, intelligence, innocence and familial love abound in this fairy tale story. The actor who plays the prince in search of his princess is uncommonly handsome with the most tender eyes.  The scenery is spot on for the time period when monarchies ruled Europe.  Truly a delightful escape from the crumbling society we face daily.",1503964800,2,537,4.868131868131868

7948650,5,B00005OCLP,"A lot of Russian fairy tales are a far cry from what you may think of when thinking of children's fairy tales. They are dark, they have scary visuals, they are often not happy tales. (What can better prepare you for the adult reality than fairy tales like Soviet ones?)

I watched this film as a child, and it haunted me for years. I grew up, I am an adult now, there was one scene in the movie that was etched on my heart to the point where I, a nearly middle-aged adult now, have spent the last 20 years looking for this film EVERYWHERE. And today I found it (thanks to someone who is a Russian fairy tale specialist).

This fairy tale is a lovely, not-entirely-safe-for-children, story made up of several Hans Christian Andersen's tales, beautifully interwoven into a coherent tale of love, magic, and beautiful costumes.

I am definitely buying the DVD, I don't want to not have this film to watch whenever. The obsession continues.",1491782400,7,936,4.559523809523809

7948652,5,B00005OCLP,"Russian fairy tales are quite different from others and this is no exception. It is much more Russian than Danish. In no way is it like a Disney film. It starts slow but gets very interesting as the prince journeys to find his princess. Each of the four princesses are gorgeous and totally ddifferent in persosnality. Naturally the prince finds his true love in his own ""backyard."" You can do much worse that check out some of the Russian fairy tales that are now on DVD in the states.",1099526400,11,485,4.46067415730337
