4327193,4,B004CJQVI0,"I love documentaries on the food movement.  I always find them interesting and while there is a lot of hype about it being propaganda at times, I find it all informative.  This particular food documentary was in regards to the local food movement.

In search of great ingredients, this documentary gets up close and personal with farmers, chefs, and other movers and shakers in the local food movement.  It explores getting people interested in sourcing their food locally.  The relationships between the chefs and farmers that coexist to provide seasonal food on a rotating menu and everything sounded fantastic.  It also explored introducing school age children to where their food comes from.  Several of the people interviewed talked about concerns with the seed industry and the high volume farming that isn't very sustainable and while small local sustainable farm methods are taking hold in the United States.  Overall the film was broken up into four parts titled by the seasons and revolving around the different aspects of farming in those seasons.

All the speakers were very informative.  They shared information clearly, listed out their beliefs on why they thought the way they did, and gave advice for those looking to join the movement.  There were a couple that made things sound like doomsday, which could be alarming, but as with all information, you have to be the final judge and look at the world around you before buying in to anything.  The information was good, the method of delivery was all that needed worked on.  Don't let that scare you away from this film though, it was overwhelmingly in the positive for most things.

Most people who aren't interested in this type of information or who don't believe the ideas shared by this film probably shouldn't bother watching it.  But for those who are interested in learning more or already know a bit about finding local food sources, this is a great documentary.  Experts in the field probably won't learn anything new, but it was interesting to listen to the different people talk about their experiences with local farming.  I know a little big about local sustainable farming and have recently started a large garden on my property myself so I found everything fascinating and want to look into more documentaries like this one to get an even bigger picture of what's happening with today's food resources.

Great informative documentary that should be enjoyed by any who like to have the best freshest possible ingredients that are farmed without hurting the land or destroying the eco-system.

4327198,5,B004CJQVI0,"Excellent documentary about why need to rely less on industrial farming. I believe that the film makes excellent points about growing in a sustainable manner. However, I would like to point out that sustainable farming is still a small portion of total farming and it will not change until sustainable farmers figure a way out to be more competitive. The good news is that there are more innovative farmers now and I remain optimistic that sustainable farming will make head ways. In terms, industrial farming, I do agree there are serious side effects but they do add a lot of value to our lives as wheat, beans, corn and soy are best produced in massive farming. As consumers, we should ask industrial farmers to produce more sustainable manner. Also, if you happen to be an investor let your voice be heard by trying to draft a proposal or contacting management (this is hard but it can be done).  Finally, you can invest in local farms by lending money to them through Kiva or Indiegogo.",1457136000,2,991,4.695402298850575

4327201,5,B004CJQVI0,"This movie brings up a good point.  More farming close to urban areas needs to be done so that they can provide fresh, organic NON-GMO, GLYPHOSATE FREE produce and livestock at lower prices.  Doing so is necessary if we are gong to continue to have fresh local organic food.  Whats sad is seeing just one person eating one bite of poisonous food from any fast food chain.  Its not the food you r eating that is bad but the QUALITY of it.  Food strictly for profit only equals death.  We can still make if we all get together and buy and eat only local organic non-gmo food at the store and at restaurants.  Money is power and it can be used to change things.  But it takes being aware and knowing whats right and what is worth fighting for.  Its our right to have abundant food that gives health and is free of toxic chemicals and ANY genetic modification.  Just think, the people who are responsible for all the toxins and genetic pollution, themselves only eat extremely organic produce and lifestock.  That right there should tell you something.",1455580800,2,1048,4.5212765957446805
4327202,4,B004CJQVI0,"Changes are needed with the way Americans grow and consume food. This film highlights the reasons and the benefits. Although, the film overlooked one key reason why our culture prefers industrialized food production: meal preparation time. This film only offers the solution that people suck it up and dedicate 60-90 minutes each day to cook. From a practical standpoint as a canned beans and boxed potato consumer, this film isn't helpful.",1455494400,,440,5.211267605633803

Little emphasize on cooking at home and more from the perspective of the relationship between farmers and restaurant buyers who are  ingenious enough to buy local.  But if a viewer watching this movie also  loves eating out, and would care to find the restaurants that use locally grown foods, they would be better for it. It is a lively presentation of the bonus of local farm food eating. It's the reason we want to preserve our non GMO farmers, if there are any left to be found in the US.",1433808000,,572,4.533980582524272

4327284,5,B004CJQVI0,"Yummy!  Fabulous and very, very interesting.  While watching, I renewed my commitment to shopping (and trading) exclusively with my local farmers market(s) and to continue to offer my little single CSA garden share that I have done in years past.  Also, it was really neat to see some of the local farmers that I've purchased from and also visited their farms in Oregon.  I think the only one I didn't recognize was the sheep farm in Junction City, but then again, I'm qn organic vegetarian. But, it was lovely viewing their healthy, happy sheep, ducks and cows anyway, even though I didn't want to eat them.  Also, this year I'm adding a Berky water filter to my garden to filter out the little know about chloromine, along with all of the other horrible things in our city water supply that would typically be used to water a garden (ugh).

4327300,3,B004CJQVI0,"Very interesting but one factor is glaringly absent: money. For example, the patronne of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, CA is shown speaking ardently of the wonders of fresh vegetables, but the film does not note that a prix fixe dinner at Chez Panisse, not including wine, tax, or tips, costs $85 per person, $100 on Saturday night. So likewise, a half bottle of chardonnay to wash it down costs $59. A couple that can get away with spending less than $250 for dinner there is being frugal. Of course they could spend much more, like washing down the wonderful local food with a French sparkling wine for $420 a bottle. There is also a rave segment about the Bergstrom organic winery in Oregon with no mention of the fact that a bottle of, say, their 2012 pinot noir is selling for $56.95 - you can get a bottle of an eminently drinkable (but non-organic) Bolla Italian pinot noir at your local supermarket for $8. Surely this film does not mean to suggest that local produce is essential to your health but unaffordable, yet that is the message I heard. Rich people live better than the rest of us. Who knew?

It is also kind of amusing, though really annoying, that several segments of the film are drowned in loud aggressive music and rushing images, creating the noise and visual pollution which are as bad for our health as factory food.

The moral? Grow your own food if you can, if you cant eat at Chez Panisse, and if you cant afford to do either, then, adopting the French which dominates this film, tant pis.",1428192000,3,1514,4.521897810218978

4327448,5,B004CJQVI0,"I was so impressed with this documentary, I viewed it twice within 24 hours.  Kudos to all the wonderful and talented individuals who are leading a long overdue movement to reverse the toxic damages in our food system. Every individual deserves good health and the solutions and answers are in our food. Food is medicine, and medicine is food.",1394582400,,343,4.813559322033898
4327449,5,B004CJQVI0,I found this to be well done and informative. It isn't long and flows nicely.  It presents the message without being preachy about it.  Well worth the time for anyone interested in the local food movement.,1394236800,,205,4.666666666666667
4327450,5,B004CJQVI0,This documentary was very educational and inspiring. Watch it if you want to know about the differences between mass production farming versus green farming. Support your local farmer's markets.,1393718400,,194,5.724137931034483
4327451,3,B004CJQVI0,It was an interesting look into local and family farms. Not too much new information or practical advice. Overall it was worth a watch.,1393545600,,135,4.666666666666667
4327452,5,B004CJQVI0,It is simply unbelievable what's in our food.  The degree that the food industry will sink to for profit is unconscionable.  This is definitely an eye opening documentary.  I highly recommend it.,1393286400,,195,5.03125
4327453,3,B004CJQVI0,It was a good documentary. More scientific explanation about food and human health would have given support to many statements made in this documentary.,1393286400,,152,5.375
4327454,4,B004CJQVI0,"Ingredients (Robert Bates, 2009)

I saw Ingredients in May of 2012. I finally started writing this review fifteen months later. I have no idea why it has taken me so long; of all the documentaries that tread this ground I've seen over the past couple of years (there have been roughly a half-dozen of them), Ingredients is by far the best, and the one that comes most highly recommended from this camp. I just never found any sort of in I could use to start writing about it, but now I'm at the point where I'm forcing myself to catch up with all the old reviews that should have gotten written months ago and never did. I guess my in is get your ass in gear, you lazy bum, and say something about Ingredients.

Most food-based documentaries these days start from the same basic premise: the American system of food production is broken. Some documentaries, mostly the inferior ones, simply use that as a springboard to attack what they see as the underlying problem. Therein lies their failure, at least in part: the idea that there is one underlying problem (increasingly, for lazy filmmakers, that is oh, no, GMO!) rather than a pervasive attitude, a system that infects everything from the growing to the distribution to the consumption. Given such a broken system, is it possible to find a solution? It is, and it's as easy as doing things the way we did things just a few decades ago, before it was as simple as it is today to fly foods around the globe or drive them across the country: eat what foods you can from providers as close to you as possible. Bates interviews a handful of farmers who have played key roles in vitalizing the locavore movement and lets the idea sell itself.

It might not have been the best way to go with this documentaryI've seen more than one review that called it pale (I even saw one that compared it unfavorably to the awful, awful Food Inc., so at least I know how much I can trust that reviewer's opinions in the future)but I thought it did the trick pretty well; it covered the ground without hammering the viewer into the dust, which is not something I can say about more than a few of the foodie docs I've watched over the past couple of years. Pity those who think a documentary isn't doing its job if it doesn't pound the viewer into the ground. And then avoid their reviews. (This is all relative, of course, I wouldn't be silly enough to try and posit the movie as having a light touch.) In short, well worth giving it a look; if it's not strident enough for you, asparagus knows there are enough other choices out there catering to the velvet-hammer crowd. *** ",1392595200,,2611,4.4789915966386555

4327457,5,B004CJQVI0,What a beautiful documentary. The photography alone made me want to be at a farmers market even though it is winter here in Wisconsin.

4327463,3,B004CJQVI0,"Pretty good food doc, I've watched a lot of these movies and they all say the same thing. It is a great introduction to the issues farmers face. The way out sounds great but no one ever really says how people in poverty can eat that way.",1390953600,,237,4.0638297872340425
4327464,5,B004CJQVI0,"This movie is on my list of recent recommendations for my friends. This movie represents a point of view that should be considered and taking into practice since I am on the opinion that you are what you eat. How I can make the difference is that I came from Eastern Europe where at the time that I grew up much of the food raising was done in a family traditional style. I think that in comparison to that time now my inability to control the food quality has made me sicker and unhealthier than the peers that I know that still use local farms that simply do not have the money to use a more modern production that involves heavy foraging for the cattle, GMO with combination of herbicides and pesticides that slowly make way into your body in one way or another.
My opinion is that sooner or later we are going to have the choice to be a part of one sustainable farming program or another with the chance to be able to get back to a more healthier food quality at the same time minimizing the impact on the nature and most importantly the farm-able soil.",1390608000,,1057,4.29

4327467,5,B004CJQVI0,"Ms. Boutard's comments at the 55:00 mark are 100% correct.  Given that much of our food supply is imported from 1000s of miles away, do you really feel secure with the way foreign countries handle and spray those crops you're now eating??  It's something to think about.  Maybe we  should buy more local and support our own.",1390003200,,324,4.631578947368421

4327474,3,B004CJQVI0,"Like most recent documentaries about our food, this film tells us why its important to buy fresh, organic food.  It was not the most informative film I've seen on the topic yet it was still pretty interesting.",1388707200,,209,4.648648648648648
4327475,5,B004CJQVI0,"There once was a time that I cared about the food that ate.. the way it tasted and how it was presented. As I grew older the speed of life (while I was still young and living at home), drove my family to be rather resourceful... eating out for many meals and always on the run. Since I am now married and hive kids of my own, I find the value of what we serve to be larger than I had ever thought. Sure, I do succumb to the all too frequent convenience of the drive-through... but the fresh ingredients that my wife brings in to the home are refreshing to my pallet. Having seen the first half of this movie thus far, it definitely is a growing grass roots movement that will feed the next generation and teach them the values of providing for their hearts, mind, body and soul.

Everything they say in this documentary is the truth that you will not hear from the mainstream media. It is nothing to hide from people, it is just awareness of the food system and why we should think differently than we have been, that's all it is. But just seeing and hearing people explain the why and what of moving toward a better way of growing food makes a powerful message. It is a very good documentary and easy to watch, you should try to watch it.",1384300800,,602,4.383928571428571

4327481,4,B004CJQVI0,"Farmers, chefs, activists and others are interviewed in the movement to grow and share safer agricultural methods and foods, but more importantly, taking power away from the large corporations and giving it back to the local farmers. The documentary rotates around the 4 seasons throughout the year and how this can easily sustain us. Even though there are many other films just like it I still recommend watching this as a consumer. Sometimes the information may not be new, but it should hit home, especially when many voices are expressing the same concerns! The information provided in the interviews is clear and concise; do not let the delivery of any of this information take away from the facts themselves! Unfortunately, most people knowingly eat crap regardless of whether or not the responsible thing to do is to take care of themselves and set a good example for the future. As many excuses as people come up with, the bottom line is: if there's a will there IS a way! Whether growing or maintaining your own crops and food, going directly to your local farms or strictly buying from a local organic store, it is possible to eat healthy.
As we all cohabitate on this planet, I think it is our responsibility to ensure not only the survival of a healthy human species, but a healthy eco-system for the animals and earth that we share everything with.",1384214400,,1361,4.771186440677966

I think if you've seen Food, Inc. and/or read any of Pollan's books, you will be bored with Ingredients, as it's pretty much the same message.  I found my attention wandering frequently.  If you haven't read any of those books or seen the films, then this may be completely new information to you and you might find it enjoyable.  For me, though, it was a repeat of a message I have already heard and already support.",1382054400,9,656,4.425

You will certainly look differently at the food you eat as well as rethink our farming industry.

Great shots of foods straight from the farm covered with earth, some interesting conversations with farmers, a definitive statement that knowing where your food was grown and how that impacts the land is essential to our survival as a species. A distinct lack of racial diversity in this doc (the scene of farm visits of an entire crowd of *only* white people going by on trucks is striking), but that's in part reflective of the lack of diversity in the local food movement. I know that there are PoC fighting some hard fights to get fresh local food into communities struggling under white supremacy, but they weren't shown at all. Wish they were. Also wish there was a greater diversity of voices than the focus on well-off restaurateurs. Oh well. Still one more contribution to a story that needs to be told.",1379376000,,857,4.758389261744966

4327520,3,B004CJQVI0,"I haven't researched the filmmaker. If this was their first doc then it was okay. The montage at the beginning was hard to watch - it was the standard good and bad. Image of happy person, image of sad person, image of unhealthy person, image of healthy person, image of fast food, image of fruit. Not innovative at all. Music is tough with documentaries (even Ken Burns seems to use the Civeil War soundtrack for most productions). The music combined with Bebe's narrative made it much like the school movies we watched in the 1970s. I found the conversations with chefs to be pretty interesting.",1368144000,,596,4.685714285714286

4327523,4,B004CJQVI0,"This documentary covers the benefits of sourcing your food locally and tries to squash (pun intended) the notion that you cannot feed yourself or your family with the majority of your food being grown locally. They discuss the fact that local food can often be more expensive, but they also discuss ways that this might improve in the future or ways that you can reduce that pocket bite. The use of farmers markets is encouraged for the majority of the diet and shows how not only families, but restaurants and food banks are able to feed their patrons with local food.

The documentary is centered around Portland, Oregon, but has interviews and features from New York, Ohio, and other places around the US. While the Pacific Northwest is known for it's abundance of food production, the theories presented here can be applied to almost any spot in the United States, and probably several other countries. The format is divided into seasons and discusses the products grown with the farmers during each season, what the farmers do during this time, and then moves on to speak with their consumers about how they use the product they've received.

Beautifully shot documentary with tons of regular folks talking about their love of food and how they hope to make the growing / supplying / eating cycle a more efficient and local system.",1366156800,14,1336,4.829694323144105
4327524,4,B004CJQVI0,"This movie works well as an introduction to the benefits of locally grown food, the challenges that face young farmers today (as well as the rewards from their endeavors), and the process of food production in the U.S. and abroad in general. Perhaps the most striking notion that is explored is that which I selected for the title of my review. As one person who is interviewed says, ""You can pay the farmer, or you can pay the doctor.""

They also go on to point out that one in three children born in the U.S. during the year 2000 will go on to develop diabetes, AND this is the first generation that is projected to have a shorter lifespan than that of its parents. I will take them at their word on this- in my daily life, I see a troubling amount of nutritional illiteracy, obesity, and poor health. I hope that watching this documentary might encourage some viewers to eat healthier and make changes that will improve their lives in every way (not only will you be healthier, but you'll be fuller and get to enjoy tastier food, too!), though I would recommend they first start with ""Hungry For Change"" and ""Food Matters"".

""Ingredients"" can come off as a bit ""dry"" for most of its duration, but I don't mind this at all. Rather than bombard the viewer with catchy music and flashy visuals as statistics are thrown about willy-nilly (as is the trend in most contemporary documentaries), this one remains very ""rooted"". I enjoy most documentaries, regardless of the presentation style they choose, but ""Ingredients"" stands out as one that is particularly sober in its delivery of the material in question.",1365292800,9,1608,4.678445229681979

4327535,2,B004CJQVI0,"Having grown up in a farming community in the Willamette Valley in Oregon, I thought this documentary made some valid points, particularly about the loss of prime farmland, but proposed solutions that are naive and unworkable.

The documentary argues for a return to agricultural practices that appear to date back to a time when the labor of 70% of the population was required to produce enough food to feed everyone. While the increased cost of those practices are sort of addressed, (apparently we need to just buck up and pay more plus, oh yes, massive government subsidies) the filmmakers are completely silent on the real issue of reduced yields. It was quite telling that the Oregon State professor they interviewed was from the Econ Dept., not the College of Agriculture.

So while it's lovely that the very wealthy suburb of Lake Oswego can afford to hire people to run what amounts to a community garden, that shouldn't be confused with agriculture that is tasked with producing adequate calories for billions of people using comparatively small amounts of land and labor.  Problems with modern agriculture certainly exist, but the solutions proposed by this film are tantamount to solving the congestion and pollution caused by traffic by having everyone switch back to using horses.",1361577600,28,1294,5.09433962264151

""Farm to Table"", ""sustainability"", ""decentralization of agriculture"" these are all the white peoples' arguments. This is not to say that these matters are not important--they're extremely important--but in context of poverty and malnutrition these feel good ""low hanging fruit"" narratives are and should be fringe.

In my neighborhood of East Harlem I literally have a hard time finding any sort of reasonable salad green without having to take a lengthy walk to a different neighborhood. I feel guilty that I can afford to have my locally grown produce delivered to my doorstep when I know that 3 out of 4 people walking down my street don't even know what fresh spinach, never mind arugula, looks like.

Instead, watch ""Forks Over Knives"" then in a generation or two when this battle has been conquered then maybe ""Ingredients'"" cluelessness of race and class will not seem so awkward.",1354924800,23,998,5.192546583850931

It was interesting to learn that the new farmers have learned that they farm the soil and not the plant to obtain a more natural, organic product with more succulent flavor than the Industrial farmers of today.  This principle also applies to our rancher who supply the meat source.
I did not realize that todays local farmers markets are allowing the heirloom variety of vegetable and fruits to be reintroduced, because you cant find them in a supermarket of today.
I could not believe that on the American Census  Farmer is not even listed on the list of Occupations. We need to support our farmers and preserve our land because eventually there will not be farm land available at this rate to supply the needed food supply.
