8433172,5,B004KNO7WA,"Great product and very good support in that you get to ask direct questions to the staff that created the video. You also get to have free legal insight from the law group that the team works with. All in all helpful, insightful, and for the most part it is up to date with the times.",1330387200,4,284,4.089285714285714
8433173,5,B004KNO7WA,I really enjoyed watching this DVD and learning more about wholesaling.  It is specifically going to help me with my confidence level in wholesaling as well as the forms to wholesale with.  I also received a personal phone call from Michael after registering on his website and I appreciate any time someone makes a point to serve their customers in such a personal way.,1325894400,6,370,4.765625
8433174,5,B004KNO7WA,"This product has zero fluff. The two pros delivering the content are in the trenches doing it and are known for their sincere passion to share what they've learned and their ability to deliver, and it shows! The DVD is a course in itself and organized to make for easy reference. Soup to nuts content on the opportunity to create wealth through successful wholesaling. One DVD jam packed with greater value that the usual 'guru' offerings. I was surprised to find that it goes beyond the DVD to further web-based info that includes an invaluable interview with a top notch real estate attorney. My library is extensive and this is among the best yet.",1315008000,5,650,4.7105263157894735
