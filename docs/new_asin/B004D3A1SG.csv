4331361,5,B004D3A1SG,"Robert Naylor as Tommy, the disturbed little boy, is a brilliant actor.  I would rate his performance along side Leonardo Dicaprio's performance in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""  Not a happy film, but it leaves you with hope.",1416009600,4,226,5.081081081081081
4331362,5,B004D3A1SG,"I enjoyed the film a lot .The way it covered both sides of the story ,leaving you feeling empathy with the boy and the staff trying to control the situation .Acting the roll of the child must have been hard ,but probably enjoyable for the young actor ,keeping your attention for the whole film .",1414972800,,295,4.381818181818182
4331363,4,B004D3A1SG,loved the movie it showed how troubled kids with troubled childhoods become when adults give up on them  and things can change if one adult doesn't. I give a four out five because I did not like the ending. I felt it left to many questions not answered. Besides that great movie.,1409270400,6,279,4.365384615384615
4331364,5,B004D3A1SG,"This film is not entertainment, it is education. it tackles a very difficult subject in a detached, non-judgemental way, and the director achieves the feel of a fly on the wall documentary, which is exactly right for the tone of the piece. A small boy called Tommy does something dreadful to a smaller boy at the beginning of the film, and the film follows Tommy (Robert Naylor), who is already known to social services, in the aftermath. Tommy's story is told through flashbacks, and through the research his newly assigned Educator (Keyworker),  Gilles (played by Claude Legault) does. The acting is superb, and the subject matter so well researached that the complexity of Tommy leaves you torn between hating him for what he did, and wanting to hug him and tell him everything is going to be ok. There are other characters, but they mostly serve as plot tools. Some of the scenes are extremely harrowing, but taken in context, you will see that they are necessary to the story. The DVD was well produced and well presented, with a reversible sleeve covering both the English and French angles of the film's Canadian provenance. It's the first time I've encountered that, as I normally purchase DVDs marketed for the European market. The English subtitles were easy to read.",1407628800,13,1277,4.8577981651376145

8424727,5,B004D3A1SG,"For anyone who has ever worked in the juvenile justice system or in the child welfare system, this a film you have to see.  The performance of the young boy in the film is so true to the angry young delinquent I knew when I began my career that it is scary.  He is so volatile, so raw, and so true to life.  Anyone who wants to work with this population needs to see this film.",1447804800,,377,3.9342105263157894
