8332398,5,B001P807P4,I really like this movie.  It's Babara Mori at her best.  Actually all of the actors play off eachother very well.  I watched it in spanish with english subtitles.  The make up was perfect when she was playing as the ugly her.  The only real way you could tell it was her was because of that voice.,1396569600,,298,4.157894736842105

8332401,4,B001P807P4,"Barbara Mori at her most beautiful in revealing, form fitting outfits, and most homely with a disguise that includes a chubby suit, contact lenses, a wig, and fake teeth.

Barbara's character is a talented architect in Chile who becomes fed up with men after catching her boyfriend in bed with another woman (Gabby Espino), and firing a gun at him.

She decides to start a new life in another city with another architectural firm disguised as a homely wife and mother of two kids. The new firm gives her the opportunity to make and use her best skills.

One of her co-workers is a womanizer who is quite full of himself, and she decides to teach him a lesson by approaching him outside of work without the disguise as a mysterious, ravishing woman from Argentina. Every date is another scheme to torment him.

Meanwhile, he is becoming great friends with his homely co-worker.

What will happen if he finds out the two women are the same person?",1294790400,,945,4.634730538922156
8332402,5,B001P807P4,"I saw this movie in San Diego and thought it was exquisite. There are two parts that are worth waiting the entire movie for. Just as you think this guy is going to rattle off some nonsense like he did when asked about his perfect date,he is asked to say something romantic. Take note fellas-you will be floored w/it's beauty. The other scene I am speaking of is when he is on the other side of the door pouring out his heart -oh my. Do you want to be in love? This guy is in love and he gets his girl. Fantastic moving movie.",1256256000,,525,4.0576923076923075
8332403,5,B001P807P4,"I saw it on HBO Latino and had to have it!  It is a feel good Romantic comedy that is in Spanish with English Subtitles.  If you liked Betty La Fea, you will like this.",1250467200,,168,3.7714285714285714
8332404,4,B001P807P4,"Who is the better choice for a marriage partner? Is it the intelligent, hard-working, unbecoming but sincere office mate who will give a sympathetic ear to a coworker? Or, is it the gorgeous, charming, sexy, mystery person who seems reluctant to commit to a relationship? Those are the 2 opposites that Barbara Mori portrays in this romantic comedy from Latin America.

Mori, an acclaimed actress of Mexican telenovelas, and Marcelo Mazzarello, an accomplished Argentinian actor, give good performances in this light-hearted story that will amuse fans of Spanish-language films. The chemistry between these two talented perfomers is equally palpable in both the ""ugly"" and ravishing personas that Mori portrays.

There is a good mix of funny, serious & poignant moments in this delightful romantic comedy set in Chile.  If you're a fan of this genre, you'll find this movie entertaining, although not original. Enjoy!",1241481600,2,917,5.354166666666667
