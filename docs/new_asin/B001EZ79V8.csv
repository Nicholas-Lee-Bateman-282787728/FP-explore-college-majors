3558657,5,B001EZ79V8,"There are already some high-quality (and quite lengthy) technical reviews for this production of Tristan und Isolde, but it's just so awesome that I have to add one more voice to the chorus. It's easily the best version on the market, and it might just stay that way forever.

This interpretation of Tristan und Isolde is completely engaging from start to finish. I've found it hard to stay awake during other recordings, but that was never an issue here. Barenboim's conducting style keeps the drama moving at a natural rate, never rushed, and it is a beautiful listening experience from start to finish. All of the orchestral textures are very clear, as are the singers' lines, maybe thanks to improvements in technology over the years, but more likely because of Barenboim's skill in the pit.

And let's not forget the visual aspects of the Gesamtkunstwerk, which were also top-notch. The singers ACTED throughout - Meier deserves special recognition for her dramatic, expressive Isolde - and the sets were aesthetically pleasing, even though the flushed-out colors made it difficult to realize that Act II was set in nighttime (a rather important detail if you're analyzing the philosophical messages behind Wagner's work). Some people prefer a traditional set, but it never bothered me.

Of course, there were a few minor flaws, but this production captures the essence of this extremely difficult music-drama better than any other version I've seen. What an awesome production, headed by Patrice Chreau, the director, Daniel Barenboim, the conductor, and, most importantly, Richard Wagner, without whom this magnificent work wouldn't exist in the first place. Truly a masterpiece to cherish...and one I will watch many more times...at least until I can afford to attend a live performance in a good seat.",1232755200,15,1810,5.170648464163823
3558658,5,B001EZ79V8,"This is an overwhelming occasion in nearly every sense, a massive triumph. That we can now have a TRISTAN to be such is no small accomplishment.

First off, the sets, costumes. It is in neo-realistic style, with big stone walls and forbidding grays, blacks and dark colors. The singers are all dressed, refugee-style, long overcoats, shifts. It's not bad, but it still looks too modern (for me) of a tale that's set in ""Legendary"" times. To be sure, this is far more human, accessible approach than the abstracted remove of the Glyndebourne production; but a more romantic setting is needed for Act 2 (my opinion) to complement the luxuriant, sensual splendor of the central love duet.  My number 1 choice for an overall concept in terms of matching mood to music is Ponnelle's, in the 1983 film from Bayreuth.  Once you've seen it, you can't forget Johanna Meier and Rene Kollo under that huge, discreetly-dotted-lighted tree, on their knees, facing each other, with a gentle breeze wafting through. Wih this visual, bathed in that sensual music, it exactly captures that lushly romantic, mystical otherworldliness the music asks for.

What makes this production work so well is the direction of Patrice Chereau. Chereau rejected directing Tristan for years, because, as he put it, it was too much like a ""radio play"" - best heard, not seen. But having accepted it, he very much creates a moving, unstatic drama where there is action and movements as a consequence of the music and words.  Everything has a specificity and purpose, and they're all done with unerring dramatic skill and taste. Best of all, Chereau gets performances out of these artists, and there's a real collaboration where the singers don't suffer in sacrifice to the directorial vision. He both abets and frees them, allows them to be natural.

Barenboim's conducting. I cannot authoritatively elaborate about speeds, and the orchestral ""interpretation"" and such, but for what it's worth, the music sounded drop-dead beautiful to me. The Scala orchestra has never sounded so texturally gorgeous, everything so pristine and brilliant, conversely sonorous when it needs to be. Best of all though, he rarely swamps the singers, and guides them through deftly.

The casting is from strength, all the way down to the secondary roles. Grochowski's Kurwenal is strong-voiced, and physically adept, and he really is a fitting catalyst for Tristan in the third act. Michelle DeYoung's Brangaene is simply outstanding, in a long line of unheralded protaganistas in the role.  She sings without any strain, in long-breathed phrases with true musianship and a shining, freely emitted tone.  Matti Salminen - here he is, 25 years after being captured in the Ponnelle/Bayreuth film, sounding much the same, barring only a few minor patches of dryness of tone. Amazing. His restrained implacability is as toweringly menacing as ever; yet the hurt and anger come through with a reserve that indicates a seething interior.  That we have Pape, the newer Marke, and Salminen, the established veteran, in this role is an unparalleled luxury.

If there is a better matched pair of lovers today than Ian Storey and Waltraud Meier, I haven't seen them yet. Vocally, physically and histrionically, they embody the lovers to the hilt. Simply put, it would be hard to watch Eaglen and Heppner after these two (sorry, but they are so naggingly uncomfortable and restricted).

Storey is a new name to me. He is a big, burly bear of a man, tall, and ruggedly handsome. His masculine bearing is the perfect counterpoint to the lithe, feminine Meier (this is the most attractive, romantic pair you'll see). The voice may divide some. It matches the 'burly"" description - a large, baritonal sound.  Typical of a lot of ""baritonal"" Heldentenor-types, it is not especially brilliant or free on top, but neither is it unduly strained.  There's a steady flutter to the tonal output, but not a wobble at all; a bit of a grain to it, not meltingly beautiful, but powerful, steady, outpouring. And what an actor. Responsive to Chereau's direction and the sagacity of his leading lady, his performance is like a tidal wave of power and emotion.  Storey completely submerges himself into Act 3, where he gives and gives of unspeakable intensity, while never tiring vocally. The camera captures his face, sweating profusely and his raw physicality swept into the drama; talk about immersion. The unflagging energy and passion is almost frightening; it is, all told, an overwhelming portrayal.

The best for last - Meier's Isolde.  The best since the previous Meier, Johanna.  When I read a decade and a half ago that Meier would be undertaking Isolde, I was extremely doubtful.  She was billed as a mezzo when I first heard her; it was in the Barenboim Verdi Requiem recording. I distinctly recall being unconvinced by Meier.  At that time, as a mezzo, she was to me unsteady in the middle, and pushed on top. Most mezzos who have sung the Verdi Requiem have fat, solid, substantial middles; Meier did not. I'm lead to believe, then, that Meier was never really a mezzo, but a true soprano. Here as Isolde, her upper middle is far freer and expressive than her lower-middle (but now that sounds better because she's not sitting on it); but her top sounds better to me now than it did years ago. The result of singing Isolde - and others - with a higher teessitura - has freed her voice into the proper category?

Let it stand that pitch and placement wise, there are a few ( and I DO mean literally, 'few') suspect notes. But, given that the percentage rate of failure and trouble that has plagued this role, Meier's assumption is a complete success - triumph, magnificent, to be more specific.

Vocally, she has all the qualifications. A smoothness of emission. The ability to contour phrases. To sing softly without it becoming constricted. An ability to sing forte with a good measure of freedom. The ability to tailor, bend, expand, straighten out the tone according to the color of the words related to the music. To sing a true legato without it being pushed, and to last all night long without developing a crab in the tonal output.  Proponents of Leider, Flagstad, Nilsson may argue plausibly that Meier is a more on the lyrical side of dramatic than is ideal; but those ladies ain't around.  And Barenboim has thoughtfully given her voice the aural cushioning it needs.

 Best of all though, her portrayal is a totality in itself. It is hard to imagine any Isolde so physically convincing, free and unfettered.  Long years of performing this role has given her a spontaneity so that every move, every line is organically woven into her interpretation. There is not a false move anywhere, not a moment where she could be said to be floundering. She is a joy to watch. A beautiful woman, she moves like a dancer. This is a singing actress in every sense of the word, neither one taking precedence nor sacrificing the other. How often does one find the ""compleat artistry""?

Every facet of isolde is realized, you get the whole gamut, the whole story.  The ultimate catharsis and resolution in Meier's extraordinary ""Mild und Leise"" is almost too much: when she intones those first lines, the sheer radiance of her singing produces something of an intoxicatingly ethereal, almost shocking sense of release. In this context to what has followed before, ""Mild und Leise"" is a stroke of genius on Wagner's part - a real delaying of gratification if ever there was one.  You realize that, excerpted in concert, it has not nearly as much of an emotional wallop than if it caps the opera in toto.

The explosion of applause toward the performers by the Scala audience is a fitting close to a momentous occasion.",1232496000,64,7741,4.8952599388379205
3558659,5,B001EZ79V8,Nothing is ever perfect but this performance is probably as close as one will ever find to perfection in an opera house.  The sum total of all those participating is so overwhelming that one easily forgets any minor quibbles.  I won't repeat what others have said but just the prelude alone tells you this is going to be something very special from Barenboim.  Surely Waltraud Meier inhabits this role in a way few others have done since it's premiere.  The Milanese audience more accoustomed to Italian fare gave it thunderous approval.  No one interested in opera should be without this -- Wagner lover or not!,1232323200,11,612,4.79047619047619
3558660,5,B001EZ79V8,"There are very few opera productions that translate well to DVD, and this is one of them.  Never mind the fact that the Italians aren't particularly known for their Wagner, or that the Tristan could have been sung by someone else with more experience in the part.  In no other DVD production of Tristan und Isolde does the Gesamtkunstwerk of Wagner's central masterpiece leap out of the screen so convincingly as it does here.  It's not just the hypnotically flowing music, or Barenboim's insightful maneuvering of the score, the histrionically inspired cast, or Chereau's production that simply defines the color and the turgidity of the work.  It is how deftly and efficiently the producer and the conductor bring all these elements together to present one of the most complete and convincing stagings of the opera in its 150-year history.

Barenboim has lived with this score for years, and his mastery of the medium clearly shows in how he adroitly manipulates the orchestra into submitting to his musical will.  Here, there is a sense of personal identification that did not quite completely describe him when he filmed his two Tristans in Bayreuth.  He connects with the score's metaphysical ideas and presents the masterpiece as a cohesive musical, philosophical, and dramatic package that never sags the way it would in the hands of a lesser conductor or drags the way it does when handed to a cretin who thinks that the only way to conduct Wagner is to make it very slow (Bernstein).  I've seen Barenboim conduct Tristan before, and it seems as if he tailors his conception of the score with a particular audience.  In Berlin, his Tristan took on the traditional German guise more akin to Furtwngler, while his New York Tristan was characterized by a more cosmopolitan, luxuriant color.  This Milan Tristan was prepared with a more Mediterranean feel for the arching, Italianate legato lines that the country's people prefer in their music.  The great Kirsten Flagstad said that the works of Wagner, like those of Shakespeare and Goethe, were things that you do not fully understand, but works of art that you can slowly grow into.  I would say that this Tristan shows Barenboim achieving one of his best interpretive views of this highly complex masterpiece.  His tempi are never definitive, but rather they reflect the mood of the present moment.  His Act 1 is a study on orchestral phrasing.  Listen to how he partners Meier's intense narrative word for word perfectly, adjusting it as necessary to complete his half of their precisely clocked collaboration.  Another highlight?  The intense, almost manic and frightening frenzy to which he stirs the orchestra when the ship reaches Cornwall's shore.  His Act 2 gives way to tenderness and lyricism that highlights the erotic, sexually tense, and nocturnal nature of the love duet.  The harrowing intensity at which he allows the leads to express their irresistible longing upon parting is simply riveting.  His Act 3 is no doubt on of the greatest achievements of Wagnerian conducting.  It is frightening how Tristan's delirium becomes a display of neurotic longing in Barenboim's very able baton.  His Liebestod?  Sublime.  No words could better describe how powerfully he caps four and a half hours of gorgeous music.

This cast does not define Wagner singing for the ages like their predecessors did before them, but what they lack in heft, power, and stamina they replace with utmost theatricality and sincerity.  Waltraud Meier is no Nilsson, Traubel, or Flagstad, but what she had above all those leading ladies is an ability to live through the character's plights.  She is Isolde.  From the angry, hurt, Medea-like woman in Act 1 to the love stricken creature in Act 2 to the transfigured, ethereal figure in the end, she embodies the role as no other soprano has before or after.  She may not be as vocally secure as she was in the 1995 Bayreuth production she and Barenboim did together, but how she has grown into the character!  It is also astonishing to listen to her and to realize that her timbre has remained so youthful after more than a decade of singing this extremely demanding role.  She is a study in the art of expression.

Ian Storey is less impressive as Tristan, but at least he looks the part and sings passably enough.  His voice shows promise if he dedicates more time to developing the stamina and the diction needed to make his phrasing more definitive.  He's no Vickers, Windgassen, or Melchior (not to my taste, but everyone seems to like him), but his voice is lovely and his presence is formidable enough for the part.

Matti Salminen was a truly fantastic King Marke.  More than a quarter century of Wagner singing has done no damage to his sturdy, indefatigable voice.  He is the sole Wagnerian in the cast and makes a strong impression in his monologue.  In fact, I would say that besides Rene Pape, he is perhaps the only Marke in the world today who has the ability to bring the gravitas needed to make these parts work.

Gerd Grochowski is exciting and upbeat as Kurwenal.  He too has one of the better voices in the cast.  Michelle DeYoung is the sole disappointment is this entire venture.  Her shrill, wobbly voice is unacceptable for the part of Brangne.  It is unfortunate how much her instrument has digressed, since her voice was once one of the finest things to touch the Mahlerian songs.  It is now a shadow of what it once was.  Regardless, her Brangne does little to dent the overall contributions of this cast and team of musicians.

To sum it all up, this is the best DVD incarnation of Tristan, and one that best captures the spirit of the work despite the absence of a traditional Wagnerian cast.",1230508800,18,5715,4.8393408856848605
3558661,5,B001EZ79V8,"I had no trouble finding this DVD on ArchivMusic, and I know that it certainly has NOT been discontinued, so do your research, Amazon!
Adding to the one excellent review would be superfluous - and I can only say that watching the audience response resounded to the Tristan Chord within my own being!
The performance is utterly gripping, heart-wrenching and true to Wagner in every sense. Patrice Chereau has proven, over and over, that he understands Wagner on the deepest level...the stark, surreal nature of his staging leaves only the music and the poetry for us to absorb. Barenboim's love of the composer is always evident - his directing is passionate, and as for the entire company:it's already been said. This must be the definitive version of this exquisite Music/Drama, so close to Wagner's true feelings of love and death...and though Schopenhauer is a bit too evident, the truth of the theme is presented on the emotional level, far beyond the intellectual.
Which is why we cry during the opera, but not while reading the philosopher.

And Waltraud Meier IS Isolde.

Buy it - you'll congratulate yourself forever.",1229731200,28,1125,4.9787234042553195
3558662,5,B001EZ79V8,"I hope the notation at Amazon that this DVD has been discontinued by the manufacturer is in error.  It would be absurd to delete it only weeks after its official release; not only absurd, it would be a travesty, because this DVD set provides a record of an extraordinary and deeply moving performance.

It must be said that the director, Patrice Chereau, offers interpretations at several moments that will seem outlandish or wrong to purists and traditionalists; this is particularly true of the bleeding head of Isolde in her final monologue.  But I would urge skeptics to watch, listen, pay attention to the text and the music, and I believe most would agree that Chereau has not ""imposed"" anything, but has drawn from the essence of Wagner's work some powerful aesthetic and theatrical effects, making this one of the most emotionally wrenching performances of the opera that I have ever seen. Arguments about the details should not distract from the obvious fact that Chereau has produced a performance that is entirely consistent within itself, and consistent with the spirit of Wagner's work (with, perhaps, a heavy dose of Schopenhauer's worldview included).

The principals are wonderful.  Gerd Grochowski plays a youthful and smitten Kurwenal, obviously deeply in love with his master and willing to die for him.  Michelle DeYoung, made to look far older than her actual years (quite the opposite of her youthful appearance in the Met production), again performs a sympathetic and nurturing Brangaene, but from a different place on the age spectrum.  Both sing very well.

Matti Salminen's Marke is brusque, forceful, almost a King Lear in his initial royal autonomy, but staggered and nearly broken as Tristan's betrayal sinks in.  Of course, his singing of the role is deeply expressive and authoritative.

Ian Storey may not be the greatest voice to perform Tristan, but his acting and his presence are so totally effective, and his singing is always very fine if not transcendent, that his is definitely one of the best performances of the role that I have seen.  The camera gives us much more of his facial expressions, always deeply involved in the moment, than would normally be seen in the theater, and we know that he is an actor constantly inside his character.

Waltraud Meier has sung Isolde many times--this is, I believe, her third performance of the role available on DVD--but this must be her definitive performance.  Again, as with Salminen and Storey, her acting is profound, her conception of Isolde empathetic and deeply moving.  Even in her most anguished moments, Meier is beautiful and affecting, and her singing, though there are a very few moments when she is a bit flat, is wonderful.

Daniel Barenboim makes the La Scala orchestra sound magnificent, and his pacing of the music and attention to the singers makes this one of the truly great performances available in recorded form.

Again, I hope it is not true that this DVD set has been withdrawn. It should be seen by every lover of this opera.",1227484800,78,3034,4.966403162055336
3558663,1,B001EZ79V8,"The singing is ok, but Waltraud Meier has no business singing Isolde. She is a good Kundry, but Isolde requires a larger voice than she possesses. The staging is ugly. Most of it looks like it's taking place in a large warehouse. The Liebestod has Isolde singing with blood running down her face. Dear designer, we know that she is dying. You don't have to open her pores to drive that home. Oh, I guess that you are being oh so deep and oh so artsy. I much prefer the simple yet beautiful staging of the Metropolitan Opera version.",1381190400,3,532,4.383838383838384
3558664,1,B001EZ79V8,"I don't have much of a problem with any of the audio on this DVD, other than that Gerd Grochowski (Kurwenal's) singing is a little stiff. But the staging is rather ugly and uninteresting, which surprised me given Chreau's reputation from the Bayreuth Ring cycle, which I love wholeheartedly. And no matter what you think of the staging and music direction and singing and acting--no matter what your opinion would have been if you had been at the live performance--you have to admit that the video direction is pretty atrocious. Sometimes picture fades in and out of black as it cuts to different frames. Just make the damn cut! Just let us see where you're cutting to! During one of Isolde's ""arias"" (a section in which she sings alone for a while), the director superimposes an image of a rippling red piece of fabric. First of all--We can't see! Let us see Waltraud Meier! (we exclaim). It's like someone's head getting in our way at the theater. You're obstructing our view! Furthermore, the red fabric is an external image--essentially a stock image. You're just not supposed to do that in performance videos or other documentary-type films, use stock imagery. There are lots of slow pans of the camera that take us away from or distract us from the thing that we want to see. Whoever was in charge in of this production (Partizia Carmine, I guess) doesn't understand that a performance video is not like a fictional film: the idea is *not* to be artistic. Rather, the idea is to give the audience as clear of a picture of what went on onstage as possible. The editing was a constant pain in my side. In shots of just the orchestra playing (which occurred during the three act preludes), the edge of the picture was in soft focus, there was a lot of annoying fading to black, the shot was often of something one doesn't want to see, and there was much annoying panning. Again: just let me see the orchestra! Enough obstruction! I had to close my eyes during these sequences to be able to hear the music.",1356652800,14,2008,4.611731843575419
3558665,1,B001EZ79V8,"Sadly, this DVD lacks the required musical underpinning to keep it afloat.  I wonder how anyone made the required voyages in the opera with such poor sound from the pit - and hence a general lack of bouyancy and direction.",1344729600,,222,4.55
3558666,5,B001EZ79V8,"Does Wagner need more? This production is one of the most simplified that one can get and yet conveys the drama of the doomed lovers.

No need for machines or pyrotechnics here: a true master who established himself as the top in the Bayreuth Ring in '76 which remains the reference.

3558668,4,B001EZ79V8,"This was a very intelligent Tristan und Isolde probably mainly due to Patrice Chereau's very human treatment of the characters. I have never been a huge fan of Waltraud Meier, but she won me over as Isolde even though I feel a few notes sounded frayed and problematic. Overall, she lives and breathes Isolde in this video. I am not as thrilled with Ian Storey, although he is okay. I suspect this role is a little too much for him, but he acts and sings okay, since there are no true Tristans around. The two leads look wonderful together, and you truly believe their passion. I believe Chereau did an amazing job with the story. Tristan und Isolde are like drugged on each other and when apart they are in withdrawal. There are some notes to that effect in the booklet. Chereau feels they did not really drink a love potion. It was just water or a placebo which they thought was their death. It simply caused them to realize their feelings. Barenboim conducts beautifully. I believe most lovers of Tristan und Isolde should get this video.

But now for the complaint. Patrizia Carmine (the tv and video director) allows the cameras to focus on the light that Isolde will extinguish over and over in Act 2. As if we want to see the stupid light for 5 seconds while Isolde is singing! We want to see Isolde's face as she is singing! At one point the red cape-like coat becomes a focus and keeps being intertwined visually with Waltraud Meier's face as she's singing. Carmine decided to juxtapose the cape Meier is wearing with Isolde for some unknown reason. Then, in Act 3 she fades to black over and over. I suppose it is to show how Tristan is fading and about to die and going into the dark, but it is too distracting. It causes us to miss Tristan's emotions. We don't care about Patrizia Carmine's ideas. We want to see what the singers are doing and what Patrice Chereau has done with the stage. What aggravates me is that this Patrizia Carmine did the same thing to the Aida dvd starring Roberto Alagna (another opening night at La Scala). In that video she focused on all kinds of inanimate objects nobody cares about and ignores the singers. Basically, she will focus on some dumb gold object of the Egyptian set of Aida and stay on that object when we want to see what is going on. What kind of opera tv director is she? Someone needs to fire her or not let her direct anymore opera videos until she learns that no one cares about her personal take on the production. She needs to direct invisibly so that we can enjoy the whole show. If she wants to create her own show of inanimate objects, she needs to go into directing her own stories where she can have actors talking and totally ignore them and aim the cameras on a desk or lamp the whole time. That's obviously what she wants to do. So she needs to get out of directing opera for video and go into directing some stupid avant garde videos for herself (because no one will watch them).",1278979200,31,2951,4.424632352941177
3558669,3,B001EZ79V8,"This DVD has many merits which are discussed in the reviews I read prior to purchase, and I am generally in accord.  However, I downgraded this performance to three stars because of two factors not noted in the other reviews, factors which seriously affected my enjoyment of the performance. The first occurred in the first act, during Isolde's narrative.  For reasons that I cannot fathom, Isolde and her handmaiden shared the stage with a crew of sailors, their presence entirely unnecessary, who were in constant movement, several of the washing themselves, taking off their shirts in the process.  The camera did nothing to exclude their presence.  This was an egregious case of upstaging, entirely gratuitous.

The second factor, far more serious, involved Isolde's final moments, the transfiguration, the musical and spiritual climax of over four hours of music drama.  As soon as she started singing, a trickle of blood strangely trickled from Isolde's hairline, increasing to a steady flow which runs down her face and soaks her clothes.(The beginning of this can be seen on the DVD cover.) What were they thinking!? Is this supposed to be an outward manifestation of a brain hemorrhage which is the cause of her death?  In itself, that makes no sense.  But surely at this moment we should not be wondering about a flow of blood; the whole point Wagner makes is the opposite of physical.  This is when we, with Tristan and Isolde, are to lifted to something altogether lovely and transcendent.  Instead, I looked at the image and felt revulsion. In disgust, I closed my eyes. This is an unforgivable desecration of one of the sublime moments in music drama.",1278806400,14,1665,4.956834532374101
3558670,2,B001EZ79V8,"I got this DVD after reading all the praises for it, and because I found myself less than satisfied by both the Mller and Ponnelle Tristans. What a big mistake that was. Patrice Chereau's production here is certainly unconventional and in the first act I find myself annoyed by the numerous sailors on stage distracting the attention from the principal singers. Then there's that bleeding Isolde which of course doesn't make much sense, but opera production has always been a love it or hate it affair, so I guess some people will end up llking this production.

But the real killer of this Tristan is Ian Storey, is he singing as Tristan or King Marke? My god, his vocals is beyond awful, can't he at the very least sound like a tenor trying to give good vocals? Unless you are a big fan of Kermit the frog's singing I suspect you will feel the same way too about his vocals. And that guy who plays Kurwenal was quite weak too, together these 2 make the third act a real chore to listen to. DeYoung was alright but nothing great, Salminen and Meier of course delivers but can't save the production from the rest of the cast.

All in all, considering that this Tristan is about 7 bucks more expensive than the other Tristans it's hard to recommend this Tristan. Does anyone know of a Tristan that's better than the Mller and Ponnelle DVDs? I'll try the Lehnhoff DVD next but it's more expensive than the rest.",1258156800,11,1409,4.5
3558671,5,B001EZ79V8,"I first saw this production in the cinema in 2008, and immediately wanted to see it again.  That not being possible, I purchased the 1995 Bayreuth production, to see Waltraud Meier in the role again.  The Tristan of Siegfried Jerusalem was another deciding factor.  But, oh, the crazy production of Heiner Muller, obfuscating and distracting the viewer from the complete experience that this opera should be.
Now, I've purchased this version, and know that I will return to it often, for here is the story and the motivations of the characters made plain.  Others have heard limitations in Ian Storey's Tristan, but the core of his performance is his acting of the role, and as such he is a perfect match to Meier's Isolde.  She is all incandesence, while he is the visionary philosopher, who provides focus for her passion. The balance in their performance is equal and profound.  For this we must acknowledge the vision of Chereau who gives us a consistent and illuminating production; all the elements of which come together to give the exhilerating, breathtaking, and above all, passionate operatic-theatrical experience that Wagner envisioned.
Don't just take our word for it; buy it and experience the wonder for yourself.",1255651200,9,1228,5.054455445544554
3558672,5,B001EZ79V8,"This DVD was my fourth Tristan in a year's period. And although the others had much to recommend them (notably Meier's Bayreuth performance)I can say unequivocally that this is performance to own if your budget only will permit just one performance.

Where to begin. Obviously Barenboim (he conducts three of my DVD's) owns this score today as Furtwaengler did in his. His approach is both magisterial and passionate. I would judge his tempos were faster than Furtwaengler's but this is really a niggling point. Meier almost trumps her early Bayreuth performance, perhaps not vocally (she touches the C's but only just); dramatically the Chereau staging and direction are preferable to Muller's who has straitjacketed his artists with a vaguely a la Kabuki manner. Visually she is a beautiful woman, but more immportant her acting skills are incomparable. As an intrument her voice is not why you want to see a Meier performance; in fact it is not extraordinary nor idyiosyncratic, but her utter involvement with the text and incorportating it with her interpretation make her the Isolde of her generation. Interestingly in the wrong role she cannot summon up her great skills to cover up her shortcommings, e.g., her Eboli from the Chatelet. She clearly does not have the skills to negotiate the agility required for the Veil Song. O don fatal is another matter altogether, but it is a different kind of music. She also came to grief in a Carmen directed by Zefirelli. I can understand her wanting to do it, but when your director has other ideas it took guts to stay with the produdction.

Ian Storey was a name new to me (he sang Otello recently in LA). The voice is not beautiful (for that go to Jerusalem/Meier)but it is virile and even better there is no wobble as he ascends the scale and increases the volume. His instincts are also musical and he has the physique du role. He reminds me of Set Swanholm (not physicaly, but vocally)whose voice (by the time I saw hims as Tristan)was vaguely ""leathery"" but he looked wonderful (unlike Melchior) and was always dramatically involved and musically nuanced.

Why did Glyndebourne in their recent taping select Robert Gambill who manages to scupper the performance whenever he is singing: ah, the politics of casting! Gambill sang the first performances and anlthough I don't remember reading any reviews at the time, the DVD was a taping of the 2007 revival. Was Gambill already inked in for these performances? Promised because there was going to be a taping? Gambill is appearing in the new Tannhauser from Arthaus. Given the difficulties of this role, I can't imagine that will sings the role with distinction. And why was the usual cut in the Act II obsserved? Surely this is retrograde in the 21st century. Stimme is very good and would probably be better heard in the house. A plus is the presence of Pape, Bo Skovhus and Katerina Karneus--the Brangane.

The presence of Matti Salminin is outstanding; the man is a vocal miracle considering how long he has been singing and the number of times he has sung this role. Rene Pape is knocking at the door, but Salminin need not worry. Isn't it wonderful that we have two great Marks!

My only complaint is the booklet that accompanies the set. Virgin should provide a magnifying glass. The copy is white on black and the font size is miniscule. There is no listing of cue points either. Apparently Virgin is aping Opus Arte and taking 3 discs when DGG can put it in two although the price is far less than OA--even if there are two bonuses.

In short a highly recommendable performance that justifies the medium; who would have thought that a performance that took place on December 7, 2007 would become available in January 2009.",1234310400,13,3736,4.811526479750778

8300055,5,B001EZ79V8,"More than most other operas, Tristan und Isolde is placed on a pillar: Either you love it or you hate it. It is long, very long, some three hours long and there is precious little action or excitement in it. Just long spells of long held notes,. So why then is this long, slow moving relentlessly drawn out piece held in such awe?
Prior to this piece most all operas started out by establishing a tonal key center at the beginning of the work and then the melodies and harmonies were developed from it. It could wander all over musically but there was a solid foundation of relationships in the music. It sounded good and all was happy and satisfied; fulfilled. In Tristan the opening chromatic motif suggests a key but does not define it. Then the melodic lines wander all over for three hours of unstable harmonies, unfulfilled resolutions and a feeling of ill at ease incompleteness. Finally they resolve in Act 3 with the death of Tristan as  he relates his vision of Isolde as she returns; the ""yearning "" is over ( the key is established). The whole of the opera is a yearning for fulfillment - love/death. (technically -  subdominant A minor and dominant B major and related keys leading to E major). The world of opera  (and all music composition) was never  the same again. Most composers after this used some of Wagner's techniques (delayed resolution and other stretched  tonal relations) i.e Dvorak, Verdi, Tchaikovsky etc.etc.
My history with Tristan goes back to my teenage years. At about 14 I bought the first LP version of Tristan out of  Germany since the war (World War II). It was in the 1940s and was a studio recording with a music faculty as cast and orchestra players but no matter it was Tristan. The story didn't make much sense to me but no matter; it was the music that counted. And I wallowed in it! Over the years since I've seen dozens of performances in America, Europe and Latin America and have a dozen or so recordings. The CDs, DVDs and blu-rays include great versions such as Kirsten Flagstad with Melchior, Birgit Nilsson with Windgassen, Birgit Nilsson with Jon Vickers, Gwyneth Jones with R. Kollo and Hildegard Behrens  with Kollo and others. Favorite Brangaenes include Christa Ludwig and Grace Hoffman; King Mark's Matti Salminen and Robert Lloyd.
The present recording is well received and a joy to listen to. To begin with, Daniel Barenboim is to me the best present day conductor of Wagner. I knew him well from his years of conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and my esteem of him has only grown over time. He has tight control over the whole proceedings and all works out beautifully. The orchestra sounds grand! (He also did a great recording in 1983 at Bayreuth with Johanna Meier). I have great respect for Patrice Chereau as an innovative director; he shook the opera world with his Electropower dam on the Rhine and the moneyed industrialists as the Gods in the Ring Cycle. However I'm not all that enthused about the rag-a-muffin sailors and servants of Cornwall, King Mark's home or Kareol in Brittany where Tristan resides. Oh well! it's the singing that counts.
And singing there is! Waltraud Meier is marvelous! She is also acting every moment she is on stage; and she is on stage most of the time. She conveys great emotion with her face as well as with her voice. And she never tires; she was in fresh voice for the ""Liebestod"" that ends the opera and she is on stage most of the three hours the opera runs. I consider one of the great Tristan performances I've witnessed.
In closing I'd like to relate a tale of a Tristan performance of long ago. It was November 1, 1958 Lyric Opera of Chicago.was doing it's first Tristan. The conductor was the legendary Artur Rodzinski (leading Wagner conductor of the day). The Isolde was Birigit Nilsson, Brangaene  was Grace Hoffman and Tristan was Karl Liebl. Rodzinski believed in a slow methodical tempo to bring out the beauty of the music, so the evening went on and on. The crowd thinned somewhat (trains to the suburbs etc.) finally - well after midnight did the ""Liebstod"". She was in she was in the same fresh, beautiful voice as she had started some four hours earlier. What a trooper!",1452988800,,4201,4.667567567567567
8300056,4,B001EZ79V8,"I liked this production and found it very moving, but feel the need to counteract the Chereau enthusiasm of many contributors. The director has a shallow understanding of this opera, and much of the stage business is either grossly inappropriate or in some cases absurdly undermines what is supposed to be going on. To give a blatant example, the Act 3 section in which Tristan sings of his love and affection for Kurvenal is accompanied by the former viciously and repeatedly pushing his friend away. A related problem is that Chereau is obsessed with constant movement and gesture, so that even in moments of great stillness and repose people rush about changing their positions as if they were in a tv drama.",1447459200,2,711,4.836065573770492
8300057,2,B001EZ79V8,"Waltraud Meier's wonderful performance was ruined by Patrizia Carmine's inane editing.  I agree completely with earlier reviews by Zach and William Birdsall on that point, and won't repeat their observations. I will never buy another DVD or Blu Ray if she is involved in any way.  The other major disaster was the major blood flow coming from Meier's head, down her face and on to her neck during the Liebestod.  It reminded me of a scene from the OR during the Mash movie.  It ruined the most sublime and emotional operatic ending ever written. Shame on you Chereau. Wagner doesn't need that sort of help.",1423872000,7,606,4.742857142857143
8300058,5,B001EZ79V8,"Wagner reduces the whole story, romance or saga to three acts that are three unified scenes.

The first act is the voyage from Ireland to Cornwall when Tristan is bringing Isolde to his uncle Knig Marke, in fact the very last moments of the voyage that it is to say the arrival in Cornwall and the delivery of Isolde to Knig Marke and the few hours before.

The second act is one love night in Cornwall between Tristan and Isolde, a night that ends badly since Knig Marke discovers them thanks to the revelation and information Tristans friend Melot had given him. Actually Melot is part of the raiding party. In the end Melot gives Tristan the fatal wound that brings in the last act.

The third and last act is in Tristans own territory that we assume is Brittany. Tristan is dying and he is waiting for Isoldes ship. She  both the ship and Isolde  is finally announced and Isolde disembarks. Tristan says her name and dies. She faints when a second ship arrives bringing Knig Marke and his men. Kurwenal fights, kills Melot and is killed. Isolde comes out of her faint and she finally dies.

Wagner thus gives us what is a pure sketch that enables him to concentrate on what is essential, and what is known as the love between Tristan and Isolde with a third character, the second man, Knig Marke, Tristans uncle. But Wagner is a lot more complex because he actually wrote the libretto himself and his style is overpowering. But each act can have its own discourse and meaning.

DER TOD BER ALLES
In the first act Isolde is overwhelmed with her abduction of sorts, her being pulled away from her mother, her family, her country. She lives with the recollection of the Morholts death who was killed by Tristan. She wants to get to some kind of resolution of this mental and moral conflict she experiences. She requests the presence of Tristan before the ship reaches the harbor. He finally accepts and we know what she is going to do because she has revealed her real intention to Brangne when she required her to serve the special preparation of her mother, the famous vin herb or death potion or Todestrank.

She is convinced it is a poison but Brangne knows better, so Brangne resists serving that drink, and yet she yields. Brangne will only reveals the real nature of the drink after both had drunk it and the effects had been certified. Isolde is shocked by the effects because she expected to even up the Morholts death by killing both herself and Tristan, and instead they are fully in love irrepressibly desiring each other physically. It is important Wagner insists on the fact that Isolde is the one who requires the philter to be served and it is all the more important because of the total ambiguity between Isoldes real intention and the actual result. She is responsible for the subsequent disaster.

In this first act the night is death that can even up, smooth and resolve the conflict in Isoldes mind between the two dimensions Tristan has for her: the killer of the Morholt and the abductor who is taking her to her married fate. The night then is death that can avenge the Morholt and liberate her from her fate. Her death has to go along with Tristans death, together, intertwined.

DIE LIEBE BER ALLES
In the second act we are confronted to a different style. The two characters are confronted in their own minds with a vision that seems to be binary, opposing night and day. But they know night is death as well as love. Hence night itself becomes ternary with the two meanings it conveys. This is contained in the second scene of this act by the use of the two German genitives to qualify the night within two minutes or less. Tristan speaks of des Todes Nacht with an ante-posed Saxon genitive and they both amplify it with their duet into Nacht der Liebe with a postponed genitive. This gives the ternary structure of des Todes Nacht der Liebe. And this perfectly oxymoronic phrase that equalizes death and love is even more vicious than we could say at first sight.

The night, which is feminine in German (die Nacht) and as such is opposed to the day which is masculine (der Tag), is thus in perfect continuity with love which is feminine in German (die Liebe) and this love is opposed to death which is masculine in German (der Tod). The formula des Todes Nacht der Liebe thus embraces the feminine night with the opposed masculine death and feminine love. Love can only be in the night and yet the night will bring death, hence love can only exist within death.

We must understand this discourse is pure romanticism. It is the very end of Goethes Second Faust in which Goethe identifies the future of the world and humanity in woman-ness or womanhood and yet uses a neuter word for that woman, i.e. das Weib. In other words for Goethe the female future of man is neutered into a sexless woman or wench or whatever. Note das Weib is the German word that produced the English word wife, a woman neutered by marriage. And we have the relation between Knig Marke and Isolde: marriage that contains no love, that in fact condemns love to be external, externalized, outsourced to use a modern word. You cant be more German than that, more romantic than that. That leads the two lovers to the belief, and conviction (with the two meanings of this word), that the male and the female in love that they are can only be unified in the feminine night that can bring together their feminine love and the masculine death of darkness. Their love condemns, convicts and sentences, them to death. Their love is a death penalty in the night.

This is the amplification of the first act of course. The death they are targeting, both of them, is no longer the death of vengeance or whatever compensation that could be considered for past crimes, and no longer the liberation of fate and guilt that Isolde was considering before, but it is the crowning moment when the two lovers can be together, negate all social obligation and limitation, reach out beyond social or moral fate and marriage that ties up all loose ends into a smooth ball of contained and extinguished love.

DIE NACHT BER ALLES
Wagner amplifies this ternary couple of terms with his style: short lines, short phrases, but extremely heavy rhyming patterns magnified by the music and the singing.

TRISTAN
Wer des Todes (1) Nacht (2) liebend (3) er-schaut,
wem sie ihr tief Geheimnis ver-traut:
des Tages Lgen (1), Ruhm (2) und Ehr' (3),
Macht (1-4) und Gewinn (2-5), so schimmernd hehr,
wie eitler Staub der Sonnen
sind sie vor dem zer-sponnen!

Note how des Todes is echoed in des Tages or how Nacht is echoed in Macht. We could also see the echo of Geheimnis in Gewinn. It is also remarkable how the three double rhymes are not only on the last syllable but on the last two syllables and in the most regular way possible in German: only the vowel and last consonant are identical and of course not the initial consonant that has to be different with the slight imperfection of the second rhyme since the vowel varies on the first word and the second word adds a consonant that is not really a consonant, /h/.

BEIDE
O sink hernieder, Nacht (1) der Liebe (2),
gib Vergessen, dass ich lebe;
nimm mich auf in deinen Schoss,
lse von der Welt mich los!

In this small duet the two lovers beg the night to realize their love and bring them oblivion to be able to live, and yet at the same time to take the speaker into her (the nights) bosom (a feminine element) to liberate the speaker of the world, hence to give them a life that is beyond the world, beyond life. Since it is a duet both Tristan and Isolde are the speaker in the first person and the night is the interlocutor in the second person. They both ask to be liberated into life after life, to be united then in that life after life.

DIE MACHT BER ALLES
But we have to go slightly further when Knig Marke arrives and with the third act where we have the same structure or similar structure as in the second act. In the second act when Knig Marke arrives Tristan has to go away and he is fatally wounded by his own friend who considers that this love is treason. In the third act when Knig Marke arrives Tristan is already gone and dead, Melot and Kurwenal lie dead on the ground and Isolde goes and dies away.

We are thus confronted to another ternary structure: Tristan  Isolde  Knig Marke, one woman between two men. In the first confrontation the king stays and the other man goes, in fact fatally wounded. In the second confrontation the Tristan is already dead and the woman passes away into death too and the king remains alone. The king is the great cleanser. His arriving on the stage eliminates the protagonists, one by one, in a cruel progression under very clear condemnation and rejection.

We also have to see that the love that is at stake here is a love caused by some love drink, a potion, a philter, hence the powerful Viagra of the time. This love is nothing but desire, an unquenchable and uncontrollable desire. It is hormonal and nothing else. It has to be in the night, clandestine, hidden, invisible. It has to do with carnal love, nudity and so on, in one word, what must not be seen or shown. It is cursed love on the side of Tristan and in the same way we have cursed marriage on the side of the king, hormonal love versus formal marriage, night versus day, darkness versus sunlight. This is cosmic, primal, primeval. Cosmic with the reference to day and night. Night IS love, night IS death, hence love IN death. In the same way marriage IS survival, marriage IS suffering, marriage IN slavery (or enslavement).

DIE MUTTER BER ALLES
And thats where the cosmic meets the primeval. Tristan is an orphan and has never had a mother since she died just after giving birth. In a similar way Isolde does not have a mother any more since she was abducted from her and this mother gave the poison that gave them their cursed hormonal love.

For Tristan though this love in the night is a way to reach beyond his birth, to go back to his mother, inside his mother, to find life before life. This is absolutely regressive since he does not love Isolde after all but he reaches to his mother, whose love he has never known, to grasp the love he needs, and this time, with this regressive dimension, Tristan finally leaves the hormonal level of love to maybe reinvent and rediscover, though it might be his very first discovery of it, love for and from a mother. This vision is sublime because Tristan was raised by men only and his adoptive father was unmarried and when he married Tristan stole his wife who should have been his adoptive step mother and made her his sexual lover. True enough though, it is Isolde who, trying to escape her fate of becoming a wife (the young  fourteen years old  wife of an old  over thirty-five years old at least  king), plunged herself and her future adoptive stepson into the bleakest witchs brew, and that time it was not only a philter but a destructive machine.

When we reach this level we find out Wagner is Freudian to the extreme, though Sigmund Freud had not started publishing what will make him famous yet. Wagner is modern and he gives such a psychological depth to this story that it became prophetic beyond being simply mythical as some  like Philippe Walter, Daniel Lacroix and Corina Stanesco, to keep to French universities dons  would like us to believe. As such it becomes the continuation of Goethes two Faust plays and the exploration of the inverted story: what if it were the woman who had the devilish power of casting love onto the man, Gretchen seen as a witch and Faust becoming the victim of a lubricious woman. The future of man in such a woman is  and the opera is there to prove it  particularly tragic, and I mean tragic in the deepest Ancient Greek meaning. In fact it makes me think of Jean Racines Brnice in which the Jewish Brnice and the Roman Titus come to parting with this marvelous psychological elaboration that could be a duet: I love you so I depart. You love me so I depart, we love each other so we depart. Just push the word depart from leave to die and Tristan and Isolde definitely are the tragic fate of the departed.

DAS GESCHLECHT UND DAS ALTER BER ALLES
This particular production is admirable in many ways but has essentially one short coming. The setting and the costumes, hence the stage directing by Patrice Chreau is perfect;. He chose modern costumes and yet quite out of any standard with long coats (like in westerns), a total lack of color except for a red coat, a red dress and a blue dress for Isolde. Night time, no light, darkness and all dressed in grayish, brownish or kaki clothes. We couldn't agree more.

The music is perfect in its execution and rendering. Just soft enough and just not too pompous as so many think Wagner always is. The music is romantic, enticing, mesmerizing and the rare moments of power are absolutely justified though the whole opera is swimming, floating or even flying in ethereal and surreal music and a supernatural atmosphere. Daniel Barenbom has perfectly captured this soft grandeur or grandiose softness of Wagners music in this opera. His conducting is sweet and velvety without becoming sugary and disheartening. We adhere completely to the fate of the lovers though they are nothing but lascivious, Viagra overfed, hormone obsessed, sex driven love makers. This dimension is rendered both by the music and the stage direction in undertones of contained innuendo. Do not expect any flesh on this stage.

The only shortcoming has to do with the physique and the age of the main singers. Knig Marke is perfect and we do understand that a fourteen year old virginal girl would not accept to sacrifice her cherry for such a caricature of a lovable man. But both Tristan and Isolde are not the proper age, whats more Tristan is not the proper healthy fit body he should be since he is a heroic knight and he should inspire immediate and total physical attraction and desire, and whats more he should be fifteen year old. He is at the very least three times as much. I will not speak of Isoldes age because it is supposed not to be proper to do so. Today in the opera world we want some congruence between the actors, or singers, and their characters. Luckily the opera was not by Handel, otherwise Tristan would have been a castrato and we would properly have had a female soprano under his name.
