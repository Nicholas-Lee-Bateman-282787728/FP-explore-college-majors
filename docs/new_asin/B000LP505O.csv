They really don't make movies like this anymore, even the so-called ""heart-wrenching"" movies of today do not have the ability to stir the great emotions of sympathy like this one. I couldn't help but cry buckets towards the ending of the show. I had to contain my overwhelming emotions as the mother finally ended her life in the symbolic river which flows east. The river symbolizes many things in this movie, as in accordance with the title, a river that flows east reminds one of home, hope, and a battle against the invading forces of the Japanese. It represents hope for Bai Yang (a great actress), the home for Tao Jin, as he thinks fondly of his home before he is slowly seduced by the riches and decadence of Shanghai.

I first read the abridged version of the book when I was about 15 or 14, and it made a great impression on my mind, it was one of the very few Chinese classics that I read and unlike other classics, it moved me to the core. Strangely, I still remembered it at this age, and when I discovered the tape, I just had to watch it. The book is equally moving, do read it if you have a chance.",1523664000,,1156,4.302752293577981
8162823,4,B000LP505O,"After the war, Chinese filmmakers wasted no time in telling tales of Japanese oppression, the fight to liberate China and its realities of the aftermath of war, and it wasn't all parades and celebrations.

After ""Eight War Torn Years,"" it was clear that the upper class Chinese were guilty of overindulgence while citizens in the countryside fought the dirty fight. Nowhere is it more clearer in this Chinese masterpiece which runs over three hours long, but tells a sprawling tale of one man Zhang Zhongliang whose heroism working for the army medical corps was questionable to say the least.

Forced to flee to the city of Chongqing, his family is left doing all the hard work.  Finding himself unemployed, he hooks up with a rich ex-girlfriend and ends up marrying her, living in the lap of luxury and questioning just what it was he had been fighting for.

Meanwhile his wife Sufen, played by the wonderful veteran actress Bai Yang, is left to take care of their son on their own, believing her husband to be dead. Her final plea to her son to be like his uncle, not his father, is heartfelt and poignant. Like most Chinese women that preceded her, she represents China herself, betrayed but determined to fight on.

The quality of this film is much better than previous Cinema Epoch releases in their Chinese film series. This film has survived better and is likely hailed as a classic. There are many films made during this era centering on the disillusioned war veterans and their inability to find their way back into a peaceful society, but this film did it the best.",1205712000,5,1576,4.716363636363637
