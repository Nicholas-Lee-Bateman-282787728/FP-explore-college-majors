My 2.5 year old is 26 lbs, and I'm not really sure if the exercises where they are sitting on your back are especially healthy for your back.  Additionally, unless your toddler is hella coordinated (which I don't know any that are) they are going to fall off your back, which is not really conducive to a good workout.

If you're looking for a workout with moves that both you and your child can do together this is not the one.",1417132800,8,697,4.2180451127819545
