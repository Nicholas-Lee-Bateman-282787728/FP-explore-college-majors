4312894,4,B004B3254Q,"My first exposure to Romain Duris was his performance in the superb ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped.""  By comparison, ""Heartbreaker"", is a light, improbable, and formulaic romantic comedy.  And it's flawed.  Still, I loved it.  Duris is really developing his comedic and dancing chops, and there are some very funny moments in this film.  Vannesa Paradis seems somewhat stiff and monochromatic, (as though her husband, Johnny Depp, was on the set with a gun trained on Duris to make sure things didn't get out of hand) and plays an ice queen, but she is beautiful, as are the locations (The French Rivera).  It's a silly RomCom for viewers with a measurable IQ.",1301356800,,661,4.8053097345132745
4312895,5,B004B3254Q,"I'm a big fan of Romain Duris' work.  We'll take a chance on movies simply because he's in it.  That trust paid off in spades in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beat-That-My-Heart-Skipped/dp/B000B9EYFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beat That My Heart Skipped</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paris/dp/B002VKB0M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paris</a>, two outstanding movies.  The good news is the Duris' presence turns 'Heartbreaker' into a winner as well.

In this film, Duris is back to the unconventional romantic lead he so winningly played in L'Auberge Espagnole and its little seen follow-up,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-Dolls/dp/B000GBEWP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russian Dolls</a>.  His on-screen chemistry with unique beauty Vanessa Paradis (better known on these shores as Johnny Depp's long-time girlfriend) is palpable.

Heartbreaker's writers (four are credited) have penned a neat concept: Duris is part of three-person team hired to break up couples, specializing in the ones that are ""unhappy but don't realize it.""  Thing is, the couple's friends and family do realize it.  They're the ones funding the contracts.

Duris's business might be called a 'family enterprise': his cohorts are his sister Mlanie and her husband Marc, played respectively by Julie Ferrier and Franois Damiens.  Both are excellent, especially Ferrier, showing up in a number of guises in the Monaco hotel - maid, waitress, guide, customer service representative (where she lays down some excellent Mandarin).

The beginning of the movie is outstanding: director Pascal Chaumeil has staged one of the trio's operations in North Africa.  We can only guess early on as to what Duris and the others are up to as he works to ensnare his mark.  After that successful operation, Chaumeil stages an excellent pastiche of four more operations, where we see Duris' character using the same lines, faking the same tears, wrapping up another successful breakup.

You have those successes in mind when you're watching the hilarious bit shown during the closing credits.  There, we see Marc trying his hand at the same role and lines that his brother-in-law had perfected.  The results are priceless - Damiens oafishly overplaying Duris' lines and Ferrier underplaying her reaction to his broad failure.  They're a great comedic duo.",1301184000,,2470,6.260355029585799
4312896,5,B004B3254Q,"This is what a romantic comedy can be. Wonderful chemistry, intelligent script, beautifully directed.
The unexpected within the expected. Absolutely worth owning, sharing, and watching again, and again
to lift yourself out of one of those days. It's a perfect example of the French style lifting way above the
 usual Hollywood fare. A great gift for movie lovers film libraries. Vanessa Paradis and Romain Duris,
and the supporting cast, are all special in their own right and combine for the perfect ""je ne sais q'uois""
we all look for in films, especially the light ones. So good I ordered the other DVD's available from
the director but they just came so haven't had time to watch yet. If you haven't seen Paradis in
The Girl On The Bridge order that at the same time, you'll want more of her and it's a real classic.",1300233600,,820,4.694444444444445
4312897,4,B004B3254Q,"There have been a lot of romantic comedies about prostitutes and gigolos, but ""Heartbreaker"" (L'arnacoeur) puts a new twist on the lover-for-hire theme. Alex (Romain Duris) specializes in breaking up relationships. With the aid of his sister Mlanie (Julie Ferrier) and brother-in-law Marc (Franois Damiers), Alex saves women from unhappy relationships by seducing the ladies away from their beaus. He's a pro. And he owes people money. So, when a rich flower magnate hires him to break up his daughter Juliette's (Vanessa Paradis) engagement to a very nice, affluent British man (Andrew Lincoln), Alex accepts. But this case presents some problems: The couple are genuinely happy and well-suited. And Alex is smitten with Juliette.

Most of the movie takes place in Monte Carlo, where the bride is planning her wedding and Alex is attempting to be a convincing bodyguard. Since Juliette is being manipulated, she is the straight man. Her dilemma seems real. Many of the laugh-out-loud moments are thanks to the antics of Mlanie and Marc. Their little team is much too high-tech for such a ramshackle operation, but that's the kind of suspension of disbelief that comedies can get away with. I think there should be a rule that romantic comedies not run longer than 90 minutes, and this one runs 105, but it's fun and makes good use of the new twist on an old theme. The only bonus features on the DVD (MPI 2011) are a trailer (2  min) and a TV spot (30 sec). Subtitles are available in English SDH, English, and Spanish.",1297641600,8,1520,4.887596899224806
4312898,4,B004B3254Q,"You and your team are technologically sophisticated enough to be bank robbers, or the support crew for James Bond.  Instead, you are in the ""break-up"" business... people pay you to get their sisters, mothers, daughters, and friends to break off their relationships with men who don't deserve them.  Alex (Romain Duris) is a kind of hired gigolo, except part of his operational style is that he will get into their heads, not between their legs.  He gets women to break off relationships, with the highlight being that the women also walk away from him, with a smile.

When Alex is asked to get Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) to break off her engagement to a seemingly really nice guy, he is torn.  Except the mob is after him for an unpaid debt, so Alex takes the job.

It's a romantic comedy.  Guess how it ends.  Even with this predictability, there are many fabulous funny and touching scenes.  His business partners are his sister and her husband, and they are great as his support crew on his ""missions.""  In fact, overall the supporting cast is very strong; that's a real plus for any movie.

Ironically, even though the movie is in French with English subtitles, many of the superb songs are played in their original English.

All around, this was just an up-beat, positive movie.  Invite your date to see it, but make sure you look over your shoulder for Alex, just in case.",1296172800,,1378,4.668049792531121
4312899,4,B004B3254Q,"Alex Lippi (Romain Duris) has an odd occupation.  He gets paid to break up relationships.  Assisted by his sister Melanie (Julie Ferrier) and her husband Marc (Francois Damiens).  Together, they construct elaborate schemes aimed toward getting the women to recognize their own doubts about their relationships.

The team employ an intricate strategy, gathering extensive intelligence on their targets before they put their plans into action.  There are also rules.  The team will not break up a happy couple.  This presents a problem when Alex agrees to take up a challenge named Juliette (Vanessa Paradis).  Heavily in debt and faced with a moral dilemma, Alex complicates matters by falling in love with his target.

The film had great dialogue and well developed characters.  The comedy was subtle, but fresh.  While the plot was predictable, I enjoyed watching it develop.  The ridiculous schemes that this team hatches makes for some interesting interactions and sets the foundation for some great situational comedy.  It is a light, fun and unique story.

While it is predictable at times, the situations offer some unique opportunities for fresh humor.  Strong dialogue, good character development and a skilled cast give life to an excellent screenplay.",1296000000,6,1261,5.32994923857868
4312900,3,B004B3254Q,The story line attracted me to this movie which was good.  I was especially happy to have it in French with subtitles as my daughter-in-law loves all things French and is fluent.  Story was predictable which I don't mind but I prefer more toward G than even pG-13.  Not an R thank goodness.  Will watch again but it won't be a favortie/classic in my DVD collection.,1295568000,,365,4.484848484848484
4312901,4,B004B3254Q,"HEARTBREAKER ('L'ARNACOEUR')  is a delightful bit of French fluff, created as only the French know how. There are 'quotes' from certain films and songs that mix the two main characters together and  add to the meringue of the farce. Based on a light story by Laurent Zeitoun, Jeremy Doner, and Yhan Gromb and directed with a fine sense of comic timing by Pascal Chaumeil, this is one of those examples of the farces the French do so well.

Alex Lipp (Romain Duris), his sister M&eacute;lanie (Julie Ferrier) and her husband Marc (Franois Damiens) run a little business: they coordinate efforts to breakup undesired relationships for pay. After a few examples of how the trio works its magic, an assignment takes them to Monaco where they are hired to stop the marriage between Juliette Van Der Becq (Vanessa Paradis) and her wealthy humanitarian fianc&eacute; Jonathan Alcott (Andrew Lincoln) - in 10 days time! Alex is avoiding previous client debts represented by a bodyguard Goran (Jean-Marie Paris) but plunges into the formula courtship destruction mode with Juliette; the difference this time is that Juliette seems happily ensconced in the marriage plans and has little time for Alex's plans. But of course through the period of time allotted, Juliette finds qualities in Alex that are missing from her 'perfect' fianc&eacute; and Alex breaks his cardinal rule and falls in love with his marked client Juliette. The manner in which the story is resolved is clever and entertaining and heartwarming.

This may not be a great movie but it is a well-acted refreshing little romp to cleanse the palette! In French and English with subtitles. Grady Harp, November 10",1289865600,20,1668,5.054545454545455

My favorite thing about the DVD release is the audio quality because everytime when a rock and roll song or rap song would come on, it would sound like a radio is on with really lound speakers that are turned all the way up! My two favorite songs throughout the whole the film is America by K'naan and The Joker by The Steve Miller Band!

The whole point of the film is this guy Alex Lippi (Romain Duris) who breaks up bad relationships. So, he finds this couple (Vanessa Paradis, Andrew Lincoln) that are about to get married 10 days and he turns out to be the bodyguard for Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) and they start to like each other before Alex breaks them up!

This is a really good movie I mean REALLY, REALLY good movie for everyone but it's not rated when it should be rated PG-13 for langauge but the langauge is in the subtitles but the langauge is not strong!

Though it doesn't challenge our minds very much, it easily keeps us entertained and engaged for the entire hour and 40 minutes, while making us laugh all along the way.  Most of the movie takes place in Monaco, and it doesn't fail to deliver beautiful images of the scenery throughout the film.  The entire movie is filled with bright images of some of the most beautiful places in the world.  Even the hotel rooms the characters stay in are beautiful.  Unfortunately, all of this scenic beauty seems to be a cover-up for some of the lack of emotion in this movie.  (SPOILER ALERT) Like any romantic comedy, this is your standard, cheesy ending where the guy admits his flaws and gets the girl and all his happy in the world.
 One thing that I thought to be very French about this movie was that they included a lot of American music and culture.  While in American movies, you rarely hear music that is from other cultures or in different languages, I feel that it is a very French thing to do by including music and movies from other cultures such as ours.  Another thing about this movie that struck me as very French was the importance of fashion.  The main character, Alex, runs into a bunch of financial trouble, as revealed by his business partner, because he spends all of their money on expensive suits.
 This film was directed by Pascal Chaumeil.  This was his first feature length film that he directed.  However, he did have experience with numerous other TV movies and TV series.  He was also the first assistant director for ""The Professional"", which was directed and written by popular French director, Luc Besson.
 The main idea of this movie was the search for happiness.  Alex's job is to help people find happiness.  He is hired by the friends and family of people who are in unhappy relationships, whether they know it or not.  Alex also says that he only works to break up couples that he knows are unhappy.  Another idea of this film is that love can be found in unexpected places.  At the beginning of the movie, Alex never thought he would fall for a client.  However, as I'm sure you could've guessed, by the end he is madly in love with Juliette and lays everything on the line for her.",1354924800,,2284,4.5763546798029555
4312960,4,B004B3254Q,"The Heartbreaker is a lighthearted, likeable romantic comedy that will keep you interested and laughing from the beginning to end. Although comparable plots to a few American movies such as ""Hitch"" and ""Failure to Launch,"" The Heartbreaker delivers a quirky storyline.

Alex Lipp (Romain Duris), his sister Mlanie (Julie Ferrier) and her husband Marc (Franois Damiens) run a business of sorts that breaks up couples that are unhappy. His current mission involves Juliette (Vanessa Paradis), who at first seems unlikeable. She is wealthy and has an expensive lifestyle, which may contribute to her seeming stuck up. However, as the story progresses we get to see her playfulness and how Alex makes her more of a free spirit. Lipp plays his role flawlessly, using his seduction and good looks to woo women and make them realize they deserve more. He gives a superb performance, and he and Paradis have great on screen chemistry as well. They are very believable and not awkward as I have seen in other romantic comedies. The supporting cast is also brilliant, and Ferrier and Damiens personalities add to the laughter and smiles. The entire cast is able to adapt to their characters very smoothly, and it adds to the cohesion of the entire movie.

The movie was set in Monaco, and I loved the location and scenery of the movie. The director allows you to experience a great deal of Monaco's sights and allows you to be temporarily transported there. This was French director Pascal Chaumeil's debut feature film, although he has recently directed various TV shows. Before this, he worked in advertising. The Heartbreaker was nomination for multiple Cesar awards and a Satellite award.

One idea I liked in the movie, was the theme of happiness. Alex had strict morals in his job, and only broke up couples where the woman was unhappy. If they were clearly both into the relationship, he stood his distance and didn't cause any conflicts. Alex wooed the woman into gaining a new sense of appreciation so they could leave their current partner and find happiness. This added to the feel-good theme of the movie. Another idea was the theme of finding love where you least expect it. Alex had seduced various women before without falling for them, so why did he fall for Juliette? This shows that love can be found in unexpected places, and even when you're not looking for it it may present itself to you.

However, one negative to this movie is the clichs. Although at first I thought the movie would avoid clichs, it has the same storyline of `good girl falls for bad boy'. At the end of the movie, Juliette leaves her fianc for Alex. Her fianc is also a clich of the perfect man: rich, handsome, romantic and loving. He has no flaws, yet she ends up running away the day of their wedding. Then there was the end scene of the bride in her wedding dress running down the street jumping into the arms of the man she now loves.  It's not the kind of film in which you wait for a twist in the end, you know what's going to happen, which I found to be an undesirable aspect.

I found a few things French about this movie. One was the integration of other cultures into the French movie. All the music was in English and some conversation in English too. There was incorporation of the film ""Dirty Dancing"" and also the pop song ""wake me up before you go-go"". In American movies they stick to American features, so I found this American influence in French movie interesting. Another French aspect was the protective families. Juliette's dad hired Alex because she didn't feel her fianc was right for her. Instead of just talking to her directly, he took strict matters of paying someone $50,000. This shows the lengths he was willing to go to to have power over her decisions.

All in all I enjoyed The Heartbreaker, though at sometimes I felt it was repetitive. I appreciated the American influence on the French movie, and enjoyed the dialogue, characters, and scenery of the movie. I would recommend it for an easy, feel good movie.",1354924800,,4027,4.7116477272727275
4312961,2,B004B3254Q,"I won't summarize the movie, since so many others have done it and done a good job, at that. I will only give you my opinion of the movie.

I have to say this is the worst French movie I have seen in a LONG time. We bought this for a Valentine's Day movie night with my local Alliance Franaise, and I was actually impatient for it to end! I usually love French cinema because of its simple but strong and compelling storylines, understated but realistic acting, and great cinematography.  This movie had none of this.

I understand that romantic comedies are supposed to be cheesy, but this one was definitely in the lower end of the category! The storyline was boring, unbelievable and totally predictable. There is also a glaring lack of chemistry between the two protagonists. I had to wonder what exactly he found in her- Paradis's character is bland, we never really discover what makes her tick, and Paradis's performance itself is pretty unconvincing (can't blame her- the script gave her nothing to work with!). For a worldly man such as Duris's character to supposedly fall in love with her requires a major suspension of disbelief! And I wondered too what attracted her in Duris... He was definitely not at his best, charm-wise!

The setting (Monte Carlo) was glamorous, and there were a couple of nice shots, but really nothing new or breathtaking. There, too, a disappointment.

This movie was more in the Hollywood genre than French cinema. For those who like French cinema for what it offers that's different from American movies, don't bother...",1349740800,,1560,4.8059701492537314
4312962,5,B004B3254Q,"If one could give 10 stars, I would give ""Heartbreaker"" 10.  This is one of the funniest and most wonderful movies of all time.
Romain Duris is excellent, as is the female lead.  The story line alone is hilarious, and these two pull it off very well.
This is absolutly a MUST SEE (french w. english subtitles)",1347926400,,309,4.4035087719298245

Vanessa Paradis's family think that her English fiance is not right for her.  Oh, he's rich and not bad looking.  It's just that he's also very boring.

If you've ever seen Frank Capra's It Happened One Night starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, you know how this film ends. This film mostly takes place in beautiful Monaco rather than in rundown trailer camps.

Still, I recommend this film as being funny.",1346371200,,630,4.777777777777778
4312964,3,B004B3254Q,"There are some things to like in this film.  Vanessa Paradis, as the leading lady, is lovely, Julie Ferrier and Francois Damien as the married side-kicks are both terrific, and Monte Carlo is....well Monte Carlo. But most of the characters are types and the script is predictable....we know from the get-go what will happen.  (The final scene was a rip-off of the final scene in ""The Graduate."")

The main problem I had with the film, other than the so-so plot, was the lead actor, Romain Duris.  I saw him recently in a wonderful film about Romanian Gypsies and loved him in it.  Here....and this is just my personal opinion, which is evidently not shared by any of the other commenters, I just hated him!  I love many not-pretty French actors, Yvan Atal, for one, who made a terrific co-star with Vanessa Paradis, in ""The Girl on the Bridge. But Duris, here, pushed the limits of my aesthetic tolerance too far. I just found him personally repulsive ...sorry!  And frankly this ruined the film for me.  One has to like the hero to root for him and I kept hoping that Vanessa would end with the nice Oxford graduate.

Again, Julie Ferrier and especially Francois Damien bring a lot of freshness and humor to the film.  The fellow who plays Paradis' father is very good, too.  Too bad Duris is on screen for most of the film. If you like a lightweight film with a predictable plot in a lush setting, you may like this.",1344038400,,1418,4.543307086614173
4312965,1,B004B3254Q,"As in, watching it evokes what one imagines would be the feeling of being hit over the head with a bulldozer.  The premis is a good one, and the movie begins interestingly, but then, the film becomes something else -- what I do not know.  The character of Juliette could not be more flat, apparently having been run over by the aforementioned bulldozer.  The character of Sophie exceeds the bulldozer and is more akin to a tank.  As to Vanessa Paradis.  This is now considered ""beautiful?""  But she's the one awarded the 'Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres', not moi, so, so much for my opinion.  Now, Melanie Ferrier -- she is a true beauty, and a wonderful actress.

The performance of all the other actors, and, indeed, their story within the story, is what interested me.  I would like to see the story of the brother and sister, and the hero be the story in this movie.  Come to think of it, how is it that that story was so rich, and all else was flat?

And what's with the music score?  Also a bulldozer.  I've never seen a movie that had subtitles for ALL the songs with lyrics, either.  Note:  the music does not help make this bad movie better.

One more thing - Vanessa's gap-tooth look is not appealing, and it is just rude that with all her money, she does not get her teeth capped, when millions of people who would do anything to have a good smile and cannot afford it.  It's not sexy, and her teeth look unhealthy anyway.  so there.",1329523200,2,1458,4.356877323420075

4312967,4,B004B3254Q,"""Heartbreaker"" (original title ""L'arnacoeuris"") is a well-made French romantic comedy starring Roman Duris as Alex, a professional ""heartbreaker,"" who is hired to break up the relationship between Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) and her boyfriend Jonathan (Andrew Lincoln). Alex, who needs money now, approaches to Juliette as her bodyguard and, assisted by his sister Mlanie (Julie Ferrier) and her husband Marc (Franois Damiens), he attempts to sabotage the upcoming wedding of Juliette by making her fall in love with him.

But of course things turn out differently for Alex when he himself falls in love her. Why not? It's Vanessa Paradis, after all!

You should not take the film's contrived premise too seriously. For all charming and suave Roman Duris and his nice comic acting, Alex's ""profession"" (with a long successful track record suggested in the opening) is not very convincing. The storyline is predictable, and honestly, what kind of people would really trust and hire ""a professional heartbreaker""?

For all its implausible plotline, the romantic comedy benefits from the performances from the capable leads and supports, and ""Heartbreaker"" remains an enjoyable ride throughout. Duris and Paradis have enough chemistry to carry the entire film as two likable characters with different social backgrounds. Also, the film's reference to ""Dirty Dancing"" is effective, with a brief but fine dancing scene of the leads.

""Heartbreaker"" is an engaging romance told with humor. Beautiful on-location cinematography in Monte Carlo is another plus.",1320537600,,1551,5.531645569620253

The Heartbreaker team is comprised of master seducer Alex, his sister, and her husband; and together, the quirky trio spies on their subject, finds the flaws in the relationship, and develops an elaborate sabotage plan.

This time the assignment is Juliette, the confident daughter of an overprotective French millionaire. Juliette, played by Vanessa Paradis (Mrs. Johnny Deep), is about to marry a rich, kind, and handsome Brit; and the Heartbreakers have only a few days to convince the strong-willed Juliette to break the engagement.

Filmed against the backdrop of the French Riviera, the cinematography is a delicious treat, but the ingenious script and the spirited performances are the two winning elements of the movie.

The script is a smart hybrid between a romantic comedy and a light spy thriller, and it will have you laughing out loud from beginning to end. And while the finale is somewhat predictable, the twists in the plot will have you wondering how it's all going to unravel.

As far as performances, the suave Duris is superb as he charms the ladies, and he and Paradis show a decent amount of chemistry on screen. The supporting cast is also brilliant, especially Julie Ferrier (who plays Alex's sister) and Franois Damiens (Alex's brother-in-law).

Don't wait for the American remake; watch this original version, because--like its hero--is stylish, clever, and simply hard-to-resist!

4312971,4,B004B3254Q,"Let me state upfront that I am a pretty big fan of Vanessa Parais, the French singer/actress (and partner of Johnny Dep, incidentally). So when I saw this movie recently at my local library, I just had to pick it up.

""Heartbreaker"" (105 min.) brings the story of Alex (played by Romain Duris), whose job it is to break up couples where the woman is clearly unhappy by seducing the woman in the relationship. Alex gets hired by the dad of Juliette (played by Vanessa Paradis) to try and break up the woman's relationship and pending marriage. Alex poses as a newly-hired bodyguard of Juliette, but then apparently seems to break the cardinal rule: as the movie progresses he actually falls in love (or does he?) with Juliette, who seems perfectly happy with her upcoming wedding. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

This movie was a massive hit in Europe last year. While there is nothing earth-shattering about this movie, time flew by as I watched this. The main actors ooze charm, and it's always a pleasure to see Vanessa Paradis. In all, I would recommend this if you are in the mood for a light-hearted French rom-com.",1302739200,3,1148,4.622549019607843

In this case he does it for women that are clearly unhappy in relationships and just need a brief fling to smack them out of being with a jerk guy. He doesn't sleep with them but generally some passionate kissing is all that is necessary to make them leave their loser - the intent of whomever paid for that to happen (concerned father / brother etc.).  Alex finally sets his sights on a challenge. A woman who seems to not be unhappy.  But Alex is in some debt and needs the money so he gives it his best shot. And of course, falls in love.  The story writes itself.  It is all about the execution. The problem I guess for me is that I am not french. So a lot of things were troublesome. First, Alex, to me, in looks, is the personification of untrustworthy french guy. He looks like a complete scammer. Not just a regular guy. His cover is bodyguard but he has facial hair and most body guards are former military and wouldn't have that.  He also tries to woo his intended by being a bit of a geek... but he is way too much of a geek and I think it would have turned me off. It was hard for me to buy the woman falling in love with him in 10 days and, even if she did, most of that time he was lying to her about who he was...so... does she know him at all?
