2334170,3,B0009X7BHI,"Although Robert Altman is proficient in re-creating the scenery of Van Gogh's life through the eyes of the painter with striking color and a vaguely bohemian atmosphere, he still fails to present Van Gogh the man or the artist in with any genuine originality. He focuses on Van Gogh, the tormented saint-artist, who forges ahead on the canvas with a drive to present the ""suffering"" of humanity. However, Altman precludes Van Gogh's obvious manias, his periods of demented elation. It is impossible to believe that the Van Gogh presented here could have produced those vibrant wheat fields in Arles, or the Night Caf. What remains in this fractured (though never incompetent biopic), is Tim Roth's virtuoso performance; he managed to literally crawl into the skin of Van Gogh, and the result may frighten you. However, his virtuosity always overshadows Paul Rhys' rather tepid presentation of his brother Theo, though there are other admirable performances in the film, such as Wladimir Yordanoff's amiable presentation of Gauguin. Altman seems to be commenting, rather uninterestingly, about the commercial dimension of artistry, and of the impossibility of true recognition of genius. This is a conventional portrait of the unrecognized genius, it is a tale told again and again. However, Altman's imagery is captivating (with the help of Storraro), the photography looks like vibrant haloes emitted by Van Gogh's paintings, though the musical score is dreadful and morbid. Still you much watch this one for Tim Roth's inspired performance if nothing else.",1165449600,8,1558,5.3117408906882595

Vincent van Gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy. The artist who portrays him does his job very well.

The scenery is breathtaking.

However the nudity  in the film is vulgar. The chaeracters are hard to identify with. Some of the scenes are disgusting.

Not going to see this one again.",1149120000,3,329,4.701754385964913
2334172,4,B0009X7BHI,"I will admit I am a huge fan of Altman, but I love this film on its own.  Visually it is stunning: the photograhy and lighting are a wonder.  The film itself is like a canvas for some beautiful art.  The perfomances are excellent - watching the love and great conflict between the brothers is riveting.  This is one of Altman's unsung gems.

2334173,4,B0009X7BHI,"Robert Altman directed this interesting film biography of Vincent Van Gigh and his art dealer brother Theo, who felt terribly guilty because he couldn't sell any of his brother's paintings in his Paris art gallery. Altman's theme is about commercialism vs. artistic genius, and how tormented these two brothers are. It's beautifully photographed, but the movie feels long at 138 minutes and for some reason the conversations are whispered throughout the movie and are often inaudible.

Altman doesn't focus his story strongly enough: Theo is as tormented as much as Vincent is, but everytime the movie points up that fact, Altman switches to something else. There are some stunning scenes, however: the whole sunflower painting scene, for example, with Van Gogh going through the agony of trying to paint them to his exacting standards, and then the shot with the failed attempts in his dingy room - one's eyes bulge to take it all in. Worth a watch.",1136419200,8,950,5.012658227848101
2334174,5,B0009X7BHI,"The intimacy and intensity between the van Gogh brothers is that of lovers. You don't need to be physical to share the deepest emotions and relationship. My interest with Vincent began only after I read his letters to Theo. The brilliance of his art only caught fire after reading the intimate letters between these two brothers. Van Gogh's true genius and his deep and dark introspect and intelligence is revealed in these letters.

The performances of this well written script are directed toward a more mature and sophisticated audience. You feel the grit, humanness and frustrations both Vincent and Theo shared. Vincent's visits to Hell and the brothels reveal something of both the man and the artist. I can't imagine a more authentic portrayal.

Theo's frustration and love for his brother were electric. I have never seen more sparks between two people on the screen. Having read the letters, having read a couple biographies, and having come to appreciate van Gogh's work, I find this stunning performance and dvd a wonderful documentation on one of Humanity's great artists. Everyone involved deserves much praise.

Altman's documentary is also excellent. I highly recommend this dvd.",1127433600,7,1194,5.176165803108808

The dialogues, intense and poignant. The entangled existential universe of the genius with his lover-prostitue receive an objective approach as well as the crude scenes you use to expect.

2334196,3,B0009X7BHI,"A story of two Vincent brothers is interesting for not much knowing the issue especially.

Vincent, an older one, was a mentally-disturbed painter while a younger offspring late Theo, an art dealer selling his brother's works, suffered from syphilis.

Probably, such a historic drama could usually be presented with a great degree of producers' imagination-their personal vision of the data historical, of which ear-catting is, as proven recently, a deed of despair same gender attracted Vincent was involved in, not a self-mutilation during a mind-blackout.

From this viewpoint, all surrounding the affair between a painter and a prostitute-cum-model is not so dramatically-substantial for erection-affected Vincent as a movie attempted stressing on.

Two hour screening is too long anyway.",1317081600,2,792,5.686440677966102
2334197,2,B0009X7BHI,"Let me preface this review with a bit of my own background, as regards what I was hoping for, in this little-known film about the incomparable creative genius, Vincent van Gogh:
I have been a life-long admirer of his art, both the paintings and his voluminous , intensely personal correspondence with his art-dealer brother, Theo. I've been to Amsterdam, solely to see many of his originals, in the Van Gogh Museum there. I own numerous books about his life and art, including the complete three volume set of his letters to Theo, which director Robert Altman reportedly used as the backbone of this film. I have read Irving Stone's 1934 classic piece of historical fiction, ""Lust For Life"" probably half a dozen times, and own the 1956 Kirk Douglas movie version as well. My home is filled with various reproductions of Vincent's art, including even many of his charcoal sketch works, and a few more expensive oil reproductions, too. He is my favorite artist, and was my personal introduction to art in general, when at the unknowing age of 14 I stumbled into the Impressionist wing at the Art Institute in Chicago (my home town), and found myself transfixed in front of ""The Sower"". I doubt I'll ever be the same. Even my first kiss from a girl comes in second to the magic of that moment.

So you can see, when I stumbled on the many favorable reviews for this movie (""Vincent and Theo"") on this site (half of the 25 reviews to date consider this a 5 star movie), I bought a copy, sight unseen, hoping that the iconoclastic director Robert Altman would finally capture the full scope and intensity of Vincent Van Gogh's creative genius, as well as the endearing true story of Vincent's special relationship to his brother Theo. The script for that hardly needed much revision from the screen writer (Julian Mitchell), as Vincent's letters are as complete a script as has ever been written, as an unintentional autobiography of the man, and his art.

""Vincent and Theo"", directed by Altman, was released in 1990, but not available on the current dvd till 2005. It's rather long (140 minutes), yet makes a number of significant short-cuts, in order to concentrate on the brother's relationship, rather than the full story of Vincent's turbulent life. A major omission is Vincent's early attempts at being a minister, in the Borinage mining town of Belgium, where to this day he is known as ""The Christ of the Coalyards"", for his singular, selfless devotion to his work. An important omission for this film, as several times in ""Vincent and Theo"" Vincent makes comments about his lost faith, and it's clear that shaped both his subsequent life and art in a great way.....yet this movie gives us no glimpse into WHY he felt that way. I didn't think this emphasis on the brother's relationship was wrong in and of itself, as clearly Vincent spent his entire creative life dependent on Theo for both financial and emotional support.....indeed, it was only through Theo's (and subsequently his wife, Johanna's)belief in the quality of Vincent's art, at a time when no one considered him a serious artist,that his art even survived. The major fault I have in this movie, however, is simply that I didn't find the portrayals of the principal characters to be all that accurate. And more importantly, despite the unique artistry of Altman's many films, I didn't feel like it adequately captured the genius of the artist.

Tim Roth plays Vincent, in a portrayal a little too heavy on the unbalanced side- but clearly that's how Altman intended it to be. In the accompanying documentary with the extras on this dvd, Altman starts right off by saying of Vincent, from HIS take on Vincent's letters, that he saw Vincent as entirely selfish, ""always asking for money"", and clearly just ""mad as a hatter"". Suffice it to say, personally I think that is an amazingly shallow take on the real man, and it comes to make Roth's portrayal throughout this film also somewhat shallow, however intensely acted. Roth visually looks much like Vincent, though perhaps a bit too slight of frame- the real Vincent was by all accounts (and despite his seemingly endless state of malnutrition and abject poverty) a physically imposing man. 4-5 stars for Roth's commitment to the role as given to him, but 1-2 stars for the depth of the portrayal.

Paul Rhys plays brother Theo, a respected art dealer of that time, and a tireless champion for the unkown but emerging school of post-impressionist artists, of whom Vincent would eventually emerge as their champion. The real Theo was clearly devoted to Vincent, and made countless financial and emotional sacrifices on the artist's behalf. He probably also died from tertiary syphilis (affecting the brain), in an asylum in Utrecht, just 6 months after Vincent's suicide. But again, as played by Rhys in this film, Theo emerges as a constantly twitchy, emotionally bizarre individual, who clearly cares for Vincent, but the glue that bound them so inseparably was just missing in this, for me. Rhys also bears little, if any, resemblance to the real Theo, who so resembled Vincent that one of the self-portraits of the artist is now believed by many to actually be a portrait of Theo. I suppose I have a much longer, detailed explanation for this, and I know many who rated this film so highly would simply disagree on this point, but for me, it lessened the overall impact of this film.

Perhaps more glaring is actress Johanna ter Steege's portrayal of Theo's wife, Johanna. Their first name seems to be the only thing the actress and the real woman share in common. It was solely through Johanna's faithful persistence in keeping Vincent's art, after the death of the two brothers, that any of it even survives today. She clearly had a deep love and caring for Vincent, and this simply is nowhere to be found in ter Steege's portrayal.

There are many supporting characters that are better portrayed in this one, especially Wladimir Yordanoff's take on Paul Gauguin, but the heart of this movie is clearly in the two brothers.

The cinematography is well-done, with many on-location shots where Vincent created his better known masterpieces, especially his amazing burst of creative activity while in Arles, St. Remy, and Auvers, in the last months/days of his life. We see the fields of sunflowers that exploded onto his canvases. We see the waving wheatfields, the intense sun and mistral wind of southern France, and even the swarming black crows, over that final wheatfield. One scene that was absent, however, that I think would have been a powerful one, is Vincent under a starry night, while he was a patient at St. Remy. Opportunity missed, there.

The musical score I found way over-the-top, and even distracting. I'm sure it was intended to be a musical translation of the inner turmoil going on in the artist's mind, but for me it was overdone, and there was also almost no soft, tender, or sad music- odd for a man who was so clearly and intensely acquainted with deep, deep sorrow.

The inevitable movie comparison is to the 1956 version, ""Lust For Life"", starring Kirk Douglas as Vincent, and Anthony Quinn as Gauguin (for which Quinn won an academy award).Theo in that movie, however, was a rather minor character, though the actor still managed, IMO, to convey more of the caring relationship Theo had for his tormented brother. ""Lust For Life"" is a much more conventional, structured bio....""Vincent and Theo"" was shooting for something more than that. A noble attempt, but for my money, it still falls short. Far short.

I'd recommend ""Vincent and Theo"" to those who, like myself, are devoted admirers of the artist. For the casual viewer, however, I'm afraid it will only be a once-viewed flick, and for that reason, I'd rent, but not buy.
BTW: this movie is rated PG-13, entirely because of several brief scenes involving nudity- all of which are entirely appropriate for the story, as they all involve models posing for Vincent's work. Zero gratuitous nudity as far as sex goes, and no profanity whatsoever. Intense themes throughout, though, so probably not all that appropriate for children.",1314748800,24,8136,4.867870036101083
2334198,5,B0009X7BHI,"This is the BEST DVD, acted footage I have seen, that portrays the life of Vincent & Theo.  I have studied the artist in great extent, and every scene, every incident, is taken from real life incidents that are documented in the many letters and pieces of ART Work done by Van Gogh.  He was a determined, yet sick and tormented soul.
No other ARTIST has left such a chronological documentation of their life, their struggles and their sorrows.  Vincent did, and Theo gave his life to help him achieve that goal.  When they didn't, Theo's wife took over where they left off, and after death, their dream was realized.  This is WELL acted . . .the actor's playing the brother's seem to have taken over the minds of the individuals, and it is so touching and yet very heart breaking.
I have given this DVD to many other's to view; and even 'tho they are not Art Lovers ~ they have said after viewing it, that ""I Now feel like I know this artist, and can look at his paintings with a whole new light . . .""
I highly recommend this DVD.  (although, not so great for children's viewing, because they do throw in a little romance . . .)

2334199,5,B0009X7BHI,"A woefully overlooked film, this is one of my very favorite by Altman.  Amazing acting by Tim Roth and Paul Rhys, and the whole film is tremendously moving.

For me, Altman achieves a sort of dream state far more interesting than in the more critically acclaimed `3 Women'.  He manages to make you feel the whole story as completely real, as if you were there in history, and yet, it has a fractured, dreamlike quality, with moments left unexplained and mysterious, but always making emotional sense.

I don't know any film that better captures the pain of being an artist, or the pain of being unable to save someone you love.  Also, the whole film looks gloriously like a painting.

There is a longer version, originally made for European TV, but I actually think the rhythms are far better in the US theatrical cut.  The Euro version mostly adds tons of exposition that takes away from the mysterious, subjective tone that makes this work so well.",1282435200,6,950,4.686746987951807
2334200,5,B0009X7BHI,"Robert Altman is best known for his ensemble films with large casts as well as the use of people speaking on top of each other. Vincent and Theo does not follow either of those precedents. In fact this is the story of two brothers, beautifully filmed. It portrays Vincent painting in Provence and Theo a Paris art dealer and their relationship.
Don't miss the commentary by Altman. He says that his use of actors talking over each other,a technique used in his 1971 western McCabe and Mrs. Miller, did not originate with him. He cites numerous instances of the technique by Howard Hawks in his westerns. Some younger film directors, such as Sofia Coppola, have made recent films using the technique. You can see her effective use of it in the 2006 film Marie Antoinette.",1273017600,2,770,4.711111111111111

The portrayal of Theo's wife, Joanna Van Gogh, makes her out to be a cold woman who has no feeling for art or Theo's brother and his work.  History proves her to be quite the opposite.  In fact, without her the world might be saying, ""Van Gogh who?""

Vincent was a mentally ill man with an incredible talent who wanted nothing more than to teach people through his art and letters, recommending books he read and found helpful to those who he loved.  The only thing that he really desired was to be loved, it was the elusiveness of this and his depression over his complete reliance upon his younger brother that may have lead to his suicide.  He wasn't merely a crazed painter.  Watch it if you want to, but it is not at all accurate.",1236384000,7,853,4.360759493670886
2334202,1,B0009X7BHI,"Vincent & Theo, a 1990 film by director Robert Altman, may be the worst film ever made by a major director who has made a great film. Watching this two hour and twenty minute abomination left me, and my wife, stunned by its wretchedness. From the nonexistent narrative, to the indulgence of every artistic clich imaginable by screenwriter Julian Mitchell, to possibly the worst soundtrack, by Gabriel Yared, ever used in a film (even worse than the estimably bad Robot Monster!), it's a wonder Altman ever crawled his way out from under the odium of this horrorshow, the nadir of his career- even more so than Popeye a decade before. Yet, his very next film, The Player, somehow relaunched his career. If I can indulge a clich, maybe it really can be darkest before the dawn!
  I have still yet to see a successful film made on the life of a real artist, where all the clichs were not utilized. Perhaps the closest to that ideal was Amadeus, save for the fact that its protagonist was not Mozart, but Salieri, and the story was the latter's envy of the former's talent, and the truth was that that whole film was an almost total fiction.
  This film, however, does not even address the artistic impulse, and the paintings, which is the ONLY reason anyone gives a damn about Vincent Van Gogh, his suffering, or even his brother. Altman states, in the featurette, that what interested him were Vincent's letters to Theo, yet we NEVER get a hint of what they say, only one ridiculously melodramatic scene where a raving Theo bitches at his wife's opening up of the letters.
  Altman's always been at his best in ensemble pieces, like Nashville, M*A*S*H, The Player, and Gosford Park. He seems utterly adrift in this intense de facto two person stage play where both actors wildly overact, as if they were in a Roger Corman 1960s comic-horror version of Lust For Life, save with British accents, not Dutch.
  Vincent & Theo is a horrible film, in its own stolid way as bad as Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, but it seems even worse because Spielberg's never come within a light year of a film as complex as Nashville. There is no progression nor insight into Vincent Van Gogh in this film, nor even his brother. When the brothers die we do not care, nor do we have an iota of insight into Altman's ideas on life and art. Vincent's graffiti that `I AM THE HOLY SPIRIT. I AM WHOLE IN SPIRIT.' are not only dull and trite, but not given a shred of evidence one way nor the other by Altman. I could go on and on, and list a few dozen other reasons why this is easily Altman's worst film, and a terrible film, period, but hopefully I've earned enough trust with my readership that I can tell them to simply skip this one and watch Lust For Life instead. It's a better film, and more intellectually honest, to boot. Ok, exhale!",1222128000,7,2845,4.54296875

Theo did support Vincent financially and spiritually. But I don't think it was fair to portray vincent as a totally raving leech either. Paul Gauguin was given way too much credit for being a good friend, when in real life he was using Vincent for essentally pay. The ear incident was taken completely out of context as well. Having said that, the movie wasn't that bad. It was well acted and artfully photographed. I had high expectations and that may be why I was a little dissapointed in it.

2334209,5,B0009X7BHI,"Director Robert Altman has with this film accomplished something biographers, writers of fiction, art historians and yes, filmmakers, have failed at for so long: to give us a convincing portrayal of painter Vincent Van Gogh's life without falling too deeply into the harmful stereotype of ""the mad genius"" or trying to explain him away as a severely ill man who happened to have groundbreaking talent.

Both Tim Roth and Paul Rhys give exquisite, painful, but never over the top performances as two men who are intimately linked in a way that suggests something more than mere brotherhood. Outwardly they have very little in common aside from being biologically linked: Theo is an art curator who endures the daily trials of the average man with perhaps a little more poverty; Vincent is an isolated painter who operates from an area of the mind and spirit which allows him no rest and no integration into society.

Tim Roth's Van Gogh is a quietly explosive figure who walks in the avenues of his own unrelenting pain and occasional ecstasy at the revelations he has in the most uncanny situations--drawing a prostitue while defecating, for instance.  He is in some ways the opposite of Kirk Douglas' overbearing, sentimental painter who begs the world to understand him.  This Van Gogh just doesn't care and sneers at the world unless it really bothers him, and then he lets everyone know how he's feeling in a way that is not to be ignored.

Rhys make Theo as interesting if not more.  He is also ""somewhere else"", and not in the sense of a mere romantic cliche.  He is a staid businessman but, like his brother, he is violently unable to reconcile himself to the world around him which is mostly composed of phonies and mediocrities.  Throughout all the emotional outburts, all the ferocious fights between the two, there is an elusive thread of understanding that ties the two tightly together.

The scenes in which Vincent paints are not pleasant, as they are in so many other films.  His agitation grows throughout the film though Roth plays it with a kind of poker faced approach.  The lilies, flowers and all the things he sees so intensely do not bring him pleasure but buzz at him, attack his mind, creating the impossible desire to communicate his vision to others.

When Vincent realizes his ""psychologist"" is a corrupt, patronizing hack and that he is far too gone to be brought back to reality, his suicide is cold and impulsive.  The rest of the movie is like a car crash.  Theo cannot live without his brother and can no longer maintain the social fictions that allowed him to make a living before.  And his syphillis is beginning to destroy him.

This movie is a masterpiece and will probably be the cinematic last word on the relationship between these two legendary figures in the history of art.",1181779200,35,2816,4.775257731958763
2334210,5,B0009X7BHI,"This is my favorite Altman film, and I think arguably his best film. However it is unquestionably the best film on Van Gogh.

My title for this review states that this is a dark film, perhaps a more fitting adjective would have been sober. The overall mood is fairly stern as Vincent's own mood appears to have been as well.

I can understand why some people may feel this film is insipid (although the adjective used by another reviewer was dull), the same way I could understand why many people might feel that Van Gogh's paintings are brutish and simplistic if it weren't for the fact they've constantly been told otherwise by the art establishment. In the end I just believe Altman nailed his subject, and this film ranks as one of the very best biographies on Van Gogh.

Tim Roth's performance was also very very good, and while so was Kirk Douglas' melodramatic performance in Lust for Life (a 1956 Hollywood film about Van Gogh), Roth has probably given us something much closer to the truth.

In short this film probably gets us as close to the reality of Vincent's last few years as we're able to come, and this ironically might be why some people dislike the film. Despite the popular image of Van Gogh as an expressionistic, even manic, personality, he was, the evidence suggests, a pensive, inflexible man who exuded an oppressive seriousness. No matter how much you like his paintings, now, he probably wasn't a person whose company you would have enjoyed, then.",1178755200,10,1475,4.705426356589148
2334211,1,B0009X7BHI,"It seems all the reviewers of this film are big fans of Van Gogh, and who isn't?  But it remains a bizarre shame that Robert and Vincent didn't mix well at all.  Between a silly script, mediocre acting and absolutely dull photography, this picture is one that neither could sell.",1178236800,6,279,4.56

Don McLean ""Vincent (Starry, Starry Night)

Robert Altman's ""Vincent & Theo"" (1990), is as beautiful, powerful, and disturbing as the life of a man who could create the richest, most exiting paintings, who could never paint from his imagination but only by what he saw. How he saw the world around him was extraordinary. The life of the artist was not glamorous, it was depressing and self-destructing but as a result of his Art, we all have became a little richer, happier (even if for a moment) and better.

Based on letters written by Vincent van Gogh to his art-dealer brother Theo, this is a wonderful cinematic biography, perhaps one of the best ever made about the life of a painter. Tim Roth was sensational and Robert Altman IS one of the greatest directors of all times. His film looks at us through Vincent's eyes, and for two hours we are in Vincent's world of madness and genius.",1176768000,3,1046,4.657608695652174
2334213,5,B0009X7BHI,"This film is powerful, poetic and highly evocative of the most likely real relationship between Vincent and Theo. You constantly feel the underlying stress and yet great love between the two brothers.

It takes an artist like Robert Altman (and his son Stephen the set designer) to make great film about a great artist.",1173312000,5,319,4.907407407407407
2334214,5,B0009X7BHI,"If you like Robert Altman or Van Gogh, see this movie; if you like Robert Altman AND Van Gogh, buy this movie.

It's much better than the old Hollywood ""classic"" ""Lust for Life"" which painted a much more palatable, commercially-friendly version of Van Gogh. Altman, however, is and never has been interested in commercial film-making and his film recasts the story of Van Gogh with his characteristically grim and beautiful realism.

The film might be Altman's overlooked masterpiece, and its obscure fate was, in my opinion, the result of its being originally released on television in England instead of in movie theaters around the world.

This movie's portrayal of the co-dependent relationship between the Van Gogh brothers is gorgeously filmed and appropriately dark. The realistic dialogue and the cinematography are terrific, and Tim Roth's warts-and-all performance as Vincent is particularly thrilling to watch.

Roth's portrait of the artist is not endearing like the one created by Kirk Douglas. But even though Roth's Vincent is self-righteous and fervently anti-social, he is also a brilliant and unpretentious artist whose failure is linked to his inability to adapt to the world or to the people around him. Still Roth's Vincent is able to appreciate the world's beauty through his art, and we see him work feverishly to share his gift with an indifferent world.

This is where his character manages to elicit sympathy, capturing the zeitgeist of the modern artist who, by refusing to compromise his art for commercial interests, becomes marginalized as a result. And it's this aspect of Van Gogh's life and work with which Altman most clearly empathizes.

Though much more successful than Van Gogh during his own lifetime, Robert Altman was a filmmaker who made non-commercial films outside of the Hollywood studio system that made hack-work like ""Lust for Life."" And it's sad that the result of Altman's efforts went direct to television. It's a shame though it certainly is fitting considering the theme of his beautiful ""Vincent & Theo.""",1170633600,5,2057,5.19939577039275
