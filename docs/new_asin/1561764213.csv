7796232,1,1561764213,"Firstly, it comes as a huge surprise to me that the ""Journey Within A Journey"" is available at Amazon.com, but the price of the DVD--exorbitant to say the least--did not shock me. In desperate situations, people often try to market garbage by creating an aura of exclusivity around the product.

I had the opportunity of viewing this docudrama (surely, it cannot be termed a film) when its creator Chitra Neogy, in an attempt to generate buzz for it, gave it to me for my personal viewing. Well, it's the work of a very clumsy amateur with no creative talent whatsoever. The ""Journey With A Journey"" will take you, at best, on a 90-minute journey of little else but revulsion, leaving you, at its end, with one question only: What was all that about?

All you potential viewers: Please spare yourselves the horror of watching Neogy's pice de rsistance.",1231200000,,852,4.75

7796234,5,1561764213,"When I saw Chitra Neogy's feature film,""A Journey Within A Journey,""I was struck by her vision and courage to create a film that explores an inner drive to evoke a meaningful dialogue about death and life  as a learning process. Through Chitra's visually dynamic journey through  India,the film  reveals the ancient forms in India and how they can still  inspire us today. In her earlier film,""Woman-Self"",Chitra examines  the life of the artist and the conflicts that exist to express oneself  cretively. Her films take numerous risks by sharing her understanding of  life and making that accessible to broad audiences through the medium of  film.
  I have also seen Chitra perform,speak at numerous events and have  her poetry. She continues to educate the need to explore the truth in art  and life,to not compromise and to face one's struggles to make one's  art. She communicates the depth of human nature through a personal  exploration and the importance for the artist to create without concern for  commercial success. She is a powerful teacher by example.",950227200,2,1065,5.07514450867052
7796235,5,1561764213,"I have been a student of the religious life of India for many years. At the same time I am an outsider to its religious visions. From time to time I have acknowledged both professionally and to students that it seems to me  inevitable that many parts of the relogious life of peoples remain,even  after protracted study,an area of darkness. For me,the worship of Kali has  remained one of those mysteries. In the midst of my quandries,I have come to  appreciate the way in which images allow the mind atleast to hold on to the  notion of the unknown. Your beautifully photographed film and poetic  commentary are wonderful. Together they hand over images to hold in one's  mind for thought. I was deeply moved by your film in ways which I cannot  adequately express. Your willingness to link your fathers death and the  urgency to see it in relation to your own spiritual questions rooted in  your India provides me with the human frame in which to follow your  quest. It is that identification which permits a glimpse of Kali,the  polarities of destruction and creation,fire and sun. In my mind's eye I  shall always see the wondrous chalk images of Kali so lovingly traced on  the earth and the two young girls obliterating them. The very notion of art  destroyed is such a scandal. But,it is the dance of the young women on the  image which signifies the Life,Kali or so I have thought. Thank you for  your film. I look forward to the opportunity to show it to my students.",950227200,2,1476,4.593869731800766

7796237,5,1561764213,"I have been screening films at the museum for a while,and I have never seen a film touch the audience as deeply as your film. Everyone can relate to loss and the healing process or journey we must take to heal ourselves.  Through evocative imagery and poetic narration,you introduce people not  only to the richness of India's culture,but also to the rebirth that occurs  when we allow ourselves to be transformed by events that seem as though  they were mesnt to destroy us. Being a visual person,there are many images  in the film that I will hold in my mind as reminders of the film's  optimism. Thank-you for bringing the film to the National Museum of Women  in the Arts and leading the post film discussion. I am pleased that we  showed the film in conjuntion with the Environmental Film Festival giving  it a wider exposure to the Washington Metropolitan area.",949881600,,867,4.688741721854305

7796239,4,1561764213,"While numerous visual and literary artists,ethnographers,screenwriters and directors attempt to capture the post-modern impulse to transcend boundaries in both geography and genre,the result is often contrived or  incoherent. Chitra Neogy,on the other hand,has managed to piece together a  seemless montage of images,words and music which effortlessly combine  ethnography,poetry,and cinematography. Together they tell the compelling  story about coming to terms with the death of her father. Hers is a  narrative which dips into the wells of humanity and brings to parched lips  the liquid essence of life. While personal,this film engAGES The viewer on  an intellectual as well as an emotional level. We are compelled to think  about ritual,symbol,and cultural forms in Kerala and how they infuse the  everyday lives of people here with renewed meaning. Yet we do not see a  static representation of the past or an over-romanticization of village  life. By contrast,scenes of what might be called traditional life are  juxtaposed with images of bustling city life:buses,storefronts,busy streets  and other tokens of ""modernity"".In addition,we never lose sight  of the artist whose narrative weaves the pieces of this story together and  whose presence in many sequences breaks down the subject-object divide that  marks most ethnographic accounts..",949881600,,1350,5.776649746192893
7796240,5,1561764213,"I have seen Journey over twenty times. And each time I watch it, it is like a visual poem. Chitra's rich, textured voice takes you on a Journey into the inner and the outer. The film is set in Kerala and you visit temple art  forms, over five thousand years old. Journey takes you in. It has many  layers, that takes several viewings to take them all in. People used to  seeing a typical american film, where you figure out the story in five  seconds, and are visually attacked with violence for two hours, will see  Journey as an experience. Because Journey requires you to sit, watch and be  with yourself. It is a Journey of transformation.",949881600,,643,4.452991452991453
