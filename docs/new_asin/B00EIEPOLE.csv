5915372,5,B00EIEPOLE,"After one boring night, I stumbled across a random sketch on youtube. Needless to say I was hooked. I think it was the sketch called Sedious says so. These sketches are super funny, and I have gotten all my friends to watch them as well.",1384473600,7,237,4.288888888888889
5915373,5,B00EIEPOLE,I watched a few segments of Studio C on BYUTV and was very wholesomely entertained! It's nice to see clean comedy these days. I was thrilled when I discovered Season 1 & 2 for sale on DVD! AWESOME! I'm planning to purchase several and give them as Christmas gifts to my children's school teachers and a few family members.,1382572800,8,322,4.47457627118644
5915374,5,B00EIEPOLE,"For anyone looking at a comedy along the lines of Saturday Night Live (at least the classic seasons of the past) with a wholesome twist, Studio C is for you. The talented foursome, along with many other brilliant studio players, bring many hilarious skits about life, love, and dating. Matt Meese is multi-talented as the Shoulder Angel who comes to the aid of those ready to sin. He climbs up their body (brilliantly choreographed sometimes by the BYU cheerleader squad) to help them make the right choice. It is hilarious when he attempts to climb on the shoulder of 7'6"" Shawn Bradley or ""attempts"" to get to the President of the United States shoulder as he battles the secret service working to stop him from approaching. You'll laugh as a seemingly mundane 5-day forecast turns into World War 3. The cast has many skits relating to Harry Potter and other classic hits. The most annoying people you meet on Facebook skit had me laughing out loud as I related each person to someone I know. There are so many fresh ideas and without sexual innuendo, or cheap tawdry attempts at sexual humor this will become a fun family event to watch most of the skits. I will say a few might not be appropriate for the younger groups; for instance a young student comes to a professor's house for a family barbeque and has to avoid being eaten by their zombie son (hilarious)...but there is no swearing and I highly recommend this DVD. The series is now in season 3 on BYUTV (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints family channel). I am Mormon but can tell you none of the skits deal with the Mormon Church or church doctrine, just fun old-fashioned clean humor. Check it out!",1382227200,23,1675,4.586666666666667

Reminds me of stuff you might see on the olden days Carol Burnett Show or maybe on SNL.  Best thing is that there's nothing here that you can't watch with your kids or . . . your parents.  Don't have to worry about offensive or vulgar content or even swearing.  Very funny and upbeat.  Great takes on dating.  Love some of the recurring characters.  You will not be disappointed.

5915399,5,B00EIEPOLE,"It's been several years since I was a BYU student and we don't have cable, so I had never heard of ""Studio C"" until I accidentally stumbled across seasons 1 & 2 in my local library.  I figured I'd give it a chance since it costs nothing to check out of the library.  My family and I were pleasantly surprised to find that this was actually quite funny.  There were only a few not-that-funny sketches...most really had us laughing.  Some particular favorites included ""Generation Gap,"" ""Foreign Exchange,"" and ""Five Day Weather Forecast.""

Overall, I think this show is significantly funnier than ""Saturday Night Live"" has ever been.  In fact, I recently started trying to watch Seasons 1 & 2 of SNL from the library.  I ended up fast-forwarding through most of the disks, then turned to my husband and asked, ""How in the world did this thing ever stay on the air??""  It was so stupid and boring with some offensive content and just lame humor.  Which leads me to the other big plus about ""Studio C"".....my kids can watch it with me, and they loved it as well.  Altogether a really great show by a talented group of clean comedians.  Loved it and am seriously considering buying it down the road.",1390867200,,1195,4.589622641509434

5915404,5,B00EIEPOLE,"These guys can make even the most ardent sour puss smile. Their skits never offend and just cleanly poke fun at everyday life. My 13 year old can watch this over and over.

5915405,5,B00EIEPOLE,"**A DVD was provided for me to review--I was not compensated for this review**

Youre probably wondering what Im doing reviewing a TV show. Generally I wouldnt have agreed to do this, but Studio C is something special, guys. I was first introduced to the group of weirdos that make up the cast of Studio C through the most amazing music video Ive ever seen. Ever since then Ive been following this group of oddballs, and so when Studio C first came into existence I was among its earliest watchers.

Studio C is basically the family friendly version of Saturday Night Live. As much as I like Saturday Night Live, at the end of the day its sort of depressing, and living in a tiny house full of children, its probably not the wisest thing to have playing on TV. Studio C, on the other hand, is made by a bunch a nerdy college kids who like to keep it clean. (What can I say? Its Utah!) And to anyone who thinks that theres no such thing as clean humor, I dare you to try to watch a full episode with a straight face.

Their skits feature a wide variety of different styles and techniques, and are always incredibly witty. Each actor has a distinctive personality and style, which makes their performances hilarious and memorable. Their skits also have a wide appeal to all sorts of people. Its impossible for my family to agree on anything, but they all manage to get something out of Studio C, which itself is a miracle.

But the thing that really makes me love this show the most is how genuine it is. These people like to make people laugh, and they're good at it. Sometimes it comes off as corny, or justweird, but its still genuine.

If I could list all my favorite skits I would, but I cant. Though I do love those which feature an assortment of literary puns, grammatical errors, or tongue twisters. As for which ones those may be, Ill leave it up to you to find out",1387756800,8,1872,4.35243553008596
5915406,5,B00EIEPOLE,"Studio C gets three F's from me: Funny and Family Friendly. Love the entire cast. LOVE this show! Think of SNL (Saturday Night Live) only all the skits are clean. These shows are laugh-out-loud hilarious. They have reoccurring skits where the main characters are always present, only the situation changes.

Skits like:
Shoulder Angel (How this guy is able to ""climb"" people is both funny and amazing)
Ann, the librarian who expresses herself thorough book titles (Both creepy and hilarious)

There are also independent skits:
Gollum's Rescue is an outstanding display by one of the main actor's, (Jason) ability to do impersonations. He's fantastic.

A skit titled Poker Face is also one of my favorites. Uno, anyone??

Needless to say, I love this series. It is truly a FAMILY friendly show. Every Sunday we gather around the TV with a  large bowl of popcorn and watch taped episodes of Studio C. My hubby and I never have to worry that a skit will take an embarrassing turn and we'll have to scramble to turn the channel.",1387497600,,1024,4.795454545454546
5915407,4,B00EIEPOLE,"4 STARS

 It's a comedy sketches with clean humor. Most of the episodes that I have watched I have laughed at. A few misses for me.
 The one was a computer sketch that I could not read but that's more because I could not read it.

 There is a lot of physical sketches. One such is a angel on shoulder and guy was climbing all the other shoulder to warn them of wrong doing. It was funny how climbing up all over the different guys to talk them out of a robbery. Then later there was a devil on shoulder to try and talk them into making wrong choices. Than the last sketch had the angel on the shoulder to Shawn a very tall basketball player. The angel had a long climb for that one.

 There were some comedies that were musical. I specially like the marriage proposal acceptance song and dance I think it was a play off Chicago.

 There was a blind date with Tom Riddle that was funny. Another sketch that had dobie fired.

 It was a very entertaining dvd. I think it would be fun for all ages but mainly teenagers and young adults would really enjoy it.

 I was given this dvd for purpose of reviewing and posting a honest review on blog tour.",1386979200,,1144,4.168949771689498
5915408,5,B00EIEPOLE,"I had never heard of Studio C, but I love sketch comedy. Im a big fan of shows like (the old) SNL, SCTV, and The Carol Burnett Show. So when this review came up, I watched a couple of sketches on Youtube, and thought, Thats not so bad. Well. Just watching the first three episodes made my face and abs hurt. When I wasn't laughing out loud, I was smiling  like a huge, cant-stop smile. I was watching the DVD on my laptop downstairs and the kids kept yelling down the stairs asking me what I was laughing about. I took the laptop upstairs (they were playing video games on their TV and I didn't want to lose their spot) so they could watch one episode. Its a family-friendly show, but I wondered if kids would get the humor. They didnt, for the most part. They both laughed at the Shoulder Angel skit. Im still laughing, and I watched it twice!

If you're looking for family-friendly comedy, you don't want to miss out on this show. There is no preaching or hidden attempts to convert anyone to any religion. Just clean, hilarious entertainment.

I received this DVD set free in exchange for an honest review.",1386979200,,1109,4.4
5915409,5,B00EIEPOLE,A great show for the whole family!  Our kids from 3 to 12 love it as much as we do.,1386979200,,83,3.15
5915410,5,B00EIEPOLE,"I sat my family down and we watched this DVD - they laughed and cried because they were laughing so hard.  Loved that it is a comedy show for the whole family.  My son said:  ""Its like Saturday Night Live, but you let us watch it because there is no swearing or other bad stuff in it.""

He is correct I worry about the kids watching other comedy shows due to the language and the content, but this is clean and for the whole family to enjoy.  I am so excited to have found this group - Studio C is funny and well worth watching with everyone in the room.

5 stars out of 5 - do buy it today.  Here is a link to Amazon to purchase this hilarious comedy DVD- it would make a great family Christmas gift - for anu family including yours.",1386374400,6,734,3.9863013698630136
5915411,5,B00EIEPOLE,Great for the whole family--clean and appealing to different ages. One of our family's favorites. Perfect for teenage movie nights and other get-togethers. I highly recommend this DVD set!,1386201600,,188,5.517241379310345
5915412,5,B00EIEPOLE,"Very funny and the shoulder angel sketch is worth the price of the DVD and while not every sketh is laugh out loud funny, the ones that are you will find yourself laughing about later. Not very many shows that kids, parents and grandparents will all enjoy. I have no problem unconditionally reccomending to anyone regardless of your viewing sensibilities.

8605704,4,B00EIEPOLE,"I bought this collection having seen only one preview clip (the hilarious one where two visiting missionaries are mistaken for mob enforcers), but it was reasonably priced and I had a strong desire for wholesome comedy.

This sketch comedy show produced by BYU fit the bill perfectly. My wife and I love this show! My only disappointment is that it appears on seasons 1 & 2 are available on DVD (we don't have cable) but some of the newer skits are online.

And it's definitely NOT just for Mormons. In fact, of the first 22 episodes (~125 skits) only the above mentioned missionary/mobster skit has any reference to Mormons. This is just clean, family fun with a charming, funny, and talented cast.

If I had to voice one complaint to balance out the praise, it might be that season 2 lost a little mojo compared to season 1. They fell into a bit of a groove (I don't want to say rut) which included several recurring skits. Unfortunately, the recurring skits usually aren't as funny as the original ones (I'm talking to you ""Captain Literal"", ""Just Jeremy"", the weird acronym/german researcher bit, and ""Awkward Avoidance Viking"" - which were all decent, but only do them twice per season please)... but overall, this is highly recommended - fresh, mostly original, and a lot of fun.",1442620800,2,1285,4.727678571428571
