6413160,5,B00KB613WM,Great Series. Too bad BBC didn't allow it a little more time to develop it's following. Two seasons and that's all. Bloody shame as it was an excellent series. Look forward to seeing season 2 even if it's the last ne.,1407456000,9,217,4.317073170731708

6413162,5,B00KB613WM,I bought afterlife season 1 and I LOVE it!! I am so excited to see Amazon is getting season 2!! This is one of the best series I have ever watched. Andrew Lincoln and Lesley Sharp are just incredible and so amazing. Andrew Lincoln as Robert Bridge is heartbreaking and amazing at the same time!! If you're an Andrew lincoln fan or a Walking dead fan (I AM BOTH) you will love him in this wonderful series. His performance is just incredible. On a scale of 1-10...I would give this series a 10. The writing/acting....and everything about this series is a 10. (imo),1401580800,9,563,4.475728155339806

6413164,5,B00KB613WM,"Season 1 was amazing and season two takes it to a whole other level.  Andrew Lincoln delivers another mind  blowing performance that takes you inside his character and the guilt he feels over an unpreventable tragedy.  Its a journey on the path to finding peace and it resonates with viewers in a thoughtful and beautiful way.  This is one of my all time favorite series and I am so thankful that I discovered it.  I am mesmerized by Andrew's portrayal of the character and find it a really lovely, compelling story.",1476144000,2,516,4.626373626373627

6413193,5,B00KB613WM,"Wow! I am ever more impressed with British TV. It's so far beyond Hollywood -- in the casting, in the acting and in the writing. If you aren't one of those Americans that needs a thrill a minute, this show will blow you away. Lesley Sharp is riveting, Andrew Lincoln is masterful.

6413199,5,B00KB613WM,"GREAT show.  Superb acting.  This was my first exposure to both Lesley Sharp & Andrew Lincoln of The Walking Dead fame, when this series first came out on BBC America in 2005.  Suspenseful & eerie, without going too over the top.  If you like British TV, I'm sure you will like this...even if your not a big 'goes bump in the night' kinda' viewer.",1430265600,,347,4.375
6413200,5,B00KB613WM,enjoyed both seasons,1428969600,,20,6.0
6413201,5,B00KB613WM,"In Series 1, we met the tattered and battered by life Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp), washed-up in Bristol. Fans of ""Scott and Bailey"" will appreciate the superb Lesley Sharp - her acting is mesmerizing. Her Alison suffers emotional and physical scars. Lesley Sharp, as Alison Mundy, plays the character impeccably, with such depth and conviction, that she makes even the less credible stories more believable. Alison must come to terms with her psychic sensitivity, living with one foot in this world, the other the cold side of the grave. When she walks the hilly streets of Bristol, she is often unsure if the people she sees are really alive, or if they are restless spirits. Her narrow town-home is an artifact, marking her oddness, out of step with time, stuck in a previous period: 1970's avocado green looms in patterned wallpaper that is beyond retro, its dank hideousness dominates. Vinyl records are stacked on the floor; even her phone is old-fashioned.

Series 2 drops the train-wreck story-line; Alison seems more maladjusted than before, with new, irritating quirks such as head-on-wall banging and OCD. The sorting of Smarties may induce hunger (these U.K. candies are like M&Ms, but with a vanilla-flavored sugar crust). Not until Alison resolves her issues with her father, and freakish dead mother, does she begin to seem less afflicted with hysteria. The whole story-line with Alison and her mother-issues is done with a heavy hand, scrawling ""End of the Series"" on the wall. But the last two episodes, ""Things Forgotten"" and ""A Name Written In Water,"" are excellent, weaving together her relationship with Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln) and his grief over Josh, coming full-circle in a powerful and profound way.

The topics and stories of ""Afterlife"" exclude jolly cheerfulness; the spirits that contact Alison are troubled, damaged souls, with terrible, violent ends and unresolved issues. Some of these spirits even have deadly agendas towards the living. Overall, this is an interesting, experimental series that deserves a wider audience. Just don't watch this by yourself, if you're easily spooked!",1428883200,6,2122,5.219941348973607
6413202,5,B00KB613WM,A very compelling series.  Keeps you guessing and doesn't go for easy or obvious solutions.,1426636800,,91,5.066666666666666

6413207,5,B00KB613WM,Loved this series!  It is so well done!,1424304000,,39,3.875
6413208,2,B00KB613WM,"This season wasn't nearly as good as the first. In this season, our medium protagonist Alison goes crazy. Her constant screaming, binge drinking and nasty remarks got really annoying and took away from the individual stories. I'm assuming writers decided to focus on an Alison journey this time around, because the first season had an overall story arc of Robert, the skeptical professor, dealing with his grief and disbelief. That arc was well executed. Alison's was not.

The individual hauntings were not nearly as interesting as the first season. There seemed to be more of a push for bizarre and shocking, rather than really good stories. There was only one episode I really enjoyed, about a boy haunted by a kid in a scary mask, carrying a purple balloon.

Robert is back to being his skeptical self. SPOILER: He learns he is dying. It's not difficult to figure out what's going to happen at the end of the season. Hello, he's friends with a medium!

Overall, I felt like this was a sad way to end this short series from BBC.",1423699200,,1031,4.685082872928176

6413210,4,B00KB613WM,"If you like shows about the supernatural then this series is for you.  The lead actors are not the ultra attractive type that Look good but can't act.  She's a normal looking, if not frumpy, slightly disturbed woman.  I like British TV for casting talent over beef cake.",1422748800,,270,4.583333333333333
6413211,4,B00KB613WM,Great show the only problem i had was that it didn't always flow very well at times,1422403200,,83,3.9411764705882355
6413212,5,B00KB613WM,"Love this series! I wish there were more seasons. Great acting, I love English series - even shows meant purely for entertainment lack the shallowness you see in a lot of American television.",1421884800,,191,4.818181818181818
6413213,5,B00KB613WM,"This was a really good show, if you like the subject matter.",1420934400,,60,4.083333333333333
6413214,5,B00KB613WM,"This is an absolutely incredible show. It is based upon the same woman that the US series MEDIUM was, Allison. So this is a psychic, the woman, and a psychologist, Robert and they come to work on cases together. Her visions are extremely shattering and this actress is utterly convincing about these psychic experiences. There were only two seasons of the show. It went no further. A lot of the second season is taken up with Robert finds out he has a brain tumor. Allison is completely torn apart by this and the show becomes even more edge of your seat as a result. This show can be quite frightening yet absolutely believable. It is one of my favorite UK shows of all time. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1420848000,4,712,4.484615384615385

6413217,5,B00KB613WM,"Anyone expecting a scary story here is in for exactly what they expected, but there are bonuses along the way. I've seen people post that there is ""nothing new here."" I could not agree less. In addition to a story of a psychic and a skeptic, we also get the stories of the people involved in the hauntings, the mysteries, the twists, the human grief and the deep sense of dread. We get the slowly developing sense or mortality, and hints about what might be waiting at the end for all of us. There are many layers of story within this series. I loved series one, and series two exceeded my expectations. Some of the best writing I've ever run across in a supernatural series and the acting is top notch. Phenomenal.",1420329600,8,715,4.424242424242424

At first I was slightly miffed that I had to buy this series instead of renting it, but now I am glad that I own it as I know I will watch several times.
