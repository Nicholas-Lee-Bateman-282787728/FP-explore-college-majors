8500656,5,B006MBF308,Loyal to the story and my students loved it. Some winks to other Poe stories too. Good for class or personal viewing.,1353283200,,117,4.363636363636363
8500657,5,B006MBF308,"This video is an ideal choice for my 8th grade students.  They enjoyed it very much. The DVD contains two levels of fright, just in case you are watching it with younger/squeamish people.",1344988800,,187,4.666666666666667
8500658,3,B006MBF308,"I ordered this because not only am I a huge Poe fan, I am writing my thesis about Poe and visual culture. This film views like an amateur final project for an animation course. That being said, it is probably a great success for the filmmaker for whom this was practically a sole enterprise. I am not sure if it was worth the $20, but I am always happy to support a fellow artist. A 3 star rating is perhaps a little generous, but to be fair, I wasn't expecting 5 star quality. If you're a Poe nut and want to see a nice little fan homage to Poe, give it a go, but if you are looking for a decent film adaptation of Poe's work, check out Roger Corman's films.",1327449600,4,659,4.038167938931298
