4669302,5,B005EXA8B4,"Available previously only through viewing at MOMA in a battered workprint, THE LETTER is one of those revelations in classic film that compels you to reevaluate how one looks at acting and performance in the early talkie era.  Mythologized as extremely stagy and with rolling diction and ""round tones,"" (see SINGIN' IN THE RAIN for examples of this) there would be the occasional film from that era that does not fall into that trap.  True, there are performances in this film (Reginald Owen, O. P. Heggie) that do perpetuate the stereotype, but Herbert Marshall (in his U. S. debut) and especially Jeanne Eagels most assuredly do not.

That Eagels was even nominated for Best Actress for this film was a small miracle, considering that she passed away between the time of the film's release and the Oscars announcement.  That she lost to Mary Pickford, that era's female superstar and married to Academy president Douglas Fairbanks at the time, is not surprising, considering all the campaigning she did with Academy members in private beforehand.  But to compare both performances, Eagels leaves Pickford in the dust, as does the film (COQUETTE is one of Pickford's worst films, hands down, and her win is one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in the history of the Academy), and that we now have Eagels' performance to watch whenever we want is one of the best movie moments of 2011.

This is a full-out, ballsy performance that I can only compare to Heath Ledger in THE DARK KNIGHT (sadly, another performance that, posthumously in this case won an award).  Both are not afraid to portray a character that you cannot like and who have no remorse, but both Eagels and Ledger appear to have approached their roles without a net and just became the characters and the results are breathtaking, to say the least.  They come within a whisker of overdoing it but the passion of both sells what they are doing so that when it is over, your mouth is hanging open with wonder and you just cannot believe what you have just seen-it is that good.  It is like you have never seen that actor before and the character has just slapped you in the face.  You can also tell this was made before the Production Code was enforced-Eagels proudly proclaims that she still is in love with the man she killed, and that is where the film ends!  By 1940, the character had to pay for what she did, and with her life.

This version was supposed to be included with the Bette Davis version when that came out on DVD a few years ago-it was so disappointing to see it left off.  Thank the movie gods that Warner Archive has finally made it available to us.  The image quality is a bit rough-they were working off the only existing 35mm nitrate print-but Eagels shines through.  DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!!!",1314576000,47,2782,4.660531697341513
4669335,5,B005EXA8B4,"This movie is fabulous not just because of the acting skills of Jeanne Eagels which are brilliant, but just about every character in this movie.  Honestly, it makes the Bette Davis version pale by comparison.  In the first two weeks that I had this DVD, I watched it three times and enjoyed it each time as though it were the first time seeing it.  There is no ""fat"" in this movie, rather each scene is brilliantly edited and directed and acted out so well.  The scene where Mrs. Crosby goes to the Chinese quarter is unlike no other that you've seen or are likely to ever see again.  It's a hit for me and so grateful to Turner Classic Movies for playing it one night giving me this great movie-watching experience.  It's amazing how many little gems are out there that we don't even know about unless we happen to trip over them one night!",1418428800,3,841,4.393548387096774

4669338,4,B005EXA8B4,"The movie itself is okay, but Jeanne Eagels is just incredible.  You really feel like she IS the character.  She should have won awards for this performance.  Her only other talkie is lost and their are mixed stories on her death shortly after these movies were made.  She was certainly a troubled person, but wow could she act.  A dark movie in some parts especially near the end.",1413331200,,381,4.544117647058823
4669339,4,B005EXA8B4,"The earlier version makes a very interesting contrast to the far more often seen Bette Davis re-telling.
Now first up it must be said that it's in fairly parlous condition, ....although certainly not ""unwatchable"".
It was apparently re-constituted from a single old nitrate-stock work-in-progress version.
Parts of the movie have no sound added as yet by the foley studio. Crowd scenes are totally silent, and the native orchestras play silently in several scenes which robs the setting of a lot of atmosphere.

All the dialogue is present though, ....and the story is intact, but quite a different version to the later one mentioned above.
Almost to a man, the male actors are still playing as if they are in a theatre. Over-projecting and using those ""Old Vic"" Shakespearean stentorian deliveries that characterise the style once used to play to an audience rather than a camera.

Jeanne Eagels shines as the adulteress Mrs Crosbie, ...who we see pumping the entire clip of bullets into the man who has just spurned her for a Chinese mistress.
Her subsequent lengthy speech on the witness stand is nothing short of a bravura performance. It even convinces us, ...and we KNOW she's guilty! Some of her later lines are not so convincing but this bit is a ""star-turn"".

Perhaps those of P.C. persuasions should be warned of what would be seen nowadays as quite rampant racism in this movie.
It was of course made before P.C. became de rigeur, but anti-Chinese sentiment is reflected in the story, the quite shocking at times dialogue, and the depiction of the ""den of iniquity"" run by the Chinese into which a white lady must literally descend down the longest staircase into the underworld.
 Entertainments in this subterranean nightclub cum brothel include a cobra vs. mongoose fight; (stock footage that's mysteriously OUTSIDE on rocks when it's supposed to be on the floor), ...and prostitutes held in a bamboo cage from which old Chinese letchers can make their selections.
The dialogue revolves around how the white lady cannot understand just how her ex-lover could reject her for ""a horrible yellow thing"" like the new mistress. The white lady says this to the face of the Chinese woman.
The ""white"" lady is also humiliated and taunted by the Chinese when in their environment, which is of course deliberately depicted as sleazy and unsavoury.
I'm sure this aspect caused some concern back in 1929.

As I said, ...times have changed, but this probably reflects more closely the actual language used by Somerset Maugham in his original story, when white supremacy was simply seen as a given.
The plot is well-known and revolves around the necessary retrieval of a very incriminating letter held by the Chinese mistress.
This early movie shows how static the camera remained, ...merely panning from the fixed spot rather than the constant re-setting up of angles we see now.
The actors perform to the camera too, rather than to each other. That having been said, and despite the flaring of the contrast from faded to bright due to the perilous condition of the original film, I enjoyed this immensely.
As said already, Jeanne Eagels performance is truly a wonderful depiction of a sexually frustrated woman, married to an unresponsive husband, and dying of boredom in some backwater rubber plantation amongst filthy natives and  ""dowdy planter's wives"". Her attempts and manipulation manage to trip her up and she realises she's ""lost"" but she's still defiant, even though she has killed the only man she loves. her rejection for a woman she considered her racial, social and human inferior was the ultimate trigger.
And yet we should not blame her. She was very much a product of the very prevalent attitudes of her time, which would no doubt have been reflected in the prejudices of the audience.

This early version does NOT show the eventual demise of Leslie Crosbie at the hands of the Chinese mistress that was fabricated for the Bette Davis version, but ends with the defiant confession from Mrs Crosbie that she STILL loves the man she killed.

Interestingly, Jeanne Eagels  actually suicided by drug overdose soon after this movie was released.
I think the viewer can see some of that instability and vulnerability coming through her fine performance here.

A recommended and fascinating period piece for lovers of movie history, specially if you have already enjoyed the Bette Davis version.",1389225600,5,4406,4.998635743519782

4669341,4,B005EXA8B4,"Based on his own 1926 short story, which was in turn based on a decade-old scandal in Kuala Lumpur, Somerset Maugham's 1927 play THE LETTER was a smash on the English stage.  After a popular New York production, the play went before the cameras in 1929 starring legendary actress Jeanne Eagles opposite notable actors Regenald Owen, O.P. Heggie, and Herbert Marshall.  At the time is was considered a stunning achievement, and although Eagles died under unsavory circumstances that same year, she nonetheless received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress--and to this day there are many historians who say she deserved the award much more than Mary Pickford did for COQUETTE.

The story is famous.  Robert and Leslie Crosby (Regenald Owen and Jeanne Eagles) live on a rubber plantation--and when Leslie's secret lover Geoffrey (Marshall) begins tire of her, she shoots him, kills him, and then claims she acted in self-defense to prevent him from raping her.  Public sympathy runs in her favor, but her lawyer (Heggie) discovers there is ""a letter"" written by Leslie that proves she is not what she pretends to be.  In order to prevent the letter coming out in court, Leslie must buy if from her dead lover's ""Asian woman,"" Li-Ti (Lady Tsen Mei.)  The famous 1940 Bette Davis version was made under the Production Code, and Davis could not play it to the conclusion Maugham specified.  Working the pre-code era, Jeanne Eagles did, and memorably so, and while the Davis film is more subtle, the Eagles film is unadulterated, hard-driving melodrama.

Unfortunately, time has not been particularly kind to this film.  There is a notion that cameras couldn't be moved during the early years of talking movies.  That isn't really so, but sound was such a headache that a good many directors preferred not to add to their problems with elaborate camera set-ups.  Director Jean de Limur essentially photographs the play like a play.  It is fairly static, and although adapted, the script seems like it would be more at home on the stage than on the screen.  And then there are the performances. Actors who worked in early talkies were trapped between the old technology of silent films and the new technology of talkies, and they weren't always sure about how they should perform.  The performances here are indicative of that.  They are very, very stagey, and while Eagles is clearly a brilliant actress, she is every bit as stagey as the rest and then some.  Nonetheless, the Eagles performance is a very interesting one, especially when compared with Davis' performance in the remake.  She is a trash, vulgar woman whose nasty habits have caught up to her at last.

This is really a movie for fans of early talkies, pre-code movies, and the memorable Jeanne Eagles.  All others will likely be less enthusiastic.  The DVD is made on order and comes with no bonus material of any kind--a pity, for a biography of Eagles would have been very nice.

4669342,5,B005EXA8B4,"WOW.  I faithfully keep and enjoy my vhs of 1940's Bette Davis version of The Letter, but this -- I'm groping for words.  It's gritty, tawdry, tantalizing in exploring literally a dark underbelly of the post WWI Singapore nightlife Somerset Maugham had to have known first-hand.  Americans playing Brits -- and some authentic Brits in cast -- in stagey accents are convincing enough in this film, and druggie, overwrought, scrawny Jeanne Eagels so perfectly portrays the slyly hypocritical adulterous wife, her hideous colonial racism splashed like a badge across the front of her frock. What scenes as she expostulates and pulls on her wiry blond hair, thrashing about and screeching, ""You vile yellow creat-cha!"" as the thwarted Chinese mistress makes her crawl and grovel while the ""sing-song girls"" behind their barricade laugh contemptuously.  The camera dollying up to glossily back-lit verandahs or shadowy stairs below street level, the crackling stillness of a faintly hissing soundtrack sparked with sudden bursts of dialogue and occasional clash of ""exotic"" music, make this 1929 movie as mysteriously enchanting as it was intended to be 83 years ago -- one can almost smell the joss sticks of incense wafting in doorways.  I hope all lovers of Somerset Maugham's work, familiarly fond of Bette Davis' stagey tour-de-force in her version, discover that they prefer this very early talkie venture -- it's truly unforgettable.

Wish the dvd had other little ""bells and whistles"" as features -- a bio on Jeanne Eagels, for example -- but the fact that this long-unavailable, in fact once lost, movie classic is now in print will help drag other obscure early talkies of 1929-1930 out of archive storage, I should hope.",1352160000,25,1726,5.168458781362007
4669343,5,B005EXA8B4,"Jeanne Eagles is so captivating. Her expressions and movements reach beyond the screen and the viewer is one with her in all her moods. Eagles makes sympathetic the self-centered amorality of Leslie Crosby, a lovely European woman socially isolated on a rubber plantation outside Singapore driven by jealousy and boredom to homicide. The misogynistic Somerset Maugham was a whiz at creating viperish, sexually hungry female characters, but Jeanne Eagles, fierce and frail, wrings all the sympathy possible from an essentially unsympathetic role. She is a treat to watch; this is no imitating of emotion, she draws them up from deep within. THIS is acting!",1343520000,22,655,5.3076923076923075
4669344,5,B005EXA8B4,"The movie is creaky, the production poor, but JEANNE EAGELS is absolutely fascinating! You will rewind her two or three scenes to watch them over and over again. One of a kind! A tragic loss that her career ended so quickly, so abruptly, but at least we have this tantalizing example of a unique talent.",1329523200,12,303,4.527272727272727
8469141,5,B005EXA8B4,"This movie is an excellent example of what supporters of the social experiment that was the Hays Code wanted to ban--life as it is.  A truly amazing performance by Jeanne Eagels that concludes with the moral ambiguity that is representative of life.  Also an excellent performance by Herbert Marshall playing the part of westerner willing engaged in an inter-racial romance.  The racial stereotyping throughout the film,  probably an accurate portrayal of the opinions of many of the colonialists of the time, is also a powerful statement of the cultural ignorance and racism so often found throughout western culture.  No Hays Code clean endings here as in the 1940s version.  Here people get to live with the consequences of their actions.",1519257600,2,741,5.133333333333334

8469144,5,B005EXA8B4,I've seen the Bette Davis version of The Letter and this one and found this version with Jeanne Eagles to be superior.  She is more emotional while Ms. Davis is more controlled.

8469145,5,B005EXA8B4,"The prologue of _The Letter_ states that this film was mastered from a 35mm nitrate print, long considered lost. There is no sound in the first few minutes, but that does not detract from the film. The dialogue is virtually intact.  It was adapted for the screen from W. Somerset Maugham's play of the same name. Not surprising that Eagels' portrayal of Leslie, the jealous and shunned lover, is more theatrical than cinematic.  There is a raw edge to Engels' performance. This, of course, makes sense because Engels learned her craft on the stage. This film is a gem, and we are very lucky to have it.  The story is an old one--Leslie, the neglected  wife of a rubber plantation owner, shoots and kills her long-time lover.  He has abandoned her for, all of things, a Chinese woman (remember, this is 1929).  Leslie is protected by her status as a white European woman and the wife of a plantation owner. She was merely protecting herself from a mad rapist.  All seems well for Leslie until an incriminating letter appears which implicates Leslie in a murder, not an attempted rape as she claims . This is where the real drama begins.",1455580800,5,1135,4.645

How emotionally raw, how down to the bone she was in that scene!  And, you believe her!  I can't understand how Mary Pickford won the Oscar for her stupid performance in ""Coquette""!!
