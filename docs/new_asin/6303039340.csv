8169334,5,6303039340,This movie was an interesting movie as it was pretty much the same type of movies that the other white Cowboys made. Herb Jeffries is a good singer as well. The story was a one similiar to a John Wayne or Roy Rogers movie. I enjoyed it very much. These people did an excellent job of acting. No doubt I will be viewing it again from time to time.,1192579200,,346,4.028985507246377
8169335,2,6303039340,"I liked the movie alright, however, the quality of the film was too dark and murky.  I realize that the film, at the time it was made, it was not in the best quality.  I also understand that the movie was made in 1939.  So dismissing, the above, the film was fine.",1181174400,,264,4.038461538461538
