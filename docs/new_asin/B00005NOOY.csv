1636666,2,B00005NOOY,"RAPTOR is a collection of scenes spliced from the three previous CARNOSAUR movies, and that in itself loses the movie at least two stars!!!
THE STORY: Banal and derivative, incoherent, and since it uses so much footage from the above mentioned movies, how can one judge this script on its own?
THE DIRECTION: Tepid and unimaginative.
THE CAST: Tim Abell was the only one I enjoyed in this movie; his supermacho Delta Force leader was the only life like performance. Teresa DePriest can't act; Corbin Bernsen overacts; and Eric Roberts and Melissa Brasselle are zombielike.
OTHER ASPECTS: The music by James Horner (why would this future oscar winner even do this?) It's banal at best. The special effects are mediocre, and the movie's climax rips off the third Carnosaur movie so blatantly, it's abysmal.
Shame on Roger Corman for stooping so low.
The two stars are mainly for Tim Abell!!!",1078790400,2,889,4.933333333333334
1636667,1,B00005NOOY,"I have to admit that ""carnisaur"" has been a guilty pleasure for me and friends. Although rediculously bad I didn't think it could get any worse...until now. Thanks to ""raptors"" I now no longer feel a reason to live. This movie was brutal in every aspect of film. I do enjoy B-movies every now and then, but when I rent one, I don't expect to see three other movies spliced together like a chinese fire drill. Every rule is broken in this movie: Bobcats tractors teleport from factories to deserts and transform into gigantic forklifts, a total lack of RAPTORS in the movie, the murders of random characters from other movies because it is sliced to horribly, and it becomes pitch black after 3:00 in a matter of minutes. I guess what I am trying to elude to is that I feel horriblly betrayed and cheated: the director's comentary even goes great lengths to avoid commenting on the issue of the blatantly obvious splicing and errors. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a good B-movie laugh...I recommend the originals first...then only then you will understand the true monstosity that is ""raptor""",1057968000,2,1099,4.7591623036649215
1636668,1,B00005NOOY,"CARNOSAUR was a true landmark in my 17 years of watching movies, in that it was the first one that I could not finish in one sitting (I had to take 2 breaks). The crummy special effects and gratuitous gore are not the problem (movies like BAD TASTE prove it can be done and be good). The problem was its utter rediculouslness, its tendancy to introduce characters for the sole purpose of killing them in death scenes that are far more revealing and even longer than the ones that introduced them. It was way to dark and gloomy to be considered campy fun. In a word, it bit.
But now here is RAPTOR, a Roger Corman movie that feels some need to re-make CARNOSAUR, this time sans human-incubation plot, with half of the film being stock footage of the 1993 abomination and the other half being brand new, 2001 abomination.
The surprise in this movie is that James Horner is on the credits. What a fun little excercise this must have been for him. (But no, the music isn't anything remarkable)",1055116800,2,989,4.469613259668508

It's just seeing people being alone then getting ripped apart! I stopped watching after 18 minutes. I figgered once you've seen one guy die you've seen the movie!

1636673,5,B00005NOOY,"You need to see Roger Corman's previous pre-historic carnivore film pieces before this one to understand the fluidity in camera angle spanning, spotlighting, flare-work, and plot mechanics in this stylistic and visionary work.  The acting is top-notch for the budget this film had.  This will be another one of those films that you go back to years later to catch a glimpse of early works of upcoming moviestars like Lorissa McComas, Tim Abell, and Ted Monte.
For those other reviewers that are just looking for some skin with this movie, go elsewhere, because this movie is so much more.  I've never seen a film like this, buy it!",1010880000,5,631,4.824074074074074
1636674,1,B00005NOOY,"The Lost World:Jurassic Park was an enetrtaining film of monsters and dinosaurs but because spielberg didn't have the heart for doing this again was slow at times; Raptor a total ripoff out and out stinks. Here's the scoop; a man caled Dr. Hyde after his project of working with dinosaurs to help man( why would anybody want to use dinosaurs to help man when there are already animals out there that can do this for us already) starts his project up again in secret with help from Pakistan. A raptor escapes(by the way there are no raptors in this movie the dinosaurs are actually t-rex's we learn) and kills three idiotic people in there old stupid looking jeep wrangler. The sheriff and an animal control expert whom he actually knows well investigate and turn up nothing of course. After many more victims become apparent and they are baffled they come upon an abandoned truck delivering chickens which was attacked by the raptors and eaten they find a book to unis corporation owned by Dr. Hyde. After some more brutal and senseless attacks on people to waste our time we finally get to the unis corporation and the sheriff and control expert are trapped by Dr. Hyde. The U.S. generals who operated jurassic storm (the name of the dinosaur project Dr. Hyde is running) and terminated it send an elite team of marines to stop and destroy the creatures after they find out that Hyde restarted the project. We meet our eal heoes then but unfortunately are only on screen for a mere 15% of the movie. Dr. Hyde is eventually killed by a raptor which is pushed over the edge literally by the sheriff in an unconvincing kat. A bomb blows and finally ends our misery of this film killing all the raptors and thats it. No dialogue no nothing no afterwards finding out what happened to the people when the destruction is finally done for. Doen't matter really because Raptor is horribly written, horribly directed, horribly produced, horribly acted, oh and yes poorly crafted special effects(even those special effects from the original Jurassic Park are much better and that was over ten years ago!). Think twice before getting Raptor.",1009497600,3,2130,4.7594594594594595
1636675,5,B00005NOOY,"This DVD had it all.  Good plot, good acting, and good action sequences although at times the Army guys didn't look like they were shooting at the target.  The Coup de Grace for this flick was Melissa Brasselle who not only provided good acting but was PHAT--PRETTY HOT AND TEMPTING.",1008115200,2,283,4.64
1636696,3,B00005NOOY,"Raptor is a rare kind of movie.(You don't see many movie's that take clips of other movie's and smash them all into one film that tries to be scary.) The Raptors look like people in rubber costumes, and eat people before they escape from any factory. In fact, within 2 minutes of the movie comes ""the jeep scene"", in which a baby Tyrannosaurus Rex(who I guess they try to pass as a small Raptor, even though the scene is from Roger Cormans Carnosaur), brutally mauls 3 teenagers. It hops inside the jeep they're in, and soon comes the over-the-top gore. That's easily the most violent scene in the movie, so if you can get past those first 3 minutes, you'll be O.K. The editor of this movie must be the dumbest man on earth, because there are mistakes everywhere. (It does make the film pretty funny though.) SEE a T. Rex from Carnosaur eat a cop from Raptor. HEAR a main character say ""Listen to the doctor honey, he's got a degree."" SEE a tractor from Carnosaur kill a T. Rex in Raptor. SEE a cop turn into a woman, when he was really a guy. HEAR people talk to someone when it's night, and SEE the person reply when it's day. SEE dirt change to blacktop. SEE a woman alone in an elevator get eaten by a Raptor with (all of a sudden) a lot of people. Also SEE a flashlight that she didn't have drop from her hands. These,(and many more) are what make this film funny. Also, the actors look sooo bored, and are two-dimensional.

1636697,3,B00005NOOY,"This is one goofy movie.

The raptor monsters look like people who are running around in rubber suits.  In fact as I think about that's probably what they are.

The writing has a similar quality.

Still if you've got nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon you might enjoy it.

1636698,4,B00005NOOY,"This movie takes footage from all three of the Carnosaur movies and makes a movie better than any of them.  The main characters are actually kind of interesting (which is something you'd never say about anyone in any of the 3 Carnosaur movies), and I actually found myself caring about them when they got in a tight spot.  It's also just a wonderful cheese fest.  My favorite part is when the Sheriff calls up the power company to ask them to turn off the power to a certain facility at a certain time.  He gets ahold of a customer service rep who looks like she should be saying ""Hi, I'm Buffy, and I'd like to tell you about a wonderful new offer from Time-Life books"".  Then she forgets to turn off the power when she's supposed to.  It's all good fun.  Other people like to complain about all the continuity errors caused by the blatant stealing of film from other movies, but actually it isn't bad at all.  If you like to nitpick that sort of stuff, this is the mother lode, but to the casual viewer you probably won't even notice.

Overall, I found this a very enjoyable B-movie.  Melissa Braselle is great in her part (and great to look at), the plot moves along well, and it's all good fun.",1146960000,6,1198,4.3558558558558556
1636699,4,B00005NOOY,"This was a rock on kind of film. I liked it a lot, and thought it was well made and filled with fighting, blood and gore, intense terror, and everything else one would want to see in an R-rated dinosaur flick. I don't know why some people put it down. I loved the nasty raptors and ferocious T-Rex, and of course the sex scene in the truck just before the girl's dopey boyfriend got ripped to pieces. And Dr. Hyde was a good villain. I also thought the blonde woman in it was hot, and that there were many cool quotes. And the guns? Forget it! They and their users were all that and a bag of chips. This movie is cool and well put together, and I recommend it highly! Only reason it doesn't get 5  stars is because the acting and ending could have been made a little bit better, but otherwise it rocks.",1122681600,6,802,4.141025641025641
1636700,3,B00005NOOY,"This movie is a total ripoff from the Carnosaur series. About 70% of the movie is scenes from the Carnosaur movies! However, this movie is fun to watch and is very funny. I mean, about two minutes into the movie and the dinosaurs are tearing people to shreads! This movies has tons of blood and gore, and fake looking dinosaurs. But if you are an open minded movie watcher looking for some low budget, cheesy fun, Raptor is for you!",1119916800,4,432,4.4125
1636701,1,B00005NOOY,"I saw this film with the rest of the Carnosaur films on this Marathon that was shown on TMC(The Movie Channel)So I decided to watch em' seeing how everyone is raving this film rocks.....I must say you people are idiots(no offense)but I guess it's alright for ""some"" people to enjoy fake rubber anomatronic Dinosaurs kill kill kill with a grim plot.  This movie was right after Carnosaur 3 and It was titles ""RAPTOR"".

This was complete B.S.  Raptor Had a terrible plot, lame acting and stupid stupid Dinosaurs(Jurassic Park totally takes down this whole series).  Raptor is just another rip off of Carnosaur and you can totally tell this only took the director 1 to 2 days to make.

Correct me if I'm wrong people, but were half of those no wait I'm sorry but was almost all those death scenes taken from all the Carnosaur films(i.e the woman who gets torn apart by the raptor who takes her from the elevator, the sherrif who battles the raptor at some street)cause if I remember a scientist with a white coat doesnt all of a sudden turn into some woman dressed in black getting killed by a rubber dinosaur.  I was so mad because the Director was either lazy to creat something new or he wanted a kick out of this I mean YOU DON'T PUT DEATH SCENEES YOU MADE IN YOUR PREVIOUS FILM AND PUT THEM ON ANOTHER FILM!  This was complete and utter [...].

I'm not trying to sound harsh or anything but this is one of the worst films ever created and with enough Gore(obviously taken from the other films)HORRIBLE ACTING, lame plot that I could give a care and Characters that really [...] off I give this piece of Doggy Doo doo a

It's a pretty predictable story but is fun to watch. For those who are fans of B movies or slasher flics with loads of pointless gore, this is your movie.",1101600000,4,315,4.096774193548387
1636703,5,B00005NOOY,"This one of the best dinosaur movies I have ever seen.  Not even Jurrasic Park III was this good.  A scientist has genetically created  velico raptors and 1  tranasaruas rex which you only she for about 15 percent of the film.
This is what happens there is a malfuction on of the laser cords malfuctions.  One  of the raptor  escape gets lose and kills some people.  The police man and his girl friend check out the murder.
They trace it to Uniscore were there they are later captured and prision buy Hades a scum bag.  He even  killed on of his employes because he thought her had lost his vision and forgotten his  vision.  Hades himself eventually dies is devour at the end by the T-rex after it escape from is storage area.
To make it better like python 1 and 2 and  Predator 2 the goverment are inevolved.  Hades  program at one point has been sponsored by the goverment  but after  one of the raptors escaped and killed some people abadon the project.
But Hades contiunes to do his research buy getting foreign  funding from Iraq. The goverment figures out that he reactivated project and send  armed marines on  a seek  and destroy mission.
Shortly after entering the building the  secretary under the sherrif order shuts  of the power.  By the time the power is turn back on the raptors and the t-rex are loose.
There are two fun parts in the move that rip of Aliens.  One when a lady in the chopter turn around there is a rapter in the helicopter it kill her then like in aliens the  helicopter hits the ground  and blows up instantly.
The other rip of Aliens is at the end when the police officer fight the T-rex",1081900800,7,1622,4.391891891891892

7947651,1,B00005NOOY,"The Carnosaur films were campy, cheapo, Roger Corman fun. They were bad, but they were meant to be that way and are actually a lot of fun. I highly recommend those films to a conissour of B - movie treasures. Now, what does any of that have to do with Raptor, you ask?  At one time, Raptor was supposed to be the fourth installment. What it turned into was a gigantic sewer pickle. In a nutshell, if you've seen the Carnosaur movies, you've seen the highlights of Raptor. The ""original"" elements of the movie are few and far between. The scenes with Roberts and Corben are really the only things that were shot. All the dinosaur scenes were lifted from the Carnosaur series. Remember the sheriff calling out the raptor in the street like an old west showdown? Its in Raptor. Remember the bobcat vs T-Rex showdown that was the finale of Carnosaur 1? Guess what the grand finale of Raptor is.

I like bad movies. I really do. However, I do have my limits and this movie is among the top three worst, never watch again, list.

The only way I can think of to make this corn-infested colon loaf partially enjoyable would be to grab some beer (large quantities), invite some friends over, get plastered, and roast it MST3K style. Don't forget to flush and wash your hands afterwards.",1439078400,,1277,4.51948051948052

For people who get genuine enjoyment out of the occasional terrible movie, there's always the risk of finding a flick that's just plain bad without crossing the line of ""so bad it's good."" Raptor crosses that line with gusto--using awful and nonsensical stock footage, having a provocatively dressed, porn-star looking forensics expert main character, delivering one-liners that are about as witty as a piece of broccoli, etc--and even throws in some legitimately famous people (as legitimate as you're gonna get for a movie like this) for good measure.

7947655,1,B00005NOOY,"For those who come to RAPTOR after having seen any of the CARNOSAUR trilogy will feel right at home--and that is not a good thing.  RAPTOR is less a film that can stand on its own and more one that is a messy compilation of key scenes from all three.  All of the above deal with JURASSIC PARK themes that relate to cloning dinosaur DNA to recreate such monsters so that in the words of RAPTOR's resident villain Corbin Bernsen they can serve as intelligent aids to humanity or trusted super weapons. It is difficult to repress a smile at the naivete involved in accepting either absurd premise.  Eric Roberts is a sheriff who investigates a series of killings made by some unknown feral animal.  Melissa Brasselle is the busty beauty who persists in walking about in fetching outfits, thus suggesting that she is the real reason why anyone would watch this stinker.  Corbin Bernsen plays a bad guy who blathers continually about how science will benefit regardless of how high the raptors body count reaches. And the real stars are the raptors who look nothing like raptors at all but more like micro T-Rexes manufactured by Mattel.  If one to count the logical flubs and just plain silly plot contrivances, one might begin with the government's decision to send in a team of SWAT soldiers wearing typical fatigues as uniforms.  But then, inexplicably the government sends in a second team as a back up, this time wearing bright red jump suits, only because in one of the original CARNOSAUR versions there was such an orange team sent in and the director forgot to edit out the discrepency.  Camera angles are used which give no sense of size or comparison.  One can almost see the strings holding the raptor puppets up.  The climactic battle between Roberts in an earth moving machine against one of the bigger dinosaurs is taken right from Sigourney Weaver in ALIENS, but in Roberts' case his machine is clearly a shrunken device taken from the set of GODZILLA.  What emerges by the end of RAPTOR is the sinking sensation that one has been snockered into wasting nearly two hours of one's life on sheer stupidity.",1232841600,,2115,4.7046070460704605
