5011482,4,B006OV7ZTS,"NOOMA complete series DVD packs 1-4: The order arrived in excellent condition and well within the expected delivery time. My only disappointment was that only a few of the DVD's included the printed study booklet which is sold with every separate  NOOMA DVD purchased here (Johannesburg South Africa). Most of the DVD's from this order contain a PDF study guide instead of the booklet. The advantage of the PDF study guide is probably that it can be printed and duplicated (e.g. for a small Christian cell groups as we use it in our local congregation). I suppose the PDF instead of the booklet is to discourage people from making photocopies of the booklet? Otherwise I am very satisfied, and I strongly recommend the series for all people asking God-questions (not only Christians). We have grown significantly from watching and discussing the series. Excellent footage, narratives and all-round cinematography. Inette Taylor, St. Giles Presbyterian Church, Johannesburg, South Africa",1388016000,,986,5.280254777070064
5011483,5,B006OV7ZTS,This is an incredible series of DVD's.  We are sharing them with our home group and would like to encourage others to view the series of Rob Bell Nooma DVDs.  ChristianBookUSA was great to work with!,1368748800,3,199,4.5
5011484,5,B006OV7ZTS,I purchased the 24 DVD's for a men's Bible study class which met early each Saturday morning.  We watched one session at the start of each class.  The men really enjoyed the topics.  Each DVD resulted in spirited discussions.  We had some requests to repeat some showings because the men really enjoyed some of the topics.  The attendance went up when we started showing the DVD's because each program had a great moral lesson with lots of examples and great graphics.  I would recommend it for groups of adult men or  women or couples.  The topics would probably bore the youth.,1362182400,6,579,4.663366336633663

8502424,4,B006OV7ZTS,"I'm a Rob Bell fan. His studies are geared to a slightly younger audience, but my adults( wide range of ages) find them interesting.  Not all the DVDs have the study book included. Very disappointed with that",1435363200,,208,4.621621621621622
