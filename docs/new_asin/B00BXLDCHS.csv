8575115,5,B00BXLDCHS,"Great Mani Ratnam movie. No easy-going entertainment, deep insight into different facettes of human behaviour, not always flattering. That's may be why IMDB ratings are mixed.",1432425600,,175,5.769230769230769
8575116,5,B00BXLDCHS,"This is a darn good response to viewer frustration over low quality Tamil movies. Despite mediocre sales the movie turns out good acting, good cast, good locations and cinematography. Mani Ratnam has once again proven his talent as a modern director. The legendary A.R. Rahman has thrown in his music and melody in new twists and directions. The scenes on the high seas were a bit long-winded, something that Tamil movies get carried away with in dramatic scenarios. I give it a full 5 stars.",1394150400,,492,4.8
8575117,5,B00BXLDCHS,"The DVD came quite promptly, and was just as I had hoped.  It is not easy to find good quality South Indian DVDs, with english subtitles at good prices, and good service, so this purchase was a five star for me.  I am happy to have found this seller and will order again from them.",1370304000,2,281,4.090909090909091
