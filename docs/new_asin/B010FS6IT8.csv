7310651,5,B010FS6IT8,This show from the very start to the very finish has been one of the best shows on television.,1442534400,,94,4.0
7310652,5,B010FS6IT8,Great Show as usual and a fitting ending to the series.,1442361600,,55,4.090909090909091

7310654,5,B010FS6IT8,"When this show started I dismissed it as a cheap knock-off of the Swedish version.  By the end of season 4 I am convinced it is one of the best cop shows I've ever seen.  This show really turned it around in season 3 and the main reason I stuck with it was because of the two leads.  I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the performances of Mirielle Enos and Joel Kinnaman  are worthy of The Wire (simply the best example I could think of) and the support cast were often superb.  It also brought interesting issues to the table about the way the system lets kids down and the machinery of the justice system.  I'm sorry to see it finish, but I'm very glad it was around.",1441929600,4,675,4.153846153846154
7310655,4,B010FS6IT8,I was so happy to see that season 4 is finally on dvd.,1441584000,,54,3.230769230769231
7310656,5,B010FS6IT8,"Another thrilling, thought provoking season.  Loved the first three seasons.  Linden and Holder are a perfect team even if they are not perfect themselves.  Can't see why other fans were disappointed.  I'm disappointed that this whole adventure had to end.  Wish they had continued into season five.  Well, I guess there is always hope.  Season four had another chilling story to figure out, the acting throughout was great.  Where do they find all these great young actors?  I'm talking about the young supporting cast.  You'll be biting your nails.  Ending was all I could ask for.  Hurrah for Linden and Holder!",1439251200,4,614,4.97029702970297
7310657,5,B010FS6IT8,"There were a lot of fans who weren't satisfied with the last season of The Killing, but I wasn't one of them. The acting was superb, as always. The chemistry between the two main characters was the driving force of the entire series, and the supporting cast presented a strong front. The tension in this season mounts as Linden and Holder attempt to put their shared crime behind them, and their loyalty is put to the ultimate test when suspicions begin to arise at the department. The only problem I had with this entire season was the way the mystery of the murder of Kyle's family resolved. That was a bit of a disappointment, but as to the conclusion revolving around Linden and Holder, I couldn't have been happier! Perfect ending.",1439078400,7,736,4.625954198473282
7310658,5,B010FS6IT8,"What a non-stop thriller! The atmosphere, the plot and the characters are superb. It's best to watch season 3, as season 4 is a continuation of the previous season.
Both the video and audio were excellent on my blu-ray player, even though these discs are not in the blu-ray format. I was concerned about the audio and video, as many people reported problems. Maybe they are now being created at a higher quality. Both Season 3 and 4 that I bought were of excellent quality.",1486944000,2,473,4.576470588235294

It was so addictive we would think about different scenarios of who the killer could be when we weren't even watching it. During the day we would all of a sudden kick out scenarios to each other.

7310676,4,B010FS6IT8,"No closed captions, subtitles or SDH!  This brilliant series where both lead characters mumble or speak very quietly deserved much better production.  It's not just Amazon's DVD-Rs that lack this--I have the 20th Century Fox set and the same--no acknowledgment of the many protests about this situation since Season 2.  I could understand everything all the other characters said, every word--but missed at least half of the dialogue between the leads.  Which was kind of important!  And watching it was actual work.  People often rent or buy DVDs now just for those subtitles.  Ignoring this need is after so many protests makes no sense.",1469145600,,639,5.086538461538462

7310686,2,B010FS6IT8,"I love the show. What I don't like is that they're charging the same $29 retail price for what is essentially a half season of only 6 episodes totaling 270 minutes (with Season 4 here) while the previous Season 2 (598 minutes) and 3 (528 minutes) had 13 episodes each, and Season 1 had 12 episodes (587 minutes). Plus there's one less disc. Tell me, is this fair to you ???  No, it's just another capitalist gouge. I want to see Season 4, but I will not spend that kind of money just on principal alone. That would be nothing more than feeding into the greed machine. I'll pass for now, and wait until the purchase price is far more reasonable. Until then, there are a ton of other great shows to watch in place of getting financially stung by this last hurrah.",1461974400,2,761,4.321678321678322
7310687,4,B010FS6IT8,"Re: The gentleman who wrote the review blaming 'Fox' for the poor DVD quality; it is my understanding that the DVD is copied/created on-demand by a subsidiary of Amazon.com. That is, the DVD is made on a customer by customer order basis
so I do not understand what Fox has do do with it ?  The customer should have taken his complaint directly to Amazon customer service. Note, I have NOT made a purchase yet but was simply reading the material about the product.",1460160000,,463,4.511904761904762
7310688,4,B010FS6IT8,"++++Warning, this will contain spoilers about the end of season 3, but no major giveaways from season 4++++

As most reading this will know AMC canceled the show for a second and final time after season 3, which left it with a massive cliffhanger with the reveal that Skinner was the pied piper serial killer, and Linden basically executing him.  Netflix revived the show for a 6 episode wrap up which basically contains two parallel storylines.  Holder and Linden's subsequent cover-up of Skinner's murder and then trying to last out the investigation, and a final case to solve involving the murder of the family of a student at a military boarding school.

My main complaint about the season is that the 6 episode run really made things feel rushed.  They had to introduce tension into the Linden-Holder relationship that was not really given enough time to play out and at point felt forced.  They also had to quickly tell and wrap up the case, which is some ways was good in that they could not put in all the ridiculous twists that plagued seasons 2 and to some extent 3.  The standout of the season was Joan Allen, who played the commander of the military academy.  It was clear from episode 1 she played a large part in the case, and she did very well with the material.  The last few minutes of the final episode flashes forward years into the future and ends the series on a satisfying note.  While I do not think the season is perfect, I do think they did as well as they could in the short amount of episodes they were given.

For those who get the discs, they are just MOD discs like seasons 2 and 3.  So you just get the episodes alone, no extras or captions, commentaries etc.  I think people who buy the discs would just be getting it to complete their collection of the series.",1459900800,,1794,4.466257668711656

7310703,2,B010FS6IT8,"Very repetitious and in the modern style wherein all the characters are major failures at life  -  e.g., being substance abusers, unable to establish adult relationships, or having serious mental disabilities  -  and so it's nearly impossible to care what happens to any of them.  The idea of viewing or listening to any art form in order to be engaged, learn from and enjoy the experience is missing from the modern fascination with seeing ""real life"" stories ....  If I want to watch characters like this I would simply have to read the daily papers which adequately describe the horrors than man can inflict on man .

 An added irritant is that there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired.

However,  the actors are excellent as are the production values ...  it's the writing that is a disappointment.",1448928000,,809,4.7898550724637685

7310710,2,B010FS6IT8,"Please keep in mind that this review is to say nothing of the quality of the show itself (which is excellent and kept its final season taut and compelling), but for the quality of product Fox has released here.

This is not the first time that Fox has skimped on the quality of the DVDs for TV seasons it doesn't think will be as popular, and consequently this fourth season set doesn't have commercial grade DVDs but rather purple-disc DVD-Rs. It's as if your neighbor's kid burned the episodes he downloaded online to a couple of DVDs so you could watch them. Fox has been doing this a lot (Don't Trust the B***** in Apartment 23, Bob's Burgers, etc.) for shows it's not convinced have a solid home video demand, and while there are no errors on my set, three out of the four TV seasons burned in this fashion from Fox have had issues and it's entirely a batch to batch issue.

So be warned: the DVD quality is poor and this set is burned in such a way that produces a higher likelihood of errors (whether it's not all the episodes playing or the very primitive menus malfunctioning).

This excellent series deserved better than this. Shame on Fox.",1445299200,27,1150,4.466666666666667

To me there were three stars of the show Mireille Enos, Joel Kinnaman and the grey, rainy, bleak backdrop. It was so strong so pervasive that it was like a character in it's own right. You could almost smell it. The undeniable chemistry and fabulous acting of Enos & Kinnaman was a pleasure to watch. If only this fourth and final season could've been longer than it's six episodes. It packed so much in it what was another riveting season but it did feel things got wrapped up a bit too quickly at the end. The implied get-together of Linden & Holder at the end was nice and endearingly drawn out. Thank you to everyone involved in what was a fantastic show on par with or in my opinion better than The Wire.",1444176000,,871,4.253012048192771
