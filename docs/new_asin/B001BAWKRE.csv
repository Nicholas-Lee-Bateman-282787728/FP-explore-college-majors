3487901,5,B001BAWKRE,"This TV movie is so much more than the made-for-tv holiday fluff that one often finds the networks cranking out each December.  Snow is charming and loveable, with great characters and a winning role by the always-wonderful Tom Cavanagh.  I watched it twice last year and am so thrilled that ABC Family decided to release the DVD.  This is certainly a new holiday classic in my house!",1225929600,24,384,4.701492537313433

3487916,5,B001BAWKRE,"Nick Snowden is the new Santa, taking over from his Dad from a long line of Santa's.  It's the family business and he can't let them down.  He's not so sure of himself and he doesn't even have any elves to help him in this, his first year as Santa.  Not only that, one of his reindeer has gone missing.

But Nick will get help out there in the real world as he goes looking for his missing reindeer.  His first helper will be young, precocious Hector, who is very funny and very helpful, under the right conditions.  But can the two of them get Sandy to help?

A very different look at Santa -- and fun for the whole family!",1423526400,,624,4.107438016528926

3487921,3,B001BAWKRE,"Cute little Christmas movie for the family.  Not great, but entertaining family fare.  A goofy little silliness movie.  Tom Cavanagh plays a different Santa.  Tall and slender, with no elves, but a magic bag in which he puts one of each type of toy in and it never goes empty.  He travels through mirrors to get around quickly.  Buddy, his new reindeer in training has gotten loose and is captured by a hunter who sells him to a zoo in California.  When he finds out that Buddy can fly he steals him back to sell him to a hunter to shoot him.  With the aid of a cute zoo worker Santa has to get Buddy back, train him to fly and all by Christmas eve.",1418342400,,649,4.136

Nick does ask Sandy a qustion about the future.  Watch this movie to see what happens to Nick and Sandy. IS NICK AND SANDY ABLE TO BRING BUDDY BACK TO THE NORTH POLE?  (Word of warning). This movie does have some strange thing going on.  IF YOU LIKE STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING IN CHRISTMAS MOVIES THIS MOVIE IS UP YOUR
 ALLY.  WATCH IT BEFORE YOU JUDGE IT!",1356134400,,964,4.254143646408839

3487938,3,B001BAWKRE,"This is a cute premise - the latest Santa (it is an inherited family position in this film) loses one of his reindeers, who it turns out has been stolen and taken to a small California zoo. The young (and slim) Santa has to travel there to retrieve him. He travels through mirrors, but other than that, this is a very tame Santa. There aren't any elves, or North Pole fanciness (most of the movie takes place in California) and we only get to see the reindeer fly at the very end - which is fun, but wasn't enough to keep my kids engaged. Before this point, most of the movie is talk, and romantic intrigue between Santa and the woman who runs the zoo, and attempts by a big-game hunter to steal the reindeer for a hunt. My kids are 5 & 7, and I had to explain a lot of the plot points to them - the whole game hunter thing, and the romantic intrigue stuff, was a bit over their head. They liked the reindeer flying, but other than that kept losing interest. So overall, it's an OK family film if you are looking for something to watch that is Christmas-themed, but it's not great.",1324425600,,1081,4.201923076923077
3487939,5,B001BAWKRE,"Just enough magic, and the lead character have lots of charisma.  This is a sweet movie, with the predictable villain, but if you like your holiday movies with happy endings and a little comedy ... this one fits the bill.  Whereas, I often think the supporting cast can make or break a movie, I don't think that's the case here.  The attraction is to the two romantic leads and the chemistry they have - and quite good acting skills, for my two cents.  Am a holiday movie lover, but they have to be ""feel good"" for me to enjoy the season.  So, if you're the same, try this one out.",1320192000,4,581,4.245454545454545
3487940,5,B001BAWKRE,"This is my daughter's favorite Christmas movie. She watches it on T.V. every year, and could never find it on a DVD. Now she can watch it commercial free!!! She loves it!!! Mom's the BEST again!",1294099200,3,194,4.416666666666667
3487941,5,B001BAWKRE,"This movie is truly refreshing.  If you are tired of the now-standard fare of childishly bickering adults who somehow fall in love despite starting out at odds with each other, give this movie a try. It isn't deep, but the characters are good people -warm hearted, unselfish.  They smile a lot.  The ""bad guy"" isn't over the top.  The romance between the main characters is clean and marked by respect.  After wading through far too many holiday duds, this one shines.",1292803200,4,468,4.728395061728395
3487942,5,B001BAWKRE,"The movie arrived brand new and in excellent condition!  It was a little slow in arriving, but I'm attributing that to Christmas postal service.  Thanks for a great movie!",1265846400,,171,4.862068965517241

Tom Cavanagh, a goofy Santa going under the alias Nick Snowden, lost his reindeer. This leads him on a journey to meet Ashley Williams, a cheerful manager at a local zoo. Granted, the acting and the characters are all too good to be true. This may not necessarily become a Christmas classic. However, the mix of cast and characters produces some funny scenes. Particularly Hector, the 8-year-old kid who becomes Santa's sidekick. Sometimes he seems more world-wise than anybody else in the film.",1260662400,7,934,7.577981651376147

3487946,3,B001BAWKRE,"This was a very cute movie.  Granted, it is the basic ""oh no...Christmas is in trouble"" syndrome, but they do a good job at keeping it simple and fun.  I wasn't too keen on the fact that they eliminated the elves from the workshop-perhaps the studio didn't want to pay for a bunch of short people- But it was still a fun movie to watch.  I would recommend this movie for parents and kids alike.",1230422400,4,394,4.226666666666667

Nick is not your tradiational Santa in any sense of the word.  There is also no elf or Tim Allen-esque Santa in sight.  This is the kind of movie that warms your heart and makes you believe that Santa is out there and everything will work out in the end.",1230249600,6,357,3.9305555555555554
