Usually the plot is a love story and he bumps into or meets a groovy babe and then they hit it off and then have a big fight and argue then break up but then realize that they dig each other. Usually a romantic comedy with some drama in between. Although I couldn't understand much I watched this movie anyway and tried to look at their actions and such. This movie I was told translates to ""paying for their love"". So in this case kinda like a escort but the male being the escort who takes out women then get paid by the women for chilling with them and saying mushy words that they want to hear but probably don't mean it. They just want bank. The dudes only dig paper and don't really mean what they say. This movie has a different plot to it then other Aga movies I watched. Aga looks like he's a dance instructor and he meets and teaches a woman how to dance. The woman goes through some tough times and her friend takes her out where she meets Aga. He teaches her how to dance and they start digging each other. But this movie is more of a dramatic suspenseful one with major domestics. This is the first Aga movie to have guns in them for me. So this movie has action, love, suspense, violence, and backstabbing behind each others back. More of a serious movie. One of my favorite Aga movies would be When Loves Begins. This movie takes place in boracay. Beautiful scenery and the basic love story movies that Aga stars in. This movie was kinda intense for me but Aga does a good job dancing. I didn't know he could groove. I notice that Aga movies are getting high in price now. I guess they only made so much and they are hard to obtain. I look on ebay and there aren't much Aga movies and if there is some they are most likely from a foreign country. I guess his movies were hardly shipped out and were made to stay in the Philippines. The quality of his DVDs are kinda grainy and not super clear. I guess they use cheap cameras or old cameras from the 1980s. Aga always gets the good dames!
