5165100,2,B008HHTFLS,Just interviews with people close to the Beatles..a little boring to say the least. The artwork of the boxcover however is probably the best feature aspect of the item. I have to admit a clever way to deceive people into buying it.,1384214400,48,231,4.523809523809524
5165101,3,B008HHTFLS,"These DVDS -- a collection of five previously released DVDs available separately -- are really for Beatles geeks and not casual fans. They are all travelogues with tours of places -- Liverpool, Hamburg, Merseyside and London -- associated with the Beatles and New York sites for John Lennon. Your level of enjoyment will depend on how much you love Beatles trivia -- and we're talking deep deep stuff here. For some it'll be great, others will find it boring. The most enjoyable are the sites in Liverpool, London and Merseyside, with Hamburg next and New York last. Most of the hosts are very knowledgeable, including Beatles author Spencer Leigh and Richard Porter, who conducts Beatles walking tours in London. If you never will get to these places, these discs are good to see. Visiting them in person, though, is more fun than watching a tour on DVD.",1383782400,21,855,4.8231292517006805
5165102,4,B008HHTFLS,I received the DVD set very quickly but the case had some slight damage which is probably why the price was so low. I haven't had a chance to watch the dvd's yet but they look fine just the outside cover was ripped.,1383177600,,215,4.023255813953488

If you're as big a fan as I am, you'll enjoy this 5 dvd set. Discover their hometown of Liverpool including the boy's childhood homes as well as the famous Mersey river area where the Merseyside sound was born, visit Hamburg, Germany where they honed their act in the early years, follow them to London, the city where they recorded those great albums and finally a tour of New York where John Lennon settled and lived out his days. This makes a nice addition any Beatle fan's collection.",1353110400,5,605,4.45945945945946

5165115,1,B008HHTFLS,Wasted my time and money!  It is merely a few people's opinion and interview/discussions.  ZERO new information or anything worth watching.  I am a BIG Beatles fan that goes back to the early 60's.  I think I've got a copy of everything released.  But this is at the bottom... call it garbage.,1395100800,22,293,4.5576923076923075

5165117,1,B008HHTFLS,"I am a 61 year old avid Beatles fan. I was truly disappointed. It was great to see Paul and Ringo together. The so called "" stars"" they had singing the Beatles songs were terrible. Johnny Depp and Sean Penn? Give me a break. It sounded like they had trouble speaking English. Last but not least, Yoko Ono dancing in the aisle with her sun glasses on? She looked like an idiot",1391990400,27,375,4.222222222222222

8528178,2,B008HHTFLS,"Old second hand DVDs.  The best thing about this collection is the box it came in.  Will dispose of the worthless videos and use the box for beatles Cds.  Sorry, only being truthful.  Very disappointed in this collection.",1492905600,,221,4.7368421052631575

8528184,1,B008HHTFLS,This DVD collection has absolutely no footage of the Beatles.  It is a total RIP-OFF!!. I bought it a year ago and didn't have time to watch it until very recently. After going through 3 dvds and NO Beatles I was furious!! Now it's too late to return so hoping to save anyone else from the same disappointment.  All it contains is some bozo visiting all the famous places the Beatles played and lived and talked to people who knew them then.  Such a total disappointment. You should be ashamed for selling it!,1427587200,13,509,4.451612903225806
8528185,4,B008HHTFLS,"If your looking for concert footage or interviews with the actual band members, look further. If your looking for the Grammy awards show or tribute performances again look further. This is travelogue of the Beatles, their childhood homes, places that shaped them and their music, etc. after visiting London and participating in the Rock and Roll walking tour, and Liverpools Magically Mystery Tour, this is a great souvenir of our vacation.",1415664000,9,440,5.211267605633803
