5528862,5,B00AZ43C4M,"Josh Aronson skillfully brings to light a story that few have heard about: how the Israel Philharmonic came to be and how in its creation the musical legacy of European Jews was kept alive through the catastrophe of the Holocaust.

""Orchestra of Exiles"" is an optimistic work in the same vein as Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and shows the power of visionary individuals to do good in the face of evil. The Oskar Schindler of this story is Bronislav Huberman, a gifted violinist of the early 20th century who had the foresight to anticipate the fate that was awaiting European Jews during World War II. Huberman's plan to save the musical legacy of Jews in Europe by creating an orchestra in Israel (at the time Palestine) was brilliant yet quixotic. The story of how he energetically brought his dream into fruition and in the process saved hundreds of lives is enthralling.

If you're in the mood to see an optimistic movie about the power of the human spirit, I highly recommend this work. Or if you're a history buff, you'll also enjoy the story. Classical music aficionados will delight in the excellent soundtrack featuring recordings by Huberman, the Israel Philharmonic, Joshua Bell and others.

All in all, I give my highest recommendation.",1368403200,6,1250,4.914691943127962

5528865,5,B00AZ43C4M,"When I finished watching this documentary the first time, I immediately restarted and watched it again, I liked it that much!

""Orchestra of Exiles"" combines beautiful classical music background and a riveting true story told through archive films, interviews, and re-enactments.

This documentary film tells the story of great Polish violist Brawnislaw Huberman who in 1935 created Palestine Symphony Orchestra from the greatest Jewish musicians from Germany and Eastern Europe.  It was clear to Huberman that all these people would be exterminated. By providing them a legal way to emigrate from their countries he saved them from Hitler and a certain death.  Between 1935 and 1939 he saved almost 1000 Jews.  He knew his selections were not just selections of musicians, he was a judge of who is going to live and who is going to die.

Huberman invited Toscanini, who at the time was a giant figure in music at the time, to be the first conductor of the orchestra.  The story of how Toscanini interacted with the orchestra when they did not speak the same language was amusing and enlightening. The orchestra was a tremendous success, not only because it brought together great musicians but because it brought peoples a feeling of victory over evil.

The documentary traces the lives of some of the musicians, their children, and grandchildren. It contains interviews, photos, movie clips, as well as re-enactments. Beautiful music is played through out this documentary.

It is a compelling story, which makes you feel proud of the human spirit and the power of music to unite people.

I am grateful to First Run Features for providing me a review copy of this DVD.

5528866,5,B00AZ43C4M,"""Orchestra of Exiles"" is an illuminating documentary that chronicles the origins of the world-renowned Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra. The IPO owes its existence to the steely determination and resourcefulness of violinist Bronislaw Huberman (1882-1947).

The documentary provides insights into Huberman's life and personality. A child prodigy, Huberman had a strict father who saw his son's prodigious talent for playing the violin as a means to lift the family's financial prospects. Later, after his father's death, Huberman continued playing at concerts around the world, but even a marriage and a child could not provide him with the content and peace he was seeking. His first love would always be the violin, and when Huberman saw the anti-Semitism that was spreading rapidly across Europe with the advent of Nazism, he found a new mission in life - that of forming his very own orchestra in the land of Palestine, the seeds of which would yield the IPO. Huberman spent many years throughout the 1930s scouring Europe for talented Jewish musicians to form his orchestra.

The documentary does an excellent job piecing together various events through interviews with contemporary Israeli musicians, an interview with Joshua Bell, family members of the original orchestra who are grateful for having been spared the horrors of the Holocaust thanks to Huberman, historians, and archival footage.

It was interesting to learn that the renowned Italian conductor, Arturo Toscanini was a fervent anti-Nazi who refused the Fuhrer's persuasive invitation to come to Berlin and conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Toscanini and Huberman are shown to have formed a positive working relationship which resulted in Toscanini coming to Palestine and conducting the inaugural performance of the IPO, which turned out to be a great success.

The narrative throughout this documentary is engaging and provided me a lot of background information on the political climate in Germany and Europe during the 1930s, and of how Huberman had to call upon every available resource to get the Jewish musicians out of Europe. When Huberman was in need of  extra funds, he called upon renowned scientist and fellow Jew, Albert Einstein, to help out and a fundraiser in New York helped immensely.

With the help of friends and sympathetic acquaintances, Huberman saved almost 1,000 Jews. It was not only the musicians that were saved but also their family members and more. In the larger scheme of things, it may seem a small number, but in the horror that was the Holocaust, every life saved was a miracle in and of itself, and Huberman's selfless efforts are certainly to be commended.

Viewers also gain insight into Huberman's thoughts and feelings. He struggled with the knowledge that he had the power to grant life/freedom to whoever he chose for his orchestra at the expense of others who were not as lucky. Only the brightest and most talented were picked, and Huberman was conflicted about those that were left behind.

This quality production will appeal to anyone with an interest in Jewish cultural history, the Holocaust, and the IPO.

Thanks to First Run Features for this screener.

The DVD running time is 85 minutes, in color, and the set-up has the option of 5.1 Surround or 2.0 Stereo.

5528867,5,B00AZ43C4M,"Josh Aronson  wrote, directed and produced this masterpiece.  He did a great job of  inter-twining archival footage, photographs,  music  with some current re-creations  of historical events and commentaries  by some well-known luminaries (Zubin Mehta, Joshua Bell, Pinchas Zuckerman, Itzhak Perlman) and many other individuals who were involved with the fascinating story.  Josh Aronson spoke at the screening that I saw and  he gave many interesting comments  in the Q and A.  The video is well worth watching and Aronson's  appearance was an added bonus.  My only regret is that the documentary was not longer.

5528868,4,B00AZ43C4M,"I recently saw this movie at the 2013 Jewish and Israeli Film Festival here in Cincinnati. Of all the movies being shown at this year's festival, I had looked forward to seeing this one more than any other, due to my love for/interest in classical music, and this movie surely did not disappoint.

""Orchestra of Exiles"" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the story of how Polish violinist Bronislaw Huberman, a one-time child prodigy, watched shortly after Hilter came to power in 1933 and Jewish musicians were being fired from classical orchestras. Huberman decided that he would create and build a new orchestra from the ground up in Palestine (at that time under the British mandate). Of course this was easier said than done, and Huberman encountered multiple setbacks, including the problem of getting visas for the musicians he was trying to recruite to Palestine. I am not spoiling any plot points when I tell you that eventually Huberman succeeds, as the Palestine Symphony gave its first performance in December, 1936. (When Israel gained independence in 1948, the orchestra was renamed the Israeli Philharomic Orchestra, which remains to this day a world class orchestra.)

Several comments: first and foremost, if you don't like or care for classical music, save yourself the trouble. This documentary is eye and ear-candy for classical music fans, primarly because of the at times jaw-dropping historical film footage that director Josh Aronson was able to dig up from the 1930s. Then there are the many commentaries and historical perspectives from people like Itzhak Perlman, Joshua Bell, Zubin Mehta and Pinchas Zukerman, just to name those. This movie is also important in context of the Jewish and Israeli history, as the successful start of the Palestine Symphony amounted to a raised middle finger to Hitler and attested to the determination and persistance of the Jewish musicians who came together to create the Palestine Symphony. Kudos to writer-director Josh Asonson for bringing us this important yet also very enjoyable and entertaining documentary. ""Orchestra of Exiles"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1361059200,55,2117,5.241887905604719

5528902,5,B00AZ43C4M,"This documentary is impressive on many levels.  Bronislaw Huberman was a Polish Jewish violinist residing in Germany when the Nazis came to power.  In the mid-thirties, he emigrated to Palestine and started what became the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.  He convinced the Jewish Authority and the British to allow 70 musicians and their families to immigrate to Palestine, from Europe, to play in his orchestra; in all, he saved about 1,000 Jewish people.
Interestingly enough, the first conductor of the orchestra, at it's first concert on December 26, 1936, was Arturo Toscanini, who, although an anti-Fascist, was not Jewish.  Toscanini remained the conductor for a few years.

5528906,4,B00AZ43C4M,"There is no question that ORCHESTRA OF EXILES is an important film. It is beautifully made with enviable technical finesse, always a necessity when classical music features in the soundtrack. Writer/ producer/ director Josh Aronson clearly had a vision and a passion for making this film and the results are highly satisfying, highly recommended.

For this reviewer, however, there is another element that the film neglects and while it is perhaps unfair to impose this perspective, it is worth mentioning, perhaps as inspiration for another, related film.

First, why is it that Bronislaw Huberman is so little-known today? Thankfully, this film will go some considerable way to right that wrong. Huberman was a sort of musical Oskar Schindler and it simply isn't right that his work has not been recognized as it should. Especially in light of the fact todays Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra is the direct legacy of Hubermans work and risk.

Second, the Jewish Hubermans mission and accomplishment stand in stark contrast to someone like Yehudi Menuhin who, as a similarly-lauded Jewish child prodigy of the violin (like Huberman) gave the impression that his shared heritage with the millions of European Jews during the Holocaust was not something to be overly concerned about. In fact, Menuhin was later accused of being a Nazi sympathizer when he stood up to support Wilhelm Furtwangler, the war time conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.

One might interject: but this is not a film about Yehudi Menuhin. No, it isnt. I leave that to the great documentarian Tony Palmer, whose film (and book) about Menuhin explore why this great child genius of the violin did not fulfill, in adulthood, his musical potential. The answer, at least in part, lies in the fact that he (Menuhin) appeared to close himself off to the suffering of the Jews at this turbulent time in world history. Huberman did not.

Ironically, Huberman, whose playing is still regarded today as legendary, is nearly forgotten. Menuhin, whose playing is rarely cited as among the musical greats of the 20th-Century, is still remembered, albeit as much for his service to music in general (establishing music festivals, for example) than his playing which, it is generally agreed, declined as he grew into adulthood.

ORCHESTRA OF EXILES is simply a different film than this comparison might have made it. And while the extra features include some important themes that are not found in the main film itself, the Huberman/Menuhin dichotomy is not mentioned. Is this a missed opportunity to ruminate on another aspect of the injustice of artistic persecution?

Ultimately, Bronislaw Hubermans compassion and love for humanity influenced and enhanced his musical genius. Despite not being as well-known as he deserves to be, perhaps this is enough. And if Hubermans legacy lives and thrives in the artistry of the Israeli Philharmonic, as it most surely does, everything else  including ORCHESTRA OF EXILES  is a welcome bonus.",1397433600,,2992,5.178053830227744

5528916,5,B00AZ43C4M,"Josh Aronson's ""Orchestra of Exiles"" is an entertaining and informative tribute to a remarkable man.  Bronislaw Huberman, born in Poland in 1882, was a child prodigy who played the violin magnificently.  He is revered today, not solely for his prodigious musical talent, but also for his humanity, compassion, and political shrewdness.  He was a visionary who, in the early 1930s, saw the handwriting on the wall in Europe. He believed that Adolf Hitler was not merely an upstart, but rather an uncompromising and dangerous fanatic who would not leave the world stage of his own volition. Huberman spoke out forcefully against Nazism and devoted his life to saving approximately one thousand European Jews from almost certain death.  Some of these men and women became the first members of the Palestine Symphony Orchestra, which was later renamed the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.

Aronson hired actors to reenact brief scenes in this documentary (although he claims to disliking reenactments, which he admits in an interview are often cheesy.)  These are the least effective moments in an otherwise touching and inspiring film that is enlivened by period footage, arresting photographs, and entertaining commentary by such luminaries as Pinchas Zuckerman, Itzhak Perlman, Zubin Mehta, and Leon Botstein.  These and other individuals intelligently and insightfully discuss the power of music to unite us, the historical and cultural importance of Huberman's accomplishments, and the ways in which the Palestine Symphony Orchestra enriched the country and preserved the Western European musical tradition.

""Orchestra of Exiles"" gives credit to those who assited Huberman in his quest:  Albert Einstein helped raise much needed funds; Chaim Weizmann exerted his considerable influence to obtain residency certificates for the new immigrants; and the great Arturo Toscanini agreed to conduct the inaugural concert of the Palestine Symphony Orchestra.  When the maestro started screaming at the musicians, they smiled, delighted that this taskmaster expected nothing less than excellence from them.  For those of us who had never heard of Huberman, this film is a revelation--proof that one man who sets out to attain a seemingly impossible but worthy goal can overcome enormous obstacles.  It was by no means certain that Jews would want to leave their countries of birth to live in a barren land.  In addition, Huberman was also justifiably concerned about the riots in the streets of Palestine, intransigent British officials, and David Ben Gurion's reluctance to grant precious permanent residency certificates to musicians.  In spite of it all, Bronislaw Huberman lived to see his dream become a glorious reality.",1383436800,2,2717,5.4844124700239805

5528918,5,B00AZ43C4M,"If you think you have seen and heard every story of the Holocaust, you must see this documentary.  Bronislaw Huberman is a true hero of the Holocaust and to see how this plays out makes this a documentary you will return to over and over again.  This spans the interest level of the classical music lover who wants to find out about this conductor and the historian who wants to learn about people who just didn't sit by and let the Holocaust happen.  Huberman worked a miracle and in the process he used music to save many Jews.  You must get this documentary and you must share this with as many people as possible.  The story is unforgettable!",1378080000,,646,4.440677966101695

5528924,5,B00AZ43C4M,"Faced with something like the rise of Facism,  would I be able to see the writing on the wall and make a break for it.?

5528925,5,B00AZ43C4M,"A man and a story I was completely unfamiliar with forms the basis for this compelling documentary. Violinist Bronislaw Huberman, a prodigy with much acclaim and talent, saw the coming of the Nazi threat in Europe for what it was, and through his hard work managed to get a thousand Jews out of Europe and into Palestine, forming from those ranks what would eventually become the Israel Philharmonic. In doing so, he saved their lives and much of the cultural legacy of Europe. Every life saved in the Holocaust was something of a miracle, even if it could never be enough, and the story completely drew me in, examining the events in a thorough way, mixing in commentary from descendants and musicians- some of whom are very well known. There's a tremendous amount of classical music woven into the soundtrack. This is required viewing for anyone with an interest in the Holocaust, the Second World War, or just classical music as a whole. Highly recommended.",1369699200,,960,4.824242424242424
5528926,5,B00AZ43C4M,"everyone has heard of Schindler!!! But Huberman??? what a simple but ingenious way to ""save"" elite musicians. And what a burden he must have faced literally deciding who would live and who would die. We will view this during one of our monthly summer movie sessions. We plan to watch not only old favorites but also foreign films and films which will provoke us to thought.",1369612800,,373,4.666666666666667
5528927,5,B00AZ43C4M,"A compelling, well-done documentary depicting the life of Huberman.  Another testimony to one of the ""Righteous Among Us""-those who were not complicit-those who, despite a personal toll, were relentless in their vision, in their unwillingness to ignore, in their horror at the ""barbarism"" of Naziism.  The inclusion of Joshua Bell-and his role in Huberman's legacy (just watch the movie)- is particularly moving.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1369526400,3,432,5.71875
5528928,5,B00AZ43C4M,This is a fantastic story about the origin of the now famous Israel Philarmonic Orchestra. Thanks to this documentary I learned a lot about the personality of Bronislaw Huberman.

8559428,5,B00AZ43C4M,"Thrilling re-telling of the power of one man to resurrect the musical  assets of Eastern Europe and establish an orchestra in Palestine. The music alone is worth watching this documentary.  It is hard to imagine how a single individual can selflessly bring egotistical musicians together without the benefit of financing, remuneration or personal reward.  I have watched this twice and would certainly watch again.  Perhaps his greatest historical achievement would be the establishment of schools to foster musical education.",1484179200,,526,5.620253164556962
