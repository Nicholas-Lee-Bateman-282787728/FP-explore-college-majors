8683859,5,B00OJ0WTBK,Best movie ever made about Bigfoot.  Decisively debunks any speculation that bigfoot is an alien.  I won't be going in any caves soon lol.,1436918400,,138,4.708333333333333
8683860,1,B00OJ0WTBK,"This is a huge waste of time. They should have called it, (Everything You've Ever Wanted To Know About Bigfoot But Were Too Smart To Ask).

This boring Mockumentary Is all over the place but no where anyone would want to go. The visuals are lacking as is everything else .The recreated Stories of ""what if"" were tiresome and ridiculous .

They try and sell us on all these theories like Bigfoot is an alien etc. It's actually painful to watch.",1426204800,,443,4.45679012345679
8683861,1,B00OJ0WTBK,"This is nothing but a narration, by one man, who shares his views. A lot of the time on the dvd is filled with stuff that has nothing to do with bigfoot: the pyramids, stone henge, Robin Hood (lots about him), Merlin, Puck, and trolls. There are no mentions of modern sitings nor interviews with anyone. He just talks about folklore and legends. Most of the background is nothing but art work with special effects thrown in or words and sentences flashing up on the screen for you to read. I was so disappointed and it upset me so much that I only got about 3/4 of the way through the dvd when I had to turn it off.  Personally, I am throwing it in the trash.  Again, save your money, this is nothing like what you would expect it to be.",1422403200,6,737,4.183098591549296
