4330884,5,B004CZRE44,"Our family checked out this movie at our local library many years ago.  We loved it!  In fact, it has become a favorite of mine.  Some might call it a ""chic flick,"" which it is, but for those who haven't seen it is truly a wonderful love story.  Grace Kelly shines as the princess who is very educated, classy and graceful.  She is unknowingly loved by the professor who is the teacher of her two younger brothers.  The way he looks into her eyes during the ball is a way that every woman wants to be looked at by her husband; an unforgettable scene and one that matches this movie on the scale of the way Richard Gere kisses the leading lady in FIRST KNIGHT. In the SWAN, it is not a kiss but a look.  But that look could stay in your heart forever. Agnes Moorehead plays the Queen and does a great job.  The whole movie is a delight!",1285632000,,835,4.142857142857143
4330885,4,B004CZRE44,"The Swan is Grace Kelly at her loveliest.  That alone makes the film worth viewing for her fans.  The story is a bit silly and out of another time,  but what makes this video entertaining are the many excellent performances by
Kelly and others in the cast.  Brain Ahern's performance, alone, as the monastic, world-wise uncle is worth the price of the DVD.  Louis Jourdan as the brilliant but peasant tutor who falls in love with Princess Alexandra (Kelly) also gives a splendid and passionate performance.  Alec Guiness is himself, which is the role he ususally plays, but in The Swan his aristocratic, snobbish, slightly wodden character works.  So all in all, this is a DVD for pure escape to an earlier and simpler time.  It's an inside-out Cinderella story with all the whimsey and unreality one should expect in this mythical kingdom.  Finally, the film was shot at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina, and the setting alone is a delight, especially for those who have actually visited.",1269561600,6,994,4.834319526627219
4330886,2,B004CZRE44,The quality of this film was pretty poor and i was pretty disappointed with it.,1266105600,,79,4.333333333333333
4330887,5,B004CZRE44,"A timeless classic! I had heard about this movie from my Mother, who watched it just once when she was a young girl. I gave it to her as this year's Christmas present, and she was thrilled to see it again after 45 years. We watched it together, and I was captivated by its beauty, too. The screenplay, based on Ferenc Molnar's play of the same title, is brilliant, subtle and heartbreaking. The casting couldn't have been chosen better: the gorgeous Grace Kelly, the witty Alec Guinness and Louis Jourdan's intensity and earnestness make it a truly splendid movie, and I'm surprised it is so little-known today. It certainly deserves better recognition. An absolute must for anybody who has a soft spot for romantic stories and who appreciates a meaningful, solidly built dialogue.
(On a technical level, I was satisfied by the good quality of the product: no regrets or complaints at all.)",1261958400,24,890,4.823529411764706
4330888,5,B004CZRE44,"One of my favorite films, THE SWAN features an all-star cast: Grace Kelly (her last role before assuming the role as a real princess!), Alec Guinness, Louis Jordan, Agnes Morehead, Leo G. Carroll, Brian Aherne, and Estelle Winwood. Well-scripted and beautifully shot, THE SWAN  rises above the level of other 1950s costumers. Guinness brings both humor and wisdom to his portrayal of Prince Albert, and Kelly is suitably ""cold"" as Princess Alexandra. Agnes Morehead and Estelle Winwood steal scenes with their hilarious lines and bluff and bluster.

One note: my copy was actually in the PAL format and played just fine on my ""all regions"" DVD player, but you might want to be certain about the format. (All regions DVD players can be had fairly easily; I acquired one via online shopping from Illinois for about $65-$70).

Highly recommended. Hopefully an NTSC edition will emerge soon.",1259798400,11,887,5.061643835616438

4330890,4,B004CZRE44,"My product came within the time alloted from Canada. I enjoyed the movie purchased sight unseen because I love Grace Kelly and it is filmed at the Biltmore House which I loved going to years ago. If you like old movies this is pretty good, but I think more women would like it than men.",1250208000,,286,4.218181818181818
4330893,5,B004CZRE44,"This movie has always meant a lot to me from a young age. It's a beautifully told story, balancing grief with exquisitely funny humor, and has a wonderful cast-- Alec Guinness is a joy to watch, and you can't help rooting for him to get the princess in spite of his awkwardness. The movie is a solid story from beginning to end, but the ending lines about the swan are enough to make it worth watching. Very powerful.",1473897600,,417,4.358974358974359

4330896,4,B004CZRE44,"I had seen and heard mixed reviews about this film, but after watching it I must own a copy. The setting at the elegant Biltmore Mansion in Asheville, NC is always wonderful to see. Grace Kelly is more reserved in this role than in the wonderful High Society. Estelle Winwood as the aged aunt steals every scene she appears in. Louis Jourdan is charming, which makes the ending all the more poignant. Alec Guinness is in my opinion perfect as the wooing prince. Agnes Moorhead as the queen is delightful. The script sizzles with wit. I gave it only four stars because of the pragmatic ending.",1444348800,,592,4.59433962264151
4330897,5,B004CZRE44,"Superb performances by Grace Kelly and Louis Jourdan!  I feel the description ""Romantic Comedy"" doesn't do justice to the heartache portrayed by Kelly & Jordan, who fall in love and have to let one another go.",1443139200,,209,4.805555555555555

Alec, be aware that his role is quite limited. I gave The Swan only four stars because it seemed overly long for such a simple plot (though the running time is given as only 108 minutes), and because I got bored with the sentimental love scenes between Grace Kelly and Louis Jourdan, but I admit I've never cared for the merciless typecasting Mr. Jourdan has had to endure.",1427932800,,545,4.515151515151516

4330937,4,B004CZRE44,"Beautiful movie.  Grace Kelly looks VERY regal with her hairdo and gowns.  Grace is perfectly cast as Princess Alexandra, a shy young woman who is being considered to marry her cousin, Albert (actor Alec Guinness), the heir to the throne.  Albert just doesn't seem to win Grace's affections when he arrives at the palace with his sleeping-in while the rest of them are patiently waiting to dine with him as well as his interest in playing with Alexandra's younger brothers.

Actress Estelle Winwood plays one of Alexandra's relatives, Symphorosa, and she also guest starred on one of my all-time favorite 1960s classic TV shows entitled ""Bewitched"" as one of Samantha's (actress Elizabeth Montgomery) aunts in the earlier seasons.  She is very comically funny in this as well as actress Agnes Moorehead who plays Queen Maria + Albert's mother (and who played Endora, Samantha's mother, on ""Bewitched"" also).  Unfortunately, Queen Maria's character isn't featured until towards the end of the movie and she's absolutely brilliant in this.  She has great comic timing.  It's a shame they didn't use her character more.  If you're also a fan of the TV show ""Bewitched"" then this movie is a must-see for these two actresses.

Actor Louis Jourdan plays the tutor in this movie, who is able to win Alexandra's affections after she uses him to try to make Albert jealous per her mother's request.  I'm also a huge fan of the Doris Day movie ""Julie"" which was also released around the time of this movie.  In ""Julie"" Louis Jordan plays an obsessive controlling husband so it's nice to see him play a romantic role in this film.  He's also very-well cast in this film.

I won't give away the whole plot of the movie, as I'm sure other reviewers have done so and you may not want to know.  I will say that it's one of my favorite Grace Kelly movies and it's a very beautiful movie.",1407801600,2,1871,4.74922600619195

4330940,3,B004CZRE44,"Grace Kelly's character is one of the most boring, dull roles ever, and she was dull and boring as called for. I got sick of listening to her stilted, tense, unhappy look and speeches. But that was her persona in other films too, just more exaggerated here. She fulfilled her 1950s female upper class role. But in other films she at least had some glamour and personality. The film itself was fairly interesting, but the affected dialogue and stilted characters got to be tiresome.  The script was so so so....clever and affected.",1406678400,,530,4.760869565217392
4330941,1,B004CZRE44,"Have tried two different disks:  both are fatally flawed (video stops/starts/goes 'boxy'; audio is missing) right at the critical point in the plot/story. Seems like it is a flawed production line.  Most of the movie functions perfectly -- except for a few minutes at the critical point.  VERY disappointing.
The story itself is a sad commentary on the degeneration of monarchies, and the whole social caste system.  It is well acted and the costuming is beautiful.",1405123200,,465,5.078947368421052

4330944,4,B004CZRE44,"This is an often overlooked gem. Based on a play by Hungarian playwrite Ferenc Molnar it takes place in a fictitious kingdom where the a  family with rolay relations  is bent on marriage for the only eligible daughter.
Glace Kelly is the beautiful Swan, a princess just coming into adulthood, learning about romantic love.
Sir Alec Guiness (as a young actor, not Obi Wan Kanobi) is the distant cousin, the hoped for suitor. Louis Jordan plays the tutod in love with the pricess.
It is a delightful story in which all the actors are exceptional from the minor to the major ones. Romance and humour and touching revelations make it a great movie to watch.",1392595200,,653,4.6695652173913045

4330959,1,B004CZRE44,My friends and I enjoyed it every bit as much as the original many years ago. I did have some difficulty with being able to increase the volume but it was acceptable at the maximum volume. It was a beautiful movie and certainly enhanced with the remastering. I also bought a copy for my sister because it is a movie that brings back wonderful memories. I would think it would have appeal as a good family movie that parents and grandparents could share with their children. It is great that we can enjoy the old movies all over again.,1373414400,,534,4.404040404040404

4330970,5,B004CZRE44,"This movie was made in 1956 and was her last film. It was also the first US film by Alec Guinness, who played the prince. Wikipedia says it was offered to other actors but I think he is terrific in the role. The story is about a family, formerly royal, residing in a small middle eastern country in the period before World War I. It reminds me very much of the Prisoner of Zenda, a novel and movie about a similar country in that period. It is sort of sad to think that the characters will be engulfed by the war soon but the story is enjoyable. The princess, Alexandra, wants to be a queen and her mother yearns for the prince to marry her. His mother, the queen, played by Agnes Moorhead, and the tutor, played by Louis Jordan, are excellent. The scenery is gorgeous and the story is enjoyable. The release of the movie was held up until she married Prince Rainier, by all accounts a dullard, so she made a similar bargain with life as the fictional Alexandra.
