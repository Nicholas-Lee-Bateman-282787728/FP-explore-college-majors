7489788,5,B0176IENI8,"This film is a total blast. It's got action, heart and comedy all rolled into one. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and take you on a thrill ride from start to finish. I highly recommend seeing this gem of a film. The acting is brilliant and the Cinematography is truly outstanding. If you missed it in theaters get the DVD and have a great night of fun.

7489789,4,B0176IENI8,"Lucas Vaughn' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) works at the 'Swan Casino' owned by Mafia-Boss 'Francis ''Pope' Silva' (Robert De Niro)
'Luke's' young daughter is hospitalised, seriously ill and in need of expensive treatment, trouble is, 'Luke' has been unable to
keep up the Medical-Insurance payments, she may not be treated if he can't meet the costs.
Fellow employee 'Cox' (Dave Bautista) has plans to rob his employer but needs the knowledge that 'Luke' who has worked there
for many years has, 'Luke' initially is reluctant to take part despite his desperate needs.
He decides to approach his old friend and indeed employer for a loan to cover hospital-fee's but is told.....'no favours'
'Luke' agree's to take part in the Heist, but has his own ideas on how they should go about it......things seem to go to plan, however
security are alerted before they have time to get away, after an exchange of gunfire, they make a break for it, however, spooked by
the sound of gunfire their getaway driver takes off.
Being pursued by Casino-Security they hi-jack a bus, they now have hostages to bargain with....they are almost immediately pursued
by the police, 'Cox' is a loose-cannon and is perfectly willing to demonstrate that he will kill in order to escape whilst 'Luke' try's to
keep the passengers safe, he doesn't want a killing-spree, he'd only agreed to be a part of the robbery to save his daughter,
The bus is pursued by both the 'law' and 'Pope's' henchmen....'Pope' needs the money back, it's not just Casino-Money, its also 'Mob'
money which is laundered at the Casino.
'Luke' strikes up an understanding with one of the pursuing cops 'Kris' (Gina Carano) who has realized that 'Luke' is a steadying influence on-board the bus and wishes it's passengers no harm.
It becomes a tense affair as options become fewer for the robbers....can they avoid being either captured by the police or indeed being killed by 'Pope's' henchmen.
Well worth a spin, a cut above the average movie of this type....tense at times with some action/ fire-fight sequences......whether you buy
or indeed catch it on a movie-channel - it is worth a viewing",1451260800,14,2132,4.925
7489790,4,B0176IENI8,"Its not like someones gonna go crying to the police about someone stealing their dirty cash. Vaughn (Morgan) is struggling financially and things get worse when his sick daughter is endanger of being taken off the transplant list if he doesnt have the money soon. He asks his former boss, a man known as The Pope (De Niro) for a loan and is denied. Left with no options he decides to take the money forcefully, but he didn't expect the getaway to get this out of hand. I had pretty low expectations for this movie, not for any reason but usually these B movies with famous actors tend to only have the big name in it for 5 minutes and the rest is boring and unexciting. This is a rare exception. De Niro has a fair amount of screen time and Morgan is in almost ever scene. The movie is both action packed and emotional. The best way to describe this is as a more intense John Q. A movie where you cant help but root for the father even though what he is doing is illegal. This is a very exciting movie to watch and I was surprised at the quality of it. Its easy to see why this wasn't a big release but as far as a straight to video movie this is one of the best ones I have seen. I recommend this. I give it a B+.",1449878400,35,1214,4.04149377593361

7489870,4,B0176IENI8,"It's about a guy that can't afford medical treatments for his daughter, so he undertakes to rob his former employer.  Naturally this does not go smoothly, and he is marooned on a bus in a hostage-type situation.  The film follows what happens to everyone in this ordeal.

I will be honest and admit up front that I wasn't expecting much from this film.  In some ways it functions as a formulaic genre piece.  But every now and then it show a little glimmer of light and originality and soul that makes me think this is at least a little better than the mass hordes of din that otherwise populate the genre.  Some things of note:

1.  I actually cared about the characters.  There is a scene involving the main character's sick daughter that honestly had me choked up.  I really felt badly for her, because no child deserves to suffer like that.  And, any parent can understand this man, her father's, grief.  As he said at one point ""If I could take on all of her pain, I would.""  I don't doubt it for a second.  But more than that, the characters on the bus prove to be largely sympathetic.  For example, there is a young boy who took the bus to run away from home, because his older sisters wouldn't stop tormenting him.  It would be very easy to do that subplot wrong, but the movie did it right.  I cared about that kid.

2.  Gina Carano can actually act.  I'd guess that at least half the audience for this film will be Gina Carano fans following her from her MMA days.  She doesn't do any kind of incredible stunts in this film.  She's just a good, solid supporting character.  She's not Marlon Brando, but she's solid.

3.  The ending was satisfying.  I won't ruin anything with details, but the ending left me feeling like I wasn't cheated.  The writers actually came up with something, it made sense, and it closed out the story.  That is rare in this genre.

If you watch this movie closely enough, you'll see that it is actually quite sad.  It's a story about a poor man who will do anything to save his little girl.  And every person he comes into contact with has their own problems, their own demons, in fact.  It starts out where it is about the good guys versus the bad guys, but ultimately it is hard to tell who is good or bad (other than that we wish for that poor little girl to be saved).

There are problems of course.  There is a scene involving an aborted road blockage that really makes no sense.  An attempt to stop the hijacked bus was, well, ""not practical"".  And some of the violence is a bit too hard-core for my taste.

Don't expect a masterpiece with this movie.  It's a genre piece.  If you want to see an action film that has a bit of heart and at least dips its toes into the pool of originality, then this might be for you.",1501027200,4,2759,4.304093567251462

7489936,4,B0176IENI8,"When is crime justifiable? Never, but. That seems to be the philosophical question mulled in this fast beat thriller as written by Stephen Cyrus Sepher and directed by Scott Mann. While the film is primarily one of action, the impact of the starting characters is such that the theme seems more thoughtful than most action films.

A father Luke Vaughn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is without the means to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. As a last resort, he partners with a greedy co-worker Cox (Dave Bautista) to rob a casino owned by the agile but terminally ill man called The Pope (Robert DeNiro) and his maniacal right hand man, Dog (Morris Chestnut). When things go awry they're forced to hijack a city bus 657 driven by Bernie (DB Sweeney) and take the passengers hostage. Now, in a high speed chase, Vaughn will not only have to outwit the police, led by Officer Bajos (Gina Carano) who are in hot pursuit, but he will have to contend Dog in order to make it through the day alive. But we quickly learn that things are not what they seem, and Vaughn has more than one card up his sleeve.

Clever, well conceived plot with many twists and turns and brought of by a very fine cast, including small parts by Kate Bosworth, Stephen C Sepher (yes, the writer!), Christopher Rob Bowen, Alyssa Julya Smith, Hawn Tran, and Tyler Jon Olson.  A solid thriller worth an evenings watch. Grady Harp, January 17",1483488000,,1408,4.624

Vaughn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has a sick daughter in the hospital and can't pay the bills.  The Dr. doesn't want the family there anymore and doesn't want to keep the daughter's name on the waiting list.  We don't know anything else about his daughter or what she's dying from.  Vaughn works out a deal with the Dr. to be payed up by a certain day and time.  Vaughn then tries to borrow money from The Pope, (Robert De Niro) his boss, but The Pope is a money monster and doesn't want to lend a helping hand.  Vaughn has nothing left to do, but try and rob the casino he works for.  The robbery gets sloppy and nothing goes as planned or does it?.  I'm not going to spoil the movie encase you decide you want to watch this piece of junk.  This movie really blows and goes over the edge with twists and turns at the end, but isn't done very well.

Vaughn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has been a loyal employee for a number of years and needs money for his daughter's operation. The Pope refuses at the same time a group of guys recruits Vaughn to join in a casino heist.

Things don't go as planned and the film digresses to a long hostage ride on a bus, which compromises much of the film. ""Bus Ride"" would have been a more appropriate name, but doesn't market well.

7490102,3,B0176IENI8,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I love a good con or crime movie. I don't like crime in real life but to watch a plot unfold on film is a treasure. No one gets hurt, good guys usually win one way or another and everyone goes home safe and sound. A good, solid crime film provides enough escapism to keep us entertained and when touched with enough realism to make us wonder holds us till the end of the film. HEIST has some of those trademarks that make it worthwhile but one item that takes it down a notch or two.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan stars as Vaughan, a card dealer on The Swan, a big gaming water bound casino owned by Pope (Robert DeNiro). Vaughan has seen better days but his major concern at present is his daughter. The young child has a disease that has placed her in the hospital but with insurance not covering her long term care and her about to be taken off a waiting list due to payments not made, Vaughan becomes a desperate man.

He approaches Mr. Pope about a $300,000 loan which Pope denies. During this back and forth it comes out that Vaughan was Popes right hand man at one time, destined to take over when he stepped down. The problem was that he developed a conscience, something Popes new protg Dog (Morris Chestnut) doesnt seem to have. After a yelling match Vaughan is fired and escorted off the boat.

Unable to come up with the money the way he hoped, Vaughan instead takes up Cox (David Bautista) offer to help with a robbery of the casino. It seems Cox has noted that the casino is laundering money for the Chinese mob and knows when a big haul is available. Vaughan has the code for the vault for one more day and a plot is laid out to rob the casino.

But as they say, the best laid plans Dog is on board the boat when the heist goes down and takes his men along with numerous machine guns to put a halt to it. When gunfire erupts, Cox wheel man drives off with the getaway car. Another is wounded during the gun battle. Left on foot the trio make a run for it and take over a city bus and all those on board. Trying to keep things down low Dog backs off.

The movie seems to turn into a hostage film here with several twists. The police are in pursuit of the bus filled with kidnap victims. The bad guys are involved in trying to find ways to get the thieves to return the money and kill them. And the thieves are trying to simply survive with the hope of making a run to a friendly fly by night airstrip where Cox has a friend willing to fly them out of the country. Just who comes out on top is yet to be seen and more than one character has a few tricks up their sleeve to play before it all ends.

The movie works best when it sticks to the plotline it has going, a heist film with numerous twists. There are plenty of those involved here, enough that you won't see most of them coming. That portion of the film is well written and well thought out making this a movie that I can highly recommend on that alone. The script then becomes the best and the worst of what we have here.

It becomes the worst when it comes to what I consider lazy screenwriting. An actor can be allowed to portray his character to the point where you know just who he is. He can carry menace with nothing more than a nod of the head. But here the screenwriters felt the need to portray unscrupulous evil by dropping the f bomb on about every third word. While Im not offended I find it unnecessary and overused when done this way. It detracts from a character rather than develops one. When its overused it becomes far too noticeable and boring.

Speaking of actors there are some great performances here. Standing above the rest is Morgan. I first became aware of Morgan as the father of the Winchesters on SUPERNATURAL. Since that time Ive seen him in numerous roles and he always shines. He does so once more in playing Vaughan. DeNiro always does a great job. So much has been written about him that doing more isn't needed. Bautista does a fine job as well. Having moved from the world of the WWE and into acting he seems to be doing well for himself between this role and the one he recently landed in the James Bond SPECTRE film.

In the end the movie is well worth watching, entertaining and filled with surprises. If you can get by the language youll find a crime film that holds up with some of the best but that will more than likely be forgotten since it never played extensively and seems to have landed up on straight to DVD and pay cable. Thats a shame because the potential shown here is more deserving. If you like crime movies then by all means, give this one a watch.",1453334400,,4624,4.226500566251415

7490104,5,B0176IENI8,"Robert De Niro.  What else is to be said.  However, Jeffrey Dean Morgan played the central character.  I first noticed him when he played John Winchester in the series Supernatural and later in Magic City.

In this movie he plays a father desperate to obtain money to pay for a medical procedure to save his daughter's life.  He gets involved with some ruthless characters and steal money from a Casino owned by a gangster Mr. Pope (De Niro).  When the heist goes haywire the chase it on from the police, Mr. Pope, Pope's right hand man (Morris Chestnut) and crooked police on Pope's payroll.

7490106,3,B0176IENI8,"This was an OK heist movie with a sympathetic robber. The De Nero character was complex. Some plot elements are just very implausible, not the way the real world works, at all.  Maybe the writer was very young.  Maybe it was supposed to be a satire of cheesy heist movies. But that's OK; it's a movie, after all.  However, the ending relied on a complete logical impossibility.  Spoiler warning.  Specifically, the hijacking of bus had to be a both a spontaneous unplanned act and also a well-planned act. But here again, it's OK. People see movies like this to escape reality. But I can't help thinking that the director was discussing this issue with the writer and they both agreed no one would ever notice or care.  It's just a popcorn heist movie that will be in the 2-for-5 dollars bin in a few months. And, of course, if you haven't seen the 1995 classic, Heat (also with De Niro) forget about this flick altogether and see that instead.",1452211200,,944,4.556213017751479
7490107,1,B0176IENI8,"This is a morally bankrupt film that is totally incredulous. Leave it to Hollywood to try and get the audience to sympathize with the primary criminal because his daughter has an incurable disease unless he gets the necessary cash. He asks his employer for the dough & is denied so he robs him. Then there is a corrupt cop that is in the pocket of said employer. Bankrupt unrealistic, ludicrous plot with wasted talent.

If you're going to spend this kind of money, at least make it believable. Quit using family problems to get the audience to ""sympathize."" :(",1452211200,,561,4.666666666666667
