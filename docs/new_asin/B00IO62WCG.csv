What an imaginative pastime and fun for wide ranging age groups and abilities.

It's not Jeopardy, but we're challenged by intriguing, if difficult questions, in aviation (about Mach 3.2 aircraft) and US geology (where the strongest megaquake was located); all the more interesting!

Great gift idea and love that the card deck's ""Jokers"" are printed with World Series, Super Bowl and NFL Championship stats.

A Super Deal, in this combo with the ""Remember the 1960s""  DVD, highlighting a decade of captivating nostalgia!

Enjoy,
Marcel
