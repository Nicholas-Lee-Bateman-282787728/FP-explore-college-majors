The plot extensions are weak and the characters lack the charm they had in SMJ.  As a fan of SMJ, I know how tempting it is to pick up this sequel, even though someone tells you its bad, just because you want more SMJ than they gave you.  I did. Take my advice; you can find better stuff to spend your money on than this.",1007337600,,443,4.238095238095238

7890944,4,6305529523,"Eh...how can I describe saber marionette saga...Funny! yep this is a very funny title, that  U will see what ya want to see xtreme funny situations (and with that homosexual guy around-ah! its disgusting how he can love  Otaru so much...). The only thing that bothered me was the alltimeanoying  computer animation that reminded me space strikers or somethig worst but I  must confess that it was the best C.G. that I've seen in an Anime- well I  kinda liked them afterall-.  FINAL ADVISE: buy it if you liked the first  series.(n if not ya can have a very good time!);)----:3(------lime is thy  best of them all, right?",953510400,,620,4.675925925925926
7890945,4,6305529523,"This Sequal to the video series SMJ like it's predisessor is a humorus fun series with just enough depth to keep it interesting without bogging it down. The main characters Otaru, Lime, Cheery, and Bloodberry are back  along with the introduction of a mysterious new marrionette who's the focus  of the series. If you like The original series you enjoy these too",939254400,,362,4.82258064516129
