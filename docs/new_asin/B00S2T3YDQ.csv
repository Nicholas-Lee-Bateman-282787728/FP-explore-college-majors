6951338,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"I really enjoyed this dvd, I did the whole 85 minutes of it and according to my heart rate monitor I burned 650 calories.  It was not easy to complete the 85 minutes because each segment is pretty intense and they work multiple muscles at the same time. I have done many programs like insanity tracy Anderson, Barre, Jari Love, and Cathe just to mention some and this dvd is challenging and it will give you a lot for what you pay for. The only thing is that it does not have a cool down so you have to come up with your own.",1426982400,12,525,4.048076923076923
6951359,5,B00S2T3YDQ,I've done half of these workouts so far and I love them! Very high energy. I'm just getting back into working out after a good 8 months of slacking. These 10 min videos are perfect to keep me working different muscles. The instructors are great I love that their is an option to turn them off once you know the routine,1454198400,3,318,4.229508196721311

6951361,4,B00S2T3YDQ,"""The 30-Day Fat Burn"" contains eight, ten-minute workouts that are rather intense, but they are fun. Astrid McGuire and Danielle Pascente are the instructors. Astrid and Danielle each instruct some workouts solo. The girls co-instruct two of them. Astrid and Danielle are fabulous instructors who explain everything thoroughly. This is perfect for anyone seeking a quick, intense workout.",1449619200,4,388,5.706896551724138
6951362,5,B00S2T3YDQ,Love this workout DVD!  Contains 8 separate 10 minute routines which keeps it interesting and is very motivating!,1439251200,,113,5.277777777777778
6951363,5,B00S2T3YDQ,So I like this work out video but I wasn't aware that I needed dumbbells.  So make sure you get those cause majority of the workouts they use dumbbells but either than that it's great intense workouts which I love and it's only 10 minutes long,1437004800,,243,4.282608695652174
6951364,4,B00S2T3YDQ,"This DVD was more than I expected. I get 'winded' from these short little work-outs. They really maximize your effort in a short period of time. I always do at least 3 workouts or more, and I definitely feel like I worked up a good sweat. I like the variety and the customized options. The 2 host are very friendly.",1436745600,3,315,4.266666666666667
6951365,5,B00S2T3YDQ,Excellent product and seller I recommend both!,1435708800,,46,5.714285714285714
6951366,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"This is possibly one of the most underrated DVD's ever. Glad I found this gem.  I use Jilian Michaels religiously but I found this to be better (and harder). With 8 10-minute workouts, you truly get a bang of your buck and can easily mix it up. It's alot of squats and lunges (with workouts 7 and 8 more targeted towards cardio). Love love love it...my new go-to workout!",1433376000,2,371,4.3768115942028984
6951367,5,B00S2T3YDQ,These workouts will kick your butt!,1431734400,,35,5.0
6951368,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"I have been consistently working out for years so I would consider myself an advanced exerciser.  I typically don't do more than 30 minutes per day, so what I do has to be challenging enough to get me sweating and/or breathless.  Because of this,  I normally stick with Cathe, Kelly Coffey-Meyer, Jari Love, and Jackie Warner because of their great workouts but also fun but no-nonsense, professional style.  Lately I have been mixing in 3 of the 10 Minute Solution dvd segments, which I love because I can do whatever combination I feel like, and they seem to go by much faster than one 30 minute workout (all in my head, I know), even though I've only found a few of those dvd's that are even close to being tough enough for me.  This dvd will add to my 10 minute arsenal nicely, and these workouts are more challenging so they will likely be used more often.  All of these workouts are challenging enough, though some more than others.  The instructors are young, but there's no annoying fluff here - they do a good job staying focused on the workout while staying appropriately lighthearted.  There are 8 workouts ranging from 8-13 minutes each.  They are available on youtube, so you don't even need to purchase the dvd, but it is such a bargain that I went ahead and bought it anyway so I would have the flexibility to use either media.

My only complaint is that the descriptions of the individual workouts are rather vague - not very descriptive or very accurate, so I needed to watch them first to have a better idea of what each entails.  Here's my brief descriptions:

Cardio Burn - Compound upper and lower body moves with weights, a few cardio intervals
Dynamic Strength - Kettlebell style workout using a dumbbell
Toned Abs and Arms - All toning
Metabolic Booster - Core and leg toning, some cardio intervals
Leg and Butt Shaper - Mostly squats and lunges.  A few moves are dynamic for a little cardio
Total Body Shred - Cardio intervals along with compound moves with upper and lower body using dumbbells
Maximum Hiit - Cardio intervals - all different types of jacks - along with upper body toning
Lower Body Blast - Cardio intervals - jogging in place, high knees - along with leg toning",1427673600,28,2204,4.591836734693878
8697181,5,B00S2T3YDQ,Great workout video.  I do this on days when I can't get out and run,1513555200,,68,3.533333333333333
8697182,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"I am a moderate to advanced level exerciser and  get a great workout with this DVD.  Most of the segments make me really sweat and work hard.  I love how I can mix and match the segments to change up my workouts every day, alternating strength with cardio as needed.  I usually do four workouts per day and plan to increase as I can.  Highly recommend.",1487980800,,352,4.2727272727272725
8697183,4,B00S2T3YDQ,I like it but it's hard.  I exercise everyday but this is intense. If you're looking to really up your program this will work.  Be prepared to sweat.,1475193600,,149,4.285714285714286
8697184,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"I have over 200 workout DVDs, and this is absolutely one of the better ones.  I need efficient workouts which are challenging, interesting, and can help kick my butt early in the morning before work.  Also, I MUCH prefer non-annoying or abrasive instructors.  This fulfills all my criteria and will definitely be a staple in my rotation.",1474502400,3,337,4.87719298245614
8697185,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"I like that I'm not repeating the exercises in one session because I get bored of doing the same thing in the same workout. I actually lost 12 pounds in 3 months (about 1 pound a week) last year and had kept it off for many months then I started doing other workouts on YouTube and some weight slowly went back on so I decided I'm going to go back to this workout. I like workout programs that deliver results. Part of the reason I liked this program is that it doesn't feel like a drag doing the workout but helps you stay on track by following the schedule so you at least can log in that you did work out and I think that's what helped me lose the weight. You won't see the results right away but if you keep pressing on, they will come. Maybe not 5 pounds in a week but you want to burn the fat slowly and not just water weight or muscle and I think it really helps burn fat. If I stayed on the program for a year, I probably would have reached my goal weight.  It helps to keep track of calories on a fitness app like My Fitness Pal. The calendar is very helpful, especially for those who need structure and guidance, and gives you 5 rest days throughout the month. I love that the program incorporates nothing else but dumbbells if any equipment. If you follow the calendar, some days (in the early part of the month) your workouts are 10 minutes and the rest of the month, about 20 minutes where you're doing two 10 minute workouts (one workout is 25 minutes). I really like that the workouts are either 10 or 20 minutes as I don't have the patience, time or tolerance for 30 minutes or more workouts. I like workouts that do a lot of exercises in the least amount of time and this is definitely it. They incorporate multiple moves in one movement (which is key) like squats with presses, lunges with curls, etc. Here is what the calendar is like for those who need it to factor in their decision to purchase:

Day 1 Dynamic Strength
Day 2 Cardio Extreme
Day 3 Legs and Butt Shaper
Day 4 Metabolic Booster
Day 5 Rest
Day 6 Total Body Shred
Day 7 Cardio Burn (13:30 mins)
Day 8 Rest
Day 9 Lower Body Blast
Day 10 Total Body Shred
Day 11 Legs and Butt Shaper
Day 12 Rest
Day 13 Toned Abs and Arms + Maximum HIIT
Day 14 Cardio Crush
Day 15 Rest
Day 16 Cardio Extreme + Total Body Shred
Day 17 Lower Body Blast
Day 18 Metabolic Booster + Legs and Butt Shaper
Day 19 Dynamic Strength
Day 20 Cardio Crush + Lower Body Blast
Day 21 Rest
Day 22 Cardio Extreme + Total Body Shred
Day 23 Cardio Burn + Toned Abs and Arms (25 minutes)
Day 24 Maximum HIIT + Legs and Butt Shaper

8697186,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"Effective tape with clear cuing and effective use of the time.  The exercises are interesting and do target the designated muscle groups.  The leaders provide positive, specific directions and encouragement in challenging segments. They do not hector their audience which is condescending and irritating to the some buyers (namely me) of workout DVDs.",1465689600,,351,5.60377358490566

8697188,5,B00S2T3YDQ,I love this video! 10-12 minute intense workouts. I try to do 4 together. Great combination of strength training and cardio to make you sweat and burn calories. Never boring!,1460073600,,174,4.833333333333333
8697189,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"You can customize these workouts, there are 8 10 minute workouts and you can choose to let the whole program play through or you choose the 10 minute segment as you wish to do them. They are fun, they are hard but you don't get bored because they switch up the routine pretty quickly and the time is up before you know it.  Hope they make more, didn't care for the instructors or routine in the 30 day Butt workout.",1459382400,,415,4.1875
8697190,5,B00S2T3YDQ,"These workouts are tough, I only do 20 mins in the evening to supplement my morning workout.  I like the variety.  There is cardio, weights, and abs. I highly recommend. Only thing that annoys me is the blonder instructor who pauses (looks like on purpose) on the beginning of some exercises to make the other one look bad... lol",1455062400,2,329,4.559322033898305
