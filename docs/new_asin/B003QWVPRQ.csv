8402691,5,B003QWVPRQ,"Excellent, with actual footage of Shostakovich himself before he died.",1506124800,,70,6.1
8402692,5,B003QWVPRQ,Saw the Met's production of 'The Nose' before watching the dvd - both equally enjoyable. Nice to have the dvd as part of our library to which we can return whenever we want to,1383436800,,175,4.176470588235294
8402693,3,B003QWVPRQ,"Shostakovich's opera, based on Nikolai Gogol's tale of ""The Nose,"" gave the young composer an opportunity to use his sense of humor with material from a great Russian author. This revived production is likely to be of great interest to all opera fans.",1382140800,,251,4.8604651162790695
8402694,4,B003QWVPRQ,"I bought this DVD because I will see ""The Nose"" at the Met in a few weeks, and I wanted to have some idea of what to expect. The bizarre tale reminds me of ""Ex Utero,"" a novel by Laurie Foos, about a woman who loses her uterus and, like Little Bo Peep, doesn't know where to find it. As for ""The Nose,"" I needed two trips through to understand exactly what was going on. I doubt if many people will leave the theater humming the tunes, but the music, at times frantic and grating, works for this story. The singing is excellent, but the lip synching, as I was warned, is terrible. All in all, it is an entertaining show to which I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could..",1378080000,2,666,4.053030303030303
8402695,5,B003QWVPRQ,"I just love all Shostakovich, and am constantly looking for works of his that I don't have.
This opera took a lot of finding, and, if you are a Shostakovich fan, is well worth seeing.
also recommended is Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and Moscow Cherymushki.",1374710400,,251,4.6
8402696,4,B003QWVPRQ,"Essential Shostakovich indeed, as this opera must rank among the very best in his oeuvre. Although written some 50 years before, people only became generally acquainted with it when in the early 80's or so a studio Melodiya recording was published in the USSR as a two-LP album and reissued in Western Europe by HMV, plus in the USA by what was then known as Columbia Records (due to copyright issues, I remember the HMV UK issue including a libretto whereas Columbia's didn't). The present video is supposed to stem from the very same public performances by the Moscow Chamber Opera on which the Melodiya recording was based, yet it looks to me, for some reason not explained neither in the packaging nor in the dvd's contents, that the original soundtrack has been scrapped and replaced by the Melodiya, studio recording as image and sound often go their own particular ways and audience noise is non existent, strange indeed for a public performance in a small venue as Moscow's Musical Theatre. You even ""see"" noises that don't actually ""sound"", from which I suppose source defects prevented usage of the original.

The production by the Moscow Chamber Opera being quite basic, staged with what one can presume to have been minimal material resources given the adverse circumstances under which the project had to develop in the mid 1970's USSR, this video is none the less a substantial document, with the vibrancy and excitement of a first-night show (which indeed it was as performances had been banned by the Communist rgime's censors since the opera's inception), with Shostakovich himself being present (he would die soon thereafter).

I don't know of further performances having taken place of this mordant score, either in post-Soviet Russia or elsewhere, but this is indeed top Shostakovich and I cannot urge strongly enough any one with even the slightest interest in his music to get a hold of this dvd.",1355184000,5,1918,4.953416149068323
8402697,3,B003QWVPRQ,"I was very excited to see that the legendary 1974 Moscow Chamber Opera production of ""The Nose"" was being released on DVD, but, on watching it, I was disappointed to find that the performance, taped in 1979, has been very obviously dubbed over with the well-known audio recording made four years earlier and conducted by Rozhdestvensky, who, by the way, is not the person seen conducting the performance on the video. As what we hear was made solely as a sound recording in a studio and what we see is a live performance onstage, the disconnect in acoustic quality, synchronization and dynamic is obvious and glaring. I don't know whether the original Soviet television recording from which the disc was made was originally shown in this form or whether this was a later addition meant to mask a poor soundtrack, but it makes for frustrating viewing and listening. All of this is made more unfortunate by the fact that the same production was recorded in the 1990's in the same venue and with (mostly) the same cast and released (with it's own live soundtrack intact) on a Japanese Laser Disc. What a shame THAT performance could not have been released on DVD instead of this bizarre amalgamation, which can only be recommended as a somewhat unusual historical document.",1279497600,43,1270,4.830275229357798
8402698,4,B003QWVPRQ,"Based on a Story of Gogol, this opera, by the young Shostakovich, concerns a military officer whose nose deserts his face and establishes an independent identity. Our devastated hero spends most of the three acts trying to retrieve and reattach the renegade proboscis. Every character and situation in the work is utterly bizarre; the music is brash and noisy.
Although this 1979 filming seems to have been done in a small theater with limited camera angles available, the visual realization is just about perfect. The musical side of the performance could scarcely be improved upon, although the tenor who takes the role of the nose does not sing with the specified nasal tone. The entire cast is well up to the often extreme vocal demands of their roles. There is some rehearsal footage with the composer present, although it must have been taped in preparation for much earlier performances as Shostakovich was no longer alive at the time of this recording.
I would certainly have assigned this DVD five stars except for the fact that the performance we see is apparently not the one we hear. The lip sync is off, never by a consistent interval. But it's a marvelous recording of a work not otherwise available on home video.",1279411200,26,1228,4.852380952380952
