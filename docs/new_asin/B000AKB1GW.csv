2389041,3,B000AKB1GW,"Frank Miller brings ""The Spirit"" to the movie theatre, a comic book adaptation that had serious potential like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>&nbsp;(which I loved), but falls a bit flat.

An undefeatable, nearly indestructible superhero with regenerative powers, The Spirit defends Central City from all who would do it harm.  Once known as a policeman named Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht), he now uses the city as a living, breathing weapon; The Spirit leaps and bounds from one rooftop to another, battling evil, in particular a criminal mastermind named the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson).

With revolutionary visual effects, or at least as revolutionary as Sin City, it is difficult to turn the other cheek.  Stunning color contrasts, typical Miller, are done amazingly well to provide feeling, emotion, and thematic essence.  Blending the characters' wardrobes into the backgrounds and shadows, as well as against them, the comic book feel is nearly flawless.  It's just too bad that it couldn't overcome the negatives.

The biggest downfall to the The Spirit is the inefficient usage of the actors' talents.  Samuel L. Jackson is not nearly terrifying or intense enough, and nowhere near what he accomplished in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Time-to-Kill/dp/0790729660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Time to Kill</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rules-of-Engagement/dp/B00005B3P5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rules of Engagement</a>.  Eva Mendes, a jewel-crazed seductress, is for the most part cast in shadows and unappealing angles, negating her beauty and curves for the majority of the movie.  Gabriel Macht is a superhero faade, a chiseled jaw without substance, a character who deadpans throughout the entire movie, never enticing the viewer to root for the good guys.  And Scarlett Johansson is plain on purpose, designed to pale in comparison to SLJ and Mendes she never gets a chance to show off either her talents or her ""talents"".  Last but not least, the lackeys for the Octopus are absolutely loathsome, not funny in the least.

Using an inner monologue as a device to drive the movie forward, it's clearly designed with a thought or goal in mind.  I have no doubt that the makers of the film accomplished what they wanted.  For my tastes, however, there's simply too much chop-socky and kapow, and too little substance.  It has the action and dialogue from the 1950s alongside contemporary cinematography.  The artistic positives are present, but the negatives of banality and campiness drag the entire movie down with each poor attempt at slap-stick.  It's a shame really, because the cast could have done much more, but it's simply clear they were directed poorly.  Aside from the gorgeous women (Johansson and Mendes are joined by Stana Katic, Jaime King, Sarah Paulson, and Paz Vega) and SLJ's over-the-top persona, the movie's just too silly - downright stupid at times (the head on the foot scene) - to be truly enjoyable.",1230422400,,3144,5.855263157894737
2389042,4,B000AKB1GW,"A murdered cop, Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht), returns from the grave to reemerge as the Spirit, a hero who's objective is to fight the bad forces in Central City.  On the other hand, there's the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson), the nemesis of the Spirit.  He also happens to be the man who brought Colt back from the beyond and they have more in common than the Spirit is aware of.  The Octopus has also gone mad with power on his quest to become immortal and the only one who can stop him is the Spirit.  With the city as his weapon, the Spirit vows to stomp out the evil brought upon by the Octopus.

Frank Miller brings the legendary comic by Will Eisner to the big screen.  And he does it in great fashion.  ""The Spirit"" is a visual feast, bringing the same effects seen in Miller's other project ""Sin City.""  Yes, some scenes looked almost like a complete rip from ""Sin City,"" but that's just the way Frank Miller directs.  The black and white scenes, the gloomy, noir-ish feel, the inner monologues, the main character with mental and or physical hardships, are all trademark Miller.

Granted ""The Spirit"" does have its flaws.  Some scenes were lengthy and took a turn towards sheer silliness and the dialogue was at times a bit tacky.  But overall, the film was nothing short of amazing.  Critics can nitpick at the dialogue and the similarity to ""Sin City"", but the dialogue was taken from the comics and you got to stick with what works.  What will those same critics do when ""Sin City 2"" comes out?  The same complaints will probably resurface.  Accept ""The Spirit"" for what it is; an all around entertaining extravaganza, especially in the visual department even if it has been done before.",1230336000,2,1695,4.562913907284768
2389043,3,B000AKB1GW,"Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht) died in the line of duty, but was resurrected by science.  He now wears a mask and acts on behalf of Central City's Commissioner Dolan (Dan Lauria) ostensibly as a spy. In truth, he's on a quest to rid the city of arch villain, The Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson).

The thing is, the Octopus tells Spirit that they've got more in common than he knows.  Neither of them can die, for instance, but the Spirit doesn't know why.

Now he's got even more trouble.  Old flame Sand Serif (Eva Mendez) is back in town and she's in league with his nemesis to acquire relics from Olympus itself.

""The Spirit"" is shot in the noir style of director Frank Miller's successful ""Sin City.""  The dialogue is pure film noir with a whole lot of camp and cliche thrown in, some from Will Eisner's original comic book series homage from many of the B detective films you've seen through the years.

While the film was not billed as a comedy, it was hard not to laugh at the lines and situations.  Samuel L. Jackson makes a great arch-villain and his  monologueing is just classic.  Male fanboys are going to enjoy the various femme fatales in the film, including Sand Serif, Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansen), and Officer Morganstern (Stana Katic) who gives the best line in the whole film.

2389044,2,B000AKB1GW,"Extremely bizarre and only somewhat entertaining, Frank Miller's The Spirit focuses all of its efforts on flashy visuals and cartoonish humor and forgets to leave room for action and story.  While the old-school comic book feel refreshingly replaces the humdrum bravado of the Hulks and Fantastic Fours of late, one can only take so much Greek mythology, Nazis, and egg.

After escaping death (kind of), Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht) dons the guise of The Spirit, an almost immortal superhero who tirelessly patrols the streets of Central City attempting to rid the world of its most notorious evildoer - The Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson).  When Denny's old flame, Sand Saref (Eva Mendes), mysteriously appears in the city she swore she'd never return to, The Spirit must uncover her ties to The Octopus, his own connection to the vile schemer, and ultimately stop the criminal mastermind's latest plot for world domination - all while juggling the affections of every woman he meets and the ever-nearing grasp of the Angel of Death.

It would probably be unfair to criticize the terrible acting, since one gets the sense that most of the ridiculousness is intentional. The actors don't have much to work with anyway, considering how clich and commonplace the dialogue is, which could either be attributed to Frank Miller's take on the classic Will Eisner comics, or the way they were actually written. But since the look of the film is essentially all thanks to Miller and his inability to stray away from the impressive visual styles created for his previous project Sin City, it can be assumed that much of The Spirit's shortcomings are from the mind of the notoriously dark writer. At least the wild costumes and gorgeous girls provide enough eye candy to keep the simpleminded occupied.

The visual effects simply don't serve any purpose for The Spirit; they look entirely too similar to Sin City, giving the impression that Miller is ripping off his own work. Plus, paying homage to Eisner's original artwork from the 40's comic book series couldn't possibly require harsh contrasting blacks and whites and reds. Perhaps its only benefit is to give the whole goofy concept a little more seriousness and a spattering of darkness. Although much of the target audience will be completely uninformed about the source material for this otherworldly masked crime fighter, it's safe to assume that very little of the original Spirit is present in this surprisingly dull new vision.

Colt was raised in ""a bad part of town""... it's cliche on old trope on lack of imagination. Hard to say a Frank Miller movie is boring but if you've seen Sin Sity, you already seen the best part of this. Eva Mendez is easy on the eyes but the rest of the movie is not. The ""bad"" guy is really bad.. the minions are silly, Scarlett Johansson is hard to miss but boy did they try. The under current of the city left me with a WTH? feeling. Seriously, even a Frank MIller fan boy will want to give this a miss. It is really bad on many many levels.
Wooden acting, missing motivation - very little worse than a character suddenly doing something out of character only because. This movie seemed like Sin City minus the drama, minus the urgency, minus the sex. Save your money!!",1468368000,2,881,4.25

The early fight scene between the Spirit and the Octopus just dragged on and on. Samuel L. Jackson has never given a bad performance, but all the flummery in his scenes detract from one's ability to suspend disbelief. Redefining Will Eisner's genre-busting ""ghost cop"" was quite a challenge I'm sure, but goofy and ghoulish are strange bedfellows. Not since the intensely disappointing
""Batman & Robin"" from director Joel Schumacher has a masked crime fighter movie been so off-balance. ""The Spirit"" has some of the stylishness of ""Sin City,"" but none of the energy.

2389065,5,B000AKB1GW,"I've discovered from most negative reviews and opinions I've read and heard from this movie are negative for 3 reasons:
1 - They wanted a regular superhero movie
2 - They wanted Sin City 2
3 - They already hated Frank Miller
These are all unfair reasons to hate a movie. Firstly, The Spirit himself is not a regular superhero. The Spirit was written in the Golden Age of comics. Most of the characters from back then were eaisly updated eg Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman. But ""updating"" a character like the Spirit would take away what has made Will Eisner's character last this long. He's a character of his time. The visuals of the character and the world and especially the way they spoke. If you tried to make Christopher Nolan's The Spirit sure it would be a great crime movie. But it would lose everything Will Eisner did to make it amazing.

Frank Miller is unapologetically a Will Eisner fanatic. On top of that he loves similar books like the Mickey Spillane detective novels or Dashiell Hammett. All written with a similar voice and style. Will Eisner and Frank Miller were also close friends. So for Frank Miller to write and direct a Spirit movie is a match made in heaven. But when a guy who was friends with the creator, a fan of what he's now in charge of, makes a movie you don't expect it to be a new fresh thing. It was only ever going to be a love letter. Frank Miller himself says in the audio commentary ""this is my love letter to WIll Eisner"". And it is. Visually it is. The writing is very much that. And the story is bonkers crazy. But you read any comic from that time period. There was no logic. There was no explanation. It was just crazy for the sake of fun. Thats what this movie was. Yes it takes liberties with the characters origin and so on, but its in the very style of the original comic book.

A lot of the negative reviews also complain about these very stylistic choices. That the dialogue is wooden and unrealistic. That it doesn't feel natural. Thats because it isnt. This movie is bringing back that 1930's/1940's style. No movie from that era plays well by todays standards. Its of its time.

I highly recommend listening to the audio commentary. It breaks my heart at times because of the films failure critically and monetarily, but Frank Miller and Deborah Del Prete clearly had a lot of fu nmaking this movie. And it shows. And it is so perfectly cast. Everyone feels of that time and are acting like stars and starlets of old.

This is a great comic book brought to life. It isn't a take, or a movie version. It is basically a motion comic. Regular movie goers can't quite grasp that. They wanted a ""normal"" movie with ""normal"" people speaking and acting ""normally"".

This is a movie made by a fan. I think hardcore comic fans deep down are jealous. Because I know, if any other fan had a chance to make this movie, it would be how they wanted it. But it wouldnt be how everyone else wanted it. We each, as fans, bring and take what we love about these comics. This is just what Frank Miller loves.

On whatever terms you evaluate a movie, this is completely top shelf. Given, it is a comic book on film and you should take it that way. Not unlike the sixties camp Batman show. But let's get critical. Script, Acting, Casting, Filming, Direction, Editing and Production is as good as it gets. If good movies have some recipe, some plot and some style and throw in just enough comedy and just enough sex appeal, it has it all just right. Yes it is faithful to the original Spirit. And to boot, the DVD edition I have gives you both full screen and widescreen.

If this were a Batman movie - if we photo-shopped every frame and put in Batman in place of the Spirit, everyone would give it five stars. Maybe I like it because I like vintage comic books.

 The Dialog was absolutely laughable and sounded like it was written by someone who gets sexually excited by Raymond Chandler dialog (Sin Citys the same). And the spirit came off as an ersatz batman. I saw the Warren Publishing reprints of Eisners The Spirit and I wondered why Miller bothered getting the rights. He couldve done the same thing with a batman knockoff ala Holy Terror The Eisner Estate should sue Miller.

Denny Colt was one of the best cops Central City has ever known. After being killed in the line of duty, he returns from the grave as the Spirit and fights evil as a masked crime fighter. Enter the Octopus, an evil villain bent on gaining immortality and will do anything and stop at nothing to achieve it.

So basically this is Sin City meets an old pulp superhero, the Spirit, who was created by Will Eisner. We can thank Frank Miller for the Sin City spin on this flick as he was the man behind it. Which, to me, is fine. I thought Sin City was the breath of fresh air movies needed and adding that kind of style and storytelling to the world of the Spirit is cool with me. Granted, I never read the comics so I cant comment on if that was a smart move for an adaptation or not. I can comment that the costume changegoing from an all-blue suit and fedora with a red tie, to an all-black suit and fedora with a red tiewas a cool move as a guy in a blue suit, a non-spandex one, wouldnt translate to film very well.

This movie is big time over-the-top, so leave your expectations for a realistic comic book movie at the door. The characters take a ton of abuse and keep on kicking. I mean, the Spirit taking a toilet to the head and still standing after? Come on. But if you go in not expecting a realistic superhero movie, then this won't bother you.

On a visual scale, this movie is aces. The black and white, the spot coloring, the glows, the different animated scenes thrown inagain, like Sin City but a really cool way to do a super flick and it makes me wonder how it might look if it was done with some of the more major franchisesi.e. if Captain America had a couple slick, three-or-four-second animated scenes as part of the movie. You never know.

Gabriel Macht did just fine as the Spiritwas tough, suave and able to hold his own on the action scale. Samuel L. Jackson as the Octopuswell, hes SLJ so you got SLJ. I love the guy but hes the same guy in every movie despite what hes supposed to be. Granted, there are a few exceptions (i.e. The Cavemans Valentine).

Bottom line: this is a crazy ride and cool detective story blended with superhero action and mayhem. It won't change your life, but it certainly might add to it in a little way.

2389101,4,B000AKB1GW,"THE SPIRIT

I couldn't wait to see this when it first came out since Frank Miller was directing it. So when it came out I was there to see it and then bought the DVD when it was released. This is a fun flick in that Sin City style that had became popular at the time. It is full of that Noir style and is written as such as well. Sure this isn't the best movie ever made but it is a good one.

The movie follows a cop who is killed but then comes back as The Spirit. He can live after taking inhuman punishment. As it turns out there is someone else that can do about the same, The Octopus. His archenemy is plotting something new, something that could make him immortal. Now every character in the city is coming out for one last showdown between the two.

This has that noir feel that Miller has become known for and even has that feel with the writing. Miller wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Now I will admit that the film has flaws and is far from perfect but you should know by now what a Frank Miller flick is going to be like. The acting is perfect for the story, style and writing and there are some good looking ladies in this. On the DVD you get behind the scenes stuff as well as a commentary by Miller and a producer. Its too bad that this film didn't do any better because it stalled Millers film career.",1424131200,,1329,4.084291187739463

In this stunted feeble minded repetitive romp,  the cops are portrayed as jewish star of david necklace wearing , not crazy, just well equipped WHITE good guys and gals. The black man who dresses up as a chinese, russian? and nazi among other nationalities is the bad guy. In other words he represents the OTHER races that wasp/jews spirit don't want in their city.
There's not much to like in this one, while it starts off in a mediocre vein, it starts repeating by the middle never bringing anything new to the table.
Poor casting, what cast?
Terrible script, the complexity of the typical Eisner 8 page story puts this 90 min gob to shame!!
Racist, as noted the only black character is EVIL INCARNATE!
Eisners Octopus was not black, and the comic had NO black villains that I recall other than some henchman, the spirit had a young curious and gutsy black sidekick.
Self indulgent garbage, Miller has another cameo, and even drew the terrible art for the end credits, where I would have expected some actual Eisner work. But this isn't Eisners spirit, its a childish graphitti by a spent shell of a creator.
It sounds bad, musically deficient and verbally annoying with Sam Jackson yelling the same thing over and over again, he even has identicle fat balding henchmen who all repeat the same phrases. The actors and the director are at times unsure how to deliver this stilted grade school garbage.
Speaking of garbage, i'll be dropping the spirit back in it. Im sure if some hobo can rustle up a bluray player he will enjoy the funniest scene where the spirit, machete through the heart, walks past a hobo who says..."" I know how you feel buddy. You should meet my wife"" with no emphasis on ""MY"".",1415491200,3,1969,4.52808988764045

This movie is extremely similar to the Adam West, Batman TV series with plenty of star name actors in strange roles.

It is my conviction that Stana had to work her way ""up the ladder"" to stardom, a trek thru B-movies (or lower) and sometimes dubious, violent roles of short duration.  Watching ""The Spirit"" is to recapture something of the charm of the Saturday afternoon matinee serials of my 20's-30's childhood: a reliable plot; identifliable villains, hero, heroine, and sidekicks;  noisy gun battles, ambushes, and a corrupt metropolis for a man of mythic strength to save over and over again.  Stana appears as a policewoman, and a comic one at that, playing off a standard corrupt Irish mayor.  It's a spear-carrier role, but she's logging time in front of the camera, she gives a bit of depth to the comic cop creation, and she is still alive and in good spirits as the curtain falls.

The Spirit takes place in the 1930/40's, so the key to understanding this comes from books and movies from that periodhard boiled detective novels, film noir private detective movies like Sunset Boulevard, and movie serial shorts of the time (1940 Green Hornet or 1943/1949 Batman serialsboth are available on YouTube). There is particular style of storytelling specific to that era...the dialogue is forced with odd speech patterns and a strange, stylized,  ""hip"" slang that most people today think is strange. Miller's inspiration draws upon them and results in a heavily stylized drama.

Those who don't like The Spirit aren't familiar with those archetypes (or only minimally) and have never seen those movie classics. I would suggest you familiarize yourself with film history of that era before watching this. It will make a difference in your perception and whether you like it or not.

2389153,3,B000AKB1GW,"For anybody who loves comics, the combination of Frank Miller and Will Eisner would seem to be absolute magic. Eisner may very well be the finest of the old time comic artists, with a distinctive style and hard boiled sensibility--and a fantastic sense of humor--while Miller has been responsible for some of the finest contemporary graphic novels.

Contemporary computer animation allows the Spirit to look remarkably like the original Eisner comics--and Miller manages to channel a bit of the absurd humor that made the Spirit unique. The acting is actually OK---I at least have a really hard time taking comic film acting seriously. While I think it is an unfortunate choice to make the Octopus (played by Samuel Jackson) an actual character (in the original comic book the Octopus was just a disembodied pair of gloves), Samuel Jackson does help redeem this choice with a remarkably over the top and self mocking performance.

The plot is incredibly thin--yet no thinner than the typical comic book movie--and the characters pretty cardboard. Frankly, I think this is par for the course for a comic book movie.

In short, I feel this movie fails to rise above the genre--which begs the question why it is so reviled.

I think this movie is despised for two reasons. One, it is constantly self mocking. When the Spirit is seeking Sand Serif, he shows doormen at the local upscale hotels a Xerox she made of her buttocks. Naturally one doorman recognizes her. This sequence is not really funny yet does seem to match Eisner's strange humor in the old comic book. Eisner would constantly have sequences in his comics which seemed to suggest the whole idea of a superhero was absurd--and Miller channels this humor. In a sense, this actually insults the audience who takes comic books and comic book movies seriously. Secondly, the Spirit has many more female characters than the normal comic book movies--and the females play a varied number of roles in the movie. Comic book movies are fueled by misplaced male aggression--females rarely play such a prominent role.

The 1940s sensibility of the movie also might puzzle people. I saw the movie on a Blu-ray disc with a friend who had bought it. He asked me why everyone made such a big deal about their hats--and I pointed out that most men wore hats in the era the film was set.

The movie in my view is the not an absolute failure--like the old Shadow movie however, it points out the difficulty of making a period comic book movie. This is not an unwatchable movie--any movie with this many beautiful women dressed so nicely has a lot to be said for it--but it is not a particularly good one. But it does make for a diverting few hours and brings a bit of the spirit of Eisner's work to a contemporary audience.",1380153600,2,2766,4.752083333333333
2389154,2,B000AKB1GW,"My review of this purchase:
Don't waste your time or money on this farce.  For me way too much profanity disrespecting GOD.  Cartoon like acting by all. Really Samuel L. Jackson did this movie of his own free will?  He must of owed someone a favor. If you want to see Stana Katic in a movie as a decent and respectable character, this would be it.  Unfortunately you have to sit through the movie to see that character.

For me,the only pleasant thing in this movie that I could appreciate was that Stana didn't use any F bombs (apparently her favorite word from her interviews), snort drugs, smoke, drink, murder anybody, unbutton her blouse, take her clothes off or let someone take them off of her, or perform any sexually explicate acts real or simulated on any of the men or women in the cast.  This is the only movie she has been in that I have been able to watch clear to the end and it was a stinker.  Usually I never get past the trailer or Youtube clips to watch any of her vehicles.  I don't want to feel like I need to shower after watching a movie because of the enormous amount of filth spewed out of the actor's dialogue or the actions of the roles portrayed.

Stana's performance as a funny cop character in this effort reminded me of the humor Beckett shows in Castle.  Her enormous talent and beauty are displayed in this small part but still this movie choice has to go in the B movie straight to DVD list just as all of her others.

Stana's use of vulgar language, her actions, and entertainment choices are offensive and very disappointing to me.  She could be my daughter, my daughter is about her age and I just wonder what must her parents think and I can't help but wonder about all those young fans who idolize her and want to be like her because of Beckett when they discover what the real person is like.  How must they and her parents feel in their hearts when they hear Stana talk like she does or see what she is willing to do in a movie selling herself for a producer or director's praise and accolades or some useless award that in the end counts for nothing.

I'll pray for a change of her heart, someone must, she is too blessed with talent and beauty from GOD to flip Him off with her life choices, actions, and vocabulary like she does.",1376784000,,2419,4.33259423503326

2389160,4,B000AKB1GW,"Will Eisner arguably invented the ""graphic novel"" as we know it today. His comics brought real depth and maturity to the western visual literature. So, naturally, people had no idea what to make of it when it first appeared.

""The Spirit"" was one of Eisner's comics. So, naturally, people have no idea what to make of the movie version. It can't be a noir - it's too comic-bookish. It can't be a comic book, since The spirit is more Everyman than Superman. And it can't Everyman's story, since it's too noir.

But, if you can settle yourself into one of the spaces between the genres (or in the dark corners where different genres' forbidden love brings its love-child), this offers some good fun. Dreadfully earnest, to a campy degree, you just have to take the plunge, suspend disbelief, and enjoy. Maybe not a shining star to lead other comic movies down through the ages, it still shines a little light into a city's darker corners.

2389166,1,B000AKB1GW,"Dear Hollywood,
Please do not ever let a comic-book author direct a movie ever again. If you need a reason why, just consider Frank Miller.

And if you are stupid enough to hire a comic-book author to direct a movie, you deserve to get a product like ""The Spirit"" -- a massive confusing mess that was clearly envisioned by a man who had never really directed even a short film before. And as expected, the story is an absurd overcomplicated mess, which is only slightly redeemed by Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson.

Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht) was a rookie cop who was killed by the evil Octopus (Jackson) and then mysteriously revived. Now he is the ""spirit"" (aka masked crime fighter) of his city because... well, he claims the city is female and his soulmate. I wish I were kidding.  He's called in on a case where the Octopus is feuding with beautiful Sand Saref (Eva Mendes) over a pair of locked chests.

Inside are the blood of Heracles and the Golden Fleece (no, it's never explained why they were at the bottom of an American river), which Octopus and Saref want... except they have the wrong chests. The Octopus wants the blood so he can become a god, and Saref wants the Fleece because... it's ""the shiny thing to end all shiny things,"" and apparently women are magpies. But the Spirit -- upset that is first love is seemingly in league with the Octopus -- is determined to bring them both in.

The big problem with ""The Spirit"" is that FRANK MILLER IS NOT A DIRECTOR -- he doesn't know how the film medium works, how to plot a film, or what simply won't work. As a result, the plot is both too simplistic and too complicated, and dialogue is blandly stereotypical at best (""Spirit, we're two of a kind, you and me!"") and just cringeworthy at worst (""I'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead!"").

Aside from the ineptitude... it's ""just plain damn weird."" It feels like Miller was just throwing everything he likes into this movie, whether it fit or not. The tone veers between farce (""Toilets are always funny""), dark comedy, noir (complete with an awful inner monologue), romance, a goofy Tarantino mashup...... except none of it works. The comedy isn't funny (ENOUGH WITH THE EGG JOKES!), it's too superficial to be noir, and the Spirit is too much of a slut for a romance. And the

And then there's the misogyny. Frank Miller is notorious for objectifying every single woman he's ever written about -- so we get an endless parade of skimpily-attired gorgeous women, whose sole characteristic IS their beauty and sexual appeal. And all of them are panting after the Spirit. Even DEATH is personified as a woman who practically has sex with the Spirit when he almost dies!

Gabriel Macht is almost mesmerizingly bad here -- wooden and charmless, always speaking in a flat gravelly voice that sounds like Christian Bale's Batman trying to sound charming. But to be fair, I don't know whether Miller ordered him to act that way. Also, Eva Mendes is not alluring enough to be a femme fatale. It takes more than being beautiful!

But there are two things that ARE entertaining: Jackson and Johansson. This movie should have been called ""Samuel L. Jackson Goes Off His Meds"" -- Jackson plays the Octopus as a manic weirdo who loves to dress up in silly costumes. And Johansson (who looks like she's mentally rehearsing ""Iron Man 2"" lines) plays the only competent, smart character in the movie, who has to constantly coddle her insane boss to pay off grad school bills. Not kidding!

""The Spirit"" should be considered a cautionary tale about giving complete amateurs a director's chair. The only redeeming part is the ""Crazy Sam Jackson and Scarlett Johansson Show"" -- which left me wishing that the movie were about them.",1365206400,7,3734,4.687022900763359
2389167,4,B000AKB1GW,"I like this movie, just not enough to give it five stars. The acting is decent and the plot is just strange, but if you can get if for under ten bucks then why not.

The story, with its mythology bend and the search for eternal life on one side and the other having a Freudian relationship with the city while being the key to the immortal question makes an escape into the cinema fun.  I mean come on, Sam Jackson dressed as a nazi, now that is gold as it personifies The Octopus' megalomania so well!  It may be PG-13 but there is a twistedness to it.  The imagery is other thing that also plays well with story, very vivid and dramatic.  Same Sin City feel minus the more darker moments but here it works well as it's still takes you on a wild ride.  Also, the sub stories in The Spirit all blend in and out of the central theme where Sin City jumped between parallel situations just to bring it together in the end.  The all-star casting doesn't suck either.  I just found it to be a fun escape.  If I want reality I'll go outside.",1361491200,2,920,4.181818181818182

Add it all up and what you have is a fun show that only gets better with each viewing. If you did not enjoy it the first time around, don't give up on it just yet. Give it another chance and this time try not to take it too seriously and you will enjoy it much better. It's not supposed to be dark and gritty like Sin City is, it's tongue-in-cheek just like the Will Eisner comic books that it is based upon.",1358726400,2,709,4.291044776119403
2389172,1,B000AKB1GW,"This movie may be one of the worst things to exist.  I don't mean that in a good way.

With this movie, we, as intelligent, rational beings have obviously given up on our will to be entertained and/or challenged.  Without that spark of hope that teaches us to enjoy our time here on this planet, our will to survive has also been extinguished.

If there were some cataclysmic nuclear event that wiped out 87% of the world population and the last remaining survivors of this apocalyptic wasteland found 'The Spirit' while scrounging around for the last remnants of a bygone era, hoping for a reason to fight for survival, I guarantee you they would watch 23 minutes of this and immediately give up. Having zombies suck out your eyeballs and radioactivity melting your organs would be better than suffering through this.

Samuel L. Jackson does nothing but scream through the entire movie.  As if screaming makes him intimidating or more evil...or maybe more corny?  I'm not sure what the intent is.  But, that is indicative of the entire movie.  We don't know if it's taking the schlock seriously or if it's just bad without meaning to be.

The story makes no sense...I have read the comic.  I LOVE it. This movie, however, makes the comic seem like 'Moby Dick' and 'War and Peace' combined.  The greatest literature ever written.

The ONLY thing appealing about this movie is Scarlett Johanssen's cleavage.  But, that's what you get in all of her movies so pick one that makes sense.  Stay away from this one if you have one shred of human dignity and don't want to contribute to the inevitable fall of all mankind.  I beg you.",1358467200,4,1627,4.676056338028169

We frequent a local independently owned old style movie house and the staff there felt so bad we were leaving early, they apologized to us! We assured them it wasn't the theater, just the movie and we would be back. The biggest problem was trying to get past the weird annoying narrative and the terrible storyline despite the artistry of the picture. When those elements work against each other, it's tough for the audience to make a connection and keep some level of interest going.

2389181,4,B000AKB1GW,"First off, I have read a fair bit of Will Eisner's ""The Spirit"" comics.  That said, this film was largely misunderstood when it was released.  When it came out, a lot of people were expecting Sin City part deux-- only to find an action comedy with a healthy helping of cheese and wild, dystopian out-of-body experiences.

The ""cheesy quirks"" of the individual characters (Octopus' hatred of all things eggs, Spirit talking to his cats, the constantly changing costumes in the ""villian's lair"") are actually an homage to the ""untouchable"" heroes and wild, untamed villians of the 40's.  In fact, the majority of the ""cheese factor"" was due to the director attempting to fuse a modern setting (hence, cell phones and hi-tech weaponry) with the feel of the 1940's comics and noire film.  In other words, this is a comic book movie that is simultaneously poking tongue-in-cheek fun at comics in general.  Because the film isn't taking itself seriously, the viewer shouldn't either.  If you are looking for an unashamedly fun movie, this is a great one to have.  Probably one of my favorites to this point... unpretentious fun.",1318896000,2,1122,4.930851063829787

He should be ashamed to do this to one of the comics' greatest characters.  A total waste of time;  I couldn't sit through it.  Save your money.  It's not even worth renting.

Despite all of the bad reviews about this, I was turned away because of what others have said about this movie but after having finally sat down to watch it, I have to say that anybody who cannot enjoy a movie that is fun, silly and contains some great, talented actors and actresses, needs to take a careful look in the mirror and stop over-analysing each movie as if it's some heavy Oscar contender for a drama award. The one thing this movie won't win is an award, but, that doesn't mean it's not a good movie.

Upon watching this movie, I was reminded of those old pulp comics from the 20's, 30's and 40's, where you had such pulp heroes like Dick Tracy, The Shadow, and yes, even The Spirit. Samuel Jackson was perhaps only one of the many talented actors who actually looked like he was having a lot of fun with his character, The Octopus. I cannot remember the last time when I watched a movie with Samuel Jackson in it and how his character was always this serious, unfunny character. The highlight of the movie was that Mr. Jackson never once took his character seriously and that's the biggest asset in this movie.

Then, when you have such talented cast as Dan Lauria, Eva Mendes and Scarlet Johanson ... you simply cannot go wrong. It was so refreshing to see a movie based on a comic book character, that took on the very characteristics portrayed in its original source material.

Would I recommend this movie? Well, if you're not looking for a serious movie and would like to sit down and watch a fun movie where even the main characters don't take themselves seriously, then you've found the right movie. Gabriel Macht is perfect as ""The Spirit"" and he coomes off like some gigolo but I have to say that the best parts of the movie are the ones with Gabriel Macht and with Samuel Jackson. Even the beginning of the movie is hilarious because of the battle between ""The Spirit"" (Gabriel Macht) and ""The Octopus"" (Samuel Jackson) will surely have you laughing.

It wouldn't stop, it just kept droning on and on, yap yap yap.  Never has so much been said without actually saying anything even remotely intelligent or witty (I would have settled for just plain informative!).  What a crazy way to start a movie, a guy on a roof waxing poetic about HIS city.  Then there was the lengthy flashback that immediately derailed the narrative; teen angst can be so boring, especially when involving two unappealing twerps.  I have to admit, I waited impatiently for the story to evolve.  I waited in vain.  Stilted dialog, marginal performances by everyone, a five minute premise stretched and padded with needless filler...what this movie really needed was a good edit (whittling off 108 minutes would have worked wonders).

But I also believe that Miller wanted that the spectator considered it really strange, in a way like the first readers of the Spirit back in the thirties felt when they read the comics page with the revolutionary hero ""The Spirit""; so different from all other characters of that time.

Some elements of the BD are there, including the beautiful, powerful ladies like Sand (Eva Mendes - unbelievably gorgeous) or silken floss (Scarlett Johansson); the ""noir"" environment and mood; the spankings the poor Spirit (Gabriel Macht) suffer through the entire story (fortunately he's a tough guy).

The story in itself involves mythical artifacts related with the Argonauts, first loves, quest for immortality...I don't reveal more - if you want to know - watch the movie.

Beware! If you don't like stylized films, anachronisms (you will find elements of every decade since the thirties till the present day), character interpretations so that they look like BD characters (including the typical poses ""for the picture"" and exaggerations), you probably won't enjoy the show.

What you will find is a superb work with color, lighting, angles, scenario and visual adaptations from an art form to another and some comedy elements that are quite funny. Did I mention that it has beautiful ladies? Including Eva Mendes?

The Extras are quite good and include a ""making of"", an excellent ""Miller on Miller"" with the history of BD and the huge relevance of Will Eisner, alternate ending and trailer.

2389196,4,B000AKB1GW,this is one of those rare Gems of a movie made for those hip enough to get that it puts the comic back into the comic book movie. i have shown this movie to all my associates and a few of them think this is better than sin city which they found way too dark and depressing. this movie is a parody of the superhero genre just like the spirit comic of the 1940s was a parody before parodies were cool. ultimately why i think there are so many bad reviews of this movie is because of mishandled marketing. the spirit was marketed as the next sin city so when people went into the theatres expecting a dark and violent superhero movie what they got instead was the superhero whose pants are liable to fall down at any moment. the truth is that the spirit was always a comic hero not a dark and gritty vigilante. i would put the Spirit up there with Jim Carrey's the Mask. if you want a movie with smoking hot babes and an extra dose of cartoon violence i would recommend the spirit wholeheartedly. if you want dark and gritty comic book noir grab sin city instead ok?,1282262400,3,1063,4.215686274509804

Frank Miller is no less a towering talent in the field of comic books, and after the successful transition of his ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>"" stories to the big screen, the idea of Miller writing and directing ""The Spirit"" had to seem like a good thing.  Unfortunately, that turns out not to be the case, and more is the pity because the Spirit certainly deserves better.  This has to qualify as one of the most disappointing comic book adaptations of all time and as soon as I say that I try to figure out what I would put at the top of that list, which is hard because it has to be one I don't own and I have to admit ""The Spirit"" is better than ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" ""Supergirl,"" and ""Steel.""  I also have to admit that I my affection for Lea Thompson and the title song she sings at the end means I am one of the few sentient beings who does not have ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-the-Duck/dp/B001MWUWU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard the Duck</a>"" on their short list of horrible comic book movies and apparently everybody hates ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B0007P0Y7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>"" more than I did.

This is a movie where the characters matter more than the plot.  On one side in Central City, we have the Spirit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gabriel-Macht/dp/B0007Q6VY6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gabriel Macht</a>), his cop friend, Detective Sussman (Dan Gerrity), Police Commissioner Dolan (Dan Lauria), and his daughter, Dr. Ellen Dolan (Sarah Paulson), who also happens to be the Spirit's gal.  On the other side we have the Spirit's arch-nemesis, the Octopus (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samuel-L-Jackson/dp/0780618548/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samuel L. Jackson</a>), his accomplice Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson), and his cloned henchmen, Ethos, Pathos and Logos (Louis Lombardi).  In between is the beautiful and mysterious Sand Saref (Eva Mendes), who turns out to have her own connection to Denny Colt, the boy who grew up to become the Spirit.  As for the plot, well, basically the Octopus is plotting to become a god and the Spirit tries to stop him, while dealing with a prospective love triangle.

""Sin City"" had&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marv/dp/1593072945/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marv</a>, magnificently played by Mickey Rourke; ""The Spirit"" does not have any character like Marv, or, for that matter, like Hartigan or Dwight or Nancy or Kevin or basically anybody else you want to mention.  This 2008 movie does have a pretty good cast, but the characters are closer to being one dimensional than three dimensional.  Macht makes virtually no impression at all as the Spirit and the rest of the cast strive to be cartoonish, which means their talents are basically wasted.  The characters that Eisner created simply have not been translated to the screen.  To add insult to injury, this might be the worst movie Samuel L. Jackson has ever been in; you might have expected me to say ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Blue-Sea/dp/B00002E233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Blue Sea</a>,"" but that turkey at least had Jackson's outrageous death scene that had me burst out laughing at its sheer audacity.  There is nothing in this movie to redeem it.

More importantly, Miller does ""The Spirit"" in the same cinematic style as ""Sin City,"" which means that things are black and white whenever possible.  Miller shot his movie on a soundstage in front of green screens with pretty much everything but actors and props generated by computers.  But if Miller's ""Sin City"" is hard core film noir, ""The Spirit"" is decidedly soft core in comparison, so this approach ends up being inappropriate.  This movie needed its own visual style, something more like Miller's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>"" than ""Sin City.""

2389198,2,B000AKB1GW,"I had wanted to see this movie when it was theatrically released, and I'm glad I didn't.

I have never read the Will Eisner comic, so I can't say how accurate an adaptation this is to the book. I did read a lot of Frank Miller's writings and associated artwork in the 80's.  That said, Frank Miller does know about visuals.

The plot involves the Spirit, who is a Batman type of superhero in today's society, but look of the forties; his rivalry with arch-enemy the Octopus, and a long lost love. During the course of his war with the Octopus, he is in self-examination, trying to understand how he died and came back to life.

The movie is visually stunning and the use of shadows is great. The tongue and cheek dialogue amidst a dark background was a good touch...up to a point.  Somewhere along the line, the dialogue went from tongue and cheek to camp, and the camp just seemed out of place for this film. I was enjoying the film, and then it switched to over the top campiness.  And I could not adjust to this new approach. And, though enjoyable, I wasn't thinking it was a great film to begin with.

For all the computer enhanced background, the plot was satisfactory, and the acting was good, but the pace was kind of slow. True film noir might have a slow pace, but it is not boring because they utilize suspense. I didn't find anything in this film suspenseful. And overall, it wasn't funny enough to be enjoyed as a comedy.",1275782400,,1433,4.40530303030303

2389201,1,B000AKB1GW,"First off, I have to say that I am a comic book reader and a superhero fan. I really like how the characters from some of my favorite comics, have been able to explode off the pages and on to the silver screen. Most times, I usually get a bit of a thrill seeing these characters brought to life. Then, however, there are times like when I watched ""The Spirit"" and wish they never would have left those four-color magazines.

Everything about this film is just wrong. The acting, the directing, the script, even the casting. It is flawed on almost every possible level a film can be. Gabriel Macht's performance in the title role is flat and completely uninspired. You can tell he was just phoning it in. Scarlett Johansson is totally wasted in her role, which was so superfluous, that she'd have been better off just not showing up on the set. Sam Jackson plays Sam Jackson, even though they call him ""the Octopus."" It's the same character he's been playing ever since ""Pulp Fiction,"" and it's no longer entertaining (especially in a script this poor). Eva Mendes brings a little bit of sizzle and sexual intensity to things, but she's spends very little time on screen and simply cannot save this heaping pile of garbage.

The script is utter nonsense. I can't even really tell you what the story here is. Something about Sam Jackson out to get the blood of a Greek hero, so he can become immortal, or something. Even by the standards of a comic book script, this thing lacks anything to remotely make it understandable. The action is very cartoony, in that bad kind of way. The dramatic moments (or what passes for them) are so overwrought with clichs and ham-fisted in the delivery, that it seems more like a comedic farce. And while I have enjoyed much of Frank Miller's comic work over the years, he simply is abysmal as a film director. Where is the direction in this movie? Where is the talent we know he possesses? Directors are supposed to help their cast pull forth great performances from within them. There is none of that here. It seems everyone was just there to collect their check, the director included.

The visual styling is nice and noir-ish. It is the one area the film produced anything of value. But after having seen it in ""Sin City,"" ""300"" and other films of late, it's not really special anymore and can't prop up the fact that everything else about this movie stinks on ice. So, it's attempts to distract you from a lack of plot, strong performances and any real thrills, ultimately fails, like everything else in this turkey.

""The Spirit"" is the kind of travesty that sets back comic related films 40 years. It is an amateurish production all the way through. It isn't faithful to the source material, nor is it entertaining in its own right. It doesn't even have the benefit of being ""so bad it is good"" in that cheesy way. Comic fans won't like this. Non-comic fans won't like this. It is truly a film without a valid audience. Everyone involved in this steaming pile of manure should be ashamed of themselves. Do yourself a big favor and avoid this trash and see a GOOD comic book related movie, like ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight,"" because the screams of the city are all coming from those who have watched this egregiously insulting piece of celluloid! It is easily one of the worst comic-related films of all-time.",1272585600,,3350,4.587646076794658

2389203,3,B000AKB1GW,"This movie got some pretty horrible press.  That said, I still liked it.

The first thing you need to understand is that The Spirit is completely silly.  It's campy.  So if you go in expecting a serious action movie in the vein of Sin City, you will be disappointed.  The visual style is full-on Frank Miller and it is beautiful.  He is a master of using color and contrast to create striking scenes.  The visual art is easily the best thing about the film.  It's worth watching just for that, if you're into that sort of thing.

The story isn't the greatest ever written, but I still found it interesting to find out how The Spirit and The Octopus can beat the crap out of each other and still be fine afterward.  The characters are stock but entertaining because they are really caricatures of typical movie roles.  I particularly enjoyed Scarlett Johansson's character as Samuel Jackson's criminal sidekick.

I feel this movie got a bum rap.  Pick up a copy for rent, go into it expecting silliness, and I think you will have a good time.",1267574400,5,1041,4.532258064516129
2389204,3,B000AKB1GW,"Frank Miller's ""The Spirit"" overdoses on style but undernourishes on story.  This is especially strange because Mr. Miller repeatedly emphasizes the importance of story in the generous number of special features on the one-disc edition of the standard DVD I watched.

I can see why Mr. Miller used an amped-up version of the visual style of ""Sin City"" (co-directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez) for this film, a combination film noir and heroic adventure, as the original comic book version of ""The Spirit"" was often very ""out there"" visually.  And the visual style of the movie would have been fine if it also emulated the comic book's solid noir storytelling.  But instead it took the sometimes crazy, goofy scenes from the comic book and made a whole movie out of them, mostly ignoring the subtle, lyrical flavor that was also a big part of Will Eisner's Spirit tales.  And without a solid, engaging story with real emotional underpinnings, the visual style just came off as shrill.

If Mr. Miller (or someone else) wants to take a stab at another movie about Will Eisner's famous urban crimefighter, who looks sort of like a 1950's-era Clark Kent with a Lone Ranger mask, I'd advise them to relax a little and concentrate on telling a solid urban crime tale and not worry about constant action and jokes and sarcasm.  Keep the stylized visuals, but just have them serve a story that actually makes you forget the visuals (at least a little) and worry about the characters.

""The Spirit"" looks terrific on standard DVD, and- as previously mentioned- features a fair amount of special features on the single-disc version of the film I watched, including lots of interview material with director and famed comic book artist Frank Miller (including a commentary track).  Even though I wasn't crazy about the movie, it was great to listen to Mr. Miller's stories and views about the comics industry and working in the movies.

Unless you're a huge fan of this film, I'd say this less expensive single-disc version of the movie will probably suit most people- even Frank Miller fans going back to his earliest comic book days- just fine.  You get a lot of stuff in addition to the movie.

In the end, ""The Spirit"" is watchable and occasionally fun.  But considering the pedigree of the source material, it could have been so much better.",1266796800,3,2343,4.8275

The women in the Spirit are very much like their inspiration in the original Will Eisner comics. There are stand out performances from Eva Mendez, who vamps it up and is completely engaging in the role. Scarlett Johannsen, equally charismatic plays it samart and funny. Samuel L Jacksons Octopus is a ton of fun, and Jackson fans will love it. Gabriel Macht does a great job in the title role. Hardcore Spirit fans will be disappointed he doesnt wear his trademark blue suit. Miller is able to explain this in the extra features, and in the commentary.

Black and white animation combined with some color and partially scenes using real actors requires an enormous amount of new technological advance in art. After watching it 3 or 4 times I finally understood who the Spirit's girlfriend was -- the city. I always thought the country and nature to be beautiful and could not understand how anyone could think the city was beautiful to some people. I guess one becomes accustom to that which one grew up as a child which is familiar to them. This theme has been in other movies as well such as 'Nine Lives'. As a child comic books were like the funny papers -- funny. This movie puts comic back into mix of hero movies which seemed to have died. There is also no shortage of beautiful women such as Eva Mendes, Sarah Paulson and Scarlett Johansson and stupid muscle men.

2389214,1,B000AKB1GW,"I am a great fan of the work of Will Eisner and mainly, The Spirit. In fact, The Spirit was first comic that I collected from first to last number that was published in Mexico in the end of the 70's.

When I know about the intentions to make a film on The Spirit character and mainly, that this was going to be directed by Frank Miller, I supposed that finally it would give a worthy tribute to Eisner and to his better work.

I went to the premiere of the film in Mexico and frankly, it was a brutal deception. I do not know if the intention of Mr. Miller or the producers were to make a sequel of Sin City (that aesthetically, is an excellent film) or what, but as for me, these ARE NOT the Spirit that we know on the comics. The film struggles with a weak insipid script trying to capture the black (and sometimes) cryptic humor of the original comic book and a really bad buch of actors (includes a totally numb and loose Samuel L. Jackson) in the leftovers of the special effects of Sin City.

Ok, Sin City was a landmark in the way to drive the aesthetic and graphic language of the comic books to the movies and mostly being respectful with the whole concept. In the case of The Spirit, it didn't happen, first of all, because the script betray the concept, the characters history and only remains the ""humor"" translated to a mind numbing endless dialogues.

The film is haunted by a bad story, really bad story, long periods of nothing happening, stereotypical characters, lack of character depth and development, making not much sense, over acting in the extreme, and seeming like a parody/satire although it's trying to be serious. You don't really know whether to cringe your toes in sheer embarassment on behalf of the otherwise so brilliant Frank Miller, or laugh your head off.

There are good things about the film though. It is visually very stunning, if a bit too reminiscent of ""Sin City"". There are some quite clever scenes, which makes it rather amusing at times, as for example the samurai scene, in which the bad guys (being lead by Samuel Jackson) are all dressed up like samurais, or indeed the nazi scene, in which the bad guys are dressed as nazis. The final showdown takes you back to ""Hot Shots part Deux"", or some such thing, and you don't know... well, anything, really.

I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are a bunch of lads with a fridge full of beer and nothing else to do. Then you can watch it as a piece satire and laugh and laugh and laugh.

2389217,3,B000AKB1GW,"This is SOOOO not like the strip itself in feel. Will Eisner's ""The Spirit"" was an original handling of the whole ""Shadow""/""Batman""/""Dick Tracy"" ""creature of the night"" crimefighter. The opening splash panels were always so elaborate and illustrative. The Spirit always showed a ton of compassion to his retrievable charges, like Bleak or Sand Serif, (Sand actually being an old childhood friend of his!) but the one antagonist he has that he doesn't show ANY  compassion for, the Octopus, played by Samuel L. Jackson, doing his crazy coon routine again, is trying to become immortal by acquiring a serum that will grant him that power from Spirit's old childhood chum, Sand Serif, who has become Modesty Blaise, after a fashion.

The Spirit is Denny Colt, a rookie cop that is killed, but then brought back to life somehow to become the bane of the human vermin in his city. He works in concert with the chief of police, Dolan, and dates his daughter, Ellen. Dolan is not like the strip Dolan. Ellen is not like the strip Ellen. There's a new character that I never saw before, Morgenstern, who plays a Jimmy Olsen type role here. She's more or less just competent comedy relief.

The strip this movie is based on is as old as the hills....going back to the forties, and was originally issued as its own individual supplement as part of Sunday papers every week, until austerity programs got it canceled in that venue. Zip to the early seventies, and publisher James Warren, he of ""Creepy"", ""Eerie"" and ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"", falls in love with the strip and publishes ""Spirit"" magazine , a compendium of new stories drawn by Mike Ploog and written by Eisner. Actually, if you ask me, it took WAAAAAY too long for this property to be made into a live-action feature. I wonder what held it up.

This is not the first media version of The Spirit, either. Not long ago, (1987,) there was a TV movie done by the Fox network or someone adventurous, and THAT one missed the mark as well! At least they didn't have a version of Ebony in this new one. No, just the Octopus to perpetuuate an unfortunate ethnic stereotype.

Anyway....it could have been worse....there ARE some funny bits in here. The Octopus' cloned henchman are funny, as are some scenes with them and Scarlett Johannson. However, the feel of the old srip just isn't there, and whoever put Gabriel Macht in sneakers and a trench coat ought to be shot! And what is it with Frank Miller and near-monochromatic cinematography?? His D.O.P shoots too damned dark and drab for a lot of the movie to be enjoyed completely.

I always approach a movie I haven't seen as a blank slate, perhaps a little hard to do with Eisner's storytelling in mind. I came away pleased, but a bit disappointed. Frank Miller and his production crew managed to capture some of the quirky humor and the film noir feel of Eisner's comic, but some of the strong sense of morality: of strong heroes working for justice and criminal masterminds who still have a touch of humanity hidden away, some of that felt a bit missing. I love the black and white with touches of color, brought in from Miller's Sin City, but somehow it doesn't quite fit Eisner's creation.

It's uneven, yes, but it's nowhere as bad as some have made it out to be. I had fun watching it, it was entertaining; it could have been better, and it may not have fully captured the spirit of Eisner's work, but it was definitely worth the time to watch it.",1249603200,5,1462,5.0875

The movie didn't work for me on any level.  Miller attempted to make it campy like the old Batman TV series of the sixties. It doesn't work!

2389222,2,B000AKB1GW,"When I first heard that Frank Miller was going to direct an adaptation of Will Eisner's 'The Spirit' for the big screen, I was very excited. I'm a huge fan of both Will Eisner and Frank Miller, and have had the great honor of meeting them both. IMO The Spirit was some of the best comics ever made, and having read the book 'Eisner/Miller' (a book of conversations between the two creators), I knew that Miller had enormous respect for the original material.

 However, Miller has never been one to ape anyone's style, even when paying homage to them. Miller has his own very strong and unique style, and that's what he brought to this adaptation...the end result has very little to do with Eisner's Spirit, and much more to do with Miller's dark vision. Even the logo of the movie looks as though it was scrawled by Miller's own hand, with no hint of the famous, distinctive Spirit logo which Eisner created, which the character has been identified with for many decades.

 Miller's love of the film noir genre permeates SIN CITY and this film as well. He was creating comics inspired by film noir before he was ever even hired by Marvel, going way back to his APA 5 days. Eisner's Spirit stories were noir as well, but at the same time were often lighthearted. Miller  seemed to try to evoke some of that feel with some overly-camp dialogue at times, but it didn't quite work for me. (when Miller tries to inject humor into this material, it comes across as rather awkward, and just plain weird at times).

I must admit, a lot of this film didn't work for me, which is bizarre when you consider that I'm a huge Spirit fan, a Miller fan, a film noir buff, Samuel Jackson is among my favorite actors, and I can't get enough of Eva Mendes or Scarlett Johansson. This film is filled with beautiful women, and highly-stylized eye candy abounds throughout this film...however I found a lot of the dialogue very hackneyed and tiresome, especially midway through the movie.

I really wanted to like this film, and its an oddity worth seeing if you are a comics fan. I'm sure I would've enjoyed it more if it had nothing to do with Eisner's Spirit, because it really didn't capture much of the classic comic series at all (and some of it, such as Commissioner Dolan's attitude towards the Spirit was the OPPOSITE of how Eisner always portrayed it, which was disconcerting).

If this had been a new character that Miller had created, I wouldn't have had so many preconceptions, and it wouldn't have disappointed me so much. In fairness to Miller, no comic creator other than Eisner himself has ever really successfully portrayed the Spirit in comics (Darwyn Cooke's run on the character was good, but Eisner was the Orson Welles of comics, and no one can match him). Now if they could just get Miller to direct a Batman movie, his style would be perfect for that....",1247443200,,2858,4.590196078431372

What's amazing is that even though Frank Miller is a capable director with a good eye (just look at his comics and you can see that) where he falls down is in his other skill: the writing.

Now, Frank Miller has written some terrific stuff, but here... I don't know what happened. It's like he couldn't decide what he wanted the movie to be. It looks like the 1940's, except people have cell phones.

Pros-
Eve Mendes and Scarlett Johnansson were smoking hot and Samuel L Jackson did a decent job as The Octopuss but it's the same old shtick for him.

It was Sin City but only tamer.

Gabriel Macht did do a good job as The Spirit. The only acting I felt weak was those stupid bad guys.

Cons-
PG-13 really hurt the film. A good PG-13 can contain a few curse words and some great action, this film lacked both.

Alot of weird stuff going on that make you go huh

Overall, i'd diffently welcome a sequel but that probably will never happen. This rarely ran in theaters and I don't think many people know it exist. If you do see a copy of the film in a bargain bin within a year, I'd check it out.",1244246400,,883,3.9886363636363638

Then it dawned on me, everyone kept telling me it was not as good as 300 or Sin City. I finally rented it and I can honestly say it was excellent. The film from beginning to end was beautifully done; all the visuals were eye candy and fascinating.

I think the film loses the possible merit it could have had because it was marketed so strongly with Frank Millers previous connections to 300 and Sin City. Both of which were very dark stories.

The Spirit is a dark story with a tongue in cheek attitude that does not take itself too serious.

That is what I found so amazing about the film. Frank Miller's ability to capture the gritty action of a crime noir adventure while controlling the cheese factor results in a solid and balanced movie.

I also have not followed any of Will Eisner's original Spirit comics so my opinion of the cast's portrayal of the characters is based solely on their performances within the film. Of which were excellent, especially front man Gabriel Macht's performance as The Spirit.

This is Frank Millers first feature length debut film and I am thoroughly looking forward to his future works.

All in all I would say to approach this movie with an open mind and not to compare it to Sin City or 300. You'll be in for a surprise that is fresh, different, and enjoyable.",1243728000,12,1396,4.54183266932271

Blame it on Hollywood for promoting this as a ""from the makers' of Sin City and 300"" movie.

It was exactly what it was supposed to be and I'm proud of them for making it that way instead of selling out to the majority.

2389241,2,B000AKB1GW,"I have to say that I've been a fan of The Spirit and artist Will Eisner for a long time.  I bought a lot of reissues of The Spirit and I've read most of Eisner's graphic novels.  This is not Will Eisner's Spirit.  This film is Frank Miller's updated version of The Spirit.  I say this because the only people who seem to like this film are fans of the original comic, but I am one who did not like the film.

On the positive side, the look of the film is great.  Miller has accurately captured the look of Eisner's comics.  Gabriel Macht (the Spirit) and Sarah Paulson (Ellen Dolan) are well cast.  The special effects are mostly excellent, with the exception of the opening credit sequence, which to me was completely unbelievable and unrealistic.  Louis Lombard is likable as the cloned idiot helper to The Octopus and Silken Floss.  I liked Eva Mendes as Sand Saref, although I appear to have a minority opinion on that.

The mediocre - Sam Jackson as The Octopus.  Jackson gives a typical over the top cartoony performance just like he does in every film.  This either works for you or it doesn't.  A more nuanced actor like Laurence Fishburne would have been a better choice, but Jackson does bring some real menace to the role and it's not his fault that the film is bad.  However, a different approach certainly could have helped to elevate the film a little, but given the film's many flaws, that wouldn't have saved it.  Miller's constant use of snow as a motif didn't work for me.  Rain can work well in films.  Snow is not as good.

The bad - Pretty much everything else, especially the script.  The production company's eyes no doubt lit up when Miller expressed an interest in doing the film.  After hitting home runs with 300 and Sin City, this had to look like money in the bank.  Miller was a big fan of Eisner and he seemed to everyone, including me, to be the perfect choice.  His direction is mostly fine, but the script, which he wrote, is just awful.  Miller makes people say things that are completely out of character, to me as a long time fan, with how things were in the comic.  His approach seems to simply be to have everyone cuss a lot to make it ""modern"".  Some of the dialog is just laughably bad.  It's clear that nobody associated with the production had the good sense to demand a re-write of the script prior to filming as that might have saved the film.  Want to play a drinking game?  Take a drink every time Commissioner Dolan (played by Dan Lauria) says the same curse word and you'll be drunk by the time the film is over.  Dolan's dialog is so bad, frankly it stood out the few times he didn't say curse.  Lauria was given trash material to work with, no doubt, but he does nothing to elevate himself above it.  Miller's script also introduces too many female characters from the comics who simply detract from the film.  Lorelei Rox and Plaster Of Paris add little to the film, although that's not the fault of the actresses.  Scarlett Johansson seems miscast and gives a weak performance as Silken Floss.  At some point before filming started somebody should have said that there were too many characters and too much bad dialog in the script, but they didn't and this mess is what you see.

I have believed for years that The Spirit has the potential to be a great movie, but it's going to take someone else to make that happen, if it ever does.  If Eisner were alive, I do not think he would be pleased with this.  I give it 2 stars only because the visuals work and Gabriel Macht is fine as The Spirit.  Some people seem to think that this may be the worst film ever made and while I would not go that far, I can understand why they think so.

2389243,2,B000AKB1GW,"After the huge cinematic success of the adaptations of ""Sin City"" and ""300"", comic book writer Frank Miller (also wrote the graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"") was given a blank check to make ANY movie he wanted. Miller wasn't exactly given enough credit for his involvement in the directorial duties of ""Sin City"". This caused Robert Rodriguez to resign from the DGA when the Guild refused to give Miller credit as co-director. Miller made the layouts and breakdowns for the graphic novels from which both films were HUGELY based on and therefore made the storyboards in a sense--it would be right for him to have some recognition I would think. Well, Miller now directs and writes this adaptation of the comic strip by Will Eisner. My memory of the strip is very blurry and so with this review, I cannot judge this film as to how faithful it would be to the source material. I can still however, say just how good a film it is or how it is in the entertainment value.

A gunned down cop gets resurrected as an impeccably dressed vigilante (with a red tie) called the ""Spirit"" (Gabriel Macht) who protects the crime-laden streets of Central City. He shadows the underworld to stop evil-doers and haunted by the memory of his old flame, Sands Saref (Eva Mendez) who suddenly returns in search of a mythological treasure. A mad genius called the ""Octopus"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and his aide, Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson) are also wreaking havoc in the streets of this dark city in search for the blood of Herakles that they believe is the missing key to immortality. The Spirit becomes ensnared in the web of deceit and manipulations by Saref that puts him right in the middle...

Frank Miller brought the comic book ""Daredevil"" to new heights. Miller also created the groundbreaking graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"". He made the ""noir-ish""  comic series ""Sin City"" and even co-wrote the script for Robocop 2. One wouldn't be hard-pressed to be curious as to how he would fare as director. Well, ""The Spirit"" displays that noir-like comic book feel through and through, with its use of monochromatic color hues and shadowy atmosphere. The film does look fantastic and stylish. The CGI-laden set designs does have that ""mimicry"" of a comic book page. Its cinematography (by Bill Pope) is quite inventive and looks very nifty, and does bring out potentially iconic sequences of comic book heroism in its screenplay. The film is an aural and visual feast for the audience, the problem with the film isn't a shortage on style, it has tremendous problems with discipline.

When making a comic-like experience, one should remember that the goal is to bring the comic book to life. Making it a fantasy made real with material we can relate to. Well, ""The Spirit"" tries to go a different way; it tries to make the cinematic experience a comic book; drenching the screenplay in a comic book tone. While this may not be a bad thing, there is such a thing as overdoing a good thing. The plot in ""The Spirit"" is pretty simple, but the execution is just too overcooked. Miller has a good eye for visuals and therefore his characters have to be different. In a way they are, but the dialogue is just so flat-full of comedic undertones and bizarre behavior driven by ludicrous performances by its cast. Think ""Dick Tracy"" on steroids and ""Sin City"" on morphine and you'll have an idea just how it plays out its directorial sensibility.

The ""Octopus"" proves a very heavy-handed villain with his eye-bulging, overly exaggerated quips. There is one scene where Jackson and Johansson dresses up like Nazis to reveal Octopus' evil plot--the dressing up thing proved totally unnecessary. Saref's little scene when she ""xeroxes"" her bottom is totally pointless except as an exercise on sensuality and a display on large derrieres. I suppose this is all an exercise in comic book fun and style, but it didn't really work for me. I appreciate raw sensuality but this just made no sense. However, I do welcome the scantily-clad attire as displayed with the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Sarah Paulson, Eva Mendez, Jaime King (Sin City) who plays the voluptuous Lorelei, and the awesome outrageous sensuality of Paz Vega as ""Plaster of Paris"" (seriously!). The voluptuous women are a great distraction amid all the messy screenplay.

The action in ""The Spirit"" does retain the ""fist-first"" comic book attitude and tone. Some are cool, while some are outrageously bizarre. It does not have any emotional stakes nor any feelings of intensity, instead it tries to mix in some comedic one-liners that it sours the pace and feel of the action sequences. It fails to connect with any kind of impact except for its visual flair.

""The Spirit"" is a visual marvel and truly is a technical achievement in CGI-generated  environments and style. Unfortunately, the lack of discipline in its direction and the tasteless dialogue makes the film a huge mess. Miller steadily drives his performers to the erroneous track and gives in to comedic characterization that proved annoying. Maybe he was aiming for a surreal, noir-like comedy but it all feels too superficial and ineptly executed. It is Miller's first directorial assignment, and I forgive him for his mistakes. Remember, a comic book adaptation works when its characters have even the smallest impression of reality and emotion on them.

The success of the adaption of Sin City gave Miller some creds to direct his own film (Robert Rodriguez gave him screen credit for directing one of the vignettes) - but what worked for Sin City is not applicable to The Spirit, and implies that Miller is a One Trick Pony.  What I recall of the Spirit is the wonderful primary colors - the blue suit, the red tie, the piercing blue eyes of Denny Colt.  At the end of the film, I could not decide if I'd watched a satire, a comedy or a poorly presented drama.  Probably a bit of all three.  It was advertised as an 'homage' to Will Eisner, but it was more of an insult.

Maybe it was high hopes.  Maybe I was expecting something that clearly this film was not.  I am willing to accept that, on some ground, the failure of this film was my fault.  However, this is a film struggling to find itself.  It shows us a gritty, Sin-City-esque exterior with all the flair of its predecessors, yet manages to go like a bat out of hell in the other direction.  It reminded me of a take on Evil Dead 2.  A movie with the heart of a horror, but was really intended to be a comedy.  It is the only excuse I can find for the inane babble that simply detracts from the overall story and ultimately loses you.  Yet it is the odd costumes and odder characters that makes someone look at the screen in stunned horror.  Clones with their names on their shirts?  Check.  Samuel L Jackson in a fur coat and a pimp hat smashing a toilet over our heros head?  Check.  A full zoot suit with Keds?  Check.

I realize in the end that movies are an art form and frankly, what appeals to one will not appeal to another.  However, that being said, this film fell flat in the first ten minutes and never really rose again.  In the end this film should be rented with caution.  It is either a film you will get or you won't.  And if you don't, no stylish camera work or art work will save it.",1242518400,,1450,4.114695340501792

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Cop (Gabriel Macht) dies, but returns to fight crime in Central City for another day (and another, and so on)
2. Ridiculously campy bad guy ""The Octopus"" (Samuel L. Jackson) claims to have eight of everything, except maybe free range chicken eggs.
3. Criminal seductress Sand Saref (Eva Mendes) hates cops, but just adores bling.
4. Adding two more arms to the Octopus' arsenal is Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson), a scientist described by the henchmen as ""the most beautiful woman ever.""
5. The Police Commissioner's daughter Ellen (Sarah Paulson) is a surgeon who's always willing to do a little spirit-patching.
6. Basically, the movie's about the bad guy and the girls fighting over two extremely valuable items while the hero alternately fights, loves and recuperates, not necessarily in that order.

This star-studded comic book adaptation is recommended for people who like noir, campy humor, graphic novels and the movie ""Sin City"".  Simply described, it's silly and weird, but fun.

2389248,2,B000AKB1GW,"Well... um... wow... this one's tricky.

Clearly this is a movie that either you ""get"" or you don't. I didn't, it's as simple as that. The first fifteen minutes or so made me think that this movie was gonna be pretty good, when I watched the fight scene between the Spirit and the Octopus, but from there things got a little less than perfect.

The characters are all extremely one dimensional, and when I say that I mean that these characters have less depth than ANY other characters I've ever seen in any movie. We have the Spirit, who is basically a womanizer who can't die, we have the female ""one who got away"" concept, who is shallow and basically wants money and money only, and then Octopus, the ""bad guy"" bent on becoming immortal or something along those lines. These three things are basically the only concepts talked about within the dialogue. The movie has been marketed as all edgy and what not with themes about ""breaking all sorts of rules"" but that's not the vibe I got. I got the ""what people really think like this?"" kind of vibe. Someone once said ""To call the characters cardboard would be to insult a decent packing material"" and I see his point exactly.

The action is not terrible, but nothing is outstanding, and the weapons are anything but realistic. Other than that, the plot is just... somehow simple and really weird at the same time. The biggest highlight was watching Samuel Jackson dressed as a Nazi, seeing as Nazi killed black people. Other than that this is... well... bland, I guess is the word for people who ""didn't get it"" like me.",1242172800,2,1573,4.570921985815603

2389250,2,B000AKB1GW,"The Spirit is another comic-book turned movie by Frank Miller.  Using the same style as Sin City, this one focuses on 3 characters; one good, one bad and on one the fence, who deal with each other in a place known as Central City.  Eva Mendes and Samuel Jackson play Sand Saref and the Octopus, two individuals chasing after mythical treasure.  The Spirit is a dead cop come back from the dead who fights crime in the city, and ends up caught between the Octopus and Sand Saref.

The movie came out amid a long and widespread ad campaign, and quickly bombed at the box office and among the critics.  I will try to elucidate the reasons why.  First, it tries to appeal to different audiences, but does not quite succeed.  Though having a film noir style like from the 1940's, the storyline borders on sci-fi fantasy.  Second, there are lots of action scenes using guns, knives and even toilet bowls; but there is really neither OW or WOW in any of them.  Characters looked stunned when they should be in immmense pain, and the color schemes makes the blood look all false.  Third, the ads for the movie heavily emphasized the numerous gorgeous babes starring in it.  However, only one, Eva Mendes, shows any skin.  Jaime King, who plays lady death, could have been presented as a nude spirit waiting in the afterlife; instead we only see her face and upper torso wrapped in blueish-white scarves floating across the screen.  Another letdown was in Scarlett Johannson.  She basically played a nerd in this movie.  The movie makers would have done better having her play the nurse, and putting the older Sarah Paulson as Dr. Octopus's assistant.  Probably the worst acting was in Samuel Jackson's character.  For a man who is famous for his roles playing bad asses (Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, Snakes on a Plane, etc...), this was his cheesiest role ever.  And to conclude, the biggest letdown of the movie was in the dialogue.  For a movie set in an imaginery time in an imaginery city, the dialogue sounded like any other action movie; plain filler between the gunfights.  This is unfortunate as comic-book movies set in imaginary locales offer wonderful opportunities for great, original dialogue.

So overall, this movie is a bust.  The only thing worth watching about it is a 1-second shot of Eva Mendes nude figure.",1241740800,,2315,4.720698254364089

back in the 1940's and for many years later.
The Spirit was always eccentric and not your average story in comics.  This movie tries to stay close to that legacy.  Most of these overly critical people obviously have never read the spirit comic books that are available out there in book form as well.  They bought this expecting 300 or a standard movie superhero, but the spirit was never that.  I love the standard comic heroic figure, but to make the spirit like them would betray what Will Eisner had created.  So Frank Miller deserves kudos for his work on this movie.  It's alot of fun and not for everyone but it shines on blu ray.  The acting is not weak either it's just in line with the Spirit legacy. The picture is excellent and the directing solid as any miller movie, however every miller movie is existing is a strange place that doesn't reflect reality so that's what you get here.

2389258,1,B000AKB1GW,"Frank Miller writing and directing and a big time cast -- what's not to like? Pretty much everything, sadly.

I really love the movie Sin City and found The 300 quite enjoyable the first few times I watched it, so I have been waiting for this on Blu Ray for some time.

Let's start with the positives, because sadly there are few of them. We have a generally first class ensemble of actors, all of who have done credible work in their careers. Given the provenance of this movie, who among them didn't tell their agents to do whatever it took to get them in this movie, because it should have been formidable. We have a rehash of the same animation techniques that were so riveting and plot enhancing in Sin City. Sadly that's about it.

Frank Miller does not seem to understand Directing 101 -- the art of putting a point of interest in the frame and keeping it there. He does not seem to be able to communicate what he wants to his good cast.

We learn at the beginning our hero really loves ""his city""; and at the end, we learn he really loves his city . . . and he's 'the Spirit' of the city. What that means or why he loves it, I haven't a clue, nor is it apparent why he no longer either loves his former wife and current doctor (how does it work out that she sews him up? does she still think he's dead? does the simple mask keep her from telling?) We never can be sure in this muddle. And what about the childhood sweetheart who abandoned our young hero for the fast life of big time theft and multiple marriages? Does our hero still love her? All we know is he loves his city.

This is a movie which simply can't decide whether it's a stylish film noir drama or camp. The characters are constantly interrupted by having to say or react to lines that are clumsy and exactly opposite the emotion the movie has spent the previous 5 minutes laboriously trying to establish. We have a bad guy who dissolves white persian kittens -- how bad is that? In fact, my dog did like the fact there were some many cats in the movie, and she retained her interest better than the rest of the family. Samuel L. Jackson as a Nazi -- what an incredibly far-fetched and bad idea -- with no satisfactory explanation. ""He is what he is.""

Lines are bad, and self-contradicting dialog is sprayed like submachine gun fire. There are ideas which must have been an attempt at parody, but one is too confused and distracted to get them, because one is obsessed ferociously tryng to understand who is doing what to whom and why one should care. To give you an idea of the emotional chasms we are trying to navigate here, imagine Adam West as the Batman in the original Godfather, while Smokey and the Bandit run through it.

While the animation and sets were usefully dark and foreboding in Sin City, in this movie they are ludicrous . . . more like ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", filmed in black, pitch black, dark black, charcoal gray and white. Sin City was actually much more effective in my opinion as animation.

I'm sure there are worse ""big budget"" movies in the past, but it's so hard for me to remember one at the moment. My advice is unless you really know the original material (comic books), take a pass on this film. It's a couple of hours of confusion interrupted by boredom.",1240790400,4,3266,4.342622950819672
2389259,2,B000AKB1GW,"You have to dive deep into suspension of disbelieve waters if you want to enjoy this thing. I believe Frank Miller wanted to issue this film at least R-rated instead of PG-13. Who knows? Perhaps studio executives insisted in a PG-13. Otherwise why blurring Eva Mendes nude (and sooo brief) scene? She is a goddess and I don't see anything wrong in worshipping her beauty. Besides, she's a very good actress. However, this is America and frontal nudity must be forbidden. Otherwise we may find it attractive and become perverted by the devil.

In any case, at times the movie almost makes sense. The excessive violence of the fighting sequences may shock some people, until it's understood that the charcters really don't suffer that much.

Acting is not bad, but something went wrong somewhere with the movie. It could have been good Frank Miller. Instead is awful Frank Miller.",1240790400,,878,4.885906040268456

They all seemed to have high expectations for it and were disappointed. Since I was expecting it to be bad it actually turned out to be enjoyable.

2389263,1,B000AKB1GW,"The Spirit is a classic comic book character that sprung from the imagination of famed comic book writer and artist Will Eisner and is revered by many a comic book fan. ""The Spirit"" is also a recent movie adaptation from writer/director Frank Miller (""Sin City""), and is despised by not only comic book fans, but virtually every other moviegoer that was unlucky enough to believe it looked appealing. So, aside from the obvious difference in mediums, why is one version of this character so much more beloved than the other? My guess is that the biggest faults of this movie lie with the horrible dialogue, sub-par visual effects, over-the-top acting, and an uninteresting storyline. Now I must ask, amongst all of those items what is the common denominator that links them all together? The answer is... the overrated writer and co-director of ""Sin City"", and formerly brilliant comic book writer, Frank Miller.

Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht) used to be one of Central City's finest, patrolling the city to ensure that its citizens were safe from harm. After a gangster's bullet brought the life of Officer Colt to a sudden end, he found himself mysteriously resurrected as the avenging hero known as The Spirit. Now, he must contend with seductive foes such as Sand Saref (Eva Mendes) and Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson), femme fatales who are as dangerous as they are beautiful. As if that wasn't enough to deal with, this new hero must also thwart the nefarious schemes of his archenemy, the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson), before all of Central City is destroyed.

The cast for ""The Spirit"" is led by actor Gabriel Macht (""The Recruit""), a generally solid actor who isn't the most recognizable of talents, yet still delivers on most instances. He's one of those guys that when you see him in a movie you recognize him, but you just can't quite place him exactly. As the Spirit, which I believe to be Gabriel's first true lead role, Gabriel's performance falls prey to what virtually every other member of the cast is guilty of, repeated bouts of wooden acting during many of the monologue-esque moments in the film or overacting in a way that is far too distracting to the point that the character is laughable at best. Granted I believe the script and the direction (Frank Miller's responsible for both) that Gabriel and the entire cast received most likely prompted them to act in those ways, but the end result is extremely detrimental to the movie and any enjoyment I could have derived from it.

Along with Gabriel Macht are several talented actresses, who without a doubt definitely look the parts of female comic book characters. With their voluptuous curves and great beauty, it's as if each of the film's main actresses from Scarlett Johansson (""The Island"") to Eva Mendes (""Ghost Rider"") to Paz Vega (""Spanglish"") could have jumped off the comic book pages themselves or at least served as part of the inspiration for their illustrated counterparts. As far as their performances went, as I said a moment ago, the entire cast suffered from the same problems in their roles, and these ladies are no exception. The only one I can really say stood out a little more than the others would be Eva Mendes, mostly because her character was given the most to do out of all the females, and she seemed to keep her performance as grounded as possible. Truthfully, I must admit that I was a little disappointed in Scarlett's performance, because she seemed to be quite bored in the role during several scenes. She just never really sold her commitment to the character at any point within the film's duration. As for Paz Vega, well she did as good as the others, which obviously isn't saying a whole lot given my complaints about the performances, but her character just didn't have all that much to do in the film. From what I can recall, I really didn't see the need for her character to even be included in the story. Mostly the character felt like she had been wedged in because she probably appeared in the comics, so it was merely a gesture intended to please the fans is my guess.

And last but not least is the almost always enjoyable Samuel L. Jackson as The Spirit's archenemy, The Octopus. Sam's performance here easily ranks as one of his least enjoyable from my perspective, and out of the entire cast he is the worst offender in terms of overacting and cheesiness within a performance. I know Sam sometimes tends to wander towards the over-the-top side of things in his various roles, but this time he really goes overboard, and the character never benefits from the choice at all. Really it didn't feel like he was playing a new character, merely an over-exaggerated version of his celebrity persona, imbuing The Octopus with Sam Jackson-ism's so to speak. As a role it obviously didn't challenge Samuel, but he didn't seem to be trying too hard to improve upon what was given to him either. It's a shame when even someone like Sam Jackson, who is one of my favorite actors, doesn't even give a performance worth talking about or remembering (at least not in a good way).

What is really surprising to me is the fact that so many talented actors and actresses signed on for such a horribly written movie like this. Surely they all, or at least most of them, would have looked at the script first. Did no one catch on to how horribly written this snore-fest was? Speaking of the story not only does it feature some extremely bland moments of dialogue, but numerous times throughout the film the story barely ever makes sense. There were times where a plot point was being discussed, then out of nowhere the topic is changed to something pointless, and the plot never gets readdressed. I guess Frank Miller just assumed that we wouldn't notice that the plot just skips around without ever fully fleshing out the different points. Perhaps he was trying to go for some kind of record in movies for the most instances of pointless conversations within a single film or just trying to get noticed for making one of the most incoherent pieces of cinema to hit the big screen in quite some time.

Another problem with the story was that believability was stretched far too thin, even for a comic book movie. It is one thing to deal with super-powered beings, aliens, or any other science fiction related item, those things can be accepted if the audience is aware that that is the kind of movie they are watching. However to have a comic book movie that doesn't really deal in the arena of sci-fi all that much, yet have it still push the envelope in terms of believability is quite surprising. For instance, how many different guns can The Octopus pull out of his fur coat? I know from watching ""The Matrix"" that a person can strap a shockingly large amount of guns to their person; however, the amount and sheer size of the weapons The Octopus pulls out in some scenes is a little too extreme given that he was supposedly hiding them all under his coat. It was just so ridiculous to watch that it made me question my sanity for even sitting through the entire film. Perhaps a little more of a grounded sense of reality could have strengthened this film's story just a little bit, it still wouldn't have made it a great movie, but at least it would have been more bearable to watch.

Finally, I must take some time to touch upon one of the biggest eye sores within the film, the visual effects employed to create the backgrounds for virtually every single frame of the movie. I know that Frank Miller was trying to recreate a look and feel similar to what he and co-director Robert Rodriguez had captured on ""Sin City"". This was a decent idea, not very original, and in the end seemed like Miller was more interested in making another ""Sin City"" movie rather than one based on The Spirit. Beyond all that is the fact that the budget for ""The Spirit"" must have been considerably less than that of ""Sin City"" or ""300"", for that matter. I say this because almost every scene reeks of CGI created or enhanced backgrounds, and for the most part they all look extremely fake and poorly rendered. If you are going to make a film using this method of filmmaking, then perhaps you should either have the proper amount of funding or be sure your visual effects house can handle the workload to produce a quality result that can at least meet, if not exceed today's audience expectations.

In the end, ""The Spirit"" is a terrible movie that is full of cheesy one-liners, an abundance of wooden and/or over-the-top performances, shoddy effects work, not to mention a generally unexciting story making it one of the weakest comic book adaptations I have ever seen. This film was so bad that it may actually give ""Catwoman"", ""Howard the Duck"" or ""Supergirl"" a run for their money in being the absolute worst adaptation ever. For any directors or producers out there in Hollywood who may be wishing to make a comic book film adaptation, please take note of this movie, because this is essentially a lesson on what not to do.

""The Spirit"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.",1240617600,9,9086,4.680851063829787

2389265,4,B000AKB1GW,"A minor character in this film, and the great visuals,  made this movie fun for me. I laughed every time Louis Lombardi was on screen, usually as two or three people (twins or clones), although with a different name on the front of his tee-shirt.

  At first, I thought it was the last guy to play ""Curly"" of the Three Stooges. Then, it dawned on me: it was Lombardi, who played ""Edgar Stiles"" on the TV hit ""24."" Well, those of you who have seen this film know what I'm talking about. Lombardi's characters will have you either hysterical or thinking ""how stupid is this?"" I guess you could say the same for much of the film. It seems to be either great or terrible, depending on what scene you're viewing.

""Over-the-top"" is a good description of this film. That's not necessarily an insult, as the film is another of these comic-book-come-to-life films that are supposed to be wild-looking stories and visuals. To me, the visuals were a real treat, but I expected that bold black-and-white ""Sin City"" look. It didn't disappoint in that area.  The DVD looks astounding!

The characters in the film are all - repeat ""all"" - over-the-top, but that creates a lot of fun. You can't take one scene here seriously.  That's the key - take the movie as a joke, and nothing more because it's not easy to stay with the story. Something is missing - maybe caring more for the characters, or a story that's a little too rough and disjointed in spots for mainstream audiences. Maybe it's the hero's inspiration. He says does what he does because he ""loves the city,"" loves the grime, dirt and buildings. It's tough to warm up to that.

All-in-all, it's still pretty good entertainment, especially if you are into great-looking visuals and wacko characters. Just don't expect this to be any award-winner.",1240617600,,1792,4.663492063492064
2389266,2,B000AKB1GW,"THE SPIRIT is beautiful, flat-out elegant in spots.  It's engaging to watch, eye-catching scenes piled up on top of each other.  Some of them are even pure fun: the early fight scene between the Spirit and the Octopus is intense, suspenseful, and funny at the same time.

The problem is, THE SPIRIT is too humorous.  In some spots, the humor is intentional, and dead-on; I laughed out loud, and in other spots chuckled, just as the filmmakers intended.  In other spots, however, the humor is unintentional, and it's hard to tell what THE SPIRIT is aiming for (at times it seems like flat-out parody).  Miller piles upon heaps of beautiful women, who add little to the film except some campy fun (it's kind of depressing to see such a talented actress like Scarlett Johansson reduced to strutting about in a nurse outfit, snarling aggressively for no reason except atmosphere).  Samuel L. Jackson is fun to watch as always; he's the sole source of energy in this picture, the King of Camp, if I may coin a phrase.  Gabriel Macht, as the titular hero, doesn't seem to know what to do with himself; it's a shame, because there was such possibility in him to create an interesting and enigmatic character.  Instead, he seems caught between directorial instructions--being a dashing hero and a comedic caricature.

Such is the overall impression of Frank Miller's THE SPIRIT.  Miller obviously has a strong visual sense--he's shown it in his graphic novels, in the films he's does, and even here.  However, the writing isn't as strong as one would expect; the film isn't ground breaking, like 300 or SIN CITY (both of which had Miller's comics as source material; Miller even co-directed the latter).  THE SPIRIT is merely a poor re-hash of those two films, a wannabe, which is a shame, since it's in the hands of such a talented visual artist.",1240444800,,1839,4.781645569620253

So why do a lot of people dislike this film? Well, everybody who watched this film (including myself) came with the expectations that although it would be based on The Spirit comic, that it would as well be dark and intense like Sin City (watch the trailers and you'll understand what I mean). When we found out it was acting like a 40's comic (which the Spirit is I might add!) many were disappointed, but many such as myself were able to enjoy it anyway.

So PLEASE have the right expectations. And enjoy!",1240272000,3,647,4.521367521367521
2389268,1,B000AKB1GW,"On paper, it sounds great -- Frank Miller directing an adaptation of ""The Spirit,"" based on the work by one of his heroes, Will Eisner.

On screen ... it's something else. Largely a poor extension of the flashy green-screen techniques used in Miller/Rodriguez's ""Sin City,"" but primarily just a huge disappointment. Big misstep for Miller, who's responsible for some historic comic book moments; this flop may well muddy the waters for ""Sin City 2"" and it's simply not a proper adaptation of Eisner.

Too goofy to take seriously, too sanctimonious and solemn to be much fun, ""The Spirit"" is to Eisner's source material what the original ""Casino Royale"" was to the Bond saga. It also openly steals, or unwisely apes, elements from films as disparate as ""Kill Bill Vol. 2,"" ""Demolition Man"" and even ""Sin City"" (the Spirit didn't wear Chucks, but SC's Dwight did).

Visually: Nearly every frame is striking. It's clearly a film directed by an artist. Samuel L. Jackson throws himself into the mix with palpable relish. The ladies look very nice and I actually didn't have as much of a problem with Gabriel Macht as lots of other critics did.

But it's hard to care much about the movie, hobbled above everything else by some of the worst pacing I've ever seen in a genuine studio motion picture -- Scene after scene serve their purpose and then continue to drag on and on and on and on and on, repeatedly reiterating or expanding on what we already knew before we were told. Too long almost by half, this is an action movie that doesn't have a clue when to just shut up and move on.

Seeing a bad movie by a bad director is one thing, but seeing a bad movie by a creative force like Miller is even more dispiriting (that's honestly not a pun, just the only word that fits).

To make matters worse, ""The Spirit"" DVD also contains one of the worst, most self-congratulatory commentaries I've ever heard, an unapologetic gush-fest from Miller and one of the film's producers.

The only noteworthy feature on the disk is ""Miller on Miller,"" a fascinating but scattered interview with the man himself on the history of comics.",1240272000,6,2119,4.695417789757412
2389269,5,B000AKB1GW,"How on earth could I give this travesty 5 stars?  Well, I don't know Frank Miller from Mitch Miller or Will Eisner from Michael Eisner.  So I have no idea if The Spirit is faithful to the spirit of The Spirit.

That said, I loved the visual style and (thank god) the humor of this movie.  One can argue whether we need more grim, end of the world movies (apparently so) but when a guy hits another guy over the head with a toilet seat, this tells me they are going for a laugh and with the over the top visuals and situations in the movie, why not?

The dialog did remind me of Adam West's Batman but except for Scarlett Johansson (who, yes, nearly ruined the whole thing) it was fun.",1240185600,2,684,4.151515151515151
2389270,4,B000AKB1GW,"I cant believe people don't get this movie. For starters, Frank Miller wrote the film adaption of a comic series written by Will Eisner in the 40's. I found the movie to be a great throwback to the good ol classic movies, however with a bunch of modernness. It was an all around fun movie, escapism at it's finest. While watching you cannot take it too seriously. The language will throw some off at first, but you just have to think about how everyone spoke in the 30's and 40's.",1240099200,3,480,4.344444444444444
2389271,3,B000AKB1GW,"For more this film was relatively forgettable.  I 'watched' it while playing video games on another screen in my entertainment room and for the most part found myself far more interested in the video game than I was in what was going on in the film.  What parts that did catch my attention convinced me that the over-acting or awful acting that some others complain of in their comments about this film is what I'd have to say was completely misunderstood.  The over-acting is intentional and is there to make the film all the more campy and comic-bookish.

That style is one that some people just don't seem to appreciate or 'get.'  Some people enjoy campiness, while others find it boring, if not outright offensive and unwatchable.

I have to say that given the style that seems to be desired here Samuel L. Jackson is perfect for his role, but then I think Samuel L. Jackson is just about perfect for every role I've ever seen him in (he seems to do a pretty good job of taking roles that he fits well in and of course he gets offered roles that he'd likely do good work in).  The other actors here seem to do well too, though Jackson so clearly nails his role that it's harder to recognize how good or bad others around him really are.

In technical respect the Blu-ray is fine.  The picture quality is very good, and the audio is just fine, but again, unfortunately this is all wrapped around a story that most people would say is ok at best.

Unless you are a big fan of Frank Miller, rent this one first as you may not wish to use your disposable income on a purchase.",1240099200,2,1576,4.366438356164384
2389272,4,B000AKB1GW,"This week's best bet for rental is SPLINTER. But rather than focus on just horror films here I thought I'd let you know about another good one to hit shelves this week, THE SPIRIT. If you missed it at the theater you weren't alone as most audiences didn't quite know what to make of it.

Based on the classic comic book series of the golden age of comics drawn by Will Eisner, the Spirit became a popular icon and comic again during the late 60's and early 70's. Eisner became the hero of comic book industry insiders so much that awards for comics are named after him, The Eisners. But it was fan and comic icon himself Frank Miller that decided to bring the character to the screen.

Like Miller's own comic series SIN CITY, THE SPIRIT takes place in a not to distant path world of gangsters and molls, good guys and bad and a city that never sleeps. The city is as much a character in these stories as are its heroes and villains.

The Spirit (Gabriel Macht) is awakened by a phone call from an old friend, a cop who thinks the nefarious Octopus (Samuel Jackson) is involved in something bad going down. Tossing on his clothes, which must include his fedora and red tie, The Spirit hits the rooftops trying to get to the site.

Unfortunately things were going down and the cop in question was shot. The Octopus IS involved and a toss down between him and The Spirit ensues that involves them smashing one another with everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink. Yes, this is not your realistic comic book adaptation but a comic brought to life true to the original form. And many of the antics involving The Spirit played themselves out like Tex Avery cartoons with hyped up weaponry and fisticuffs.

The Octopus escapes with the help of his henchmen (hilarious cloned creatures) and his right had gal, Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson). A clue left by the wounded cop leads The Spirit to a second culprit involved here, one Sand Saref (Eva Mendes), the girl who broke his heart when they were both just teens.

The story unfolds with two boxes, both containing ancient artifacts that Sand and The Octopus each want. The problem is both have the boxes that the other wants. And of course criminals can't be trusted for an even trade. Just what is in the boxes and why they are so important is revealed as the story breaks out.

As the two jostle for control of the boxes, The Spirit tries to find them and bring them both to justice. Along the way he gets lectured by the Police Commissioner Dolan (Dan Lauria) and shot or wounded several times which gives him a chance to see his gal, Ellen Dolan (Sarah Paulson), a doctor and the daughter of the Commissioner. Hopelessly in love with The Spirit, she hurts with each flirtatious glance he gives another woman. Which is about every one he sees.

The final showdown between bad guys and good eventually plays out. But not before this stylistic examination of the comic book art form is brought to life on screen. Shot mostly in black and white much like SIN CITY was, the film offers a splash of color here and there.

Miller (who wrote and directed) could have gone for the straight forward hero/action flick that many would have. But never one to take the easy route, he opted instead for the irreverence and full blooded slapstick that was commonly found in the comic books. And it actually works when you go in knowing this.

The specials on this disc are interesting in their own right. One involves Miller talking about the making of the movie. A fascinating short gives Miller time to talk about Miller and his own contributions to the comic art form, complete with illustrations of his works.

The disc in blu-ray is exquisite, giving a crispness and clearness that is needed to make the black and white images seem to pop right off the screen. If a story is based in that film noir genre, why not make it appear that way as well.

The leads and supporting actors all do a fantastic job but leave the viewer with one sad note. As poorly as this did at the box office, the chances of seeing them together again seem slim. So if you like a good hard boiled detective story, a comic book hero or just a bit of fun, then make sure you watch THE SPIRIT. It deserved better and maybe it will get just that on DVD.",1240099200,13,4262,4.478092783505154
2389273,3,B000AKB1GW,"Chalk me up as a Frank Miller fanboy.  Along with fellow visionary Alan Moore, he changed the world of comic books forever with his bleak, noir-heavy storytelling and striking art style into something that wasn't just for kids anymore.  God bless him for that.  Along with Robert Rodriguez, he brought his pulp masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B000BCKFWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>&nbsp;to the big screen and kicked the a$z of every person who saw it.  But could he duplicate the same artistic success with somebody else's creation and without the help of a directing dynamo like Rodriguez?  Not so much.  But in spite of all the bile that has been spewed upon Miller's solo directorial debut ""The Spirit"", I had myself a good ol' time.  And with the right attitude, you might as well.  Just be prepared for a whole lotta cheese.

Now I have not read any of Will Eisner's comics so I simply cannot comment on how this fares as an adaptation.  I suspect not so well.  A lot of people who saw this went in seeing the amazing visual style of ""Sin City"" coupled with Miller's name and expected more of the same.  Visually, ""The Spirit"" may be even better, but the tone.....well I can honestly say I haven't seen anything else quite like it. Between this and some of his recent comic work (oh yeah, ""All-Star Batman and Robin"", I'm looking at you!) I believe that Miller has gone little bit bonkers after so many years of writing mean and nasty comic books.  This movie is practically a comedy.  At times absurdly so.  I'm talking Adam West as Batman comedic.  For all the stark black-and-white imagery, classic crime story dialogue, and sultry vamps it's hard to take a film or character seriously when he's thrown out of a building by his girl, gets his coat caught on a statue and dangles with his pants around his ankles while a crowd mocks him (one kid simply states ""He looks stupid!"", while another bystander chimes ""You will believe a man CAN'T fly!"").  In the end, ""The Spirit"" is about camp as much as anything else.  I laughed out loud several times.  This movie is definitely being filed in the ""so bad it's good"" file.  I just think that Miller's faux-serious tone here coupled with the darkness of his previous work just did not gel with the fans on this one.

Lots of good, though.  Again, the visuals are stunning.  This is one aspect that has always been a can't miss for Frank Miller. The silhouette image of white blood on black concrete, the partially-real/partially-animated hero jumping from rooftop to rooftop, the classical sexiness of the ladies, the reds, the greys; this one is head-to-toe eye candy.  Speaking of which, I was shocked to find a PG-13 flick from a man who is loathe to ever draw a fully-clothed woman.  Maybe Miller's a chauvinist or just a slave to his adolescent fantasies (the smart money's on door #2) but aside from a few genuine a$zkicking characters like Elektra and deadly little Miho, it seems like every woman he draws is A) as close to naked as he can get her if he's drawing a mainstream comic,  B) naked if at all possible, C) in the story primarily for titillation, and D) ridiculously horny.  The gallery here is sexy as all hell, but amount to a bunch of caricatures.  But to be fair, every character in this film is a caricature, not just the ""broads"".  This brings me to the best casting choice this side of Paz Vega as the blade-wielding looney-tune Plaster of Paris (yes, that is her name): Samuel L. Jackson as the cosplay-happy supervillain The Octopus.  When it comes to playing comically over-the-top, this is the man to call first.  In one scene he and his henchmistress are dressed as samurai.  If I was in the theater, I would have shouted ""SHO NUFF!"" at the screen.  Then maybe one dude would have laughed because he actually saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Dragon/dp/B00005JD5H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Dragon</a>.  God, I'm a freakin' nerd.

The story....who cares.  Some complete nonsense about Greek mythology, immortality, and The Spirit's long-lost girlfriend.  The point is this: this movie is 100% bat$hi+, ridiculous, visually stimulating, and good for some WTF-style laughs.  I'm talking tiny head attached to a foot hopping around WTF-style laughs.  I mean a villain who works eggs into every conversation he has over the course of an hour and a half WTF-style laughs.  If you take a second of this film seriously , you'll have wasted your time.  This is just a guilty pleasure homage filled with sly references to comics and cinema past.  Arguably better then the film is the special feature ""Miller on Miller"" where the master gives us a 15-minute lesson on comic history and the medium's significance along with a metric ton of insight into his life and career.

Truth be told, I don't know what the hell Frank Miller was thinking when he unleashed ""The Spirit"" on an unsuspecting world.  This film is just bizarre and nonsensical to the hilt.  There's a lot of fun to be had with it, but I am hardly surprised by the chilly reception it received.  Only a certain kind of genre fanatic will get anything out of it, but if you're up for some cinematic weirdness that pays tribute to the days of pulp long past, then give this DVD a spin.",1240012800,43,5362,4.888150609080841
2389274,2,B000AKB1GW,"From the hack who ripped off the story of Thermopillae with his adaptation of 300, comes Frank Millers next Sin City knock-off, The Spirit.  And while the Spirit pay homage to the classic and corny comic dialogue of the past.  The film itself doesn't do anything that great or memorable that wasn't done in Sin City.  The movie was shot against the blue screen like 300 and Sin City, but the effect has become common place by now, and same with the over-the-top acting of Sam Jackson, and his one gear acting prowess playing the Octopus, which might as have been any character he's ever played.  The movie falls flat with it's central character being something of a mystery having died previously, but the story delivery is such that the viewer will not care about any character's back story.  The dialogue is poor at worst and camp at best, and camp isn't something to reach for or be proud of, not having any likeable or interesting characters delivering these camp lines makes the movie meaningless.  Action sequences are dull and boring.  There is nothing to keep the viewer that interested in any of the characters, well except the split second of seeing Eva Mendes' behind, but that's just me and my love of Eva Mendes and her ample behind.  Ohh and Scarlett Johansson is in the film, but she's just a horrible actress, so having her in the film only makes it worse.  The lead Gabriel Macht, I'm not too sure if he's just a bad actor delivering a bad performance or a very good actor delivering a very great performance into a bad script, anyway it's not pretty, however, he does fit the part of a classic super hero with the square jaw and good looks, he's in the vain of the chiseled hero.  This is a boring movie that is done kinda like Sin City, but lacks that level of polish and assemble cast, pass on this movie, borrow it if a friend was dumb enough to buy it, it's not even worth the rental.",1240012800,,1906,4.46685878962536

Jackson and uber-cool Gabriel Macht duked it out (with toilets...c'mon, it was funny!) and as some of Hollywood's most gorgeous leading ladies gave campy, noir-esque performances. the film itself felt more like a tribute, a parody...or maybe just a break from all of the dark and gritty comic films that have been the forerunners in summer cinema. i LOVED Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, for example, for its thought provoking parables and its epic tale of human corruption. but really, Miller's The Spirit served its purpose as a lighthearted good time, and if people would stop taking it so seriously and stop expecting it to follow the same thread as Sin City, they might actually enjoy it.",1239840000,7,1349,4.9734513274336285

2389285,3,B000AKB1GW,"Okay, I gave this one an extra star just for the visual splendor of it, but on its own storytelling merrits it only warrants two, maybe one depending on the mindset of the viewer.

Look as hard as you may, but a plot synopsis you will not find.

Firstly, I'm a huge Eisner fan and I love The Spirit comics.  I am also an admirer of Frank Miller.  Miller was one of the first comic book celebrities I was aware of at the tender age of ten.  One of the reasons I was so stoked about seeing Robocop 2, even though I hadn't been interested in seeing the original(though, now I think its one of the best Sci-fi/action/future satires ever made and now about to be remade--ughhh).  The new film version of The Spirit really does capture the tone and, um, spirit of the original Eisner works.  The action scenes are goofy, cartoony and always defy logic.  The heroes are bright and spritely, and the villains are outrageous, likeable and not as horrible as their nefarious plans may indicate.  The film adaption doesn't stray from those tropes.  It does go one step beyond Eisner by giving villain The Octopuss a face(the comics only revealed a striped gloved hand).  Samule L. Jackson plays The Octopuss in this film and he barely looks like he's working.  You can tell he had a blast just cutting loose on this character.  You really enjoy his screen time and you like him more then The Spirit himself.  He never poses any real threat.  This takes some of the drama out of the whole film.  No one legitimately feels in danger.  It doesn't help that both our hero and villain aren't easily killed, they have Wolverine like healing powers.  So, in essence, watching them duel is weightless.  Though, the script tends to provide The Spirit with moments of physical weakness, not well-defined, when the story calls for it.

Gabriel Macht plays the title hero and does an okay job.  He's not given much to work with.  The Spirit is a simple cypher with an even simpler backstory, which is shown in small detail towards the end of the film.  Macht has the right style of acting for the part, very 40's noir, gee-golly do-gooder type mannerisms and dialogue.  He's good for the tone but the character as a whole isn't that memorable.

Eva Mendes steals the movie from the rest of the cast though.  Not only has she never been filmed so beautifully and sexy, she really gets the sophisticated ex-street kid vibe the film gives her.  A whole movie about her character living in this world would've been more entertaining.  Scarlet Johansen isn't awful in the film, but she is wasted.  She has a few shining moments of funny character beats but her involvement in the film is minimal and ultimately unwarranted.  There are many other female characters that show up throughout the film, but Sarah Paulson gets the honor of playing The Spirit's 'his girl Friday' role.  She does it well as a sqaure, independent woman-surgeon but it doesn't come close the banter shared by Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron-Man.

Special note must also go to Dan Lauria(the dad from The Wonder Years) as the Commissioner.  He has the old hard as nails, pent up and angry, but all heart on the inside character common in old noir down pat.

The film looks like Sin City in style and technique, but it goes further with the visuals.  Basically, The Spirit takes the premise of the visuals of Sin City and takes them closer to being direct pages from a Miller, or Eisner comic.  This is what the film is, all Eisner fetish's and Miller fetish's thrown into a blender.  The plot is inconsequential.  There's nothing interesting or original about it.  It seems to be secondary to the visuals, broad characterizations and silly gags.  Yes, this film is loaded with silly visual gags and puns.  The tone is light, just a notch away from becoming parody.  This is going to upset all the modern comic movie fans who just got their taste buds wet with Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, and Watchmen.  There are scenes, about three, where The Spirit refers to the audience and breaks the fourth wall.  This is a fun concept, Miller uses it sparingly and very specifically.

My problems with the film come from the fact that I didn't care what happened to anyone, and I didn't care about the relationships they had with each other.  There's no weight what-so-ever.  Even Batman and Robin got dramatic weight from the dying butler!  Since both hero and villain are almost immortal their fights are just boring exercises in style, kind of cool at first but ultimately tiresome.  Plus, The Spirit's 'abilities are ill-defined.  He can take all sort of brutal beatings and do daring acrobatics one second and then he's bleeding to death due to a sword in the gut.  He only seems to be effected by inflicted violence when the plot narrative requires him to be.  Though, we do get a neat concept in the form of Lorelei(Jamie King) the beautiful angel of death that haunts the spirit in his sleep, calling him to cross over and to stop cheating death.  There's a great visual scene that has The Spirit fighting her off and keeping to his self-appointed duty of saving and continuing to love he city, Central City.

The bottom line is this, the film has no dramatic weight, and the special effects grandeur of the visuals will become tiresome for most.  With films like The Dark Knight giving us characters to invest in this is a real problem when making a fantasy film like this.  A lot of style over substance, too much.

SIDENOTE: A lot of the negative reviews of this film seem to go after the dialogue in with great attention.  Sorry, but the dialogue is one of the film's virtues.  It's ultra stylised noir speak that was commonplace of the noir films of the black and white days.  It's used casually here and its taken seriously.  Modern audiences may not pick up on this and find it to be poorly written, but I find it fits into Frank Miller's universe created for this film.  Miller is fans of films most modern audiences have never seen, let alone even heard of.

PS: Some of the film's action sequences have a choppy qaulity in the editing. Specifically, when it comes to graphic violence, like bullet hits, cutting flesh, and severed body parts.  Miller loves over-the-top violence that is gross but not to be taken seriously, and I think in order to achieve the lauded PG-13 rating all fantasies films seem to have to obtain, he had to cut around sequences of violence, and unfortunately it's jarring and not pleasing to the eye.  I smell an unrated editon on the horizon, well if this edition sells or rents well.",1239753600,5,6577,4.609819121447028
2389286,1,B000AKB1GW,"This is a film that should never have been made. The source material is bad, the script is terrible and the direction is amaturish. There just isn't anything good about it. What it reminds me of is Warren Beatty's 1990 Dick Tracy movie.

The first flaw is the source material. However good Eisner and his ghosts may have been as illustrators in their time, the spirit is a lame and very dated character. It wants to be a Noir Private Eye story, it wants to be Dick Tracy, it wants to be Batman, it wants to be the shadow but in the end its just a mess dervative of everything but standing for nothing. The character is also not one that ever held a special iconic place in American culture (outside of the closed circles of hardcore comic book fans). And of course there is the racism. Eisner was unapolgetic to the end over the character of ""Ebony White"". He defended his use of the worse sort of racial stereotypes in later life by comparing his work to that of Charles Dickens. Miller solves the problem by erasing the character and pretending it didn't exist.

And then there is Frank Miller as writer/director. The script is unbelievably bad. The dialogue is simply embarrasing. The problem for Miller is that he is trying to do homiage in a style that is alien to his own. Rather than create his own Spirit in his own style, he wants to ghost Will Eisner (and Eisner's own stable of ghosts). It just doesn't work at any level. What you get here is what you would get if Miller had tried to produce a ""batman"" story that was true to the crude 1940s stories of Bob Kane or if he had tried to produce a ""Daredevil"" story based on a 1960s story by Stan Lee. Whatever Miller's faults, he has a personal style. And when he walks away from that style (as in the Spirit), it just doesn't work.

Miller the Director is amaturish in the extreme. He is too committed to trying to swipe Eisner panels visually. He doesn't have the skills to transform his storyboard way of thinking into a film. What the film shows more than anything is the help some of his other film projects have received from good directors. Again, one of the major problems is that he is attempting hoimage to a style radically different from his own and he doesn't have the skills to pull it off. The film is also manic-depressive. It bounces between moods with no particular pattern and ends up doing nothing but being very annoying. Miller simply doesn't know, as a director, how to properly do dramatic transitions.

Overall, there are way too many characters. The film is overloaded with repetitive femme fatales. Eisner using six or seven different ones over years in a strip makes sense. But using six or seven of them in a two-hour film doesn't work. They all blur into each other.

Miller's biggest alteration to the original work is the character of the Octopus. He throws out Eisner's version entirely and replaces it with the standard superhero film villian circia ten years ago. Lots of over the top banter and big guns. Miller often seems to be pushing The Spirit in the direction of being more superhero than the source material.

In summary, the Spirit should never have been made. The character just doesn't work in a film. And if it had to be made, someone other than Frank Miller should have been found to write/direct it. He is too much of a fan doing Homiage as the writer. He doesn't have the dramatic skills necessary to be a director.",1239753600,7,3424,4.505636070853462
2389287,2,B000AKB1GW,"Man, I was not quite sure how I was going to react to this film. Not that I'm on Will Eisner's jock or anything or that I'm that big of a Spirit buff, but as a kid I did read some of the Spirit's collected comic strips and was struck with how innovative those pages looked (especially the title pages). So, yes, going into the film, I had a preconceived notion of what the Spirit should look and feel like. As it turns out, visually, THE SPIRIT is arresting eye candy, even if it smacks too much of SIN CITY. And I guess I'm even okay with how the Spirit looks, with his having traded the rumpled blue business suit for a more somber black one. I even dig the day-glo soles, and that red tie remains vivid. But, oh dear, the storytelling...

In Central City, rookie cop Denny Colt bites a bullet but then rises from the dead to become a masked urban vigilante. Having relinquished his former identity, the Spirit works side by side with Central City's police force to foil a rogues' gallery bizarre enough to give Batman and Dick Tracy's odd nogoodniks a run for their money. So far, so good. But then, Samuel L. Jackson enters the picture, and even though the man probably does a fine job as the Spirit's archenemy, the Octopus, the overriding thought that struck me whenever he's on screen is: ""Cripes, it's Samuel Jackson doing his Samuel Jackson thing!"" So there's a chance that Samuel Jackson may be flirting with overexposure. He's already Nick Fury, Shaft, Afro Samurai, Jules Winnfield and Mace Windu. Even Pop Culture is saying, ease up now, brah.

Echoing Eisner's stories, the Spirit runs into a bevy of gorgeous but dangerous beauties, from the highly intelligent Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson), to the exotic and loony Plaster of Paris (Paz Vega), to Lorelei, the Angel of Death (Jaime King). In the Thankless Roles Department, Sarah Paulson plays Ellen Dolan, the Spirit's faithful goody-goody sweetheart and not at all a femme fatale. Eva Mendes sizzles as Sand Saref, Denny Colt's avaricious childhood sweetheart and most certainly a femme fatale. Sand Saref's psyche is twisted enough that one insight claims that she suffers from an Electra complex (which is the opposite of an Oedipus complex). And as an appreciative guy-slash-pig, I can't help but celebrate Frank Miller's celebration of Eva Mendes's, er, more prominent talents.

Who nowadays doesn't have a healing factor? The Spirit of the comic strips may have been resurrected but he still always seemed like an everyman schmoe and that was always part of the draw. Introducing this regenerative element, basically making him into just another superhero, seems like a slap in the mug. But what torpedoes this film more than anything else is that Frank Miller - brilliant as a comic book writer/artist but dim as a director - seems to think that comic books and movies are one and the same. On the positive side, the film unveils striking imagery and awesome punch-in-the-face action. On the dubious, there are those dreary, overwrought inner monologues and what I like to call those I-am-embarassed-for-Frank-Miller soliloquies. There are scenes that simply do not work, no matter how much Miller tries to make them appealing or interesting. That whole sequence with a captured Spirit and the Octopus gigged out in Adolf's glad rags is an exercise in incomprehensibility and long-windedness. Yes, the audience does finally get the 411 on the crucial origin story and the thrust of the plot (it hinges on the Octopus's pursuit of immortality), but, honestly, I'd rather have had piranhas make a beeline for my goodies. And the fervent way the Spirit talks about the City, he and the City should just go get a room. Also high on the annoymemeter are those awkward intrusions by the Angel of Death (who, I gather, is also trying hard to get a room with the Spirit).

Huh. I just noticed that I haven't even mentioned the actor who plays the Spirit.

My last two cents is that THE SPIRIT, while looking very good, comes off as hollow and heavy-handed and plodding enough that at times I had trouble keeping my eyes open. There's no real depth to the characters, and even the awesome Samuel Jackson overdoes the cool schtick. On the bright side, I perked up when I heard Christina Aguilera's rendition of ""Falling In Love Again"" during the end credits. But I go back to an early scene, during a Spirit/Octopus fighty fight. Even that early into the movie, I had a sinking feeling. And when the Spirit gets kabonked on the noggin by the porcelain toilet, I went: ""Yep, that's about right.""",1239667200,8,4562,4.784263959390863

2389291,5,B000AKB1GW,"If you 'get' Frank Miller, and like the way he tells a story, you will love this misunderstood/underrated and brilliant movie.

Everyone thinks they 'get' Frank Miller... 'neo-noir', 'gritty', 'crime drama', I suppose there is a point there, but no one seems to understand that his stories are told with a sense of joy, and a flair that is unique.  I enjoyed Sin City (the movie) greatly, but... I was missing that joy.  Robert Rodriguez's influence is just too strong and it makes the movie much bleaker than the comics.  I didn't like 300 (the movie) at all, though the massive over-usage of slow motion and sub-bass had a lot to do with that, but it too was missing the joy... they made the movie about being brave instead of about the joy of battle even against insurmountable odds, and a glorious death (which was a Spartan thing and Frank got it, but Snyder didn't).  Here with The Spirit, Frank made a movie only Frank could make, and I loved it.  Loaded with that unique sense of joy that only, only Frank Miller can create.

All of the so-called 'movie reviewers' and so-called 'comic fans' that didn't like this movie, just simply didn't 'get' it, or don't like Frank, or don't like The Spirit.  Most of these people have never read Frank's comics, or any The Spirit comics, any yet feel 'informed' enough to just assume that because it wasn't what they expected, it must suck.  Wrong.  I've seen comments about how small most of the femme fatales roles were... there are like seven of them since Frank was trying to get them all some face time.  What do these people want?  20 minute monologues for each girl?  Or for Frank to narrow it down to 2?  Why?  Why does a character have to have a huge role just because they are played by a known actress?  If they had boring names and boring outfits, and weren't known actresses would anyone have complained?  How about the 'inconsistent tone/all over the place' comments?  Yes, because every movie must always be serious, or always be silly, or always be melodramatic, or always be zany for it's entirety.  I'm sorry but that concept is just too daft for words.  News Flash: life has inconsistent tones, and since the movie follows several characters coming to the same end point, it, you know, makes sense.  Grow up, and step out of the group-think, comics fans and movie reviewers.

Bottom Line: this movie is an absolute ton of FUN.  Pure, joyful, unadulterated Frank Miller fun.  Enjoy.",1239408000,6,2447,4.637209302325582
2389292,4,B000AKB1GW,"I notice people get caught up in the content reviews for this film, but I think one has to look at the entire product to appreciate this piece. Personally, I felt the film was a train wreck at high speed, but technically, I loved it. Skipping the story, which I have watched several times in the store and at home, I instead thoroughly enjoyed the technical aspects.

Sound: The 7.1 DTS got plenty of testing with the POV always getting shifted numerous times through each shoot-out. Quite a few customers who were irritated by the film have asked what scene could be forwarded to in demonstrating an adequate test showing (everyone likes to show off their home theater eventually). That would have to be chapter 14, or 1:24:00 into the film. It provided the best overall performance for screen and channels.

Picture: Not much to pick apart as the green screen visuals appeared flawless, and really the only fault I saw in doing screen captures (both LCD and Plasma) was Eva's nude scene, where it looked as if someone took a magic marker to cover the breast shots (pixelation and mismatched colors). Otherwise, the reflections, eyes and water footage were all managed nicely. Would almost want to compare Tarsem's black and white water emergence footage with Eva's here. Admittedly though, several people with low refresh rate panels get the drag/blur with all of the contrasts and motion.

The supplements are thorough and offer the Eisner and Miller fans plenty to watch and re-watch. The MoLog option has given a few of my customers with too much time on their hands interesting opportunities in adding their own graphics to certain scenes. The menu manipulation has some weaknesses, especially for someone like me who wants to access the beginning of the movie again without waiting for the cycling to finish, it only allows you to surf through ALL chapter stops to get back to 1, instead of looping.

Overall, the visuals catch the eye of anyone walking by, and the feedback has been very split, but for the artistic fans out there this is a definite owner, and for most other parties it will be a renter.",1239321600,6,2112,4.778082191780822

It's the cinematic equivalent of Frank Miller's recent comic work: incredible visuals with ridiculous, over-the-top dialogue.
Likewise, if you try to take this film seriously then you may not gain much gratification.
However if you view The Spirit with an open mind as you would while watching the Adam West Batman show or reading Frank Miller and Jim Lee's All-Star Batman and Robin, then you're sure to have a much more enjoyable time with this irreverent pop culture parody.
At several points in this film you just have to laugh out loud at the absurdity.
Just don't go in expecting Sin City or The Dark Knight.
The Spirit is on the other end of the artistic spectrum, demented post-modern camp/kitsch exploitation.

Even though Miller updated The Spirit with his own visual trademarks and sense of humor, in many ways it's very faithful to Will Eisner's comic.
I must emphasize the term ""comic"" since that is exactly what Will Eisner's creation was, a comic book with a humorous, comedic core.
In any sense of the word, The Spirit is a ""comic"" film through and through.
You get the feeling as if Frank Miller wrote/illustrated a modern Spirit graphic novel and then adapted his work to film panel by panel.
Comic fans will also appreciate many of the subtle (and not so subtle) nods to comic book culture such as ""the Elektra complex"", which of course references Miller's own legendary run on Daredevil. (which was inspired by Will Eisner's original Sand Saref storyline from The Spirit)

In conclusion, The Spirit is a fun comic book film ideal for Frank Miller fans and comic book fans in general with an offbeat sense of humor.",1238630400,31,1705,4.776271186440678

Some of the members of the cast were so bad at acting I can only assume they are either friends or family of Frank Miller's, an example being the female cop who in my opinion surved no purpose in the film at all.

This is the first movie I ever walked out of, My family and I all got up and left 20 minutes before the end of the film.

2389308,5,B000AKB1GW,"I'll keep this simple.  The few reviews that I have seen all centered on a general theme of ""bad dialog"".....welll..........if you read the old original comics....and the new ones........this is right straight out of them....

The few reviews that I saw panned the ""dialog"".  And I think that they did this because they have to ""put in their chops"" with their ""in crowd"" that regularly reads their reviews.......

I mean they can't  very well pan a shoo in blockbuster like Dark Knight so they have to pan..SOMETHING....and I'm sure that the ""smarter than thous"" figured that this was as good a candidate as any for a ""throwaway"" review....

A lot of the ""dialog"" that they ""panned"" is the Spirit.....""talking"" to the City..... and......if you think about it, this is the first experience for a lot of folks with the character and him 'talking to the City' is how the producers fill in part of his ""back story""...Now in the comics....this same dialog...was spread over many issues..... In the film the producers have to kind of give it to the viewer in a couple of set pieces.....

I would say that of the few reviews that I have read... that the reviewer had NOT read the comics...if they had then they would have known what is going on....

But anyway, the ""talking to the City"" parts are filling the viewer in on how he feels about ""the City"" rather like how the Batman is conflicted about his relationship with bad guys and his back story...of course the ""smarter than thou"" reviewers couldn't very well pan THAT dialog...so...they had to pan SOMETHING this year....

Here's a taste of what you'll like about The Spirit..

If you like(ed) the comics........if you like a different visual style...the visuals are right straight out of the comics....lots of stark black and white and reds.... then you'll like the film..

If you are aware of comics in general there are several ""in jokes"" the most obvious of which is the reference to Steve Ditko(a famous comic artist with an absolutely unique style)...one of the ladies involved is named Sand Serif..... if you know anything about how the little ""tails"" are put on letters like the letters in this sentence there is an obvious reference to the comic people who write the dialogue in ""san Serif"".... and a lot of other references....

The ........cat.......is there.......and just as delicious as Samuel L. Jackson... you can tell that Arthur loved this role.... :)

And speaking of Samuel L. Jackson..... he.... is.....  absolutely EXQUISITE ......as the ""bad guy"".....really.... he really shined in this.....and you could tell that he and Macht really enjoyed their playing off each other....

Frank Miller, the producer, who also did Sin City, was in a cameo in this.... if you saw Sin City and liked it, imagine Sin City only with a lighter tone... not Sin City ""lite""....just a lighter tone....

My better half......who does not like ""this kind"" of film....she likes ""realism"" not....""sylistic"".....liked it.....so....just goes to show that maybe the ""mainstream"" likes stuff that the smarter than thous don't.... :)

Here's a thing for you while you're watching the film....... see if you can count how many people talk with an ever so slight ""lisp"" from their overbite! :) lol

and how many names do the petri dishes have?! :)

2389309,4,B000AKB1GW,"Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht), a seemingly dead cop, returns from ""beyond the grave"" in order to clean up crime in the city that he loves.

Although visually similar in style to ""Sin City"" and written and directed by Frank Miller, the creator of ""Sin City"", that's where the similarities between these two movies ends. ""The Spirit"" is a silly, anachronistic, over-the-top piece of fluff with none of the sadism that characterizes Miller's other works. You could easily show this film to a 10 year old without having to worry about them being emotionally scarred for life. In fact, this reminds me of a lot of the adventure films that I used to watch, and love, when I was growing up in the `80's. Not much swearing or violence, but plenty of action.

Many of the newspaper reviews that I have read of this movie criticize it for being ""stupid"", and I agree with that whole-heartedly, but that is the reason why I liked this film. Because of its stupidity, ""The Spirit"" is a lot of fun. Sure, it's cheesy and Samuel L. Jackson is practically chewing on the scenery, especially in one particular scene when he gets to give one of the big speeches that seems to be his trademark, but in the cinema that I saw this in, the audience was laughing from beginning to end (which is a lot better than I can say about some comedies that I've seen), and the actors who appeared in this film seemed to be having a lot of fun, too.

If you're expecting another ""Sin City"" or ""300"", then you'll probably hate this film, but if you want a film to see a light hearted, superhero action film with an abundance of stupidly quotable lines, and some pretty amazing visuals, then this is the film to see.",1233446400,,1679,4.480392156862745
2389310,2,B000AKB1GW,"I am a fan of Frank Miller. I have enjoyed his other movies, Sin City and 300. I absolutely enjoyed those two movies because they delivered and were both very enjoyable.

The Spirt. Not so much. As a fan of Frank Miller I enjoyed the visual effects and the story line. I enjoyed the vivid colors and the story line. But for him delivering two action packed, drama infused movies previously - The Spirit did not fire on all pistons.  It was in a simple word - disapointing.",1231372800,,472,4.3522727272727275
2389311,3,B000AKB1GW,"I'm really conflicted reviewing The Spirit because it was both a masterpiece cinematically and a terrible money in every other respect.

So let's talk about the visuals, they were mesmerizing and I think even more effective then Sin City. The soft snow always playing about the camera's focus gave a uniquely sense of depth within such a low key movie. The lighting was also splendid throughout, I really feel like they did a beautiful job overcoming what the senior VFX supervisor/second unit director Stu Maschwitz reefers to as greenscreen psychosis where all of the people on set get get the impression that everything they do doesn't matter because it's all going to be done in post. This isn't the case the result is particularly good footage in it's fantastic style. I loved the slow-motion pieces too, especially the early scene where the shot dry for underwater, it didn't look like it was underwater, but it looked like a very stylized trip below the surface. (mild spoilers)

Then there's the story. The narrative felt very hollow and inconsequential, I never felt like any of the characters really alive or could fit within the universe we're peering into. The underlining plot points we're painfully erected without giving us much of interest to go on, this was definitely the case with the Spirit and the Octopus' healing abilities. The blood of Hercules, what, really? What does that have to do with the Octopus' chemistry experiments? The other thing that seemed weird to me was that for a decent length movie I don't feel like that much actually happened, I never grew board but maybe the lack of complexity and a clear story arc might be what left me feeling so ambiguous as the story continued to progress. I can't recommend it enough because of the notes it gets right, but it's no contender for movie of the year.",1231113600,2,1834,4.819047619047619
2389312,1,B000AKB1GW,"What an insult to superhero movies; is it any wonder why people like Alan Moore dislike Frank Miller's work?  The man needs to choose a career: comics or movies, and stick to it.  Or at least keep his hands off the works of deceased comic veterans like Will Eisner.  No, I've not read the Spirit comics myself, but anyone could open up the comic and see that Eisner and Miller have two completely points of view. I do like Miller's film noir style, but the Spirit is certainly not fit for his style. He seemed so focused on his visual style, he forgot to actually write a fine screenplay, and let me emphasize that he did write the screenplay and direct. So this monstrosity was entirely his fault.  I also feel that some of the fine actors in this movie, like Samuel L. Jackson, wasted their talent on this.  I can almost envision Miller telling his cast to act like they're in a '40s picture as they rip out a cell phone on screen. On that note, he also needed to choose an era.  THEY DID NOT USE CELL PHONES IN THE 1940S.

Anyway, this movie is a waste of two hours and I don't recommend it. I was begging for the movie to end, and was so grateful when it did. I wish I would have seen Benajmin Button instead. What a waste of eight bucks.",1230940800,2,1242,4.215189873417722
2389313,4,B000AKB1GW,"Frank Miller's ""The Spirit"" is the epitome of a comic book movie, visually striking and perfectly cast, with a plot so over the top and dialogue so silly that it's actually a lot of fun. If you're even considering taking this movie seriously, it's best you skip it and then forget that you've ever heard of it. I listened to the corny lines and I saw the preposterous action sequences, but rather than be critical, I just shrugged it off and allowed myself to enjoy what I was watching. Based on the comic series created by Will Eisner, ""The Spirit"" is part superhero movie, part film noir, and part detective story with just a little sci-fi thrown in for good measure; they all come together to form a goofy but entertaining product, one so stylized that you can't help but stare at it in total fascination. Like Miller's ""Sin City"" and ""300,"" it creates a world of its own through amazing computer technology, turning every frame into a living interpretation of a comic book panel.

The setting: A dirty metropolis known as Central City, the kind of place where crime is as normal as self-indulgent voiceover narrations and slinky saxophone solos. Keeping watch from the shadows is the title character (Gabriel Macht), a mask-wearing, cat-loving vigilante who prefers black suits, black hats, and red ties. He started life as a rookie cop named Denny Colt, who was shot to death while on duty. Through a process I won't describe, and for reasons I won't reveal, he was brought back to life and now has the ability to heal very quickly, meaning his body can take a lot of abuse. Most of the abuse is at the hands of his archenemy, a mad scientist known only as The Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson), so named because he supposedly has eight of everything. In an early scene, the two meet at a local trash-polluted bog and beat each other senseless; at one point, The Octopus takes a discarded toilet and smashes it over The Spirit's head. ""Oh, come on,"" The Octopus sneers, ""toilets are always funny.""

The Octopus' sinister plan: Drink from an ancient vase containing the blood of Heracles (or maybe it's Hercules) and become immortal. Once that happens, he'll begin a campaign to take over the world. Unfortunately, a sultry femme fatale named Sand Saref (Eva Mendes) unknowingly took the crate containing the vase; she believed she had found a different crate, one that contained a very old, very special piece of armor. She and The Octopus must now negotiate a trade.

But The Spirit complicates matters. He and Sand were childhood friends until a family tragedy turned them against each other. As a teenager, she vowed she would leave Central City, become fabulously wealthy, and surround herself with a multitude of shiny things, like diamonds. She was as good as her word; she now has a reputation for marrying rich men, having them killed, and using their money to finance her underground crime empire.

Numerous side characters populate this film, all of which are given personality quirks unique enough for a comic book adaptation. There's the perpetually flustered Commissioner Dolan (Dan Lauria), who relies on The Spirit but doesn't approve of his methods. There's Dolan's daughter, Ellen (Sarah Paulson), a doctor who spends all her time at the hospital waiting for The Spirit; the two have had romantic flings, but his reputation as a womanizer strains their relationship. There's Morgenstern (Stana Katic), a rookie cop who dresses like a leather mistress and brings such youthful enthusiasm to the job. One of the most baffling characters is Lorelei Rox (Jaime King), a luminous phantom who always appears when The Spirit is on the verge of dying; how this came to be is anyone's guess, and so are her reasons for staying so close to The Spirit.

The Octopus also has a number of interesting side characters. His accomplice is Silken Floss (Scarlett Johansson), a scientist with eyelashes so long that they would have been the envy of Tammy Faye Baker. And then there are his cloned henchmen (all played by Louis Lombardi), big, brainless brutes who have Greek and Hispanic names that end with ""-os,"" such as Pathos, Huevos, Logos, Ethos, Rancheros, and Amigos. One of these clones is a freaky genetic accident--a tiny head attached to a bouncing foot.

While The Spirit is about as conventional a character as I expected, The Octopus continually surprised me. Consider the fact that he never wears the same outfit twice; he's the kind of person who wears anything that reflects his given mood. Within the course of this movie, we see him dressed as a scientist, a samurai, and a pseudo-pimp, with an expensive fur collar to boot. There's even a point when he dresses like a Nazi, and this is hilarious given the unbridgeable gap between his race and Hitler's ideology. He also has a tendency to work the topic of eggs into his conversations, which is strange since we never see him eating any. Basically, The Octopus is more comedy relief than he is a villain. I didn't mind a great deal, though; this character is so delightfully overblown that he's probably better suited for humor. He even adds credibility to one of The Spirit's sillier lines: ""I'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead."" Not too many audiences will appreciate lines like that, and I'm sure most won't appreciate the film as a whole. But if you're in the mood for escapist comic book fun, as I was, then you might want to consider seeing ""The Spirit.""",1230681600,,5430,4.789754535752401
2389314,3,B000AKB1GW,"Frank Miller brings Will Eisner's classic 1940's comic book hero ""The Spirit"" to the screen in the graphic style of ""Sin City"" and ""The 300."" The result is a visually stunning but uneven adventure story that may appeal most to fans of the modern possibilities of CGI.

The Spirit (Gabriel Macht) was once Denny Colt, a murdered Central City policeman, who has come mysteriously back to life, and back to work, as a masked crimefighter who cannot die.  The Spirit will spend part of the movie pondering his own origins, but most of it chasing a suitable arch-nemesis, the Octopus (played with snarling, over the top villiany by Samuel L. Jackson).  The Octopus, his sinister assistant Silken Floss (Scarlet Johannsen), and a troop of apparently cloned and rather dumb musclemen, are in search of a mysterious vase, the contents of which will make the Octopus immortal.

The Spirit works for the police commissioner of Central City, and is periodically patched up by his love-lorn daughter Ellen (Sarah Paulson).  However, his investigation of the Octopus takes him down his own paths.  One of them reveals the involvement of Sand Saref (Eva Mendes), master jewel thief but once the girlfriend of Denny Colt.  She will be both an enemy and an ally when the Spirit finally confronts the Octopus in the grand finale.

The visual style of the movie is arresting, even mythic.  Characters are broadly drawn: the females are all femme fatales, the cops all stoic, and the bad guys overwrought.  Unfortunately, the story line is often incoherent.  The action begins before the characters have been properly introduced, leaving the audience unsure of the stakes in an opening scene fight between the Spirit and the Octopus in an industrial cesspool.  The Spirit's origins are not explained until well into the movie, and his ADD relationship with every female in the movie never is. The audience is left to decide whether the movie means to be a comedy or a drama.

""The Spirit"" is worth a look for those movie goers who enjoyed the presentation style of ""Sin City"" and ""The 300.""  Those who didn't see either, and are unfamiliar with the comic book hero, may find the movie a challenge to follow.",1230422400,,2188,4.862533692722372

The two together? What could go wrong? This movie- possibly the single worst film ever made. I do not exaggerate. It was the most painful two hours of my life. I'd rather be tortured than to sit through this again. The ""acting"" is a whole new kind of bad. the word ""bad"" does not even begin to describe the hammy, barely-competent, cheese-ball performances the audience is subjected to. 'Bad"" does not warn one of the unbelievably confusing plot or ultra-cheesy dialog. It cannot describe how stupid and unwatchable the performances by Scarlett Johansen or Samuel Jackson (or anyone else for that matter)are.
