8027436,2,B0002F6AQQ,"Review in short:  I was looking for a surfing movie having loved Step into Liquid and Riding Giants.  This wasn't that type of movie at all.  Like others said, if you like Kelly Slater, you may find this interesting.  I was not impressed with the length or content based on the price I spent.  I would have rather borrowed this from a friend then buy it; now it's just going to collect dust.

Two stars because I like Kelly Slater.

Wanna borrow it?",1197590400,3,449,4.337349397590361
8027437,4,B0002F6AQQ,"If you like Kelly Slater you will like this video.

I happen to admire his surfing ability/style and enjoyed the video.  It is a bunch of clips of him when he is young (before he went bald).  It is kind of retro, but overall I enjoyed this video.

The whole soundtrack seems to be done by Mother Love Bone...and other early 90s Seattle bands.  Clips of Kelly surfing are combined with random commentary of Kelly eating a bowl of cereal, that is mildy amusing.

If you don't like Kelly Slater don't buy this.  If you do I would definitely get it, especially if the price is under $12.",1137369600,5,583,4.342592592592593
