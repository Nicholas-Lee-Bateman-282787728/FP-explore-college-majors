2542067,5,B000EWBNUU,"Elizabeth Montgomery is one of my absolutely favorite actresses. From light comedy to drama, she was truly the best. However, it takes a strong stomach to watch this amazing film that depicts (without spoilers) a sick relationship between mother and son.

Ms. Montgomery's performance is so perfect, that it is disturbing to watch her portray this controlling, twisted woman. The fact that the story is based on true events doesn't make this any easier to deal with. That being said -- if you are a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery you must not pass up watching Sins of the Mother!",1284940800,11,576,4.818181818181818
2542068,5,B000EWBNUU,This movie is based on actual events. Elizabeth Montgomery plays her part well. She will be missed.,1259020800,3,99,4.882352941176471

2542070,5,B000EWBNUU,"Am I the only one out there who sometimes finds the movies made for TV way better than the the ""films"" produced for theatrical release?  This one is one of the BEST! Elizabeth Montgomery (one of my favorites) stars in this TRUE story about a serial rapist (who happens to be her son) As the plot thickens - we see WHY  Kevin got to be like he was  - (protrayed to a T by Dale Midkiff - I like him too) He was a monster to be sure- but he managed to bring such  a vulnerability to his character! (A view that would be lost on his victims to be sure) His girlfriend Jenny tried in vain to understand him  and to help him but of course,  she has no idea of the man she is sharing a bed with! I don't know how much dramatic license was taken with  the actual relationship between the real mother and son - but this movie was so compelling and very entertaining!",1217116800,26,857,4.035502958579881
2542071,5,B000EWBNUU,"Sins of the Mother is a great movie starring the always fabulous Elizabeth Montgomery.  Her manipulation of her son is spell binding.  I recommend this movie to everyone, especially Elizabeth Montgomery fans.  Now, if the powers that be would only release onto DVD ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden!""",1205539200,17,295,5.104166666666667
2542072,5,B000EWBNUU,"I purchased this DVD recently. I was pleasantly surprised to find one of Elizabeth Montgomery's films on DVD at all!  I enjoyed this movie a lot. Elizabeth Montgomery does a wonderfully evil turn as Ruth Cole, an overbearing mother. Her son is no peach either!!  Wonderful to see ""Samantha Stevens"" doing serious acting as well as her comedic turn on ""Bewtiched"". I agree with the last reviewer who mentioned ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" as a most wanted title on DVD. Along with ""Lizzie Borden"" please accept my nomination for ""A Case of Rape"" as another possible new title from MPI Home Video.",1183334400,56,596,4.776699029126213
2542073,5,B000EWBNUU,"Hopefully MPI will continue to release TV Movies that feature our beloved Elizabeth Montgomery.  I would love to see ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" next in the line :)",1176422400,48,166,4.724137931034483
2542074,4,B000EWBNUU,"Why are all of Elizabeth Montgomery's films not on DVD (or VHS for that matter)? Amos was the only Liz movie ever put on VHS (how about the DVD, Sony?). What about Legend Of Lizzie Borden, A Case Of Rape, Second Sight: A Love Story or Between The Darkness And The Dawn, to name a few??? All of these films were released on VHS in the UK, why not here? I'll never understand how such a beloved star's work is almost impossible to come by. Sins Of The Mother is a good one. The quality of the DVD is pretty good (can't complain at that low price). Only flaw is a long blackout between one scene (a commercial break obviously). Sins Of The Mother gives Elizabeth the opportunity to play a real nasty role. Dale Midkiff is also very good as a tormented, almost pitiful rapist. Let's hope this is a sign that someone out there realizes IT'S TIME TO PUT ALL OF ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY'S FILMS ON dvd! Her fans want more!!!! PS- The DVD-- A Killing Affiar sold on Amazon is not her film-- it's another film with the same title (with Peter Weller).",1151884800,86,1037,4.323076923076923

2542103,5,B000EWBNUU,The mother of all mothers.  And Dale Midkiff was a delight to watch him play off Elizabeth's character.  They both went from hot and cold quickly.  A match made in hell.

2542106,5,B000EWBNUU,"This woman is a all time favorite of mine, and her late 80's into 90's were just excellently done. She was born from two movie star parents and learned her own style of acting. It's sad she passed in 1995, it hard to believe it's been that long...These movie based on true storys was a good way to end her career..

How far will a mother go?  Elizabeth Montgomery is excellent.
She's nothing like her Bewitched role of Samantha.  A truly wonderful actress.
Dale Midkiff is also brilliant as the belittled son/psychopath.",1392681600,,224,5.5588235294117645
2542110,5,B000EWBNUU,boy you really hate elizabeth montgomery in this movie....she plays a totally  evil woman and she does it well. well worth buying,1389052800,,129,4.863636363636363
2542111,3,B000EWBNUU,I was disappointed in the production.  Although the story was good the production was horrible.  There were long gaps of time that there was no picture and just a white screen.  Poor quality that looked to be boot leg.  I sent it back.,1387670400,,235,4.395348837209302
2542112,4,B000EWBNUU,"I bought the book ""Son"" by the late-great Jack Olsen, but have not read it yet.  I believe that it is better to watch a movie first before reading the book.

Like I've said before, almost everyone says, ""Oh, the book was so much better!"" when discussing film.  I find that to be problematic, because it's not entirely fair; it's comparing apples and oranges.  Books can be any length, although they are usually kept to 500 pages or fewer, while movies are usually condensed to two hours or less.  For this reason, filmmakers are often required to take liberties with a story, which doesn't bother me unless those liberties are taken for some political or otherwise unnecessary reason.  But if you read the book before seeing the movie, there is a tendency to nitpick with the film too much.  I didn't want to do that here.

Assuming that this film is fairly accurate -- I will know almost for sure after I read ""Son"" -- the story itself is definitely interesting.  Naturally, the film's position is something like, ""Don't only blame the son for his actions.  After all, his mother was a psychopath too.""  While the male lead here is very good, especially for a made-for-TV film, the movie takes a neutral-to-slightly-negative view of him, so most likely the position is fair.  After all, he has to be blamed somewhat himself; lots of ""sons"" have lousy mothers but don't sexually assault anyone.

And I've always been a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery, as I used to watch her on ""Bewitched"" when I was a kid.  She gives another nice performance as an unsympathetic character here, just like she did in the movie ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden.""  It's interesting to me that Ms. Montgomery so easily plays both good and bad characters equally; not many actors have that skill or range.  I wouldn't put her in that Meryl Streep category, but Ms. Montgomery is maybe only a couple notches below that.

I'm not convinced of the accuracy, but there is one scene where a friend of Fred Coe's agrees to dispose of some evidence before the trial begins.  For you kids out there, listen up:  never destroy evidence, especially for a friend.  That would be a no-no, and you just might go to jail if you do it while trying to save somebody else's tail.  If I had a ""friend"" that asked the same from me, he wouldn't be a friend for long, I will assure you of that.

I'll give a fairly strong recommendation, although I'm a little on the fence on that ""strong"" part until I read the book.  But I am looking forward to reading another good one from Mr. Olsen.",1380067200,,2538,4.554083885209713
