7989209,5,B000093NOU,"What can I say, I really enjoyed the whole series, espcially this volume of Wild Arms.  I was quite suprised that this volume did not contain any filler episodes (makes sense since this is the last volume) and mostly focused on the main topic: who did this to Sheyenne and why?  Each episode is action packed and the last two episodes get really serious.  The last episode was spectacular (and a bit sad)!! It's pretty much straight to the point and does not leave you hanging like other anime endings.  And for all those Irvin fans out there, he's in all the episodes.
Nonetheless, the animation still says smooth through out the series.  The extras are decent.  It includes ""Continous"" music video (background song where Sheyenne meets Lyla way back in volume 3), model sheets, the original Japanese preview, outtakes, and the ADV previews.
The music video contains scenes from the last two episodes, which is pretty nice and outtakes are always fun to watch.
To sum it up, this series was an awsome series to watch.  I highly recomend it! Also--to note--Sheyenne wasn't kidding about being a hottie..swoon!",1059436800,4,1109,4.835978835978836
