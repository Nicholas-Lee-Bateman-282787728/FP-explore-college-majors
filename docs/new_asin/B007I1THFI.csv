8517145,4,B007I1THFI,"This is about an experimental drug that's created to make intravenous drug users suicidal, but sometimes it can also turn a user into a homicidal maniac. Although not a very well known film, it delivers the exploitation goods. Within the first 10 minutes, there's a graphic and bloody suicide when a guy carves himself up with a butchers knife. This one event convinces his friends who witnessed his suicide to stop their drug usage cold turkey by locking themselves in an abandoned house and having one last drug binge in the place before quitting. There's some sexual content and nudity like a this really hot girl dancing topless in a thong, and it delivers the gore; although since this is just an exploitation film, throwing in some explicit full frontal scenes would've helped. I thought the directing was OK, but some may think it's below par, and the acting varies. Much of the film takes place indoors with no interesting scenery or effective atmosphere. I didn't think it delivered any effective claustrophobic type feelings, and some parts may be somewhat tedious to some because a lot of the film is just in this one house with you looking at the bland scenery and waiting for the next victim to be slashed up; you watch this low-budget digital video movie that was probably made with a Mini DV camcorder for exploitation. There isn't anything really wrong with its pace because it usually moves quite well, but the characters, atmosphere and scenery aren't interesting. Nevertheless, I bought it for exploitation and it delivered.

The Blu-ray looks nice. There's a worthless short that runs around a couple minutes for an extra. In this, a girl goes into a stall in the bathroom and gets scarred when she sees an intruder with a knife lingering outside; then it just ends. There's also a behind the scenes extra and trailers.",1438819200,,1839,4.838095238095238
8517146,5,B007I1THFI,Such a messed up movie. Definitely never want to try heroin. My fiance and I love thrillers like this. Had to buy the blu-ray because we lost our dvd copy somewhere. Totally worth it.,1417392000,,183,4.411764705882353
8517147,4,B007I1THFI,"A thrilling little gem!  A group of friends locked in the house with a homicidal maniac on the loose and a government agent looking to cover the whole thing up!  What more can you ask for?

Fun performances from the young cast, lost of scares and blood, glad i bought it!",1368316800,,271,4.2745098039215685
8517148,3,B007I1THFI,"When I bought this there weren't any reviews and it wasn't on Nflx so I figured I'd take the leap. I like drug movies and I love horror and it got a blu ray release, so it couldn't be that bad, right? Well... I could best summarize it as an instant play slasher flick that I'd never see again. I love horror, beginning with the silent classics, foreign horror- especially Italian horror and giallos, the heyday of horror in this country - the 70s and 80s flicks of course. I've mainly dug the foreign horror flicks. The French are always reliable, Spain is up there too, and Asian flicks have been outstanding.  And Serbia is busting out on the scene. Haven't you seen ""A Serbian Film uncut"" yet? Or ""Life and Death of a Porno Gang""? The US horror scene is heartbreaking since the 2000s, Rob Zombie not withstanding; 'Sinister"" comes to mind as a recent exception.

I've watched hundreds of mediocre to bad slasher flicks on instant play and I tend to be pretty forgiving. Hence my 3 star rating. What's it all about? The war on drugs, of course. A covert government plot to create and distribute tainted heroin that makes the user suicidal, in order to wipe out junkies goes awry. An unintended side effect is that the user becomes homicidal. A group of 18-21 year old friends gets a batch and all hell breaks loose at a secluded country house they are holed up in. You'd think that it would be an orgy of violence but really just 1 guy becomes the killer. If that's not bad enough, the scientist that is heading the special ops for the government is instructed to eradicate all traces of the bad batch and whoever got it (and to start over with the experiment minus the hoomicidality, of course). The production values are low grade but not as bad as some I've seen. There's really nothing special going on in terms of camera work. With a name like Psychotica, I thought maybe I'd get some surrealism/hallucinatory sequences but none of that happened here. Its pretty straightforward. Too bad it wasn't on instantplay so I could've satisfied  my curiosity without spending money. What bumped up my rating from a 2 to a 3 is that the concept is interesting and a more capable team could've really had fun with this one. If you are curious like me, your imagination of what the movie is like is probably better than the actual movie. Still, I've seen far worse. I give them credit for coming up with an original slasher backstory. A little pet peeve: One of the characters said ""We've all had bad trips"" (on heroin). Duh. You don't have a ""bad trip"" on heroin. That's LSD. Director, get a fact checker next time.",1365206400,,2612,4.529661016949152
