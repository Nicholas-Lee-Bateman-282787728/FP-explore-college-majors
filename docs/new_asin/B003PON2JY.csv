8402060,4,B003PON2JY,"I bought this video to show at our local humanist society meetings. It is a good basic introduction to humanism. Production values are not great, it was a bit dry for me, and I didn't agree with everything the presenter said, but overall it was pretty solid. It was the catalyst for an interesting and lively group discussion afterward. I would recommend this video for humanist groups to show to members and prospective members. We are going to show this again next month, and will probably show it every year or so as we draw new folks into the group.",1387324800,,553,4.54
