487236,5,6302587204,Clearly described film. My interest in fashion made me want the film since it was revealed that clothes were by a noted designer.,1116633600,3,129,4.6521739130434785
487237,4,6302587204,"Brook Shields plays newspaper reporter Brenda Starr, the glamorous heroine of a strip cartoon drawn by a slightly wet but amiable artist, who somehow manages to draw himself into the strip and finds himself sharing her adventures as they try to find a missing professor who has developed a secret formula to replace petrol and who is also being pursued by various baddies (well, something like that anyway).  The artist naturally has a crush on the glamorous Brenda, but romantic compications occur when gorgeous Brazilian aristocrat Basil St. John (Timothy Dalton in tight black trousers and an eyepatch,oh crikey, I'm drooling again)turns up, he's also after the formula, I think.  Look, I've watched this film three times now and I still don't really understand the plot, but who cares.  It's a lot of fun anyway, and with Brook Shields in tight skirts and Timothy Dalton in tight trousers it has something to please everyone.  True, there is a rather long bit in the middle of the film where Dalton isn't around, but you can't have everything, and the rest of the time, he's there, and absolutely divine.  Don't worry about the baffling plot and crazy characters, just enjoy it.",1086220800,14,1182,4.919597989949748
487238,5,6302587204,"Brooke Shields is more beautiful than ever in BRENDA STARR, a cute comedy-adventure-mystery based on the buxom comic-strip character.
As the journalist Brenda Starr, Shields has a ball.  In each scene, she is priceless, and ravishing in Bob Mackie's cavalcade of wonderful costumes.
Diana Scarwid also is wonderful, as Brenda's arch-rival Libby Lips.  Also of note are June Gable, Jeffrey Tambor, Tony Peck and Charles Durning.
Timothy Dalton, as Brenda's suave love-interest Basil St John, has charisma and charm to spare.  The adventure builds as Brenda travels deep into the Amazon to retrieve a miracle formula that could save or destroy the world.
BRENDA STARR was mauled by critics and audiences alike when first released.  In fact the film was delayed and kept on the shelf for 7 years before being officially released.  A decade later, BRENDA STARR has been re-discovered by new and old audiences alike as an enjoyable farce that doesn't need to be taken seriously.
Delightful viewing.",990316800,24,993,5.18125
487239,3,6302587204,"This movie is pretty much as awful as people say--but if you love that terrific, underrated actress Diana Scarwid (Mommie Dearest, Silkwood, Truman) as much as I do you won't be disappointed by her comedy performance as Brenda Starr's nemesis Libby Lips. Scarwid looks ten times more gorgeous than Sheilds and she definitely outclasses her as an actress. That garter belt scene is a classic!",986601600,,391,5.030769230769231
487240,4,6302587204,"Bad reviews cannot hold down a deliciously fun movie and a super campy script.  Brenda Starr is a wonderful little film that is silly for sure, but funny.  Brooke Shields never looked better and kids will love the action and the witty script.  No it's not some arty-farty Hollywood nosh-nosh thing, sorry on that count.  What it is is just an old fashioned funny movie worth seeing.  Rent it, buy it, see it; whatever. . . just sit back and enjoy.",981504000,6,447,4.469135802469136
487241,5,6302587204,I love all the pretty outfits that Brooke Shields wore in the Brenda StarrVideo.  I think that Brooke is one terrific actress as well as supermodel.,925948800,5,148,4.6923076923076925
487272,4,6302587204,"Nicely filmed fantasy based on the newspaper comic strip.  Brooke Shields as Brenda Starr is beautiful, though she is no great actress.  Timothy Dalton fits the bill as Basil St. John.  The production values are nice and Starr's costume changes are ""nifty"".  It could have used a better score.  Not in the same class as the film DICK TRACY but not bad, though kind of silly.  I ordered a used DVD which turned out just fine.  Recommended for fans of the comic strip.",1385337600,,466,4.542168674698795
487273,1,6302587204,In the information about this DVD it wasn't mentioned that it was in Italian.  So of course ti was useless when I got it.,1375747200,,121,4.041666666666667
487274,4,6302587204,A campy vision of the classic Dale Messick comic strip.  A fun adventure with some strange characters!  Brooke looks like Brenda!!!,1363824000,,131,5.190476190476191
487275,1,6302587204,I was very disappointed to receive this video and find it to be in Spanish. I wish that the retailer would make that very apparent on the website.,1361145600,,146,4.25
487276,2,6302587204,This was a poor choice on my part. I liked the actors but not the story and I didn't even finish watching it.,1356480000,,109,3.782608695652174
487277,4,6302587204,Brenda Starr was always one of my favorite comic strips in newspapers. So of course I have to have the movie also. Brooke Shields does a credible job and I always love Timothy Dalton. It's a fun movie not to be taken seriously.,1354320000,,227,4.3023255813953485
487278,2,6302587204,"Brenda Starr, 1987 film

It starts with a man drawing a cartoon strip about a newspaper reporter. It comes alive! There is a shoot-out between the police and Public Enemy #3. The scenes suggest the 1930s, an era when reporters were considered heroic persons who investigated crime and corruption in the big cities. Brenda Starr interviews O'Shea. ""You've just had some bad breaks."" ""They won't shoot a reporter."" ""Hold your fire."" There is a struggle and a fall. ""She's alive!"" Brenda dreams of ""Basil St. John"", her absent boyfriend. She hears bad news about her newspaper - salaries are being cut! Brenda returns to work and is applauded. Francis Liveright, the publisher, shows a movie about a scientific invention of a new power source. ""What was that?"" ""I'll find him"" says Brenda.

Brenda goes to Washington to talk to the President (who looks like Truman). That new power source can dominate the world! A man from Brazil visits Brenda to tell about Gerhard Kreutzer. Elsewhere foreigners listen to this conversation; they also want the secret. Brenda has been captured! Will she talk? She escapes and puts on a disguise. When her car runs out of gas she is rescued by Basil who tells about the Amazon and the black orchids there. ""Nobody is perfect."" ""Good Grief!"" We see the people at the other tables. ""What do they want?"" ""I'll handle this."" Brenda gets a surprise when she returns to her hotel room. She escapes her pursuers by taking a taxi ride, then a boat ride. Her photographer follows. But they are tricked and captured. Will she talk? No, the survival of the Free World is at stake! Can they escape the boat? Can they get a ride away from the jungle? Then they join a traveling carnival.

Brenda is forced to do a high-wire act. She calls for Mike. They escape again in a carnival truck with a steam calliope. Next Basil arrives in a boat. Brenda walks into a bar, the men's heads turn to watch her. Brenda meets Professor Gerhard Kreutzer, but he won't talk to her. They must travel by canoe now. Libby Lips arrives in a float plane. So do the Russians. They toss a purse around. Brenda uses her head and a lighter to set the water on fire! They escape from their pursuers. They use the secret formula to power a car for a getaway. But Libby and her pilot tie them up and take the secret formula. Brenda and Basil view the black orchids. Brenda learns about the flaw in that secret formula, and gets her scoop (and shows up Libby). Mike tells Brenda about his feelings for her. Was this all a dream?

It starts out with dramatic action. It has too much comedy for a drama, and the story isn't a funny comedy. The fault is with the producer and writers. ""Dick Tracy"" and ""Blondie"" created a series of movies, so you can adapt a cartoon strip to a movie (if done right). Perhaps the mistake was to take Brenda out of her big city environment. ""Nancy Drew"" had a series of movies set in her town.",1334016000,,2912,4.530418250950571
487279,4,6302587204,A good movie that captures the comic quality of the comic strip.  Brooke Shields is a true representation of Starr.  The other characters are like the comic just came off the printed page.,1287273600,,188,4.666666666666667
487280,5,6302587204,"Brenda Starr was a fictional character who appeared as the most fashionable of females, a news reporter, in a newspaper cartoon, from the mid-40's through to the current newspaper-to-comic book era. This movie was a real hoot!. It is an example of a journey into the fantastical world of the impossible cartoon, only surpassed by the current video adventures. If you fancy comedy, it is a funny movie. The sets are very well done, with the wardrobe the highlight of the foreground story. Brooke Shields is stunning,(of course), as well as athletic enought to romp and climb about as if she was truly capable of doing all the shenanigans depicted in the fictional drawings. This is a light-hearted, ""G"" rated, silly film. It truly must have been a trial to jump into the cartoon world, and portray an un-feeling line-drawing-character. It may not do justice to the skills of any of the actors, including Timothy Dalton, or Ms. Shields, but certainly it was an escape from Hollywood judgement.",1267574400,,991,4.904761904761905
487281,4,6302587204,"Brooke Shields is lovely, in this amusing and novel (comic strip characters come to life), action caper adventure. Tho critics diss the film, I think its goofy chases and comments by the characters are amusing to watch. Just sit back and enjoy the visual colors, and pretty, radiant Brooke Shields, who knows how to charm! It's just old fashioned movie fun and colorful capers.",1122249600,4,377,4.90625

I thought I saw a young NF from Castle in the reporters room. He was one of the guys carrying Brenda around when she returns from her adventure in the Amazon. I bet he's glad he was in a non credited role. Oh, yeah I saw this movie on TV,I didn't buy or rent it.",1411948800,,409,4.0
