8504430,5,B006U8WG2Q,Voyage to Amasia is a great film. It is a moving story of a family's experience during the Armenian Genocide and the legacy of that experience when the filmmaker returns to his ancestral home nearly 100 years later to explore his family's history and how the Genocide continues to affect relations between Armenians and Turks today.,1374883200,,332,4.946428571428571

8504433,4,B006U8WG2Q,"""Voyage to Amasia"" is a touching and very personal documentary about the family of one of the filmmakers, Eric Hachikian.  His family came from Amasia, a relatively prosperous enclave in Turkey that was about 33% Armenian and which others have called ""Turkey's Riviera,"" and lived there until they were forcibly deported in the death marches of the Armenian Genocide in 1915.  The filmmaker's grandmother was less than a year old when the Genocide started, but miraculously she, her mother, and several of their siblings survived, although other family members were killed.

The documentary traces the filmmaker's return to Amasia after the death of his grandmother, to whom he was close, to see the area that his family came from.  The filmmaker also hoped to find the family homestead, and to see what traces of Armenian life still existed.  The film was made around the time of the assassination of Hrant Dink, amid rising tensions due to the internal resurfacing of Armenian issues inside of Turkey.

The most interesting aspects of this documentary are the people that they meet along the way, from the translator, to a Turkish resident of Amasia (Mr. Gopce, as I recall his name) who with menacing hospitality explains  Turkish/Armenian relations and history with the standard Turkish distortions, to an Armenian family they find in a village outside of Amasia who explain the reality of life as scarce Armenians that live in the Turkish interior, to people they meet as they travel along the pathway of the deportations including some Kurds.  The journey ends up in Armenia, in a community that was named Amasia because survivors of the Genocide who were from Turkish Amasia settled in Armenia and decided to name their community after where they came from.  The comments of one of the villagers they talk to are touching, not just for what he says, but for the level of detail that emerges from his knowledge of the story of Amasia, of which he is not first-generation.

The filmmaker's personal journey is a bit less interesting, although others might respond to it differently than I did.

While this is not a masterpiece, it's a documentary well worth seeing if the subject matter interests you.  It definitely added to my knowledge of the realities of modern-day Turkey.",1351382400,4,2282,4.976315789473684
