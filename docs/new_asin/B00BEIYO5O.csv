5584756,5,B00BEIYO5O,Because it had such good camera work and the reactions were very real. I like how it makes you feel like your in the car with Selena and Ethan as the movie is going on. I dislike nothing. I felt like it was a perfect movie.,1377993600,5,223,3.869565217391304
5584757,1,B00BEIYO5O,"It has become painfully evident that the majority of musicians don't typically make for good actors - and many of them (with aspirations of taking Hollywood by storm) might want to rethink any sudden urge to start an acting career even before they start.  Clearly, there are several exceptions to that particular claim, since there have obviously been multiple success stories, including Will Smith, Mark Wahlberg, and Justin Timberlake.  But, just because certain musicians have the talent to make a ""hit"" record doesn't automatically qualify them for A-list stardom outside the world of music.  After all, most of Hollywood's top names had to work their way up through acting school before hitting the big time - so it's not really fair to them when musical talents, like Vanessa Hudgens, Julianne Hough, and Selena Gomez snatch starring roles in feature films.  In fact, it's a downright travesty and it's painfully evident in the new thriller, Getaway - starring Selena Gomez.

Directed by Courtney Solomon (Dungeons & Dragons), Getaway stars Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna - a former professional racecar driver that is forced into an evening of crime behind-the-wheel after his wife, Leanne (Rebecca Budig), is kidnapped.  Brent is contacted via phone by a mysterious voice (Jon Voight) that is holding his wife captive, and if Brent doesn't do exactly what he says - she will die.  Brent is given a decked out car, which contains several cameras inside and out to make sure he carries out a set of missions.  However, he takes on an unexpected passenger (Selena Gomez) along the way and is begrudgingly forced to work with the tech-savvy girl.

The clear-cut star of this film is not Ethan Hawke or Selena Gomez, but the sweet-looking Shelby Cobra Mustang.  Within the opening moments of the film, the paint job takes a pretty moderate beating and from that moment on, the film falls into a repetitive cycle of showing the exact same car chase sequence over and over.  For roughly an hour and a half, there's very little meaningful dialogue and a near endless amount of havoc and car wrecks.  At certain points during these chase scenes, the cut scenes become so distracting and borderline irritating to watch that it wouldn't be surprising in the least to hear viewers complaining about a headache when they walk out of the theater.  Yes, it's really that bad - and there's no one other than the director to blame for something like that.

I'll openly admit that Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite actors to watch.  In films, like Training Day, Great Expectations and Before Sunrise, he's nothing short of a pleasure to watch.  He has an absolute flare for the dramatic, but he always seems to fall short in action flicks - like Assault on Precinct 13, Lords of War, and definitely Getaway.  It's not fair to blame this film's blunders on his shoulders, since he essentially sits behind the wheel of a car for an entire film, occasionally spewing generic dialogue and trying to convince an audience that a young girl knows more about the world than he does.  This was a complete and total misuse of a talented actor, and this film would have surely been more interesting if Justin Bieber were in the driver's seat as opposed to an actor that's been nominated for an Academy Award.

For someone as young and as talented as Selena Gomez, it's shame she had to take part in this film and open herself up to the relentless criticism for such a poorly written character.  Not only is it a poorly written character with a weak back story and an absolute lack of substance - she doesn't even have a name in the film.  Sadly, there's very little doubt that any other young actress would have brought more to this role than Gomez.  But, she's not alone in the blame department.  A lack of substance is also the best way to describe the film's villain, portrayed by the normally brilliant Jon Voight.  His voice is very distinctive from the very beginning, and it becomes increasing tedious as he constantly repeats the same lines over and over again.  Plus, it didn't really make a whole lot of sense for this film to make a huge deal out of revealing who the villain turns out to be.  Once again, this is another case of an actor's talents being completely wasted.

The poor acting performances all go back to the terrible plot and even worse dialogue.  At no point over the course of this movie are any real motives given for why this film is even taking place.  It completely reeks of trying to be a new, slightly altered version of Taken.  Apparently, since Hawke's character used to be somewhat of a famous racecar driver, he should be an easy target for blackmail.  The motive of the villain is nearly nonexistent, other than he used to be a big fan and likes money.  And, let's not forget that there's nothing realistic about this film to begin with, either, including one drivers shocking awesome ability to completely avoid an entire legion of police cars.  You'd also assume that after all the driving he does, he would need to fill up his tank with some gas or get a flat tire from running over random things.  If only the cops were smart enough to just shoot his tires, especially since ""the girl"" took the time to point out that they can do that.  In the end, when all else fails, just wait for the young, tech savvy girl to work her magic and figure everything out.

If you haven't heard, Getaway has already been labeled as one of the worst films of the summer - and the year.  And, while this film certainly does have a massive amount of flaws, it's not necessarily as bad as it's made out to be.  Without a shadow of a doubt, this is a far cry from a good movie, but there are still far worst movies to watch.  Still, there's no point in debating that Selena Gomez is one of the reasons this film suffers mightily, but it's also due largely to the poor script, miserable directing, and lack of substance.  This film had a great deal of potential, attempting to combine Fast & Furious with Taken, but the experience massively fails from poor execution.  If this film were redone using a quality director and an experience Hollywood actress, this film could have been so much better.  Feel free to wait for a desperate Friday or Saturday night at home to give this film any of your attention.

5584758,1,B00BEIYO5O,"""Getaway"" looked like the type of film that had potential. Not to actually be a good film, mind you; heavens, no. ""Getaway"" had the appearance of a film that could have accidentally stumbled onto greatness while drunkenly staggering on the line that divides the really awful films from the so-bad-they're-enjoyable ones. Boasting that all of the destructive car crashes in the film are real and no CGI was used is certainly a feat in itself; it's also the only enjoyable aspect of the film that ""Getaway"" pummels into the ground far too often rendering the crash scenes meaningless in the short span of 90 minutes. Unless, of course, you enjoy the endless whining of Selena Gomez, Ethan Hawke shouting things at the top of his lungs frequently, and close-ups of Jon Voight's mouth as he eats and drinks. Then you're in for a treat.

Going into ""Getaway,"" expectations were that the film would be similar to ""Death Proof"" at its best or ""Drive Angry"" at its worst. The action thriller seemed rather up front with its intentions which is something you discovered just by viewing the trailers of the film and which also meant that the film would be nowhere near as good as ""Drive."" After witnessing the film's quick pace, high speed chases, and all around calamitous atmosphere, Dwayne Johnson's ""Faster"" came to mind. The homage and/or mimicry of other well-known car chase films wouldn't end there, but the point is that ""Getaway"" seems to borrow from other well-known films that came before it without really offering anything substantial of its own.

The film feels like it had nearly a dozen cameras set up to capture every possible angle during the action sequences. While many of these sequences are intense, volatile, and undeniably bone crunching, the editing nearly ruins every sequence. The film shifts from camera to camera so often that it becomes dizzying. Then there's the fact that ""Getaway"" never seems to keep one steady shot for longer than a three second period, so the hyperactive cameraman theory comes into play.

The absolute best moments of the film are when Ethan Hawke tells Selena Gomez to shut the hell up. Not only does Gomez seem to look down at Hawke's character for nearly the entire film, but she also leaves her mouth agape during every high speed chase, makes stupid comments while the cops are on their trail (""Stop! Don't! Quit it! Cut it out!""), audibly complains about everything, and is only thrown into the film to say, ""S#!t,"" as often as possible.

After finally getting trapped between a blockade and the closing in authorities, Magna executes an unbelievable maneuver that seems almost too easy and too illogical to even be considered realistic. Then there's Selena Gomez who seems to know so much about cars, computers, and state of the art technology that you wonder why things don't end sooner than they do and why her character makes such foolish decisions. These are only a few examples of how irrational the film can get at times, which makes it difficult to take seriously. You obviously aren't supposed to as every adrenaline pumping car chase is made to seem as loud as possible to make you forget about these things, but no matter how loud car tires screech or how many vehicles scratch up against one another and fly into the air ""Getaway"" is never able to distance itself from absurdity.

""Getaway"" is like a modern take of ""Speed"" (it even has the recording loop trick used in the 1994 film) blended with the ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" remake, but is ruined by a limitless amount of redundant car crashes and an annoying little girl.",1377820800,6,3586,4.814935064935065
5584832,3,B00BEIYO5O,Ethan Hawke top notch acting A+++++. Selena gomez acting is bottom of the barrel and when I say bottom she is under the barrel. Let's face it I bought this movie because Ethan Hawke was in it. Superman couldn't save Selena Gomez acting. I liked seeing john voight in this movie but I got tired of seeing his stubble and funky teeth he needed some Gillette and crest whitening.

5585067,5,B00BEIYO5O,Easily the best documentary about holiday driving I have ever seen.  Right from the beginning when Hawke has to fist fight a guy for a parking space through the next straight hour and a half of SUV drivers trying to kill him and just ramming into stuff; overall this film really catches the authenticity of what a average week night commute is like during the holidays.  One can really cheer for the hero when he literally runs rampant over and through the commercialization of the holiday and then finally takes out that SUV driver at the end.  Of course SPOILER it was just one selfishly bad SUV driver... but as our hero finds out the world is full of them!  (SEQUAL?),1449532800,,671,4.520661157024794

Unfortunately, I don't think the story was developed well enough to get enough traction for viewing with empathy.  I feel the story's introduction needed work, regardless of the challenge of making an introduction to attempt to make the viewer curious and get interested in watching the story.
  The story had the believability of the newer comic book films; there isn't any way the car could take the abuse, or that a the asset that was stolen (perhaps labelled as storage or a server in the film which was nothing more than a PC case with a bunch of lights) would be running and placed in a van of that nature.  Data is transferred over networks and as storage devices such as tapes or discs when transferred.  Computers typically are not used, and if they are, they would not be ""on"".
  If you want to watch a decent action film, I would actually watch the flick.  It isn't necessarily bad, but it seems like it has a lot of rough edges.

Lots of car driving stuff. Cop cars flipping and rolling and burning up. Often. Ethan Hawke's character is rather, uh, 1/2 dimensional. If I'd been him in the movie and had the chance to shoot Selena Gomez' character, I would have made the truly right decision and done it immediately, before the script (this had a script? Really?) change.

Lots of car driving stuff. Fast and often flipping over, flying through the air and crashing and sometimes flipping over and, oh yeah, cars burning up, too. Often. Ethan not doing much good acting, but the movie allows none to exist, so don't blame him.

Jon Voigt, actor. THE VOICE of this movie. Not very dislikable, because he doesn't give a crap about this stinker of a movie, either. I hate me for watching more than about 15 minutes of it. I watched the first 15 minutes of it and FF to the last 15 or so, thinking it would be less painful for me and my girlfriend to miss the ""guts"" of this movie, but the ending was lousy, too. Damn, I am in self-loathing mode right now and my girlfriend should be in loathing me mode for sharing with me the stupidity of this movie, but she is kind and deep and forgiving, so has let me off the hook.

It wasn't very enjoyable watching the car scenes because I felt like I was getting to see what was going on, then a zoom in of Selena's face and a one-liner that was usually ""S***"" or ""Oh my God"" etc.  I think the car scenes would have been better if they took out a lot of the one-liners and zoomed-in shots and just showed the viewer what was going on outside the vehicle.  You know, the actual car chase.  The car chases felt really similar to me as well.  Police cars and the other car.  Police cars crash.  Chase scene over.  The motorcycle chase wasn't very realistic to me.  I can't imagine it's easy to shoot at someone while trying to drive a motorcycle at high speeds.  Never having to reload your weapon must help.

Not expecting a lot, I didn't thought the movie was that bad, it's just that it lacks a substantial storyline; there were too many chase scenes, TOO MUCH action, and we barely get to know the characters (Hawke's character is a former racer that has his wife kipnapped, and Gomez's character is the daughter of a very wealthy man), that's all we know. And yet, the little backstory the movie has, ends up as a really messy thing... I'm not expecting an Oscar worthy story, but come on, they could have brought something solid. It seems like there was a lot of action in order to keep the movie without lines except without some screaming and random talking.

Former reckless race car driver Brent Magna's wife is kidnapped by the mysterious head of a shadowy organization, who threatens to kill her if Magna doesn't do exactly as they tell him. So, Magna steals a special car with protective armor from a garage and goes careening all over the streets, sidewalks, and parkways of Sofia, Bulgaria, outrunning dozens of cop cars and and causing many fellow drivers to crash. Along the way, he inadvertently picks up a passenger, ""The Kid"" (Selena Gomez).

Chase and smash-'em-up thriller fans should enjoy GETAWAY. Otherwise, there are not a lot of other reasons to watch it. The only reason I did was the unique setting: We get to see something of Sofia--it was partly filmed there--but not a whole lot, and most of the ""Bulgarian"" characters just happen to speak fluent English. I've noticed some criticisms of the acting, but it's not too bad for a film of this sort. Hawke does a decent job of playing Magna, and, although ""The Kid"" is a rather unlikely character, Gomez's nice performance helps make her as real as she can be. GETAWAY is set during Christmas season, and the ironic jingles in the soundtrack add some humor. The storyline does its best to make sense, but there are still many blank spots.

POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW!

--I kept wondering about the motivations of the kidnappers, and we're told a little something about them at the end. Still, it doesn't entirely add up.

--However, we're never told how many cops and fellow drivers die or are permanently incapacitated by Magna's little escapade, which is something of a cop-out. He also hurtles through busy parks jam-packed with Christmas celebrants but is such an expert driver that he miraculously avoids running down any pedestrians.

5586151,3,B00BEIYO5O,"Canadian director Courtney Solomon steers this `script' by Sean Finnegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker and the result is a relentless 90 minutes car chase move, a little on the over used side. Former race car driver Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is pitted against the clock as he commandeers a custom Shelby Super Snake Mustang, taking it and its unwitting owner `The Kid' (Selena Gomez) on a high-speed adventure at the command of a mysterious villain called The Voice (Jon Voight) on a race against time to save the life of his kidnapped wife Leanne (Rebecca Budig). The only thing that distinguishes the story from the legions of stories out of the same can is the `The Kid' knowledge of computers and hacking and GPS manipulation - throws an undated light on an old worn out story. Hawke is fine as the ever panicked-desperate-to-get-his-wife-back-obedient-to-the-Voice guy, Selena Gomez pulls off her rasty mouthed role well and all we see of Jon Voight is his mouth until the end. The final few minutes (the reason behind the whole movie) are rather silly. Grady Harp, April 14",1398124800,,1074,4.8743169398907105

5586153,1,B00BEIYO5O,"Normally when asked to sum up a movie with three-to-five words a person would assume to hear adjectives such as ""brilliant"" or ""engaging"" amongst other positive words commonly associated with establishing the fact that the film was worth watching.  However, in the case of the movie ""Getaway"", the best words to describe the film are nonsensical, in-cohesive, repetitive and bland.  In fact, the movie contains the perfect word to describe what the audience should do as soon as the film begins, they should ""Getaway"".....quickly.

The film script in ""Getaway"" makes Michael Bay look like Alfred Hitchcock.  The plot is severely lacking, to the point where I even found myself question whether or not there was a plot at all.  The movie consists of one giant car chase scene.....that's it.  Throughout the entire film the viewer never gets much background information as to who the villain is, what his motives are or what he even looks like.  Ethan Hawke's character is one dimensional and has no character development at all.  The audience doesn't know who he is or why his wife was kidnapped or how he ended up in the Mustang to begin with.  Instead, the movie begins with all of this already occurring prior to the opening credits and the viewer is greeted with a speeding Mustang out of nowhere.

The pace is consistent......it's one dimensional, so there's nowhere else for it to go.  ""Getaway"" consists of a man on the protagonist to crash into vehicles, to drive through parks, and to run from police within a given time limit.  That's pretty much the entire film except the director also added Selena Gomez to the mix, whose character adds nothing to the film either.  In fact, neither Hawke nor Gomez do much talking so the film would have been the same with just one character in the vehicle.

If someone is looking for a movie with action and car chases then anything other than ""Getaway"" would be a good choice.  Films like ""Transporter"", ""Bourne"", ""Fast and the Furious"", etc would all be more practical viewing experiences than ""Getaway"".  If you're just looking for fast cars being driven around a track without any plot or any acting or talking then I would also highly recommend any episode of ""Top Gear"" over this film since ""Top Gear"" is actually a great series and The Stig drives cars faster and with more character than the acting seen in ""Getaway"".  In the end, ""Getaway"" has no redeeming qualities that make it worthwhile.",1397779200,5,2447,4.815789473684211
5586154,2,B00BEIYO5O,"I took a look at this picture for a few reasons.  First, I like Ford Mustangs and this film, like the more recent ""Need for Speed,"" features a sizzling silver Shelby Cobra.  Then there is Ethan Hawke who was so brilliant earlier in the year in ""Before Midnight.""  Even after I saw the ""Tomatometer"" score of 2%, I thought how bad could it be?  Well, not only is the Mustang the best character in the film, it's probably the best actor too.  But acting really isn't the problem here.

The story, if you could call it a story, deals with a former washed out race car driver named Brent Magna (Hawke).  He's now living in Sophia, Bulgaria with his wife (Rebecca Budig).  After his wife is kidnapped, he's forced to drive the Mustang (not his) throughout the city with reckless abandon.  The car has been outfitted with cameras and a communications feed to the ""Voice"" (Jon Voight, seen only from the nose to the chin).  There seems to be no reason for putting large crowds at risk but Brent does what he's told because they threaten to kill his wife.

Along the way, a girl known as ""The Kid"" (not kidding) played by Selena Gomez (again not kidding) attempts to carjack what she says is her car, given to her by her rich, banker daddy.  She then becomes a co-pilot for Brent.  That's it, pretty much.  For about 85 out of the 90 minute running time we watch Brent and ""The Kid"" try to avoid killing people on the streets, parks, skating rinks, shopping malls, etc. and of course, with the police on their tail.  Director Courtney Solomon and crew manage to wreck a few dozen white BMW 3 series police cars along the way.

But for the record, the editing is sloppy, the script is ridiculous, the acting is non-existent except for the Mustang.  This film is so bad it makes the aforementioned ""Need for Speed"" seem Oscar worthy.  And by the way, this film has nothing to do with either the 1972 or 1994 films, ""The Getaway.""

Now if you still are interested in seeing the film, the Blu ray copy is pretty darn...uh, OK.  It has a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The biggest problem is consistency.  Scenes seemed to vary one to the next, albeit slightly.  The audio is acceptable as well with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The Shelby provides some nice rumble from the subs and the surrounds are often in play and the cars screech around corners.  There are French, Spanish, Portuguese and English SDH subtitles available.  There are 5 mini-featurettes which total 6 minutes (once again, not kidding).

5586386,3,B00BEIYO5O,"A decently enjoyable flick from Dark Castle Entertainment. A production company whose products swing from pretty dang good to yeesh - 'Getaway' falls somewhere in between.

Tells the story of Brent Magna, former NASCAR driver whose life hasn't gone right since a horrific crash. Unable to assimilate his near-death experience, he fell off the circuit. Washed out and broke, he turned his only marketable skill toward criminal enterprise. Likely to end up in prison, he's on the downward slope of self-destruction.

Then he meets Leanne. Love returns focus into his life. Back on the straight-n-arrow, they're going to make it work.

Until his wife is brutally abducted.

The Voice calls him with simple instructions. Do what he says, when he says it - and she lives. Disobey or fail - she dies. Of course he agrees to do whatever it takes to get her back.

His first mission - steal a very special car.

You already know the plot from there.

The tale is routine, the drama well-worn contrivance. But the set action pieces were really, really fun as we get to see a Shelby Super Snake Mustang tear ass through Sofia, Bulgaria. Explosions and insane road skills abound.

Despite the flat simplicity of the screenplay, I'm always surprised that we, the audience, have to once again confront that eternal movie pitfall: Internal Story Logic. Or lack thereof.

Several salient points that were critical to really enjoying this film stood out as distracting plot holes. Holes that viewers have to gloss over in order for the story to continue. Otherwise, you can get stuck pondering the ridiculousness of the script.

***Spoiler Warning***

Plot Problem No. 1 - According to The Voice he's fitted the car with cameras so that the driver can do nothing that The Voice cannot see. Makes sense. Until you think about how many lipstick cameras come equipped with audio function. Okay - the outside mounts you choose not to have audio. Again, makes sense. But the internal ones?

Plot Problem No. 2 - The Voice has GPS and can continually track his two little dupes. So why doesn't he notice when the pair deviates from the bank to stop and scope out the situation? On his screen the Mustang would be idle - while the video loop simultaneously showed them in constant motion. Durr.

Plot Problem No. 3 - If you've never ridden a motorcycle, then it probably seems completely logical that you could take on a car. But let me put it this way: If you have the world's most expensive and powerful motorcycle in the world - and went head to head against...oh... I dunno... say a Honda Civic. You're going to be bleeping dead. No motorcycle can win against a car. All it takes is the smallest of bumps, or worse, having the driver intentional run you down and run you over. Period. Two-thousand pounds of steel beats three-hundred every time.

On the flip side - there were amusing touches reflecting the generation gap. When Brent asks what might be at a bank worth killing over, he offers up 'negotiable bearer bonds'. To which the young lady incredulously replies, ""Bearer Bonds? What are you a dinosaur?"". So true. The type of bonds he's referring to haven't been used a means of finance since the 1980s. In fact, no financial institution has issued them for more than thirty years. But it's the typical movie trope that, amazingly, still gets used by lazy screenwriters. A nice touch by the filmmakers. <g>

Ms. Gomez's performance is solid enough. A few weak spots - but that can be attributed to the director's somewhat sketchy and illogical editing. (Note: I had never heard her speak prior this film; having only seen still images of the young lady with that Canadian performer)

Again, overall a decent flick. If you like fast car movies - this one is a winner. As I'm generally more interested in depth of plot and the skill of the artists - I'm torn between a high three and very low four. That last race sequence, about three minutes from the finale, was an absolute blast. No crashes or such, but the sheer skill of speed on display was very enjoyable. William Friedkin would be proud.

Call it a high three.

The action scenes defy logic so many times that they become tiring.  For example, Selena Gomez was in the passenger seat without wearing her seatbelt but she was not hurled into the windshield or the sides of the car as it slammed into other objects! She just kept on talking as if she was sitting in a chair at home!
Another irritating thing is the car got no visible damage even after it slammed into many other cars.

5586832,1,B00BEIYO5O,"I'll keep this review short by simply saying the Getaway is quite simply a direct to video film that was only released in theaters by Warner Brothers for two simple reasons with the first being the time of year it is. With a few exceptions mid to late August to early October is a wasteland of quality films, and just like in January to March studios release films that don't have the quality to compete against holiday films or compete with the summer blockbuster films as early as April. It is the same for films released in late summer to early fall. Audiences are experiences summer fatigue, going on vacations, and heading back to school. It is a perfect time for studios to release their castoffs that the studios don't know what to do with or don't have any confidence in to be put up against the summer blockbusters or the fall award quality films. It is obvious by their advertising campaign or lack thereof that Warner Brothers doesn't have any confidence in the Getaway and only released the film in theaters for the second reason the Getaway was released in theaters, and that is Selena Gomez. Warner Brothers obviously is hoping that action oriented film along with Selena Gomez's star power would help to elevate this obvious B level film at the box office to recoup the money that the studio invested in Dark Castles film.

How much does a roughly eighteen million dollar budget get you? Not much. It certainly doesn't get you a decent script which follows Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) an ex professional race car driver who gets forced by a voice over the phone to do a string of jobs in Sofia, Bulgaria in one night for some unexplained reason. That's the plot in a nutshell. It seems like Dark Castle was trying to find a way to film the Getaway as cheaply as possible, and it definitely shows during the film with the cheap cameras, endless close-ups, and bad editing. They force the two stars Hawke and Gomez to be stuck in a car for basically the entire film. Then Dark Castle didn't need to pay any actors outside of some extras playing police officers and bad guys or have one or two lines at most. Next Dark Castle executives and director Courtney Solomon had to think of a way to get Jon Voight without paying him full price with the answer being endless close ups of Voight's mouth, and only one actually scene with the actor at the very end of the film. I swear I've seen enough of Voight's mouth to last a life time.

The only two remotely redeeming things in the Getaway are the action scenes and Selena Gomez. Sure the camera angles and choice of camera shots isn't great the car chases and action is good and in a few scenes riveting. As for Gomez she is beautiful and talented women, and in the Getaway she is one of the few bright spots in the film out acting Hawk who just looks sickly and lost in the Getaway. Still I question Gomez's choice of roles. Gomez is gorgeous, has a large fan base along with being very popular, and well known with the general population, so you'd think the young woman would get better quality film roles or make better film choices than the Monte Carlo, Getaway, and Aftershock. Gomez does have some acting talent she just needs to choose more wisely what roles she decides to take.

Could the Getaway have been a good film? I don't see how. Not with a studio that was obviously trying to make the film as cheaply as possible, and certainly not with director Courtney Solomon at the helm who is the same director who directed that disasters that were An American Haunting and Dungeons & Dragons. Even with the star power of Gomez and decent action scenes the Getaway should have never been released in theaters, and sent directly to video and Redbox as it clearly isn't worth ten dollars to view in the theater, but might be worthwhile for a dollar fifty rent from Redbox.",1389052800,,3834,4.513669064748202

5586837,1,B00BEIYO5O,"This is a bad movie and I think those that made knew it so they didn't change the title.  Take their advice.  Selena Gomez must have known because her character doesn't even have a name.  The subtitles attribute her dialogue to the ""The Kid"".

Oh, and her dialogue consists mostly of ""Look Out!""  You see this is literally and figuratively a ""car wreck"" of a movie.  A guy's wife is kidnapped and he must drive for an hour and a half wrecking into things in France (Paris I think) or the bad guy on the phone will kill his wife.

The co-stars are Ethan Hawke's right hand, which he uses to shift the manual transmission, and his right foot, which is used to press on the accelerator.  Each of these body parts receives substantial camera shots to help reinforce the idea that Hawke is really driving fast.  Mix in some master sound effects -  revving engine and honking horns - and you've got about three quarters of the movie.

Thank goodness the car is indestructible or the movie would end in 12 minutes.  Hawke is able to slam into cars, boxes, street carts, trash cans, drive down stairs (couple of times), over train tracks, through parks, down alleys, through parking garages, weave in and out of traffic all while being chased by countless police cars.  To add to the excitement and intensity, Selena's character yells ""look out"" and the camera flashes to Hawke's foot and hand.  Oh,  let's not forget screeching, burning rubber to further drive up the realism.  Nothing stops this car.  Bullets, nope. Crashes, nope, Explosions, nope.  Oh, it gets multiple bullet holes but luckily none of the bullets hit the windows, lights, or tires.  Good thing because if the car stops, the wife dies.

Have to share this.  These guys on motorcycles are shooting away with their automatic rifles but can't seem to slow this miracle car down when Ethan grabs Selena's pistol and while driving down some type of train station platform, fires one bullet, takes out the bad guy who then crashes and causes a massive, massive chain-reaction explosion that miracle car speeds through.

Spoiler alert: Does the wife die?  Of course not. Does the bad guy get away? Well, guess what? He does!  I think the bad guy actually represents the people who made this movie because he tells Ethan ""You've helped me make a lot of money."" Then this unknown bad guy makes his ""GETAWAY""

I seriously doubt that they made a lot of money on this movie but they did collect $1.20 from me at RedBox and that was more then it deserves.  This movie is proof that studios could put out any movie, even one titled ""This is a horrible movie - GETAWAY"" and people will pay to see it.  The fact that I saw some positive reviews on this movie is actually bewildering!  My only satisfaction I had was the appreciation for how incredible insipid this movie is and realizing that the producers of the movie knew it too.",1388620800,3,2879,4.6031434184675835

Here's what ya get:

It's a 90 minute movie. Eighty minutes of endless, repetitive, boring chase-and-crash scenes occasionally interspersed with pieces of the 10 minutes of actual story.

If you like close-ups of Ethan Hawke's left foot stomping the clutch, followed immediately by close-ups of his right hand shifting gears, you'll be in Hog Heaven. Because you get to relive that particular moment of cinematic history about a hundred times.

This is like a video game... except you're only watching while SOMEONE ELSE is actually playing it.

Apparently the cops in Sofia, Bulgaria -- where the flick takes place -- drive Beemer cop cars. Well, first of all, the cops in Sofia are apparently set loose on the streets without one minute of actual driver training, if this idiotic movie is to be believed. And BMW must have had a record sales year, judging by the number of their products that crashed, burned, exploded, ran off bridges, plowed into rivers, hit other cars and trucks, and were otherwise completely destroyed.

This has to be one of the stupidest movies made this year, if not in history.

Brent Magna (Hawke) is a former race car driver who is forced to steal a car and complete a series of tasks in order to save his wife. When the original owner of the car (Gomez) jumps in he now has two lives to save. SO...where to start. First of all this was actually way better then I expected it to be. That said this movie is very overdone and was very very repetitive. A mix of Speed and Twelve Rounds or really just a remake of Vehicle 19. As generic as this movie was I will say that parts were exciting and entertaining but the movie is just way too predictable to be all that fun to watch. Again though the movie was better then I was thinking it would be. Selena Gomez is falling into the all to familiar trying to break out of Disney formula. Seems like any former Disney star trying to be taking as more adult does movies where all they do is swear or show skin. This movie is really just a put in and watch type movie which isn't always a bad thing. The filmmakers really did this a disservice by making this an R rated movie. If it was PG-13 the Gomez fans would have been able to see it and the movie felt geared toward that crowd. Overall, too old for teens and too young for adult.

5587203,1,B00BEIYO5O,"Going into this movie, I didn't have very high hopes for it. And that was knowing what the Tomato Meter said on Rotten Tomatoes. But hey, its a car movie, and since I own a 2006 Mustang GT, I will at least enjoy that part of it. Not quite. They even screwed up the car part of a car movie.

The acting was terrible. No chemistry between the two. The entire movie felt cheap. And it was because they used a million rear-view cameras. You know, the low quality ones that they stick on cars to see kids playing behind you when you back up. No joke. They used those cameras to film this movie. (look it up.)

For some reason the car also had an Xbox in it. Controllers in the door, and a console in the...console. Ok. I guess it was there for when the actors got tired of acting between takes. Because there was no other reason for it.

This movie could have been much better if they actually spent time in shooting it. Instead it felt like the filmmakers felt they needed to crash as many cars as possible, throw some cameras around, and film whatever happened. As someone who can respect a good action movie, no matter how bad the plot and acting is, this movie isn't even close to being respectable on any level. Picture a bunch of high school kids who have no experience in making a movie, and giving them a couple million to make a movie with. This would most likely be the result.

I'm not sure what the reason behind this movie was. Acting, cinematography, and editing were all very poorly done. They tried to do WAY too much, and failed so badly. I'm very confident that I could have directed this so that it would have been much better. And if the studio would give me a shot, I would prove it to them. I mean, they green lighted this crap, so they may as well give someone who has no real experience a shot.

So a recap. Someone who owns a Mustang, who wanted to see a cool Mustang movie, hated it. Go watch Death Race again instead.",1380844800,5,1939,4.22972972972973

5587205,2,B00BEIYO5O,"The opening of film gives you ""12 Rounds Reloaded"" deja vu. Former race car driver Brent (Ethan Hawke) must perform tasks from the voice of Jon Voight or else his wife will die. He is reluctantly aided by Selena Gomez, our pudgy faced Mila Kunis. Her attitude is perhaps the only highlight of a film consumed with Bulgarian car wreaks. Brent drives a custom Mustang Cobra. They are classically low to the ground and after he bounced over the first curb, the oil pan should have been toast.

Brent is a box of rocks and only the smart talking Selena can save the day, and maybe her car that he stole. Most of the film takes place in the car, making the film a bad combination of ""12 Rounds Reloaded"", ""The Chase"", and ""Vehicle 19."" If fast driving, car wreaks, and chase scenes is what you crave, the film has it all at the sacrifice of just about everything else. Brent has flashbacks of his wife being kidnapped, although he wasn't there. The bruise on his wife's head comes and goes. The Shelby has bullet holes in the side, before shots are fired at it. Like the bruise, the passenger's side mirror comes and goes on its own too. In the final chase scene it sounds like he up shifts the car about 12 times. It had me laughing. And if you didn't catch any of that, the final phone call, i.e. the reason why Brent was selected should have you shaking your head.

This film is action driven ""new school"" style of entertainment. People who like plot, character, drama, or a shower scene can avoid this film. Might make a decent arcade game.

I found this movie had way too much car chases with the police. It is basically the same thing over and over again. The driver runs from the cops, and the cop cars get damage or blow up. Then, the two get away, the cops stop chasing the mustang. Scene after scene of the same old thing. It's just too much!

If you really like a fast car action with hardly any story to it, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, you might want to pass on this one.
