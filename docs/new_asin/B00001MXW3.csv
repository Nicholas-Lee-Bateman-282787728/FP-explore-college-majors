7914466,5,B00001MXW3,This ranks as one of my favorite Christmas stories.  It is a very enjoyable family show.  One of my favorite scenes is where Santa (Harry Frazier) is disappointed that people don't seem to care about Christmas anymore.  He makes a great Santa; the kind that your remember from your childhood; the kind of Santa we used to love to believe in.,1201651200,2,341,4.557377049180328

It's really christmassy and is best watched on Christmas eve because it makes you feel all warm and excited about christmas.
(...)It's about an elf who basically saves christmas!
To love this short tale you need to be a christmassy person and love everything about christmas.
It's a must have for anyone of any age. BUY IT!!!!",1007510400,4,493,4.311827956989247
