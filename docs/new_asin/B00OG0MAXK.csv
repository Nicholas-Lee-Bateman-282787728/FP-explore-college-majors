8683440,2,B00OG0MAXK,It isn't for small kids. I was looking for something fun to get my daughter active since it's so hot outside. She couldn't keep up. The dance moves aren't great,1500422400,,160,4.366666666666666

8683442,2,B00OG0MAXK,"Bought this for my 9 year old daughter who loves to dance & loves music. She was excited to try it out but wasn't thrilled with this dvd at all. She kept it on & tried it out because she felt bad that I bought it for her but didn't make it to the end before she said she just really didn't like it. Big disappointment, waste of money for me :(",1488844800,2,343,3.7777777777777777
8683443,1,B00OG0MAXK,"This video has various moves for kids but what I don't like about it is that they have a move called the ""old man"" in which they are making fun of older people with back problems. Additionally, Mrs. Blanks is super annoying. IF you do decide to buy it you will soon find that this must be played on mute or it'll drive you crazy.",1483315200,,329,4.076923076923077
