7874702,5,6304474490,"This is definitely one of the best wildlife videos I have ever watched. It's extremely well-shot and has a very coherent story line, but that's not why I have ranked it so highly. It's because this video has action scenes that will chill you and have you literally on the edge of your seat while watching it.

The film follows two different sets of cheetahs around as they hunt, lounge around and generally go on with their lives. One set is three brothers who are absolutely menacing, the other set consists of twins - one brother, one sister. There's also some footage of a mother with her cubs who are joined by a stray adolescent that wants to band with them so as to have a better chance at surviving. The film has gripping footage of the interaction between these sets of cheetahs and also some incredible hunting scenes.

My wife and I watched another National Geographic film called THE FILMMAKERS - that one follows different wildlife filmmakers around on location and gives you a deep appreciation for how incredibly hard it is to shoot these kinds of movies.

Buy both these movies if you are into wildlife films. You will not regret it.",1125360000,4,1148,4.617647058823529
7874703,5,6304474490,"This is a remarkable look at the cheetah.
Hostilities from lions and hyenas are touched upon, but the video's focus is really on the cheetahs' relationships with eachother.  We follow three groups through a rainy  season on the African savannah - a mother and her cubs who join up with a  young female for mutual hunting benefit and companionship, male/female  twins who have left their mother but have a year to go before they can be  successfully independent, and three young brothers who terrorize them all.
The footage of the three brothers stalking in perfect symmetry is simply  unforgettable.  You'll be on the edge of your seat when they finally face  the twins, with the outnumbered young male's life depending on their mood  de jour - and his sister's sexual maturity or lack thereof.  This is one of  the greats.",963014400,14,823,4.807142857142857
