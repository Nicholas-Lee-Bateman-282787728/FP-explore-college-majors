204803,2,381409011X,"This series has its moments, but in the last two episodes just fizzles out.

The usual weaknesses of these series (regular bursting into tears, irritating off-stage singing accompanying every ""romantic"" moment) are again to the fore. The ending, with everybody making up is particularly absurd. Both the male and the female protagonist (especially the former) are mostly driven by events, only occasionally developing some initiative of their own. A bit of a waste of time, because entirely predictable after the first two episodes.",1418947200,,532,5.409638554216867

204806,5,381409011X,"Kim Tan is the illegitimate son and one of the heirs to the Empire Group. He was sent to the U.S. to study a few years ago by his older brother, because he was a threat to his brother's inheritance of the company. Since Kim Tan loves his brother, he reluctantly agreed.

Hard-working Cha Eun Sung, works many part-time jobs, but always dreams of a better life. She lives with her mute mother who is a maid to a wealthy family. Her sister lives in the U.S. and is about to get married. Eun Sung, exhausted with her poor lifestyle, plans to abandon her mother and run away to the U.S. and live off of her sister and her husband. When she gets there she finds out quickly that her sister was lying. Her sister and her argue fiercely, but her sister goes through her luggage and takes her money and runs away leaving her to cry in the middle of the sidewalk and stranded in Hollywood, barely able to speak English. However, Kim Tan just happens to overhear their argument. Later on that day, he helps her out of a few jams and she ends up staying at his house. Kim Tan starts falling for her and tries to subtly get her to stay. But his fiancee, Rachel Yoo, (It's a prearranged marriage) shows up and things don't go so well. But Eun Sung is able to get back to Korea with the help of her childhood friend.

When Eun Sung returns home, she finds out her mother moved in with her boss as a live-in housekeeper. Her mother is able to convince the mistress of the house to let Eun Sung move in. But she soon finds out when Kim Tan returns to Korea that the house she is living in is his family's. This makes life at the house interesting and complicated. What's more, is that Kim Tan's father enrolls her into his son's school with a hidden agenda. The school is filled with very wealthy heirs to their family's companies. The school has a hierarchy of four different classes, the bottom class is the Social Care Group, which contains a few students who got in by being a low-salary employee's child for one of the wealthy family's. Those in this class are looked down on and bullied mercilessly. Eun Sung and her childhood friend just happen to be two of those students.

Not only is Kim Tan trying to win Eun Sung's heart, but Kim Tan's rival has his eyes set on her too, but has a horrible way of showing his feelings. He constantly bullies her and Kim Tan tries everything to protect her.

This is a story about a group of wealthy high school students that are being trained to take over their parent's businesses. Rich heirs don't have it as easy as it looks, they struggle through life with their parents making every decision for them not only in business and socializing, but their love lives too. Kim Tan and Eun Sung are two young people that are trying to fight the restraints of social classes and overcome life's obstacles to be together. But are they brave enough to endure or will they get scared and run away?

Heirs is such a great and entertaining Korean Drama. If you like ""Boys Over Flowers,"" most likely you will like this drama. (Actor who plays Kim Tan was in the drama, ""Boys Over Flowers."") It's full of romance, emotion, humor, endearing and heartfelt moments, and good fighting scenes. It has interesting likable characters and a story to match. The two main actors have great chemistry. And Eun Sung's mute mother is so funny with her actions that I laughed-out-loud a lot. I couldn't stop watching. It's a very addictive show. The drama is full of popular actors and singers and many of which have songs on the soundtrack, including Park Shin Hye and Lee Min Ho, who play the lead roles. The songs are sweet, touching, and fun. There full of emotion and added so much to the feeling and attitude of the drama. I highly recommend this Korean drama and soundtrack.

204807,4,381409011X,"Love this DVD set! High quality video clear subtitles. My only issues were at times there weren't subtitles for the dialogue leaving one to guess what was said. Also in one of the DVD's there is a section where an entire sentence isn't English subtitle but another language (Korean?) and not able to change it to English I suppose due to it being translated that way from the beginning. I would like to have a set that had all the dialogue with subtitles and corrected sentence however not sure if I returned for exchange I would receive a correct set.
Having said all that I love this drama and would highly recommend it even though I had to deal with a few glitches.",1474416000,,668,4.439024390243903
204808,4,381409011X,"This another Korean TV show well worth the watch.  Lee Min-Ho is always great, though this seems like a spin off of Boys Over Flowers in part, but Kim Woo-Bin's character and the way he plays it elevates the story.  Kim Woo-Bin is dangerous and angry but from the start you know there is more to him.  The facts surrounding his life and his relationship with Lee Min-Ho's character evolve slowly but it is all there in Kim Woo-Bin's portrayal.  This makes the series electric.  It takes a very long time for the heroine to rise to her situation but the presence of the two fine man actors keeps everything moving.  Lee Min-Hos mum, played by Kim Sung-ryung is very good. And really was Miss Korea.  Which is an in joke in th film.",1471478400,,730,4.402985074626866

204814,4,381409011X,"The volume is really loud  and there is some static during the opening credits.  I also wish each episode was divided into 3 segments, so one can jump to a certain segment instead of watching the entire episode--not that I really mind seeing LMH!  It would have been great if some BTS/NGs were included.",1436140800,,303,4.574074074074074
