8354675,5,B0027FG1TU,"I would probably love this film even if I were not the star and Ken were not my brother. It is completely his project from start to finish, and I have always been a fan of his work, so when he came to me with the idea to interview me and follow me around a few of my favorite cemeteries, I put myself completely in his able hands. This release coincides with the publication of my book and I think makes the perfect companion to LA's Graveside Companion. So pull up a seat, grab some popcorn, smoke em if you got em, and join us on this brief tour of the Famous, the Infamous, and the Just Plain Dead.",1252972800,3,601,4.0588235294117645
