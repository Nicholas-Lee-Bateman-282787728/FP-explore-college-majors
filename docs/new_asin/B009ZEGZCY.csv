8545649,2,B009ZEGZCY,"I was surprised that many of the videos are already posted on either YouTube or Vimeo. And for the most part they are disappointing. There are a few that were cleaver ""Right Hook"", ""Confessions of a Pedalphile"" (which if you Google, carefully, you'll find it too is already posted on the web), and 1 or 2 others.

As we watched we kept saying ""I could do something better than this."" Probably couldn't, but still was not very good.

Using Steve Auerbach to promote this gave me the hope this would be good based on his excellent work from Bicycle Dreams. I am disappointed.

I'm going with 2 stars instead of 3 because I paid 20 dollars for free content on the web.",1388016000,2,665,4.434426229508197

8545653,1,B009ZEGZCY,I have two other movies from this company and have enjoyed them both. This one wss a disappointment. It is an eclectic collections of bicycle relayed films. I was entertained for the first five minutes and found the rest to be a bore. Not worth the $25.00.,1360540800,,256,4.468085106382978
8545654,1,B009ZEGZCY,"Totally disappointed by this collection of short films. After watching a few of them I kept hoping there would be a good one, but there never was. Some of them (alot of them) were just totally stupid! As a bicyclist I was hoping for something of substance. In my opinion... it's a waste.",1356998400,,287,4.433962264150943
8545655,5,B009ZEGZCY,"This movie cracked me up from the beginning to the end.  It's hilarious.  It was different than what I expected, but a nice surprise for the avid cyclist whose looking for a little fun.  The people are very talented and it will keep you rolling in the floor plus show you some genuine cyclist who can do more than just pedal down the road.  Well worth the money and would be great for a party.",1355011200,3,393,4.2
