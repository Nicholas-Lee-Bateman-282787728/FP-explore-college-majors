Every once in a while you have to watch a movie so bad that it makes you truly appreciate all the others, this film is that one. The movie ""Director"" is a low budget action flick with very little action or anything else. An ex-stripper, who calls herself the Director just because she carries around a little hand held camera, hooks up with some French thieves. She films their heists with the intent on making a movie, which actually might be better than this one, it can't be worse. No talent, no plot and more driving montages than ""Days of Thunder"" makes this film a must-miss.",1280102400,,673,4.608333333333333
