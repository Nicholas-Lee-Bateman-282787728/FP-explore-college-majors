8133455,5,B000GNOSC2,"What a movie. This is one of the best post war German movies I have seen. Right up there with Fassbinder. Though shot in the early 90's, this film depicts underground life, and gay life in cold war Berlin like few other films have done. Outstanding individuals, though broken by various forms of abuse and the resulting addictions, attempt to create an alternate living community inducive of handling these kinds of psychic/emotional scaring. Michael Stock is giving an incredible performance as the fractured survivor, hopelessly juggling love, reenactment of traumatic sexual encounters and his heroin addiction. The life they all share is observed by a child. Harshness rules wherever you look. Yet love attempts to prevail, fruitlessly. Rarely does a downward spiral movie show the unfolding of human psychic/emotional injury while attempting to live a somewhat functional life. There is no drama without purpose. Though depicting the 80's feel of underground Berlin, this movie is timeless. The puppet theatre the children flock to, in the make shift shelters this community has created, tells the story of a gay prince from yesteryear, longing to be allowed to live his same gender love relationship in all openness. The middle ages theme grants a kind of vileness that fits perfectly to describe the torments and search for a way out of a hopeless situation. To no avail. Death follows those that cross the edge into the abyss. The film ends with the rage of the child expressed, holding one of the adults, rightfully, responsible for the misery, the child has been exposed to. Is there healing from so much abuse and torment? Is there a way out besides numbing the pain and acting on traumatic triggers from a tortured past? Few directors dare to approach heavy subject matters like these. And even fewer would act the main part themselves. Hats off to Michael Stock who has created an invaluable piece of film history for generations to come to witness and analyze. More power to him!!!",1437609600,,1995,5.0120481927710845
