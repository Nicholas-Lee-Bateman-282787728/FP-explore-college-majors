8213315,5,B0000687EO,"If you like rally cars just buy it already!!!

Tony Mason is great, the included selection of cars is comprehensive and the video quality is acceptable (it is after all pre-HD).

You won't regret getting this. If anything get it for the quality footage of the audi and Peugeot going up Pikes Peak.",1244505600,,297,4.584905660377358
8213316,3,B0000687EO,"Most of this DVD is okay, even if there is a disproportionate amount of attention placed on the Fords... But the single best reason to get this is that it contains nearly the entire famous 'Climb Dance' sequence of Ari Vatenen's Peugeot at Pikes Peak. Having that 5 minutes of film on DVD makes the whole disc worthwile.",1051488000,10,320,4.5344827586206895
8213317,2,B0000687EO,"I was let down by this. The footage, although rare, is constantly repeated. I did not find the commentary overly exciting and the sole commentator is rather montone in his delivery.  There is a lot of great information on this DVD but it's not something you want to entertain with. If you are a real hardcore rally racing enthusiast you may enjoy it.
If you're looking for exciting footage and rally race commentary you're better off taping the WRC (World Rally Championships) off Speed TV.",1042243200,17,490,4.764705882352941
