8464229,5,B002WNU0JE,"What an amazing night! Howard Jones is truly a genius when it comes to the keyboard-in any style-electronic, acoustic, reggae, jazz, pop, symphony, and even ""heavy metal lite"", just a few of the ways he has presented his classic and timeless tunes over the years. This concert celebrates Howard's musical career that has lasted 25 years and counting and features many special guests, including Duncan Sheik, Nik Kershaw, Nick Heyward, Robin Boult, Nick Beggs (Kajagoogoo) and even an appearance from Jed Hoile (the mime from the early days). If you couldn't make it there in person, this is as close to being there as you can get (without actually being there)and no Howard Jones collection would be complete without it.",1263427200,,720,5.008333333333334
