7956278,5,B00005V8V9,Best football satire out there. Hilarious start to finish.,1517529600,,58,5.555555555555555
7956279,5,B00005V8V9,"I've seen this film dozens of times with my mates.  It is the funniest movie ever.  If you don't follow international football (soccer), a lot of it might be lost on you.  But if you are a football fan and have a sense of humour, you'll love it.

It is a UK disk, and it doesn't play on all American DVD players.  I have to use my laptop.",1376611200,2,338,3.911764705882353
7956280,5,B00005V8V9,"If you're a fan of the English Premier League, the World Cup or just soccer in general, you will really enjoy this film.

It has many of the elements of soccer management in a very humorous style, and is well worth it's cost!  Just make sure that your
machine can play it though- it's for Region 2.",1373068800,2,298,4.2105263157894735
