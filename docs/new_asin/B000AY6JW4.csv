8080398,2,B000AY6JW4,"The narration was not my favorite. And I wasn't sure if I was relieved or annoyed that the run time was a scant 29 minutes. But, like the other reviewer, I did enjoy Erochica Bamboo and Kitten DeVille. I love burlesque and I really wanted to like this, but I didn't.",1184630400,2,266,4.235294117647059
8080399,4,B000AY6JW4,"If your into T&A, plastic dolls, and hardcore porn then this probably isn't the movie for you. Camp Burlesque was a wondeful film that I stumbled upon. You can tell that Marsico did his homework on one of america's lost genres. One can see traces of early stripper films from the 50's and 60's which featured the likes of Blaze Star and Beau Brummel. Also, I'd say that the  filmmakers were tapping into the sexploitation films from the  master Russ Meyer. It's a fun film perfect for the collector or great for a bachelor party gag. The soundtrack alone is pretty amazing... Matthew Sweet, Dave Alvin, Peter Case, Bob Dylan and the Cruzados! . Just my two cents.",1141257600,7,663,4.610169491525424
8080400,2,B000AY6JW4,"I am a HUGE Burlesque revival fan, and was elated upon finding this Dvd (and the accompanying book). However, the production values are very, very low, and the narration is intrusive and boring. The entire Dvd is around 30 minutes total--so short, with little explanation as to how or WHY it was made! Some of the filmed segments seem to be quite funny, but almost none of them have the original sound, just the dull narrator. Just as you are getting interested, or just annoyed, the movie is over. Really just an amateurish short film on a shoe-string budget. The only reason to buy this movie is to see Erochica Bamboo and Kitten DeVille--otherwise, just take a trip to the Miss Exotic World Pageant in Helendale next June--you'll see more camp AND more Burlesque!!!",1132531200,10,768,4.7388059701492535
8080401,5,B000AY6JW4,This DVD was pretty cool. If you're into tattoos and burlesque you'll dig it. There was tons of special features besides the movie too and a cool soundtrack.,1128988800,2,157,4.642857142857143
8080402,5,B000AY6JW4,This movie is BANANAS! If you dig the new burlesque scene you'll love this short film. It stars a lot of the girls that you see on the circuit today and has a really cool soundtrack. Now I just have to figure out whether I was had or not. Is there REALLY a Camp Burlesque?,1127174400,,272,3.963636363636364
