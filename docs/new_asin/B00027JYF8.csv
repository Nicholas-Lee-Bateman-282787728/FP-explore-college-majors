2065153,5,B00027JYF8,"My son (4.5 yr) really love Real Wheel series. We already have some of the series in tape. But my son love them so much, we decide to buy the whole set in DVD. After receiving the DVD, my son still watched at least 3 times of each vedio. Highly recommend if you have a boy from 3 to 5 yr old.",1189555200,,292,3.725806451612903
2065154,5,B00027JYF8,"all of these real wheels dvds are great.  my son is 3 1/2 and he is very into school buses, trains, boats, etc.  the clips aren't too long (about 3o min.) and they hold his attention from beginning to end.  the movies are also informative and educational.  we now own all of the videos.",1168300800,,286,4.2407407407407405
2065155,1,B00027JYF8,I have been greatly dissppointed by the whole series. I ordered three DVDs at once and am stuck with them. They don't hold my son's attention at all which is fine with me because Dave and Becky are so annoying anyway I couldn't stand it if he could. Way better choice would be the Fred Levine series or the I Love CAT Machines series. Don't waste your money on these.,1161907200,2,367,4.257142857142857
2065156,5,B00027JYF8,"He asks to watch this several times a day and even when we're not home, he asks to see it when we get home!!  It keeps his attention the entire time it's on.  Highly recommend this entire series of videos!! We have them all!!",1141862400,,225,4.090909090909091
2065157,1,B00027JYF8,"I'm quite fond of the many 'reality' videos that have been created for toddlers. They give kids a chance to see the workings of the real world, learning how things work and what people do for a living.

I've seen other videos in this series, and they've been OK -- that is, entertaining and informative enough to let my kids watch them. With that as background, I decided to buy this one since we'd never seen it before. Unfortunately, that was a mistake.

These videos are not for teenagers; indeed, I don't think that the normal teen would sit through a full showing of one! They're for kids perhaps as young as 2, and as old as 8. So, why would 'Dave' end one of the segments with a statement to kids that they should stay off of drugs? In the segment on helicopters, there's a good deal of material on gunships and weaponry. At one point, Dave stresses the power of one of the helicopter's guns. There are many other uses of helicopters that could have been covered in this video, without resorting to war and military purposes.

Remember: we're dealing with a Target Audience of 2-8 year olds!

It's hard enough to protect our kids until they're old enough to deal with issues of war and drugs -- we don't need to support videos that undermine our values, or force our kids to deal with these issues at an unnecessarily young age. I am really disappointed by this video, and strongly recommend against supporting this childrens' producer. They could have done a wonderful job with the topics included here -- but they've really let us parents down!",1135641600,8,1553,4.555555555555555
2065158,5,B00027JYF8,"My daughter and I just finished watching this DVD and absolutely loved it.  Not only did this DVD keep my daughter giggling through the whole feature, but I was entertained as well.  This DVD really encourages an interactive viewing experience, which is something all parents should consider with the amount of television our youngsters watch.  Great information, fantastic visual clips of all sorts of boats and planes, and even greater characters.  Well Done.",1123372800,3,461,5.273972602739726
2065159,5,B00027JYF8,"Children love adventure and what better way to get their little hearts pumping than with a fun, fast-paced adventure involving boats, helicopters, mail carriers, and of course, fun Dave?

This is a great, safe film for toddlers and would make the perfect stocking stuffer!",1099353600,5,272,5.181818181818182

Dave and Becky, the stars, keep the fun rolling with an energetic pace and sometimes I find myself stopping to watch when I should be doing house chores.
