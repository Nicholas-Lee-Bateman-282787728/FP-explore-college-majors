8083909,4,B000B9RKOY,"The film has a witty plot. It has all the ingredients common to every De Funs films: He is rich and mean, while his employees are cool. Besides, he mimes a lot in this film, and this is a delight for his fans. The scene of the mass in the town church is unbeatable. There are also good secondary actors like Michel Galabru.
In the whole, one can say that the first half and the end are very good. The rest has a rather poor text.",1266192000,,429,4.0
