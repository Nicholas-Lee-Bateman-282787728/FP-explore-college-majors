8191741,5,B000PIBL7S,"Personally I always found the G-Force series of Godzilla movies the best, it only makes sense in a world where Big Gs presence is a reality an international force would be established to monitor, and (hopefully) control the Big Fella; given a somewhat more reasonable starting premise, the G-Force films all have better writing, (and in the Japanese editions) much better dialog than we expect from the more cartoonish early 60's Toho offerings. I own every film released between Raymond Burrs, and Godzilla 2000; I really love this edition of this Big G. classic,

The Special effects are actually very good, and the subplot where-in G-Force is betrayed by triad operative who hopes to sell his research as a weapon, is again pretty good and rather convincing. The subplot concerning the growing attraction between Lt Shinjo
and Dr Saegusa,Shinjo; is actually quite touching; and Akira Emoto's portrayal of Major Akira Yuki as a man driven into obsession by the death of his best friend in a fight with Godzilla is rather good. This is a Godzilla Movie, the Plot and writing are at the end of the day is a bit comic, book; but it is a Good Dark Horse; Frank Miller, comic book. level of writing; at least in the Japanese edition, the English edition is simply awful by comparison

The closing credits are accompanied by a really beautiful song in Japanese; and while I don't understand a word; the pure beauty of the voice is really quite Haunting; and the closing credits are of my favorite things about the film.",1394064000,,1515,4.778625954198473
