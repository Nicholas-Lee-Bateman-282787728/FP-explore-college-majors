Since I was not expecting to be entertained, I actually found this DVD to have value. The presenter does not have a big personality, but this is good instruction on how to play the ukulele by reading music. If you have no experience reading music, I would rate this as moderate in difficulty. I liked it!",1332979200,2,422,4.2875
8414666,1,B0043CT962,"Whoever said there is no such thing as a grumpy ukulele player hasn't seen this one.  The instructor looks and sounds like a mathematics professor.  His ""lecture"" is on music theory and how to read music.  He could really be talking about almost any stringed instrument.  Give this one a miss.",1309737600,3,293,4.686274509803922
