8529695,2,B008QP3RDI,"I found this to be a very disappointing.  The actors seem to be acting, the scripts and the plot lines seemed overblown and very coincidental, such as a bank robbery that involved 2 people working at the bank; and then the bank robbers just happened to cause a car wreck involving 2 other people who happen to live on the same street.

I could see how this series may have been enjoyed, if it was an early production for Aussie tv, as it ends nearly every episode with a cliffhanger; but that loses its impact on a DVD.

I found the theme song irritating.

I do not recall foul language, for the most part; and sexual relations are implied in a few instances, but there is no graphic nudity or anything like that.  The stripper who rents the room next door dresses like reform Amish.  The fact that she is a stripper (the kind that entertains at bachelor parties) is the most salacious aspect of this show.  But you are not going to see her anywhere close to nude.  I get the impression that, when the tv industry in Australia was heavily censored that this was a show which tried to push some boundaries.

On the plus side, this show is not anti-family or anti normal relationships, apart from the stripper who may or may not sleep around.

You could possibly enjoy this show with your young teens.

I have not completed series one yet; and it is very possible that I will become bored with this series and begin watching something else.",1472601600,,1438,4.429657794676806
