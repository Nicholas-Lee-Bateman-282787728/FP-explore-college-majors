8132411,5,B000GI3KMG,I teach elementary art and the kids learn about Egypt in second grade. This video shows in illustrated form how mummies were made. This was suitable for a second grade audience. It then traveled to a museum and a showed real mummies and how they are preserved. My students favorite part is the middle where a forensic artist reproduces a face from a model skull.,1482105600,,362,4.584615384615384

8132414,5,B000GI3KMG,"I grew up watching Reading Rainbow and now that it is included on Amazon Prime Video my 3 youngest watch it too!! We bought this one to take on vacation with us and my kids (ages 1,3, and 5) loved it! They especially loved the one about mummies as they love anything that they feel is even remotely related to Halloween. I also enjoyed these 2 episodes immensely and learned a lot myself! I also purchased the books portrayed in the episodes (also from Amazon) and we love the books also",1465257600,,487,4.362637362637362
