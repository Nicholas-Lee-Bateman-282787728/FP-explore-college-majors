Every ridiculously terrible christian cliche about the evil demons taking the world over is in this movie.  I can't believe someone actually sat down and wrote this crap and didn't intend for it to be a joke, because the only entertainment value in this movie is laughing at how horrible it is.  This movie makes plan 9 from outer space look like an academy award winner.  If you have an hour and a half of your life that you never want back then by all means watch this flaming pile of dog crap.  Otherwise avoid it like the plague or better yet if you see a copy of this dvd destroy it so no else will be subjected to this drector's preachy garbage.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!",1289692800,,882,4.214285714285714
8079928,2,B000AV2GFQ,"What a mishmash of a flick!  The acting is very mixed with the ""fathers"" being solid (both Mr. Lansing and the Top Priest), but they are thrown into the stew with probable newbies to the acting gig (except for Rocky's Cornerman, that being Tony Burton, who gave an uneven performance here)...and it shows, sadly, which takes away from the creepy dilemma in the plot.  Some effective surprises come in the form of special effects and occasionally the score, but it sounds far too much like a really bad ripoff of Brad Fiedel's music for ""Fright Night""...(do not dare thieve from that glorious work unless you have the goods!).  The scenes of spiritual battle between the priest and pastor vs. the evil spirits, respectively, are good, intense and powerful...just throw out the cheesy synth sound effects!!  Then, to top it off, somehow the ""Catholics"" couldn't muster up enough authority, so dah-dah...the Protestant arrives!  While the Catholic priest is demonically mocked for having too much pride, the writing comes off proud itself towards its view of the Protestant Church...hmmmmmm...another plot of the Dark Side?  Unfortunately, maybe so....but this is only a battle...the War continues.....",1287446400,2,1199,5.21875
8079929,1,B000AV2GFQ,"It looks like the fundies have done for B rated horror what they did to Rock and Roll. They added religion to it and messed it up. The acting in this movie is extremely bad, and down right funny when people are possessed with demons flopping around on the ground like a fish out of water. The camera angles are also bad. It seems ""Daddy"" has made a deal with the devil. Now the devil has come to collect as Satan always bothers Christian families. It is also ""the end times"" so Satan is attempting to get as many souls as possible. Any crazy person who kills is demonically possessed. Now there are priests in the movie, but they can't keep out demons because they all molest young children. The daughter, who had rejected the Catholic church, and has been attending a non-denominational exorcism class, invites the leader over to exercise the demon in Daddy. Demons look a lot like Klingons. There is also plenty of witnessing for Jesus  if the ""horror"" aspect bores you. This movie is designed for tweens of far right fundie families.  It is also campy enough for a group of godless people to enjoy while stoned!",1281312000,2,1114,4.537313432835821
8079930,5,B000AV2GFQ,"This movie is awesome!!!! My friend and I were at home one day surfing the channels and we came across this movie on the sci-fi channel.  We are both christians and have discernment over lots of things. We watched this movie and was in awe of how well the director potrayed the power demons and satan think they have over us!  This is a great witnessing tool for new members who are on fire for Christ or even those of us who has allowed our power to control or dwindle.  It shows that Jesus is still on the throne.  Now this movie is little or nothing.  I think it is  something every church that believes in the Trinity should have this for when they teach on demons because they are REAL.  This is a very good account of how the enemy comes in to rob, steal, kill and destroy!",1215561600,5,779,4.1879194630872485
