1664396,4,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina is probably one of the most talked series since Ken Akamatsu's manga started running. The story revolves around Keitaro Urashima, who, as a small child, made a promise to a girl to go together with her to Toudai (Tokyo University). Unfortunately, not only does he not remember what the girl looks like, but he is on the verge of failing the entrance exam for the university for the third straight year. His situation is further complicated when he ends up being the manager of his grandmother's Hinata Inn (which happens to be where he made the promise to the mysterious girl). Did I mention the Hinata Inn has since become an all-girls dormitory?
While many argue that the basis of the story is overdone (one central male figure surrounded by many female figures), Love Hina manages to have a charm of its own. The characters are quite varied and complex, and quite a bit of character development is done throughout (but probably much more so in the manga series). The series is also quite fun to watch - there are quite a few high-energy sequences, from chasing Keitaro around the Inn to battling hundreds of mechanized turtles. (Don't ask.)
The voice acting (Japanese) is top-notch as well - Yuji Ueda and Yui Horie play the lead characters (Keitaro and Naru) masterfully - from high-energy arguments to emotionally charged moments, it works perfectly. The other characters are also quite well suited - there's even Megumi Hayashibara playing one of the minor roles! (I'll let you try and find out which one she is.)
Although not one of my absolute favorites (that priviledge is reserved for the Japanese version of Cardcaptor Sakura), this series is definitely worth a look.",1007856000,20,1688,4.844290657439446
1664397,4,B00005UBKC,"First off, this is my first review of any anime.  This anime
is a romantic comedy targetted mainly toward single male guys
looking for a girl (similar to oh my goddess) but with significantly more character development.  On this first dvd,
you are introduced to the characters of Hinata Sou; each
of the characters have their various quirks.  And each of these
are revealed when Keitaro moves into this exclusively girl only
inn, after failing to get into Tokyo U.  A wide range of rather
compromising scenes, i.e: Narusegawa touches Keitaros ummm....
although they may have removed it from the us release, provide
the basis for the slapstick humor involved.  It gets even
more zany as well....
With its wide variety of slapstick humor, fairly complicated development, and rather well designed artwork (after reading about 95% of the manga and the series itself), I'm sure you'll find it an intresting and worth purchasing anime.",1007683200,5,929,5.0064935064935066
1664398,5,B00005UBKC,"""Love Hina"" is a brilliant anime series. At first glance, it seems formulaic. Narusagawa and Keitaro join the long line of shy college students who can't/won't express their feelings for each other. ""Maison Ikkoku"" and ""Oh! My Goddess"" come to mind. After a few episodes, the difference becomes clear, and ""Love Hina"" begins to shine.
This anime is FUNNY. It is funny on a level that other series do not approach. ""Love Hina"" takes place in a women's dorm, Hinata Lodge. The lodge is populated by a small group of beautiful girls, who are all misfits in their own way. Motoko is a mystical Kendo warrior. Suu is pretty much Radical Edward transplanted. Narusagawa is trying hard for Tokyo University, and studies so hard she needs bottle thick glasses. The male manager of the Hinata Lodge is Keitaro, a 3 time Ronin also trying for Tokyo University. Hijinks ensue. Underpants are accidentally displayed. First kisses ALMOST happen. Keitaro is slapped, kicked and sent into orbit. Classic Japanese anime slapstick.
The animation is A+++. (A great episode involving Motoko takes place in the flickering, black and white style of old Samurai films.) The characters all have distinct personalities and great character design. I love the opening theme music. I highly, highly highly recommend ""Love Hina.""",1006992000,7,1301,5.08411214953271

1664401,4,B00005UBKC,"I have seen the light and it is the first few episodes of ""Love Hina"". Ok, I'm kidding, but it really is a good show. Animation is cute and pretty darn good, as is the music. It is very funny, with the poor main guy character getting beat on a lot for no good reason (you'll have to watch to understand - its not stupid!). I only gave it four stars because, well...I don't really know; It's not perfect I guess, and if they try to dub the voices *shudder*. It doesn't show too much in the first few episodes, but it looks like it will probably take a more romantic bend later in the series. I think it is aimed more to guys, but don't let that discourage any girl anime fans.

Packed full of awkward and hilarious moments, Love Hina is a Romance/Comedy series well worth watching, also be sure to check out the Specials and Final piece Love Hina Again.

1664432,4,B00005UBKC,"How does a second-time prep school reject aspiring to enter Tokyo University become the manager of an all-girl's dorm?  Well, it helps if his grandmother decides to go off on a trip and outright asks him.  Two, as there's no manager lined up, the dorm would close, and the girls would have to leave.  However, due to a mixture of sheer clumsiness, misunderstandings, and being at the wrong place at the wrong time, the tenants there give Keitaro Urashima grief after grief.  On his first day, still thinking the dorm is an old hotel and NOT a dorm, he accidentally enters the girls' bath, runs off with a laundry basket with some women's undies still in them, and gets attacked by some large mechanical toys built by a precocious exchange student.  Welcome to Love Hina, based on the manga series by Ken Akamatsu (Negima!).

Keitaro's tenants think he is at the prestigious Tokyo U, and are impressed.  Their learning of the truth later doesn't get him into that much hot water than in the manga though.  The long-haired Naru Narusegawa, who also happens to be at the same prep school and is also trying to get into Todai, takes some sympathy on him.  The rest of the time, she is delivering him punches that literally sends him flying through the air to the other end of town.  The sheer ridiculousness of this is highlighted at one point, when she aims a punch at him from the balcony below, and he screams out ""how did that punch connect?"" as he's making another crosstown flight.

Mitsune Konno, a.k.a. Kitsune.  That latter is her nickname and means ""fox"" in Japanese.  She has a tough and husky Osakan accent, kind of like a gangster's moll.  Then there's dark-skinned Kaolla Su.  Although we're never given her country of origin, it must be India, as she has a red dot on her forehead, loves superspicy foods, and in one of the mangas, we find out one of her coins has an elephant on it.  The energetic, karate-kicking, mechanical toy inventor of the bunch, she has a bratty voice and just wants someone to play with her.

Two of the episodes help to introduce characters into the action.  2-year old Shinobu Maehara is cute and shy, and initially depressed.  Her parents have divorced and she is the pawn in a custody battle.  She meets the rest of the gang when she stops off to return Keitaro's sketchbook, and the rest is history.  Yet in the manga, she is already a tenant when Keitaro arrives, so a variation there.

The other is Motoko Aoyama.  Dressed in an outfit similar to Kikyo in Inuyasha, she is by far the most ferocious of the tenants coming from a long generation of sword fighters, her fantastic skills earning her a kendo mastership at the age of 15.  So deadly is her swordplay, that she can create a vortex of wind with a swish of her blade.  She gets mad over wrongly created conclusions, which isn't good for Keitaro, and at one time, challenges him for the managership.

As books become movies, manga gets turned into animes, and there are variations.  One is that Naru's character is more sympathetic to Keitaro than the manga, where she is downright vicious.  Another is the appearance of the three town elders, three men dressed in monk's robes who pop up to voice commentary relevant to the situation or person onhand.

What may also be interesting is that Megumi Hayashibara, who sings the insanely cheery and rapid-fire opening theme song, voices the laid back Aunt Haruka. Hayashibara also did the theme song and voiced the title character of a certain All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl.  On another voice, Azumanga Daioh fans may recognize the voice of Yu Asakawa, who did the voice of the tall, long-haired, and shy cat-lover Sakaki.  Here, she does Motoko.

Good start to the series.",1106438400,3,3720,4.6493108728943335
1664433,5,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina a piece of animation genious with likeable characters and a good plot to keep you watching.

When i bought the first Love Hina dvd i watched it over and over until the second one came.  I kid you not, i watched that thing at least a hundred times.

The series starts out by introducing all of the characters and MOST of the delimas.  Keitaro Urashima is somewhat of a downer, and you have to wonder how the girls put up with him dispite the constant run ins with them in their towels, this is, if he doesn't have his head in Naru's chest.  He is an extremely un-lucky guy!

The first dvd gets right into things and you will immediately find yourself rooting for Keitaro to find that little girl.  The quality of the animation is top notch for a digital anime.  Nothing is comprimesed right down to the very addicting soundtrack!

I would rate this dvd appropriate only for kids over thirteen and NO, that doesn't include thirteen year olds.  There are numerous rather tame incounters with girls in their towels, and constant run ins (literally) with Keitaro and Naru.  I don't think i would call all the punching and kicking violence because there is never anything at even looks realistic in terms of fighting.  Its mostly the girls beating on Keitaro i mean he did just become manager of an all girls dorm!  There are on or two swear words to look out for as well.

Dont get me wrong i LOVE this series, and especially this installment, im just trying to play devils advocate for the parents out there.  Remember christmas is coming!",1101427200,2,1545,4.5071942446043165

How will the girls react to a man living in their all-girls building? He's already gotten off on the wrong foot. But as they get to know him...he still finds himself at the short end of the stick (and sometimes the katana).

1664435,4,B00005UBKC,"This was the first ""romance"" anime that I got into.  It's funny enough without being overly silly, although it does get sort of silly with the whole Turtle Civilization subplot.  I think the manga has a better balance of relationship building vs. silliness.

Do yourself a favor and watch in Japanese with subtitles.  Don't get me wrong - most English dubs in the past few years have been quite excellent.  This one was not one of those.  There are too many poorly done voices (Kaolla Su and Kitsune)",1098057600,,500,4.625

1664438,4,B00005UBKC,"Funny Comedy/Romantic harem style anime
Love Hina is a romantic/comedic harem style anime based on the shonen manga by Akamatsu Ken. Love Hina (Japanese Version Rabu-Hina) revolves around the main character Keitarou Urashima.  Keitarou, a 20 year old, is trying to pass the entrance exams to got to Tokyo University (or Toudai in Japanese - Toudai is the Japanese equivalent of MIT) even though he has already failed three times.
Keitarou desires to go to Toudai because he made a girl a promise (when he was 4) that when they grew up they would go to Toudai and be together for ever.  The little girl moves away and he can no longer remember anything about her, but he still tries to keep his promise to the girl to go to Toudai.
While studying for the entrance exams (again) Keitarou's grandmother, who owns the Hinata Inn - an all girls dormitory, decides to retire and ask Keitarou to take over as the manager.  Keitarou readily agrees since he needs a place to stay and not knowing that it is an all girls dormitory.  The girls of the dormitory initially reject a man coming to leave in the Hinata Inn but after mistaking thinking that he is already a Toudai student - which implies honor, responsibility, etc. - agree to reluctantly let him stay.
What follow after they find out he is only a want-to-be Toudai student is a hilarious comedy so Keitarou looks for the promised girl.  As the anime continues and the supporting characters are developed, Keitarou has to overcome and survive flying turtles, renegade robots, entrance exams, broken hearts, crying girls, an angry samurai, a martial arts professor,  and of course, the girls themselves.

Oh, and the artwork is just fantastic, recent anime really looks nice.

Young Keitaro dreams of attending Tokyo U, all because of a promise he made to a girl from his past.  When the time comes to take the entrance exams, Keitaro fails, and finds himself instead taking over duties as manager of the Hinata Apartments, which in actuality is a girls' dormitory owned by his grandmother.  Obviously, this clumsy, inexperienced young man will face a lot of problems.
The series starts off great with this first volume.  The characters are excellent.  Naru, an attractive girl and the object of Keitaro's affection.  Shinobu, the shy junior high girl.  Motoko, the kendo champion.  Su, the crazy young girl with a love of food and Toma the turtle.  Mitsune, the ""southern bell"" type character.  These are few of many involved in the series.

I found the DVD funny.  The first episodes deal with the characters, slowly bringing them into the story.  The extras were nice and the opening and ending music was cool.

1664454,5,B00005UBKC,"I must say that I first learned of Love Hina while at a bookstore.  I read the first manga and instantly fell in love with the series and managed to read the entire manga online.  When I learned that there was an anime of Love Hina I rushed to the local movie retailers to get one.  As a college aged guy, I'm mostly into stuff like Gundam, Macross, and other more action oriented anime.  The Tenchi animes where the only romantic comedies that I loved, but after watching this, I must say that Love Hina has become one of the animes closest to my heart.  I could relate to Keitaro as a character.  He's a guy who is actually a nice guy deep down who's trying to do the right thing besides fighting his human urges and imperfections.  The whole cast is just loveable and the anime is very entertaining.  My only complaints about this anime are the fact that there are a few cheesy parts and that Keitaro doesn't get beat up at much as as he did in the mangas.  Keitaro got beat up so many times more in the manga compared to the anime.  Despite these imperfections, Love Hina is something that I recommend that anime fans try.  It's not for everyone, but the series grew on me.  I also suggest checking out the manga if you happen across them.  Love Hina is a great romantic comedy and a great anime series.  I'm working on finishing my collection of this set and I've heard that the concluding episodes are part of a series called Love Hina Again.

The promise was to get there together when they grow up. The problem is that he doesn't remember her name or what she looks like because it's been a long time. Later he ends up living in an all girls dorm surrounded by girls while trying to get into Tokyo U.  Love Hina is funny cause there's always wacky scenes going on like Keitaro getting beat up by the girls all the time.  It's not just wacky, cause the story and the characters get emotional sometimes.  There's always trouble, crazy situations, adventures, and a lot of new characters are introduced throughout the series.  All the characters personalities are solid and the storyline is interesting.  If you're looking for some fun anime, you should check this out.",1052870400,,941,4.565476190476191
1664458,5,B00005UBKC,"People love this title like mad, and I'm no exception. I recommend that you read the manga (graphic novels) first, because the story is better developed in the original format.
The DVD version is a little watered down. For example, in the scene where Naru and Keitaro have an illicit beer after an unhappy event, the anime replaces the beer with tea. In some places the story is so compressed that it loses depth. But after you read the manga, you will come back for the anime because you'll be hungry for more.
Here's some more data: Love Hina is immensely popular in Japan too. So much that the anime voice actors went on tour and did a live act where they sang and danced (look for ""Love Live Hina"" and/or ""Final Selection"" on Google). The show was cheesey, but they still filled huge auditoriums with crazy fans who ate it up. Heck, I ate it up and I only saw the dvd (no subtitles!).
Watch out, you could become otaku for this series!",1048377600,,939,4.402298850574713
1664459,5,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina is a hilarious DVD (much better then the books in my opinion) the english dubbed is a little strange it makes some of the characters sound dorky, and I don't really like the front cover, but disregarding those two things this is a hilaroius, fast paced show.  It is about a boy(keitaro) who by lying becomes the manager of an all girls apartment!  Keitaro has been trying to get into Tokyo-U but he has failed his entrance exams three times.  He is also looking for this girl he made a promise to 15 years ago.  The characters are all great (expissaslly su) but the beginning of the first one is a little but strange.  The drawings are wonderful and creative and I like all those guys who walk through the village.  But if you're into big action/andeventure and fighting stuff this anime isn't for you.  But if you like cute funny strange romances like marmalade boy or Kodocha you will love Love Hina (sorry that sounded kinda strange)  So anyways a vey good Anime, worth the money.",1045353600,,993,4.5083798882681565

Well don't you worry, because this will along with tons of laughs! ^_~
You should get this dvd with the series box because after watching these first 4 episodes you'll want the entire collection.  There is a total of 26 tv episodes, along with specials (Christmas, spring break, etc).",1042588800,2,607,4.522935779816514
1664461,4,B00005UBKC,"This is the first of six DVD's of the Love Hina series and it comes with a box to store everything in.  The series is one of the best ""harem"" genre anime in existance.  Harem anime stars a loser guy who finds himself surrounded by hot babes.  Usually several (if not all) of the girls have the hots for him.
This DVD contains the first four episodes of the series and establish nicely the central characters and background for the overall romance story arc.  The stories are well writen, the characters are well developed (by the time the series ends), and there is plenty of great humor.
The reason I did not rate this as 5-stars was the DVD itself.  Sadly, the English dubbing is not that great.  It is ""OK"" but having Kitsune voiced as a southerner with an over-the-top accent really made me cringe!  Su's voice actor didn't do much better.  There are very few extra's on the DVD, so why not add a fifth episode?
Bottom line: ""Love Hina"" is a great series and well-worth having in you collection!  Good humor, fun stories, and a sweet romance overall arc make this one of anime's finest.",1042156800,,1090,4.4646464646464645
1664462,5,B00005UBKC,"To be honest, there are few animes that I watch more than once. Love Hina, I have watched over three times. I ended up getting the entire TV season plus the special in under a week. My bank account cries. Let's get down to business though.
The music of the series is great. It is supports the plot and action of the moment perfectly. Surprisingly as well it sounds that a great deal of the music is orchestrated, which surprises me.
The animation is also wonderful. The artists really bring out the mood of the characters by displaying them in different ways. If someone is sad they use one style to compliment that emotion. Overall they did perfectly.
The plot... I feel I cannot say enough about it. It builds you up to a climax, and drops you off, and repeats. Sometimes it will do this several times in a single episode. The plot itself is entrapping and locked me inside till I was unknowingly purchasing the entire series. The plot is the strongest facet of this anime.
The dubbing is good, but not perfect. There are several occasions that I noticed a lack of emotion, or perhaps a bit too much. It's not noticable, but if you listen, you can see the flaws that I have.
Overall, I'd say this...If you are looking for a powerful, moving plotline with characters that are odd yet relate to many of our characteristics and feels...well you must see this. If you are looking for a traditional love story with a knightly character and a damsel in distress, I would suggest not watching this. This series is the ""untraditional love story"" at its best. Don't take my word for it though, go out there are start watching it. Be warned that it is hard not to finish the series and is even harder to go without. I think I need to go to rehab.

Love Hina has since become my favorite anime series of all time. Part of it is that I am partial to this type of series (one guy with many pretty girls) but Love Hina goes a step further. The girls' characters eventually develop quite a bit and you learn some of the reasons they act the way they do. Also, there is lots of humor, including Kaolla at the controls of a fleet of (fully functional) miniature tanks in the first episode.
This series starts off good, and it will only get better as the series proceeds. Every otaku should watch at least the first volume. If you don't, you'll miss out on the goodness that is Love Hina!",1041552000,2,757,4.263888888888889

The classic dork (he proves hes not a nerd) ends up working at a girls dormitory.  This has to be my favorite anime series ever.  The characters are all predictable and that's what makes this series so great.  There is some strange pleasure in seeing the main character fly through the air after being punched from 100 yards away.  Anime is great because it shows the feelings of the characters in ways you normaly would get to see.  I am Funnoodlehead and I am a hopeless romantic.  Hey its in the Bible!

It was really wonderful, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm getting all the other volumes, plus the Christmas Movie for Christmas. I reccomend Love Hina to anyone who likes a good laugh. This DVD cotains the 1st 4 episodes of Love Hina, and might I say, the english voice actors do a very nice job, and the music is very pretty. I am so addicted to the song I must hear it all the time!  I think Su, Shinobu, and Naru are very cute, and are drawn nicely. Both their English and Japanese voices are done very good.
Episode 1-20-year-old Keitaro Urashima is trying to get into Tokyo University for the 3rd time, since he made a promise to a girl 15 years ago. Only, he can't remember who the girl is. His grandmother Hina Urashima is leaving the Hinata Apartments, and has chosen Keitaro to be the new manager. When he arrives, he hops into the hotsprings bath. He is surprised when he finds out that he went into the women's bath, and that it was an all-girl dormitory. The girls cannot accept them as the new manager.
Episode 2-7th grader Shinobu Maehara's always getting picked on at school, and her parents are going to get divorced, which will mean Shinobu will have to move away. But she doesn't want to. Earlier in episode 1, Keitaro was drawing her, when he dropped his sketchbook, and Shinobu tries to return it to him. She becomes acquainted with everyone, and they invite her to a good-bye party. Unfortunatley, she ends up doing all the work. When her parents come looking for her, they find out she wants to stay at the Hinata Apartments, so she does.
Episode 3-Motoko Aoyama returns from her long retreat, and mistakes Keitaro as a stalker. She challenges him to a dual, but she comes down with a cold.
Episode 4-Keitaro and Naru go to take their exams into Tokyo U, but after Keitaro takes it, he has to grade it himself. He knows he won't make it. When he found out he got the first 3 questions wrong,he stopped. But later, he finds out that he did fail. Who knows? Maybe he will make it in later in the series?",1040342400,8,2174,4.367901234567901

1664467,5,B00005UBKC,"The entire Love Hina series is a hilarious addition to anyone's anime collection.  It is brilliantly written and drawn out, with hilarious running gags and funny circumstances/situations.  The characters, each with his or her wonderfully expressed personalities really adds to this series.  It's hilarious that they stuck a modest and shy wannabe Todai student (Keitaro Urashima) into an all-girls dormitory, and had him get accustomed to living with only girls.  You'd be glued to your seat for hours, watching episode after episode of Keitaro getting in over his head with the girls, especially Naru Narusegawa (also trying to get into Todai university).  This is my favorite anime series so far, and the manga is great as well.",1033948800,4,730,5.205128205128205
1664468,5,B00005UBKC,"I have only read the bilingual Japanese editions of Love Hina so my comparisons will be dealing with that translation of the manga. I've only read through chapter 16 (Volume 3).
Keitaro is a 20 year-old guy struggling to get into college. He keeps failing entrance exams. He collects photo booth pictures of himself alone since he has never had a girl-friend. The only girl to ever like him was someone he hasn't seen since he was about 5 years old. Back then, they made a promise to go to Tokyo Univerisity together. It's believed that any couple that goes to Tokyo U. together will live happily ever after. Even though Keitaro can't even remember her name, he's still trying to get into the university in the hopes of seeing the girl from his past again.
The animation for this series was done on computers. (There's a featurette in a later volume.) Some people may not care for that - preferring true cel animation. I don't mind it.
The DVD has four episodes.
""All-girls Dorm with Outdoor Bath: Hot Spring"" has Keitaro moving into the dorm.
""The Hinata's New Resident, Shinobu: Arrow Signs"": Shinobu's parents are getting a divorce and forcing her to move away with her mom. She doesn't want to leave.
""Kendo Girl in Love?: Swordplay"": Motoko thinks she might be in love with Keitaro.
""The Tokyo U Promise From 15 Years Ago: Diary"": Keitaro falls against a shelf in Naru's room causing her diary to fall and open to a page mentioning a promise from 15 years ago. That's all he could read before Naru shows up. Keitaro begins to wonder if Naru is the girl from his past.
With no pun intended, the anime series is a very cartoonish version of the manga. The manga may have insane moments, but it remains somewhat realistic. Naru may sometimes send Keitaro flying across the room but not a few miles through the sky like in the opening titles of the anime. Based on what I've read so far, Su doesn't have all of the neat toys in the manga. However, she is energetic and may knock Keitaro around a bit. In the anime, there are insane chase scenes through the hallways of the apartments (sometimes with explosions) that do not exist in the original manga.
As with most anime adaptations, there are some basic plots that appear in both versions, but the presentation is rarely the same. There are differences in the stories that are presented in both formats. I don't mind that. Later in the series, I think things get a little too insane but still not too bad. The truly insane bits don't show up in the parts of the manga I have read. True fans may want to stick with the complete anime series anyway. I still plan to see it to the end, including the movie.",1033689600,5,2656,4.512448132780083

At 20 years old, Keitaro Urashima becomes the manager of the Hinata Inn, an all girls dorm that is owned by his grandmother.  Put together a mix of craziness with Keitaro being beat up by some of the residents and a wonderful romance story, and you have Love Hina.  Spanning 24 episodes, an extra episode 25, X-mas and Spring special  episodes, a ""Final Selection"" concert, and a 3 episode OVA follow up called Love Hina Again, this is one of the best romance/comedy series out there.  If romance is your thing, I highly recommend Love Hina. This is a nice long series that you will fall in love with it very quickly and ask for more.",1033257600,2,915,4.378698224852071

Sure, the panty shots of Naru and the other girls gets repetetive, but they're usually followed by some gret humor or punchline. Kitsune does have a Southern accent in the English dub, but the translators took Kitsune's character, which is apparently from Southern Japan, and tried to keep it close to the original dialect, hence the Southern. I prefer the Japanese, which features the always amazing Megume Hayashibara in a smaller role for once, unusual for her. Overall, this is a great show and will make you laugh with the jokes and animation style, which is very clean and great-looking.",1029974400,2,647,4.837837837837838

I like Kitsune and Naru who are really great in the formation of the story. Keitaro is a great guy and funny, but the thing is how can he survive all those beatings from the girls in the dorm? He must heal fast to be back on his feet the next day. I wish I was a landlord of a girl's dorm. I wonder what it would be like? If the girls are like the ones in Love Hina then I'm in. One-of-a-kind people there are in the story. It's also motivational too. It teaches that you should never give up no matter what happens. ""Overcome all obstacles"" that's what I learned. It really made me think about myself and my life. Okay! Enough about me. Otherwise, this is a great DVD and you should get the whole series. I know I will! Buy it or regret it!",1027987200,2,908,4.05
1664487,5,B00005UBKC,"Keitaro and his childhood sweetheart make a promise to be accepted at and to meet each other at the prestigous Toudai University before she moved out of his life. About a decade later, Keitaro has become an artist and a daydreamer, having ranked 27th from the last in the national practice exam. When his grandmother leaves the all-girls dormitory, he becomes the residential manager and soon meets up with two Todai applicants who may have been that sweetheart, since he's forgotten her name. Then there the other tenants like young Shinobu who was in despair until Keitaro helped her, Motoko the swordsmaster who sees men as evil distractions, Su Kaolo the genius child inventor and the sneaky Kitsune.
Animation is good, and very fluid.  Strangely, this anime was done using computers instead of the traditional cels.
Good story and very humorous that never gets slapstic-stupid.  There's some excellent Kenshin-like swordsmanship seen in Motoko.  There's some crazy trips around Japan, some tropical islands, and around the world.  There's ancient tribes and ruins.  There's a good amount of fan service included as a bonus.  All this adds up to a funny love story in Hina-sou.
There's also great music.  If you liked the part where (later in the series--no spoilers here) Naru finds Keitaro in the snow at Todai, the song that plays is ""Yakusoku"" and is pretty good.  The wildly popular hit song from the Christmas OVA, ""Winter Wish"" is also excellent.  Both of these comes on single CD's, if you can find them.  ""Friendship"", from the ""Hinata Girls Song Best vol 2, is pretty sweet, but only available on a...cd!",1027382400,2,1618,4.95925925925926
1664488,5,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina is just an adorable anime. If you want an anime series with romance combined with a little comedy then this is it. Keitaro Urashima is a boy who has been trying to get into Tokyo University fro three years. Why? Well, because of a promise he made to a little girl that he liked when he was five (I think it was five) years old. Keitaro is....well a loser. He's never had a girlfriend, and doesn't have a lot of friends, and doesn't have the scores to make it in Tokyo University however he's very nice and has a kind heart.
When Keitaro's parents kicks him out of the house because he wouldn't give up on his dreams to go to Tokyo University he goes to his grandmother's house (or rather hotel). Keitaro's reaches the house but no one is there so he invites himself in. Later that night he decides to go swimming/bathing in the outside hot springs. That's when all his troubles begins. It turns out that the house was actually an all girl's hotel/house and Keitaro's grandma made him the new manager. Let's say that the girl's weren't that happy with the new revelation. That's how the story begins...
Episodes 1: This episode is the set up of the story. The promise, Keitaro's parents throws him out of their house, Keitaro goes to grandmother's house, goes bathing, gets punched, kicked, yelled at, and lastly he's made the new manager.
Episode 2: This is about Shinobu who is a cute short haired girl who will later join the other ""happy"" residents of Hinata Apartments.
Episode 3: The hot headed Motoko ""Kendo Girl"" comes back to the apartment after her little trip. Who does she find? Keitaro, the new boy manager. After Motoko runs around trying to beat him up she realizes that she's blushing around him. What is this about? Does she like him?
Episode 4: Episode 4 goes over the promise that Keitaro made with the girl when he was younger. He then begins to notice things about one of his roomates, Naru. Is she the girl he made the promise to when he was a child?
Love Hina is one of the best romance anime out there. It's cute, funny, and there is action (mostly Keitaro getting beat up). The characters are just too funny when they're together. They're just wacky and you can't get enough of them. Also the graphics are beautiful. Since the manga was first published in 1999 then the anime should have been made around the same time period so the anime is pretty high quality. Also the theme and ending songs are great. ""Sakura Saku"" by Megumi Hayashibara is the theme song. If Megumi Hayashibara is the singer then you know that the song is a hit.

 Keitaro is a 19 year old boy who has been trying to get in to Tokyo University for the past 2 years. He is determined to get into this very tough university because when he was 4 years old he promised a girl that when they were older they would both get in to Tokyo U and live happily ever after...
 Unfortunently It didn't turn out that way.
 Keitaro has barely ever talked to a girl in his life, he's never done any ""cool"" team sports he's not good at schoolwork, he is extremelly clumsy, and to top it off he's forgot his childhood sweetheart's name!
 Because of  failing the tests all the time his parents decided to not fund him anymore, so he had to go on his own.
Then remembered that his grandmother owned a hotel (where he met his childhood girlfriend) so he went to her place to see if he could stay for a while.
 To make a long story short (long story includes: missunderstandings, a chase scene, accidental flashing, accidental groupeing, and swords) he finds out that his grandmothers hotel turned into a girls dorm, and his grandmother is on a world tour so there's nothing she can do about him (or is there).
 When all the girls were kicking him out something unexpected happens.
 Keitaro's grandmother gives him the deeds to the girls dorm.

That is until he finds out that living with these hotties will probably land him in traction for the rest of his youth.  If only I could be him, how much more of a man... uh, never mind.
Love Hina takes the viewer on a predictable, comedy driven ride through the lives of young anime characters.  Like the cover suggests, the boy represses his manly side to please the egoes of his feminine housemates.  He's punched, pulled, thrown, kicked, screamed at, sword attacked, and ridiculed.  Through it all, he apologizes profusely, and dorks it up good.
The animation, soundtrack, and pace make this anime a little amateurish and rough, but that veneer wears off pretty quickly.  Underneath the forementioned cons, lie some pretty good pros.  The struggle to find success in school, the embarasment of enfatuative discovery, and the drive to keep promises make this show a lot more than it seems.  First impressions don't always pan out I guess.

However, it's clear within three episodes, that this series is a different execution.  The characters, while attracted to the central male, don't let it suddenly dominate their actions.  It's the kind of pupply love/light hearted connections that make them more spontaneous and they're still the same unpredictable people.
On top of that, the lead male doesn't just let things happen.  He tries his best to win the girl of his dreams, and his goals at the same time.

Before you all get your guns, my last request is to speak briefly why I think this way.
First off I do not find women slapping men funny.  Conversley I do not find men slapping women funny.  There is much man slapping to be found here.  He doesn't really deserve it, but I don't sympathize with him either way.  I just wanted to slap myself for not renting this before I bought it.
As a fan of Anime I am constantly looking for that series like Urusei Yatsura that parodies Japanese culture, uses puns and basically challenges my Japanese knowledge of vocabulary and culture.
In a sick way this show did accomplished just that.  It is a cookie cutter anime in the way that it is lacking in a story while it has superb character design and realistic backdrops.
It has great art and enormous potential, but it fizz-bombed in my book.
It lacks any continuity to the original Manga.  The story is disjointed and plot ""surprises"" such as the core nostalgic love interest should have been a hidden surprise (a qualm I had with the manga too).  Instead this show gives away all of its secrets in the first episode or two.
As a recovering Ranma-holic.  I am tired of catchy phrases like, ""You are so uncute."" Then Akane smacks Ranma.  This series has that and less.  Keitaro gets the, ""Hentai!"" put-down and a slam Akane never could match.  What ever happened to red face slapping ala Kyoko in Maison Ikkoku?
Speaking of Maison Ikkoku, couldn't the writer have thought of a better plot than ""Keitaro-loser-kun trying to get into college?""  Didn't Godai have a similar problem?  It always seems to be Tokyo University too.  Most Japanese people know by junior high that they aren't going to To-dai.  Why the contrived plot?
Other perpetraitors of Maison I(clone)yu disease are Sakura Diaries, Seiki no Hamau,  Fushigi Yugi (highschool instead of college) and even one instance even pariodied briefly on Otaku No Video.
Read the first book of the manga at your local Borders or Barnes and Nobel first.  If you like it, buy it and hate me.  If it looks cliche, that is because it is.
For me this Anime is right on level with Ruroni Kenshin, Kite, Dominion Tank Police and Green legend Ran.  Simple copies of better more original Anime.
Tenchi copy?  close enough. We need better Anime in the STATES!!

I don't think tenchi was shot at before. Anyways, like my other reviews, everyone else wrote about the stroyline, so i need not to write about it again. The story behind this is..well, a love story.

However, the official dub is utterly horrible. Shinobu, Kaolla and Mistune sound like they are adult women with southern accents. Shinobu and Kaolla are under 14. And Mistune is 18. While on the topic of US voice actors, none of the voices fit the characters at all. Also, the translation is pretty bad. It's been dummied down, for censorship and aimed at a younger US audience. The sub title wasn't too bad. It's a lot closer to the original storyline then the dub. If you truly wish to enjoy Love Hina, you need to turn off English dub, listen to it in Japanese and watch the sub title.

1664501,2,B00005UBKC,"When I first started watching Love Hina, I found it to be very amusing and well-animated.. however, after sitting through the entire series, I found my attitude towards it had changed dramatically. If you're looking for a ""loser guy is surrounded by tons of beautiful women who beat the stuffing out of him on a daily basis but secretly think he's a good guy"" series, then you have found the perfect match.
Poor Keitaro is an everyman, a somewhat loveable loser who finds himself in the situation of his dreams - living with gorgeous girls - only to have the worst luck around them, ending up in situations that make him look like a huge pervert. Keitaro falls in love with one girl, Naru Narusegawa, who loves nothing more than to kick him into orbit every five minutes. The entire point of the series is to see if Keitaro can get Naru to return his affections.
I admit that I did enjoy some of the series, notably the one where Keitaro dreams the girls into a video game, and one or two of the ""Motoko the Kendo-Girl isn't so mean as she seems"" shows. However, the number of mindless filler episodes far outnumbers the good ones, and even when the show attempts to convey that Keitaro is Feeling Deep Emotions and You Should Sympathize With Him, I mostly found myself yawning and wishing the show would develop some substance (or at least some unrelated to the chest size of the Hinata Sou girls).
If you like eye candy in the form of teenage girls, or think the same stunt repeated ad infinitem (namely one or all of the girls attacking Keitaro every ten seconds) is amusing, you'll probably enjoy this series. If you like anime with substance and plot, you might want to pass this over. Consider this the ""Dragonball Z"" of shounen romance stories - juvenile, repetative, and not that interesting.",1019088000,8,1800,4.593167701863354

Every episode has the residents of the Hinata-sou involved in some wacky adventure, and yet the show manages to remain somewhat anchored in reality.  The only really unsatisfactory character is Suu-chan.  The technically adept bare-footed young girl character is a really worn and tired concept(She reminds me of Ed from Bebop, only with better speech).  The artwork and animation are not be missed by any fan of anime!  Whether you like the story or not, Rabu Hina has some of the best artwork and animation I have ever seen animated, period.  It was totally made digitally, and yet does not support a computer generated work, which means that the animation is not only fluid, but very lifelike while mainting the overall cartoonish feel.  The only part that isn't good is the dub, especially Kitsune-chan's dub.  Why they gave her a southern accent is beyond me, but since the Japanese voices are absolutely astounding anyhow, I would recommend that you go subtitled anyway(or better yet, learn nihon go (Japanese)) and watch it with no subtitles!)

1664503,5,B00005UBKC,"Like many anime TV sereies, Love Hina has it's roots in comics. The TV sreies consisted of 27 episodes, including a Christmas Special.
It's a romantic, comedy with a straight forward storyline. A 20 year old, Tokyo U student wanna-be (Keitrao) ends up as the manager of an all girls dorm in a small town, Hinata. The reaction of the girls isn't exactly good, and the tension between the residents and Keitaro makes for funny situations. Add in the fact that Keitaro has been without a ""girl"" friend since he was 5, and you find a bumbling naive boy being overrun by the girls. (In some ways, it's remeniscent of the Tenchi Muyo! storylines.)
The main female character is Naru, also trying to get into Tokyo U, and it seems her main task is to beat Keitaro to a pulp by the end of the series and be his main love interest. The other main characters are: Kitsune, a girl focused on parties and money; Motoko, a sword master; Su, a techologically inclined exchange student; and Shinobu, shy but a good cook (also the most popular character in Japan).
The animation is excellent, clear even when viewed frame by frame. The problem arises in the English dub. First, the sound is noticeably softer than the Japanese track. Second, the characters voices aren't what you'd expect. No matter how hard I try, there's no way Kitsune would have a southern accent. Third, on some DVD players, the subtitles come up and disappear late.
My opinion, if you are looking for a laugh, this sereies will likely be a good buy. If you liked Tenchi, you'll like this series.",1018915200,8,1551,4.602888086642599
1664514,5,B00005UBKC,"Here's my review:
Video
Excellent, excellent quality. I have seen both the VCD and DVD versions fo this anime, and I must say even though the quality for the VCD is great, the quality on the DVD is much better. (Of course. ;) I have nothing against VCD's, I love them too.) Both are fine, but if you want to experience the maximum quality, get this DVD version. It's worth it. Also, since Love Hina was digitally drawn, it really shows off its vibrant colours on the DVD. I give it 5/5 for video quality.
Audio
The audio is great. The dub is not as bad as people say, though there are lots of room for improvements. The good thing is that they also included the Japanese soundtrack with or without subtitles on this DVD, so won't have to worry about bad dubbing. I give it 5/5 for audio quality.
Packaging
Even though its English logo is too 70's, the logo remained unchanged on the actual opening of the video. I am actually starting to like the English logo too. Also, the collector's box and DVD box are also very carefully designed. The colours are vibrant and the characters don't look ""cut-n-pasted"". I also recommend getting the DVD with the collector's box if you have the chance since it's well worth the money. I give it 5/5 for packaging.
Menu
The menu is easy to navigate, and each of the four episodes are divided up into four parts for easy tracking or searching. I also give it 5/5 for menu design.
Subtitles
Bandai's subtitles aren't bad, they could be a little bit hard to read at first, but they are not hard to read once you get used to it. (I got used to it in FIVE minutes.) Also, all the endings on people's names like sempai and san were replaced with Mr. and Ms.. It's not that bad. I give it 4/5 for subtitles.
Extra's
There are too much extra on this DVD, though there are trailers, Keitaro's sketchbook, and character information in the ""Extra"" section. It's not that bad. I give it 4/5 for extra's.
Content
The story is based on a guy who is trying to get accepted into Tokyo University. He travels to his grandmother's Inn, and finds himself in an all-girl dormity. I will stop here now as it will spoil the story for you. ;) It's really funny, and it's wildly popular. Get it now! I give it 6/5 (yes one extra point) for its content.

Overall, I give this product 5/5. Buy it now, it's well worht the money. :)

The series contains enough comedy violence to keep you going for years - I've had the DVD for 3 days and already seen it twice! :) This series is great - It's a refreshing change from the seriousness of Evangelion, and the other big series.
If you do buy this series, i really reccomend that you watch it SUBBED and not DUBBED, as most of the character dubs are terrible, and the dubbed script misses out many of the small jokes that makes the series even more funny.

love hina is one of the best romantic comedy animes out there. the whole series is fun to watch (except for a couple boring filler episodes) and is almost guaranteed to make you laugh the first time round. why I'm saying first time is because the jokes and the whole ""keitarou (the main character) being punched into space"" thing starts to get repetitive, and even annoying because most of the time hes getting punched/kicked/beat down for absolutely no reason at all. despite this, it still has a high entertainment factor and thats why I'm giving it 5 stars instead of just 4. THE DUBBING IS TERRIBLE THOUGH, DO NOT WATCH THE DUBBING. In my opinion it is one of the worst choices of american accents/voices I have ever heard.",1015718400,,975,4.580459770114943

This is the first disc of the hit series on Japan (24 episodes, plus 2 OVAs), based on the homonynous manga by Ken Akamatsu. Keitaro is your average romantic shonen character: clueless, failed on school and hard luck with woman.
The first four episodes deals with the introduction of the character that live at Hinata Lodge, and mostly the situation faced by Keitaro as a second year drifeter from Tokyo-U and the way Hinata Lodge changes after his arrival (something most apparent on the manga than on the anime, I should note).
The box is nice, be sure to get this one for a great display on your shelf. Many complained the US logo, but theoriginal logo is where it allways belonged, at the opening of every single episode.

The episodes are very good but my favourite would be episode four cause it's very funny. The characters do grow and change during this series unlike some other anime shows.

The story goes like this: Keitaro Urashima becomes the manager of Hinata Apartments when his grandmother resigns. What he doesn't know is that it's an all-girls dorm! Unfortunately for him, through a series of incredibly bad luck, he manages to convince most (if not all) of the girls that he's a pervert and a liar. Of course, he's not really either of these (deliberately, anyway), but with his aunt backing up the lie that he's a Tokyo U student and his amazing bad luck, it's difficult to dispell these notions. He often finds himself being threatened by a couple of very violent girls, he still can't manage to pass the preliminary exams at his cram school, and he still can't remember the name of the girl he made the promise to 15 years ago to get into Tokyo U.

1664533,5,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina is another entrant in the anime category of wimpy guy surrounded by girls.  Fortunately, it's a very good entrant.  The wimpy guy here is Keitaro, who has tried and failed to enter Tokyo University the past two years.  His parents are sick of supporting him, and his grandmother and aunt rope him into managing an apartment of girls.  Hijinks ensue, typically involving accidentally finding the girls in compromising situations or inadvertant touching.  Keitaro suffers regularly at the hands of the girls, but it's so over the top and silly that it works.  Also, Keitaro is not the total loser: he's loyal, kind-hearted, and a talented artist, and struggles for his dream of Tokyo U.
The production quality here is extremely high: the animation is nice, the colors are clear.  The only problem is that the English dub is recorded at a very low level; in particular, the opening theme is almost inaudible on the first episode, but does pick up on later episodes.  The dialogue and such is always audible, just quiet.  The English casting is not perfect, but only in the sense I just don't think the voice actress for Naru (the female lead) fits (she does a good job, but sounds wrong).  Another of the girls has a pseudo-Southern accent, which sounds as fake as it is, but it never becomes grating.
I purchased disc 1 with the series box, which will hold all the forthcoming DVDs.  It's a solid, if not spectacular box: hard cardboard with some nice images of the cast.  It's an open-sided box, where the DVDs just slide in and their spines show.  Definately worth the extra couple of bucks if it's still available when you buy.",1014163200,2,1638,4.705263157894737

1664536,5,B00005UBKC,"Upon first glance at Love Hina, you'll be amazed at the visual slendor of this series. Hina has beautiful, OVA-quality animation, on TV. You won't see TV animation quality this good except maybe in Cowboy Bebop and Escaflowne.
After an episode or two, you'll be hooked.  Just about every characters, including side-characters, are very likable, right down to the old gramps that make philosophical mumblings.  The show borrows many successful character formulas from other animes, but adds enough originality to make them stand-out on their own.  For example, Narusegawa (one of Keitarou, the male protagonist's two main love interests) is basically a nicer/warmer Asuka from Evangelion (w/ nearly identical face/hair + same seiyuu) and the director has a tendency to pose her for the camera like Belldandy from Ah! My Goddess.  Keitarou is, of course, a bit more geeky version of Keiichi from A!MG.
There are also several scenes throughout Hina that tastefully alludes to other animes.  Heck, Hina even has its own Pikachu (well, sorta).  Ph. D. candidate Seta is pretty much Fujisawa Sensei from El Hazard, but with (get a load of this...) Dragonball Z frenzied fighting style.  My words don't do him justice.  You must watch him in action, and you'll hurt from laughing from the Dragonball spoof episode.  Finally, my favorite... Motoko, the kendo girl.  You'll see her ""succession techniques"" resemble Kenshin's Hiten-Mitsurugi-Ryu in more ways than one.  They're just downright funny.
Anyway, the best part of the anime is probably its formulaic, but extremely well-done love story.  The nerdy guy w/ pretty girls motif is found in countless # of animes, but I've not seen it executed so wonderfully as in Love Hina since A!MG.  There's also a Spring and a X-Mas special that pretty much wraps up the love story between Narusegawa and Keitarou, and they're not to be missed.  If you're going to buy any anime this year, I'd suggest you put Love Hina at the top of your list, along with Kare Kano.",1012780800,5,2001,5.006042296072508
1664537,5,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina, surprisingly very well-known among all anime fans, has finally made its way here to America. A series spanning 14 manga volumes, 24 episodes, 2 specials, 1 oav (episode 25), and the soon to be released in Japan, Love Hina Again (3 episode OAV).
The series stars a helpless 20 year old ronin (a person who didn't pass the college exams) named Keitarou Urashima. Throughout high school, he never got really good grades and never had a girl friend, yet one of his earliest childhood memories was of a girl. The memory was very vague but he remembered that they made a promise to go to Tokyo University together because if two people in love get accepted, they will be definitely be happy forever. His whole reason for going to Tokyo University was for that promise and the only girl he really loved even thought he doesn't even remember who she was. Well in the present day, Keitarou decided he needed to get out of the house so he decides to go to his grandmother's Hinata Inn which to his surprise is now a female dormitory. This starts his lucky life with many beautiful women and possibly, one of them could be the girl he made the promise to.
The packaging of this DVD frankly turns me off. If I had never seen Love Hina or had never heard about it and just saw it on the rack, I probably would not buy it. The logo Bandai made up looks really ancient and something from the 70s or something. The pose and expression of Keitarou and Naru on the cover of the DVD does not suit them. While they do this for the comical scenes and where they are annoyed with each other, the way they are remembered by fans is the subtle naivety of their feelings for each other which was expressed in the Japanese DVD covers which I hoped that Bandai would use or something to that effect. For this reason, I made my own DVD cover as a replacement. The DVD Series Box that comes with this DVD looks okay. I wouldn't say it was as special as the Cowboy Bebop box. The Japanese DVD Box used manga art which I didn't think fit too well so by using the anime art for the english box was a good idea.
The music of this anime is amazing as well. The opening and ending are performed by Megumi Hayashibara who plays the role of Haruka Urashima (Keitarou's Aunt). They put in song what the series about: both the comedic and dramatic appeal. Some of the BGMs are amazing and even all the voice actors lend a hand to create some character vocals that do get shown in the anime.
Love Hina is an anime that isn't necessarily for everyone. It deals with minor perversion multiple times but never really shows any nudity. So if you're a person that knows they are offended by this, then this anime might not be for you. To me, what makes this anime special is the fact that it gives me a light-hearted feeling after I finish watching each episode. Each character has his/her own depth that you can relate to. It's humorous, sorrowful, dramatic, all at the same time. Ken Akamatsu (Creater of Love Hina manga) made perfect characters and an amazing story as well. This is a definite must-buy.",1012003200,27,3072,4.4007029876977155

Love Hina (or 'rabu-hina') is about a poor loser named Urashima Keitarou, whose trying to get into Tokyo U, the prestigious university where only 1/3 of the people who take the entrance exams gets in. Why does he want to get in when he's already failed twice? Well, when Keitarou was little, he made a promise to a little girl that they would meet and fall in love at Toudai. Unfortunately, she moved away and Keitarou doesn't even remember her name! So, out embarks Keitarou to fulfill his promise.
One day, his grandmother leaves her inn, Hinata-sou, in the hands of Keitarou as a caretaker. Keitarou is astonished when he finds out that it is an all-girl's dorm! He meets a cast of wacky and fun girls that inhabit the rooms of Hinata-sou. They include Narusegawa Naru, a bright girl also studying for Toudai; Konno 'Kitsune' Mistune, a girl who always cons everyone out of their money; a foreign girl with a jungle for a bedroom, Kaolla Suu; Maehara Shinobu, a shy junior high school student; and Aoyama Motoko, 'kendo girl' with deadly fighting skills.
So what happens when Keitarou happens to be attracted to Naru? As the adventures unfold at Hinata-sou, it gets better. The opening sequence and song is extremely good, and I'm not sure, but I heard that Love Hina uses digital animation. If they did, it is beautiful because there is fluid movement and surreal colors. The opening song, 'Sakura Saku' is very catchy and fun to listen to. I was automatically hooked to it. Please buy Love Hina. It has a bit of romance, a bit of comedy, a bit of drama, with a lot of parodies.",1009843200,,1663,4.621621621621622
1664541,5,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina is a romantic/comedic anime based on the shonen manga by Akamatsu Ken. Love Hina (or 'rabu-hina') is about a poor loser named Urashima Keitarou, whose trying to get into Tokyo U, the prestigious university where only 1/3 of the people who take the entrance exams gets in. Why does he want to get in when he's already failed twice? Well, when Keitarou was little, he made a promise to a little girl that they would meet and fall in love at Toudai. Unfortunately, she moved away and Keitarou doesn't even remember her name! So, out embarks Keitarou to fulfill his promise.
One day, his grandmother leaves her inn, Hinata-sou, in the hands of Keitarou as a caretaker. Keitarou is astonished when he finds out that it is an all-girl's dorm! He meets a cast of wacky and fun girls that inhabit the rooms of Hinata-sou. They include Narusegawa Naru, a bright girl also studying for Toudai; Konno 'Kitsune' Mistune, a girl who always cons everyone out of their money; a foreign girl with a jungle for a bedroom, Kaolla Suu; Maehara Shinobu, a shy junior high school student; and Aoyama Motoko, 'kendo girl' with deadly fighting skills.
So what happens when Keitarou happens to be attracted to Naru? As the adventures unfold at Hinata-sou, it gets better.

1664542,4,B00005UBKC,"There are 25 episodes in all to this romantic/comedy series as well as Christmas (fits somewhere after the 23rd or 24th episode) and Spring (wraps everything up) specials.  The short review would be, ""If you enjoy the Tenchi series, then you'll like this.""
There are definite parallels between the two.  The most obvious is one young man, Keitaro, surrounded by many women both young and old.  The main difference from Tenchi being Keitaro IS looking for love. I also felt this series provided more depth and development of the characters than the Tenchi TV series.  While the characters may seem formulaic at first, they do grow on you and you feel for each of them with their individual predicaments.  I will admit to being apprehensive with regard to US dubbing of this series because the Japanese voice acting is extremely good.  But, since I'm writing this nearly 2 months in advance of the US release of the DVD, I'll reserve judgment on that.
To me, the motto of the series would be, ""Dream your dreams and don't lose hope.""  There are many twists and turns in the series plot, but everyone does come to a realization of their dreams either by attaining their dreams or gaining a better understanding of what their true desires are.  Most of all, this series is an entertaining and funny roller-coaster ride on many levels.",1008460800,3,1330,4.752173913043478
7954327,2,B00005UBKC,"Here is my 4/10 mangaupdates review for the original manga. The anime is identical, has filler episodes and no ending: Both the anime (i just glanced at it for confirmation) and manga are bad but the manga is a bit better done and just listen to me and Bennett the Sage as his Love Hina reviews are very funny and insightful. We both sure hate Akamatsu equally but dislike his Negima (3/10) more than this circle jerk so me and ecchi/harem will never be friends. No character development, no romance, no dating, no sex, thus no service i always say. I actually started to dislike the series half way through when i read it more than 10 years ago as a teenager so the art and the very first stories are the only saving grace. To think i actually played my own money for this. Ah the sins of youth but i learned and the harem genre has been dead to me ever since so thank you Love Hina for that. A good series about an actual harm would be Ooku (8,5/10) and the deconstructive Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei (9/10) should be the final word on the genre. At least this series isn't porn in disguise but Akamatsu does yuri/loli hentai on the side too. Sigh.",1450396800,,1147,4.364485981308412

7954329,5,B00005UBKC,"I'm a huge collector of anime. I started to read the manga a few years ago and got hooked. Unfortunately Suncoast went under years ago, so I couldn't buy the discs from them. Our blockbuster also went under, so I couldn't go and see if they had it for cheap, and everywhere else that I looked would've charged $29.99/disc--providing that they even had individual and not box-set of it... Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,784,4.451388888888889
7954330,3,B00005UBKC,"Charm is a quality to be treasured, especially in anime, where fighting, and nastiness has a tendency to get all the glory. This series has a substantial amount of charm, and I truly believe that that is a good thing. However, there are a few problems.
The story revolves around Keitaro Urashima, a twenty year old man with a mission; to get into Tokyo University to fulfill a promise made to the only girl who ever liked him, so that they can magically live happily ever after(huh???) Unfortunately, he's a sub par student and now under increasing pressure to give up his dream and get a job. However, due to the retirement of his grandmother, he finds himself left as apartment manger of an all girl dormitory, which solves his need for a job, but complicates everything else.
If this setup seems all too familiar, that's because it is; very typical fish out of water stuff. That said, I really kind of like Keitaro and the girls. These characters are interesting, if a bit stereotypical. What I found less attractive are the little things.
One finds out quite early that our hero has an active fantasy life. Unfortunately, it intrudes so often that it really interferes with the flow of the story. Also, as one can imagine with one guy and five girls, there are misunderstandings and a bit of violence. The thing here is that the violence is so exaggerated, it makes Looney Tunes look tame in comparison. That would be more of a problem, except that when one watches some of the goofy things that our hero does in the course of the day, you almost want to hit him yourself. I mean, there's a difference between being naive and being a total nut.
What is left in the end is an interesting, if somewhat silly story that has at least a certain amount of promise. This story has nice moments, when people see eye to eye, and opinions change. But make no mistake, this aint Shakespeare. That said, I think there's something worth getting here. The only question is...what?",1228867200,,1970,4.599431818181818
7954331,5,B00005UBKC,"I had never heard of this anime until a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon the first episode on youtube. I totally freaked out, I had too see more. But alas, no more to be found. So I came here, read about it and ordered a used copy.
This really a great anime, I am a fan of ""Fruits Basket"", ""Death Note"", ""Chobits"",and ""Ranma 1/2"" so this one is right up my alley. It has a great story so far, not alot of cursing, no ""real"" nudity (Like Ranma 1/2).  There is ALOT of violence, not bloody or anything, it almost always leaves me laughing. But if you're going to watch it with your kids and you're real sensitive about that kind of stuff, take a look at it yourself first. So far all the violence has been the poor guy getting the heck kicked out of him by one of many girls, but as I said it's mostly funny.
All in all I love this, I think you will too",1208736000,,849,3.9649122807017543
7954332,1,B00005UBKC,"Love Hina is one of the worst comedy/romance anime that I have ever seen. The main character, Keitaro Urashima, is so incredibly annoying actually so is the most of the other female character in Love Hina. Mainly the humor being used in this anime mostly has to do with incidents that being wrongly accused of Keitaro for being pervert and get beaten up by Naru Narusegawa.

I didn't actually bought this anime series which I am so glad that I didn't, although I do regretted for having to rented up to volume 4 of Love Hina, therefore I didn't liked this series I did watched up to episodes 16. I still can't stand this series as I watch along through volume 4. Storyline was weak nothing really interesting happen throughout the whole 16 episodes for me.

Do get me wrong I actually like comedy/romance anime very much myself, in fact my favorite anime of all the time is Ah My Goddess TV series. (Not the OVA, the OVA was okay but not as great as the TV series)",1177632000,,964,4.410112359550562

Well, because I can. Never buy an anime with the main character as a male because usually they turn out to be some sick fantasy such as this anime.

7954335,5,B00005UBKC,It's no wonder why Keitaro gets beat up by girls cause he's too nice and nevers want to fight back. He does need to go to a Tokyo University just because he made a promise when he was 5 that was a long time ago. Shinobu who is shy and also hats males well I hate her. I love the series.,1118880000,,286,3.7049180327868854
7954336,5,B00005UBKC,I personally own the whole series and have owned them for about 3 years. This was my first collection and still is my favorite. It begins with a boy named Keitaro Urashima and how he is determined to go to Tokyo University. The reason is because of a promise that he made with a little girl when he was 5 years old. Later on his grandma invites him to go to the hot springs and little did he know that it was a all girls dorm. Since he arrived his grandma left him in charge and now he is the owner of the Hinata Apartments. Later on he realizes that one of the girls that lives in the dorms might be the little girl that he made his promise to and now he is out to find out. This is the start of a very promising anime and a great collection. P.S The ending is actually decent because it actually ends the way you want it to!,1115942400,2,826,3.9520958083832336
