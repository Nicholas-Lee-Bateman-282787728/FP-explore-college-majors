I didn't notice, the language of the film is Italian, so English was in sub-titles... a feature I don't normally like very much, but it was a wonderful story about a courageous young woman who gave her life for being a Christian.",1359936000,12,314,4.508771929824562

5401675,5,B00A9XP25G,"Not to disagree with other reviewers, but I loved this movie.  It made me cry, my own personal criteria of a deeply moving movie.  When I first saw the subtitles, I thought: ""Oh, no!  Not another foreign movie with subtleties which are only understood by native speakers of the language!""  I was right, but I was wrong.  The subtleties are there, but they translate not in words, but in imagery.  The acting and scenery of this film are beautiful.  The subtitles are not distracting, but make you focus on each word --- no glancing at the clock or your I-phone or talking to your friends; you are absorbed into this movie, much like, I felt, The Passion movie.  In fact, some images, like the wailing of the father over his daughter's death at the end seem taken right from The Passion.

I'd encourage you to focus not on ""what REALLY happened to St. Barbara,"" but rather just the movie. It is a movie about love, a mother's, a friend's, and eventually, about God's love.  You don't see any Christian evangelizing done, in fact you may wonder at the end why Barbara even became a Christian; no doctrine was preached to her.  But it's not that kind of movie.  If anything, it presents what was really happening back then, and what was a noticeable thing about Christians, during that period of wars and terror and man's abuse of his fellow man.  The ""strange,"" noticeable thing about Christians, as quoted by Roman historians, was: ""See how they love one another.""  This movie showed how, initially, it was Christian love and sacrifice which made Barbara a convert.

In the movie's presentation of Roman citizens, I saw much of our society today.  There were good people, there were laws intended to be good, and there was a state which said its laws, ANY laws, were supreme over any religion.  And many good people couldn't understand why Christians wouldn't obey those laws, ""made for their good.""  Many still don't understand today.",1358294400,27,1934,4.705357142857143
5401676,4,B00A9XP25G,"Creative story of  Saint Barbara who has several legends surroundig her martyrdom.  She is claimed as the patron by a variety of organizations as well as cities throughout the world.  Visually beautiful scenery  and good acting help to  bring this time of persecution of Christians to life for younger audiences who may not have any knowledge of the early Christian church.
English subtitles are available since this is an Italian production.  Reading English subtitles could pose problems for younger readers.",1358208000,4,510,5.3125
5401677,5,B00A9XP25G,"The title of this DVD 'St. Barbara: Convert and Martyr of the Early church' pretty much tells the entire story. So howcould one make a movie about a saint of whom we know very little, relying mostly from the ""Golden Legend"" and make it into a full length movie and of course heaping on it a generous measure of artistic license without corrupting the original story? Well, apparently from what I've seen....very succesfully!
What we need to do is draw parallels between the little fact we have and compare it with the movie.
The facts:Barbara was the daughter of a rich pagan named Dioscorus. Her father, wanting to preserve her from the influences of the world, has he shut up in a tower. However she secretly becomes a Christian (you can't stop the Holy Spirit!).The father, enraged has he dragged before the prefect who orders her execution and she is killed by her own father. As punishment for his wicked deed, the father is struck by lightning and burned.

The movie: The opening scene shows a little Barbara being caressed by her beautiful mother who is singing her a lullaby. The girl wakes up startled, crying for her mother. Barbara's father, the governor of the town, tells her that her mother has left them and isn't coming back. 15 years later. Barbara grows up to be a beautiful,intelligent and affectionate girl. No expense has been spared in her upbringing, and her father has her well protected and sheltered from outside influences (The tower allegory). Her best friend and confidante is Juliana, a slave girl, whom Barbara treats as a sister and has her educated as well, grudgingly so by the father. One day a prefect arrives in her town to round up Christians (it is the height of the Diocletian persecution). Since Barbara is the governor's daughter she is seated next to her father on a dias watching the proceedings as the town's people are forced to burn incense as an act of worship to the emperor. She is horrified to discover that Juliana and her classmates are Christians. And here begins the saga of one woman's quest to acquire freedom for her friends and in the process to come to the fullness of truth, both personal and spiritual, that will eventually lead her to her martyrdom. The martyrdom scene is extremely moving.

Vanessa Hessler, the actress who plays the role of Barbara does a great job of bringing out the strength and courage of the saint onto the screen. And she is very pretty! The rest of the cast does an equally fine job, as well as the sets and costumes adding to the cinematic experience.

What I don't like about the DVD is that, it doesn't have a chapter selection option.
The only exta feature is the movie trailer. Subtitles are in Espanol and English. Running time 100 minutes.
This DVD package doesn't come with a booklet which is a signature of most Ignatius films.....but then what do you expect it to contain? The fact that she was locked up in a tower?I've told you that already!!! :)

To conclude, a great catholic movie on fillial love, friendship, charity and God with just a little romance thrown in for kicks! Don't miss it!",1353888000,50,3092,4.667889908256881

5401691,5,B00A9XP25G,"So my wife and I sit down last night and decide to check out the movie ""Saint Barbara:  Convert and Martyr of the Early Church"" on EWTN.  I was skeptical to say the least.  For one thing Barbara, the daughter of a rich pagan named Dioscorus, lived around 300 A.D., a period in history that I am not particularly interested in.  To make matters worse we quickly discover that ""Saint Barbara"" is an Italian production with English subtitles.  I did not expect to be around for long.  However, much to my surprise this film grabbed my attention from the outset and simply did not let go.  I watched it all and was deeply moved by it.

Barbara, portrayed masterfully by Vanessa Hessler, is a woman of great compassion  She was just 20 years old when these events took place around 303 A.D.  We learn early on that for reasons that are not made clear Barbara's beautiful mother was taken from her when she was a very young child.  Barbara's father Dioscorus is an entrenched  government official who feels threatened by the rise of Christianity in his area.  Christians are not to be tolerated and are routinely put to death for refusing to renounce their faith.  Although Dioscorus attempts to shelter her from the world,  Barbara is deeply impressed by the courage of the Christians that she encounters in her life.  She is eventually moved to convert to Christianity knowing full well that in spite of her father's position her decision could very well lead to her execution.  Barbara endures the slings and arrows that come her way with exceptional courage and grace.  This is a story you will not soon forget.

As far as I am concerned ""Saint Barbara:  Convert and Martyr of the Early Church"" gets high marks in just about every area.  The acting is superb and my wife and I agree that the music was exceptional.  Vanessa Hessler gives what can only be described as an unforgettable performance in portraying Saint Barbara.  I must confess that I could not take my eyes off her during the entire film.  I was also duly impressed with the rest of this very talented cast and with the splendid photography as well.  Furthermore, the climactic event in this film will blow you away.  If you are even remotely interested in ""Saint Barbara"" then would urge you to give it a look.  You will definitely not be disappointed.  I have already ordered a copy.  Very highly recommended!",1417910400,13,2374,4.653012048192771

5401702,5,B00A9XP25G,"This 2012 Italian film (English subtitles) tells the story of St. Barbara, a young Roman noblewoman who lived during the last great persecution of Christians under Emperor Diocletian in AD 284-305. As Diocletian struggled to keep the barbarian-harassed Empire together, he believed that returning to its traditional religion was essential, and he commanded all his subjects to burn incense to the gods on pain of death. St. Barbara, whose over-protective pagan father Dioscorus was governor of Nicomedia (Asia Minor/Turkey) at this time, was caught in the middle of what early Christian histories recall as the most sustained and violent persecution of Roman Christians prior to Emperor Constantine's legalization of Christianity just a few years later.

There are a remarkable number of Catholic martyrs from this period, including St. Valentine and the arrow-riddled St. Sebastian, but we know very little for certain about them. This film accordingly takes some imaginative liberties in portraying St. Barbara interacting with St. Juliana and St. Marcellinus, the bishop of Rome (pope) at that time, utilizing just enough creative license to fill in the details of a period in Christian history that has very little documentation since the Church was essentially underground for its first 300 years. It is set at a time when there was no ""Bible"" as we know it today, but merely scattered copies of the gospels and other New Testament writings that had not yet been formalized in one canon or list of sacred writings. Very little evidence of these Christians remains today other than their graves in the catacombs below Rome, where they buried their dead to avoid desecration by Roman pagans.

Here's the shocking thing about this movie, particularly considering that it comes from Ignatius Press: It's really good. ""Saint Barbara"" is full of haunting imagery and music, well-written scenes dramatizing the dilemma of choosing the Roman Empire or Jesus Christ, and remarkably detailed recreations of this period in Roman history. Vanessa Hessler, an American-Italian model and actress, is riveting as the young woman who gradually evolves from ignorance of the world around her to impassioned Christian witness.

Like most Italian religious epics, ""Saint Barbara"" is hopelessly melodramatic in spots, but is so well-acted and nicely stylized that it's hard to quibble. The dramatic sequences are compelling rather than flat, with characters torn between their Christian and secular commitments in a convincing way that feels somehow contemporary, and the film rarely drags or devolves into hokey digressions. There is nothing magical or phony about it, as the film favors a gritty and realistic approach to its material, and there's an underlying texture of ""hopeful melancholy"" that registers well on screen. I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in films about Christian saints or about the tensions between pagans and Christians from this period in Roman history.

The DVD itself is slightly better than bare bones, offering ""play"" and chapter stops in addition to English subtitles (on/off) and a nice theatrical-style trailer for the film.",1396483200,6,3154,5.3785425101214575
5401703,5,B00A9XP25G,"This movie is well acted.  I've learned a thing or two about watching these Catholic movies however.  They should be watched and listened to in the language that they were filmed in.  Use the subtitles people!  When you opt to hear it in English - they are unbearable to watch because the mouths do not match the voice, and the expressions on the face of the actors do not match the voice.  So I highly recommend this movie - but you absolutely MUST watch it it the foreign language format, with English subtitles.  If it's your first time watching subtitles and you are not comfortable with it - HANG IN THERE!  Once you relax, you brain will process faster than than you can imagine, and soon you do not even notice the subtitles!  If you want to watch it with the English dubbed in, go right ahead, but you will only get half the experience.  Sadly, Christians are still being persecuted in our world...",1396137600,4,906,4.475609756097561

Yes, she was martyred for her Catholic faith and saved a handful of believers but I felt there should have been more.
