7848827,5,6303491014,"I saw in TV yesterday an ""ANTV"" an episode of Alfred Hitchcock presents"" called "" The gloating place"". It was interesting. I liked it. What I'm  wondering is how come is not in any of the Season Volumes? I have all 6 seasons and this episode is not there. And a few weeks ago I saw another one I didn't recognize. Is there any other season volume I'm not aware of? Please refer to me if you can.
Thanks

7848828,4,6303491014,"I can just barely remember these episodes and am astonished that they were on for 10 seasons. I'm wondering if someone can help me, like you did for the other reviewer.

 I have been looking for an episode I saw years ago. I remember it was in black and white and as far as I can tell it's not a Twilight Episode.  All I can remember is there was a little white girl who had a doll or 'walking doll' as I used to say since I had one just like it. It was about as tall as she was so it wasn't a shelf doll. But the doll came to life when no adults were around.

One scene I recall vividly is the girl playing ring-around-the-rosy and a man hears two girls singing and giggling and looks outside and he sees a glimps of the dolls dress flinging as it skips around with the girl.

Anyone know what I'm talking about? If you know the name of this episode please let me know! I'm dying to see if I can find this episode.

Nurses were being murdered.  The episode showed an open window thus the murder was able to gain access to the house.  What is the name of that episode?

7848832,5,6303491014,"This ""GoodTimes Home Video"" release contains four fine episodes of Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s television series, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". .......
""The Horseplayer"" (with Claude Rains).
""Man From The South"" (featuring Steve McQueen and a subtly ghoulish Peter Lorre, who appears more than willing to use that chopping knife he's holding above the hand of a nervous McQueen).
""Mrs. Bixby And The Colonel's Coat"" (with Audrey Meadows starring).
""A Dip In The Pool"" (Keenan Wynn).
I enjoyed all of these programs, with the Lorre/McQueen outing being the standout.
This VHS video is a good addition to anyone's Hitchcock Collection.",1066348800,14,629,5.494845360824742
7848833,3,6303491014,"This video is a selection of four episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" that have to do with the issue of gambling.  The First Episode is ""A DIP IN THE POOL"" and is about a man played by  Keenan Wynn who is obsessed with gambling, and when one of his bets appears  to be in trouble he feels that he must take drastic steps to secure it.  The Second Episode is ""THE HORSE PLAYER"" which tells the story  of a priest at a struggling parish who has his beliefs about gambling  tested by a new member of his congregation.  The third episode is  ""MAN FROM THE SOUTH.""  When a strange little man challenges Steve  McQueen's character to a little wager, Mc Queen may stand to lose something  that he has ""grown very attached to.""  Finally this video  rounds out with ""MRS. BIXBY AND THE COLONEL'S COAT.""  When the  title character receives an expensive gift she is faced with sneaking it  into the house without her husband asking any questions.  Over all it  was a good video.  For anyone that is not acquainted with Hitchcock's work,  the stories may seem a little bizarre; but that is one of Hitchcock's trade  marks.  The style of this series is much like the ""Twilight  Zone.""  If you like that series I extremely recommend this video.",948931200,22,1234,4.504545454545455
