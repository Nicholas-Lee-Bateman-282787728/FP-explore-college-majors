5563532,5,B00B90P8AC,"In the middle of nowhere there is an old monastery, where a boy lives with his parents. His beloved mother is unstable and commits suicide, his father is aloof. At the same time, the real mother of the boy is approaching, but without success...
This is a magnificent, unique film about the torments of a young teenage boy, combined with elements of myth, dream-like sequences, and incredibly affecting music. Images are almost painterly, like Caravaggio-paintings.
I would compare this films with something akin to a mixture of some of Thomas Mann's greatest novels (Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain) + the sinister parts of ""Fanny and Alexander"" by Ingmar Bergman, with the photographic eye of ""The Tree of Life"" by Terrence Malick. Highly recommended, though a word of warning as it is not easy viewing, as its taboo themes are strong.",1360022400,7,837,5.028776978417266

8564354,4,B00B90P8AC,"This is described as a slow view into the mind of a troubled boy whose manipulative mother commits suicide in front of him. Now that is true but there is so much more here to absorb. The father is far from perfect and seems to want to keep the boy isolated from the World in the cocoon of a monastery he seems to have appropriated by less than fair means.
** Mild Plot Spoilers ahead**
There are recurring images of rotten and decaying fruit, the monks who have lost their home and visions of the mothers torments for having been born barren. There is also a fair bit of child nudity. I was not sure if I like this film or not. The camera work and direction are all exceptional and the actors do above average for what must have been a difficult piece to act.

The plot itself is a difficult one and the moments of alienation that are employed seem to be so deliberate as to throw the viewer off kilter. It is slow in places but obviously this is deliberate and helps to build the tempo for what is to come.

This is not for those who like their films packaged and sign posted in an easily digestible format. Nor is it true arthouse in that it uses wider cinematic techniques to allow its story to live and indeed die. From director Ivan Noel who also brought us Primary  Primaria and They Returned, he is not shy of controversial material and has a keen eye for what looks good on film  this is worth a punt for those who seek that something a little bit different.",1451952000,,1466,4.243727598566308
8564355,5,B00B90P8AC,A crazy mom slowly dragging her child into the depths of craziness while everyone else stands by and watches.  Wonderful cinematography.  Ivan Noel is one of the best independent film makers of our time.  This is one of his best.,1447804800,,229,4.675

8564357,5,B00B90P8AC,Ivan Noel has made his mark again in the small independent film scene.  Some of his other films like En Tu Ausencia have also shown him to be a great director and filmmaker.  This movie is a graphic depiction of a troubled of mother an son that ends in tragedy.,1399075200,,261,4.2
8564358,5,B00B90P8AC,"One either loves or hates Ivan Noel's films, I'm a lover.  Much of this film was spontaneous improv and that shows with searing moments of authenticity, some extended.  No gratuitous nudity.  One cute scene has the young lad at the center of the film peeing in the bathroom sink while simultaneously brushing his teeth:  there must be a message here, right? or maybe it's just a joyful illustration of the intrinsic spunk and spontaneity of this boy even as he is weathering the stresses of losing his mother and of a father severely distressed and distracted by her death.",1397692800,,573,4.757575757575758
8564359,3,B00B90P8AC,"Partly deceiving , but really thrilling in other aspects. The young teen actor is fantastic
since his role is quite complicated.
In this movie, everything concurs towards  a  tragic ending.",1371340800,,189,5.266666666666667
8564360,4,B00B90P8AC,"Mr. Noel has made one of the finest psychological drams I have seen in years . Mr. Noel actually gets inside the characters heads , which the main character an autistic ( presuming ) boy of 12-13 years , that in itself is an incredible accomplishment . The mother and father of the child were equally presented in a fashion that Mr. Noel turned their minds over to the viewer and let us see inside .
  I will not tell the story , that should be experienced .
  I personally was outraged , due to the fine performances of Romina Pinto , Juan Carrasco and Ana Karina Juarez , all of whom did their jobs with highest professional standards and finesse .
 I wanted to rip this poor child from their arms and take him to a safe ,  protective and loving  environment .
  The boy played excellent by Renzo Sabelli , thankfully and mercifully did not ""HAM"" his part , he played the part with maturity and self awareness that few young actors of the ' tween '  years are capable of .
 Some may say this is not a movie for everyone....I disagree but that is moot .  It is not for children and 'sensitive' teens . This movie deals with a sensitive subject of mental illness , autism (Asperger's syndrome ,etc.) parenting and the abuse psychologically and physically of a child that cannot defend himself nor tell anyone .
 My point about the movie should be viewed by all (with exceptions noted ) is the increase of autism and autistic like variations and how they are manifested and how any child can be so manipulated to a degree of which I would like to pretend that it does not exist...but it does exist and is going on all around us ! It is not pretty , sometimes life is not pretty , we have to look at both sides to get the whole picture .

  Special note to the cinematography by Mr. Noel !
 Also Peter Scholz ....  co-producer  and Paul Sestina ....  executive producer

I would have given 5 stars , however the subtitles were very small and that pisses me off...... but that's just me.",1370390400,4,1984,4.308108108108108
8564361,5,B00B90P8AC,"Mr. Noel has created a new masterpiece, after 'En Tu Ausencia' and 'Brecha'. Noel is probably the most
attention attracting Spanish cinematographer of the present. His movies are subtle, sensitive and both
storyline, camerawork and music are astonishing. Astonishing too is the fact that all this,-story, music and camera-,
are works of his own hand. Nevertheless his movies are made with an extremely low budget due to both lack of finance
and of recognition. I wonder how long it will take before Arthouse lovers will realize that there is a new Spanish
master in our midst. 'Vuelve' is highly recommended (and so are his previous films).
