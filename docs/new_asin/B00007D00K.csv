7975135,5,B00007D00K,"This DVD gets used 3 times a week, and I look forward to it.  I am 69 years old and found that I had to take it easy at first and not push too hard.  However, after a month I have limbered up so well that I am moving better then I have for years.  It is a great routine for any age!",1403395200,3,282,3.4444444444444446

7975137,3,B00007D00K,"The quality of the product is good, cues are easy to follow.  I just prefer something with more variety that includes stretches, weights and some aerobics.
