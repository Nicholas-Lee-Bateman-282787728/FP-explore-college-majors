1650336,2,B00005QW6Z,"The main problem of this DVD was the overreliance on the movie for everything. The historical data was good and interesting but frequent use of movie cutscenes ruined any atmosphere. This DVD attempted to be both a behind-the-scenes featurette and a documentary and pretty much failed as both to be interesting and watchable.
The format of the DVD was a ""Question and Answer"" and short simplified answers were given (though some were good) that was in total 53 minutes long. The special features consisted of old news reel stories and propaganda (which had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor) with a short explanatory info blurb tacked on. $ for this seems totally unrealistic.
I personally recommend Tora! Tora! Tora! as being more consistant and enjoyable.",1034553600,6,755,5.048

7951012,5,B00005QW6Z,"When my ""Civics and Economics"" middle school students have difficulty comprehending some of America's more difficult social and economic struggles from the past, we relate visual history with current times (economic, social, and post 9-11 issues).  ""Pearl Harbor - Beyond the Movie"" is a perfect visual source as we compare and contrast events, all for a better understanding and appreciation of what it takes and has taken to protect our freedoms and keep America strong.  ""Pearl Harbor - Beyond the Movie"" is life as it was without the Hollywood love story drama.  A refreshing but realistic perspective of our history.",1362182400,,621,5.19
