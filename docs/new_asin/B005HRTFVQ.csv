8473600,3,B005HRTFVQ,"I've watched a number of videos of Switzerland's Jungfrau Region including DVDs by Rick Steves (Austria and the Alps), Rudy Maxa (Best of Europe: Beautiful Europe), and the Travel Channel's Samantha Brown (Passport to Europe: Germany, Switzerland and Austria), all of which were professionally made. This video by Joseph Rosendo was made by what I would call an ""advanced amateur"" meaning that while it was better than your typical home movie, it doesn't quite rise to the level of a professional video.

The good news is that except for a trip to the Jungfraujoch, Europe's highest railroad station near the top of the Jungfrau mountain that is shown in practically every Jungfrau Region video, this video spends most of its time showing things in the Jungfrau Region not seen on any other Jungfrau Region video, including a visit to a goat farm, a street fair, and a parade in a small Swiss village. The host also takes a hike to a hut high up in the mountains. So if you already own a video on the Jungfrau Region, and you want a different perspective on the area, this video will do the trick.

The problem is that even though the writer and host, Joseph Rosendo, seems like a friendly and well-meaning guy, he isn't up to the level of a professional host or writer. The video is also only 27 minutes long, which is way too short for a DVD.

I think that this video is a good value only if you are renting it for two bucks from Amazon Instant Video. If you are paying full price for the DVD, well, I think it's overpriced.

In my opinion, the best DVD on the Jungfrau Region is a Rick Steves DVD called ""Austria and the Alps"" which not only contains an excellent 30 minute video called ""The Best of the Alps: Switzerland's Jungfrau Region"", but it also has six other 30 minute travel videos on the DVD of other areas in Switzerland and Austria. And, for about the same price as this DVD, Rick Steves' DVD gives you 3 1/2 hours of video instead of the skimpy 27 minutes that this DVD contains.",1340064000,2,1996,4.490358126721763
