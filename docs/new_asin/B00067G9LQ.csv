8039761,3,B00067G9LQ,"Cry of the Werewolf, 1954 film

People's memories record the past. This may explain the legends of werewolves and vampires. A guide shows the exhibits in a museum. Werewolves have a lust for killing. Next we see a gypsy camp. They talk of ""Marie La Tour"", a famous werewolf who killed her husband the disappeared forever. A scientist is interested in a new discovery. There is a scream then a howl! Where is Dr. Morris? The police investigate this death, caused by a large animal. A woman's fingerprints and hair from a wolf were found. Who burned his notes? Infrared photography can detect the writing on burned paper (new scientific fact). Elsa was born in Transylvania (a province, not a country). The janitor says he is not afraid. ""Do you believe in werewolves?"" Is there anything strange about Dr. Morris' death? A cat reacts to a human. Animal instinct? We see the person.

The police gather evidence - a hand-print on a door. The janitor is the suspect. He visits the gypsy camp for help, but he has attracted the attention of the police. Where did that canine come from? There is a scream from Jan. Will he join his ancestors? We learn about the daughter of a werewolf! The police learn that Spavero in no longer a suspect. Morris' son Bob questions the princess about her tribe's activities. Who is ""Marie La Tour""? There is a reaction. No one is allowed to see the records of the undertaker at ""Adamson & Sons"". Abut Bob uses his initiative to explore the basement. Where did that canine come from? Bob leaves quickly. Then he goes to the gypsy camp with Celeste, who questions him. Did he learn anything? This tribe uses matriarchal lineage. Elsa warns Bob, she senses Celeste is evil. ""A love doll!"" Elsa studies the portrait of Marie La Tour. ""Your mother!"" Else is told her fate, and she faints.

Bob returns to look for Elsa. Where is she? Bob enters the hidden room and finds a changed Elsa! ""I killed him."" Was she hypnotized? Suddenly the lights go out. The police enter the hidden room. Bob sees a pistol in a desk drawer. The police find a hidden crypt. They shoot at the wolf and hit it. Elsa found that pistol, what will she do next? ""Kill him!"" A canine attacks Bob, the police shoot this dog. Upon death the werewolf returns to his or her human form. Unbelievable? But you saw it with your own eyes.

This is an average lower budget movie. No expensive technical effects, we see shadows of the animals. It echoes the movies from the early 1940s (when more movies were made about vampires than werewolves). A werewolf returns to its human form during the day, his family and friends are unaware of his or her condition. Until this secret life is revealed.",1351728000,,2679,4.575

I recommend you buy this from amazon, if you enjoy great acting and enjoy wetting your pants. Your old western pal, Kevin",1288396800,2,261,4.24
