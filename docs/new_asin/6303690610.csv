710534,4,6303690610,"CLASS REUNION MASSACRE (1978) aka The Redeemer: Son of Satan! was not quite what I expected - I thought that this was going to be a Satanic slasher film but it was definitely more of a twisted religious film.

Not a very convincing religious movie, be it considered slasher film OR Satanic horror. The story itself, is not very believable and is played out as if it were a typical slasher movie; six former students attend their tenth year class reunion and get murdered.  The murders have something to do with a child (son of Satan?) who comes into sight out of an inland lake and a mysterious, zealot preacher.

There is no suspense. There really aren't characters, only some that classify as religious archetypes.  The biggest problem is that the movie is two things that directly counteract each other:  religion vs Satan.  You watch former students getting stabbed by a religious preacher.

Being a lover of horror films and watching the good, the bad, and the just Really bad, it was comforting to watch a bizarre old 70's horror film.

A mysteriously strange premise for a horror film, but not great execution. There are no twists, no surprises, and at the end of the film, you feel like the movie was more about seeing former students get killed than watching a religious Satanic story.",1281657600,7,1294,4.72
710535,2,6303690610,"We have here a very old scenario: a maniac is stalking former classmates at a small high school reunion and brutally murdering them. The movie begins with a mad priest giving a ranting sermon about ""those who have not followed the path of righteousness"" which is being taken in by a young boy who is then seen emerging from a lake(?). Flash forward 20 years or so to the group of morons at the class reunion: a glutton, a lesbian, a woman who hunts and kills birds for pleasure, a greedy lawyer, a promiscuous blonde and an arrogant, talentless actor (of which this movie has no shortage of). Predictably one by one they are killed off in unimaginative ways, though admittedly the ventriloquist's dummy roasting a guy with a flamethrower is a nice touch; as is the maggot scene. In fact, all the good scenes feature the dummy who along with the hammy psycho, gives the movie's best performance. 1986's SLAUGHTER HIGH features a similar plot but is just as bad. When it comes to high school revenge movies, you still can't beat CARRIE though.",1030406400,,1041,4.632432432432433

I knew this man personally. Not only did he have no acting talent, he pleasured in tearing people down. Maybe I'm biased, but it's true.
He has had such a bad acting career that he couldn't even get someone to write his IMDb page. He had to write it himself, and I would bet that the top review on here is by him too.
He tried, with little success to teach to his classes about his acting experience. Everyone knew that he was a failed actor. Everyone knew that he was a disgrace.

710658,5,6303690610,"Flashback to 1979. I was 9 years old and the neighbors took me and my 2 sisters to see a terrible movie at the drive-in called Prophecy, which was some foolish mutant bear nonsense. But we stuck around to see the 2nd feature, and that was the one far more worth seeing. It was some previously unknown movie from a couple of years earlier titled The Redeemer. I remember being transfixed to this movie, and found parts of it very disturbing to my adolescent mind. When we got our first VCR in 1986, I tried all the local video stores to see if anyone had a copy of The Redeemer to rent, to no avail. I desperately wanted to see if those scenes I recalled had only been romanticized with time, or if they were in fact still effective: the boy coming out of the watery lagoon, the two thumbs, the living marionette with a sword, a man getting a knife in his head from above, a bathroom sink drowning. I thought I may never know

Jump ahead to 1997. I was having my first exposure to the internet and one of the first things I looked up was this movie. I found that it wasn't just a dream or from my imagination after all. It had definitely been released on VHS, though had also been renamed for some pressings to Class Reunion Massacre. The following day I went to the local video store I had been going to for years, and there it was! I eagerly snatched up Class Reunion Massacre and shoved it into the VCR with such excitement that Im surprised I didn't break it.

I watched the movie with great intensity, wondering if I would think its just a piece of 70s cheese or if I would still find value in it. I found myself getting chills during the playback as I saw all of the scenes that haunted me for nearly 2 decades. By the end of the movie the verdict was clear. I loved it! It had everything about those low budget 70s movies that I loved. The filming was very soft focus at times, creating a distinctive halo of light around windows and objects, adding an eerie element. Some other camera tricks were also effective, as were the excellent primitive analog synth sounds used to add to the shock value on certain scenes. The overall music was very dark and haunting, relaying the aura of doom that lay before the cast. Some of the acting by the secondary cast was a little hammy at times, (best exemplified by the carhop waitress girlfriend), though much of the primary acting was just fine.

The story revolves around an over-the-top preacher going on about sins and punishment. His ranting is interspersed with footage of former students talking about attending their upcoming 10 year high school reunion. Their sins are depicted as being such trivial things as greed, being gay, being trampy, being a glutton, or being a rich snob. The unsuspecting victims soon realize something is amiss when the 6 of them are the only ones at the reunion, and the doors have now been locked. One by one, each student meets their fate by the hand of The Redeemer. Each time The Redeemer takes a victim, he is in a new disguise; a bird hunter, a clown, wearing a bizarre puppet mask with a flamethrower, etc. Some of the costumes are pretty bad, such as wigs being painfully obvious, but it adds a creepy element to The Redeemers performance. By the end of the film, the deeds are done and the lunatic preacher finishes his sermon.

The dream-like touches in the film amplify the impact. Seeing things like the kid coming out of the water (despite the terribly tight rust colored 70s pants hes adorning), a mystery school bus in the desert out of nowhere, the mystery second thumb (which has been puzzling to anyone who has seen this film, and even the filmmakers themselves), the living marionette, etc, all give this film a truly haunting quality. I can understand why this film divides horror fans because its one of those that you either get or you dont. Some also view the film as unnecessarily cruel, though I choose to view it as exposing the double standards and hypocrisy of religion. My take on the second thumb is that it was transferred to The Redeemer as he performed his duties, providing him the extra powers subtly portrayed in the film (disappearing from a locked bathroom, waving his hand to animate the marionette), then returning to the devil kid when all is done.

A special note should be given to the performance of T.G. Finkbinder as The Redeemer. I think he does an amazing job of changing disguises and voices, and find everything about his performance very intriguing. Ive read fairly recent interviews with him in which he fondly recalls his time on the film, and how the kids that he teaches in his current profession all get a rise out of the movie. Im very happy the film retains a small but dedicated cult following, and I rank it as one of my favorite films ever. Whether or not its because of the personal nostalgia attached to it or any inherent quality is anybodys guess, but I love it.

I purchased The Redeemer DVD on the Code Red label at the time of release. There had been talk for so many years about the movie being released by this label, and originally it was going to be a special edition. In the end, it was just the film and a trailer. I would have loved at least an interview with Finkbinder relaying tales from the set, etc. But the long-awaited DVD release was a partial disappointment. The print used was in very bad condition, tattered and torn with the ravages of time. The label states that the negatives are long lost and none of the few prints they got their hands one were very good. There are constant scratches in the film, dirt and spots. But all of that could have been somewhat forgiven if it weren't for some of the reel changes being chopped so poorly. As the Cindy character tries to tell her drunken boyfriend she is going to her reunion, it abruptly cuts in the middle of her sentence. Im sure with having a few prints at their disposal, Code Red could have attempted to piece together the best quality reels of film for at least a complete representation.

But then much to my surprise, a blu-ray edition was eventually announced. Despite the expected quality, I snapped it up. Its pretty much the same print as the DVD with the addition of one really damaged scene just after a character had been the victim of a shotgun blast. I can find some charm in the films condition because it adds a certain character of those old drive-in movie days, though I wouldnt have objected to a little more care to the presentation. Also, the blu-ray is lacking the trailer from the DVD and there is no sort of menu. The disc simply plays when you put it in and stops at the end. But all in all, Im happy to have this obscure little treat on blu-ray, and will treasure it as the collectors item it has already become.",1419897600,3,6759,4.459175424413905
710659,5,6303690610,"Code Red does it again by finding a little-known 70's slasher film with religious overtones, giving it the proper restoration treatment and releasing it to unexpecting audiences. The Seven Deadly Sins were never deadlier, as a boy with two thumbs on one hand (!?!) helps kill the seven people responsible for making one man's life a living hell during his time in school.

Like Phantasm, you can tell this is the director's nightmare he made into a movie, especially when there's no explanation why things are happening.

If you like surprises in your horror, with this, you can't guess how the next scene will go down. The priest expresses his evil with several disguises from his own personal, insane bag of tricks. Well acted (especially by priest T.G. Finkbinder) by one hit wonder actors. The soundtrack matches the creepiness on screen and deserves credit for not letting you relax between kills.

710663,1,6303690610,"As my review heading says, I am a fan of this obscure pre-Halloween 70's slasher horror film with a supernatural twist.  However, what Code Red has given us as a product is simply unacceptable.  I honestly have to say after having bought the DVD version of The Redeemer, I feel that Code Red should be utterly ashamed of themselves.

First off, the print of the film they used is AWFUL!  It is filled with visual blemishes that eat a LOT of the screen (not in the good Grindhouse-style either), the audio is in horrible condition and certain scenes are clipped short due to the print skipping seemingly.  I understand they could not find the master print or an original negative of the film. However, there is something else they could have done. They could have gotten the rights to use the print from the Continental VHS release. For one, The Redeemer was shot in full screen and matted into widescreen (like many low budget horror films back in the day were), and not to mention that the Continental VHS print is actually gorgeous and in a very crisp, colorful condition with little to no blemishes. Sure it carries the Class Reunion Massacre moniker but if that was a big deal, they could have done what I do and just have grabbed a freeze frame (the opening shot over the credits is freeze-framed anyway) and used a program like Vegas Pro to recreate the original title, and also matted the film into widescreen as it was originally intended to be.

But here's where the biggest offense comes from. Not only is the print on the DVD in terrible quality, but there is also no chapter selection at all for it, no special features (not even an interview with TG Finkbinder who seems to enjoy talking about the film? Come on!), the fact that aspects of the menu seem to condescend to Code Red's target audience (i.e. the ""Pointless Code Red Trailers"" bit on the main menu) and the DVD slip cover features nothing but negative review quotes and a plot synopsis that only acts as a means to poke fun at the film on its expense.

Knowing how the owner of the company has behaved in the past, and is also prone to making hasty decisions before reviewing all the options first (the Madman DVD fiasco anyone?), it seems that due to all the trouble he had securing a decent print of the film, he got all huffy and decided to take out his dissastisfaction upon the movie and fans of it. Maybe I am speculating too much but given the history of the company & having seen some of the tantrums the owner of Code Red has thrown on horror movie forums over upcoming/current releases, it wouldn't surprise me one bit. Due to this, I have to call them out on their childishness and their poor treatment of the film & its' fans.

No extra features, no chapter selections, condescending packaging and not even using a decent Continental VHS print (which we would have been happy with since the print they used is so horrible!)... It's abysmal and I say Code Red should be ashamed. They have painted themselves as nothing but poor sports in the world of DVD distribution.",1325548800,6,3053,4.538181818181818
710664,4,6303690610,"How can one compare a film like ""Redeemer/Class Reunion Massacre"" to other slasher stinkers which became the horror norm in the early eighties?  Released the same year as the original ""Halloween"", ""Redeemer"" is quite different than its famous cousin.
Its quite obvious both slasher oldies boast insane killers, but the one in this film is quite premeditative in his tactics (going to the great extent of converting an old Military Academy into a deathtrap, complete with fencing, barred windows, flame thrower, and a wide array of cosmetic appliances in which he employs to confuse his victims and remain annonymous).  Not only does the Redeemer plan ahead and spares no expense, but he also is fueled by a motive! (if killing in the name of the Lord is a way to rid oneself of that annoying third thumb, than by all means, kill those who are with sin!)
*spoilers follow*
Most can agree, Michael Myers embodies pure evil, evil which needs no introduction, motive, or reason. In the ""Redeemer"", the killer is also an embodiment of evil.  But one could argue that the killer is also a victim of a much greater evil, an evil which emerges from an isolated lake, hops onto a sunday school bus, and curses the Redeemer with a third thumb and the desire to kill sinners!!! Did I mention a third thumb? Crazy weird.
If oddball slasher films are of interest, ""Redeemer"" should not be overlooked. IMO its much more entertaining than most of the Friday the 13th franchise thrown together.
Code Red didn't try to restore this film very well, and perhaps they simply wouldn't risk the funds to do so. They claim on the packaging and on the disc that the noticeable damage is due to the horrid condition of the source print. Reel changes are very grainy, and there is a vertical green line visible for much of the film's runtime.  Despite a sloppy transfer, Code Red  DVD garners points in my book for putting forth the effort and releasing this unsung slasher oddity in widescreen format for all the little horror fans to enjoy. Code Red DVD is doing great in picking up where companies such as Anchor Bay and Shriek Show have left off.",1297382400,4,2124,4.683646112600536
710665,3,6303690610,"This movie is basically about a psycho killer priest who wears disguises & kills sinners who he recruited to a class reunion. He gets the ability to kill from an evil child. A lot of people compared this to the Omen because of the child that is involved in the film, but to me it reminded me more of the movie Frailty in terms of its religious message. Its not about a boy taking over ala Damien but of a person who wears some really creepy disguises to kill people who are sinners in (well in some cases) hideous ways all in the name of God.
There are some pretty intense murder scenes in particular one in the ladies room. There is one terrific gore scene & some other cool things to recommend. The acting is ok, as is the story ..pretty simple - nothing that can easily be confusing if you follow it from start to finish. Some would say it isn't clear why these murders are happening to this group of people but if you read the text at the beginning & the end it is clear to a certain extent. There is a meaning to the killings. And he is killing those who have sinned.
It is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but it was a credible sincere effort. If you are a fan of films Crucible of Terror, Horror High , Horror Hospital and other low budget independent titles that companies like Code Red, Scorpion Releasing or Synapse Films would release , then Id recommend it easily.
Dont expect too much and you'll be rewarded.
Code Red released this with the disclaimer about not being the best transfer 'we did the best with the elements we found & released it due to popular demand"" type of thing
I found the transfer to be pretty viewable & despite the reel changes where it gets really grainy like something from Alpha Video, you can tell Code Red tried to make this as good as they could get. Id get this version over some of the other versions out there..
So while this film isn't recommended for the general public who focus on mainstream titles like Avatar, Iron Man etc..this is for those who do have a passion for the independent low budget horror film fan. I was curious enough to buy it and was pleased with it..",1288137600,14,2134,4.297766749379653

A stereotypical slasher film this is not. On VHS, the title of Class Reunion Massacre was most likely used to cash in on the whole slasher trend of the 80s. I found the cinematography to be incredible. The acting wasn't bad either. This isn't your regular 'piece of cheese' horror film. It was shot well, and overall, had good production values. It does have its 'cheese' moments, as most films of the genre do, but I can look beyond them. Also, I'm sure this film had a political subtext AGAINST Christianity. Showing how a crazed religious fanatic (the priest) committed murder under the justification that he was eliminating those who sinned. I also believe that the character of the little boy from the lake was the apprentice of the priest. That's how his character comes into play. I really wish the director kept making horror films, he could've done something incredible. Love it or hate it, this film is MEMORABLE. It is Not some shoddy piece of garbage that you want to forget. All in all, The Redeemer:Son Of Satan isn't just another over-the-top slasher gore-fest. Its something more.

Special effects and camera work were generally poorish, but about par for the course given the age of the movie.  The acting was ""o...k..."" as well...

It looks like this movie may have set some of the bars for ""how to write idiot characters"" in slasher films.  Multiple times do they suffer from the ""We better stick together, so you go that way and I'll go this way"" syndrome.

And, just when you think the characters have a good idea ( like let's light a fire, so the fire department will come ), they give up on the idea...
