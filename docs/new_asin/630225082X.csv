7822859,4,630225082X,"John Cena is the good guy.
His wife is kidnapped.
The others are bad guys.

It's a pretty much routine ""catch the bad guys and get your loved one back"" type of film, but this one has John Cena.

You may, if you wish, follow the plotline and watch all of the fantastic chase scenes and the brilliant explosions.

Personally, I'd rather watch Mr. Cena in various degrees of dress and undress.  Dry and crisp in appearance or totally wet with his clothes clinging tight in all the right spots.",1261267200,,490,4.411111111111111

7822861,4,630225082X,"This short (50 minutes) documentary is narrated by WWll veterans of the US  Merchant Marine, US Naval Armed Guard, and steelworkers of the Kaiser  shipbuilding yards.  The video, with its rare black-and-white footage,  spotlight on veterans, and music soundtrack, is of the same general quality  as televised episodes presented on ""The History Channel"".  Its  focus is on the importance of the convoy system in delivery to our Allies  of desperately-needed supplies.  Unbeknownst to the American public, losses  were staggeringly high.  Archival action footage of torpedoed ships and  sailors foundering in the sea remind us of the thousands of men who died in  their perilous duty -- and explain why my own father recurrently awoke from  nightmares for some thirty years afterward.  Those interested in the  subject of this video will also appreciate Humphrey Bogart's classic  adventure film ""Action in the North Atlantic"" and Jan de Hartog's  fictionalized novel about Convoy PQ-17, ""The Captain"".",965433600,8,1000,5.42483660130719
