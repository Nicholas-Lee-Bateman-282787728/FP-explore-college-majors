8149203,5,B000J4OYQI,"While many fans of TNA (""Impact"") Wrestling have become disappointed in recent years with the product put out by that company, this, in the opinion of this reviewer, represents some of the best that has been produced, back when it seemed they were attempting to be ""the alternative"" to the WWE's dominance of the sports entertainment business.

The focus of this two volume set is the high-flying performances of the ""X-Division,"" wrestlers who are mostly smaller in size or build (called ""cruiser weights"" or ""junior heavyweights"" in some other promotions), but highlighted for their speed and acrobatic abilities, performing stunts many of the larger wrestlers would not regularly attempt. This takes the form of regular matches, tag matches, steel cage matches, and the infamous ""Ultimate X"" (a variation in which wrestlers attempt to scale small towers attached to the ring posts and retrieve a belt or ""X"" symbol from two intersecting ropes suspended above the ring). The participants regularly perform flips and dives, both in and out of the ring, and intricate moves requiring flexibility and grace, in addition to the usual maneuvers one expects to see in the squared circle (though the matches in this collection all feature the six-sided ring, a rather unique feature of TNA that was present for at least half of the company's run and is used by some promotions in Mexico).

The standout stars of this collection include continuing personalities like ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles, ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels, ""The Samoan Submission Machine"" Samoa Joe (a man a bit large for the division), Austin Aires, Alex Shelly, Chris Sabin, as well as others not as often seen in the company anymore, like Amazing Red, ""Prime Time"" Elix Skipper, Senshi (Low Ki), Shark Boy, and those currently in other promotions, like Ron ""The Truth"" Killings. Next to the heyday of the Knockouts Division, this was some of the most popular wrestling seen in TNA.

While hardcore fans of WWE may sneer at the lower production values and lesser known talents, fans of TNA should appreciate this set, and fans of wrestling in general should enjoy it. Possible criticisms could include it being light on story, high on ""spots"" (stunts), so while there is some background provided about the rivalry between Daniels, Styles and Joe, many of the various wrestlers may take some getting used to if one is not familiar with their careers and characters already. Those who prefer the more plodding pace of matches between muscular giants as seen during the 80's WWF may not like this change of pace, but most should find something on these two sets to enjoy. Even so, the novelty of the Six Sided Ring (and Six Sides of Steel), Ultimate X, and the high flying cruiser-weight style wrestling should hold your interest for at least a few matches. Some of the announcing is a bit annoying, but that's a common criticism of televised pro-wrestling.

There are also a few places on the discs where it is clear there was a commercial break, and we don't get any footage from when the cameras cut away, which is a disappointment. Additionally, a few of the commercial breaks actually simply black out the screen, and the viewer is literally sitting there in the dark, for the duration of the ""commercial"" until the show returns, already in progress. I thought this was rather sloppy, and should have been fixed. Thankfully there is the fast-forward function.

There aren't many extras, just a few bonus matches and filler segments (apart from the aforementioned history of the rivalry between the top three X-Division guys at the time).

Regarding content, some more sensitive or younger viewers may find the violence disturbing (and there is some blood shed in the more grueling matches), and there are a few off color references here and there, but generally nothing one wouldn't expect to see during a prime time event on TV, certainly there is a lot more extreme ""wrestling"" out there.

I can't recommend this set enough for anyone interested in seeing what this wrestling promotion has had to offer.",1338768000,,4081,4.975073313782991
8149204,5,B000J4OYQI,This twin-pack dvd is a steal for the price. The matches are great and you will feel a little sad when comparing this with the current product.,1289174400,2,143,4.333333333333333
8149205,5,B000J4OYQI,"This is a package of both ""Best Of The X Division"" TNA DVD's put together.  Vol. 2 is the exact same DVD that you would find if it was packaged seperately but Vol. 1 has been changed in the the back cover reflects all the correct matches on the set & the 2 disc set was combined into just one.  And on the bonus section of Vol. 1, they forgot to take out the commercial break during the bonus match so you actually hear all the commercials.

Here Are My Original Reviews For Both TNA DVD's so you know what your getting:

Vol. 1:
1. Victory Road - 20 Man Gauntlet Battle Royal
The format is similar to the Royal Rumble except only 20 guys & short time interluded. You'll see old favorites like Spanky, Psychosis, La Parka, Hector Garza along with TNA regulars like Matt Bently (with Traci), Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt and others. Fun match.

2. Victory Road - X Division Champion Petey Williams vs. AJ Styles
Unfortunally, this is one of the flops of the DVD because this match was really short (about 10 mins.) and it's constant interfearence from William's manager Scott D. It would have been better to put the match from the Turning Point PPV with Williams vs. Sabin.

3. Impact - Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin
Nice overall match but it's clipped.

4. Final Resolution - Ultimate X Match: Williams vs. Sabin vs. Styles
If you never seen an Ultimate X match, it's really something to watch because high spots put off in this match are really something that will keep your guys on the ring. Watch AJ get kicked off the top & flipped inside out. The ending was something I didn't expect but it creative. Great match.

5. Against All Odds - Ironman Match: Daniels vs. Styles
This match specifically is for those who say the X Division & TNA in general is full of ""car crash matches & high spots"" as they give you their high flyin' along with great mat wrestling for a full 30 mins.

6. Destination X - Ultimate X Match: Daniels vs. Styles vs. Primetime vs. Killings
The rules for this match was different than usual as you have to eliminate two participants in first a tag then triple threat match before the Ultimate X match actually starts. Long match but with the stiputlations, it never really gets boring. Teh ending was a real screwjob but what would you expect from the lead heel in the X Division at that time

7. Lockdown - Ultimate Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley (with Trinity) vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt
Similar to the previous match, you gotta elimate two other participants before the actual match starts. To win, you gotta be the first to escape the cage. It was a photo finish in the end & overall a great match but the real show stealer was Trinity's moonsault from the top of the cage.

8. No Surrender - AJ Styles vs. Sean Waltman with Jerry Lynn as the guest referee
It was a average match for me but the best Waltman has looked in years.

9. No Surrender - Samoa Joe vs. Chris Sabin
Unfortunally the only Joe match on here but perfectly shows that X Divsion is about no limits, not weight limits. Joe's style is similar to that of the ""shootfighting"" that Taz & Ken Shamrock used to do with the stiff kicks & punches. Great match to showcase Joe.
Note: Also available on the Samoa Joe DVD

10. Interview with Jerry Lynn
Just a basic interview with Lynn talking about the beginnings of his career, how he got into the business, his favorite fueds, ect.

In the bonus section, they have two matches from Impact featuring Triple H (Daniels & Primetime) vs. Amazing Red & Sonjay Dutt and also a six way match with AJ Styles vs. Kid Kash vs. Amazing Red vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelly vs. Kazarian. Both of which are clipped & nothing really special.

Vol. 2:
This DVD showcases some X division matches from the past year just like Vol. 1 did. This release does have some positives & negatives though.

The positives are that they didn't spend the whole DVD on Joe/Styles/Daniels since we've seen those matches on Joe's & other DVDs and just only had around a half an hour of highlights & commentary. Also in that respect, it gives a great showcase of those X division wrestlers who were overshadowed in that fued like Petey Williams, Chris Sabin, Alex Shelley and the returning Senshi (Low-Ki).

However, the negatives I can say about this is that they really put alot of matches from Impact that either had other outside storylines/interference going on that took away from the match or were a quick squash match. Also this DVD had too many three/four way matches with everyone getting their high spots in before the finish so it really because repeatitive & loses it value after a while (ala the 5 Abyss thumbtack spots on the ""Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD). The last X division DVD ended on June of 2005 so while there were tons of matches from Impact, they left out alot of X division matches that were DVD quality that could have been added instead of the repeatitve three/four way matches such as: Petey Williams vs. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger (Scarifice '06), the Ultimate X match between Joe/Styles/Daniels (the only match not on DVD yet), Chris Sabin vs. Petey Williams (Unbreakable '05), and other matches from the World X Cup of '06 & the Super X Cup of '05. Here's a list of the matches & keep in mind that the Impact matches are either kept short & clipped because of a commerical break.
