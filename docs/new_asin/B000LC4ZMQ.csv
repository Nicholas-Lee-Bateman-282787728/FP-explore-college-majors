8161339,3,B000LC4ZMQ,"I got this on VHS way back in 1985 when it originally came out, and enjoyed it - it's kind of like taking a private lesson from Terry, as he talks to the camera and states what he's about to play, then executes it at various tempos so you can wrap your head around the technique he employs casually and articulately. But times have radically changed since, and now if you're beyond rudimentary double-bass drum playing and have been woodshedding yourself, as many of today's players do (and should), it's somewhat dated and won't take you to another level of playing like watching Terry's newer things. His drum sound then (this was recorded back in the 'Missing Persons' days) was extremely flat and without resonance, except for his Roto-Toms (another dated example), and the video quality is murky and grainy by today's standards. If you've only been playing a few years, then bag it - you'll learn something of value that you'll keep forever. For more experienced players, check out his 'Live w/ the Tosca Strings', 'Duets w/ Chad Wackerman, Vol. 2' and 'OUTtrio' w/ Alex Malachek, and keep dreaming of playing like this legend. Long live Bozzio.",1290556800,3,1150,4.813131313131313
8161340,5,B000LC4ZMQ,on VHS....this was Bozzio's first instructional tape and gives a good introduction to his solo drumming conecpt as well as his ostinato playing that he later expanded upon. He covers grip and basic strokes as well as covering techniques for double bass playing. The solos are worth watching although his drum sound is a bit strange compared with his newer DW drum kits.,1212019200,2,369,4.873015873015873
8161341,3,B000LC4ZMQ,"If, like me you're a large FZ fan, then you will more than likely enjoy this video.  However if you're buying this with hopes of gaining some intuitive insights from Mr. ""Hands With A Hammer"" himself, good luck.  Don't misunderstand, there are some true nuggets in here, you're going to need to bring a bucket and an axe though in order to mine them out.  Terry does a much better job showing you how he does what he does than articulating how he does it.  He especially struggles through several attempts to explain complicated meters and time signatures but proceeds to just beat the ... out of an awesome drum kit.  There is however one previously unsung virtue of this romp through Mr. B's theories on percussion technique and that is Terry's hair.  It very much dates this work as a symbolic testament to the outrageous hair of the 80's, and for that reason alone make this an enjoyable excursion.  Enjoy!",1052265600,,910,4.614906832298137
8161342,4,B000LC4ZMQ,This has to be one of the best video I've seen in a long time. I will recommend it to all my drum buddys.  from Detroit ; glennray ;,952646400,,132,3.5517241379310347
8161343,5,B000LC4ZMQ,"Most proffesional drumset players have good rythm and beats, but extreamly sloppy hands. Terry Bozzio shows the rest how important of a quality it is to also have rudimentary skills on drumset. Shurely one of the Best  Drummers of this century.",929664000,4,244,4.951219512195122
