7926982,5,B00004Y7CS,"Operation Rogosz (oh-come on, he's supposed to be Hungarian-spell it right!) was the fourth episode of Mission Impossible, and in my opinion, it was the one that made the series what it became.  In the first season, there were still a lot of ""action"" scenes, shoot-outs, car chases and fist fights, but this episode doesn't have any of that, which is why it is so good.  MI, at its best is all about psyching the enemy out and brain is more important than brawn.  Fritz Weaver puts in a great performance as the consummately evil Imre Rogosz. Combining this with a very impressive job of directing by Leonard Horn and some very special camera work, we see a very intense and exciting story. One thing that is different about this episode from later ones in the series is that we see light-hearted banter between the members of the IM Force.  It was apparently believed by the later writers that this might detract from the tension of the story, but on the other hand, it makes the members of the IMF more ""human"" and believable.  I leave it to the viewer to decide which is a better approach.
One other factor that makes the story so compelling is that it is about bacteriological warfare, a subject that is unfortunately very relevant today.  Get this video and see the good guys win.",1058313600,10,1285,4.565217391304348
7926983,5,B00004Y7CS,"The great ""Operation Rogosh"" episode of ""Mission: Impossible"" featured the series' first time-displacement scam, with an environment completely recreated from scratch and a mission that, to be successful, had to be completed within a strict time-frame.  To one extent or another, this first-year installment set the tone for the rest of the series, and after 37 years, ""Rogosh"" is still fresh, and still a model of staging and editing.
Director Leonard Horn was a veteran of the sci-fi classic ""The Outer Limits"" (""The Man Who Was Never Born,"" etc.), as was writer Jerome Ross (""The Man with the Power"").  Other ""Limits"" tie-ins include directors Lee H. Katzin and Paul Stanley, as well as co-producer Alan Balter.
The second episode on the video, ""The Train,"" is more gimmick-reliant but quite entertaining, with one especially nerve-wracking moment.  To quote an early reviewer of ""Mission: Impossible,"" fine stuff!",979084800,10,917,5.310344827586207
7926984,5,B00004Y7CS,"Two classic episodes for a great price -- ""Operation Rogosh"" features a genocidal saboteur (Fritz Weaver) convinced three years has elapsed, he's on trial for his life -- and all he can remember to prove his innocence is to tell ""his accusers"" of the ""last"" great operation he was trying to pull off in America. Great psychological drama and a real cliffhanger ending. ""The Train"" also features some fun technology, including a IMF-rigged train crash that never was, a faked heart murmur with a microphone, and great acting from villain William Windom.",974246400,9,552,5.010869565217392
