5410030,4,B00ADSR962,"The best from the British Hammer studios. Haunting, atmospheric, well paced retake of the Bram Stoker vampire classic.  Christopher Lee is riveting as the menacing count on the loose in England. Being dogedly pursued by doctor Van Helsing (an outstanding performance by Peter Cushing). Well fimed by Terence Fisher, who keeps the film flowing and your attention throughout. Outstanding score!",1434067200,2,392,5.533333333333333

5410033,1,B00ADSR962,"I love this movie , but I hate that I could not get it to play on my PS3 . I believe this to be a region B blu ray only .",1424908800,4,121,2.8125
5410034,5,B00ADSR962,"Outstanding collection of supporting videos and, of course, the Blu-Ray of ""Dracula"" restored is excellent.  Especially interesting among the bonus features is ""The Demon Lover"" commentary by Christopher Frayling.  Frayling's analysis of the film story and underlying ""Dracula"" novel is the best, most penetrating I have ever seen.",1421020800,,331,5.875
5410035,5,B00ADSR962,"Hammer's Dracula original released in U.S. & U.K. cinemas way back in 1958
with screen ratio of 1:66:1
just before it was released to cinemas a couple of scenes were edited out
the scenes are where Dracula is about to attack Mina in her bedroom
that scene was cut short where the next frame is a screaming owl
this scene was longer version by 1 min where you see the full Erotic scene
and the last scene before the credits roll, Dracula turns to Dust was also edited by 1min
these particular scenes were thought to be to Erotic & Horrific for both British & American audiences way back in 1958
the U.S.,U.K., GERMAN DVD versions only had the existing theatrical version
the Japan dvd was the only version that had the extra scenes
well after many decades now these new scenes have been re-inserted in the existing Theatrical version
by Lionsgate U.K., Lionsgate were able to get these extra scenes from an existing Japanese print
and fully restore & given new 1080p HD transfer to the whole film

this new blu-ray reissue by LIONSGATE U.K. is a 3 Disc set which has 2 DVD Discs with it
Lionsgate added 2 DVD'S for fans who don't have Blu-ray players i guess.
in my opinion DVD'S are now old tech, blu-ray quality is the version to watch now
Disc 1 which is the Blu-ray disc has the now complete uncut version plus all the extras on 1 Disc
LIONSGATE have added 2 versions of this new Unrated cut which are both in the original 1:66:1 ratio
the 1st version is restored by the BFI from 2007
the 2nd is restored by HAMMER from 2012 which is the latest restoration of the film
i have watched both there's nothing different in my opinion, they're both have the extra scenes edited back in
the new 1080p HD transfers are the same which looks excellent, very sharp & clear picture quality
with only a Mono sound mix unfortunately, so the sound quality could've been much better a 2.0 master stereo mix
LIONSGATE U.K. have also produced all new special features which is a first for this film
a new 30mins Documentary DRACULA REBORN, interviews with writer Jimmy sangster,
the little girl that played Tanya-Janina Faye, Kim newman and others
RESURRECTING DRACULA which is about the restoration of the film including the lost scenes
that are now inserted back in the film
DEMON LOVER,Christopher frayling talks about Dracula
THE WORLD OF HAMMER TV EPISODE-DRACULA & THE UNDEAD
STILLS GALLERY of over 100 fully restored photos and images
plus a NEW AUDIO COMMENTARY BY MARCUS HEARN & JOHNATHON RIGBY
Disc 2 & 3 are the DVD Discs which have the exact same content spread over 2 discs
the only difference is the dvd has Digital remaster transfer of the film, not 1080p quality
this new U.K. blu-ray is region B locked so the dvd's are region 2
Warner bros owns Hammer's Dracula which still hasn't been given U.S. blu-ray reissue yet
and even if warners did reissue Dracula on blu-ray might not be the full uncut version, so don't hold your breath waiting
so if you love Hammer's Dracula buy this new U.K. blu-ray worth buying for sure
5 stars for it for sure",1414195200,9,3045,4.556569343065694

8550232,5,B00ADSR962,"GREAT get this one . because warner bros will never release the uncut restored version.
you will be waiting forever.",1518739200,,116,4.85
8550233,5,B00ADSR962,Excellent horror film with the great Chris Lee.  Just don't like it being region B.,1518566400,,83,4.533333333333333
8550234,5,B00ADSR962,THE definitive edition to have of this film. Loaded with extras. Can't ask for more really.,1517961600,,91,4.75
8550235,5,B00ADSR962,"After 60 years.... The film that raised the bar on the
future of vampire in cinema (and the bar still remains) Hammer dared to reveal the gore in lavish Techicolor as well as a 'viral' Count Dracula amid beautifilly staged sets (ONLY 3 sets were used due to budget) Peter Cushing's Van Helsing is so believable, you actually wish he was sitting in a chair across from you after the film is over. Lee gives the main character the needed aire of arrogance, entitlement, sophistication and deadly-threat. Finally, James Bernard's percussive score will keep you humming the 3 main notes. A MUST see for horror as well as classic cinema fans.",1515801600,,637,4.747747747747748
8550236,4,B00ADSR962,verey nice film,1494892800,,15,4.333333333333333
8550237,5,B00ADSR962,This blue ray will play on any system. It is the only blue ray disc of Horror of Dracula from Hammer. Outstanding fun movie.,1476144000,,124,4.208333333333333
8550238,4,B00ADSR962,"Awesome movie, but, unfortunately I have found that the PS4 won't play region B or C blu-rays. I watched the region 2 dvd once and then set my PS4 back to a region 1 setting(I won't be able to watch another different region dvd again because my PS4 would get locked on region 2 if I did it again).  I'll have to try to sell this some time.",1474934400,,339,3.985294117647059
8550239,5,B00ADSR962,Excellent dracula movie. Hammer and Lee at their finest. Rachel Smith.,1470614400,,70,5.454545454545454
8550240,5,B00ADSR962,"Finally, there's a version with an aspect ratio closer to the original, almost completely eliminating the maddening ""top-of-head-cut-off"" closeups of other versions on the market.  Color looks very good, but Blu Ray makes everything so sharp, you can't help but see grain; the restoration didn't seem to address that.  Still, this is the best version ever and deserves a permanent place in any Hammer fan's collection.",1459209600,,418,5.318181818181818
