6809017,5,B00PIVK8RG,"Love it!

The first movie was good, but I had the Big Apple Bake Off on video as a kid and watched it so many times. Like, so many that my sisters and I say things like 'bubblegum instead of strawberries' when most people would be like, 'let me play you this tiny violin'

The colors are good, the audio is clear, and all the songs are there.",1444608000,,342,4.014705882352941

8688166,5,B00PIVK8RG,"Try to remember: You're watching a kids' cartoon.

That's what I had to remind myself when the program started. I was into Strawberry Shortcake when I was a kid, but I had forgotten just about ALL of it. Hitting PLAY, I was thrust back in time to a much simpler day-gone-by. Silly and simple and sweet. Her little baby voice took me by surprise as did just how babyish everything was! The stories are even done in a rhyme, which Id COMPLETELY forgotten! I, of course, noticed neither the baby voice nor the rhyming when I was a little girl. However, I got into it, and I'm glad I bought this DVD. I don't have kids yet, but, when I do, I plan to introduce them to these characters. For a long time, I've failed to care for the sorts of cartoons being pushed today. I grew up a fan of this, Care Bears, Scooby Doo, Pound Puppies, etc. I want my kids to have a simple childhood, as free of political messages as possible. They'll grow up soon enough and be bombarded day in and out just as we adults are. Why can't we just allow kids their years of childhood innocence? This cartoon, I believe, does just that. As I said, it's simple. Strawberry lives with her cat, Calico, in Strawberryland. She has several neighbors, who are also her good friends: Huckleberry Pie, Apple Dumplin', Raspberry Tart... They all pitch in to raise berries and live a simple, sweet life. Maybe there's some subliminal-type message buried in there, but I failed to grasp it. Strawberry and the gang are the Good. The Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak is the Evil. But, by the end, Good wins.

The first story is an introduction to Strawberry and her pals. The narrator (I had completely forgotten about this) is the sun, whose voice sounds so familiar to me, but the names at the end didn't. Anyhow, I'd also forgotten the villain in this story and how he always dances when his name's said: the Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak (tah tah tah tah-tah-tah tah tah tah tah...tah!) (or something to that effect), which elicited a few giggles from me. I kid you not. It was as if I'd been reintroduced to an old friend!

The second story sort of leaves off where the first one ended in that Strawberry makes reference to the first story and how the Pieman had promised hed be good. His response was something akin to: the badness in me just cant be contained. Anyhow, in this story, Strawberry is in the running for a baking contest against the Pieman. She goes to Big Apple City (I think this was the right name for it) where she meets up with the other characters I remembered: Lemon Meringue, Orange Blossom (I think), and two others. In this one, theres a cute song between Strawberry (your basic white girl) and Orange Blossom (a black girl) about being friends. I thought it was sweet: Two girl who focus not on the difference in their skin tones but choose to focus on the similarities between them. Throughout the song, they sing about I like to sing and the other says, So do I. I like to play on the swings; So do I. Etc. At the end of the song, they're skipping away, holding hands, best friends with not a care in the world.

Again, there's nothing complex here. Just your average kids' cartoon. (Except for the big vocabulary words they introduce: misanthropic and petard. My mouth literally dropped when I heard them. There I was listening to a little girl with a baby's voice saying ""berry nice"" and then ""misanthropic"" was dropped out of the blue by the Pieman (or was it the sun?) and then ""petard"" in the second film! Wow! What a great way to expand your kid's vocab at a young age!) A chance for you to ""return to those thrilling days of yesteryear"" and for your kids to view pure innocence. And maybe, just maybe, you'll have given your child her first brush with baking! Who knows? Maybe the next Food Network baker will be born thanks to Strawberry Shortcake!

One final thing: I think there are more cartoons out there, just not on DVD. I hope someday soon theyll put the rest on DVD. Not that you cant buy the VHS version(s), but itd be nice to have a set all in the same format.",1498953600,7,4090,4.433510638297872
