2670773,5,B000JJ4DDW,My brother and I have been waiting for this DVD for years! Finally it's coming out in January and we can't wait!!!,1161129600,,114,4.2272727272727275
2670774,5,B000JJ4DDW,"It is ABOUT DAMNED TIME that this brilliant show was put on DVD!!  I mean really, it should have been on DVD not long after it went off the air in 1997.

Although there were a few clunkers on the first season (Dead Men Don't Flush, The Parents Are Coming, Radio Days and Do The Fight Thing immediately come to mind!), most of the episodes were straight-up hilarious; my all-time first season favorite is Checks, Lies and Videotape, with David Alan Grier as the skeevy Rev. Leon Lonnie Love.

I plan on buying all seasons (well, I may waffle with the last one, they weren't as funny without Gina!)....anyway, glad that Martin is finally coming, I can't wait until January!

Here are the episode titles:

1.  Beauty and the Beast
2.  The Gift Rapper
3.  Things I Do For Love
4.  Boyz 'R Us
5.  Dead Men Don't Flush
6.  Forever Sheneneh
7.  The Parents Are Coming, The Parents Are Coming
8.  Woman With A Past
9.  Baby, It's Cole'd In Here
10.  The Night He Came Home
11.  The Great Payne Robbery
12.  Three Men and a Mouse
13.  Radio Days
14.  I've Got a Secret
15.  I Saw Gina Kissing Santa Claus
16.  Do The Fight Thing
17.  Blackboard Jungle Fever
18.  The Break Up, Part I
19.  The Break Up, Part II
20.  The Break Up, Part III
21.  I'm Not Your Superwoman
22.  Credit Card Blues
23.  Jerome's In The House
24.  Your Arms Are Too Short to Box with Martin
25.  Variety Show
26.  Baby, You Can Drive My Car
27.  Checks, Lies and Videotape",1160956800,4,1438,4.211111111111111

2671243,5,B000JJ4DDW,"Martin was truly a talent and a visionary comedian.  His talent for mimicry far exceeded his peers.  He was a visionary in that he could create all kinds of characters and make people laugh.  He also had break out artist from the world of Rap, Hip Hop, and Blues.  If you want to see most of today's rappers in there early stages this was the show to do it.  Martin Lawrence was the show to watch in the first decade of the ninety's.  If I was having a really bad day at work I would go home and watch Martin on Youtube and get my laugh on.  And it would make any situation I was working through on the job, much better.  The saying ""Laughter is the best medicine"" is so true and this show could make you laugh til you cried.

Martin Lawrence was truly a genuis who was truly ahead of his time.  If you really want to know how people feel about Martin as a comedian, read the postings on YOUTUBE.",1261094400,,896,4.097701149425287

2671270,5,B000JJ4DDW,"""Martin,"" the self-titled sitcom that shot popular stand-up comedian Martin Lawrence to universal stardom still remains one of the funniest and best television situation comedies ever!
The show first aired on Fox in 1992, but still draws huge laughs like its still airing today. Need proof?, TV-One airs it about 90 times a day because of the huge ratings it garners. This first season featured some classic episodes like ""Forever Sheneneh,"" where resident ghetto chick Sheneneh Jenkins gives Kid of Kid-N-Play a date he will NEVER forget!, ""Checks, Lies & Videotape,"" where Martin and Gina set up a corrupt minister (played by funny man David Alan Grier) who is stealing money from Martin's mother, Momma Payne, along with other church memebers for his personal financial gain. This season also featured the three-part episodes where Martin & Gina break-up and ultimately make-up (Martin singing ""I Will Always Love You"" still gets a chuckle).
This disc is well worth your money. Sixteen years after its premiere, it is still just as funny as the days when it first started airing!",1210723200,,1082,5.084269662921348

Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell are truly talented actors, great show and outrageous characters created and portrayed by Lawrence himself. Definitely a great gift idea, I highly recommend this past time favorite. Enjoy!",1207008000,,381,5.47457627118644
2671273,5,B000JJ4DDW,"Martin Lawrence in his peak.  Hilarious characters, simple but funny plotlines.  Sesason one is the best of all the seasons.  In the later seasons they try to develop the storylines a little too much and the show becomes something it was never meant to be.  Season one is just all out craziness, silliness and nonstop laughter!",1204502400,,327,4.785714285714286
2671274,5,B000JJ4DDW,"Everyone from the Prince of Wales to the janitors at your middle school have seen at least one episode of Martin, and, if they have any type of sense of humor, they probably have seen more than one episode.  Out of its five seasons, season one is one of the best.  Martin is hilarious, but he didn't stop there.  He dressed up as an old woman (who played his mother), a ghetto girl (his neighbor), a wanna be pimp (Jerome), a bad, snot-nosed child (Roscoe), and a cool, white co-worker (Bob.)

 Martin Payne is a radio host with a cocky personality.  The main characters are he and his intelligent, down-to-earth girlfriend Gina, her snobby, smart-mouthed best friend, Pam, and Martin's best friends, Cole and Tommy.  In this season, we see the gang share a Jeep, Martin and Gina go at it on live radio,  Jerome and Pam date, Martin become angry because Gina makes more money than him, and so much more!

I highly recommend this DVD because its hilarious, and who doesn't enjoy a laugh sometimes? Easily 5 stars.",1203206400,2,1012,4.5777777777777775

I have always told her that when they put Martin out on DVD I will close up shop.  The other reviewers say it all.  Martin is here, and the world is a much better place.

I also remember when Martin and Gina got into a fight,she said something about his mommas biscuits, that may have been left out too.

From what I did remember, I knew I always laughed through it, but wanted to watch it again now as an adult.  It is absolutely brilliant.  Martin Lawrence is so funny and he plays different characters as if those characters were played by different actors.  Shenaynay (I don't know how to spell it) is brilliant.  I crack up every time after seeing her.  I also love the coke-bottle glasses wearing security guard.  Hilarious.
My favourite episodes were the Halloween night (where they scare the daylights out of Martin), and the episode featuring Keith Washington who played Gina's ex boyfriend.  The whole series is great and I am so glad I purchased this.  If you are a fan of old school comedies, then you'll love this.  It's so good.",1175904000,,839,4.64625850340136

  The cast is perfectly molded on the friendship/chemistry level; and you really feel that the characters are for real, for real.

I found a ""bootleg"" copy of all seasons on ebay, but still had to have this one.  I was a little disappointed in the extras/commentary/bloopers.  I expected a lot more.  I wanted to know more behind the scenes stuff and wanted Martin to comment on more of the episodes and characters.  He sounded as if he didn't want to do the commentary which upset me greatly.  Overall I still rate the DVD with 5 stars.  This DVD turns my gray skies blue on any given day.  Like I said, It's been a long time coming and I'm glad it's finally out.

2671420,4,B000JJ4DDW,"After the nostalgia wore off I realized many of the early episodes were more stupid that funny. Of course they have their bright spots like Moma Payne, King Beef, Gerome, Sheneneh etc. But all non-characters martin seemed weak in development. And it showed in their interaction with each other. So I was left waiting for the appearance of the next character played by Martin. The DVD set doesn't come into its own until the later half of the set. It seemed that the writers got their act together. The writers put everyone in their ""spot"". And no longer were the LOL moments restricted to Martin's characters. But the main cast provided just as much laughs. The future of the Martin DVD Collection does look bright for Season 2 when ever it's made. Because as Season one came to a close, the show was firing on all cylinders. If you were a fan like me and taped every episode to VHS when it aired, picking this up is a no brainier. If you were a little more causal about you Martin viewing, it's still recommend, there are still a lot of LOL moments in the set.",1171584000,,1061,4.446153846153846

I can't wait for the next season to come out.  Where's Bruh Man and Hustle man?  Get ready to laugh.  Dang, I remember when Tisha Campbell just had to leave the show over sexual harrassment.  As much kissing and slobbing as the do on the show, I'd probably try to get some too.  Who cares?

So when I recieved the first season as a birthday present, not only was I shocked, but extremely happy. I was just expecting a bare-bones transfer of the tv show to DVD but they actually included some added features that were a welcomed surprise. Audio commentary from Martin himself was a nice touch and you can never go wrong with bloopers and outtakes; they are usually the best part of the show. My only complaint was that there was not enough of it. It was only like 30 minutes on the entire disc. I want more!!! Other than that, I can't complain and I can't wait for season 2.",1170892800,,713,4.25

2671453,5,B000JJ4DDW,"Martin's show was possibly the best black television show in the 90's. Martin's comedic timing was flawless and the characters fit very well together. What made this show so popular was the way it related more so to the black working class as opposed to The Cosby Show. Although The Cosby Show was a great reflection of the upper class it by far was no Martin. I have been waiting for this DVD for some years now. And to my delight it has not disappointd, each episode had me laughing like it just came on yesterday. This is most definitely an add on to the DVD collection, a must have if you will. I highly recommend this DVD to all people who want to see good television. One more point, it is important to see how good Martin was in character as well. Jerome being my favorite and Otis not to far behind realy show the talent that Martin sustained. Sheneneh was just as good as well.

Martin Lawrence should be proud of this body of work and I hope he will reap the awards from this contribution to television history for the rest of his life and beyond.

Very few sitcoms have a decent pilot, but Martin's was hillarious, because I always loved when he did other characters like Shenehneh, Mama Payne, and my personal favorite the playa Jerome!!!

The episodes have crisp sound and picture, but my only complaint outside no decent extras is no episode guide. Even if there's not one included separately, they could have at least wrote the episodes inside the box set! I had to go on the internet to get the complete episode guide!

When I look back at the characters Martin created I think how great a talent Martin Lawrence is. Do you see this type of charactor actor today? not much (Jim Carey?) I was a little disappointed in the special features. Martin with audio only talks about the show with very little enthusiasm. I'm hoping at some point most of the cast will get together and talk about what made the show so good. I hope they take the time with the next season and give more behind the scenes look at the show.

While I can do without Stan and Martin's job at the radio (too much time at work and not enough at home with friends) the first season still delivered with comedy, and really funny characters. I remember talk about the show being too black or something like that.

I think Martin geared a lot of his jokes, in jokes and situations toward black people and a lot of them only someone black would get and that's another reason I loved this show.

It began to fail in the last season, after Gina left and Martin struggled on his own, so that may not be worth it. And under $25 is not a bad price.",1165536000,15,653,4.300813008130081

But my favorite was when Martin got that speeding ticket and he cut a fool in the court room.  I have my on order, you better get yours.",1163635200,,404,3.8780487804878048
2671586,5,B000JJ4DDW,I've been waiting on this for a long time also. I recorded some episodes from a marathon once but it's not the same. I like the episode where Otis has to protect Gina and Pam. That was hilarious. This is a great show. I can't wait.,1163203200,2,231,4.043478260869565
2671596,5,B000JJ4DDW,"FINALLY. I CAN THROW OUT MY VHS VIDEOTAPES.I SWORE I WILL NEVER THROW THEM AWAY UNTIL THE DVD CAME OUT. I REMEMBER BEING A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE MAKING IT A PIZZA NIGHT AND TAPING THE SHOW ON THE VCR. MY FRIENDS STILL MAKE A YEARLY DATE TO DUST OFF THE TAPES AND LAUGH OUR BRAINS OFF. I WILL BUY ALL SEASONS.

MY FAVORITE EPISODE HAS TO BE ""BOB"" FROM MARKETING. ""FOREVER SHENENEH"" AND DOES ANYONE REMEMBER WHEN BIGGIE SMALLS WAS LOOKING FOR A BACK UP SINGER, CLASSIC. I'M LAUGHING JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

AND WHO COULD FORGET THE ""RAT"" THAT MADE ITS DEBUT ON CILLIGAN'S ISLAND. AND HOW DEDICATED PAM FOUGHT THAT RAT.

I CANT WAIT.",1163116800,3,629,4.405172413793103

This one is so anticipated, I'm sure folks will put aside some of their holiday shopping bucks to get this one! Everyone I know still enjoys the repeats of ""Martin"" on their local TV stations, or TV-One Cable network. One of those rare shows that even leave you laughing even after repeat viewings. Count me amongst the many who are glad it's finally getting its' due. Hopefully the successive season releases won't take nearly as long to be issued on DVD!",1162425600,26,529,4.638297872340425

2671601,5,B000JJ4DDW,"Been waiting on this set for years.  Every show these days comes out right after the first season concludes, finally they put out a classic.  Martin and his characters were pure comedic genius.  The reviewer above mentioned some clunkers and I must disagree in her assessment on two of them.  ""Dead Men Don't Flush"" and ""Fight Night"", the introduction of Bra'Man were hilarious.  Can't wait until January.",1161734400,2,405,4.985074626865671
2671602,4,B000JJ4DDW,"One of the Best ""New Jack"" Comedies to come out in a long time why it took so long i don't know martin was a comedy/variety show all in one thats what made it so successful, im glad this came out a lil late to keep fans anticipating for it. Now watch it fly off the shelves like the chapple's show only reason I gave it 4 and half stars is becuse it wasn't a real strong season, but it had enough great shows to launch the show off to a great start",1161648000,,448,3.827956989247312
