The story begins at a big hospital in a big city (New York). A man in a hospital bed is examined by a doctor. Dr. William Byrnes meets an old friend. [Note those old reflex cameras!] Fire trucks arrive at a burning building. [Note the use of a stunt double and background projection.] There is a mix-up of patients. [Why they put on wrist straps for identification today.] Misidentification is a recurring theme in comedy. They enter the bank and do more comedy. ""They're tied up right now."" The alarm goes off! Bud and Lou are described as the bank robbers. Will their photos sjpw the real robbers? They pack their grip. Or do they? Travel long-distance then is by train. Musicians play music and a woman sings on the train. [You won't see those accommodations on an airliner.] The boys recognize the band leader. The train goes into a tunnel. Bud and Lou avoid the conductors. Finally they arrive in Sun Valley, the skiing resort. [Product placement again?]

Lou has an idea so Bud can play the piano and impress that singer. Can something go wrong? ""Alright."" Bud and Lou work as waiters. [Note that tile stove in the room, as in Central Europe.] They meet those three men in a room. Can that singer get the negatives? ""May I see it?"" she asks. There is another song for entertainment. `Where's Tubby?"" He drops in for more comedy and hits the ice. Peggy doesn't take orders. Bud and Lou go to that cabin first to try to find the stolen money. The three crooks arrive. Later they arrange to trade the negatives for cash. Can the Doctor and Nurse get help in time? Can Lou escape from the three crooks by using a cookie jar? [Its in the script.] The boys ski down the mountain. Two of the crooks aren't successful on the downhill run. A very big snowball follows Lou. It has a crook and a few small animals (for a comic ending). Bud and Lou wait while a very large sled carries the band and singers. ""Happiness bound"" is the last song. Bud is disappointed. Will he get on the Broadway Bound train? Did this movie distract people from their cares?

Those three character actors would be seen in many other Hollywood films (Joseph Sawyer, Marc Lawrence, and Sheldon Leonard). The latter two were in television in the 1950s.",1379203200,,2251,4.512254901960785
