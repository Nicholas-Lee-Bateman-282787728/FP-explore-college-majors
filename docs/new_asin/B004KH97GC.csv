8432942,5,B004KH97GC,"Mother and Battleship Potemkin are both landmark classics. They share some similarities as they are both Russian, silent, and about the 1905 revolution. Mother is about, well, a mother, who must deal with her abusive alcoholic husband, and her young son who is a secret member of the revolution. The son, Pavel, is arrested when the mother confesses her knowledge of a weapons cache hidden in the floorboards. After time in her bitter loneliness, as symbolized by drops falling into a water basin, she joins the revolt, and tries to help her son break out of prison. The film has brilliant use of imagery,examples, shots of the ruthless gloved hands of the police, the prison men marching in a circle to form a clock, the melting ice to symbolize the revolutionary change. Truly a classic, just as good as the much more famous movie also included, Battleship Potemkin.
Battleship Potemkin also has amazing visual, including the famous 1st ever montage on the steps of Odessa. It involves a mutiny that takes place during the revolution that starts with the poor conditions on the ship, specifically, the food. The captain orders those who are stirring trouble to be shot. This incites the mutiny. The people of Odessa side with the crew, whom they bring gifts of food and drink to. But, the police are ordered in to put the people down, leading to the massacre of civilians on the steps. What will the brave men of the Potemkin do? It's just a great historic masterpiece.",1296604800,2,1471,4.7952755905511815
