As for the other two, not only are they painfully dated (as opposed to ""nostalgic"" - a fine line, I know, but I'm drawing it) and rife with the usual problematic racial issues, sexism, and homophobia anyone watching these early Bond films knows to expect, but they just aren't that good. Mind you, both have little bits of classic Bond business that make them worth a watch for fans, but frankly these are about on par with the lesser Roger Moore entries. Depending on just how big a Bond fan you are, you may want to think about just getting Thunderball on its own.",1446422400,2,614,4.54054054054054

Sean Connery gave an amazing performance in these three 007 movies, but I gave the set a 4 star rating because I didn't care for the plotline of Thunderball overall.  Still though I am almost done with my 007 collection due to the fact I have almost every set for the collection only matter of time before I find the Sean Connery Collection Volume 1.  So in closing if your a big fan of 007 movies and enjoy the old school bond movies then pick this set up for the price of 15 to 20 dollars currently on Amazon for 3 movies well worth the price.",1487030400,11,691,4.180451127819549

7333661,5,B011KG2J60,"THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film. This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct. After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be.

The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. This film has always been a favourite with diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. I met a very young couple this summer at the beach club. I happened to mention James Bond. These two half my age immediately said, ""Thunderball!"" Do you like ""Thunderball?"" I replied, ""Absolutely. And by the way I see you are drinking Red Stripe Beer. Did you know that when Bond tosses Quarrel into those corrugated cartons in DR. NO those are cases of Red Stripe Beer?"" And so I met some new Bond fans. But going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE contained elements of espionage, action, thrills, adventure and science fiction. Looking back it somehow worked loosely when put together yet till this day I can not determine what the cohesive element was. Looking at it closely the film is a real dichotomy of styles. The first hour is excellently filmed and works very well. We get to see James Bond the spy, working with recognition codes, breaking into safes, going under cover and the like. There is an excellently choreographed fight scene between Bond and a sumo wrestler. This is also the first time he developed a good working relationship with a fellow intelligence head, Tiger Tanaka, similar to that of Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. We also see that ""M"" has absolute confidence in his man. ""This is the big one,"" he tells Bond knowing that 007 is the only one capable of pulling off this assignment. There is also quite a bit of very witty dialog in the first hour of this film. In the first hour the pace is deliberate, but never boring or not entertaining. The first hour ends with Bond flying ""Little Nellie,"" delivered by ""Q,"" into an aerial dogfight with four helicopters. As it moves into the second hour more of the science fiction and fantasy elements start to take center stage. The film starts to look untidy and meanders along till it gets to the excellently filmed battle between Tanaka's ninjas and Blofeld's private army in his Volcano lair. It's not a bad Bond film, but it should have been a lot better. I think the culprit was the editing. Russian and American manned space capsules were being snatched out of orbit by an ""intruder missile."" Bond had to find the location and the identity of those responsible before World War III breaks out. The filmmakers decided not to surprise us at the end of the film, but instead show us, not Bond, that this ""intruder missile"" is in fact owned by SPECTRE and is being launched from Blofeld's Volcano lair in Japan. That comes a little past the hour mark. That being the case there was a good opportunity to develop suspense, as Bond has to locate the launch site. When Bond finally does find the volcano he has very little reaction to his discovery. He in fact seems to have come prepared with suction cup kneepads, which he uses to climb upside down and into the volcano. Tanaka shows up with his men, the battle ensues and Bond saves the day. It just could have been done much better considering how well the first half of the film was handled. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were highly innovative and stylized and are probably the best of the entire series. M's office aboard the submarine, M-1, was also pretty innovative incorporating furniture and decorations from his office from the Ministry of Defense back in London. John Barry wrote a brilliant score. His music for the ""Capsule in Space"" was eerily ominous. He also incorporated sections of the ""James Bond Theme"" very effectively subsequent to Henderson's death and the fight in Osato's office. Barry's ""Mountains and Sunset"" went beautifully with Freddie Young's Cinematography. This and his score for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE were the last to contain his best action pieces for the series. These were little snippets here and there written to give the action a little more punch. I thought Sean Connery gave some his best performances as James Bond in this film. Bond's scene with Henderson was very good. His repartee with Moneypenney was one of his best. Sean Connery did return as James Bond in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER but one era had already ended with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and a new one would begin with his return.

When I first saw DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER I left the theatre slightly shaken and definitely stirred. That was in December 1971. I remember getting the soundtrack album for Christmas. The soundtrack album: that was about the only thing I thought was good about this film, but even that wasn't much consolation for my unsettling reaction to this Bond movie. It just didn't sit quite well with me. Something about DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER seemed very wrong. As I had sat watching the film I kept thinking why is this film going out of its way to be funny? Why were all the villains acting so hokey? It was as if I walked into a Matt Helm movie. Looking back, it was if the filmmakers were making a parody of their own series. The first six Bond films were played straight. If there was any comedy at all it was delivered in a very subtle and sophisticated manner. It was never diverting or done at the expense of the story line. It was always peripheral to the scene and meant to enhance the scene, not be the focus of it. In fact all the humor of the first six Bond films usually emanated from James Bond himself. He frequently threw off paradoxical droll commentaries to accentuate the scene at hand, but always took his job seriously and was dedicated to the bitter end of each assignment. The villains in first six Bond films always played their parts with deadly seriousness lacking any humor from within with the exception of the ""bad girls,"" Pussy Galore, Fiona Volpe and Helga Brandt. Honor Blackman, Luciana Paluzzi and Karin Dor, respectively, played their roles as the female counterpart to the mystique of Connery's Bond. They were never silly as they exuded their cool sexuality with wry aplomb. Given the right time they each would have given Bond his comeuppance without batting an eyelash. Male or female, the villains in first six Bond films were all dangerous and a threat to James Bond not to be taken lightly. The villians in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER with the exception of Joe Robinson as Peter Franks, never present any real threat. They seem to be there for the sole purpose of getting some chuckles like performers in a vaudeville act. Bruce Glover as Mister Wint and Putter Smith as Mister Kidd, Blofeld's henchmen, are not even pale shadows to Robert Shaw's Red Grant, Harold Sakata's Oddjob, Philip Locke's Vargas or Yuri Borienko's Gruenther. Blofeld's ""front man"" Burt Saxby, played by veteran actor Bruce Cabot, comes to his end in a most ridiculous scene, again just for laughs after he gives a credible performance. Other earlier ""front men"" such as Guy Doleman as Count Lippe and Teru Shimada as Osato were portrayed believably and disposed of just as believably in THUNDERBALL and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. The preeminent mouthpiece for Blofeld was Ilse Steppat as Irma Bunt in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. She ultimately and tragically murdered James Bond's bride. Blofeld's scientists also can't seem to retain credibility for the entirety of the film. Joseph Furst performance as professor Metz falls completely apart in the final act like some misguided schoolboy. David Healy as the Vandenburg Launch Director is just ludicrous. It's all just supposed to be so very funny. When you think back to DR. NO and the likes of Professor Dent (Anthony Dawson), Mr. Jones - the chauffeur from the airport (Reggie Carter), the ""freelance"" photographer for the Daily Gleaner (Margaret Le Wars), Miss Taro (Zena Marshall), Sister Rose (Michele Mok) and Sister Lily (Yvonne Shima) the odds were definitely against James Bond. In DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER the villains are a no-show. Almost every scene in this film is either played with a comic slant or is directed as pure hokum. One scene that is played straight is when Bond slaps Tiffany Case across the cheek demanding the identity of her contact after finding the body of Plenty O'Toole in the swimming pool. The fight scene in the elevator between Bond and Peter Franks is also played straightforward until Tiffany Case enters the scene. That's about it. The plot is very confusing and it really doesn't matter because the film does not take itself serious. Many Bond enthusiasts were not pleased with Charles Gray's performance as Blofeld. He was not the same Blofeld we saw, or didn't see in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, THUNDERBALL or YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. He was a bit of a dandy and infinitely much more sophisticated than Telly Savalas in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Given the tone of this film Gray's performance was on target. The continuity of the Blofeld character in this series, which showed signs of crumbling, disintegrated completely in this film. I have never understood why so many critics through the years have stated that this was Sean Connery's best performance as Bond. It looks like he had fun making it, but again he was just going through the motions and delivered a good self-parody of his previous performances of the character. John Barry's score was much more lightweight, not in substance, but in sound. He appropriately reflected the tone of the film. The string and percussion sections are much more prominent here than in earlier Bond films. Actually, it is one of his better Bond scores. It is much lighter than his previous Bond scores, but it is very rich and textured just the same and it is pure James Bond. Ken Adam's designs for the Willard Whyte penthouse and Blofeld's cavernous mud bath lair were familiar and welcome additions from the man who helped set the visual style for the series. The Whyte penthouse is actually among the best set designs from the series. It is pure Bond. This film is what changed the entire coarse of the series and was actually the vanguard for the Roger Moore's Bond and in a similar way George Lazenby and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE made way for other actors to portray James Bond all the way up to Daniel Craig and beyond.",1470873600,,12383,4.758139534883721

THUNDERBALL was about as big a Bond as Bond could get.  By the time this one was made he was an institution and Connery was getting tired of playing him, and it shows in his performance.
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is noteworthy for it's glimpse of 60s life and style in Japan, but Bond as a Japanese is ridiculous in a series that was getting more and more ridiculous.  Connery's hairpiece and waist line seem to be suffering a bit but it's only worse in...
DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER which is sort of like if your Uncle Ned played James Bond.
