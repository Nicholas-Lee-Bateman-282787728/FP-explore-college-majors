1199710,3,B00000EZSI,"The performance was not as good as I expected, especially that of Riccardo Cocciante and Helmut Lotti.  I never heard these two singers before and, if I knew how bad they are, I wouldn't have purchased this dvd.  I was surprised to find that they are both well-known after my google search of them!  Riccardo Cocciante did not seem to have a voice at all in this dvd, not sure if it had something to do with the recording or if it were the fact, though.",1230422400,,453,4.244186046511628
1199711,4,B00000EZSI,"Sarah sings ""THE FIRST OF MAY"" as only she can sing it-beautifully! The song ""Walking On The Air"" is catchy, I find myself humming it. The whole concert was a delight!",1229731200,,167,4.419354838709677
1199712,5,B00000EZSI,"Sorry, all you negative reviewers out there, but for MY money LOTTI, COCCIANTE and conductor MERCURIO present themselves as THREE COOL DUDES, along with DOMINGO and BRIGHTMAN as frosting on the (Christmas) cake! A command performance, one and all. (The kid's choir, charming in its scrubbed innocence, ain't bad either.) Buy it!",1164585600,9,328,5.326923076923077
1199713,5,B00000EZSI,This is a wonderful video - great vocals accompanied by a delightful children's choir and an absolutely sublime Vienna Philharmonic. I've watched it over and over again and I highly recommend it to lovers of  Christmas music.,962928000,12,225,5.081081081081081
1199714,5,B00000EZSI,"I thought that placido was over bearing. Sarah deserves all the credit for that preformance. She made the show much better than it would have been if it were only the other three. As for the two pop singers...Lotti has a weak  voice and the other guy .....I honestly don't know how he became a singer,  his voice is lacking, but sarah she was delightful...i always love hearing  her beautiful voice..she put me in the holiday spirit.",950832000,7,433,4.597402597402597
1199715,4,B00000EZSI,"I bought this dvd to hear Sarah Brightman. I wasn't expecting anything great, maybe a nice disc to watch at Christmas time. I've listened to it 3 times and here is what I think. The choice of music was an eclectic mix of  traditional European and modern songs which I thought worked very well. The  dvd video and audio quality were excellent. The setting was a beautiful  cathedral type structure. Brightman was great as usual. Domingo added a  distinguished older presence. Cocciante (who I had not heard before) is  very good - he has a raspy beatiful voice which filled the room. Lotti, I  wasn't that impressed with (I thought his voice was rather weak). Anyway, I  thought overall a pretty enjoyable disc. Those are my two cents. Enjoy the  video and music. Buon natale.",950832000,16,775,4.688888888888889
1199716,2,B00000EZSI,"Without mincing words, an unexpected dissapointment.  Domingo is charming as always and the aging of his voice on this disk is very distinct, although in no way unpleasant.  Brightman's performance is very credible  and the audio production values, which were very poor on my copy, seemed to  favor her more than any of the others.  Lotti, so often versatile and  acrobatic in his approach on other disks seems flat and clouded here.  Cocciante is an annoying presence on this disk and his voice does not blend  well at all with the other three...a marketing risk that did not pay off.  I can only assume that all the performers, in retrospect, would prefer that  the disk had never been released.  Had I known about the non-traditional  repertoire I might have been better prepared for the dissapointment...there  was not a single number in which I was emotionally transported.",946857600,4,878,4.931506849315069
1199717,1,B00000EZSI,Sarah Brightman was great! Placido Domingo is way past his prime and should stop soi ling his past stellar reputation; The other two are pop singers with NO VOICE; this record is an insult to opera lovers!,944438400,3,205,4.5675675675675675
1199718,2,B00000EZSI,"When I read the first reviews, I could not (did not want to) believe them. Unfortunately they were true. It is sad that these great performers could not produce a more 'festive' concert. I am glad I did not pay to see the  concert. Unfortunately, Sara, Pla...D, etal, will never see these reviews.",944006400,,297,4.60377358490566
1199719,5,B00000EZSI,"Es muy bueno, la cancion First of May Sarah la hace brillante y tambien Santa Claus is Coming to Tawn, ademas me gusto mucho la cancion Silent Night cantada en Frances, Ingles, Italiano y en Espaol.",915321600,,198,4.527777777777778

7906161,4,B00000EZSI,My wife and I love Sarah Brightman.  Every thing she has anything to do with is great.  I is a great Christmas album that we will enjoy year after year as long as our Savior permits!,1391904000,,182,4.027777777777778
7906162,4,B00000EZSI,"I've seen this done before and it usually doesn't work well. It sure doesn't work well here. The trained operatic voices are so much stronger that the pop singers that the differences between the technique and styles is heightened to the point where one doesn't enjoy both kinds of singing very much. I do enjoy a talented popular singer when I'm listening to just that style. I love opera singers, and the tremendously enriched sound those trained voices bring to anything they sing. From now on I think I'll stick to DVDs that feature only one style at a time. Everyone does as good of a job as they can do in this DVD; it's just having them sing together demonstrates the enormous differences in breathe control, vocal range, power and expressiveness.",1390348800,,754,4.71969696969697
7906163,5,B00000EZSI,"This DVD of the performances in Vienna at Christmas is a heart-warming, seasonal sensation. We will bring it out and watch it again and again, year after year, A great way to get into the spirit of Christmas!",1362787200,,208,4.5
7906164,5,B00000EZSI,"Wish I could get the complete series from Vienna, but some are no longer available. Love Placido Domingo and all.",1357084800,,113,4.7

7906166,5,B00000EZSI,"Desde que lo vi por primera vez me cautivo este concierto Navide&ntilde;o, 4 Grandes Interpretes Placido Domingo, Sara Brigthman, Helmut Lotty y Ricardo Cocciante, as&iacute; como los Coros, mucha armon&iacute;a perfecta para las fiestas.",1326672000,,238,6.029411764705882
7906167,5,B00000EZSI,"It's the best soprano in the world (Sarah Brightman) with one of the best tenors (Placido Domingo), an excellent R&B singer (Riccardo Cocciante) and a European pop star (Helmut Lotti).
Brightman blends her magnificent voice well with all three men, especially the bluesy Cocciante. Her solo version of First of May is beautiful enough to evoke tears.
There are also best-I've-ever-heard arrangements of Child in a Manger (Brightman-Cocciante), Santa Claus is Coming to Town (Brightman-Cocciante), and production numbers of Silent Night and the haunting John Lennon song Happy Christmas (War is Over).
The Viennese audience to this live concert must have come away wondering if it ever got any better.",1325203200,,700,5.372727272727273

7906169,5,B00000EZSI,Had seen some of this on TV. Bought it to have it all. Helmut Lotti's voice and boyish looks stole our hearts. Very moving performance by all.,1262822400,,142,4.296296296296297
