8010233,1,B0001CWH4O,"What might promise to be a great collection of classic short films is a total letdown, offering almost nothing rare, humorous, or insightful about sex in modern culture.  With the exception of a few great early cartoons, the balance is made up of worn pornography movie trailers, nudist travelogues, tired soft porn clips, government issued health advisory shorts, and a few sexy 60's TV commercial spots. This DVD is such a disappointing bore. With all the interesting archived material out there waiting to be used, it would have been a whole lot better job if they had bothered to take a real interest in the topic.",1253232000,,618,4.830188679245283
8010234,5,B0001CWH4O,"I'm utterly amazed at the breadth and scope of this dvd.

It's a joyously hilarious rollercoaster ride through the backroads of sexy cinema.

""The Subject is Sex""  contains an imaginative collection of

never-before-seen antique erotica,

quirky animation, classic burlesque routines and hilariously

campy clips from the silent era(with a few newly created vintage soundscores)

to the present. Eric Schaefer's historic essay puts it all into perspective

and Parr's ""Cheap Smut Give-A-Way"" is a highly creative use of

dvd interactivity. All my burlesque dancer friends love it!

I can't wait for Volume Two.

PS: Don't miss the ""Beefcakes and Cheesecakes"" montage!",1120435200,,667,5.57
8010235,1,B0001CWH4O,"THE SUBJECT IS SEX (Facets/Other Cinema) is Stephen Parr's bizarre compendium of old exploitation films, nudie shorts, peep show loops, weirdly suggestive commercials, cartoon porn, and X rated clips.  There's no narration or thematic thread other than sex and the dated weirdness of visual titillation.

These beat up, scratched, dirty (no pun intended) snippets of found film (?) are unimaginatively arranged -- really just spliced together without any hint of artistry.

It's all rather humdrum and certainly not erotic although at times very explicit.  Unrated. 100 minutes.",1107475200,6,578,5.609195402298851
