8238133,4,B0010OIP5M,"Good movie, but so true to life today.  Young women let this happen all of the time and no one interferes in their lives and tries to stop it.  Those who know or suspect whats going on in there loved one lives, should do something about it before it's too late.

A lesson learned is a life saved.
