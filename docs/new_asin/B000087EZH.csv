7979606,3,B000087EZH,"I should have looked more closely at the description but since it was so cheap, I figured I might as well buy it. But there wasn't enough information to determine which movies these were. If you like the really old Hitchcock, then this may be for you. But Murder is from 1930, and it doesn't even say a date for Sabotage. Old Hitchcock = hard to watch. So this is for the diehard fans who want a complete collection. Oh well, it didn't cost me much.",1480636800,,449,4.232558139534884
7979607,3,B000087EZH,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as FAMILY VALUE) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair. ""DIGITALLY REMASTERED"" on front cover may simply mean these were dubbed from tape.

Both films on this Hitchcock double feature are pre-Hollywood works by the Master of Suspense that enjoy wide circulation.

MOVIE MINUTIAE:

MURDER!-- Contains the first use of a person's thoughts as voiceover.
A German language version called ""Mary"" was filmed simultaneously on the same sets.

SABOTAGE-- Based on Joseph Conrad's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Agent/dp/159308305X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret Agent</a>.""
Hitch was forced to retitle this as ""Sabotage"" because his previous release was called ""Secret Agent.""

7979608,5,B000087EZH,"I bought this 2 disc set for only $1.45 when it first appeared on Amazon a couple of months ago, and for the price, it's amazing. I already owned ""Sabotage"" (1936) on the ""Alfred Hitchcock: The Legend Begins"" movie set, but I didn't own ""Murder"" (1930), and getting the movie by itself would be about $5-6 dollars, so it was a great bargain getting ""Sabotage"" along with ""Murder"" for about $4-5 dollars less. But there is one problem. On the DVD cover (different from the one it shows on Amazon), it says ""Digitally Remastered Movie"". I didn't really expect much because it was from a low-budget company that I never heard of (Leisure Entertainment), but they could have at least remastered it a little, but it seems like they didn't remaster it all. It's extremely blurry, washed out, and faded, alongs with hisses, pops, and bangs in the audio. Another thing is they said you can choose from 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and the original 2.0 Mono track, but the only difference is that the 5.1 sounds just a tad louder than the 2.0. That's the problem I have with the DVD, but it still deserves 5 stars, because both movies are early Hitchcock classics that are excellent!

  Murder is about a woman, Diana Baring (Norah Baring) who is accused of murdering somebody, and Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall) investigates. It also stars Phyllis Konstam. It's a really interesting movie, with some good suspense and the end and a courtroom sequence, but my favorite part is the point-of-view talk between Norah Baring and Herbert Marshall when he visits her in jail. It's a very-well done sequence that shows the early brilliance of Hitch. I noticed that the audio is slightly off in a few scenes, but other than that, I can't complain. It's a great film. Another thing is that instead of the cut 90-minute version, this DVD comes with uncut 104-minute version. I thought that was fantastic!

  Sabotage is about a man named Karl Verloc, that owns a cinema, who is a part of a terrorisst group that plan bombings in London. His wife, Mrs. Verloc (Sylvia Sydney) gets mixed up in it all when Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer (John Loder) walks into her life, investigating Mr. Verloc. Mrs. Verloc suddenly finds out. Desmond Tester plays her little brother, Stevie. I thought ""Sabotage"" was an amazing and suspenseful Gaumont-British Hitchcock film that deserves repeated viewings.

  Both of these films are great quality, with not so great audio/video quality, but altogether, this dual-sided DVD is worth it.",1318550400,2,2510,4.845794392523365
