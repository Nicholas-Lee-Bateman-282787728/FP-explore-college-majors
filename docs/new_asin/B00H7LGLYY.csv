8630574,4,B00H7LGLYY,I am very glad to be the first review for Camp Kickitoo on Amazon. I helped Ric Sternberg on this movie and know the love and work he put into it . I am very proud of the end product and the theme that runs thru it that the shade of your skin has a lot to do with the way you are treated.  Ric cares so much about the way people treat each other and the respect they show this amazing Universal Cruise ship. I hope you find the time to watch it. I also hope you will do everything you can to support people that not only care but are trying to do something to bring about change. Hope you enjoy it and please tell others about it.,1425945600,3,630,3.8461538461538463
8630575,4,B00H7LGLYY,"This movie is a project created by a friend of mine and so I had a compelling need to see what he had produced and directed.  What I found and saw was a delightful adventure into the complex and humor filled days and weeks designed for men and women who have come to their desire (or the desire of a judge) to 'recover' from whatever ailed them. I found Camp Kickittoo a hoot!  I know many who have ""recovered"" and I highly recommend this behind the curtain view!",1395273600,,463,4.25
