7946302,5,B00005MOHA,"I bought this video after my 2yr refused to watch Baby Santa's Music Box. I'm so glad I did! He adores this video, we watch it twice a day at least. He's learned most of the songs words and loves the trip to the candy cane factory, the making of snowangels, skiing and ice skating he loves it all! It's educational (has some counting, color recognition, object recognition etc.) and is just.. cute. This is one of those video's you won't dread watching with your child.. TRUST ME!",1102809600,,480,4.465909090909091
7946303,4,B00005MOHA,"My 14 month old loves this Christmas show.  He does get a little bored during the candy cane factory part, & then gets right back into it.  I think older kids would like that part & be bored  with some other parts.  So you can think of it lasting through more ages, or as not completely right for one age.  Unlike many kids videos, the music isn't annoying.  It's good Christmas music that I don't mind hearing while he's watching.  Has a large variety of stuff including Santa, snow play, tree decorating, etc.  Really fun show & a good change for the season from regular baby videos.",1069200000,,585,4.401869158878505
7946304,5,B00005MOHA,"Awww - this video is SO cute! It's NOT hokey or tacky - it IS full of tasteful and classic Christmas images and music. The style is very similar to Small Fry's ""Brainy Baby"" video for little ones (familiar music, simple, eye-catching images, sweet kids) but it's all about Christmas. My toddler especially loved the beautiful shots of sparkly ornaments, the child making cookies with mom, and the ""how candy-canes are made"" section. I loved the traditional shots of electric trains,playing in the snow, babies with new toys, etc. that remind me of what I love about this season. Watching this made me feel like a little kid again, and I love being able to introduce this feeling to my child, too.",999820800,3,696,4.713114754098361
