8219271,5,B000VKYN7K,"I had never seen an English or Scottish Tattoo. It is quite
extrodinary. It features the famous Massed Pipes & Drums, the
calvary bands of the British Army, the Scottish Country and Highland
Dancers (200 years of service!). Also the Barbados Defence Force
Band; there's a choral rendition of the Barbados country song that
is lovely-My Barbados. Also, believe it or not, included is the
Southeast Missouri State University Marching Band (The Golden
Eagles) and CAnada's Vancouver Police Pipe Band.  All in all I would
say that Scotland's ancestors long gone would be very happy with
these renditions.",1191628800,,600,5.122448979591836
