3719577,5,B001NLJ3RQ,"My son is a HUGE fan of Word World, and after going on a two week cruise where we watched the same two Word World DVDs over and over and over and over (you get the picture), I came home determined to buy the rest of the DVDs just so I could have some variety.  Boppin' with  the Bug Band is my favorite out of the bunch that I bought upon our return.  The songs are cute, the story lines are wonderful for shows geared at the preschool set, and so far, my husband and I enjoy the shows nearly as much as our son.

In addition to the vibrant colors, funny characters and cute songs, the Word World series was developed in cooperation with an Early Literacy program.  It definitely does its job.  My son, at 18 months, is able to identify by sight half of the letters of the alphabet.  While that is not entirely due to his obsession with Word World, most of the letters he identifies are those featured in Word World episodes.  I would recommend this series, and specifically Boppin' with the Bug Band, to any parent of preschoolers who is looking for something their children can watch that is fun AND beneficial.",1278806400,,1113,4.3173076923076925
