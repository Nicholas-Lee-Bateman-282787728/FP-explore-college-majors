8336037,1,B001QMPWJA,I'm going to keep this very short.  I'm a huge King's X fan.  I can't believe a band of this caliber would release a piece of garbage as this.  The whole video is slightly out of focus.  I could deal with that if the audio was pristine.  It is not.  It sounds like something recorded on a single track cassette machine with its own built-in mic.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on this one. IMHO :-),1302825600,,407,4.194805194805195
8336038,4,B001QMPWJA,"This is a pretty recent DVD release of a recording of a concert from their 'Gretchen goes to Nebraska' tour in the early Ninties. The quality is really pretty poor visually but you have to realise that it was years before DVD, digital recordings and originally not intended for release. As an exclusive retrospective visual document of the legendary and influential heavy rock in their early periods. The songs of course, are just amazingly outstanding and you still do get the 'feel' of the gig, in a strange realistic way, due to the loose, occassionally blury hazy camera work. Sounds outstanding, looks vintage. Great band though.",1280534400,2,634,4.990566037735849
8336039,5,B001QMPWJA,"this is a video that captures king's x at nearly the top of their creative powers.....they are touring the album ""gretchen goes to nebraska"" and they are on fire....hungry and the audience loves them.

the audio sounds fine.  great setlist.

the video is OK.....BUT, when this was released it was released with the disclaimer that it was simply a camera set up back at the sound board and not a professionally shot video.  it was a recording for the band to review their show and years later thought it would be a treat for fans to have.  so as long as you understand that then you will love the video....i'm surprised the other reviewer was critical of that aspect as it was openly known that it was not a professional video shoot.",1270080000,3,732,4.515151515151516
8336040,2,B001QMPWJA,"I just got this in the mail today and I was really excited to see it since this was about the same time I saw my first King's X concert.  Well, what a disappointment!  Musically it's great; the band was as hot as ever.  The video though was pretty crappy. If you have a high def. tv it looks the same as if you tried to watch a VHS tape.  If you've ever tried that on a high def. set you know exactly what I'm talking about.  I think it would have been alot better idea to release a live cd of the concert instead.  Again, musically it's hot, but visually: blurry and washed out.  I suppose if you drank enough you might enjoy watching it.  Unfortunately, I don't have enough beer in the frig. right now.  Oh well.",1235088000,5,714,4.079136690647482
