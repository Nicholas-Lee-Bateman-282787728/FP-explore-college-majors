1783552,5,B00006L92B,"When Elling's mother dies he is sent to an institution where he becomes roommates with the delayed virgin Kjell Bjarne, who is mesmerized by women.  At the institution Elling is telling Kjell stories about his ""escapades"" in the Carribean and other exotic places and they eventually become good friends.  Two years later, these two 40 year olds are sent to Oslo where they meet Frank sli, their social worker, who is going to check up on them and see if they are capable of living a normal life.  However, Elling suffers from severe xenophobia and gets anxiety attacks from the sounds of the telephone.  When Frank notices that they do not answer the phone when he calls, he gets annoyed and begins to force Elling to answer the phone in his presence when no one is calling.  This is a huge task for Elling, but also a beginning for a new life for the two of them.  Elling was nominated for an Oscar in 2002 for Best Foreign Language Film and has received many other awards.  However, what makes the film shine is the brilliant acting as well as the humane story.  In the end, the audience is left with a very warm and sensitive comedy that will cause laughter, tears, and pondering in a most inspirational manner.",1043884800,,1214,4.536697247706422
1783553,5,B00006L92B,Very sweet funny film about two Norwegian men who are released from a mental institution and learn to make lives for themselves in state subsidized housing.  Good characters and a gentle spirit make for comforting and fulfilling viewing.,1041292800,,237,5.2368421052631575
1783554,5,B00006L92B,"There are many reviews about this film out there--what you want to know is if it is worth your time. I enjoy foreign films, character development, tight plots, and non-formulaic pieces. If you enjoy unusual films that employ mental humor and explore human frailties then this is a great bet for you. If you like films where lots of stuff has to happen at a fast past then don't bother. This is not a movie for people with short attention spans, ADD, too much caffeine in their systems, or overly judgmental attitudes. This isn't for the person who likes action, explosions, pointless sex, etc. in their movies. This film is very engaging and somewhat like reading a portion of a good book. In fact it is based on book 3 in a series of 4 novels (by Ingvar Ambjrnsen). This movie is well worth your time and I could see it over and over again. It is so funny that I laughed out loud at least every 5-10 minutes. It is a wonderful portrait of two uniquely eccentric men that softly illuminates the potential growth of the human spirit. I felt great after seeing it!",1039996800,2,1062,4.4512820512820515
1783555,4,B00006L92B,"The film ""Elling"" is in many ways a riff on themes we're (all too) familiar with in the American cinema: mental impairment (Forest Gump, Rainman, One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest, etc.), friendship between two men, the role of the social welfare system in the lives of citizens.
The film also seems to include some tropes that have been circulating in recent films: the unwitting friendship between Elling and the (unbeknownst to him) famous poet calls to mind the plot of the Australian film ""The Castle"" where Mr. Kerrigan is befriended by a famous Constitutional lawyer.
Despite the familiarity of the thematic content, the film explores life in ways that the American cinema doesn't seem all that interested in at present: how the welfare state can actually help people, how artistic expression without personal recognition can be rewarding (no one can acknowledge Elling as ""E,"" the sauerkraut poet), how a frienship can grow/expand when a romantic relationship is introduced for one of the original pair (the American cinema seems dogmatically intent on coupling without extraneous characters).
All around, a very enjoyable film that raises some questions about the differences between Scandinavian and American social and political culture that we would be well served to consider.",1027728000,6,1285,5.273170731707317
1783556,5,B00006L92B,"There's nothing with which to compare this film.  The Odd Couple?  Perhaps, but I can't remember ever caring about Oscar and Felix as much as I cared about Elling and Kjell Bjarne.  The entire audience was rooting for them, and the heartwarming ending made my eyes sting with tears of real emotion.  I challenge anyone not to feel the same.
In spite of lukewarm reception by American critics, Elling is bound to be an audience pleaser.  It's full of the knee-slapping variety of funny while simultaneously featuring many moments that pull at the heartstrings.  The story follows 2 men as they venture from the safe confines of a mental institution in rural Norway.  Elling (the serious, dramatic character) longs only for a basic grasp on the world around him; Kjell Bjarne, the hulking, comedic character, wants something far more basic (though not necessarily easier to come by).  Their affection for each other, oddly enough is not the least bit hard to believe.  That fact stands as proof that the writing is superb.
I can't recommend this film any more heartily.  It will please the masses--the serious set will be happy to see a foreign film; those looking for comedy will not be disappointed.",1027382400,10,1199,4.862068965517241
1783557,5,B00006L92B,"This film should have won the academy award for best foreign film! It is wonderfully well-acted--the characters come alive and you care about all of them.  There were a couple of inside jokes using names of Norwegians/current events that we didn't get--not living in Norway--but other than that, the themes of the film are universal--love, friendship and concern for others can help overcome our own fears and uncertainties in life.  It was also wonderful to listen to the lovely, lilting Norwegian language, as I hadn't heard it spoken since my great grandmother lived with us many years ago.

1783559,5,B00006L92B,"I'm seldom in the market for a Norweigian-language movie, but I picked this up on a friend's recommendation.

Glad I did.  This is a quirky, offbeat, strange, but ultimately charming movie.  When you first meet these characters, you're not quite sure what to make of them -- or why you should like them.  But by the end of the movie, sure enough, you do.

It's got plenty to make you laugh, but I don't know if I'd call it a comedy.  It's got plenty of pathos, but I don't know if I'd call it a drama.  I guess I'll just call it a ""slice of life"" movie... the trials and tribulations of a couple of guys trying to make it in a world they're not fully equipped to live in.",1452384000,2,671,4.115384615384615

They are to share an apartment in the middle of the city under the watchful eye of a social worker.  They are the complete opposite of each other in every way you can imagine.

Somehow, they both get what they want in totally outrageously hilarious ways.  It's got subtitles, but I wouldn't let that stop you.  I've watched this film many times and it's always a treat.

1783575,5,B00006L92B,"Even if you're a cynical filmgoer jaded by ""uplifting/inspirational"" films, this subtitled Norwegian production offers a rather special touch and appeal.  For one thing, saccharine sweetness is avoided. Rather, we have a neurotic Mr. Peepers type and a lovable ""human orangutan"" struggling to adapt to independent living in an urbane Scandinavian capital.  Has sort of a ""Cuckoo's Nest"" feel.  Highly recommended for an enjoyable and insightful viewing experience.",1383004800,,464,5.794117647058823

1783580,4,B00006L92B,"Steven Holden, in his New York Times review of ""Elling"", said he enjoyed the film, but that perhaps it was ""too cute by half.""  I wouldn't disagree, it is a bit overcute.  But it's also quite entertaining, sometimes poignant, and sometimes smart.  Scandinavian comedies all seem to share a certain droll quality that I like.",1361145600,,324,4.8545454545454545
1783581,2,B00006L92B,Sorry but this movie was not my style. The acting was decent but the storyline was just something I personally did not like.

I had no idea of what to expect and it turned out to be the most delightful movie I've seen in years.  Nothing compares to it, the film is so original and well acted and totally unpredictable it takes you by surprise. I simply loved it and the best part was that nothing bad happened during the entire story.  I'm used to films starting out great but at some point there's always evil lurking around the corner.  This film was a breath of fresh air and reminds one of the good in everybody.",1350864000,,582,4.263636363636364

You know how the mundane things in life and people's foibles can be just plain funny.  Like the first time that I had to go to the store and buy tampons, it was like I was planning a bank robbery! (When are the least amount of people in the store; what if there isn't a female checkout clerk; what else should I buy at the same time to make it look like a completely casual purchase)

Anyway, that's one element of the movie that I really liked.",1350172800,,586,3.9491525423728815

I got so attached to the characters of Elling and Kjell Bjarne and how their unlikely friendship grows. The humor is sometimes quite subtle and it takes a bit for it to grow, but the ending feels triumphant and joyful. Prepare to watch it several times :-) This is the 2nd Norwegian film I've seen, the first being ""Troll Hunter"" (worth a watch too if for very different reasons: hilarious, yes, but very dark too) which is a mockumentary similar to Blair Witch. Highly recommend both these movies, but Elling is the one I bought after renting and have watched over and over again. Wonderful story. It is the one that will stay with you :-)",1349481600,2,725,4.5

Elling is the ""Felix"" of the pair, with his constant companions, ""dizziness"" and ""anxiety"".  This is a quirky, touching, and delightful gem that's easy to get into and easy enough to follow.

My only complaint is that some of the less-important dialogue is not subtitled; similarly, I had the feeling that some of even the main dialogue was truncated.  I suspect the film is even more charming in its native tongue.",1347148800,,520,4.808988764044944
1783589,5,B00006L92B,"This is a sweet, touching and very funny story of two men who learn, somewhat late in life, about the simple joys of living.

We meet Elling shortly after his mother's death, a middle aged man being removed by the police from the wardrobe where he has hidden himself. Agoraphobic and unable to face life without her...""Mama handled practical matters,"" he says. ""I was more into ideology.""  Once extricated, Elling is taken to a mental hospital.  There he shares a room with Kjell Bjarne, the orangutang, as Elling calls him. Kjell is a 40-year-old virgin, a lummox, obsessed with food and sex, and given to banging his head on whatever is handy when life confuses him. Which is always.  Both men have much in common, one being the victim of a uncaring alcoholic mother, the other the victim of one who was altogether too caring.

After two years, the Norwegian social welfare system determines they are ready for recycling back into society. Elling and Kjell are given a social worker and an apartment and told to fend for themselves. They learn to cope with frightening ordeals like grocery shopping and answering the phone, and discover new joys, like phone sex, and new sorrows, like the high cost of phone sex.  They bicker, Kjell pounds his head, and baby step by baby step, they make their way in the world.

The film never patronizes Elling or Kjell Bjarne. This is not an inane feel good movie. It's more comparable to ""Of Mice and Men,"" but with Lennie and Lennie, no George.  Excellent dialogue (the subtitle captioning is very good), sharp editing and sophisticated cinematography give the film a brisk pace and keep things moving forward. The humor ranges from sly and subversive to laugh out loud.

There certainly is no lack of warmth and emotion, but we never approach pathos. You really want these fellows to make it and to fullfill their ambitions, which in Kjell's case means finding a woman, and in Elling's...okay, this one is a little tough to explain. Poetry, pop culture and packaged sauerkraut are involved. But a dream is a dream and who are we to judge.  Their fragility makes every success, whether it's ordering a meal in a restaurant or making a friend, a milestone. Both characters are so likable and so vulnerable -- and so believable -- you can't help but root for them as they becoming part of the world. Despite the films lack of sentimentality, there are lump in the throat moments.

""Elling"" received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001. One of the best films I've seen in a long time, worth every single star and worth watching a second time. After seeing this and ""Lilyhammer,"" the excellent cable tv series produced in Norway by Steven Van Zandt, I'm eager to see what other gems are coming out of the Norwegian Wood.",1346025600,3,2787,4.725773195876289

And to be honest, through this movie I realized how much Norwegian I understand

Good movies can come from anywhere and this Norwegian export is example A-1.  It surely deserved its 2002 Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.

Co-leads Per Christian Ellefsen (as the title character) and Sven Nordin (as Kjell Bjarne) are long-time veterans of Oslo's New Theatre.  To discover that these two are long-time friends and collaborators (a 20-year relationship at the time of the film) is not a surprise: their interactions on the screen are so life-like - filled with spontaneity, mood changes and subtle shifts that make up real relationships.  Ostensibly playing 'simple' characters, their talents manifest themselves in the way they slowly reveal the depth and hidden reserves of Elling and Kjell Bjarne.

The movie also benefits from the regal presence of Per Christensen, portraying writer Alfons Jrgensen.  Elling stumbles into a friendship with him.  Ellefsen's portrayal of frenzied excitement at making his 'first real friend' is one of the movie's best moments, as is his initial fit of pique when Kjell Bjarne forms his own bonds with Jrgensen.  That Elling connects over poetry and Kjell Bjarne over old American cars and a chance to rehab Jrgensen's 50s-era Buick speaks to the subtle nature of a winning script and understated direction by Petter Nss.",1295654400,,1645,5.654471544715447
1783598,5,B00006L92B,"In Norway we have this classic phrase: ""Good, for a norwegian movie"". This can be said about many norwegian movies, but not ""Elling"". ""Elling"" is a great movie no matter who you are or where you're from. The ""odd-couple""-genre is almost the only film-genre that works great regardless of nationality, and ""Elling"" is no exception. This movie is about two ""troubled"" middle-aged men: Elling & Kjell-Bjarne. They are both virgins and one of them (Elling) has been living with his mother his entire life (until her death), and thus is the more ""academic"" of the two (Kjell-Bjarne is the complete opposite). The norwegian government has decided that these two weirdos are ripe for moving from the mental institution they have been living the past few years, to an apartment at ""Majorstua"" right in the middle of the norwegian capital, Oslo(!) This is the beginning of a great and challenging adventure for Elling & Kjell-Bjarne. A totally charming and funny movie. Maybe I'm biased because I'm norwegian (I even walk by ""Majorstua"" almost every day), but I think you will enjoy it no matter where you are from. Even the soundtrack is great.

I only wish there was an ENGLISH version as many can not read the subtitles because of the  size of the letters or the speed at which  they have to read.  It is a shame that so many cannot enjoy it  as I do.  Every one who could manage the subs enjoyed it greatly.  I continue to share it with everyone I can!!,1282521600,,424,3.75

The casting for Elling, along with the acting and concept are brilliant.  It is rare when so many oddball moments are packed into one film, but this sure has its fill.  The pace moves along well.

Th premise of this entertaining and very humorous film is for two quirky roommates are released from an institution to now forge for themselves with help of government funding.  Elling (Per Christian Ellefsen)  is a 40ish anxiety filled mama's boy.  He clearly lived under his mother's thumb, never doing anything on his own.  Then, she dies and he is sent away to the institution where he meets Kjell Bjarne (Sven Nordin) who is sex-obsessed and rather a simpleton of a big guy.

It is from here with the help of social worker Frank Asli to guide and teach them a few things on life outside the institution.  Elling is fearful of stepping into the world including using a phone.  Kjell has experience with a phone sex business.  The film is filled with so many escapades, it comprises of so many emotional moments, mainly being very funny.  What we learn as the film goes along is that the men clearly have talent in their own right.

I have to reveal a most funny segment is when Kjell intends to have sex with the pregnant girl, but his state of cleanliness poses him to question.  Kjell asks Elling if he could borrow his underwear.  The underwear is removed, exchanges hands and Sven washes up in the lake and all is well!

1783605,5,B00006L92B,"Elling is an outstanding motion picture that showcases mentally ill persons as human beings with so much more to them than just their emotional problems. We get excellent portrayals of two mentally ill people thanks to a script and great acting that develop these characters with clarity, compassion and realism. The film doesn't pull any punches about mental illness; but it doesn't show that people have to be confined to their chains, either--and that's grand. The cinematography and the choreography work very well; and the acting is extremely convincing. The plot moves along at an excellent pace; I was never once bored.

When the action starts, we quickly meet two men undergoing rehab in a mental institution: Elling (Per Christian Ellefsen) and Kjell Bjarne (Sven Nordin). They share a room at the rehab center and they get along so well that when they are released the state decides to get them supervised housing as roommates once again. Of course, going out into the real world, even with the help of their new social worker Frank (Jrgen Langhelle) scares them; but we see that they are willing to at least give it a try.

At first giving it a try is a tough uphill battle in and of itself even though in their hearts they want to succeed. Going to the supermarket and answering the telephone create a huge amount of stress, especially for the shy and sensitive Elling. Kjell has his own emotional baggage; in particular he's obsessed with finding a girlfriend because he's never been alone with a woman. Kjell is remarkably shy around women; he never knows what to say.

Things gradually begin to change. Elling gradually confronts his fears about going out of their apartment, especially after his first attempts fail and social worker Frank begins to threaten to kick them out of the apartment and send them both back to the hospital if they don't confront their fears. Elling eventually goes to a poetry meeting and decides to become an emerging mysterious poet; and Kjell falls in love with a pregnant woman who lives in their apartment building. The woman, Reidun Nordsletten (Marit Pia Jacobsen), begins to fall for Kjell, too; and she invites him over for dinner.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. As time goes by, Elling makes a new friend named Alfons Jrgensen (Per Christensen). Alfons helps Elling come out of his shell and encourages Elling to write more poetry after reading some of Elling's work. Meanwhile, Kjell drifts in his own direction as he becomes increasingly involved with Reidun. This could threaten the friendship between Elling and Kjell; how will they handle that? How might Reidun react if she finds out that Kjell is recently released from an institution--will she dump him or not? And what about Elling and his poetry work--will Elling turn his back on Kjell and focus on his new profession? Watch and find out!

The DVD would have been a bit nicer if there had been a bonus featurette; all we get is ""scene selection"" and three trailers for other films. However, the film is so well done this actually becomes a minor complaint.

Elling will move you and even educate some people about what the mentally ill can accomplish despite their problems. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; people interested in human dramas and psychology would do well to get this film on DVD.",1240617600,,3360,4.814558058925477
1783606,5,B00006L92B,"I doubt many North Americans know about this Norwegian film, and that's a shame, if true.  I've watched it three times and been very entertained by it. One warning for those inspired to check this out: the first half hour can be a bit boring, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a very funny, charming film.

The story centers around two guys who are released out of a state mental hospital and given an apartment to live in (with a probation-type officer keeping tabs on how they're adjusting.) At first, it's tough as they guys are kind of clueless on how to do things on their own, particularly ""mama's boy"" Elling who is even afraid to use a telephone. His roommate is a big oaf whose main concern in life is to have sex with a woman.

In time, these guys learn nicely how to adjust. Even better, they make a friend or two and help those people with their problems. That's where the charm of the film comes in. Most of the humor is provided by ""Elling,"" who narrates the film with some wonderful dry humor. At first, his whining gets annoying but after he calms down in his new surroundings, he's fun. His roommate winds up as a straight man for his jokes. The roommate, ""Kjell Bjarne,"" is a big help to everyone including a pregnant, abandoned lady. He's an oaf, but one with a big heart.

This is really different and nice story. It's not for kids with a dozen or so s and f- words, but kids wouldn't like this film anyway. The movie will leave the rest of you with a smile on your face.",1234137600,,1503,4.30035335689046

This one is very good and we catch on quickly that it is a comedy.  The initial conversation between two new roommates in a mental hospital tells us that we are going to enjoy following these characters.  The film's possibilities expand when the two roommates are moved to a subsidized apartment in Oslo.  They have a fairly streetwise social worker who looks after them from time to time but Elling and his roommate are pretty much on their own.  The paranoia and inappropriate conversations all create a wide range of comic situations.  However, the real source of comic endearment is that these two characters are the Norwegian version of Felix and Oscar from ""The Odd Couple"".  They are exact opposites having to live together yet befriending each other in a way that give the comedy a happy and endearing tone.

These two men had spent two years together in a mental institution, sleeping in dorm-like rooms.  When they are released and housed together in a welfare apartment (A very NICE welfare apartment!) both men continue to share a bedroom because they have never been left alone.  They spend their time together talking about how to conquer the outside world.

At first the audience worries about Elling, the older man, the ""Mama's Boy"" because his life prior to being institutionalized was all about his mother.  He didn't dare venture outside; he was quite content spending his time in his apartment and reading his books.

His roommate, a Prince Valliant sort of younger man who seems to have an aversion to showering and keeping clean, has his own issues to deal with.  He ventures outside but in the persuit of food.  He does very little talking.

So as these two slowly make it outside, we are left wondering who of the two will be the first to make it big, and the surprise is quite ironic.  By meeting others around them, these two men realize that they aren't really all that crazy afterall.  Everyone around them has issues.

The scenery of the Norwegian countryside, the city shots of Oslo and the overall quick dialogue of these two odd balls make for a wonderful 90 minutes of vicarious travel to a country I've never been. The soundtrack was also quite beautiful.",1177200000,5,1502,4.690839694656488

Elling and Kjell Barne are, essentially, 2 nice guys whom don't fit into the categories of ""normalcy"" which are arbitrarily foisted upon the world. Elling is as meek as it gets. Or is he? He doesn't understand the world, thus he's turned inward. Kjell is more of a displaced anger sort of guy. He doesn't understand the world either, but his inner world is not so rich as Elling's.

I rented this and another movie at the same time. The other did zero for me. Being a 3-hour movie, and having not stirred me into caring by the 2-hour mark, I took it out. In went Elling, and for the next hour-and-a-half I was loving my cinematic experience. Essentially a comedy, this movie is still brimming with heart. I love these characters.

The simple act of answering the telephone or leaving the house leaves Elling and his giant oaf-like virgin roommate Kjell Bjarne terrified. Therefore when this duo takes even babysteps the results are often heartwarming and funny. You revel in their small triumphs.

Just because there are laughs and uncomfortable moments that are funny does NOT make this a comedy, this is rather a film study of two disparate characters who truly have a relationship for each other, and, OK now hold on to your horses, it's NOT a gay relationship. Trust me that is a marvel in itself since if this film were made in the USA, for sure the director could not avoid the temptation of injecting that stupidity into the film.

Seems like all the movies of today on this side of the ocean can't have two men having any kind of relationship unless it's gay! I have been so CONDITIONED now to this that I actually waited for the whole movie to end before I realized what a wonderfull non gay movie it was.

In this film both young men are released into the community after spending four years or so rooming together at a mental institution. Elling has agrophobia giving him a total panic fear of leaving his own room never mind his apartment and his roomate is a bumbling quiet gentle giant that rarely speaks and is basically obsesses with sex and food. Both of them are moved by the state into a two bedroom apartment in Oslo in preparation for them to integrate back into society. Their individual struggles with their obsessions as they try to develop relationships outside of their circle of two are incredibly filmed, and the viewer is treated to what I believe is the main theme of this film, the incredibly deep and strong love and affection that the two of them have for each other as they just try to make it trough the day.

1783629,5,B00006L92B,"""Elling"" is the first film I've ever seen that transcends the popular film industry stereotypes and portrays people with mental illness as fully functioning three dimensional people, with both emotional and intellectual motivations as characters in a film. The prevailing ""Hollywood"" characterizations of mental illness seems to use three templates to portray mentally ill characters: 1) the over-the-top violent sociopath who is a dangerous predatory beast i.e...Hannibal the Cannibal; 2) the unstable visionary savant who can hardly function but is either intellectually brilliant or has or possesses some sort of supernatural power to compensate i.e...Russell Crowe in ""Beautiful Mind"" or Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"". or, 3) the loveable, laughable, whacky lunatic who can't fit into society and is a walking time-bomb  i.e...Jack Nicholson in ""Cuckoo's Nest.""
This adaptation of Norwegian writer Ingvar Ambjorsen's best selling novel is a nuanced view of the lives of two mentally ill wards of the state as they struggle to adapt to living as roommates; and they try to make sense of often puzzling and arbitrary codes of  ""normal"" social behavior. At times it is hilarious, but just as Director Peter Naess lures you into a warm and fuzzy feeling, he gives you a glimpse at the simmering rage of his main characters Elling and Kjell. Having worked as a case worker for transitional mental health patients, I can say that ""Elling"" is the only film I've ever seen that ""gets it right"" and doesn't approach the subject of mental illness in a condescending or derivative manner. Elling and Kjell aren't lovable loonies or dangerous whackos from central casting.  There is a great deal of humor in ""Elling"" but none of it is used to demean or stereotype the principal characters.  When a young punk poet, in bondage gear and Kiss whiteface screams his menacing poetry at a coffee house, it causes an anxiety attack for Elling...but it also begs the question, ""Who's the crazy one, here?.""
The brilliance of  ""Elling"",however is the two actors who play Elling and Kjell. Per Christian Ellefsen (as Elling) is a fascinating and gentle soul in a constant struggle to keep his obsessions, agoraphobia and anti-social tendencies from consuming him. His sense of equilibrium is threatened by a trip to the grocery store or even picking up the phone and talking.  On the other hand, Sven Nordin (as Kjell) is a hulking and affable man (think Gerard Depardieu) who is prone to wild mood swings that lead to socially inappropriate behavior. Kjell's innocence leads him to unwittingly make remarks to women which are regarded as inappropriate in polite society. Kjell is more than capable of a loving , caring sexual relationship but doesn't have the social skills to establish rapport with a female.
 As the film progress the two roommates are slowly transformed into fully functional people, albeit, people who still have a lot of problems, but now have the tools to adapt to the perplexing world of social norms.  Elling's friendship with elderly bohemian intellectual who shares his passion for poetry provides him with self confidence in his own tentative attempt to write poetry.  Kjell's friendship as an informal caretaker for an upstairs neighbor develops into a romantic relationship, as the her pregnancy from a prior lover progresses. Kjell realizes he loves the woman and will help her care for the child as if the child was his own flesh and blood.  Both Elling and Kjell anchor each other's erratic behaviors in ways that the viewer never anticipates, and they are often stunned by thier own abilty to say the right thing at the right time, to keep their roommate from spinning out of control. It's a inspiring form of peer therapy.
It is the intriguing and often quirky relationship between our two roommates, Elling and Kjell, that brings the magic to this film. Per Christian and Sven played the principal roles in the stage play of ""Elling""; so if you sense that they bring a sense familiar comfort to their acting chemistry, it's because they've shared the stage for hundreds  of performances as Elling and Kjell. This movie production of Elling was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001, and is shot entirely in Oslo Norway which is a captivating and under used European film location.",1085270400,44,4328,5.0476190476190474

I hope that people in Norway are really this nice and that they really do care for their their indigent and psychiatric population like in this movie.  As far as the movie, I was most impress with the two lead actors.  They played their characters to a perfect pitch.  Their isn't much to the plot, no antagonist, no spine tingling  conflict or surypy hollywood resolution.  It's just about people trying their best to live a normal life the way they know how.  I also liked the soundtrack, I wonder where I can find the CD?  You gotta love this movie.  Makes you feel good.",1076544000,7,940,4.464705882352941
1783632,5,B00006L92B,"Elling (Per Christian Ellefsen) and Kjell (Sven Nordin) are roommates in a Norwegian institution, and as the film begins they are being released and given an apartment in Oslo, under the supervision of a social worker, to see whether or not they can survive and thrive on their own. The film takes us through their painful first weeks, when Kjell is driven by sexual frustration and Elling fears leaving the apartment or even answering the telephone, and continues as they develop competence, confidence and even friendships. This is a touching story but is not told as an inspirational or overly sentimental tale; instead it is very human and often quite funny, with a terrific script by Madeleine Fant.

I really enjoyed these two characters as well as those they meet throughout the film, which was nominated for a foreign film Oscar, deservedly so. Director Petter Naess has done a fine job.

The dvd contains no language or subtitle options.  Extras are minimal -- three trailers.",1075075200,8,985,4.957575757575758
1783633,5,B00006L92B,"Super, super, super.
Two guys in Oslo, terminally mismatched, pair up in a home for mentally disturbed adults. One is huge and maybe a little stupid and full of rage. The other is a bright but wounded and sheltered momma's boy - but then Momma died. After years of therapy (it's not clear how long they're institutionalized), they're released to try to make it on their own, with occasional checkups from a halfway-house sort of social worker who tries to help ease their transition back into society.
Watching these two fellows cope with a ringing phone, feeding themselves, the big bad world outside their apartment, traffic, a pregnant neighbor, and an old poet with a broken car is heartwarming, a little sad at times - but always you find yourself rooting for them to find happiness.
Their small triumphs, larger setbacks, and overall progress make for a touching, unbeat, and absolutely hilarious movie.",1054684800,15,909,4.947712418300654
1783634,5,B00006L92B,"Elling is a funny and at times touching film set in Oslo, Norway. It follows the lives of two friends Elling and Kjell Bjarne as they try to adjust to a normal life after having spent two years together in a mental institution as roomies. Elling and Kjell Bjarne are so unalike Elling is the knowledgably, sophisticated and weedy looking one and while Kjell Bjarne is more of a brute prone to angry outbursts.  Elling is interested in poetry while Kjell Bjarne is more interested in sex.  They are given an opportunity to show that they can cope on their own when the state decides to give them an apartment and a social worker (Frank).  In the beginning even the simplest things like shopping or answering the phone are obstacles they must learn to overcome.
There are some serious moments but on the whole the film is very upbeat. You find yourself rooting for Elling and Kjell Bjarne hoping that the friendship they have built doesn't come tumbling down as they each make new friends and are drawn in differing directions.  It's a touching movie with laughs and a few tugged heartstrings. There is a moment at the end of the movie that has you more than hoping for an upbeat ending.
Don't let the fact that Elling a foreign film put you off.  The film still gives you the full gambit of emotions without you having to understand a word of Norwegian. The film comes with easy to read subtitles and a story line that's easy to follow.",1046044800,61,1435,4.525096525096525
1783635,4,B00006L92B,"I thought this movie was wonderful.  I love the ""odd couple"" friendship Kjell and Elling have.  I think the dialog is beautifully written - it truly felt like a novel that came to life.  (I later discovered that Elling was actually based on the Norwegian novel).  There are some really great lines here, I want to list my favorites.. but I think it would be more enjoyable if you heard them in the movie before reading them here.
You'll laugh out loud (and silently) and sympathize wholeheartedly with Elling.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who can read. (the movie is in subtitles).
The only reason I gave this 4/5stars is that I thought the ending felt a little lingering.  If there was a 4.5 I could give, it would have gotten that score.",1045958400,4,750,4.518518518518518

not that this movie has any relation to star wars; far from it.
Elling is an amazing movie.  the characters suck you into their world...I've never actually seen this movie in english, but I would recommend it to anyone, everyone, anywhere.

1783637,5,B00006L92B,I picked this movie up on a whim at Blockbuster and have to say it is one of the best foreign films of 2002. The director and the actors do a great job of pulling you in and really caring and loving these nutty guys. To watch these two men who couldn't have been more opposite grow to love each other and need each other can teached us all a lesson not only in human nature but I think it has help me to become more sympathetic to those with mental disease. This movie will make you howl and it will make you cry with joy over the love these two guys have for each other.,1045180800,3,571,3.9310344827586206
