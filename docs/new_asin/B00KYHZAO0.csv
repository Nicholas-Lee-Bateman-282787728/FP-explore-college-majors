8662602,4,B00KYHZAO0,"Emergency couple is a really fun and addicting drama! I would've never imagined I would enjoy it as much as I did. I've never liked medical tv-series, so when I first heard about this drama I had no intention on watching it. But because I was bored and was scrolling trough tumblr, I read a post that convinced me to watch it.

Kim Tan's brother from Heirs and Running Man's Ace together in the same drama?
I just couldn't say no.

I believe 15 or 16 episodes were already out by the time I started this drama and I kid you not, I raced through the whole thing and watched it all in two days! Yep, I just couldn't control myself.

So basically this is about a divorced couple, who meets again after 6 years and ends up working in the same Emergency room as interns.
As they work hard and save people's lives, they try to leave their past behind them and awkwardly hide their divorced relationship to their collegues.

Oh Chan Min (Choi Jin Hyuk) and Oh Jin Hee (Song Ji Hyo) were really young and immature when they got married, and if they were a bit more responsable, they would have had less misunderstandings and would have been able to save their marriage. However, they were completely caught up with their own feelings that they ignored how the other one felt.
I really loved watching their reactions when they meet again; they keep saying that now that they're divorced, they have nothing to do with each other, but it's obvious that their relationship isn't over yet.
I like the love triangle  and the other characters, they add lots of fun to this drama. When Gary made a cameo, I just couldn't stop from laughing, that was totally unexpected.

This drama deals with several issues like family, marriage and divorce. It studies the choices that people make in their lives, the real meaning of love and how hard it is to give second chances. It's full of depth and meaning but even though it approaches serious topics, every episode is well balanced with lots of funny and awkward moments.

Although I really had fun watching this drama, I thought they dragged out the story a little bit, so I didn't really like the ending.",1405555200,,2133,4.510362694300518
