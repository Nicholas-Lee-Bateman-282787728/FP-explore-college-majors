627466,4,6303336205,"the subject is of the sort that has become cynically debased on tawdry daytime chatshows - the 'world's first serial killer' is turned in by her lover, adopted by a fervant Christian, persuaded to file a no-contest plea - but the treatment is an accumulatively scathing look at the US justice and legal system, the police and the media.
Like most 'post-modern' documentary makers, Nick Broomfield doesn't pretend that he is a distant observer - he puts himself and his equipment in the picture; and, in one way, the process of making the documentary IS the documentary: the financial wrangles with Aileen's self-appointed guardians; the inability to get an interview with the police etc.
Among the shocking things that emerge include: an (alleged) deal between the police and Aileen's lover to profit on movie deals; the persuading of Aileen by her adoptive mother and her lawyer to confess so as to increase her marketability as a serial killer, despite Aileen's (not unjustified) claims that the killings were in self-defence.  this 'self-reflexivity' doesn't try to modishly undermine the documentary form - it gives the viewer a heightened awareness of the media, the way it tries to manipulate stories for various interests.  When we finally get to meet Aileen - having seen her filtered through others' so-called personal testomonies, news reports, hearsay, speculation, official videos of statements, confessions and trials - the impact is winding.
Rather than unveiling the 'truth', Broomfield, like Errol Morris in the similar 'The thin blue line', succeeds in casting doubt on received and official truths.  This is also one of the best films about US 'trash' culture; or, more precisely, a culture that turns all humanity to trash.  The fact that this all takes place in Florida gives the film a contemporary resonance, especially the nauseating, 'Rebecca'-like scene, where an state execution is described in all its technical chill, a ghostly premonition of future horrors.",1001635200,9,1986,5.235849056603773
627467,5,6303336205,"This excellent 1992 British documentary by Nick Broomfield about ""America's first female serial killer"" poses more questions than it answers which is indicative of the quagmire of duplicity that surrounded the case. Aileen was a prostitute convicted of the shooting murder of 7 men in central Florida between 1989 and 1990 and sentenced to death by electric chair. She is a tragic figure since she appeared to be surrounded by people who wanted to see her die and profit from their association with her. Her lesbian lover helped her be arrested, her adopted stepmother convinced her to plead guilty, her lawyer more excited about his rock career, the police more interested in the movie rights, state politicians who needed her dead to be re-elected. When we finally get to meet Aileen in prison we see what an intelligent and open person she appears to be, which deepens the tragedy, though we never learn her fate. Broomfield spends a lot of time on camera with Aileen's stepmother and lawyer, filming their negotiated contracts, and travelling the area trying to unravel the story, though ultimately failing. Aileen claims that the killings were all acts of self-defense, an opinion we tend to believe when we hear her horrific evidence in a filmed trial. The most fascinating person is the one we never meet - the vanished ex-lover whom Aileen is willing to die to protect and who seems to hold the key to the truth.",997142400,36,1420,4.871900826446281
627468,2,6303336205,"i had heard great things about this one.  mr bromfield apparantly did not have enough good footage to make up a complete documentary and the result here feels terribly padded (ie. the interview with a man who says he didn't  know ms wurnos much at all.  so what is he going to contribute to the film,  dare i ask?)  though the characters of the adoptive mother and expecially  the loony lawyer are interesing, the whole film feels very off center.  so  much time is wasted on conversations about how much to pay whom , and  trying to get an interview to be turned down, that the film is more about  trying to make a film than about aileen or the people using her for their  own gain.  the narration is unnecessary and extremely annoying, either  pointing out the obvious (""but he locked the door..."") or  covering up the interview. two far better documentaries (both made by  berlinger and sinofsky) are 'brothers keeper' and 'paradise lost'. both  expore media influence on the justice system and are far more engaging,  moving, meaningful, and insightful.",933897600,2,1057,4.71978021978022
627586,4,6303336205,"It shows the sleazy life of a young woman who is on the bottom of society. Im crazy Lee tells her girlfriends sister. Her squandering of money shows a personal problem, so too her anger. Lee looks at her mementos. She is angry with people all of the time. [A personality type to avoid.] We see another example of her work. The police note similarities to another murder. Later we see a truck stop and its activity. Later Lee meets another man, later the police find another body shot with a .22 pistol. Overkill. All were white men from age 40 to 65, their cars stolen. The police suggest a serial killer. The FBI profiler suggested a young white male. Can the police agencies cooperate? There is distrust of FBI involvement.

One detective suggests a woman did it (most serial murderers are men). At home Lee has a nightmare. The police find blond hair in two cars, and note the seat position. TV news tells about the murders and the suspect. Later Lee finds her girlfriend has left her. The police get a tip, investigate, and locate the motel. Its Christmas time, Lee remembers her past as a young teenager. A thumb print brings up Aileen Wuornos records for the police. The police visit Ohio to learn about Tyra Moore, who learns about Aileens past. The police narrow their search to a few locations. Two undercover policemen locate Aileen in a bar. She dances by herself. The police need the gun to tie her to the murders, and her girlfriend. But she can slip away. They will arrest her on an old warrant and pretend they know nothing more. She is invited outside.

What is going on? Ive no idea. There is no gun, they need to find Tyra. Her father tells where she is, the police take her into protective custody. Im glad its over. Tyra offers corroboration and tells about Aileens storage shed in Daytona. She will cooperate in a telephone call. Tyra gets another call from Aileen. She talks about suicide. This convinces Aileen to confess and clear Tyra; she does. Im very sorry for the killings. She was tried, convicted, and executed in 2002.

The movie said she was raped by her father and brother, and gave birth to a child at age 13! It was taken away from her. With a hard life like that why was nothing done by local government? Do other killers have a history of an abused childhood? [Or make it up to gain sympathy?] What about her relatives? Would an extended family made a difference instead of a nuclear family? What about Child Protective Services? This does not excuse her later actions. Why do some children turn bad? Is it abuse at home? What did her school teachers do? An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Her killings were done for money. If she had a good job at good pay would this have happened? Serial killers are hard to detect since there is no prior connection to the victim. Most murders occur between people who know each other. There is another movie on this case with another point of view.",1462233600,,2938,4.49812734082397

Not to discount any of the murders after the first one, although none of us has all of the facts, but it's not hard to see that the woman had a screw loose. She had a screwed up life every step of the way and could not process human interaction properly. raped from the age of 7 through and including being a prostitute. What does that do to your head?

627658,4,6303336205,"Interesting take on the Wuornos investigation, trials, and the people surrounding Aileen. It's easy to see the woman had many issues stemming from an abusive childhood, followed by a tough life as she grew up on the streets fending for herself. This documentary lends to the possibility that Aileen was raped by the first man she shot. Her testimony on the stand does seem credible.
The woman that adopted Aileen and her ""paid attorney"" convinced her to plead no contest to the other shootings and claimed that Aileen wanted to die. You will see how those people and most around her took advantage of her and her infamousness for profit. Even police officers involved in her case and her ex-lover who knew about her criminal acts were negotiating for movie deals before she was sentenced. Eventually, the officers were caught and reprimanded, but Aileen's ex never was charged with any crime.

627662,4,6303336205,"In this separate but companion DVD to the film ""MONSTER"" depicting the life of prostitute and serial killer - Aileen Wuornos, this DVD is the actual footage of the 1992 trial within the State of Florida. Complete with courtroom testimony from her former lover who used and betrayed her with damaging evidence..., that got Aileen convicted and sentenced to death by lethal injection. She was more than just a highway and biker bar prostitute, she was a serial killer. This compelling documentary features pre-trial jailhouse interviews with Aileen, her then attorney and with others who also, knew her. In addition, her childhood is discussed and reenactments that led up to her becoming a prostitute are reviewed, as well. This is a serious adult documentary showing the steady pattern of abuse that led this woman to 'snap' and initiate brutal and sustained killings of the john's that solicited her sexual services. And it is evident that even as her former lover was setting her up and testifying against her, it was obvious that Aileen through it all, still loved her. Riveting viewing in which the beholder cannot remain detached. You're either for this woman or you're against her. Either she deserved what she got or she didn't. Self-defense or not self-defense?

But in the last 20 or 30 minutes, the interview with Aileen Wuornos began.  From what I have seen on other documentaries, I viewed her as either stoic, or entirely angry.  In the interview, she was, at times, giddy and happy as a school girl, always smiling and trying to be charming.  Once it finished, I had to go back and watch the interview again.  Amazing.

More than the story of what makes a serial killer - this is the story of one womans free fall through the cracks of society. Where everyone drops the ball in one giant foul play of greed and incompetance.

From the police that arrested her and were eventually fired in a sting operation for peddling her movie rights. To the woman who adopted her to sell interviews at 10 grand a pop to her incompetent lawyer who both abused her civil rights and sold her out. And all the way back to her tormented childhood - this film is terrifying but not so much for her crimes as it is for the collective rape of her rights before she was found guilty by due process.

The film doesn't excuse her crimes nor does it try and justify them. It's unflinching and blinding light comes from Wauornes herself as she exposes each dark corner and each secret of both her life as a killer and the Laws and institutions that failed her.",1358812800,8,1075,4.479591836734694

627756,4,6303336205,"Aileen Wuornos became known as America's first ""female serial killer"" after committing a series of 7 murders against men who solicited her as a prostitute. Aileen claimed self-defense from rape but ended up pleading guilty upon the advice of her incompetent lawyer, Steve Glazer, and her nutty fundamentalist adopted step-mother, Arlene Praelle.

The best part of the film was the interview with Aileen herself. She comes across as a person who is clearly emotionally damaged, partially due to childhood sexual abuse by her father. But she also is suprisingly intelligent and aware of how she is being used and manipulated by those around her.

Much of the rest of the movie involves the director, Nick Broomfield, visiting with Steve and Arlene in hopes they can help him set up an interview with Aileen. Steve and Arlene demand money for themselves and definitely come across badly. But I also think Bromfield himself comes across as a hypocrite since he, like they, is obviously using Aileen in order to make money and advance his career.

Aileen, on the other hand, is angry about how she is being abused by the system, especially the corrupt cops who are involved in a movie deal based on her case. But, of course, she is in jail and powerless to change her circumstances. She is hoping Broomfield can help her get an appeal. But he seems not to have helped her much in that regard.

627758,4,6303336205,"Though by now outdated, this 1992 documentary of Aileen Wuornos outlines a tragic, horrible story of a woman who was fated for disaster from childhood, with one terrible event following another, until she was labeled as the ""first woman serial-killer"" for the murder of seven men during 1989-1990, and was betrayed by her girlfriend Tyria Moore into a confession, and also allegedly had her case manipulated by some investigators who were at the same time making movie deals.

Aileen was a person who comes off as a tough, street-smart woman, who is also an emotional and psychic disaster zone; the doctors who examined her described her as ""a damaged and primitive child"",

Made by Nick Broomfield, this documentary has some fuzzy audio at times, and camera shots that on occasion weave and jump, but there are many sections that are gripping, like the footage of Wuornos in court as well as being interviewed in jail, and the chilling tour of ""Old Sparky"", as the Florida electric chair is nicknamed (in January of 2000, Florida Legislature allowed lethal injection as an alternate method for death).

I first heard of Wournos from the TV film ""Overkill: The Aileen Wournos Story"" which had a fabulous portrayal by Jean Smart, but which Wournos herself called ""bogus"".  Since then there have been many books and films on her story, and much money has been made from this woman who lived in poverty, and scratched out a living as a prostitute.

Aileen Wournos was executed on October 9th, 2002, by lethal injection.

There is little discussion about whom she murdered or exactly for what reasons other than Ms. Wuornos claim of `self-defense'.  Although it can be interesting to see the large range of human reactions from Ms. Wuornos, there is little insight as to her motives.  The big stars here are the putrid, immoral folks who befriend her `in her best interest'.  Enter her absolutely beyond sleazy attorney `born-again' Christian lawyer.  Ms. Wuornos even has a middle-aged woman adopt her and despite her cutesy attitude, it becomes clear she is a moronic minded scammer as well.  Both the lawyer and the adoptive parent are out to make money on the selling of movie rights of their `client' and `daughter'.  The only thing more sickening is the revelation that several local police are also into `cashing in' on movie rights.

7843964,4,6303336205,"I find Aileen's story and accusations of ppl doing whatever to make money from her sad/tragic life and death intriguing. By Nick going into her background and women not being serial killers by nature seems like this woman was set up to fail in life. NOT at all that she had the right to kill but there certainly was a  horrible backstory to this 1 lost person & others ""selling"" her story while she sat in Prison...I DO give her credit for coming forward to the families of those men she murdered and telling them the truth of the situations. That the men were NOT all trying to hurt her as she maintained at her trial. Her honesty about wanting the imminent death for her actions to come quickly instead of sitting on death row over a decade.",1462406400,2,743,4.384057971014493
