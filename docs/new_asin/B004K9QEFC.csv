8432639,5,B004K9QEFC,"A child in England loses her parents and is raised by her uncle, who adores her. As a young woman she enters a taboo romance with an American soldier going off to war. The uncle, hiding family secrets, forbids her to see the soldier once he finds out about the romance. This is a beautiful movie filmed in technicolor with colorful costumes and settings. The story starts slowly but increases steadily in interest. There is good acting, intense emotions, and  inspiring singing by Macdonald. If you're in the mood for a classic romance, this is an excellent choice. Its a full-box-of-tissues experience.",1497657600,,603,4.911764705882353
