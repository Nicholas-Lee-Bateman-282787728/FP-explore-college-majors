2042185,5,B0001XAR4A,"""As I Was Saying & More"" is a long-overdue appreciation of Jack Paar's influence on the television medium. As host of ""The Tonight Show"" from 1957 to 1962, he paved the talk-show road followed by Johnny Carson, David Letterman and numerous others. Paar was a brilliant monologist, cultural observer and undisputed master in the art of TV conversation. Happily, this VHS set includes a generous selection of rarely seen material, with a special video devoted to Paar's guest appearances and later work. The overall collection represents a landmark in television history that should be viewed by all generations.",1177804800,3,610,5.23469387755102

2042187,5,B0001XAR4A,"KULTUR, the company responsible for tranferring this video to DVD, should consider refunding the buyer's money, removing it from the market, and do the transfer over again using state-of-the-art video equipment. It is bad...VERY bad. However, Paar himself is tremendous, as well as the overall program material.

Even though I'm a HUGE fan of the late and great Johnny Carson,

Jack Paar not only was the innovator of the talk show format, but also had the talent to back up those staunch critics who claim he remains #1. I'm among those many.

His classic exchanges with Judy Garland and Jonathan Winters have never been equaled. They're priceless.

Buy this DVD...terrible transfer and all.",1119657600,13,692,5.097345132743363
2042188,4,B0001XAR4A,"This collection is a wonderful portrait of Paar, who was an egotist but very charming. My only objection is - give us more of him with his great guests. Where is Dody Goodman, Beatrice Lillie, more Jonathan Winters, Judy Garland, Bette Davis? - neither this nor the other recent DVD issue of Paar really showcases him at his best, in the company of the great talents he drew to the Tonight Show and established the reputation that Johnny Carson and Leno today still feed off. Paar touring Africa is interesting. Paar with his guests was fascinating. Will someone finish mining his vaults?",1082592000,11,588,4.7745098039215685

8017732,5,B0001XAR4A,I did so love the Jack Parr show.  Comedy was funny then whereas today it is either too silly or just dirty.  How I would laugh.  Brought back happy memories of when I was young living in a two family house.  My neighbor and I watched together and drank tea every night.  I would take two aspirins with my last cup of tea so I could go to sleep because I had to get up early to go to work.,1409961600,,389,3.8125
8017733,5,B0001XAR4A,"I first saw this some years ago on PBS as part of the American Masters series, waiting rather impatiently until the dvd was finally released. As I Was Saying. was my first real exposure to Jack Paar & his work. What a talented feller! The best part of the whole business (although the entire program is wonderful) is the fact that the dvd As I Was Sayingand More includes audio of the infamous WC story that NBC refused to air in 1960. Those of you who may never have heard it, I won't spill the beans but will say it just might be one of the funniest things never aired on NBC.",1392681600,,578,4.169642857142857
8017734,5,B0001XAR4A,I was a huge fan of Jack Paar and hardly ever missed his shows.  The Tonight Show with Jack Paar from New York was probably the smartest and most entertaining talk show ever.  He brought people on his show because they were interesting conversationalists and he brought out the best in them.  This DVD from shows of the later years shows just a few sparkling moments out of so many.  A must see for Paar fans.,1382140800,,409,4.342105263157895
8017735,5,B0001XAR4A,"This documentary originally aired in 1997 as an AMERICAN MASTERS SPECIAL on PBS.  I was too young to remember Jack Paar's stint on THE TONIGHT SHOW (NBC, 1957-62), but I do remember watching him on THE JACK PAAR PROGRAM (NBC, 1962-65).  This is an excellent documentary that tells Paar's life story from his Michigan childhood (he had a stuttering problem) to his World War II service in the Army, his days in radio, his short-lived Hollywood career, and his burgeoning TV career, beginning as a writer and guest host for Red Skelton, followed by his own series on CBS, and then the offer of a lifetime from NBC to host TONIGHT, which at that time was on its last legs (a couple of post-Steve Allen formats had failed miserably).  Jack took over the show in 1957 and successfully hosted it for five years, making TONIGHT the powerhouse franchise it still is today (Jack left TONIGHT in early 1962; guest hosts, including Merv Griffin, filled in until Johnny Carson took over on October 1, 1962.  After Johnny's retirement in May 1992, Jay Leno took over and has hosted THE TONIGHT SHOW ever since (except for the ill-fated period in 2009-10 when Conan O'Brien hosted TONIGHT for a few months, while Leno moved to prime time)).

Jack then moved to prime time in 1962, retiring in 1965.  He made a few specials and guest appearances after that, and made another comeback in 1973 with JACK PAAR TONIGHT on ABC (nothing from that show is on this DVD).  Among the guests that Jack had over the years were Buddy Hackett, Judy Garland, Jonathan Winters, Oscar Levant, Dody Goodman, and political figures as diverse as John and Robert Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Barry Goldwater.  Bonus features include a photo gallery, credits for his entire TV career, a mini-documentary about JFK and PT-109, which aired on THE JACK PAAR PROGRAM (although the DVD packaging says that it aired in the late '60s), and the audio of the censored ""water closet"" joke from 1960, which caused Jack to leave THE TONIGHT SHOW for a while, although he eventually returned.

Overall, the picture quality is good, considering the age of the clips.  Although the show was broadcast in Living Color, the clips were preserved in B&W, as was common in those days.

For those who like Jack Paar, this is an excellent purchase.",1352592000,,2288,4.752525252525253
8017736,5,B0001XAR4A,"This is a great DVD and because of my age I remember all of the people in it and all of the clips shown. Haven't laughed that hard in 50 years ! Stuff was funny , music was real, jokes were laughable, and Talk shows were really worth waiting up for !  Great DVD  Thanks",1324857600,,269,3.8727272727272726
8017737,5,B0001XAR4A,"Wit, charm,  poise, affability, self debasement, and a good sense of humor without vulgarity-all qualities that you just don't see anymore. One of a kind. Fun to watch.",1312416000,,168,5.0
8017738,5,B0001XAR4A,"Just a little background on this piece (I was involved in the production of the program as production manager, assistant editor and a half dozen other things).

What is on the DVD is what went into the 3 VHS set, and the transfer to DVD was done with then state-of-the-art multi-pass encoding equipment from the original master tapes, which came from the digital editing system, using the same files that created the original PBS broadcast program. We did go back and add a little material here and there to the first two parts of the show that we had been forced to cut fromt he broadcast version due to running time issues. The last portion was created especially for the video release version.

The comment that Kultur was responsible for a sub standard product is not true. We created the DVD and provided it to Kultur to distribute. The quality issues made mention of came into play LONG before the DVD encoding was ever done. You see, I know something that you don't: There are essentially NO original 'master tapes' of Paar's Tonight Show days. At the time video tape was brand new, and a daily show was not a place to waste that. NBC was required to keep 'air checks' for legal reasons. At the time, they made kinescopes of the shows (16mm film camera pointed at a TV monitor) for several years. Later in the run they did switch to video tape. Here comes the tragic part -- in the 70s, NBC got tired of paying for the climate controlled warehouse space in NJ where the tapes and much of the film records (of Paar and countless other programs) were stored, and had them disposed of. I suppose they are in a NJ landfill someplace at this point. Some of the Kiniscopes are apparently in the Library of Congress, but when we made ""...As I Was Saying"" we simply did not have the budget to get them out of storage and have them transferred.

What we DID have to work with was Jack's private collection of clips he had personally managed to get some engineers at NBC to lay off onto 3/4"" U-Matic tape when we put together a program he did for several years in venues such as cruise ships and the like. I gotta tell you, U-Matic is NOT a pretty format, and it had not held up well over the years of Jack doing editing at home on his own equipment. Jack would come to our facility two or three times a week in his purple Rolls Royce convertible with a box of beat up 3/4"" tapes and work with us to pull the most noteworthy pieces off of them and transfer them to more stable tape formats. If we could do so while we had them, we would just run the entire reel off, but often that was not possible.

Recall please that ""...As I Was Saying"" was NOT intended as a Tonight Show retrospective -- it was a Jack Paar profile. We had little budget to work with and a lot of politics to contend with (not going to get into that here). We did the best we could with what we had to work with. As long as Kultur is still using the DVD files we created (and I doubt they would have spent the money to do any different), then the quality is is good as it will ever be given the sources we had to work with.",1264291200,17,3091,4.260647359454855
8017739,5,B0001XAR4A,"I can honestly say I never saw a Jack Paar show but I knew who he was. In some ways I think he's better than Johnny Carson. He had a longer and more comprehensive monologue for instance. He quit too soon. Very good information on Jack and I loved the ""W.C"" joke (audio only) that led him to leave the show and then come back. I never knew the whole story behind that.",1223510400,2,367,4.041095890410959
8017740,2,B0001XAR4A,"I have a question for the people that have ordered any of the Jack Paar DVDs.....Are there any shows with Brother Dave Gardner on the show???He was guest host june17,1958 but was on the show many many times. I would like to order that particular DVD,if anyone has seen him on the DVD that they ordered. Please list which DVD he is on...
Thank you soooo much...cj",1188345600,,362,4.417910447761194
