4468303,4,B004ULNJJ4,"""It's 12:06, I had a reservation for 12:45, you just blew it.""  David Alan Washington (Moore) is a very controlling man, everything must be on time and to his liking.  When he comes home to find his fiance Robin (Atkins) with another man he calls off the wedding.  Then begins to date Tina, and becomes much, much worse.  Some movies you watch have such an emotional impact on you that it effects your judgment of the film.  This is one of them.  The acting from the main cast is good (the supporting is if'y at best) but the Washington character distracts you from the flaws of the movie and you focus all your attention on how much you hate him and want horrible things to happen to him. The steps he takes in order to control the women in his life are very dangerous, and the fact that some people are actually like this is terrifying. It's hard to fully judge how good the movie was because of the hatred you feel toward the main character. It has such a polarizing affect that you can't stop watching because you want to see him get what he deserves. Overall a much better movie then I expected and I think everyone should watch this in order to see the way this ""man"" acts. You will like the movie but hate David.  I give it a B+.

Would I watch again? - I would if someone who hasn't seen it wants to watch it.

I wish also everyone would watch it and see how easy it is, the only thing as a woman I wish we all would understand no one deserves to be hit and don't think if they say I'm sorry they won't  do it again....fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me....",1461456000,,635,4.023809523809524

4468485,1,B004ULNJJ4,"Like someone else said I can't believe there are a lot of people who actually like this movie. This movie was a film that could have been great but was a big fail. At certain parts, I feel like the director didn't know if he wanted to make this a suspense/drama or a comedy. There were a number of scenes that were not needed. Scenes that the director thought would be funny but were corny as all out doors. The acting was over the top and horrible. Case in point Essence Atkins who is the main character. She's a trained actor but she was beyond horrible in this film. Tempest Bledsoe was horrible and I could go on and on.  There was a line in the film where the lead psycho says something like ""I rather you put your private in my mouth, than in my woman"". Now what straight man do you know would say such a thing to anyone? I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters. (spoiler) Then at the end they do a whole 180 and make it all about sisterhood then play the song 'We are family"". It just didn't seemed on course with the movie and didn't seem like a way to end a suspense film like this one. I was going to give this film at D but after the ending I had to give it an F.",1409443200,3,1180,4.0

He has no respect for women, he's obsessed with time, he's selfish and downright evil. It's clear where his issues started and all I could do was shake my head at how that person had damaged him.

I decided to watch this movie because Tempestt Bledsoe (Jill - my favorite character), Essence Atkins (Robin) and Denise Boutte (Tina) have parts. It was nice to find out Elise Neal (Leslie) and Bernadette Stanis (Dr. Heather) were also in it, because I haven't seen them in a while. N- Secure was difficult to watch to the end, but I had to see what happened with David and what choice Jill (Tempestt Bledsoe) was going to make.

4468543,1,B004ULNJJ4,I wasted my time and money when I went to see this in the movies.  The actors were horrible.  The storyline was excellent but the wrong actors/actresses were used.  If Tyler Perry had done this movie with Blair Underwood it would've easily been four stars.,1331424000,,256,4.644444444444445

4468558,3,B004ULNJJ4,"This movie was pure comedy to me, this guy couldn't be serious!

The quality was good, and that was the only good thing about it.

4468561,5,B004ULNJJ4,i really loved this movie. this movie show what women are going through today and should not have too.  Women should also watch who they think is the man when they are not..excellent movie,1320624000,2,188,4.529411764705882
4468562,1,B004ULNJJ4,"I can't believe folks are giving this movie five stars. This movie has the typical Tyler Perry plot, lots of D list actors and some seriously bad acting i.e crying without tears, long pauses between lines. There is a pointless cameo from Bernadette Stanis from the TV show Good Times; love her but hate that she is forced to appear in this crap for the dough. Also, obnoxious Nephew Tommy appears in few scenes wearing cheap, polyester suits from his uncle's clothing line.

4468576,4,B004ULNJJ4,"I'm from Memphis, so it was good to see familiar faces and places throughout the movie. The story line was better than what I expected.

4468580,5,B004ULNJJ4,"Now this is a thriller where everybody had their place and the lead was such a bastard that you couldn't wait for him to get his in the end!  This was a very put-together piece and Cordell Moore earned his spot as the time-obsessed David Washington.  If he couldn't get it on the minute, then he wasn't having it!  I love black cinema when it's done with care, whether it's romance, action or even sci-fi and this leads the top of my charts.",1313366400,4,441,4.289156626506024

4468582,4,B004ULNJJ4,This movie was intense with the main character making you laugh in disbelief as well as gawking in awe at his behavior. This will definitely be a Christmas break review movie with the family.,1312243200,,191,4.647058823529412

4468595,1,B004ULNJJ4,"Please, please, disregard any positive reviews of this terrible, terrible movie. Overall, it's very poorly done -- the writing, cinematography, acting -- everything is simply terrible! This film makes Tyler Perry look like Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee! (Even Tyler Perry fans will be offended by the ultra-poor quality of this thrown-together urban affair -- and that's saying a lot!) Especially poor in performance is the lead male character, Cordell Moore: he's too old for the role, too flat and one-dimensional for it, and to put it kindly, leaves a great deal to be desired in the acting department! He recites one of the most offensively inappropriate lines (about preferring a man do ""this"" to him, as opposed to doing ""this"" to his woman) you will hands down ever hear in a bad movie -- guaranteed! He is boring. The film is boring. And the story has been told many times before, in much more entertaining ways! No one is convincing -- to the point of being laughable.  Usually, we can garner an unintended laugh from poor productions like this -- you know, when they're so bad, they're good. But not in this case: it's simply bad on all levels -- and there's no humor to be found. (Also, of note in the poor acting department: Elise Neal. Wow, what an amateur!) This movie is an inexcusable, utter waste of time; I'm actually ashamed I rented it. Consider it a momentary lapse in taste and judgment on my part -- but for you, please heed my warning through this negative review, and avoid this dull-as-dirt time-waster at all costs!",1311206400,7,1541,4.728624535315985
4468596,1,B004ULNJJ4,"In all honesty this is a decent well made movie, but the hidden agenda is the reason for the one star.  You see I probably should have known from the jump after I saw that the lead character was in one of Tyler Perry's plays.  I'm a straight man and if there is one thing I don't like is when homosexuals make straight movies and slide their agenda to normalize their way of life into the world.  I mean what was the real purpose of the main character saying ""I'd rather a man stick his d*** in my mouth rather than in my woman"".  One of the most sickening lines that I've heard in a movie and also one of the worst!  It had no relevance to the movie we already knew how crazy he was.  But this type of stuff is what you get when down low brothas and homosexuals get together and make a movie.  Just real talk, I know that I will get haters...",1310428800,3,843,4.0119760479041915

4468598,2,B004ULNJJ4,"While this was an ok film with a common run of the mill storyline; it could have been a whole lot better and entertaining had they allowed, maybe, Robi Reed to cast it for them as far as males in the film. Had the lead been Blair Underwood, who has the background for this part and would have made the lead character a more difficult, as well as interesting study...given HANDSOME, SOPHISTICATED, and wealthy; I would have watched it time and time again (a personal preference). Also the wardrobe of the male friend was not up to the standard of the overall attaire of the cast. It was tacky and unsophisticated and just did not fit. Will I watch it again, when someone who hasn't seen it might want to watch it......and to see if they agree with me. I probably would have waited to get it at a reduced price, had I known what I know now. I would give it 2 and 1/1 stars. LOL",1310256000,2,875,4.245508982035928

I wouldn't watch it again (the acting wasn't as great as I expected since these people are seasoned actors), but the plot was definitely good. I like that it wasn't entirely predictable. There were a few surprises in there. The main character was...wow! He was crazy, but entertaining, the epitome of a villain. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes dramatic movies with a strong villain character.",1308873600,,451,4.87012987012987
4468600,5,B004ULNJJ4,"Absolutely every thing about this movie was great.  All aspects were in the pocket. The acting was on point by all the characters. The plot gave no hint to the surprise ending, that will floor you.  Ladies get your hankies ready.

Can't compliment the ladies in this film enough they carried it off so well it make you believe you know them form the neighborhood.

The editing, the musical interludes, the scenery that compliments Memphis so well.

But most of all the way every thing comes together.

Rent it buy it watch it again and again you won't be sorry.

And it was good to see Burnadett Stanis from good times back in action, even thought it was a cameo part it was good to see her.
