8226414,2,B000X1FQOQ,"I have the Power Sculpt, Cardio Max, Boot Camp, Last Chance Workout and Weight Loss Yoga DVDs but was very disappointed in these first DVDs from the Biggest Loser line. I haven't even looked at one of them because the first was so disappointing. The ""high intensity"" 20 minute cardio was lame and was definitely not 20 minutes long. I guess this was their first attempt at workout videos and they got better with the later ones. unfortunately, I started with the later DVDs, so these look very amateur.",1290816000,2,502,4.651685393258427
