3747118,4,B001PCNZEU,"I watched the movie 1612 in Russian with no sub titles in PAL format when I was in Ukraine during the summer of 2008. I know very little Russian therefore I had to go by the action of the movie & ask questions along the way. Basically the movie was about the time when the Czar's seat was empty after the death of Czar Boris Godunov. The Polish-Lithuanian government/army with the help of the Roman Catholic church moved into the political vacuum & tried to influence Russian culture, religion, & political leadership. The hero of the story Andrey was once a friend of Princess Ksenia, the daughter of Godunov, who was taken as a political prisoner by the Polish-Lithuanians & Andrey was made into a slave or serf. Later when they see each other from a distance, Andrey has himself sold to a Spanish Mercenary who is hired by the Polish-Lithuanian army to perfect their cannons. Later the Spanish Mercenary teaches Andrey to fight & when the Spanish Mercenary meets an untimely death, Andrey pretends to be the Spaniard. The story continues with a love triangle & large battle for the city of Moscow.

The year 1612 is to Russians as 1776 is to Americas: freedom from an outside power & development of ones own cultural identity & purpose. The Unicorn seen in the movie is a symbol of old Russia before the Double Eagle symbol of the Czar & is shown several times as a dream scene to convey what was lost & could be regained.

The war scenes are top notch with lots of stand-ins with fantastic Polish-Lithuanian Calvary with angel wings. The movie does get a little bloody during the battle scenes, but isn't that real war?

History versus Movie Making: In the movie the Russians are defending Moscow from the Polish-Lithuanian army, but historically the Russians attacked a Polish-Lithuanian garrison within the Kremlin because the Polish-Lithuanians were already in Moscow.

Controversy: the movie was commissioned by the Kremlin & may hold certain Russian political ideals because it was released on November 1, 2007 to help with the new ""National Unity Day"" to celebrate the retreat of the Polish-Lithuanian troops from Moscow around November 4, 1612. This new holiday replaces the old Soviet November 7 celebration of the 1917 Revolution.

Rating PG-13 or R?: Russian films don't go by our system of rating. There is some female nudity in the movie when young Andrey sees the princess take a bath with her female court, but the scene is not too offence. Normally any movie about war will included a certain level of violence which should be considered.

What makes this movie so profound is the portray of a Starets, which is a Russian Orthodox spiritual director who normally is clairvoyant, who is also a Stylites, which is a Christian ascetic who stands on a pillar preaching, fasting, & praying. One day a Roman Catholic monk who is clean shaven with a crown hair cut, a finely dressed cowl, & who is the advisor from the Pope to help the Polish-Lithuanians against the Russians, comes across the Russian Starets who tells him to pick up his cross which are contain in a basket. This changes the Roman Catholic monk who then becomes a wandering hermit & when he returns to Rome with ragged clothes & full beard, the Pope almost faints.

There are still Starets in Russia as well in other parts of the world including America, but a Stylite ended in the mid 1400's in Russia. Therefore to join both concepts of Orthodox monasticism in the 1600's is not historically possible but makes a good movie image. To see what comes close to a real Starets see the Russian film Ostrov (The Island).",1247529600,21,3596,4.73482428115016
3747119,4,B001PCNZEU,"""1612"" is a sprawling epic in the mold of ""Braveheart"" and ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan.""  Russia is facing its bloodiest conflict.  As a volunteer army faces off against Polish-Lithuanian invaders, the Russian government lies in shambles.  The assassination of Tsar Boris Gudunov, his young wife, and his son and heir has thrown Russia into a relentless power struggle.  The only witness to the murder of the Tsar's family is a young servant boy, Andrey.  Infatuated with the Tsar's beautiful daughter, Ksenia, Andrey hopes she might still be alive amid the chaos that has become the norm in Moscow.  As lawlessness rages while power passes from one usurper to the next, Andrey sets off to find the missing princess.  The personal story of Andrey's quest against the background of violent anarchy makes for an exciting action drama that depicts the physical and emotional toll of war on the common man.

3747121,1,B001PCNZEU,"1612 is a movie created to generate income.  As fantasy, five stars.  As history, non-existant.

The producers use the 'tried and true' plot of unrequited love, a large army of bad guys, and scrappy 'peaceniks-turned-warriors' to save the nation.

Did not have a version with English language subtitles. Translations not necessary. The action is understandable.

As a Pol-Am, I was cheering for the Polacy in every battle.  Good to see the Poles as the 'heavys'.

This is an excellent example of 'historical fiction'.  Good music.  Great costumes. Not for children.

3747122,5,B001PCNZEU,"Based in history, 1612 tells the true tale, which has now grown into legendary proportion, of the fight for Russia in the early 1600's after the country fell into choas following the murder of the czar and his family. With a 'cast of thousands' portrayal, and mysticism cast throughout, the tale is centered on the saving of a young princess by a young boy. However, the epic battles compete with the best epic battles in film history, and the stunning filming is simply glorious to experience.

If you are a fan of history, this is a spectacular epic to view. If you are a fan of epic battles, this is a must-see experience, from the heated cannonballs to the man-to-man fighting.

1612 was sanctioned by and underwritten by the Kremlin, so important a film it was to be created.",1237766400,57,780,4.60431654676259

I really what to see this movie on NTSC with sub-titles so that I can fill in the blanks. Buy this DVD if you have a PAL formatted DVD player & if you know Russian because I don't know if this version comes with English sub-titles.

3747127,5,B001PCNZEU,"In the tradition of epic Russian folktales, 1612 is a spectacular historical fantasy that will keep you riveted to the triumphant end.

The Tsar, Boris Gudonov  and the royal family have been murdered. In the chaotic aftermath, with pretenders to the throne too numerous to count, Russia collapses into civil war. Foreign powers seize the opportunity to plant their flags on Russia's territory, ultimately aspiring to add it to their imperial gains.

In the truest Russian folk tradition, a peasant hero rises to the occasion. Andrey, a former servant of the Gudonov family, begins this tale as the least of all slaves, reduced to pulling boats on the river. However, a chance encounter with Princess Ksenia, the sole survivor of the Gudonovs, changes his fate considerably. Purchased out of his hopeless state by a Spanish mercenary, Andrey learns the skills of warfare from his new master, ultimately taking on the persona of the Spanish cavalier.

In his quest to save his nation and his beloved princess, Andrey is aided by all manner of friends, mortal and supernatural. With great daring and panache, Andrey takes on increasingly dangerous trials of bluff and bluster, ...fighting duels, saving maidens in distress, and defending Moscow from an invading Polish army.

In the end, like so many heros in Russian folklore, Andrey strives boldly out of obscurity to seize the day, administer justice unto the wicked, and take the prize.",1415491200,,1438,5.102127659574468

3747140,4,B001PCNZEU,"1612 takes place during Russia's Time of Troubles when the country had many claimants to its throne following a Polish invasion that killed Tsar Boris Godunov and his family, all except Princess Ksenia who is one of the characters. (The subtitler calls her Tsarina but the correct honorific is Tsarevna.)Prince Pozharski and maybe one or two others are real historical personages, but mostly this is an epic historical fantasy with made-up characters. I think of it as the Star Wars of historical epics, great to look at but not to be taken seriously. It's filled with wonderful imagery. The vision of winged Polish hussars riding into battle is spectacular. The wings extend up from the back to arch over the helmet. The costumes looked so impractical that I thought it was one of the movie's excesses. The joke was on me. Search ""winged hussars"" at Wikipedia and check out the ""Hetman's Guard"" picture. The piece de resistance of the movie features a Polish attack on a Russian fort. Very well done. There is a jaw-dropping scene in which a cannonball blows the top half of a combatant away and leaves the legs standing there until they fall over. Physically impossible, of course, but eye-popping nonetheless. The major battle in the movie was a minor battle in reality and the historically important battle was glossed over quickly at the end. But, hey, what do you want from a movie with a unicorn in it? The image of the ancient monk up a tree who vowed never to come down until Russia has a new tsar is pretty cool too.

  This movie has two actors with incredible screen presence and neither one is Russian. Ramon Langa is a Spaniard who fittingly enough plays a Spanish mercenary and Michael Zebrowsky, a big star in Poland, plays the Polish hetman, who is a main character despite never being given a name.

  I should point out that the protagonist is impossible to believe in. The movie starts with him as the lowest of the low, even lower than a serf, an uneducated slave with an iron collar around his neck, part of a chain gang being whipped as they tow a boat upriver. Before the movie is over he is a master swordsman, somehow learns to speak Spanish, and, oh yes, he knows how to build a cannon. And of course he has a humorous sidekick and is asked to become the new tsar. This is the kind of thing I'd grouse about if I hadn't actually liked the movie, but it's so damned much fun to watch, I didn't care. During the extras the director said that he wasn't interested in making a historically accurate film. He was out to make an historical epic that is fun to watch. IMO he succeeded admirably.",1360281600,,2615,4.565031982942431
3747141,2,B001PCNZEU,"The movie takes artistic licence with real events. Polish troops are thrown back from Moscow. Yet they actually held the city for two years. Poles are depicted as murderous barbarians.  Anyone who knows Russian History (not the other reviewers) from Ivan the Terrible to Stalin know otherwise.

Otherwise watch Ogniem i Mieczem for a historical action/adventure movie.  Not 1612 trying to encite anti-Polish propoganda to peddle a new ""Soviet"" styled Russian holiday. Unicorns? GMAFB!

3747143,4,B001PCNZEU,"This is a very entertaining Russian film from 2007. While the film is loosely based on historical events (from 1612 Russia), no attempt has been made to be historically accurate. This does not matter to me at all: I greatly enjoyed this film for its unique mixture of fast-paced adventure and fantasy. There is quite a lot of graphic violence in the battle scenes of this film (on the level of ""Braveheart""); so you should probably skip it if you hate carnage. The battle scenes between the (brave, freedom-loving) Russians and the Polish Army are quite well done.

As the movie begins, Tsar Boris Godunov and all but one of his family have been murdered, causing Russia to descend into leaderless chaos. The story follows Andrei, the hero, as he tries to track down Princess Ksenia, the Tsar's only surviving child (a beautiful daughter, of course). From beginning to end, this action-packed movies maintains a very fast and exciting pace. Any more information will make me guilty of dropping ""spoilers.""

There is this thing about Russia - its ability to suffer through and survive - all the while being true to its faith in Orthodoxy and the national character it produced. This movie is a product of the relatively restored Russia which looks on its national past and is encouraged by its faith and perseverance. The legend and fantasy of the Unicorn are placed in the film confusing some - but if one looks closely the mystical use of that animal in the film serves a purpose. It is the symbolic image of the purity of the Russian faith in its God - capable of healing wounds deeply inflicted by foreign invasions and local treachery. The battle scenes are realistic and serve at times as a diversion to the director's true purpose - to show that faith in the Nation and the nation's God will overcome all adversity. In the end, the Czar triumphs and the era of the Romanoff's begins. One comes away with the feeling that the whole story is an attempt to set the stage for a restoration in modern day Russia of the old order. Time will tell...",1323043200,,1205,4.4324324324324325

3747155,4,B001PCNZEU,"The movie was fun to watch, and the subtitles do not distract from the action.  The translation of subtitles was literal (what did they use Babelfish?"" and was quite funny at times.  The story was interesting if not plausable.  A Russian serf passing himself off as a Spanish Mercenary-Artilleriest?

I am constantly amazed at the production values in films coming out of Eastern Europe.  The costumes, sets and special effects rival and surpass Hollywood's best.

My only criticism is technical pet peeves.  When will film makers talk to people educated in weapons and warfare for technical advice.  Bows and crossbows were notoriously sensitive to humidity.  Held together with water based glues, made of wood and woven natural fibers, immercing one in water would have rendered it useless.  So when I see a crossbowman submerge himself in a pond for an ambush while weilding a crossbow with a hemp bow string...I have to laugh.

The Angel wings on the Polish Cavalry was a nice authentic touch.

Some of the dicussion of this historical affectation, misses the point.  This was a time when the majority of the polulation were illiterate, they could not even read their own religious texts.  They were subjugated by not only their aristocracy but by the church as well.  The wings were there not to frighten the enemies horses, but to awe the serfs.  Remember Kings were ordained by God, so why should not the rulers or the army sent by Christ's Vicar the Pope look like the army of God.  Armies of the day and later were replete with affectations that were designed to awe and frighten ones opponents.  The crested helm morphed into the bearskin caps, bisbys and shakos of the Napoleonic era, all designed to make the soldier taller and more formidible.",1318896000,2,1756,4.8552188552188555
3747156,5,B001PCNZEU,"This rich, bloody film about Russia's Time of Trouble is an incredible epic that history buffs, war and action film fans will heartily embrace. it is a definite keeper - one I plan to watch several times over.

I thought 1612 would be a nightmare to review. I don't like subtitles. I don't typically care for period epics. Plus, the several of the last foreign films I reviewed were just a waste of my time.

Based on true events, this film from Russian director Vladimir Khotineko blew me away. Not once did I take my eyes off the screen. The story was engrossing, the filming great, the acting fantastic. Everything combined into a dynamite picture that immediately stoked my interested in Russia's Time of Trouble.

Tsar Boris Godunov and his family are murdered. His beautiful daughter, Princess Ksenia, is spared by the Polish Hetman, who is obsessively in love with her. He plans to marry her to capture the Russian throne.

A young man who had a school boy crush on the princess sets out to rescue her - and save Russia from doom. He is deeply religious, worshipping the treasured unicorn horn broken from one of the palace gates before the princess was taken. (The unicorn was revered by mystics during this time.) He prays to God always for strength.

Andrey is a barge puller - super strong men who literally pulled barges across the river. They were beaten and bloodied from mistreatment. He escapes his chains and gets to see the princess on a barge he is towing with others.

After his punishment for daring to set eyes on royalty, a Spanish trader purchases Andrey. He makes a friend. When the trader is murdered, Andrey assumes his identity and the ghost of the man teaches him how to fight with a sword.

These mystical lessons will prove invaluable when Andrey comes face-to-face with the evil Hetman.

1612 is one of the best period films I've seen in a long, long time. Andrey's journey reminded me a bit of Braveheart - he would never give up and never give in. He had a duty and he would fulfill it - death be damned.

The film was rich in history. It was incredibly clever, the way filmmakers blended modern items with the 17th century so that viewers didn't notice it (unless you know the date the first cannon is used).

One thing in this film I have never seen are warriors with wings. The bad guys have these soldiers who wear wing-like backs to their armor. I'm trying to find some historical documents about this - if it is true and which army had them. I believe it was the Polish Army that had them in this film. The closest thing I've found are hussars of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The photograph with this article has a uniform similar to that of the warriors in 1612: [...].

I thought this story must be close to history. However, brilliant director Khotinenko says it is fiction based on the real death of Tsar Godunov in 1605 and all the trouble that followed. What he created was pretty damn close to the truth - with a few modern touches that give the story flare for action film lovers.

Here is what I have extrapolated from Wikipedia and a few other sources: Godunov had a tough reign, with terrible harvests, freezing temperatures and economic woes. Godunov was the brother-in-law of Tsar Ivanovich of the Rurik Dynasty. He was a boyar - a Russian aristocrat - and members of the Romanov family - and throughout the nation - felt he was beneath the throne.

Several tried to take over the throne. These guys were called False Dmitriys. They claimed to be rightful heirs. Eventually, Poland took control and the Polish king decides to take Russia's thrown so they could all become Roman Catholics. This did not sit well with the people, who turned their backs on Catholicism shoved down their throats and became anti-Polish.

During this time, several men of God would go to the mountaintops and stand, weighed down by chains, and pray for their nation. They would not come down - or sit down - until the Time of Trouble was finished.

All of this is highlighted in Khotinenko's film. He pulls it brilliantly together through the eyes of Andrey (also spelled ANDREI).

In an ironic twist, the princess - who has developed a semi-crush on Andrey - is sent away to a convent. Andrey's friends create a fake ID to make him look like a true heir to the throne - just like the False Dimitriys he wanted out of Russian. Andrey takes the high road, admitting that he is a mere serf and Russia eventually goes to the Romanovs - who are eventually murdered during another cold-blooded royal killing.

The DVD extras include a Making Of 1612 that is a much watch. I was nearly as fascinated by this peek into the filmmaking as I was the film itself.

For instance, the barge the men were pulling at the beginning of the film was supposed to move with motors. However, the motors would not run. The actors ended up pulling it themselves and got it in one shot. Amazing dedication you would not find in spoiled Tinsel Town, where actors think doing their own ""stunts"" makes them special.

Also featured in the extras are special effects. They show how they created the scene where the Hetman is killed by a sword going down his throat. The Russians did not waste time and money on boring CGI images. They used props to create an incredibly realistic, bloody kill. Their innovation is fantastic to watch.

There were times when there were subtitles in both English AND Russian - I believe they were speaking French and Spanish during these times. For a girl who isn't into subtitles, this didn't bother me a bit. In fact, I thought it was kind of cool.

1612 is a great movie. You are not tied to the subtitles to understand what is happening on screen. You get it. The battle scenes are bloody - more realism and less gore than you see in American films. It is a fantastic watch - one you may find yourself drawn to over and over again.",1316649600,2,5875,4.560303893637227
3747157,5,B001PCNZEU,"This film is set at the beginning of the 17th century when Russia had a severe crisis over who was to inherit the throne after the Tsar died. There are many contenders but none too genuine. This was called the time of `chaos' as the people are leaderless, and the Poles had invaded Russia. Their Hetman (Michel Zebrowski) has captured the Tsarina Kseniya Godunova. He has fallen in infatuation with her and sees marriage to her as a way to legitimise his false claim to the throne.  Throw into the mix a lowly serf Andrei played by Pyotr Kislov, he really does love the Tsarina and through guile and cunning sets about saving her and in the long run, Russia too.

The opening sequences start in 1605 and we get a pocket `history' lesson to take us up to date. This is not a true history lesson though and quite happily mixes up faith, mysticism and myth with all the action. We have a holy man who won't come down from his tree until the chaos has ended, lots of iconography (very Russ indeed) and a recurring theme of Unicorns.  Whilst we are thrown into the current plight of the characters, the missing detail is told in vivid flashback, so by about half way through you get to understand the real histories of those involved and the attraction Andrei has for the Tsarina.

This has been criticised for being anti -Polish, well of course it is, this is a Russian film and the Poles are the enemy. They do get the best costumes though, they are all armoured up and wear wings to give them the look of avenging angels. That is one of the many strengths of this film, the costumes are stunning. Add to that the overall excellent cinematography and attention to detail and this makes for a real visual feast.

There is buckets of action too and it is done really well, the CGI that had to be used in places is so good that you really don't notice and as good special effects should do, it actually adds to the emotional upsurge that was intended.  Look out for the siege sequences, they are brilliant. My only complaint is around the subtitles, not everything is translated especially the Italian parts; and on occasion the Russian translation is over the English translation, making it virtually impossible to read.

That aside, this is a rollercoaster of a film, with action, intrigue, romance and a ruddy great story with excellent performances all round. Vladimir Khotinenko has done a masterful job in the direction of this film, and at 143 minutes has done superbly to keep the momentum up throughout. If you like action films based on historical events, then you will not be disappointed. If you want a history lesson this is not for you, but I thought it was just excellent and intend to watch again very soon.",1311897600,2,2717,4.543967280163599

3747159,5,B001PCNZEU,"It's a great experience to see the great Russian history in it's early glory. By glory I mean that only Russian TV can show how things really were that were based on books, facts. If the movie was done by any Hollywood, it would be a real American outlook on what Russia is. As the one to know Russian history deep enough I admit the movie depicts it in a full glory. Mystical things in a movie, not a fairy tale. It is a soul of Russia. A part of it's soul. The old man who chained himself and was carrying a cross depicts the true Russian soul. He may be old and everything but believe me I have seen a lot of unexplained things from that country and I am not afraid to admit that it is mighty. As every country it has it's black and white. But when the Phoenix rises once again, you will be blinded by it's light. And also made me think of why there is some people out there who hate the country? So they do not accept it's culture, or don't like other things about it. They say dirty things about the country and it's people and yet they anger the people, they go into a war and lose it. Why not to be angry even more after all this? And it made me think of another very common thing I see everywhere(starting from Europe and going everywhere else). People hate the Mighty Russia. But when time comes, everyone acts like a coward and claim to be Russian. If they have a dirty habits(and I seen those people and heard of them), they claim to be Russians, but when they act normal and have to prove nothing they are f.ex. Polish, and whatever. Now you ask how is it connected with a movie? Watch it for yourself(you won't regret it) and maybe it gives you questions as well as answers for these and other Q. and A. And just for the fact Russia went through a lot and I don't judge anymore why some people are a bad example. For any bad there is always some good. My advice for all of you is to get some Russian history books. There is a lot of interesting facts in there. Certainly you didn't know a lot about it. And I am sure of that. Be curious, and search.

I bought it on a whim -- it was on sale and I was curious to see how the Russians are doing epics these days of CGf/x -- and was completely blown away by its quality. I had trouble sleeping, in fact. There's a lot of Scott in it, but that's mainly in the style of cinematography, use of color, detailed battle scenes, etc. In this regard, it resembles Kingdom of Heaven, though not on such a large scale. There are some plot similarities, but the story also has overtones seen in Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress (and/or Star Wars)involving the restoration of royalty with the help of a plucky hero who doesn't seem to be acting out of sexual or romantic concerns. In the middle of the story, there's comic relief not seen in Scott's movies, and the hero starts looking a lot like Johnny Depp. In one of most memorable battles ever on the screen, however,a walled town which the hero is called upon to defend (Kingdom of Heaven-ish) is raked by the primitive artillery of the day, but in this case the audience actually sees the cannonballs flying through the air -- though at great speed -- and is able to track them as they do their deadly job. (This detail reminded me of the opening sea battle in Master and Commander which shows the details of a deadly volley from an enemy ship on the target ship.) Aside from the comic relief, there also seems to be a lot of black humor in the latter part of the film, but I don't know if the intended Russian audiences saw it that way. I don't recall it being released in the west for American audiences, but if it wasn't, that's a damn shame. By all means, get a copy of this, or you'll hate yourself if you ever see it in the future.",1299628800,4,1743,4.333333333333333
3747173,2,B001PCNZEU,"I like it, but I don't like it...

Funny, but true. As a modern action movie it stands at par with other similar stuff that even Hollywood manages to produce (see ""300"").

Not so much for special visual effects, of which there are virtually none, except for the occasional battle scene, but rather for the silliness in language and story development.

It is a simple fun movie. One for popcorn chewing moviegoers.

Unpretentious and yet captivating in its silliness.

At times, while watching it, I was reminded of movies of yesteryear, such as Errol Flynn's escapades in ""The Black Hawk"" or more recently Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow's shenanigans in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

Costumes and settings are gorgeous though, and even the music is pleasant and appropriate for a movie of this type. But let's face it,
it's just another cape and dagger movie, not really Russian history as it pretends to be.

Sure, there are hints to that (and many, but then again distributed freely throughout, without an actual chronology). All we get to know is that after Czar Boris Godunov's demise and that of his entire family (but one surviving Princess), there is a period of anarchy in Russia.

Add to this the ever-lasting ""bad"" Polish invader, riding in with very fanciful armor which sports applied feather wings (actually an accurate depiction, but just reserved for the Royal Polish Guards of that time and only worn during parades, never in battle - for obvious reasons) and you have Holiday on Ice.

True to history is the fact that after the fall of Czar Boris, Russia had been literally invaded by opportunistic tradesmen from everywhere in Europe. This has been simplified and centered around a central Hispanic figure, represented by a mercenary, and apparently, former Conquistador.
The reality though was different, and the so-called invasion was far less pervasive and intrusive. Europe simply needed new trade routes through Russia and did indeed send out emissaries for this purpose.

Yet then the entire story goes through a mystic development, even involving unicorns and a mysterious Hermit chained on a pole in the midst of a forest. It may be significant for Russians but for a foreign audience who may not know all the symbolic significances of this, it still remains a puzzle to the end of the movie.

As said, as an entertainment movie, not too bad, but as a pretense in historic fact it really leaks all over.

The actors, probably all unknown to the Western world are all competent, especially in secondary roles and do their job quite convincingly. The action scenes (battles, swordplay, fights, etc.) are all very well choreographed and at times, even spectacular.

But does this mishmash stand for something?

Not really.

Not even as other reviewers have stated, as a propaganda movie for the Medvevev / Putin duo.

If it is true that this movie was pushed by the Kremlin itself, then the taste of this entity has considerably diminished since Stalin's times.
But such are the times we are living in.

Not wanting the invasion of Western culture in their Country, in that sense at least, it is utterly a wasted effort, since this movie proves without a doubt that they have already been ""contaminated"" by this - bad taste - kind of trendy movie.

What next? Japanese ""Animes"" to entertain the masses in Russia too?

At least Stalin had Eisenstein to propagate his views, and those movies have become true Classics.

But ""1612""? Forgettable at best.

Being of Russian descent myself, I regret this popularization in Russian history. Why can't we have true historic, if not epic movies about the true history of Russia?

The theme alone, Boris Godunov, already made famous by a well-known Opera, should entice any film-maker deserving this definition, to make an extra effort and develop a true biopic around this figure.
But not just limited to this period.

All we have are just excerpts from Russian history. We never get the whole picture. What about the first Viking invasion of Russia, when it was still unknown under that name? In fact Russia takes the name from the first Conquerors of the land, which the native population named ""Rus"" after their reddish scalps and beards.

What ever happened between the Era of Boris and that of Peter the Great? Who were the various successors, what did they do, what have they achieved, how long did they all rule? These are all still unanswered questions that no one ever bothered to tackle with in any serious form.

I only wished that the new generation of movie-makers in Russia, but not just limited to Russia, would actually have that kind of culture and wisdom as to come up with some more original stuff than your average Action movie.

This DVD is no exception (I own three copies of it. One is the U.S. version, available here. One bought in France and one bought in Germany).
I wanted to test if there was actually a difference among versions, but there were none.
They all run at an approximate length of two hours and twenty-four minutes. There are virtually no special features (except on the French copy, which has ""The Making of"" feature).
The sound for all three is in DD 5.1 in Russian. The German copy gets an additional language track in German (also DD 5.1), while the other two versions only come with subtitles in their relative languages (the U.S. version in English and the French, obviously in French).

The image is crystal clear, although a bit too bright for my taste (but this may depend on how the movie was originally filmed).
There are absolutely no differences among the copies. The NTSC or region 1 copy, is exactly the same as the ones in PAL or region 2 code.

But as said, this is just an great spectacle entertainment with a pretense to be a historic movie, not truly a classic, and far, far away of true classic
cinematography a la Tarkovsky or Eisenstein. If you are looking for that kind of style, you're light years away.

I can only recommend it for a very young and inexperienced audience, and just as an approach to adventure movies.

For those who are demanding, you better buy something else, hoping that someone else makes the extra effort to finally come up with a series of movies which deal in true and serious historic fact about Russian history, instead of wanting to simplify it for the masses.

In my view, it just deserves 2 out of 5 stars, due to the effort made by all those involved in making it, but none should be given to the finished product which is offensively populist and to a degree as to be talking down at people that may know more about movies and history as well, than movie
makers these days.",1296864000,9,6631,4.75

Why I deducted a star in the rating: The film is not historically accurate and the director admits this in the extra features. The main character, Andrei, is extremely unlikeable. He was the stereotypical foolish hero with too much luck. Fools in real life don't have that much luck. Pyotr Kislov was great, but the storyline was the problem. The second half of the film was annoying as it didn't make sense why the people would follow a serf, even after so many let downs and against all odds.

The infamous and nefarious Tsar Ivan the Terrible is dead and a string of leadership figures ensue, all of which leads to innumerable bloody battles, including lots of swordplay.

Thereafter this slaughter in which Boris, widow and his successor are massacred, the faker False Dimitry assumed the throne. But just a year after, he is murdered too.

The only witness of Tzar' family's assassination is the young servant Andrei. This brutal and bloody fact remains in his memory being incapable to forget Boris Godunov's daughter.

He assumes the indemnity of his Spaniard and forges a real epic stature, inspiring and feeding the nobles efforts in order to make the legitimate heiress returns his stole place. So he will lead the defense and attack against the Polish hosts in one of the most demolishing and courageous battles ever filmed.

3747192,3,B001PCNZEU,"1612: KHRONIKI SMUTNOGO VREMENI is a strange Russian epic seemingly composed of pasted together bits of history, myth, and fiction by writer Arif Aliyev and directed with a complete lack of continuity by Vladimir Khotinenko.  Why these production choices were made in what is apparently supposed to be a critical turn of events in the history of Russia is unclear, but the reason for making the film seems to be to out-Hollywood Hollywood without the benefit of CGI that serve as Hollywood's main 'character' in epics of this sort.

Apparently from the title we are to accept this tale as a recreation of the death of Boris Fyodorovich Godunov  (1551 - 1605)  - de facto regent of Russia from 1584 to 1598 and then the first non-Rurikid tsar from 1598 to 1605. The end of his reign and the murder of his son saw Russia descend into the Time of Troubles.  There was a witness to these murders, one Andrei (Pytor Kislov) who fell into serfdom and then into being a mercenary with his friend Kostka (Artur Smolyaninov) for the Polish hetman (Michal Zebrowsski).  Apparently one Godonov remained, the Tsarina Kseniya (Violetta Davydovskaya) and was loved by both the Polish hetman and by Andrei.  The entire film is an extended battle between the Polish and the Russians for the control of Moscow and the dream of the Polish hetman to marry Kseniya and ascend the throne as the new Tsar.  The referenced year 1612 is the year of the Battle for Moscow when the Poles were successfully defeated making way for the rise of the Romanovs as the royal family of Russia.

Somewhere well hidden in this collage of decapitations and other examples of battlefield mayhem are the identities of the characters who populate this story, but the tale is so chopped up by amazingly bad editing (to the point that the film feels like there are large gaps missing as the screen simply goes dark frequently), by flights of fantasy that focus on a unicorn, moments when the past is recalled through the use of pixels of supposedly previously viewed material, and just plain lapses in plot details that the movie appears like a richly colorful blood bath with some unintentional (?) comedic moments.  The machinations of the battle between the winged Poles and the oh-so-inventive Russians fighting against all odds border on absurd.  But then perhaps that is the point of the film: war is madness and kingdoms are built by serendipity.  It is a long song and tedious, but if you know the realities of Russian history it may be a very entertaining movie!  Grady Harp, July 10",1278374400,10,2550,4.755102040816326

Be advised that speech is clearly recorded and uncomplicated (it is an action movie).  I wish sometimes that foreign language movies would offer subtitles in the same language (i.e. for hard-of-hearing) like many US films.

While Russian History may be obscure to moderns, it was not to 18th & 19th century Europeans who immortalized events in the operas like Boris Godunov, Tsar and Carpenter and Khovanshchina.  The classic painting of Volga Boatmen was by Repin, ca, 1870.  That scene was copied for the movie, according to the production notes.  The song Ey Ukhnem (Heave-Ho) is a traditional Russian song, popularized in the west by opera singer Fyodor Chaliapin, ca. 1930 - - a period in which things Russian (and revolutionary) were popular in the west.

Seeing that history is at best sketchy concerning this period, the producers purposely put together a plausible and interesting story involving real period characters - - throne-heir Xenia (Ksenia) Godunova,  invading Polish army leader Hetman Kybowski, Russian Prince Dmitri Pozharski, and the Roman Pope (Poland was Catholic).  (A popular Polish actor graciously accepted the villains role of the Hetman.)

Fictional characters - - Volga boatman (Andrey, a Spanish adventurer /swordsman (Alvar), a Catholic Priest, a Pillar Saint (stylite), and unidentified assassins - - who could have been involved.  For story purposes, young Andrei is a childhood neighbor of Xenia.  Add to this a display of 17th century military technology and tactics.  The White Unicorn that appears at scene changes, and in artifacts (unicorn horns), is a national symbol for Russia - - as the eagle (in various forms) is to a number of western nations.

The movie begins with a confusion of events, understandable only to historians!!  The era was called The Time Of Trouble (1600 - 1612)  following the death of Tsar Boris Godunov. In this period a number of contentious armed parties, including Polish Winged Hussars, offered their own candidates, all named Dmitri.  Eventually the Polish army was defeated and their leader (Hetman) executed.  Boris niece, Xenia Godunova, retired to a convent and national leaders (Boyars) chose a member of the Romanov family as successor.  All cleverly interwoven with the fictional characters.

A good movie worth repeated viewing to catch all the story details (without pressing their historicity).  View the production notes for enjoyable details.  Adults only and caution advised regards viewing in mixed company and regards battle scenes.",1492387200,,2655,5.2565320665083135

8333108,5,B001PCNZEU,"Well made movie. Strayed from the historical events, but then what movies do not. Acting was surprisingly good all round. Plenty of action with battle scenes very well realistically shot and without CGI. Only slight negative was that the subtitles tended to be very brief - found I had to read very quickly or do a quick rewind. Overall, well worth the money.",1426982400,,359,4.714285714285714
