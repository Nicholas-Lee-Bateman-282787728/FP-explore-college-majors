7420311,5,B014Q67MVI,I love the Spenser Series. Good wholesome acting. I love the interaction between Spenser and Hawk!!!,1444780800,2,100,5.3125
7420312,5,B014Q67MVI,Really enjoyed the series. Is there a season 4 available ?,1444780800,,58,4.363636363636363
7420313,5,B014Q67MVI,Glad to see it available on DVD. All the DVDs worked fine.,1444608000,,58,3.9166666666666665
7420314,5,B014Q67MVI,I love this series.  Wish it had lasted more than just three seasons.,1444608000,,69,4.3076923076923075
7420315,2,B014Q67MVI,"Season three is not playable on my DVD player. Season one and two work just fine on the same player. I returned the first Spenser Three I ordered and exchanged it for a second thinking the first copy was flawed. The second copy was just as the first. There is a warning on the back that says it might not operate in certain players that I did not find noted on the Amazon page but be that is it may, shouldn't the thrid season operate on the same machine as season one and two? Spenser For Hire is one of my favorite shows and I hope this problem can be fixed.....soon.",1444176000,5,569,4.135135135135135
7420316,5,B014Q67MVI,"""Hawk's Eyes"" is the highlight of season 3 in an overall great season. Susan has to make a life and death decision that conflicts with her deeply held convictions. Too bad Twitter wasn't around in the 1980s. Fans might have saved the show and it would have had a much deserved longer run. Read my interview with Urich at https://paralleluniverseatlarge.wordpress.com/2015/03/06/actor-robert-urich-made-a-difference/",1443139200,,415,5.933333333333334
7420317,5,B014Q67MVI,"Just the other day,I was thinking we'd have to wait a whole year between Season 2 & Season 3.
I'm sooo glad they didn't make us wait so long for Season 3!
Now if they can just also re-release the Movie Collection at a REASONABLE PRICE?",1441843200,8,235,4.130434782608695
7420318,5,B014Q67MVI,"This is a three season series that should have lasted longer. Gritty action, fresh crisp dialogue and Boston scenery make this series a must see.
Robert Urich, Avery Brooks, Barbara Stock and cast were made to order for this series. There are some differences between the characters in the book and in the series, but each actor manages to bring their characters to life. I could not see anyone else in the roles of Spenser, Hawk, Susan, Marty, Frank and Rita. I was much younger when this series started and thirty plus years later the stories are still powerful and relevant. This is because of brilliant writing, directing, and brilliant acting. The rarely spoken of friendship, ""kinship by trials"" of Spenser and Hawk is in some ways Shakespearean and most certainly legendary for anyone who was and is a true fan of this powerful, sometimes light hearted drama. For those who were too young to remember Spenser: For Hire or those who have never seen it you are in for an experience. I myself look forward to enjoying the adventures though bittersweet for some of the cast are no longer here. They left behind them solid performances to be proud of. As you watch this series I hope  you will agree with this review also. Spenser has an extraordinary spirit for seeking out the truth, the right and wrong. And when the right or wrong was too complicated he let his instincts and fate determine court justice or the finality of swift justice. You will not be disappointed.",1441411200,34,1474,4.713178294573644

7420322,5,B014Q67MVI,"Great entertainment.  But I continue to wonder how the actress for Susan Silverman got cast.  She is awful.  Too bad Rita Fiore didn't stay with the program.  Avery Brooks rocks, and is by far the best actor on the show.  His understated performance is transcendental.",1486252800,,268,4.866666666666666

7420329,5,B014Q67MVI,Absolutely loved this show when it aired!! The real crime was it was only for 3 seasons. GREAT portrayals by The late Robert Urich and the welll accomplished Avery Brooks. It was series ending that led me to the novels that inspired the TV show.,1475971200,,245,4.466666666666667

7420334,5,B014Q67MVI,"The Best of all three seasons.  Spenser: For Hire was the best TV show of all time!  It was also a great detective series and the only thing I hated about the show was that it only lasted three seasons.  This show ended way too soon!  Robert Urich played a great ""Spenser"", arguably the greatest role he ever played.  I have to say the same about Avery Brooks as ""Hawk"".  His portrayal of Benjamin Sisko in ST: DS9 was close to perfection at times, but I felt the writers, producers, and directors held Brooks' talents back quite a bit sometimes.  Both Spenser and Hawk were very complex characters and terribly difficult to cast -- but they pulled it off!  Robert B. Parker broke the mold when he created Hawk.  The chemistry between Spenser, Hawk, and Susan was unbelievable!  I can't say enough about the entire cast.  Ron McClarty as Sgt. Belson, Richard Jaekel as Lt. Quirk, Barbara Stock as Susan Silverman, and Carolyn McCormick as Rita Fiore, they all deserve a great deal of praise for their work.  My favorite episode was ""Play it again, Sammy.""  A little over the top at times maybe, but it was excellent.  Also, ""Substantial Justice"" is a close second for me, and ""Child's Play"" an extremely close third.  I also liked ""My enemy, my friend"" and others -- in fact, I could list ALL the episodes of season 3, but it would not be necessary.  On a scale of 1-10 I rate this show a 100!  Thank you, Robert B. Parker, and thank you, John Wilder for bringing it to television.",1469232000,2,1481,4.48689138576779

7420344,5,B014Q67MVI,"Great crime series starring legendary actors Robert Urich & Avery Brooks set in and around Boston, MA in the late 1980s.

One would think that after making fans wait for so long they would create a product that works without skipping hundreds of times in a single episode.

7420347,5,B014Q67MVI,"Not enough seasons. Too bad. Also loved Spenser speeding around Boston in car chases. Being from Boston, and around, it tickled me to see those - in reality, no way in the city could any of those chases happen.  The original gridlock city - and that was BEFORE the Big Dig. Also some nostalgia. Boston Garden is gone, some of the sites played the part of others (like the Grist mill at the Wayside Inn supposedly being somewhere in the Berkshires in one episode.
Enjoyable, but leaves you wanting more.",1462924800,2,502,4.5777777777777775

7420380,2,B014Q67MVI,"It started out pretty good and while they used Robert Parker characters they did NOT use Robert Parkers stories....nor did they
keep the same character traits, there should have been more of Parkers humor, the banter between Spenser and Hawk was
missing, Susan came off as a kind of dim-wit rather then a Harvard PHD with a marvelous wit as Parker had portrayed her.
There was marvelous banter and sexual innuendu between Spenser and Rita Fiore in Parkers books but that was missing
here.  The story plots were complex and hard to follow and very unlike anything Parker had written.  Avery Brooks was
VERY good as Hawk which was about the only thing good about this series....although he dressed well in the Parker
books, wonderful casual clothes, in the series here he was dressed to the nines in suit and tie most of the time.  I dont
ever remember him dressed that way in Parkers books....this could have been a 5 star series and ran a long time if
they had followed Parkers books a lot more closely in story lines and character renditions.  I was disappointed.",1453248000,,1064,4.67379679144385

7420397,4,B014Q67MVI,"Spenser For Hire: The Complete Third Season stars Robert Urich as the Boston private detective whos not only well read, but is a gourmet cook, an ex-boxer, and former Boston policeman. Operating out of a converted firehouse, this modern-day Renaissance man drives around in a vintage Mustang solving crimes and looking after those who want some class with their private investigating. His main street contact is Hawk (Avery Brooks), a tall menacing black man who operates on both sides of the law, and Sgt. Frank Belson (Ron McLarty) is Spensers chief contact in the Boston Police Department.

The third and final season (1987-1988) finds Spensers independent minded love interest, Susan Silverman (Barbara Stock), returning from the West Coast determined to work out their differences. Spensers longtime friend and valued ally in the Boston PD, Lt. Martin Quick (Richard Jaeckel), gets sidelined with a heart condition, but Hawk and Sgt. Belson are still on hand to cover his back. Spensers cases this season see him providing shuttle diplomacy between a judge and a gangster, tackling sexual harassment within a college university, solving a murder in old Plymouth during Thanksgiving, and revisiting the case thats been haunting him for years  the case that cost him his police career. Guest stars include Samuel L. Jackson, E.G. Marshall, Ving Rhames, Andie MacDowell, William Hickey, Philip Bosco, Shirley Knight, and Giancarlo Esposito.
