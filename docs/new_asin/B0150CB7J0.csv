In this story he is trying to find a way he can express to the world the suffering of this people, his own suffering, the ecological abuse to his homeland, his stolen country.

The Tibetans have been tortured, murdered, beaten, raped, self-immolation, humiliated, devalued, and many more things.

There has as been no justice.  No answers.  No remorse from the brutal and barbaric Chinese politicians and Chinese military.

I think about 1.2 millions, if not more, Tibetans have lost their lives.  Genocide.  Lost their home, their country...

These we watch and hear about, but we do not know what it is to live that life.

My compassion and sympathy to all Tibetans, and all peoples across the world who suffer at the hands of others.

Loten, after meeting the Dalai Lama, does find his way from from seeking an independent Tibet to a middle way approach to Tibet that is realistic and peaceful, and he accepts this and supports the Dalai Lama.

As a devoted father who values his children and raises them with the Tibetan culture and values.",1521504000,,1244,4.752336448598131

8732225,4,B0150CB7J0,This movie is about one tibetan exiled soul that lives in Switzerland and has not lost his heart and his commitment to his culture and has been drawing attention to the problematic and unresolved issues of his homeless nation.  I liked to see the human in him and how he definitely tries all that is in his power to get people involved.  I did not expect this kind of warrior.,1467072000,,376,4.357142857142857
