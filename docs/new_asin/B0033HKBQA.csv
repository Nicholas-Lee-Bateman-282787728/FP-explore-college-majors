4065356,4,B0033HKBQA,I didn't realize from the picture that I had already seen this movie.  It was very imaginative and very well done but since it was a play  it lacked the drama that I had expected from a movie though it was very well done!,1418688000,2,221,4.0
4065357,5,B0033HKBQA,"Loved the feeling of a play in a off-Broadway scenario, with a great sound and acting. I recommend it to those who appreciate plays more than a movie, since this is a clever combination of both",1414800000,3,193,4.388888888888889

4065359,1,B0033HKBQA,"It was not what I thought is was going to be. It is theater on stage, not a movie. Watched maybe 2 minutes of it. Very disappointing that there is a lack of description and no preview on the page before you buy it or I would not have purchased it.",1412726400,4,247,3.8627450980392157

4065364,4,B0033HKBQA,"First of all, it's basically a photographed stage play, though it's all done in a studio (with neutral backdrops and extremely minimal scenery), not in a theatre in front of an audience. If that turns you off, okay, but it's hardly unprecedented.

Apart from that annoying clarinet, I quite like it. It's a nice to see the Wedekind play done straight (though liberties are taken, names are anglicized and marks become dollars), not to take anything away from the musical ""Spring's Awakening.""

Although the attitude towards sex education may have changed, and our mores, and the amount of information available to children, human nature has not. The way the people grope for answers and try to understand their own feelings and impulses and physicality is timeless.

The acting under Seidelman's direction is very good. Jesse Lee Soffer is very charismatic, Constance Towers is excellent. Bridget Moloney does wonderful things with her little part. There is some tasteful and artistically justified nudity, none of it full frontal.

A clever idea of Seidelman's is to have the teachers (but not the headmaster) in the faculty meeting where Michael is expelled wear carnival masks. It allows them to be doubled (which one senses they are) by the young actors playing the students and thereby adds an extra dimension to the caricatures they basically are.

But over all, the spareness of the production, the fact that it focuses on the generations in the way it does, and the English names and places (New Hampshire is actually mentioned) cause it to dialogue with ""Our Town."" It becomes the more unflinching cousin of the Wilder play. The dead even come back.",1269648000,21,1658,5.014545454545455

8387945,2,B0033HKBQA,"Wow. It was certainly artistic, and not what I expected. Reminded me of an 80's expressionism piece. I love the show... this was a bizarre new light to see it from. I don't even know where to begin.",1503187200,,198,4.2368421052631575

8387949,4,B0033HKBQA,"I was actually in a production of this play years ago, for good or for ill.  I played the minister who condemns a boy who committed suicide to hell.  I also played one of the boys in the reform school.  This is a good tv production of a unique and strange play, to say the least.  German playwright Frank Wenedkind wrote this play in 1891 and because it's subject matter--teenage sexuality and suicide--it was banned for 15 years.  In 1906 it was produced but only for one night and then was banned.  Overall, the play is a little uneven, but it does have its powerful moments.  The interaction between the boys are good.  The characters are supposed to be about 14 or 15, but are obviously played by older actors in their late teens or early 20's.  I thought the acting was good in this production.  They changed the ending slightly, which was a little disappointing.  But overall, it's a good production.",1468195200,,906,4.530864197530864
