5734150,4,B00CPTUN8S,"Does this DVD have the episode with Robert Duvall called ""Miniature""?  It seems like the ""complete "" 4th season would have more episodes than this says it has.",1399852800,,159,4.678571428571429

5734152,5,B00CPTUN8S,"I've been watching the entire series on the SyFy channel, but they don't seem to be showing any Season 4 shows.  That's probably because Season 4 episodes were an hour long versus 30 minutes for the other seasons.  It's all here.  Now that I'm done watching it, I'll donate the DVD set to the local library and take a tax deduction.",1393545600,,332,4.409836065573771
5734153,5,B00CPTUN8S,"Once again, some of the best TV ever. Love Rod Serling's monologues. Each story has a message;Sometimes sad, sometimes humorous, but always thought provoking.",1392854400,,158,5.625
5734154,3,B00CPTUN8S,"Started this tape off with the long coveted ""New Exhibit"". I remember seeing this long ago and actually bragging to people how suspenseful it was. Forget it. This disc has critical bits and pieces edited out which left the episode watered down and lifeless. The brother in law knocking on the door repeatedly, calling to Martin while he's doing the burial deed, Martin nervous and not knowing what to do, is gone, along with a few other parts here and there. If I noticed it from this clip, I wonder about the others.",1388966400,5,517,4.56989247311828
5734155,5,B00CPTUN8S,"in a rocks glass. No muss. No fuss. No extras. Just pure unadulterated spookiness and unsubtle social commentary without the ice, mixers, garnish, special guest appearances, or commercial breaks. Well, maybe a word or two from our sponsor before the chain-smoking Rod Serling tosses out a teaser about next week's episode. Good Lord, he might even mention the name of the writer! That's the way it was in '50s/'60s TV. And Twilight Zone was among the best of the lot. Still is.

Go ahead. Treat yourself to a marathon of little boys wishing their enemies into the corn field, nuclear worldwide war paranoia, troubled men longing for bygone days of idyllic youth, and troubled women longing for -- or desperate to avoid -- perverted beauty. You may never want to get on a plane again. Even the devil himself-- well, I won't spoil it for you.

The episodes appear in their original broadcast order. For my money, the best years were the first season and the fourth (the only hour-long episodes), but feel free to disagree. Yeah, there are a few clunkers in there, but go ahead and buy all five seasons. You know you want to.",1381968000,6,1122,4.690355329949239
5734156,4,B00CPTUN8S,"Some people never take old sayings to heart until it's too late. While in the midst of watching the fourth season of ""The Twilight Zone,"" the proverb ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" came to mind. The perfect 30-minute format of the show was stretched to an hour to fill in the time another show left open. ""Stretched"" is exactly how this season of the classic television show feels.

Don't get me wrong. ""The Twilight Zone's"" fourth season is still quality television. The stories are entertaining and still have the great twists audiences expect from the show. The extended running time just leaves viewers with a sense that a bit of fluff had to be added to each episode. Rod Serling said it best when asked about the extended time slot.

""Ours is the perfect half-hour show... If we went to an hour, we'd have to fleshen our stories, soap opera style. Viewers could watch fifteen minutes without knowing whether they were in a 'Twilight Zone' or 'Desilu Playhouse,'"" Serling stated about the change.

All 18 episodes of ""The Twilight Zone's"" fourth season are included in this 5-disc set. Every episode features a guest star that either went on to bigger and better things in Hollywood or were already established actors. There are appearances by Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall, Bill Bixby, and James Doohan to name a few.

Although Rod Serling handles the bulk of the scripts for the different episodes, other highly regarded writers contributed their talents. Richard Matheson (""I Am Legend,"" ""What Dreams May Come"") and Charles Beaumont (""The Masque of the Red Death,"" ""The Intruder"") both returned and filled in the gaps left by Serling. Earl Hamner, Jr. (""The Waltons,"" ""Falcon Crest"") and Reginald Rose (""Twelve Angry Men"") also came on board to take over writing duties when Beaumont left the show because of a sickness.

""The Twilight Zone: The Complete Fourth Season"" is a great collection of the only hour-long episodes of the famous anthology series. Each segment is cleaned up and the video and audio restored. The stories might feel a bit stretched at times, but their overall delivery of shocks in the end make up for that.",1376524800,17,2155,4.877049180327869

8584825,5,B00CPTUN8S,"I purchased this 5DVD set of Season Four of the original Twilight Zone series especially for one episode that scared me silly as a kid.  I grew up hearing all kinds of stories & legends about Italy from my grandmother, so a particular favorite Twilight Zone episode is Jess-Belle (the name is a play on Jezebel from the Bible), Anne Francis is great as the scheming Jess, wearing a brunette wig to go along with her dark character.  She plays a poor mountain girl who goes to a witch to cast a love spell on a straying boyfriend, but with no money to pay the witch, she must pay her in another form - turning into a murderous wildcat at the stroke of midnight.
