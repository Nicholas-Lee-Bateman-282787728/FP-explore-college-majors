8295925,5,B001E181ZU,Glad to see this DVD is on the market. I tried to buy it last year but no copies were available. This year it came in time for Christmas. We have enjoyed the coverage. It is all about the tennis without much fluff. It is also great to hear the match with european announcers. They did a great job.,1420156800,,297,4.0508474576271185

8295927,5,B001E181ZU,"Pete Sampras broke the record for Grand Slam titles in this 4 set war with the Aussie Pat Rafter in 2000. Pistol Pete was playing with a shin injury and his philosophy in this match,where his win gave him 7 Wimbledon crowns, was to win at all costs. Definitely one of the more memorable matches of his 16 year career on the WTA tour.",1393718400,,333,4.21875
8295928,5,B001E181ZU,"If you are a tennis lover you have to see this video. You can't find a perfect volley lesson video anywhere. But Rafter is a volley master in this video. Wathch him, learn that... I don't need to talk abaut Sampras who is a Trademark.",1280534400,,234,4.222222222222222
8295929,4,B001E181ZU,"As a huge Rafter fan, I taped this match off NBC-TV that day and have since transferred it to DVD. I will appreciate the near-HD quality of this Kultur production. (I own 5 other Classic Wimbledon (Kultur) matches)

Two of the greatest, all-courters go at it here.  The athleticism, quickness and precision volleying of Rafter-Sampras are abilities rarely seen in today's professional tennis. Except for R.Federer, of course.

The swashbuckling Rafter has Sampras on the ropes ahead 4-2 in the 2nd set tiebreaker when Patrick later admitted that he ""chokes"" the only time in his Hall of Fame career.  Sampras senses it and goes on to roll him after that critical moment.

4 stars because this is a good, solid final; not one of the greatest matches ever, not even close.",1224028800,,770,4.847328244274809
