This one was a little more intensity than Smooth Grooves. I love Smooth Grooves, and so does my mom. This is one workout tape where we do not feel intimated by other people with nice bodies already.

She dances as well on this one, so I have to wait to build my metabolism and intensity to do this one again. I borrowed it from the library years ago...but did purchase Smooth Grooves by her on her website

I also have Soul Stretch which I love dearly too.

She has great enthusiasm & so does her 2 female & 1 male backup dancers who look like people in your neighborhood. The only thing is she never breaks anything down, never slows down, she never stops which is great for people in great shape, only maybe counts once in a while. Her backup show diff intensities which is great, but by the time she calls the move, she's doing it already. She does repeat the same moves & small routines so by the end you will probably have caught up, but I do need a breakdown.
The music instrumental versions of very recent hits to keep you going & energized.
The warmup is only 2 minutes of fast head rolls, hip rolls & curling your back.
The 34 min cardio is mambos, grapevines, box steps, butterflies, fast step touching, jumping jacks, African dance, shuffles, horse riding move, squats, hopping, jogging, voguing, etc. She has a great style & shows you how to get in touch with your creative side when doing it.
The cool down is 8 min of slow high kicks, squats, slower dancing, lunges, etc.
Lastly is 10 min of floor work of crunches & other ab work, leg stretches, yoga spinal twists, etc.
This is a great DVD for those in great shape who already know how to dance well & keep up a fast pace.

8063920,5,B0009NZ75Q,"If you like to dance and you enjoy getting your cardio workout while having fun, this is the DVD for you.  Althea is an upbeat, funny instructor who helps keep you motivated throughout the workout.  The workout itself is a funky hip-hop style dance that never slows down.  She has two back-ups in the studio--neither is a svelte model type; both are middle-aged, and one demos easier moves for beginners. The only drawback to the DVD is that Althea moves quickly from move to move without breaking them down or half timing them. However, I danced years ago and do many dance/fitness DVD's and was able to catch on quickly. You'll be sweating by the end of the hour!",1150416000,2,665,4.571428571428571
