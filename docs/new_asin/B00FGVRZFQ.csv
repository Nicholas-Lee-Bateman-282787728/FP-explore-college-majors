The unique fundamental difference between this DVD, and the rest of Nixon's biographies, on DVD, etc, is that this puts Nixon under a different light, and also his cabinet members. Very different from what we are used to seeing/watching about Nixon. I am 34 yrs. of age. I love politics, but I love Nixon more...I highly recommend this DVD to anyone. As soon as the opening title began, w/ a song by Tracey Ullman, I knew I had something special, very special. This is just a totally different depiction. God bless Nixon, Chapin, Haldeman, and Ehrlichman! I wish I could have met all of them. Good, hard working men. Real men. Buy it!!",1399075200,3,648,4.692982456140351
5991798,5,B00FGVRZFQ,Informative DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history of politics. It had a really good storyline in very good footage from that time in history,1396051200,,169,4.483870967741935
5991799,5,B00FGVRZFQ,"I was a 60's kid and remember when Nixon was forced out of office for Watergate. This movie is a trip back in time. What is amazing is both watching people of my generation in the crowds and the reactions to Nixon working the crowd. It's also interesting listening to the tapes which are played as voice over on some of the film. (With subtitles so you can understand it.)

Now of course looking back, he wasn't as bad as certain other more recent presidents who got us into undeclared wars, started us on this massive debt spending etc etc.. And the bits with Daniel Ellsburg and Nixon's reaction remind me of Edward Snowdon. The film doesn't go into how a guy who campaigned on getting the USA out of Vietnam could let the war drag on for another 5 years. Nor does it cover his ""war on drugs"" which is on the tapes as being a way to disrupt the liberal left and the black leaders by arresting them on drug charges.  It also doesn't cover his creation of HMO's and part of the reason health care is still as messed up as it is now. (See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sicko-HD/dp/B009TGO43A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sicko [HD</a>] which has those tape clips in it.)

This film is home clips with the tapes and it's great. It's like looking at movies of your own family if you happened to have a dad who was president of the USA.

I also can't get that opening song out my head either... Tracy Ulman's ""They Don't know about ...""

Still a complex man done in by an act of unnecessary criminality, he would have won in 1972 without the dirty tricks. Although it might have been different if Muskie wasn't eliminated early and that was one of the things CREEP worked on.",1395187200,,1714,4.643564356435643
5991800,5,B00FGVRZFQ,"I had a very minor position in the Nixon White House and found this film an accurate evocation of an intense and tragic time. Nixon emerges as a man of political daring, if not brilliance, who was ultimately revealed as morally bankrupt.  A sad tale and one we need to remember.  I am impressed that the filmmakers were yet not born during Watergate, yet seem to understand it by some sort of osmosis.",1395014400,4,401,4.47945205479452
5991801,5,B00FGVRZFQ,"Using super 8 movies taken by ""the president's men"" was a uniquely creative yet effective  way to tell the complicated story of Watergate. I still,can't get the theme song ""They don't know about us,"" out of my head!",1392854400,3,215,4.657894736842105
8615638,5,B00FGVRZFQ,My favorite film on President Nixon and his embattled administration of such good and & gifted people. Thank you very much.,1527379200,,123,4.904761904761905
8615639,5,B00FGVRZFQ,See the inside of the most powerful cult in American history as well as the critics who were seduced to live under the fascination of its spell. Fans of the weird as well as the wired (I hope that joke does not bug you) will be blown away as if by napalm jelly dropped from heaven by the footage and the testimony and the sheer magnitude of the implications that this small group of men had and continue to have on the national consciousness.,1500336000,,442,4.273809523809524
8615640,5,B00FGVRZFQ,A wonderful film recorded by the men who were there.,1499472000,,52,4.3
8615641,5,B00FGVRZFQ,This movie is stunning in how powerful and often darkly hilarious the Nixon presidency really was. A must-see for Watergate buffs and pop historians.,1482710400,,149,5.25
8615642,5,B00FGVRZFQ,Excellent documentary with objective comments from those closest to the president.  Nixon was a great leader and statesman who was victimized by a bunch of partisan politicians that were looking for any reason to get him out of office.  Watergate was a misdemeanor compared to what the Clintons have done over the past 25+ years.,1481414400,,329,4.963636363636364
8615643,3,B00FGVRZFQ,"This was an interesting documentary for those of us who didn't live the sixties and Watergate drama. I really was surprised that the tone of the documentary was harsh towards Nixon as a person, but I guess it's realistic and more suited in a historical manner than a hagiography. Nixon never pardoned his team that worked day and night to put him in the White House and get him the information he needed on the opposition (Watergate hotel break-in) for victory in the 1972 election. Apparently that love was not reciprocated. Those seeking more information on Nixon from a foreign policy perspective (as I did) will not find it here. There are moments of lightness and fun, all under a sheen of secrecy and gloom. A preview of what a HRC presidency would look like.",1477612800,,765,4.674074074074074
8615644,5,B00FGVRZFQ,great,1445472000,,5,5.0
8615645,1,B00FGVRZFQ,Penny Lane is a charlatan - I dislike Nixon's behavior and his track record as much as the rest of us -- but my problem is learning more about this director. Penny Lane is a paid charlatan from the right wing to pretend that she is from the left wing hammering against Nixon. She also thinks the twin towers via 9/11 were blown up by ufos from outer space - she's an internet troll and a lunatic sociopath - this film displays more than equally as such.  Stay away.,1422921600,,465,4.224719101123595
8615646,3,B00FGVRZFQ,"As I write this in 2014, April marks twenty years since Richard M. Nixon died and August observes the fortieth anniversary of his resignation from the presidency. I won't be the last to note the 2013 documentary OUR NIXON, a collection of home movies of America's 37th president shot by White House aides Dwight Chapin, John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman.

Chapin, the only one still alive, sits for OUR NIXON. Old interviews about their time serving Nixon give Ehrlichman and Haldeman their say. While a ringside seat for Richard Nixon and his staff letting their hair down is not to be missed, audio of some of his secretly taped conversations reveals as much in words as any actions we see.",1402012800,,692,4.766666666666667
8615647,5,B00FGVRZFQ,"Having seen other DVD (and videos) on the life of Richard Nixon, this one was quite different but interesting.  It were moving pictures taken by other prominent White House staff members that were showing what their history was like while making it at the same time.",1399420800,,266,4.782608695652174
