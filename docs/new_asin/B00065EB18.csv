2168677,3,B00065EB18,it would be better if cartoon fish were mixed with the real fish for my 3 yr old girls. they don't like the classical cd with it.  should be more fun modern music,1201824000,,162,3.909090909090909
2168678,5,B00065EB18,My Granddaughter age 2 loves to watch fish.  She loves to watch before she goes to bed.,1199664000,,87,4.117647058823529
2168679,3,B00065EB18,"While it is a Baby Genius CD it in no way compares with Favorite Nursery Rhymes and Favorite Children Songs which is the best, after getting all the Baby Genius CD's I would save my money on this one as it is not able to really keep their attention for very long, not much in the way of children interaction like some of the other's, maybe ok for younger children, our grand daughter was 18 months when she got it and she watched it the first time and didn't make it through the entire CD before she was bored with it.",1185408000,,518,4.138613861386139
2168680,3,B00065EB18,"Would be much better if after each segment the screen didn't cut to black.  I know this is so that you can decide if the next segment will be too long for the baby to pay attention, but on DVD's you could just select a section.  There is no menu to do that with though.  My baby doesn't really like it because everytime she gets interested, the section ends, cuts to black and she looses interest.  She does like the music CD that came with it though.",1169164800,,451,4.149425287356322
2168681,1,B00065EB18,My 2-year-old daughter is not interested in this at all.  There are very few shots of children.  It is mostly animals swimming around and does nothing to hold her interest.,1168992000,,172,4.7
2168682,5,B00065EB18,My child really loved this DVD. Every baby genius dvd we have gotten him he has loved! I don't really like him watching anything else!,1162425600,,134,4.4
2168683,5,B00065EB18,"My son is 9 months and he is captivated every time I play this, or any of the 3 Baby Genuis DVDs we have. I have watched it with him and I think the reason it is so engaging is that the scene changes about every 5 seconds, which is about how long a baby's attention span is. It also has characters popping up in front of the screen, and it intrigues him enough to wait to see if someone or something (a character or a letter, etc.) pops up again.

It's great when I fix dinner or get ready in the morning! I even catch my 6 year old and her friends getting sucked into it as they play. I have bought a couple other videos for him by other producers and none of them hold his attention for more than 3 minutes. This line of DVD's definitely works for us!",1146355200,4,753,3.9539473684210527
2168684,5,B00065EB18,"Music calms the soul.  I personally like the no talking aspect of the DVD and only music. I can play this in my classroom with the volume turned down low and just let it play. I leave this DVD playing during our ocean unit. While the students are enjoying centers and activities, this DVD is playing. It is engaging because it is soothing the mind; while giving the students time to enjoy the centers without having to stop and look for a plot in a movie. So really this DVD should read enjoyable at all ages. This is only my opinion.",1142380800,3,534,4.287128712871287
2168685,5,B00065EB18,I would not have written except for the mom who gave it 1 star.  That is so unfair.  My very busy and hard to get his attention 16 month old boy really loves this video.  He stares at the tv and loves the song at the end.  It is really worth it to get this one.  I promise!,1139097600,3,273,3.6379310344827585
2168686,1,B00065EB18,"I had purchased this DVD for learning purposes. I had hoped there would be more education associated with this title. There is a very nice classical music score. As far as the actual content of the DVD, there is the title with the name of the animal then live action video showing the animal. There is no voice-over.

My son was not engaged at 16 months.

In my opinion, nice but not educational.",1127520000,3,396,4.410958904109589
2168687,3,B00065EB18,"this is not entertaining enough for my 16 month old because it's not cartoonish and not very colorful either. it's a mix of real life people and cartoons, something lie sesame street, perfect for older kids but not for a squirmy 16 month old",1363305600,,241,4.5
2168688,1,B00065EB18,I have 3 other baby genius movies & my 21 mo falls asleep to them all the time b/c they are actually singing videos whereas this one plays classical music instead of actual toddler word songs,1362700800,,191,4.333333333333333
2168689,5,B00065EB18,His original one was broke so he is very happy to have this new DVD.  He enjoys watching it every day.,1354492800,,102,3.857142857142857
2168690,1,B00065EB18,"Not at all like the other DVD's put out by Baby Genius such as Baby Animals, Counting Songs, ABC's, etc...this is simply a bunch of sea animals swimming around to boring music and an occasional pop in by the Baby Genius characters. My little boy expressed zero interest in this DVD after about 7 minutes.",1339718400,,304,4.545454545454546
2168691,3,B00065EB18,"I have other videos by baby genius and I think they are more engaging.  This video of underwater images and lots of fish and sea life but it's set to classical music and as an adult I thought it was boring. My daughter (2 year old) likes sea life and watched the colorful displays.  It was very calming for her.  I think she liked it.  It might be good for end of the day watching to settle down, but for parents it can be boring.",1330646400,,430,4.023529411764706
2168692,1,B00065EB18,"This DVD came as part of a 6 DVD set.  So far, this one is the worst.  It bored me and my 11-month old son.  In short, there is classical music that plays while ocean creatures swim around.  I am happy that I did not pay for this one separately.  Hopefully, he will appreciate it more when he is older; but I doubt it.",1326672000,,318,3.90625
2168693,5,B00065EB18,"My daughter is 5 mos and is very taken by this tranquil DVD. If you are looking for something soothing for night, this is it!!",1324512000,,126,4.08
2168694,5,B00065EB18,"whether you need to put the baby down for awhile to do some chores or need help calming before bed or nap time...this dvd is great! the music is great for adults who are doing stuff around the house while the little one is being entertained too! its great that it not just cartoon stupidness and actually is fun, engaging, and semi educational with numbers, letters, animals, and music.",1315353600,,386,4.608695652173913
2168695,2,B00065EB18,"""This dvd is not like the others I've purchased (Children's Songs, Nursery Rhymes, Baby Animals). It played classical music for the first 5 - 10 minutes and just showed fish swimming. Did not keep the attention of my 17-month old. What she enjoys most about the Baby Genius videos is the singing and the real children acting/dancing. She'll watch some of them two times through but not this one.""",1305158400,,396,4.753623188405797
2168696,5,B00065EB18,"My son has loved this since the first time he seen it on cable on demand. I am so glad I bought it! The video is shots of actual fish and aquatic animals set to classical music. it does have some cartoon characters but they are not the focus. this is a very soothing dvd and my son, who is now 18 months, still is captivated by it!",1267228800,,331,3.8823529411764706
8038811,1,B00065EB18,This DVD was so scratched it crashed my DVD player twice.  What a disappointment.,1492992000,,81,4.785714285714286
8038812,1,B00065EB18,This DVD was slightly disappointing. I have others made by baby genius that were very amazing. This one was lack luster and my seven month old didn't appreciate it.,1466899200,,164,4.689655172413793
8038813,5,B00065EB18,Happy,1458864000,,5,5.0
8038814,1,B00065EB18,CD came scratched!! Some chapters won't even play because the DVD player cannot read them. So irritating,1456444800,,104,5.176470588235294
8038815,5,B00065EB18,"We LOVE Baby Genius, and Underwater Adventures is no exception!  It brings all of our toddlers favorite animated characters and introduces them to ""Underwater"" world.  The music is very peaceful and soothing - we have found this is a great DVD to help the kids wind down in the evenings.

The wonderful things about Baby Genius is that it engages our children but is also very educational.  We recommend this to all of our family and friends with small children!",1454544000,,462,4.7375
8038816,5,B00065EB18,"I absolutely love this DVD and buy it for every baby shower I attend.  When my kids were little (i had twins) I would get so tired I couldn't handle it and I had bought this for the music because it is suppose to be great for kids to listen to, one day I popped it in the DVD player and my kids were hooked. They loved it so much. They would actually sit in their swings and watch it. I started using it occasionally when I was really burnt out. Now a days people rely on technology so much to keep their kids entertained its probably normal to pop them in front of the tv. I got this back in 2007 and we really weren't much of tech people so I felt funny having my kids watch it. They were like 1.5 years old. Not really what you do with kids that age... But it really was a life saver for me.",1433376000,,794,3.871165644171779

8038818,3,B00065EB18,"My son LOVES this movie.  That being said, the fact that they have a section called ""Seals"" and then show only sea lions drives me insane!  There is a very easy way to tell the difference.  Sea lions have external ears.  Seals have what looks like holes in the side of their head.  So, I let my son watch this since he loves it so much, and now I need to make sure he knows the difference since this video is wrong.",1400284800,,415,4.012195121951219
8038819,1,B00065EB18,not what I expected.just a 30 minute video of watching fish swimming with music that's not appealing. Not sure who this would entertain,1387238400,,135,4.913043478260869
8038820,2,B00065EB18,"I read an Amazon review that said Baby Genius was so much better than Bab Einstein.
My year old grand daughter loves the puppets and music with Baby Einstein so I thought I'd try Baby Genius.
I ordered Underwater Adventures and Baby Animals Favorite Sing Alongs. She completely lost interest after a few minutes.
I tried again with the same results. She LOVES most of the Baby Einstein---will try these again when she is older to see if catches her attention.",1374451200,,459,4.679012345679013
