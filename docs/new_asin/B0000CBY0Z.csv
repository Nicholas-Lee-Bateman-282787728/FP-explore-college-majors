1918353,1,B0000CBY0Z,"I thought this was a B movie when I rented it, so I wasn't expecting a LOT.  But this movie was still disappointing!
Silly looking creatures in the special effects department didn't help, the VERY loud music which covered up a lot of the conversations REALLY didn't help,  but the plot was the main problem.
It started off okay, the plot I mean, but 2/3 of the way through it got ridiculous.  And I have to say, at the point I realized the ""heroine"" and her x hubby were aiding and abetting the very enemy who was currently in  the process of destroying the human race, I lost all desire to finish the viewing.
I did finish watching,however,  but nothing was done to correct this unbelievable ERROR.  At the end, we are supposed to be happy about their accomplishments, even though it meant the earth's destruction eventually.  BIZARRE....
Is this a new wave of science fiction.. where wiping out the EARTH is a GOOD thing????
If you have to watch this, I recommend watching it on an old TV set.  At the end, you'll probably want to throw something at the screen.",1072915200,20,1063,4.5

Well, filmgoers, what's happening is that eels, yes, that's right, EELS are planning the eventual and inevitable take-over of Planet Earth.  Chomsky wants to put an end to the eels, Fletcher wants to learn from them and Raines wants Fletcher back and Chomsky to quit hassling the poor critters.

1918436,4,B0000CBY0Z,"I've seen the bad reviews for this movie and while it's not a high budget flick, I still found myself enjoying it a lot.  I liked what they did with the ""aliens"", I liked what they did with the Hubris, and although I hated Dr. Chomsky and kept wanting him to die a horrible death, what they did was tolerable (not being more specific as I don't want to give away any spoilers although I am sure the ones who disliked the movie would say I couldn't spoil it).  The special effects weren't too bad although the water floods were too obviously not real.  I also liked how the ""eels"" were created - what they did with them throughout the movie.

So....if you watch it, you may think it sucks too, but as for me.  I'd watch it again.
YMMV",1380240000,,733,4.207142857142857
1918437,4,B0000CBY0Z,Liked the premise of Aliens deciding the fate of the world.  One man was able to show that the world should not be destroyed based on a few.,1379203200,,140,4.0
1918438,4,B0000CBY0Z,"The production values were enjoyably high in this movie. The special effects worked well and didn't interfere with the flow of the movie. The acting was superb. I was especially impressed with the bad guy. He had a great deal of presence on the screen and as another review said, you wanted to beat him in the face. Great job.

Now for the negatives. The writing was ABYSMAL. The writers evidently got their character profiles from saturday morning cartoons. They took a great story line and fed it into a blender to make as generic and bland as possible. These are obviously failed TV sitcom writers who used family to get a job on this picture. Then there was the inappropriate boy girl sex scene just as she was about to finish the code and save mankind. Oh-- and let's not forget the personal dialog just as they were about to launch the mini sub. That is just what I would have been thinking about at that moment. I would say the writers were two, possibly three middle aged female accountants who used personal financial information to blackmail the producer into letting them write the script. That is the only possible way these writer were given the great chance that they totally blew. That dialog was right out of an ABC family network sitcom. Meant for teenage girls who aren't listening anyway. It is sad to think of what a great movie they could have had with the same money they spent.

P.S.
I amend this about the writers. Two of them were first time writers, which means they did the typing in order to get their name on a script. According to IMDB neither of them has done anything else in the movie industry since. I wonder why? Phillip J. Roth, who also directed this is also one of the writers, although he had his name removed. He is the guy who has directed 23 cheesy, subclass SYFY channel movies, mostly about pythons and flying shark. He has found his niche and has no regret. You'd think after 23 he would have developed some sense of story, but then it is for SYFY channel, so it isn't really necessary.",1378425600,,2031,4.486486486486487

If you want to see a eel horror movie you should see Razortooth which is a solid movie and is a horror flick which has giant eels eating people and not what this movie has which is nothing but drama. When I bought the movie despite the 2.5 out of 10 it gets on IMDB, I thought it was going to be about people on a submarine which has a leake in the sub and half gets filled with water and the eels go in and have a feast just like Deep Blue Sea(Which I Enjoy Very Much) but I was horribly wrong. The eels don't even eat people, the few deaths in the movie are by electric shock come on I know they are electric eels but really. The acting is bad plus horrible dialogue and bad special effects. The cover is misleading with the eels not even looking like that and nobody scuba dives in the movie unless I received the wrong film.

I hate this movie just for wasting my time I almost cracked the DVD in half. This movie is boring and should be considered a drama and not a sci fi/horror. Do not buy this movie and do not rent this movie, and even if it comes on cable which I seen it before, it should be in your best interest to avoid.",1345507200,8,1281,3.945945945945946

One scientist wants to understand what is going on while another just wants to blow up the trench mindlessly.  guess which one the UN supports?
Well, the heat is actually artificial.  It is being created by an ancient race of eel-like creatures that have awakened to spawn.  They are intelligent.  They think the world belongs to them and not humans.  Can a deal be reached?
Well, at one point the UN, in its infinite wisdom, feels the way to end the heat is by blowing up 50+ 1-megaton nuclear missiles (can you say massive radiation and HEAT?).
There may be a chance of coexisting with the eel-creatures but there is no time to work out the solution now.  But maybe if the creatures hibernate some more, there will be time later for proper communications.
Average effects and moderate acting are added to the odd plot.  Anyone who has followed world events for the past year or two will really wonder at the writers who dreamed up the UN scenarios.  Seems a small group of scientists are making very important decisions without the rest of the UN.  At one point the group actually answers to the President (yeah, right).

Of course, the government once again wants to mess with nature.

It says that it's rated R ""for some violence and language."" However, treat it as a PG-13 film. The language isn't much, and the violent content is very tame. The giant eels electrocute people, but there's no graphic violence with this. There's a guy getting shot that has a little blood. Later, you see a dead guy with a mutilated face. There's some other dead people laying around, but there's very little blood with this. It does, however, have a pretty good pace throughout the film. Directing is may be considered to be poor or decent depending on how much of this low-budget, CGI monster TV movies you watch. There's no good atmosphere or scenery. You'll be looking at the boring walls indoors for most of the film. I'd give it about two and a half stars.
