8291073,2,B001D261Y8,I don't like this and it was a waste of money. Unless you like yoga and ballet then this would be the dvd for you.,1370908800,,114,3.6
8291074,1,B001D261Y8,"This dvd was totally boring and uninventive because so many of the same exercises are on both workouts! What is the point in offering 2 different workouts with 2 different instructors when many of the exercises are exactly the same! There certainly wasn't enough target abdominal toning for me this is a yoga, pilates, ballet combined workout. The most I got from this was a bit of stretching. Waste of money there are much better Ab dvds on the market don't both with this one.",1321228800,,478,4.635294117647059
