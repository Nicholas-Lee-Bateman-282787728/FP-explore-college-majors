This video focuses in on the people whom have spent a certain portion of their lives pursuing specific cryptozoological creatures and some pertinent findings to date regarding the creatures. A little fact and conjecture equal everything except the actual monsters of their pursuit.",1316995200,,722,7.395348837209302
8248956,1,B00133KFIU,"ALL SEGMENTS JUST SHOWED ""INVESTIGATORS"" TRAVELING AROUND BUT NOT REALLY LOOKING/FINDING ANYTHING.  REALLY BORING DVD.  THE SHOW HAD BETTER SEGMENTS.  REALLY,REALLY,REALLY DISAPPOINTING.",1228348800,,186,7.363636363636363
8248957,4,B00133KFIU,"This production leads the viewer into the very real posibility of Cryptids around the planet. You don't get unrealistic hype, but a very sober look at animals curently unknown to science. Every cryptid has eyewitness acounts laid forward in a very matter of fact way. My favourite segment was the Austrailian ""Yowie"" (Bigfoot). Some very creepy moments in the retelling of some of these events. Recommended!",1218585600,5,407,5.181818181818182
8248958,5,B00133KFIU,"Really liked it...think I saw only part of this on TLC or Discovery...took a chance on the DVD, really well done, remote locations, filming and story line.  An educated look into the subject, not corney.  Hope they come out with another one.",1206489600,6,241,4.714285714285714
