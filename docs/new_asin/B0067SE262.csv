""God will forgive my sins"" they think. If you treat others right in the first place you don't need forgiveness. Plus god is an imaginary being that does not exist. Use your brain folks!",1398470400,,347,4.4375
8494415,5,B0067SE262,"This movie entertains as well as informs. There does seem to be a need for people in our country to embrace the fact that there is a growing population of secular-minded people. I feel that ""Godless"" presents a refreshing look at the ""godless"" attitudes of non-theistic individuals. A diverse sampling of people were interviewed in this film: ordinary people, a philosopher, a psychologist, a scientist, and even a former preacher. As one listens to their stories, the reasoning behind their non-theistic beliefs becomes clear. If there was ever a time for greater sympathetic concern and understanding of non-theistic people, it is now in the USA! ""Godless"" artfully conveys these concerns.",1326585600,,691,5.290909090909091
8494416,5,B0067SE262,"This movie does a real good job of summarizing all that is the world of godlessness.  If you live life without god this should be part of your movie collection.  Great interviews from prominent atheists, there is something in there for everyone.  A real down to earth film.",1325721600,2,273,4.645833333333333
8494417,5,B0067SE262,"I can tell you with great certainty that if you buy this movie, it will probably be the best twenty bucks you'll spend this year.

This movie is a wonderful conversation with PZ Meyers, Michael Shermer, Daniel Dennett, Dan Barker, Lawrence Krauss, Stephen Uhl, Margaret Downey, Brian Sapient, James Morrow, Troy Conrad and Geoff Henley.  If that's not enough to get you to cough up the benjamins, I don't know what will.

The synopsis on Amazon doesn't do it justice. Yes, the contents are very true, but what makes this documentary rise above the din is the relaxed and conversational nature of these notable Freethinkers as they respond to questions asked by average, every-day people on the street.  As well, their insights and thoughts on some of the issues that impact unbelievers on a day-to-day bases makes you wish that this movie was a lot longer than the hour and a half run-time it has.

This is not your average documentary, my friends.  Kelli very successfully integrates thought provoking commentary, a good dose of humor and interesting graphical content.  It's not just a stitched-together string of commentary.  These are the personal thoughts and reflections of some of our most outspoken advocates that is weaved together like a fine silk garment by a most talented director.

So, if you have a list of movies that you feel you must buy this year, I strongly suggest that you add this one to your collection.  You'll find yourself watching it over and over, each time learning something new.  I've got my copy nestled neatly on a bookshelf that I reserve for my favorite books and movies, and so you should, too.",1325635200,8,1631,4.830935251798561
8494418,5,B0067SE262,"There are far too many people who are too willing to follow the status quo, to follow the herd and believe what they are told without question. They are easily convinced that other people have privileged access to information about a god that they themselves are denied. Atheists are simply people who say, ""Hold on a minute, that makes no sense. Why would I believe that?"" This movie is a gentle introduction for those who are dissatisfied with the state of our ever increasingly religious world and the division and in-group mentalities that it is creating. Watching the interviews you'll see that it is OK to question unsubstantiated assertions, that it is not necessary to automatically respect absurd beliefs. This movie is an ideal gift for anyone who is finding themselves with unanswered questions about gods and belief. Highly recommended!",1323907200,3,848,5.064285714285714
8494419,5,B0067SE262,"This movie was awesome... it asks real questions of interesting people - questions that I wanted to ask.  It's a movie that you have to keep pausing to think... and chat with your friend about, then start it up again and again.  I also felt that way about Waking Life.  I feel like I've grown having watched this movie; grown in a way that I'm more tolerant and worldly and even more respectful having really listened to and maybe even understood other points of view. If you know someone that is in that questioning space, recommend Godless to them.",1322784000,9,550,4.5353535353535355
