8120216,2,B000FBHFK2,"If you are looking for a hard core adult movie, this is not the one, despite it being labeled an ""uncensored"" movie.  The movie starts with  filming of some landmarks of Budapest, the City. That part is good. It then films the scene at a Budapest Disco. The remaining movie is about two very sexy, attractive young Budapest women, about 19 to 21, who are shown separately in a room by  themselves on a bed.  For about 25 to 30 minutes each, the women take off their clothes and then pleasures themselves. The producer also has out three other movies of bad girls of the World from Europe.  These movies, if made right, could be excellent adult entertainment, but without giving the viewers what they really want to see, they are nothing but a tease.  Don't waste your money if you want real adult entertainment.",1214352000,,811,4.558620689655172
