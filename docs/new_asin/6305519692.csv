7890727,5,6305519692,"This is a great live performance by America, one of the most successful groups of the early seventies. This concert was recorded before a small audience in Germany as part of the Musikladen Concert series on television for that country. It is the equivalent of what Soundstage was in the 1970's in the U.S. Here the trio performs their most critically acclaimed music up to that point. It includes all the hits except for ""Sister Golden Hair"" which is one of my favorites. I'm not sure why  they did not play that one, maybe it wasn't released yet or they simply chose not to play it. Shortly after this great concert America disappeared for the remainder of the seventies and most if not all of the eighties. They returned with a new album in the mid 90's and although the album itself is pretty good it doesn't hold up to their great albums of the 70's. If you would like to see America (the band that is) at their very best on stage than you cannot afford to miss this incredible live performance from Germany recorded in 1975 at the height of their popularity.",1066953600,,1064,4.484536082474227
7890728,5,6305519692,"If you're an Ike and Tina (or just a Tina) fan, this is well worth the price. There's lots of stuff that most people would probably think looks ""dated"" from the late 60's/early 70's, like trippy-looking  backgrounds and backscreen effects, but it looks great if you are a fan of  that look-really fun to watch. The highlights are probably ""Acid  Queen"" (with Tina wearing a dazzling, eye-popping outfit that proves  she has the best body in rock and roll, if not the entire world), ""Get  Back"", ""Proud Mary"" and a really great version of  ""Honky Tonk Woman"". As always, Tina really cuts loose on stage  with a result that makes your jaw drop, but the Ikettes are also espcially  impressive, especially during the latter number. Ike Turner claims he  designed the whole 'look' of the Ikettes including their micro-mini  costumes (if you're wondering how they could dance in them, the ultra-short  dresses had little hotpants built in...though I notice all the band members  standing behind them all have permanent huge smiles on their faces) and all  their dance moves (though they had to have serious talent to pull it off,  plus looks that could stop traffic), and if so he deserves credit for it-to  watch them dance, perfectly choreographed, with their hair flying  everywhere on the beat and moves that would throw even the most healthy  people's backs out in about 2 seconds-they are truly a force of nature. You  have to see it to believe it! I can't recommend the video enough if you're  a fan-and if you aren't, buy it and see what all the fuss is about.",960508800,,1562,4.718518518518518
