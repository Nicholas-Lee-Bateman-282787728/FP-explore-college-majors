1197775,5,B000009O1J,"this is legend. i grew up watching this. this guy is one of the greatest martial arts actor ever. his movies are always great. if you are looking for a great Kung Fu movie this is it. the original Bruce lee was great, no disrespect to the original Bruce lee, but this guy his known to be the best, some even say that he his better than the original Bruce lee. he his more entertaining than the original Bruce lee. plus his Kung Fu scenes are great. there is a lot of times he gets mad and goes into slow motion and he does Power Pits. this makes the movie even kooler.",1279670400,2,568,4.080357142857143
1197776,5,B000009O1J,"When I wrote my master's thesis on Bruce Lee's films, I did a special chapter on Bruce Lee exploitation films. Bruce Le (One E short of a full Bruce Lee!) stars in this one. The production values are awful, the villains are cliched and overdone, but GOD..what an entertaining piece of exploitation! If there was any criticism of the real Bruce Lee it was that he just didn't have enough fight scenes in his film. I know that may sound stupid, after all he choreographed masterpieces of cinema, but in the exploitation films, such as this one, the fighting is all there is since no one can act! So, if you can get over the fact that once again, you've been fooled into thinking the real Master stars in this film, sit back and enjoy.",1231459200,,732,4.42962962962963
1197777,2,B000009O1J,"There are probably hundreds of these Bruceploitation flicks out there, and I have no idea why I keep giving these horrible flicks chances.  Honestly they lack story and if they have a story all they do is ad the same plot about Bruce's controversial death. At least this one avoided that. But don't get your hopes up this movie is not that great. first of every single detail of Bruce Lee is here; from the white morning suit that he wore in Chinese Connection (fists of fury) to the yellow track suit he wore in Game of Death(Bruce last unfinished movie)

The movie doesn't really have a plot, well it does but it really isn't important. it seems that there are these Japanese trained fighters who have invaded into china and are looking for the secret plans from the Chinese, the plot is as simple as that but once again trust me it's not that important. the main character played by Bruce Le  looks a lot like him, anyway he is being attacked randomly and constantly by fighters who just simply...well... just want to fight. Really the movie is just random fight scenes over and over again, even though they are descent they are long and before you know it you're goanna start asking yourself where the story is. The story does come along but it takes so longgggggggggg that all it's heard is probably 2 or 3 sentences. another scene that could have been shorter was a fight in a tower (similar to the original game of death) the fight felt so long that i had to fast forward because it was becoming boring especially a fight scene involving Le and a another fighter who uses snakes to beat his opponents. the flick is worth to watch when you feel like watching cheesiness but if you feel like watching real kung fu skip it this is not for you.

As for the picture quality I recommend for you not to buy the one listed here, due to the fact that it's released through PASSION PRODUCTIONS and all the movies released by them have horrible quality and usually they come in a heavily truncated full screen, like the other reviewer below me said these DVD's are usually found in a Dollar Store. So if I where you i would by the Ultimate Dragon Collection that brings this film along with 10 other Bruceploitaion Classics. Don't expect any masterpieces

MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5",1201392000,,2282,4.489156626506024
1197778,1,B000009O1J,"This movie is, to put it mildly, an abomination on Bruce Lee's name. Released seven years after his death, the new footage is shoddily edited with some scenes of Lee to try and make a sequel to one of Lee's most famous films. There is practically nothing to recommend GAME OF DEATH 2. One of the earlier reviews says that Lee imposter Bruce Le (star of MY NAME CALLED BRUCE, a very obscure chop socky flick) stars instead. Simply, this movie is garbage, shame on Raymond Chow for producing this. When will people realise there was only one Bruce Lee, and the Bruce Le's, Li's, Lai's should be ashamed as well. My advice is don't watch this, check out GAME OF DEATH 1 or ENTER THE DRAGON again and see THE REAL MAN in action!!",1040774400,,725,4.377777777777778
1197779,5,B000009O1J,"I can't lie about this scene...Bruce Le was imitating Bruce Lee's every move... Especially on the ring against Bolo, when he stood on his palms reminds us about when Bruce Lee was chocked by Kareem Abdul Jabar... His diminstration at the begining of the movie..puts him a head of his time with Dragon Lee...To be perfect in using Bruce Lee's philosaphy of Jeet Kune Do...

1197781,5,B000009O1J,"Enter the Game of Death was originally released as  Game of Death 2, though both titles try to emphasize the fact that they feature the great Bruce Lee.  In reality, Bruce Lee appears only briefly, playing the part of  older brother Bobby Lo,to the true star of the film playing his younger,  wilder, brother Billy.  Bobby is investigating the death of his master  Chin-Ku when he is killed at the funeral, and as expected in a kung-fu  movie, someone has to avenge his death.  Undisciplined Billy Lo arrives on  the scene at his brother's funeral, in which they use the actual footage of  Bruce Lee's funeral. He reads an inspirational letter from his brother,and  reads his brothers book on kung-fu, which of course is the real book that  Bruce Lee wrote on his martial art style of Jeet Kune Do. From there,Billy  learns discipline, deals with the temptation of a prostitute sent to  assissinate him, fights a lion, discovers a secret temple built upside down  into the earth,and discovers what really happened to both his brother and  master Chin-Ku.  He exacts his revenge in a lengthy final fight scene, and  everything wraps up nicely.  The film has a more involved plot than most  martial arts movies,which gives it a leg up on the competition, and builds  on that with both variety and quality of fighting sequences.  Opening with  a beautiful swordsmanship form, it flows swiftly from action packed  scene,to action packed scene.  Bruce Lee has his only real fight early on  in the film, taking on Tae-kwon-do master in a poorly lit greenhouse.  It  is one of the fastest and most exciting bits in the film, and it is  unfortunate only in that it is all Bruce Lee does himself. The actor  playing his brother, unbelievably, is nearly as good as Bruce himself.  An  incredibly tough act to follow, he performs spectacularly in a fight  against a one handed servant, a bearded white man that drinks deer blood, a  multitude of nondescript guards,and a beautiful sequence with a monk armed  with a staff.  It is the final fight that shows just how good a fighter  this guy is, taking on Chin-Ku and his deadly sword in a lengthy battle  that is mind-boggling in it's artistry.  A film lost in the shuffle of the  main Bruce Lee films, this film is vastly superior to any of them, save for  Enter the Dragon.",956620800,8,2314,4.670822942643391

The grand finale fight is worth it alone, theres some great b grade fu action fun to be had here, so long as you like those types of flix you'll like this.  But seriously STAY AWAY FROM KUNG FU THEATER DVD!  The quality is awful in it, the dvd released by vengeance video is a nice widescreen presentation with nice image quality.  Unfortunately its only a pal DVD and bit expensive, I was able to luckily get it through other means, but still pissed I bought that kung fu theater disc, what a wate of money",1517270400,,598,4.36036036036036

7905591,3,B000009O1J,Bruce Le does a good impression of Bruce Lee in this martial arts film that is five minutes of dialogue and eighty minutes of kung-fu action.  Always fun to see Bolo Yueng as the bad guy's main henchman too.,1504483200,,207,4.3076923076923075
