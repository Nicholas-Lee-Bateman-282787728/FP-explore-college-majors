1402601,4,B000057X1R,"This movie is the perfect movie to help a person realize what he or she has in there life. This movie has you continually asking yourself ""What if"". Tea Leoni plays a great, believable role and Nicolas Cage just adds his oscar winning performance in to make this movie a hit. This movie gives you reason to believe in fate.",978048000,,323,4.4
1402602,5,B000057X1R,"It's A Wonderful Life....A Christmas Carol....The Christmas Story, et al, this is now among those few all time Christmas favorites.  While not available for home viewing yet, even if you don't have a machine, you'll be able to watch this film, probably by next Christmas.
This heart warming story is topped off with a totally believeable ending, which all alone is satisfying.  But do go and see it, or buy it, because there will be days when a film like this can make all the difference.",977875200,2,488,4.662790697674419
1402603,3,B000057X1R,"Upon seeing trailers for ""The Family Man"", I immediatley expected a wanna be ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  I also noticed Nicolas Cage was in the film which also lowered my expectations.  Well, I saw the film and didn't get the, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" wanna-be that I expected!  The story works well and pieces together nicely.  But, the characters in this film are not strong enough.  I found myself having to really imagine what kind of person Jack (the character played by Nicolas Cage) actually was.  In conclusion, is ""The Family Man"" a good holiday film?  Yes.  Is it a Christmas classic as stated in the trailer?  No.",977616000,2,621,4.675925925925926
1402604,3,B000057X1R,"Not a very original film, but still an enjoyable one. It's a very lightly preachy film telling us that ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, and that is so true. A very light hearted film for the hoidays is what this is. A nice cameo by Don Cheadle really makes this film worth while. So, I give Family Man 3 and 1/2 for having its heart in the right place, and great performances by Tea Leoni and the always wonderful Nic Cage. So go out and enjoy, even if it can be predictable at times...",976924800,4,475,4.0638297872340425
1402605,4,B000057X1R,"Nicholas Cage is a wall street tycoon that has everything but a real life. As Christmas approaches Cage is busy landing a mega merger deal when an ""angel of fate"" transports him into what his life could have been like if he would have stayed with his former fiance (Tea Leoni).  He finds himself with a wife of thirteen years and two very cute kids.  The problem is that he has all the memories of his wall stree existence and no idea how he got where he is.  The result is a feel good comedy that makes you wonder ""what if"".
The plot line is not all that original. It is basically the same film as ""Mr. Destiny"" except with the reverse circumstances. Also, unlike Jim Belushi, Nicholas Cage CAN act. Cage pulls off this comedy better than most of his previous performances. Tea Leoni is charming and funny in her own right. They mix well on screen and the child actors add that OH SO CUTE factor that seems to be a must have in movies lately.
Overall the movie flows good and holds interest throughout.  It plays on human emotion to the point that the viewer really seems to care about the development of the characters and wants to know what happens. The ending is hopeful without being the typical over the top sap. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it.",976492800,14,1264,4.388888888888889
1402606,4,B000057X1R,"In case you are wondering how I'm able to write a review already, my local theatre had a sneak preview. Anyway, Nicholas plays a successful business man and play boy in his best performance that I've seen. Then an angel disguised as a gangster puts him in a family life that would have been his if he had married his old girlfriend.  The Family Man is a pretty funny and touching movie but the humor stops in the middle. However, there are some great performances from Tea Leoni and Nicholas Cage. Go see this movie but leave your smaller kids (under 12) at home and see it yourself first! There is brief nudity and some suggestive material.",976406400,10,641,4.478632478632479
1402607,4,B000057X1R,"13 years ago Jack Campbell almost married his college sweethart Kate Reynolds, but his internship in London changed everything, and now he's the president of a big wall street company, according to Jack he's got everything he ever wanted.  This Christmas he's been given a chance to see a glimpse of what his life is like after marrying Kate, the life of a family man.
The Family Man reminds me of Frequency, both deals with the question of ""What If?"", and both movies show what its like to have a second chance in life.  Nicholas Cage gave a convincing performance as Jack Campbell, and he demonstrated his talent in a wide range of different roles.  Tea Leoni portrays Kate Reynolds, she provided excellent on screen chemistry with Cage, and her acting here is definitely a step up from the blockbuster hit Deep Impact.  Directed by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour,) this is a great movie to watch with your family, a feel good film during this holiday season, warm-hearted and funny, many could probably identify with Jack's first attempt at fatherhood.  I highly recommend this movie!",976233600,3,1080,4.816216216216216

1402679,2,B000057X1R,"Definitely not a Christmas classic. What is the point? Nick and Tea would have better lives if they didn't focus on their careers but on family? The movie's end disproves the point. They can still get together. Also, Alan works for Jack. He spends time with his kids and makes a lot more money than a tire salesman from NJ. So, what's the point? I'd give it 3 stars if the movie's point was clear.",1513987200,,397,4.306666666666667

I absolutely adore Nick Cage in his good movies but he also has some real stinkers out there too. This is one of his best along with ""The Rock"" . I wasn't that familiar with Tea Leone before this movie but she's just so real and good in this movie and now I get to enjoy her every week in Madame Secretary. The little girl that plays their daughter is as cute as can be as well.  This is one of my favorite Christmas movies to watch with the family.",1510531200,,534,4.037735849056604

1402706,5,B000057X1R,"This type of what if story has been told many times for example ""Mr. Destiny"" . So the concept is not unique. Yet Nicolas Cage and Ta Leoni pull it off pretty well.

The basic story is a ""what if?"" a single successful man is shown what it would be like if he had married the girl he left. He wakes up in the new environment and is disoriented. One good touch that you do not see to often is that the daughter (Makenzie Vega) perceives the change and helps him cope with his new life. This is similar to ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986), where (also staring Nicolas Cage) on recognizing her dilemma they try to help her get back.

The movie is worth a second watching. First for the story and second for the details.",1502150400,,713,4.197080291970803

Ending seemed cut and pasted in from about ten attempts to get it right.  Too quick an end too....was still blowing my nose when the credits came on....and the big knot untied about the kids was a bother.  But the film had me most of the time.  Even despite the schmaltz. I only rented, because by the time I ever get to seeing this one again, it'll be streaming Netflix.

The Family Man is one I had forgotten about, though I'm not sure how that was possible.  In this time of upheaval and uncertainty, sometimes the best medicine is a feel-good movie that teaches us something important, and The Family Man fits the bill. Great holiday movie to watch with the family, and equally worthwhile when you get a little time for yourself.  We need more movies that remind us of the importance or our decisions.

Other than that, the film is spot on with the importance and riches of relationships and the sanctity of marriage.

It's not all Christmas bells, and singing. If you really think about it, the ending is quite sad in a way that I won't spoil for you here. I really appreciate that in the movie. Life is not all that it could be, but there is hope. There is a chance to change. There is a chance to take this day, and to live each day from now on as you should have been doing all along.

1403198,5,B000057X1R,"From the first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors - I have almost nearly any movie he has starred in - so when I saw this was on Amazon for such a great price, I had to get it.

I won't go too much into what the movie is about or what happens, in case you are reading this making a decision to buy or not. What if you made a decision in your life that seemed like a no-brainer, and you lived your life never wondering about what would have happened if you took the other road - that's The Family Man.

I highly suggest picking this up whether you're a fan of Nicolas Cage or just a fan of family movies with a romantic touch. I am a grown man, and this movie makes my insides feel warm and want to grab the closest living thing and snuggle them. Is this review public?",1451001600,,822,3.886904761904762
1403199,5,B000057X1R,"One of my favorite ""Christmas movies"".  I haven't seen much that Nicolas Cage has done that I don't like.  This is a terrific, wholesome story of 'what would my life be like if...'  It definitely shows what is really important in life.",1450915200,,235,4.5476190476190474
1403200,5,B000057X1R,"This is not ""hilarious"". It is nowhere near hilarious and just that description will tell you why Universal failed to make this movie into the Christmas Classic it should have been and will one day become. Even the Amazon review is a reprint of some staff hack at Universal who not only did not have any writing ability, but he also didn't watch the movie.

This is a wonderful movie centering around family and Christmas that explores a well worn theme, ""What if?"". It is the road not taken and the song not sung. However it is done with such style and grace that there is literally not a moment of the film that does not play well. From the writing to the directing and the editing the work is excellent. But the 2 people who really bring it to life are Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni.

Nicolas Cage turns in a performance that would do Jimmy Stewart proud. That would be no coincidence because I am not sure that anyone but Cage and Stewart could pull this off the way it was done. Cage makes the transition from Wall Street guru to tire store employee so seamlessly that you, the audience, are able to follow without having to 'play along"" with the idea. Once he begins his journey into his new / old life, he rings all of the right bells for every scene. His chemistry with Tea Leoni is all blue collar and he gives it the right amount of love, respect and silliness that a real true love story would have. At the end of the film, in the airport scene, he goes from his wall street to blue collar persona in a moment, that to me, ranks as one of the best acting recitations that should be ranked with some of the greats of film. Totally believable.

Tea Leoni nailed it. She somehow managed to have the acting talent of Elizabeth Taylor while exuding the persona of Elizabeth Montgomery or Meredith Baxter. That is not to say that she played those characters, but the person she created through her art had all of the charm and appeal of your superstar middle class wife; the one as one character in the movie put it that ""every guy would give his left nut to be with."" And it is not just her looks, which are formidable, that give her the appeal that she has on screen. There is an honesty and acceptance to her character that contrasts so beautifully with ""Jack"" until he sees the light. In the airport scene with Jack, as he stands talking to her, she stares at him and if eyes could get awards for acting,hers would win. There is one point where he says something that only her eyes react to and it is perfect.

The supporting players were also cast perfectly and help to give the whole film an ensemble feel. The little girl did a great job and was a wonderful way to move part of the movie along. This story is a winner.

So Universal, if any of you ever read this......Phhhhhhttttttt..... to you and your marketing department. The Producer of this film gave you a diamond and you turned it into a piece of coal. Luckily the film cannot be kept down and even has its own followers on Facebook. It is a film for the ages and I appreciate the writing, acting and production talent that it took to make this the ""classic"" that it is now, for many of us!",1450915200,,3158,4.318718381112985

Today, most movies are all about programming the viewer that everyone is a cheater, liar, thief, rapist, child molester, has bad intentions, and so on, and so on.  It's a false matrix.  But, I digress. This movie is wonderful.  It goes to show that the shallow playboy life will just leave a man lonely, empty, and with a huge void to full.  I can fully attest that this is very true.

In some ways - they claim the kids Didn't or Won't exist. They feel they left the 'ending' - open-ended. - But I disagree and say it's pretty clear.

1403408,2,B000057X1R,"I was disappointed with this film. 95% of the film takes place with Jack being shallow and not really connecting with what really matters in life. Kate doesn't seem to respond to his insane behavior (as a result of being switched from his old life into a new one he knows nothing about) realistically. If someone really did start behaving the way he did all of a sudden, the concern would warrant medical attention for amnesia and serious mental/emotional disorders. Kate and Jack's personalities just seem like they could never be a match--Kate would always be feeling lonely because Jack is always emotionally and mentally disconnected from her. Maybe it's just the way that Nicholas Cage portrays Jack, but it just seems way off. I also should have paid more attention to the movie rating before purchasing/renting. Too much sexual content that really doesn't even add to the storyline or the depth of the movie.",1422576000,,915,4.909677419354839

1403432,4,B000057X1R,"Nicholas Cage plays Jack Campbell, who once upon a time almost married Kate (Tea Leoni) but instead went off for a year's internship to London and, 13 years later, has become a business tycoon, very wealthy and not very nice.  What matters to Jack is his cut in a deal, not whether or not the businesses involved do better.  He's a master at brokering deals to buy up companies and make changes to them, win or lose for the companies involved.  He's a happy man who has it all.

  Until he meets a man with a gun (Don Cheadle) who puts him into another life, the life he would have had had he married Kate and taken that other road.  He is no longer rich nor powerful; he is definitely not happy.  And he is still not very nice -- he even sets out to cheat on Kate, until his best friend explains to him that every guy in the neighborhood would love to be married to her.

  The question is whether or not this new life will win him over.  It's certainly touch and go, but the story is interesting, even compelling, and the movie enjoys good acting, cinematography and just about everything it needs.

  It may not be the favorite movie of many -- it's not a simple, happy go lucky Christmas romance.  No, Jack Campbell is a tough nut to crack as far as being romantic -- George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life) was always a nice guy and, in most Christmas romances the two principal characters are at least reasonably nice.  Jack isn't.  But there may be hope for him.

  If you're up to the challenge that seems impossible for him to beat, this movie will be of interest.",1421193600,,1571,4.293515358361775

1403458,4,B000057X1R,"This has always been one of my favorites, and there is a depth to it that makes repeat viewings enjoyable. I think what I like the most is that Cage's mania and weirdness in his glimpse of family life is all taken in stride by those around him - they see it as a mid-life crisis. In fact, given that most of the movie takes place in the glimpse, you wonder which life is the real one. Is this a family man who dreams of being a Wall Street hot shot, or the other way around? Had they played up that ambiguity (and removed the angel character, thus allowing the glimpse to simply happen, ala Groundhog Day) this might have been a true classic. As it is, four stars and merely very enjoyable.",1420156800,,690,4.195488721804511
1403459,5,B000057X1R,"I was surprised after the first time I saw this movie at how much I enjoyed it. Appearing stale in the trailers The Family Man makes an interesting twist on ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Created far enough along in Nicolas Cage's career that his outbursts, being better timed and more congruent to the scene, make this a movie that I don't believe would have benefited from having another actor in his place. I'd easily call this a Christmas movie because it would have to be rewritten entirely to take place at any other time (Unlike most Hallmark or Lifetime movies where a tree in the corner constitutes a Christmas movie, irrespective of the plot) Full of hypocritical circumstances and glaring pretenses uncommon for a Christmas film The Family Man manages to bring itself around as a thoughtful tale about what could have been...",1420156800,4,830,4.811188811188811

1403667,5,B000057X1R,"The Family Man is one of my all time favorite movies. It's not just a fluffy comedy or a Christmas movie it's got a ton of heart and it's one that I personally hated to see end. If you loved Its a Wonderful Life you will love this one too!

Jack Campbell seems to have it all hes the president of a big corporation and has all that comes with it the money, the sports car, the women what more could anyone guy want right?

Jack doesnt think his life could have possibly ever have gotten better than it has. But this hard hearted businessman is about to have everything he knows turned on its ear when an encounter with an otherworldly spirit suddenly turns Jacks world upside down.

Jack goes to sleep one night in his penthouse apartment and wakes up to a whole new life literally! He sudden finds himself sleeping next to Kate his college girlfriend who he hasn't seen in 13 years. He has a wife, two kids, a dog, his Ferrari has been replaced with a mini van and his penthouse apartment is gone and in its place is a little house in the suburbs of New Jersey. Its far from his big city glamorous life that hes been use to. Jack is flabbergasted by it all and who should pull up driving his Ferrari but Cash the otherworldly visitor who tells Jack that he has been given a gift. He has been given a glimpse of what his life could have been like had he chosen to stay with Kate 13 years ago and not got on that plane to London to pursue that job all those years ago.  Jack is less than impressed and wants his old life back immediately! But Cash tells him that he will have to stay in this life until he learns whatever it is that he is suppose to learn from this glimpse at what might have been.

Jack doesnt know the first thing about being a family man and at first he is completely miserable and wants nothing to do with this alternate life. He is use to being the powerful president of a major corporation not a salesman at Eds Tirestore! He's use to getting what he wants when he wants it and being able to buy pretty much anything he wants, not having to watch every penny and worry about the mortgage and the bills. But little by little the simple pleasures of a life with a beautiful wife who loves him and two kids begins to melt the heart of ice of this grumpy businessman, and show Jack that maybe he didn't know what he needed and really wanted before.

Can this simple life be what true riches really are? Can Jack have everything he wants and a family too? Is the family life really for him at all? Or will the life he didn't know that he wanted until it was shown to him suddenly be taken away as quickly as it came? Which one will he choose? And for that matter which one is even real???

I LOVE this movie from start to finish. The only thing that got to me a little was some of the language sprinkled throughout the film. I thought it could have done with a lot less of it at times. But it has a great cast that does a spectacular job in every way. And it's a story that will touch even the hardest of hearts! Its one that Frank Capra would have loved to have directed I think were he still around. Its a true feel good comedy that will have you laughing, crying and leave you smiling at the end. It's one you will find yourself watching over and over again through the years. A definite keeper!",1408147200,,3315,4.146189735614308

Enjoyed it completely.",1404172800,,254,4.5
1403677,4,B000057X1R,I really enjoy movies that make me think and this one does just that.  An interesting concept to consider the choices we make and the roads we've taken in our lives.  Also makes one realize it's never too late to take a different route!  Tia Leone does a great job too!,1403827200,,269,4.235294117647059
1403678,5,B000057X1R,"Definitely recommend this one. Kind of reminds you what's really important... ""Even if you win the rat race, you're still a rat""",1403827200,,128,4.863636363636363
1403679,3,B000057X1R,"Really?  I'm supposed to believe that Nicolas Cage settled down, married, and had a couple of kids, one of whom is obsessed with aliens?  Well, this film sort of gave us that.  Cage plays Jack Campbell, a wealthy Wall Street executive who is picked out by an angel, played by Don Cheadle and named Cash.  The angel sends Jack to an alternate reality where he married his sweetheart from long ago, played by Ta Leoni, had two kids, and works as a tire salesman.  Cash tells Jack that there's a lesson to be learned in all this, but that lesson is specifically tailored for Jack and unknown to Cash.  Okay, so I didn't like this film very much and I attribute that largely to who the lead was.  I like Nicolas Cage.  I've enjoyed his movies over the years...for the most part.  Here, he just seemed out of place, and I don't mean just in the alternate reality.  When he was describing the experience at the end of the film, it sounded more like he was trying to recall all the scenes that had already been filled.  I think Nicolas Cage was simply wrong for the role.  He's made much better movies than this (i.e. the National Treasure series.)  The rest of the cast was good, but without a proper leading man, there's only so much they could do.  Don Cheadle was definitely the most lively among them, but not by that much.  While the message about family and appreciation is there, it's pretty generic.  If you want to watch the film and perhaps prove me wrong altogether, go ahead.

1403685,5,B000057X1R,"This is the kind of story I want to see not just at Christmas time, but anytime throught the year when I need to be reminded in my own life of what is and is not important. Though you, my reader, probably have seen this on TV and are wondering whether or not to buy this for your own library, I say to you - do so. It is well worth it and you will not regret owning this movie.

Nicholas Cage (Jack Cambell) is a complete success story. He has everything he needs or wants, so he thinks. He meets what I will call a 'dark angel' who is about to change Jack's life forever. Jack steps up and prevents an incident that appears to be headed to having someone being injured or killed. He uses his own money to buy off the threat, though the sum would not even be pocket change for someone like Jack. Then he makes the mistake of trying to encourage the 'dark angel' to seek out help. This causes the 'dark angel' to pause and ask Jack if he has all he needs. Jack of course is certain he does. Not so to the 'dark angel' who sets him on a path he had at one time walked away from 13 years earlier.

The story gets good from here on. Jack wakes up in bed with Kate, his wife, the woman he left 13 years ago at the airport. (He kisses her goodbye as he leaves for London. They are engaged, but for a short duration, so he tells her, he wants to expand his career potential with stocks and marketing economics. She says goodbye with tears, for she understood what might happen all too well.) Now he finds he is married to her and they have 2 children. Furthermore, to make matters worse in his eyes, he is the top salesman at a tire distriubtor company. There are hilarious moments from this moment on.

He has to change Josh. Which he views as if the baby is a nuclear waste site. His daughter asks him if he is an alien and is her real father on the mother ship. He agrees with this statement, saying he is probably fine. They begin to form a bond that grows into some powerful moments from then on.

The new Jack is now a family man, with inlaws, with friends he most likely would never had made otherwise, with a situation abhorent to his whole view of life. Though it is a struggle, he grows into this new life, trying at one point to get back his ""real life"" when he meets the boss he had been working for when the switch occurred by the 'dark angel'. Kate is not happy about them moving to New York because she is happy with the home she has, the simple life she has. Nothing glamerous - she is a pro-bono lawyer, which means she makes minimal salary because she helps simple people with their simple problems.

Kate tells him that though she is unhappy with his plans to work for the New York firm, she will take the family and move for him. She tells him if that makes him happy, then she will make do because it is important to her that he finds what he needs in his professional life too. She states - ""I will do this for you, because I believe in us"".

This is the central theme of this movie. People mold their lives, even to do things they do not want to do, because they believe in and feel the need to make their spouse happy, fulfilled, complete. ""I believe in you"". It is not easy to do this, it is what often divides people, separates them forever, because they cannot, will not compromise or adapt to situations that make the other person happy. The key is both have to give in to the other, both have to step back and settle for partial desires for the good of the other person, or it just does not work well, never does.

Jack has adapted to his new life very well. To the point he becomes a father, a true father. Then he meets the 'dark angel' once again. He understands what this means and this tears him apart inside. He tells the 'dark angel' is it not fair to go back and forth like this, into one life, out the other. The angel reminds him it is a ""glimpse"" that he gave him, nothing more.

When he goes home to say goodbye to his children it is one of the saddist moments of any movie I have ever seen and tears always fall quietly at this point. He goes into their bedrooms and touches them, kisses them goodbye. I cannot watch this without feeling the intense sorrow he must feel, for I am a father too. It is a heart rendering scene. He then says goodbye to Kate, asking her not to forget him. He asks her to say this twice. She does though she does not understand why. I know why. He wants to plant the idea in her mind of them getting back together, if there is a chance of this occurring.

He returns to his time line. He is not the same Jack Cambell, the person who has it all. He is someone else now. He contacts Kate, who is a successful lawyer in her own right. She is in the process of moving to Paris, France. He goes to the airport and he tries to convince her to just sit with him and have a cup of coffee. She does not want this now. He then tells her of the possible life they had/could have. He tells her of their two children, of the simpler, happier lives they live/lived. He says to her: ""I have seen us together and I believe in us, Kate"". Then she finally agrees to have that cup of coffee. It is a touching scene once again. They sit and talk and it starts to snow, just as it did when Jack was saying goodbye to his family, just as it did when this new life of his began - the glimpse given to him by the 'dark angel'.

One gets the feeling it is a matter of time now and the ""father"" and ""mother"" begin a new, happier, fulfilled life for them both.",1400457600,,5496,4.080555555555556

The scene in the nursery where 'Jack' is learning to diaper a baby and is confronted by his daughter 'Annie' is worth the price of the movie.  Where do they find these brilliant child actors?  And Tea Leoni is absolutely wonderful in this film.  She never drops a stitch.  Why don't we see her more often in movies?  I'd sure like to.  Nicholas Cage isn't my favorite actor but I couldn't think of anyone who would be better for this part.  My rating is really four and a half stars, the half star for some of the soundtrack.  I wish they would have included Talking Heads in the movie proper as well as in the Trailer. Just a little irony for us adults. Dante Spinotti is my favorite cinematographer.  He makes movies beautiful and this one is no exception.  Such a wonderful movie about the choices we make and the chance to make things right.",1387584000,3,946,4.4678362573099415

In Family Man, Cage's character gets the chance to time-warp back to a moment in which he chose career and money-making, over his true love, and see what his life would have been like had he chosen love, and family, over career.
 At the end, he gets a second chance, to chose again.  I love the part where his daughter thinks he is a man from outer space who has replaced her true father.",1384646400,,667,4.277777777777778

This movie started out ok... with ""Jack"", the main character as a big time wall street broker...  He is sure he has everything in life, until he's sent to a different place and time where his life is very different because he's married his college girlfriend.  I thought Tea Leoni did a great job as the girlfriend/wife...but Nicholas Cage was too sappy and over the top.  There were some really sweet moments, some romantic moments.  But I never really believed that Nicholas Cage's character would prefer a life with a family...  Or that he really liked kids.  His acting was unconvincing.  Additionally, the end was too long and silly... the shot of Nicholas Cage running through the airport in slow motion?  really?  a director thought that would work here?  The end could have been so much better with any kind of twist.

We are talking a Ferrari, suits costing thousands, a Penthouse office, etc.  While walking home on Christmas Eve, he meets an unlikely man who changes his life forever and wakes up in a whole different life.  Just how important is that money, enyway???  Watch as Jack flips around like a fish out of water.

If you enjoyed Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" you will enjoy this movie.  It's a wonderful heartwarming film.

Nicolas Cage, Francis Ford Coppola's nephew, is a great actor; and I like the fact that I didn't even know he was a Coppola until years after I'd seen him for the first time in ""Raising Arizona"". I've been a Cage fan ever since. He is a typical ""white bread"" actor with fantastic skills who goes from the highest to the lowest in his roles with that kind of flexibility, and I've only seen him in a couple of roles I didn't like. Besides that, Don Cheadle and Tea Leoni were perfect assistants to his lead role and Cage carried the story well. I got it, but I cringe with the racial stereotypes in it -- from Cheadle to the night security guard who was so subservient and molly-coddling instead of getting his ""$4000 and a $400 bottle of Irish Scotch,"" or whatever. All he was doing was champing the bit to run and get a car for Cage's character, like no one bothered to give the night guy such nice Christmas presents.

Also liket that it's a departure for Nicolas Cage, and perhaps done when he was happier than at present, now that he's having to do all these crummy films to recoup what that dude stole from him, and pay his tax bills and whatnot.

In my opinion this movie doesn't work! This movie is about a rich successful CEO that tees off a demon (or something) that punishes him by switching his life to the family that he missed by becoming a rich tycoon. Jack goes to bed a happy, rich tycoon and wakes up poor and married, with a nagging wife, obnoxious kids and brain dead friends. The points just don't connect in this movie for me. I think that one has to have a very imaginative focus to enjoy this or just be too bliss to not catch these irregularities. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially kids. Watch the original ""It's a Wonderful Life"", much, much better! In my opinion, which I'm sure nobody cares, I would associate this movie with movies about witchcraft like ""Harry Potter"" (note that the story is totally different, but in the same category). Well let me get to the point, this movie supports non-traditional standards in marriage (the man assumes domestic roles and women supports monetarily). It also supports socialists' theories in the subtle suggestion that being rich and successful is evil. In addition the movie suggests that God's angels work through evil behavior. I can't say that God does not work through evil to turn an individual back to what's right but I can say that nowhere in the bible do angels commit criminal acts. I think because I disagree so strongly is why I dislike this movie.",1359763200,6,1552,4.6268115942028984

This movie explores that possibility for one man who is given the opportunity to see what would have happened if a different choice had been made.

Fashioned in a similar manner to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" Jack Campbell, played by Nicholas Cage, is forced to examine his life as it might have been if he had made a different choice at a significant turning point in his life. A supernatural character named Cash, played by Don Cheadle, takes over Jack's life and completely changes his world to what might have been and similar to ""A Christmas Carol"", it all takes place on one Christmas Eve night.

The initial shock of the change overwhelms Jack but gradually he begins to adjust to the life that might have been should he have married his college sweetheart played by Tea Lioni. The movie is a voyage of discovery for Jack who begins to discover suppressed emotions that he had hidden for many years. The movie does a great job of telling the story in a way that touches the heart of the viewer. If you liked ""It's A Wonderful Life"" you'll like this one too.

Tea Leoni, Don Cheadle and Makenzie Vega carry the movie and give the film characters that you really care about. Brett Ratner has a great eye for detail and brings a very authentic look to the film.

1403870,5,B000057X1R,"Absolutely one of Nicholas Cage's better movies (The other one is probably 'The Rock') with a rock-solid script.  Watched it several times and each time found a little nugget. Examples : The movie starts at the airport with Kate (Tea Leoni) asking Jack (Nicholas Cage) to stay and not go to England, saying ""I choose us!"". The movie ends at the airport with the roles reversed ie. Jack asking Kate not to go to Paris, saying ""I choose us!"". At the mall, Jack tells Kate that wearing the suit actually makes him a better man.  At the end of the movie, he tells Kate that it is she who makes him a better person.

Has other poignant memorable scenes which stands in my memory more than any other film - like the one at the restaurant when Jack dances with Kate on their anniversary and later responds to her question ""What are you sure about?"" with ""I'm sure that right now there's nowhere I'd rather be than here with you..."" The line sounds a bit corny but Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni makes it one of the best scenes in the movie.

Near the end of the film when jack realises that his 'glimpse' was about to end, he asks Kate, ""I need you to remember me, Kate. How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens."" She promises, twice in a very touching scene.

Of course at the ending, Jack's appeal to Kate telling about the life he experienced with her in his glimpse is probably my most favourite part of the movie. It stopped her dead in her tracks as she was about to board the plane and made her agree to have coffee.

The blu-ray is great but probably only marginally better than the DVD version which I bought many years ago. It is also not as sharp as the very latest blu-ray movies and the video and audio quality did not seem to have been fully exploited in this blu-ray upgrade.

.
In this gentle comedy, Nick Cage is a high power Wall Street exec who's on the verge of closing a multi-billion dollar deal. After defusing a potentially violent situation at a convenience store, Cage is given a ""glimpse"" of what his life could've been had he not flown off to London thirteen years earlier. The gun-toting mini-mart customer (Don Cheadle as an angel?) who was unable to cash a winning lottery ticket tells Cage that the transformation is coming, but it will only be temporary. When he awakens the next morning, Cage finds he's now married to the girl left behind all those years earlier (Tea Leoni); she's now a pro-bono attorney. In this alternate universe, he's a salesman at her father's tire and parts store.

Leoni and Cage have two adorable kids and a big fluffy dog. They pay mortgage on a snug home in a blue collar New Jersey neighborhood. Cage's new routine is well-defined for him: selling tires with the help of a bottle hidden in a desk drawer, bowling with the guys once a week, walking the dog late at night, mall-browsing on Saturdays, taking care of the kids on alternate work days, lifting a few with an admiring best friend (Jeremy Piven), making love with his wife if time or opportunity permit, etc.

At first the shock of going from single to married, from Ferrari to mini-van, from super-rich to lower middle class overwhelms him, but after a while Cage comes to love his new family and full life. That's why when Cheadle suddenly reappears to send him back to wealth, Wall Street and lonely singledom, he doesn't want to go.

A real heart-tugger, especially after Cage is returned to his first existence. It's a personal fave that's highly recommended!

With this story, there is absolutely no middle ground. By going to the extremes, the director makes this almost a castration of the powerful cut throat corporate tycoon and knocks him down a few pegs. Yes, Jack is a self serving, spiritually empty jerk that is having so much fun doing so, he forgets about what its like to have a moral center where the lure of love isn't just a pick up line to get a woman into bed. With that being said, Jack is VERY talented at pursuading people and is a born salesmen who is meant for a better life than working at the inlaws car dealership. But, his entire parallel life revolves around his wife and the kids with NOTHING in it for him, except just coexisting with his college sweetheart in the burbs. Yeah, his real life outside of the office is a bit empty, but he loves every minute of it... until he is shown a Grass is Greener/ diverging roads life where Jack actually had chosen his sweetheart over the promising career. And while living his parallel life, he has an unexpected run in with his former boss and like any man, Jack ascertains that he could possibly have the best of both worlds, family AND career, RIGHT?  WRONG! The wife basically lets him now that he needs to give up any dreams of success and just be satisfied with his current mundane existence with her & the kids.  Who cares if he hates being a tire salesman for the inlaws dealership, knowing (because he lived it) that he was meant for great things... just so long as we're TOGETHER.  That's ALL that REALLY matters.  While that may work in some rose colored, silver screened, fantasy world, it's not realistic.  Now, almost ANY normal man that has an ounce of testosterone in his body and some self respect, given a choice would choose the former high power life of money, fast cars and being with drop dead gorgeous women. And if given a choice, do we really belive that women would choose to be with Mr. Mom over Indiana Jones?  If I didn't know better, I would have sworn this movie was written by an anti capitalist man hating woman. Nope, just Brett Ratner. With every ounce of testosterone in my body, I found this movie EXCRUCIATING to watch and felt like I had just gotten a shot of estrogen after watching it and felt the desire to flush this nonsense out of my head.  While the nuclear family life is to be commended & is a VERY important foundation of our society, giving up ALL of your dreams and wasting your God given talents in order to just coexist with another person is not a way to live, much less fantasize about.",1308355200,8,2697,4.447368421052632
1403889,5,B000057X1R,"NOTE:  The following review is a revised version of my ""Love Conquers All"" review for The Family Man almost a whole decade ago.  I didn't have a proper account at the time, and I love this movie so, so much... so I just had to revise it!  Cheers, everyone.  ;)

I haven't cried so much from watching a movie than I did when I watched The Family Man. It is a truly, touching, magical film about second chances. Nicolas Cage is perfect for the part of Jack Campbell, the cocky, ambitious, and selfish wall street millionaire who believed he had it all until he is approached by an Angel on Christmas Eve who knows all too well of the truth that is deep inside of Jack.

That night before Christmas, Jack performs a very good deed on his way home as he stops inside a convenient store to purchase some eggnog.  He throws his own life on the line to save all who are stuck inside the store.  Therefore, this Angel grants Jack ""a glimpse.""  A glimpse of the beautiful life he could have led if he had only made different choices as a younger man. This movie is not only touching, it is a laugh riot! Watching Jack's reactions as he wakes up Christmas morning to a wife and two kids he never had.... I was crying and laughing at the same time.

This movie portrays a very important message. Life is about LOVE. You could be the richest man in the world, but without the warmth of love what is there to live for?  Why all this wealth and money with nobody you love to share it with? Jack realizes after ""the glimpse"" that deep down inside of himself, he is alone... truly, and utterly alone. He really would've had it all if he had just chosen LOVE.

A lot of people don't like the ending to this movie, but I believe that the producers were trying to make the audience think for themselves. Jack had to make the right decision HIMSELF, it could not be granted to him. Miracles do happen in real life, and in The Family Man, Jack experiences a miracle. He realizes that LOVE is true happiness. His life is with Kate, and he must get her back before his future closes right in front of his eyes. The ending is a very realistic ending. Jack and Kate couldn't just fall into eachother's arms and say, ""Okay! Let's begin our lives now!"" They needed to start all over again from scratch. What's meant to be will always find a way....God works his magic in mysterious ways.

Over a decade later, I still bawl my eyes out each and every time I watch this extraordinary film--which has been countless times.  Guess I'm just a dumb sap like that, lol.  This will forever remain one of my favorite ""modern-day holiday classics.""  It taught me that yes, there is definitely a little thing called ""Destiny"" ... but it is ultimately up to YOU to make those decisions that you feel are absolutely right--without a doubt in your heart that will get you to what is truly yours.  Destiny will only take you so far, because everyone has a BIG thing in their lives called ""Free Will.""  It is something that God and The Angels can NEVER take away from you.  They can only 'nudge' you in the right direction.  :)  From one of my favorite song lines, ""Life's a prison when you're in love alone... I don't wanna' be alone...""  :'(  (Sorry, MAJOR SAP MOMENT THERE :P)

Dear Lord, could we make things even more complicated in life or what, lol??  I know I'll keep asking for God's divine guidance and intervention because I want what is TRULY mine by divine right--nothing else!!  I don't want to end up like poor Jack.  :(  So... 5 stars goes out to God and My Angels, baby!!  *muah*  :D",1306454400,,3557,4.353566009104704
1403890,3,B000057X1R,"The endless barrage of `It's A Wonderful Life' copycats knows no bounds, and `The Family Man' is one of many who attempt to capitalize off of a good thing.  I have found myself smitten by a few (most surprisingly was that Zac Efron vehicle, `17 Again') and yet with every charming and refreshing take there is most certainly a slew of films that just come up short.  For me, `The Family Man' kind of gets it, and still it kind of doesn't.  Nicolas Cage does a respectable job, given his knack for stagnant emotional consistency.  I was shocked that he handled the character with balance, considering my usually disappointment with his lack of emotional development (why so serious all the time?).  The film though, cannot come into its own.  The premise is too candy coated and too predictably manipulated to really be anything more than a desperate attempt at box-office sympathies.  The cast is commendable, especially Tea Leoni (who deserves a better career), but in the end nothing can really rescue this forgettable film.  It cannot compete with the film it tries to emulate, but in the end it is serviceable entertainment that won't leave you regretful.

1403892,5,B000057X1R,"My husband and I took our then 2-year-old son to see ""The Family Man"" in the theater when it first premiered in 2000. We loved it then. We love it now. In fact, this film has been added to our collection of Christmas films that we watch every year, along with ""Love Actually,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""The Holiday,"" ""Trading Places,"" ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""The Stepmom,"" and ""Little Women."" (The list is growing).

Of course ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was a touchstone for this film. And, like its predecessor, this film is sure to grow in popularity over the years. Nearly every frame in this film is a gift. Nicholas Cage and To Leoni are at their best. The child actors are adorable. Yes, it is a feel-good movie. So what? Isn't that why we watch movies like this, especially around the holidays? Part of the joy of watching a film is the suspension of belief. The giving over of ourselves to enjoying a certain experience.

Those of us who are married and are parents can relate to many of the themes in this movie. I could be wrong, but I think a lot of the naysayers here are folks who don't have families, are not married, and regularly eschew the family lifestyle, especially if it involves the suburbs. Oddly enough, many critics of the suburbs are themselves the products of the suburbs, and seem to have knee-jerk reactions to anything that even slightly appears to show a positive side to life away from the city. They seem to be projecting a lot of their own insecurities and unhappiness onto this film. In fact, I think bashing the suburbs has become an American clich, too. It's a sign of unoriginality to dismiss the lives of millions of Americans who are raising their families in diverse places that have nothing to do with city centers. It's a clich to assume that anyone who lives in a suburb has never lived anywhere else or experienced any other culture or way of life.

If you can let go and enjoy a feel-good film without over-thinking it; if you are a big Nicholas Cage fan; if you want a good film for the holidays; and if you are intrigued by the idea of seeing an updated version of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this film is for you.",1292112000,5,2196,4.526448362720403
1403893,1,B000057X1R,"I agree with the other reviewers here that think this movie is horrible. Obviously contrived plot, ludicrous dialog, over the top direction, and just a bad movie. It's like so many other lame chick flicks that you've seen, that give chick flicks a bad reputation and ruin the box office for good chick flicks (like ""You've Got Mail"" or ""The Time Traveler's Wife"").

I probably can't add much over the wrath already poured out by the other reviewers, but I can add this odd insight. Somehow the title of this movie and the banal DVD spine (plain white with the title in blue and Cage's picture) seem to attract chicks. I have an entire book shelf of DVDs and when chicks look them over, they always pick this one out. It's so odd. I have other chick flicks on the shelf, and I have other Nicolas Cage movies, but they consistently pick this one out. I also get many chicks that pick the movie out and then tell me how much they love it (just like the many reviewers here that rate this movie highly, even rating it a 10!!!). I have watched the movie twice (first by choice, then by force), and I refuse to watch it ever again. So, I just punched up my DVD database and changed the DVD number for this one (I have all my DVDs numbered) so that the DVD will sit on the back of my bookshelf out of plain site. Hopefully that will cut down on the number of chicks that see and select this movie.

And finally, to those readers that also recognize this movie as horrible, it is utterly unbelievable that so many reviewers here rated this a 10! (5 stars in Amazon lingo). Interesting that the average rating is not nearly that high over on IMDB.",1289865600,,1638,4.3322475570032575

I first saw part of this film when I was over a friends house, then I decided to buy it for my self and I am  glad I did. It stars Nicolas Cage as a wall street hot shot who gets a chance to see what his life would have been like if he took a different road. He sees a simplier life with his old college sweet heart and the kids he never had might have been a better choice. It has a nice ending.

1403898,4,B000057X1R,"Nicolas Cage plays Jack Campbell, a successful, work-obsessed Wall Street businessman who ""has everything he needs"". However, when he intervenes in what looks like a store hold-up, the `hold-up man' (Don Cheadle playing the angel role, though it's never explicitly stated) gives him a `glimpse' into what his life would have been like if he'd married his college sweetheart Kate (Ta Leoni) thirteen years previously.

And so Jack wakes up on Christmas morning to find himself married with two children, holding down a job as a car tyre salesman, and with a station wagon in place of his beloved Ferrarri...

This being a Christmas feel-good movie, it's not hard to predict how the film is going to end, so the film has to stand or fall on how much fun you're going to have along the way. Fortunately, thanks to stand-out performances from both Cage and Leoni (previously wasted in the atrocious Deep Impact, this will hopefully lead to bigger and better things), The Family Man proves to be extremely enjoyable and even manages to avoid the pitfalls of cloying sentimentality that usually ruin films like this.

Cage is superb in the film, which is just as well, given that he's in every scene. Wisely, he has reined in his -to put it politely- slight tendency to overact, and his reactions to his sudden predicament are believable and convincing.",1270166400,,1347,4.873362445414847

1403908,4,B000057X1R,"There are two aspects in the review. One is of love and another is of analysis, i.e. heart vs head.

The gist of the movie: No matter how powerful/rich you are, it is futile if you don't have a family. That the ultimate purpose of life lies in family and procreation.

Most of the movie can be considered a dream, so the movie itself may not portray unrealistic events (without which not many movies exist) as long as one considers that Cage goes into sleep and dreams the whole ""family life"" up, wakes up and finds a purpose in life.

I can think of few movies which made me more emotional. So on that aspect this movie is wonderful. The message is that no matter how many differences people may have their instincts always point towards procreation and finding the ultimate purpose in the process, in an otherwise purposeless life.

I do not agree with the preaching of family values against ambition in this movie. However I understand(a bit) how people as masses believe and behave I can not express anything but sympathetic love towards the short stint of existence which many seem to believe to be a blessing.

Love is the drug of these times of materialism (which I don't disapprove) and the movie serves well as a potent drug. As people are running out of problems/suffering such as hunger, infant mortality, disease and war, people, both as individuals and as a part of the society will begin asking questions about the purpose of their lives and at societal scale this may lead to decay(in numbers and/or economy). So it is nice to have movies that make people feel purposeful.",1260316800,,1587,4.633451957295374

Cage awakens to find a wife and kids where he was single before. The wife turns out to be an old girlfriend; so this is the life-path where he marries her. Hard to know if it was all a dream or not. No real explaination of how he got moved into this alternate life-path nor how he eventually returned to his original path. No explaination of Cheadle's ""powers"" or role in all of this.

Nice relationship between Cage and his girlfriend/wife (Tea Leoni). Very believeable as a married couple with kids. A nicely made movie, good story, novel approach to the trading places theme. It is a fun and sweet movie worth watching.",1254614400,,894,4.552795031055901

We had certificates for Jim Carrey's ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", but we weren't in the mood for that, so we snuck into the theater that was playing this. I have no regrets as this movie made me hold my fiance a little bit tighter that night. Life is about choices, and Jack Campbell has to make that decision when his girlfriend tries to talk him out of going to Oxford University to pursue a financial scholarship, and begin life with her then and now. Kate is a beautiful girl, and Jack is caught between a rock and a hard place, and ends up leaving her at the airport, and goes onto success on Wall Street, but his life is lonely, and he has no one to love him in that special way. He's made aware of this when one night on the way home he is acosted by a gun toting criminal, and more or less Jack is made to review his life, and Jack just blows him off, and goes home to bed, and then he wakes up married to Kate, and is a father of 2. They live in a house in Jersey, and Jack works for Kate's uncle at a tire store. Jack is not sure of how to deal with this, and at first he doesn't believe this is happening, but as time goes on he begins to love Kate, and his children. However, the dream ends and Jack wakes up alone. He got a note from Kate to see him again, and now he wonders what's up. It turns out that Kate has done well for herself, and she just wants Jack to pick up his stuff before she moves to her new home.....Jack can't believe how beautiful Kate looks, and now feels like he has to make a move somehow, however, this time he makes the right decision, and stays with Kate. I am not much into romantic movies, but this is one of my 5 favorite romantic movies, and as I said I held my fiance a little bit tighter that night. This was overlooked, and should be considered a classic as Nicholas Cage and Tia Leone turned in good performances. I know that this movie also taught me that the best way to go was with dvd as when I first wanted to buy this movie, and I was going to buy it!!!!However, the VHS copy was fifty bucks, and the dvd was a lot less.

1403915,4,B000057X1R,"""The Family Man"" is, at its core, a Romantic Comedy, but it is also a fantasy in the ""how your life might have been"" genre that includes everything from ""Sliding Doors"" to ""It's A Wonderful Life.""

Nicolas Cage plays Jack Campbell, an ambitious young man who leaves fianc&eacute;e Kate Reynolds, played by Tea Leoni, in 1987 to pursue an internship in London.  Kate gives him a tearful, prescient speech at the airport about how certain she is that this means the end for them and begging him not to take the flight.

The prologue gives way to thirteen years later where Jack is now President of his own firm on Wall Street and Scrooge-ish Jack gives his employees management-speak encouragement for why they are there working late Christmas Eve - and must return to work Christmas as well.  (How many blockbuster mergers and acquisitions are accomplished on Christmas?  I'm just askin'.)

Jack is not only a slave-driver boss, he also makes only the most shallow attachments to any women in his life.

His secretary tells him that he has a message from Kate - who he hasn't heard from since you-know-when.

That night Jack interrupts a hold-up at the local convenience store, trying to cool off the stick-up man and save those threatened with a gun.  The stick-up guy is played by the always good Don Cheadle and... hey, he's not just a stick-up guy!  His exact nature is never exactly explained, but there are several obvious similarities with Clarence the Angel Third Class from ""Wonderful Life"".  For one, he gives Jack, against his wishes, a ""glimpse"" of the alternate reality life. (For another - he gives Jack a bell to summon him, reminiscent of the part of Wonderful Life where bell-ringing accompanies Angels receiving their wings.

The next morning Jack wakes up - in bed beside Kate, his wife of these many years, along with their two children in their suburban home in North Jersey, where they moved from New York, because that was no place to raise a family.

Since this is a fantasy, no one can say what is the correct way to respond to such a situation, but I'll go ahead and say I found Jimmy Stewart's interpretation better than Mr. Cage's.

Jack is not only no longer a wealthy Wall-Street Investment guy, he now works at his father's retail tire shop.  He no longer entertains a string of beautiful women in his bedroom.  Instead he bowls with his friend Arnie (a good turn by Jeremy Piven).

We know, because of the formula, that Jack is going to go through a period of disorientation, and we know that we're going to arrive at the place where Jack will regret leaving Kate back at the airport thirteen years ago.

I've said before that my least favorite romantic comedy clich&eacute;s is the scene where one character goes tearing off to the airport because they made The Big Mistake and to prevent losing The Love Of Their Life, but I'll also go ahead and say that Cage and Leoni do good work in this scene with good words and good direction.",1240185600,,2965,4.647509578544061
1403916,4,B000057X1R,"Sometimes modern filmmakers get it right.  Tucked in between a number of lackluster efforts, Nicolas Cage did this gem.  It's not as universally well-regarded as it is here, but I'm considered pretty fussy when it comes to giving good ratings, and I'm torn between a 4 or a 5. Perhaps it's got a little to do with my low expectations; I passed on it after its lukewarm reviews and watched it only because of my sister's glowing report.

Mostly, though, it's because it's an excellent, affecting film. It could have been played strictly as the contrivance it was, written by the numbers, but the writers did their job. They did what Josh Whedon and David E. Kelly do so well, which is find and mine the real human emotions that would occur in an otherwise outlandish situation. Brett Ratner, for his part, managed to elicit just the right notes out of Cage and Leoni (who's never looked more ravishing; my god), two actors who do well on their own, but their best with the right director. This is definitely Leoni's best performance, and one of Cage's. There are a few moments that don't ring quite true, but they stand out precisely for that reason: They're the exception, not the rule.

It centers around a man named Jack Cambell (played by Nicholas Cage), a man who has chosen a path of monetary success instead of marrying his college girlfriend Kate (played by Ta Leoni). After thirteen years since this decision (during which time he has become the president of a major investment firm), he unknowingly meets an angel (played by Don Cheadle). Jack is given what the angel calls a `glimpse' ----in his case, a chance to see what his life had been like if he had married Kate. During this experience, he finds out what is truly important in life. He finds what he has given up, and how empty his life truly is. And at the end, he finds that it still might not be too late to change his ways.
  As we follow Jack on his adventure, we are treated to excellent cinematography, directing, acting, and a beautiful score composed by Danny Elfman. This is an excellent film that will touch  the entire family.

1403936,3,B000057X1R,"They almost had me fooled. In the beginning, and rightfully so, I thought that it was one of those feel-good flicks, where some rich and powerful man (or a woman) realizes that money is not everything in life, and as a result ends up with new family, friends, religion, wisdom, and ... EVEN MORE MONEY! And things seemed to be going exactly that way. The protagonist lost his privileges, became a family man, a regular guy, secured personal happiness, and was getting back to the old Wall Street outfit (after talking gibberish to his former boss - a stalwart of high finance, who suddenly turned up stranded in the middle of New Jersey with a flat tire in his Rolls Royce). But when that storyline fell apart, I started to believe that was dealing with something deeper and more original than a mere slice of bourgeoisie propaganda. I must admit that remained under such impression until the very end of the film, and only when the movie ended, said to myself: ""Wait a minute! The man's still got everything he had before, plus a woman of his dream, but this time she is making much more money and will not insist on him giving up a good job. Of course, they do not have those children and lost 13 years of living together, but they are still young and with any luck will have enough resources to produce offsprings and add the lost years to the end of their lives. Possibly, they could decide to move to New Jersey and live in a regular suburban house, but what would they do with all that extra cash? So, what was the lesson? Those rich guys always win!""

This film is well made, by the people who know their trade, and can be wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who has nothing better to do than to watch it. I took away one star for the trivial and insincere morale, and another one for the ending. Why did they show our couple sitting together, drinking coffee? The woman already said ""OK"", and that should have been the end of it!

1403938,5,B000057X1R,"By now you probably now more or less what the plot of this film is.  If that plot sounds appealing, you will definitely like this film.  Well written, well directed, and very well acted, it takes a potentially schmaltzy premise and makes a very enjoyable film out of it.  Although the DVD box has the reviewer quote ""Hilarious"" on the front, for the most part this is an amusing and sentimental film, rather than a knee-slapper.  Once you accept the fantasy premise, most of the film rings true.  Sure, if the road not taken involves being married to Tea Leoni, the deck is stacked a bit.  But I really bought into the emotional truth at the core of this film.  My only quibble [SPOILER ALERT] concerns the ending.  Once Jack has come to love his suburban Jersey life and then is jerked back into his investment banker life, his actions don't really seem convincing.  After he tracks Kate down to her townhouse as she packs to leave for Paris, would he really turn away and leave without a greater effort to connect with her?  And having gone to the airport to make one last attempt to convince her to stay, would he once again nearly turn away after making only another feeble effort?  Seems inconsistent with his hard-driving nature and with the epiphany he had experienced in his Jersey life.  The brief scene that immediately precedes these scenes in which he tells his investment banker colleagues that he buys into his NYC life isn't enough to justify the feebleness of his subsequent efforts to win back Kate.  Clearly, these final scenes were meant to increase the drama of the eventual reconnection, but alone in the film they don't ring true to me.

Finally, there is a little bit of a glitch in the film.  [Continued spoiler alert]  At one point, Jack finds out that he and Kate moved from Greenwich Village to Jersey only after Kate became pregnant.  Their oldest child is at most five (more likely four), and 13 years have past between 1987, when Jack left for London, and 2000, when the movie is set. So that means they lived in Greenwich Village pursuing their Manhattan careers for at least seven years before settling in Jersey - unless, implausibly, Jack began working at Big Ed's early on and was commuting back and forth every day from Manhattan to Jersey.  A long enough time, you would think, for Jack to have made progress in the world of Manhattan finance, even without benefit of the London internship, and for Kate to have continued on her actual (non-pro bono lawyer) career path.  Presumably, the filmmakers needed a significant span of time to make Jack's rise to the top of the investment banking world plausible and to match Nicholas Cage's age (although Tea Leoni could easily have passed for being in her late 20s), and making their kids older would have made them less cute.  Unfortunately, though, the chronology doesn't quite add up. Still, a terrifically entertaining film (particularly at Christmas)!",1191628800,,2938,4.734774066797643

1403943,5,B000057X1R,"""Don't screw up the best thing in your life just because you're a little unsure about who you are.""

I don't know how many married guys can recall it, but I know the exact time I decided to finally take the plunge with my then-girlfriend (now my wife). It was about an hour after I watched Nicolas Cage's Family Man, a full-wonder story about a wealthy Wall Street guy, Jack, given a glimpse of the non-wealthy life he could have lived had he not gotten on a plane and be separated from his then-girlfriend almost 2 decades ago.

The transitional moments, from big-time dealer to small-time salesman, are hilarious. Used to waking up alone or with girls he just met, Jack wakes up with a wife and two kids and a dog jumping all over him. He rushes away to his sky-scraper to see his name - next to President - replaced by his junior. He tries to get into premium condo but the doorman doesn't recognize him and blocks his entrance. He struggles to change his baby son's, Josh, diapers. He has to ask his daugher, Annie, what the after-school S.O.Ps' are. He curses when his junior appears on TV shaking hands with a two corporate presidents whose merger his (ex-)company has arranged.

But then Jack learns - or discovers - the joy of loving and living in spite of financial want, in spite of the no-cushion savings, in spite of not having that suit which makes him ""feel like a man"" (but which requires taking out his kids' education fund). He misses his trappings of status but grows to love Kate, Annie and Josh more than anything in the world. The quote at the start, by Arnie his friend, captures Jack's seizing and holding on to a family he knows he loves without having to figure out entirely this new world he's been thrown into.

Sorrow beckons, though, when he realises he has to 'leave' this dream-like alternate reality which he started out hating but ended up cherishing. When the moment comes, it's full of dread, because he's back to his old super-wealthy but no-family life. He drives to the house belong to ""him and Kate"" but there's just a guy there who doesn't know any Kate. The real Kate is now a hot-shot lawyer, who's just packing up and about to transfer to Paris.

Final drama arrives when Jack rushes to the airport looking for Kate, and trying to stop her before she flies off. Remember we are already in the ""real world"" and Jack has stopped 'dreaming'.

He creates some commotion because Kate is already at the departure gate and about to board, and she keeps saying, ""Jack, do you need closure?"" which is probably what any woman would say if her boyfriend from 15 years ago, started pestering her about what ""could have been"". Kate then turns towards the gate and walks away. Jack is about to give up when he suddenly turns to Kate and desperately cries out to describe the alternate reality he's lived through with an alternate her:

""We have a house in Jersey. We have two kids, Annie and Josh. Annie's not much of a violin player, but she tries real hard. She's a little precocious, but that's only because she says what's on her mind. And when she smiles...

""And Josh, he has your eyes. He doesn't say much, but we know he's smart. He's always got his eyes open, he's always watching us. Sometimes you can look at him and you just know he's learning something new. It's like witnessing a miracle.

""The house is a mess but it's ours. After 122 more payments, it's going to be ours. And you, you're a non-profit lawyer. That's right, you're completely non-profit, but that doesn't seem to bother you.

""And we're in love. After 13 years of marriage we're still unbelievably in love. You won't even let me touch you until I've said it. I sing to you. Not all the time, but definitely on special occasions. We've dealt with our share of surprises and made a lot of sacrifices but we've stayed together.

""You see, you're a better person than I am. And it made me a better person to be around you. I don't know, maybe it was just all a dream. Maybe I went to bed one lonely night in December and I imagined it all. But I swear, nothing has ever felt more real.

""And if you get on that plane right now, it'll disappear forever. I know we could both go on with our lives and we'd both be fine, but I've seen what we could be like together. And I choose us.""

Little did Cage & Co. know that six years later, there would be another movie with another husband, another wife and another two kids (plus another dog which looked like the dog in Family Man). This movie is also about family and getting a glimpse into a major What-If. Whilst Cage started out in a scenario he did enjoy and ended back in the same situation he later detested, the main character of this movie starts out being ""tired with his life"", but ends back in the same situation an entirely changed man, thoroughly grateful for the life he has (as opposed to the life he thought he had lost).

I'm talking about Adam Sandler's Click. But I won't ruin two movies at one go (smile), so I'll end with the theme which unites these two masterpieces: Family is first, the job is completely secondary.

The film is a mix of other different films, most noticably A Christmas Carol, but much worse. There's basically two realities in this film, much like there was an alternate reality in Back To The Future.

She successfully walks a fine line between the comedic and serious sides of her role, making the film truly believeable.

With hints of Sliding Doors and Trading Places, Family Man is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, integrity, and inner strength.
Nicolas Cage, Tea Leoni, Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The film introduce us the story of a man that, once upon a time standing on a crossroad in his life, took the wrong path.

Cage is Jack Campbell. We meet him 13 years younger, when he's about to separate from girlfriend Kate to make an internship in London. She begs him not to go, because she's convinced his leaving will mark the end of his relationship.

13 years later, we realize Kate was right. Campbell is a business mogul, single and with a lifestyle that doesn't include a wife and kids.

But in Christmas' eve, Jack wakes up by divine intervention in a sort of parallel universe, where he's married to Kate, has 2 children and lives in a New Jersey suburb, and even is the local bowling team leader.

Desperate and mortified, Jack makes the impossible to return to his old life, while discovering the value that brings having friend, a living wife and a beautiful family.

It's in this part where Family Man gets its hook; exploiting the feelings and emotional bonds that comes with an almost perfect family. Cage gives out a respectable performance that is overshadow by Leoni's role, whose freshness and passion transcends the screen.

A very unconvincing and deficient ending becomes the handicap of this film. Is a lighthearted movie, with a positive message and good intentions, but it could be much better.",1120003200,,1476,4.719844357976654

He returns to the burbs and tries to acclimate to his new life.

""The Family Man"", directed by Brett Rattner (""Rush Hour"") is a film that I did not rush out to see. Last summer, I watched a terrific Australian film called ""Me Myself I"" starring Rachel Griffiths. It explores exactly the same territory. If I didn't know better, I would say that ""The Family Man"" is a remake, but the Australian film was not credited as a source.

""The Family Man"" is also very similar to the classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Both films explore the lives of men that are interested in change and both men get to see what their lives would be like if they were changed. There is a key difference and this difference is why ""The Family Man"" ultimately does not work. In ""It's A Wonderful Life"", James Stewart's character does not fulfill his dreams, but he actually likes his life. When things get very bad, all of the sacrifices he has made throughout his life come crashing down and make him resentful. He gets to see what his life would be like if he had never been born. In ""The Family Man"", Jack Campbell is very successful and seems to enjoy his life immensely. His old girlfriend calls, which prompts about a moment of misgiving. Then he is back to business. The glimpse of his alternate life is forced upon him. He soon comes to accept it, but he never really wanted it and it takes him a long time to realize that he was missing anything. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about a man's glimpse of a life that he doesn't really want. He is given the glimpse because he has helped a lot of people and his misgivings are misplaced. ""The Family Man"" is about a selfish man that really isn't interested in changing. His alternate life is forced upon him, beating him over the head until he accepts it. This is supposed to make us feel warm and fuzzy, but it only made me annoyed.

The best thing about ""The Family Man"" is actually the family woman. Tea' Leoni plays Kate, Jack's girlfriend/ wife. She is simply great. I believed she was married, made a few sacrifices and now really enjoys her life, with this man, with her two children. She is a wife I would like to have. Funny, sexy, loving, sarcastic, demanding. This is also the first major role for Tea'. Yes, I know she was the star of ""Deep Impact"", but she acted against a rock. In ""The Family Man', well, she acts against a rock.

No, that isn't fair. Nicholas Cage actually does a pretty good job. But to make this film successful, and the perennial Christmas classic it wants so bad to be, Jack needed to have a little more doubt. As I said, he loves his life. Why is it necessary to show him an alternate? He isn't thinking about suicide, he isn't unhappy, he isn't destitute. The journey becomes meaningless because the main character does not want the journey.

""The Family Man"" is the perfect film to catch on video or on cable because it has some pleasant moments that might make you smile. It isn't worth a bargain matinee.",1113350400,,3994,4.405149051490515
1403972,4,B000057X1R,"This movie is the other side of passion. It is the 'It's A Wonderful Life' of our age and just as touching. This movie is for all of us who have it all but have forgotten or don't know it and are wondering... what if? This is a story of what really matters: sharing life with those you love and measuring success by the quality of one's relationships.

The intelligent dialog is scripted in a dramatically direct but believable way, asking the question, ""What if...?"" Jack Campbell (Nicholas Cage), a powerful CEO, is a man who says, ""I have everything I need"" In fact he has more and is content with his life, but oblivious to what he might really own: those things which money can't buy. Inadvertantly, he crosses paths with an angel whose mission it is to test peoples character in their dealing with one another. Touched by a courageous act of Jack's, the angel decides to open Jack's eye's to the wealth he could never earn on Wall Street.

Jack Campbell is given a ""glimpse"" of what his life would have been had he married his college sweetheart and had a family. His is forced to live a middle class life. He ignorantly makes the life of his might-have-been family a bit chaotic as he pieces together the events which causes his middle class lifestyle instead of becoming a powerful CEO. He must continue to live this life until he, the man who has ""everything"" he needs, learns what it is that he is missing.

What really makes this story special is the reversed mid-life crisis roll of Jack Campbell. Since Jack has everthing he ever wanted it removes the typical mid-life crisis scenario of wanting more which in turn allows the story to more sincerely explore the depths of our human needs.

Although, Nicholas Cage's portrail of a powerful executive is slightly off, he is fabulous as the stund middle class father of a family he never had. Especially touching is the how his character learns to overcome his blinding ambition to become the ""envy"" of his peers for the sake of his personal pride. Nonetheless, this movie could not have been as enchanting without Tea Leoni's strong, intelligently and lovingly scripted role. Her character is the woman of our dreams... (And, then there's Tea herself!) If you are a man in your 30's who has never been married for fear of losing yourself and everything you own, you will be inspired to fearlessly entertain the hopes and joys that might be yours.

What might we have become if...? Unique is this movies positive outlook to this question. This story submits an alternate answer to those who pridefully insist they will be happy as soon as they accomplish 'something'. It suggests that joy is sharing with one's family life-as-it-is along with their hopes and dreams of what they are still becoming.

I left this movie asking myself, ""What have I become"", ""where am I going"" and ""what's really important?""",1112313600,4,2864,4.68389662027833
1403973,5,B000057X1R,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It is not often that you see a Hollywood movie glamorize the family over the go-go corporate world, but this one does it in grand fashion.  Nicholas Cage (not usually one of my favorites, but very good in this role) wakes up to find himself a family man - 2 kids and a mini-van.  He is very upset by this twist and tries to get back to his corporate life, but in the end he learns some valuable lessons (I don't want to give it all away!).

It is like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but in reverse - Cage gets to see life as it could have been so much better, whereas George Baily gets to see life as it would have been so much worse.  A very fine movie.

For the family viewer, there are a couple of ""sexy"" scenes that might not be for young children.  They are pretty quick, but you should be forewarned.",1110326400,4,833,4.104938271604938
1403974,5,B000057X1R,"As has already been pointed out, this movie is incredibly predictable (like many great movies are).  That is one of the wonderful things about a good story.  It doesn't have to have lots of plot twists to keep you interested.  As movie-viewers we simply agree to suspend our disbelief for a while and pretend that all of this is possible.

The parallels with ""Its a Wonderful Life""  are clear and obvious:  The man finds out how his life would be different if he had made one simple choice differently in the past (or present).  It is a fun little game to play.

But I think this movie goes beyond that.  I think it also hearkens, in an allegorical way, to a man's mid-life crisis.  Jack Campbell is as successful as he could ever dream of being.  He has money, women adore him (at least some do), he has lots of power, a great apartment, everything he could want.  But it is somehow empty.

Of course the movie takes place at Christmas (the time of year when many people's thoughts turn to family/friends) and he realizes that his life, while successful is inherently empty.  His ""boss"" (""Peter Lassiter"") is what Jack will become when he is older: ""a cold heartless man who only cares about money"" and how to get more of it.  He secretly admires an underling ""yes man"" (""Alan"") as someone who, while not as successful, does have a family for whom he cares deeply.

One night Jack experiences a ""glimpse"" (fantasy?) about what his life would be like if he had gotten married to his college sweetheart.  The new life he enters is full of surprises (for him, at least).  He is forced to live like the other half (""I'll get a funnel cake.  It will be the highlight of my week"").  Part of him yearns for his old life of excess and easy luxuries, but as the movie evolves he begins to see the advantages of his new existence in suburban New Jersey and simply takes ""vacations"" into his ""former life"" in the form of watching CNBC when his wife wants to make love and other similar situations.  By the end of the ""glimpse"" he wants nothing to do with that life of power and money.  He has found fulfillment.  His fantasies no longer interest him as much as his life with his wife and kids.  He lets go of that part of his life.  In fact, at the end he admits that ""nothing ever felt more real.""

If you can get past the cliche moments, predictable nature and stereotyped characters (his best friend is as stereotyped as they come) this is a touching movie about what happens because of one simple choice and what we really care about in life.

Just a little side note:  I thought the casing was odd.  Every time I watch this movie I think, ""Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni are trying their hardest to be Mel Gibson playing Jack Campbell and Meg Ryan playing Kate Reynolds,"" but that's just me.",1109376000,,2783,4.412573673870334

I like the way this movie flows. Everything about it makes it great. Every part ties everything together and makes it all make sense.

My favorite character is Annie. I love when she asks Jack if he is really her father, then starts helping her new ""alien"" father figure out how to be a better dad and husband. She starts giving him hints and fills him in on what he's supposed to do next. One of my favorite parts is when she explains to Jack how to get Josh (his son - in the glimpse) out of his car seat.

Josh, by the way, is the cutest thing. So is Annie. I think they were great casts.

One thing I don't like about this movie is the end. I wanted it to end in a way that showed something happening, whether it was Jack ending up being the ""family man"" or going back to being his old self, instead of just having them go have coffee together.

1403978,4,B000057X1R,"The idea of lesson of the road not taken has been done to death in Hollywood and never as well as when Frank Capra but Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey through the wringer of seeing what the world would have been like if he had never been born in ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  So when somebody like Jack Campbell (Nicholas Cage) wakes up on Christmas morning and discovers that instead of being a Wall Street playboy he wakes up in a bedroom in a New Jersey home with a wife and two kids he might think that he has descended into Hell, but of course it is no where as bad as Bedford Falls turned into Pottersville.  Still, there is something potent about the idea of intervention, divine or otherwise, that intervenes in some mystical way to make sure we are on the right path.

""The Family Man"" is totally predictable in terms of having the requisite scenes for this type of tale.  We begin with the ""wrong choice,"" which happened thirteen years earlier at the airport when Jack got on a plane to start his career on the way to being a major domo of mergers and acquisitions and left behind his college sweetheart, Kate Reynold (Ta Leoni), despite the fact that she pleads with him not to go.  Now play is playing Scrooge on Christmas Eve to clinch a big deal and two things happen to derail his plans and give him a glimpse of an alternative life.  First, he gets a message to call Kate.  Second, he acts to save his life during what appears to be a robbery.  The next thing he knows a strange man (Don Cheadle) is making the point that Jack has no one to blame for himself for what is about to happen.  The next morning Jack wakes up in bed with Kate and two kids come bursting through the door all excited about it being Christmas.  Jack proceeds to freak.

Again, we know what is going to happen.  There will be scenes where Jack has to function in his ""new"" life while everybody wonders why he is acting so strangely.  There will be the effort to get his old life back, the moment where he accepts his new reality, and the moment when it is taken away.  Despite this predictability the film is still worth seeing and an above average example of the well worn genre.  The reasons would be as follows:

First, there is Ta Leoni, who is as comfortable in her role of Kate as Kate is in her life.  There is a scene where Jack finally realizes what we have known from the start, that Kate is a beautiful woman, and she says in wonder, ""How can you...Look at me like you haven't seen me every day for the last 13 years?""  Nicholas Cage is certainly good in this film and his performance keeps this one from becoming sappy, but his best moments are playing off of Leoni.

Second, I liked the fact that Jack's daughter, young Annie (Makenzie Vega), figures out pretty quickly that the guy struggling to change baby Josh's diapers is not her father.  She has her own hypothesis as to what is going on that involves aliens and a mothership, but this allows Jack to receive some help on where to go and what to do to at least pretend that he knows what he is doing.  Besides, the relationship between Jack and Annie sets up one of the nicest moments in the film.

Third, I like the way the script by David Diamond & David Weissman proves that Jack is good at his Wall Street job (there is a nice deleted scene where he takes those skills to his new job as the best tire salesman in the Garden State).  A lot of times in movies like this we are told about a character's abilities rather than being shown.  This film took the time to show Jack's strengths.

Fourth, I like the way the movie played out the scene where Jack realizes that he is going to lose the life of being a family man that he has finally embraced.  The question at that point, when you have accepted that it is all going to slip away, is ""What do you do?""  I like the answer the script comes up with and the way Cage plays it.

Finally, I actually liked the way this one played out its end game, not in terms of the bookend effect but specifically in terms of where Jack is in the final scene.  Maybe I have seen this type of resolution before (it is hard to believe with how many of these there have been that this road has not been trod before as well), but it struck me as being different and certainly made me rethink the particular lesson on the film.  This might be one of the more pragmatic endings I have seen in this genre.

Certainly you have to be in the requisite mood to watch a film of this type, especially if you are concerned about saccharin levels in your cinematic intake.  I obviously put this one off for several years.  But the bottom line is that unless you are morally offended by the basic plot line of this 2000 film and its movie brethren, you should find it enjoyable.",1098403200,9,4752,4.267857142857143

This is a great film.  One of the many that get to the heart of what is important in life.  Like ""A Christmas carol"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"" this film is also about how one man gets a ""glimpse"" at Christmas about what his life could have been.

Jack is a very successful and very wealthy Wall-Street investment banker, who runs into a street wise person robbing a convenience store.  When Jack proclaims he ""doesn't need anything"" he wakes up the next day in New Jersey, with a wife and two kids, and a job selling tires.  Imagine his surprise when he is no longer the President of the firm, or lives in a NYC penthouse with a Ferrari.

Nicolas Cage is wonderful throughout.  His ability to realistically express confusion and a slow change of heart is amazing.  Tea Leoni plays his wife, and does so with a charm that is infectious, in easily her best role.

As ""Jack"" slowly begins to understand where his life took a turn he begins to understand that material possessions and career success is hardly what he thought it was.

It turns out that the robber is not really a robber but a type of Angel (similar to Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life) who will give Cage a glimpse of what life would be like if he hadn't stayed in London but instead came back and married Kate.
Cage goes to sleep in his luxury apartment and wakes up the next morning in a bed with an older Kate.  Cage slowly learns that he is really a married man with a family and instead of a big time corporate president, he is a tire salesman in his father-in-law's store.
There are several hilarious scenes and some very touching ones.  His ""new"" life looks like a nightmare at first turns out to be the life he will eventually prefer (Some of this is reminiscent of Goldie Hawn in Overboard).  Only until he realizes this, he will not be returned to his prior life by the Angel.
The director does a great job in giving us an ending that is different than what you seem to expect.  I won't say what but I think it was well done.
One thing that is not explored is that when Cage's glimpsed life finishes, he will lose his two children from that glimpsed life.  The director never touches on Cage's feelings about that, unlike the novel Replay where the main character is torn apart because a child he had in an alternate life no longer exists when he is in a different reality.
The movie is well cast and Don Cheadle is excellent as the ""angel.""",1088467200,20,2147,4.240196078431373

1403984,5,B000057X1R,"This was an interesting fantasy story.  Nicolas Cage plays Jack Campbell, an arbitrage specialist in New York--wealthy, powerful, dealing with billion dollar mergers.  Then he meets a black street punk, who apparently is actually an angel, and brags to him that he ""has everything he wants.""  That does it.

Campbell is transported back to a life he might have had, if only he'd married his true love instead of going to London and getting into banking; a family man who has a lovable family, sells tires retail, changes diapers, and has to count pennies.

How it turns out is for you to discover.  I'll not ruin it for you.  Tea Leoni is wonderful as his wife.  This is great entertainment if you are tired of the shoot-'em-ups and the car chases, and just want some heart-warming entertainment for a change of pace.  A great story.

I liked the way Cage personalized his role. I could really feel the realness of Tea's character. I also loved seeing Jeremy Piven in a supporting role. He could be a main character, he has the charm and wit that it takes. Remember Cupid, if you didn't see it, what a shame!!! Anyways, this movie helped me to pull out of the doldums. I wanted to stop being narcisstic and focusing on just me and share postive feelings with others. This movie did a good job at showing this. Connection with others instead of just about yourself and your needs. I could forego the everyday routine of the same thing over and over. I would want difference in my life but with the same members, some adventure. They really didn't show that happening in his alternate life as a family man. Well, the movie has a sparkle and some good acting.

That's the only way to make sense out of why there exists folks who do not absolutely love this movie.  I have a Masters in Communications - Cinema (shameless plug, sorry), and this is said only for perspective on my forthcoming comments.

You see, you don't need another review describing the storyline or the incredible performances turned in my Mr. Cage and the other perfectly cast players (Tea Leoni is stunning; Jeremy Piven is a hoot).

What is needed is a statement of why there exists in the world people who may not like this film.  And it's for the same reasons they would not like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Story"" and any other film that requires being vulnerable and honestly admit that deep down you are broken, hurting, and are truly not in control of your universe and you're (maybe) made at God about it.

The honest folks (i.e., the ""dog lovers"") simply get it.  The other ones (""non-dog lovers"") have to survive by never getting in touch with deep emotion and pain inside and will, tragically, never experience what is truly important and purposeful and genuine in life.

This is not an indictment of these folks.  Just an observation.

Artistically and technically, this is one of the most flawlessly executed films I know of.  It rates with director Martin Brest's 1988 ""Midnight Run"" in terms of obtaining the delicate balance of laughter and tears, outlandish scenario made believable, characters so lovable because of their vulnerability in admitting they are messed up and need help, etc ...  (the casting of De Niro opposite Grodin in 'Run' is a masterstroke, and, with the talented hand of director Brest, both completely understand their characters ""makeup"" and interaction).

The same can be said of Cage in 'The Family Man.'  It's difficult to think of anyone else being able to capture so peculiarly a dispositioned dude who is caught in a dichotomy of realities.  (And few others besides Cage have the sensibilities to capture the peculiar character traits needed to star next to Shirley MacLaine in 'Guarding Tess.')  Director Brett Ratner exhibits the same understanding of story and character in his handling of this delicate setup.  In fact, Ratner's complete understanding of this material is evidenced by his statement (in accompanying interview) that he would accept no one other than Cage to play this role.

He was right.

'The Family Man,' like all of the aforementioned films, is timeless, classic, masterful work because it is honest enough to deal (cushioned with humor) with the pain that is so deep within all of us, and do so with finely-honed technique.

Jack and Kate Campbell are the envy of everyone they know.  Jack has to learn to like his environment, he left this girl standing at the airport 13 years before, well, things are different when he wakes up in a house (not his penthouse) on Christmas morning.
From the children he has to their friends, Jack really has a life, less challenging in someways in much more rewarding than the multi-million dollar man that he is in NYC.
He goes from being the selfish man that he is to a renewed man who cares for others.  Apparently that is what he was all along, he just needed to see it.
Throughout the movie he continually is pulled between the life he left behind and the life that is just a glimpse.  You are wondering throughout whether he will choose this family life or choose to go back to his former self.
Cage does a wonderful job, is very believable and so is the whole cast.  He really has some great friends and is loved by everyone in his family role.  You are lead to wonder what the producer is trying to tell you.  There are lessons throughout this great film, quite a few laughs and more frustrations.

A man has a responsibility to his wife and children.  When you marry and father children, you have traded not who you are but the priorities of what you're about.  Too many people confuse the trade off with some kind of loss of identity.  Nic Cage's character did that!  He didn't think he would find satisfaction in love and service.  Ultimately, the film character makes the connection.  Love is about giving and receiving, but we are responsible for the giving of it.

Every day life in suburan America requires Campbell to change diapers, transport school age children, bowl with the company league, and work at a tire dealership.

Why?
It's a wonderful life:  Nicholas Cage plays the male romantic lead who has a life affirming moment that has him go back in time and see how life could have been different.  Well, in this story he does exist unlike George, but it was also Christmas time in this movie and it faintly reminded me of the story.
Scrooged - Like Bill Murray's character in Scrooged, Jack Campbell(Cage in Family Man) is well off and somewhat bitter toward the opposite sex.  We see in both films as the story progresses or goes back in time what made them both turn so sour.  They both change for the better and realize a few things about the way they really want their lives to be.
Mr. Destiny - In this movie, Jim Belushi, meets up with some one and gets an opportunity to see how his life could've turned out had he done something differently.  The plot of Family man is very similar.  Jack meets up with Don Cheadle(the black man who tries to rob the convenice store Jack goes into) and well, let's just say no one knows for sure who this criminal/angel type is, but he knows Jack and knows it is time to do something differently with his life.
I liked all these movies, and I now add ""The Family Man"" to the list.  It was charming, very funny, and bittersweet.  Tea Leoni plays the wife that Jack wakes up to the next morning after meeting the criminal/angel. Jack has gone back in time to live his life had he stayed with his ex, who was Leoni.
It was funny because my doctor had this song on in the background the day before I watched this on cable and she told me about the movie(I hadn't seen it yet), and it's the song that Cage sings to his wife at her birthday party. I'm not sure who sings it or the name but there is a line where he goes..""Sha la la la la la I love you.""  He actually had a decent voice and seemed so sincerely in love with her.  It is one of the more romantic scenes in the movie, which has some a few more.

Nicolas Cage plays this tremendously succesful investment banker who has everything life has to offer. Fantabulous Manhattan Penthouse, Ferrari, Babes, you name it.
Problem arises when he has the non-sense to intervene in a liquor store hold up.
He escapes with his life only to tell the would be robber that he has everything a chap could want. That said we know hes in for it. Vetreans of  The Devils Disciple  will immediately twig that Don Cheadles  Cash  character  ( gettit?), the hold up artist is the Great Lucifer in disguise and that Nic Cages  Jack Campbell  is about to have a Fall from Grace and be cast into the eternal flames for crossing him.
How bad can things get one wonders ?
The answer of course is gruesome as Lucifer exacts a revenge well out of synch with the purported slight.
This poor mans life descends into the very bowels of Hades.
The first circle of Hell is when he wakes up in a New Jersey suburb with a wife and two kids. The wife is old flame ( gettit?) Kate played by  Tea Leoni and Kate we know to be another spell cast by the Devil since we are asked to believe this woman is in her mid thirties, does voluntary work, has had two kids and looks like she could easily grace the centrefold of Playboys Hornycatholicschoolboysinengland Summer Special. I digress.
The kids of course are minions that have graced the lore of Anglo-Nordic/Celtic myth and legend through the ages. Outwardly they behave themselves but we know deep down they too are complicite in Jacks ruination.
Nic, God bless him tries to put his life back together. In much the manner of  Its a Wonderful Life  he experiences what the High Finance Corporate World is sans Jack except true to form the American Industrial Machine is moving along quite nicely oiled without him. He returns to New Jersey ( itself a prospect more daunting than a performance of RiverDance ) where he attempts with genuine New World optimism to put his life back together. There is a problem though and it was explored a few years back in Malachi Martins groundbreaking study of Demonic Possession  Hostage to the Devil .
Nics character Jack is in the process of being perfectly possessed and taking on this nether world as not just viable but a tangible reality. At this point of course, a Priest, a Minister, a Rabbi should have been called for but Director Brett Ratner twists the knife in even further as Jack reflects on his life as a stunning Manhattanite and decides, devistatingly to us the audience that it really wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. In a scene intentionally reminiscent of the Garden of Eden Kate lures him back to New Jersey and away from the Apple with the juicy succulent temptations of domestic bliss and hard graft.
The final horrifying blow comes when we glimpse what her life would have been without him. She is set to embark on a career as a corporate exec lawyer in Paris but Cages  Jack now perfectly possessed and more akin to a  Body Snatcher   places his own spell on her and lures her away from a life of glamour, luxury and access.
The final scene rolls the credits as we see both ghouls tete a tete in the airport bar no doubt hatching a fiendish plot to take over the world and populate it with New Jersey suburbanites.
Cage has never been better and Director Brett Ratner from a truly terrifying screenplay by David Diamond and David Weissman builds tension and menace with wonderfully composed understatement never stressing the obvious instead opting to let us the audience glean just enough information from each scene to forwarn us of Jacks impending doom.
Possibly the scariest movie this year.

Thirteen years ago, he had left his college girlfriend, Kate Reynolds (Ta Leoni), to study law in the UK. Despite how hard she tried to convince him to stay, he had decided to leave.  They never kept in contact after that.
Jack went to bed on Christmas eve and woke up on Christmas morning in a noisy house with a wife and two kids.  Apparently, this was the alternate life that he would lead if he had not left for studies 13 years ago and stayed to marry Kate.  He slowly discovered the importance and joy of having a family in the rest of the movie.
When Jack returned to his real life, he went to look for Kate, hoping to start afresh with her.  Kate had long gotten over Jack and was in the midst of packing up to leave for Paris to work.  Jack tried hard to get her to stay.

1404014,5,B000057X1R,"Who could imagine a movie directed by Mr. Brett Ratner (Rush Hour), among all directors in the world, can be a subtle and moving experience?  There's no stereotypical situation.  Even the stock suburban Jersey characters are handled with normalcy.  Every situation is portrayed with realism and honesty.  The story line is solely based on Mr. Cage's character's view point.  It feels real because he's not immediately embracing his family lifestyle.  Through out the better part of the movie, he wanted to go back to his high-flying life as a single Wall Street player.  The change of heart is so subtle and skillfully handled by the screenwriters that you are totally convinced by the time he realized what he missed from his 'glimpsed' life with Miss Leoni and the kids.
Miss Leoni is very believable in wardrobe and demeanor as an Ivy-league educated attorney turned into a Jersey wife.  She's not perfectly made-up, not a stick, and has a real glow and happiness as a wife and a mother (could it be the happy marriage with Mr. Duchovney and having two kids in real life?).  And the chemistry between Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni is palpable to say the least.
Watching the movie and listening to Mr. Ratner and his producer's commentary really enforced my belief in making movies with passion.  The passion expressed by Mr. Ratner and the producer was so heart-felt, it gives me hope for greater things to come from them.
To me the realness of this movie is in its ending.  Mr. Cage, after his blissful 'glimpse' of what could have been, tried to track down Miss Leoni in real life, who is a successful attorney also on a fast track, to give the love they once shared one more try (did I spoil the movie by revealing this?).  Like what the filmmakers said in the making-of documentary, Mr. Cage only asked Miss Leoni for a cup of coffee and they left the audience there imagining the possible outcomes.  They, as filmmakers, did not try to turn this story into a fairy tale.  Today's movie goers are sophisticated enough to know when a story is manipulative or not.  :)
It may be too late for Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni's characters to develop a life together like in Mr. Cage's glimpse.  But it's never too late for us viewers to take stock of our life and determine what really matters.",1018915200,3,2283,4.6277915632754345

On the eve before he stops by a common corner grocery store to pick up some eggnog. While there he prevents a shooting from happening by purchasing a forged lottery ticket from the would-be-shooter.

He awakens the following Christmas morning to find himself married to his college sweetheart, the father of two children, heavily in debt, and working as a tire salesman.

It is possible to see this film and walk away thinking that the movie places the ""successful life"" in a negative light. However, THE FAMILY MAN illustrates that there is honor in all professions. It doesn't matter if you are a Wall Street tycoon or a tire salesman; if that's what you do, that's what you do. What matters in life are the decisions we make; do we press the best out of each moment, and how we treat other people; do we respect others or are we indifferent?

1404017,2,B000057X1R,"The Family Man can best be described as a 'feel good' movie. It is designed to give an audience the warm fuzzies. I suppose there is nothing wrong with being made to feel fuzzy, but, in order to be put into such a state, a person needs to be sentimental. Since I very rarely feel sentimental, the movie did not work for me at all; however, I can see how it could work for a lot of people.
Jack [Nicholas Cage] is a hugely successful New York stock broker. His apartment is grand, his suits are quite expensive, he drives a Ferrari, and he has his pick of women. When he was in college, he was madly in love with Kate [Tea Leoni]. When the movie opens, we see the couple at an airport. Jack is flying to London to study for a year. Kate tearfully begs him to stay, fearing his leaving will end their relationship. Naturally, it does, and we next see Jack twelve years later, still single and so driven that he is working late on Christmas Eve in order to cement a giant corporate merger. That night he comes to the aid of the seemingly homeless Cash [Don Cheadle], who turns out to be some sort of spirit guide. The next morning, Jack wakes up to find he has been transported to some sort of alternate universe. Now he is, in fact, married to Kate. They live in New Jersey and have several of those adorable, almost maintenance-free kids you see only in the movies. He's not a stock broker in this life. He sells tires for his father-in-law. Kate hasn't become the high-powered attorney she intended to be, but rather one who defends the poor. Jack spends the rest of the movie frantically trying to get his old life back. Eventually, he learns that happiness requires a loving family. Apparently, it also requires one to live in New Jersey and to sell tires.
Only in Hollywood, where the people who make these movies are themselves often rich and single or divorced, could such a tale be conceived. It is aimed at ordinary people, who Hollywood assumes think ordinary is where it's at. The oddest thing about The Family Man is that Jack, other than being stuck with working on Christmas Eve, doesn't seem at all deprived. He not only thrives on his hectic life, he appears to love it. It's true that the life he discovers in that alternate universe is charming and fulfilling in an entirely different way, but we all make choices in life that prevent us from knowing what our lives might have been. Jack finds out that he's unknowingly been unhappy all these years, but only because the script says so. It's as though the people who made the movie couldn't bring themselves to scoff too much at their own lifestyles, which more closely resemble wealthy, successful Jack's.
Cage, Leoni and Cheadle get through their roles effortlessly. Each is used to acting in headier stuff, and this movie is a piece of cake for them. It's also a piece of cake for us, one which will seem much too artificially sweet to some viewers.",1016150400,5,2918,4.476547842401501

After performing a good deed, Cash (played by Don Cheadle), gives Jack a glimpse of what life could have been, had he made the choice of starting a family with his true love Kate Reynolds.

  Waking up next to Kate Reynolds and having kids scream ""Daddy, Daddy!"", Jack panicks, finding himself in the New Jersey suburbs, playing the role of a husband and father. The film takes off into numerous comedic situations, in a journey to find out who this ""family man"" really is. As time goes by, Jack (Nicolas Cage) becomes accustomed to this new life and finds himself falling in love with Kate (Tea Leoni) all over again, eventually becoming ""The Family Man"".

  The chemistry that Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni have is magical, making the film all the more believable and enjoyable. Tea Leoni is perfect as Kate Cambell and gives the most convincing and most memorable performance of her entire career. With many memorable scenes (such as the ""chocolate cake"" scene and the ""Kate's Birthday"" sequence) the film is one of the best I have ever seen. It's heart-warming, hypnotic, and (at times) comedic. And although the film comes to a somewhat bleek conclusion, it ends the film realistically, not giving us the ""Hollywood"" type ending you might expect.

But what makes ""The Family Man"" rise above? Three things: Brett Ratner's nimble direction, the performances from the principal cast, and an overwhelming sense of reality, life-switching aside. The movie always stays grounded, and presents an equal argument for the validity of Jack Campbell's choices. As a Wall Street exec, he's not a stereotypical heartless schmuck, but a guy who happens to like money, power, and luxury. Unlike other films with similar plots, Wall Street Jack cares about the world around him, as he proves when he intercedes a potential robbery. When he receives his glimpse, family life isn't better than his Wall Street life, just different. During the glimpse, Jack never forgets the fact that he shouldn't be there, and that's also a novelty in films of this sort. Family Jack fills his emotional needs with a family, but as a well-rounded character, his need for success is not completely forgotten. None of the characters in either life are one-dimensional. None of the choices in ""The Family Man"" are easy or obvious, and that's what makes it so refreshing. Even the ending is grounded in reality, because it is uncertain. Nothing is a given here, and that's why it's so damn good.",1011052800,,1340,5.067873303167421
1404024,5,B000057X1R,"Brett Ratner's comedy, The Family Man, focuses on Jack Campbell, played by Nicolas Cage.  Jack is now a wealthy Wall Street businessman who seems to have everything he ever wanted out of life.  However, we learn that thirteen years before present day, he made a huge decision that completely changed his future.  Jack was going off to London for a year, leaving behind his fiancee girlfriend.  His girlfriend, Kate (Tea Leoni) asked him to stay with her, but he left her there at the airport, and never saw or talked to her ever again.  Well, his ""Roadless Travel"" as he calls it, gets a wake-up call at a gas station when there is a hold-up having to do with a lottery ticket.  Jack makes a purposal with the man (Don Cheadle), and they agree to trade the winning ticket for two hundred dollars.  Unknowingly, the man holding up the store is an angel, and gives Jack a glimpse of what his life could've been like, had he stayed and married Kate.  The next morning, Jack wakes up with dog slobber on his face, and his wife on top of him, and his eye opening experience begins.
Yes, yes- you've all heard that this film is this generation's ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but what I like even more about this film rather than ""Life"" is its humor, the advantage this man has to this other life, and the romance formed between Cage and Leoni, rather than a horrifying alternate-reality where he learns how his life could have changed the world had he not been in existence.
This film is absolutely perfect.  It has everything I want out of this genre.  It doesn't go overboard, and it doesn't take itself way too seriously, or out of line.  It creates humor, romance, suspense, and packs wonderful performances.  It captures the momentum and power of ""Life"", and it makes this alternate life a good thing.  I loved how Cage interacted with this new world.  It was also fun to see him react to his job, his kids, his friends, and his low balanced checking account.  What also rang the bells for me was when the film decided to give Jack the chance to get the best of both worlds.  He was fit for the Wall Street job, and he could stay with his family at the same time.  Just when you think that is just perfect and what should happen, Jack and the audience still realize they aren't getting the point which I coped with as well.  Tea Leoni was magnificent!  My favorite part of the film with her and Cage together centered around the chocolate cake scene.  The shopping mall scene was fascinatingly humorous, and the way Jack turned his life around and learned how much more enjoyable his life would've been was truly a spectacle.
At one point with the filmmaking process, I learned that Nicolas Cage turned this film down two or three times, just because he thought the story was very corny.  Director, Brett Ratner kept on pursuing Cage because he felt he would be perfect for the role.  According to some of the special feature interviews on the DVD, Ratner convinced Nick to do a film that doesn't come knocking on his door too often.  Cage finally OK'd it, and signed on, hoping that this film might give him a better image, as well as his hopes for this film to be successful in itself.  It sure payed off.
This is Ratner's best film yet.  It is absolutely fun.  Every actor has an equal share and makes this movie excellent.  The plot is ingenious and smart.  The humor and romance excell beyond expectations.  Nicolas Cage almost seems better as a family man rather than a hard-core action hero.  There is absolutely nothing I would change with this film.  It is fall down stupendous.
QUOTE: ""Everything works for this film.  I absolutely loved the whole thing from beginning to end!  Tea Leoni and Nicolas Cage are the perfect duo.  Brett Ratner makes his golden film right here, a film that could never be made any better.  The humor soars, the romance shines, and the fun and dramatic aspect of the entire thing never lets go.

  The film is nothing short of astonishing. ""Family Man"" has it all, from comedy, to romance, to drama, you name it, ""Family Man"" has it. I was expecting a good performance by Nicolas Cage, and my expectations were exactly as how I had predicted it. But Tea Leoni, gives a performance of a life time! The chemistry between the two of them is VERY real, and therefore makes the film all the more realistic. There were plenty of smiles, and maybe for some, a tear jerker here and there, which plays with our emotions and gives us one of the best movies of all time.

  After recent misses, Cage makes the right decision to become the ""Family Man"". If no one knew of Tea Leoni to begin with, she will become a house hold name by the time you see her Oscar winning performance. As for the ending, it wasn't quite to my liking, but if you look at it, given the circumstances, it was a realistic ending, and not the Hollywood ending we were looking for. And Bret Ratner really pulls of a magnificent job as the director of such a serious film, rather than his previous work (Rush Hour, Money Talks).

Nicholas Cage's happily-rich character thinks he has it all, until an angel gives him a glimpse of what his life would have been like had he taken another path..and gives him a taste of everything that he's been missing out on in life..the happiness from a  not-rich loving family that is so much greater than what he got out of his big bucks before.

In addition to having all of this and being moving it is also very funny. Hopefully it will gain more appreciation (which it deserves) and one day become a classic! Kudos to everyone who worked on this wise & intelligent film! Many ages can enjoy this film..I'm 16 and love it. See it!",1007769600,,1184,4.401826484018265
1404035,5,B000057X1R,"Nicolas Cage plays the title character in FAMILY MAN, starting out in the film as the confident and financially successful bachelor, Jack Campbell.  Jack's life turns upside-down after a seemingly chance meeting with an angel who gives him a rare opportunity to catch a glimpse of ""what might have been"".  Jack finds himself transported in a flash to a parallel universe in which he married his college sweetheart and started a family in the suburbs -- and begins to wonder about the choices he has made in his life.
Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni are both great in this comedy, creating several memorable scenes together that you'll want to see again and again.  I especially loved seeing Jack Campbell watching the old family films of himself singing to his beloved wife on her birthday -- it was very sweet.  I laughed out loud through the scenes where Jack's ""new"" daughter suspects her dad isn't the same as he used to be when he tries to figure out how to change her little brother's diaper.

1404037,4,B000057X1R,"""The Family Man"" is a holiday film about a man who gets a glimpse at what his life would be like had he not taken ""the road less traveled."" While the film is nowhere near the magnificence and grandeur of such Christmas classics as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" from which it borrows certain plot elements, it retains a great deal of charm that quickly grows on you, and by the time the credits rolled, I was completely hooked.
As the film opens, Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) and his girlfriend, Kate (Tea Leoni), are embracing at the airport as he prepares to depart for London to take part in the first big business venture of his financial career. She pleads with him not to go, but he promises undying love to her and proceeds, where the film then advances thirteen years later to the present day, and we see that they have drifted apart. Jack is now a wealthy and arrogant businessman, with no visible sign of settling down anytime soon.
By not-so-sheer fate, he encounters a would-be thief in a convenience store, who transforms his life into a window of what it may have been had he not boarded the plane to London all those years ago. Jack wakes up on Christmas morning to find himself a husband and father, both of which he is unable to grasp or accept. As time goes on, he gleans what information he can about his ""life"" with Kate and their children, and the more he learns, the more he becomes attached to his would-be life.
To bill the film as a rip-off of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is unjustifiable. The movie obviously borrows the most popular element of the previous film's story, but while ""Life"" showed the future in an almost terrifying light, ""The Family Man"" chooses to cast a much more appealing ray on how things may have been. The result, I assure you, is more interesting than you may think, and while you won't be glued to your seat, you're sure to be satisfied at the very least.
To it's credit, it has a lot going for it, mainly from the stellar leads. Nicolas Cage is one of those very unique actors who segues from genre to genre without the slightest sign of complication. Just as we believe in him as an action guru, he is also a warm, sensitive character in his more emotional roles, and this one is no exception. Tea Leoni is beginning to make her mark on Hollywood, and this role provides her a chance to give it all she's got. Here, she shows great emotion and integrity, and she fits the character perfectly.
The story is also filled with elements that will appeal mostly to die-hard romantics and even some common followers of the genre. It allows Jack and Kate to build an understanding of one another, and just as he is trying to discover this life he never led, the both of them are coming to a crossroads with one another, at which point their relationship reaches its full bloom. What will happen once Jack is yanked back into a now-harsh reality is a satisfying payoff to the story, one that plays by the rules and succeeds by not being too saccharine or melodramatic.
There are some lighthearted moments of comedic jubilance at play, but ""The Family Man"" is more interesting as a holiday romance than anything else. The performances from Cage and Leoni bring home a wonderfully executed plot about second chances, one that is effective despite its slight lack of originality. The film gave me a warm feeling inside, and that alone is worth recommending it.",1003968000,,3420,4.535598705501618

Compromise.  That's what we do sometimes with our lives.  We cannot have everything we want, when we want it, where we want it.  We give some, we take some.

Let's begin shall we. The packaging is nice, just like most other DVDs, but look at the DVD. It doesn't have any inspring images or anything, just some boring text. This is one of the low points of the DVD.
The other low point is the rather boring ""game"" that has you choosing your destiny. It's decent, but there are few choices to choose from, and it is rather boring as you just want to get to the end of the thing.
However, despite these low points, the other parts of the DVD are amazing.

This one is about marriage, family, and the connections and sacrifices that make marriage, parenthood and yes, love, worthwhile.
Nicolas Cage plays a harried but driven Wall Street executive playboy who wakes one day to find himself trapped in a life he never wanted, married to the woman he abandoned years ago. It's a living nightmare at first, but the harder he tries to escape it, the more he begins to see that there are values and rewards that he somehow missed in his previous executive penthouse lifestyle. By the end of the movie, he's learned a lesson he will never forget.
An unexplainable fantasy in the tradition of ""Groundhog Day"", you soon find yourself accepting the unexplainable, even as the protagonist himself realizes there is no easy escape from his new reality, and learns to work within it's framework. After all, life throws all of us some unexpected ""curves"", and like the protagonist in this modern day Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Suburban Bowling League, we can become better people by accepting and embracing the crazy things life puts us through in the name of love.

1404057,2,B000057X1R,"Hey, I love the idea of this movie, even though it has been explored many times before. What would happen if you had changed one thing in your life?
Hollywood has long been the king of formula pictures. This is no exception. The problem is this subject has been done so much better on previous occasions.
Nicholas Cage plays a mega-rich Wall Street shark. He intervenes in a ""robbery"" and is catapulted into a different image of his life had he not decided to stay in England when he was younger. From this point on, the movie rides back and forth in a nonsensical journey that ends with a totally unbelievable climax.
Wanting to get caught up, I tried to suspend belief. However, the changes in the main character are so contrived it makes it hard to see this as a realistic story. ONe moment he's his jerk self, then a good person, then a jerk, etc., ad nauseum. Just before the end of the movie, he finally changes for real.
The dialog is horrible in spots. NO real person would ever say things in this manner. The situations are largely contrived, and the requisite Hollywood setup to make them unbelievable is, astonishingly, missing.
The ending is a heart tugger, but is absolutely unrealistic. Back in the ""real world"" he pulls off a coop that has to be seen to be believed.
Nicolas Cage is more wooden in this film than normal. Don Cheadle is absolutely wonderful, but unbelievable. And, Teo Leoni is the shining moment, but only in the ""glimpse"" (you'll understand if you see it).
One more thing. Some of the cinematographic devices in this film are absolutely annoying. When you can pick up on color being used to change emotions, it is intruding into the film.
Okay, I lied, one more: The transfer to DVD is horrbile in spots. You can watch the pixel patterns dance during some of the darker scene. Yuck!",997401600,4,1815,4.570552147239264

The man laughs in disbelief and tells Jack to remember that he brought this on himself as he walks away. The next morning, Jack wakes up in a house in New Jersey married to the girl he let get away 13 years before. He struggles with the changes and fights to get his old life as President of a huge Wallstreet firm back but no one from that life remembers him. Along the way, he learns a little something about life, love, and himself.
  My Opinion:  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Having a family myself, a lot of the points hit home. I was able to identify with Jack as he went over the sacrifices he had made for his family and the doubts and ""what if"" thoughts he had. The comparison of the two different lives that Jack could have was very interesting. I found myself being disappointed along with Jack when he found out he was a tire salesman. I wanted him to find a better job as well. I can see how people without families might have a harder time getting into this movie. It's hard to know what he is going through without feeling it yourself. That's why Jack had to actually go through it before he could figure it out for himself. We can only watch and imagine. Nicolas Cage and Ta Leoni are both excellent and give very good performances. I didn't doubt for a minute that they were married. I enjoyed the interaction between them. The daughter who knew something was wrong with her dad was a very nice touch.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1, DD5.1 Sound and picture were excellent. Tons of extras including deleted scenes, outtakes, trailer, production notes, and more. This is a very robust DVD release of a good movie.
What You Should Do:  See it. This DVD is a very good release and the movie is great, so it would also make a great purchase. This is a good movie for anyone with a family who ever gets discouraged or depressed from time to time.

1404060,4,B000057X1R,"It's a wonderful glimpse of ""It's A Wonderful Life"", except for the quick glimpse of Tea Leoni dancing in the shower (you never would have seen Donna Reed like this), and ladies, you get a couple of ""brief"" glimpses of Nicolas Cage in his underwear (Jimmy Stewart wouldn't have been caught dead in his underwear and you probably are glad of it).  Without these glimpses, I thought I was seeing a reverse glimpse of the great holiday classic.
Jack Campell (Nicolas Cage) is not the nice family man that Stewart portrayed in the black-and-white version.  He is a money-hungry, Wall Street wheeler-dealer exec by day, and at night, he enjoys a romp in the sack.  Leoni plays Jack's girlfriend whom he left at the airport thirteen years earlier.  She pleaded for him to stay and not go to London on business, because she had a bad vibe about it.  It was one last glimpse of him for thirteen years.  There is alot to be said for the number thirteen.  They say it is the year for glimpses.
Don Cheadle plays an angel I guess, but he's not a very nice one like Charley was in the original version.  He is introduced as a robber with a foul mouth, while Charley was a nice drunk, but they both have their bells.  Anyway, in the end, Charley earned his angel wings, but Don?  Was he working for wings?  Was God his employer or is he a self-employed angel in this one?  Nonetheless, the angel encounters Jack in a convenience store and gives him an unwelcome glimpse as the family man, the life he left behind.
This is an enchanting romantic glimpse of what could have been.  Which life will Jack choose as the ""most wonderful glimpse""?  I enjoyed this one.  It was entertaining, yet poignant.  Cage and Leoni are good in this one, but it's still a glimpse compared to the classic.",997056000,,1771,4.4875
1404061,5,B000057X1R,"In the tradition of the best films that Hollywood ever had to offer comes this refreshingly honest movie that isn't afraid to say that you don't have to be rich, hip and cynical to be successful and happy with your life.  ""The Family Man,"" directed by Brett Ratner, stars Nicolas Cage as Jack Campbell, a man who took the ""road less traveled,"" and turned his back on love for a career on Wall Street, and thirteen years later still doesn't realize how empty and shallow his life has become.  Then something happens; on Christmas Eve, Jack does a good turn to the right person at the right time.  His name is Cash (Don Cheadle), and he just happens to be a guy with, well, connections.  And the next thing Jack knows, he's getting a ""glimpse"" of what his life would have been had he made a different choice all those many years ago.  When he wakes up on Christmas morning, he's not in his bed in his penthouse apartment, but in a house in the suburbs, sleeping next to Kate Reynolds (Tea Leoni), the woman he once loved, but abandoned.  Wall Street is history; he's now a crackerjack tire salesman at ""Big Ed's,"" and he and Kate have two kids, Annie (Makenzie Vega) and Josh (Jake and Ryan Milkovich).
 Needless to say, Jack is confused; and the enigmatic Cash isn't about to let him in on what's going on-- that's for Jack to figure out on his own.  So Jack has no choice but to go on living his life-- even if it's not really ""his"" life.  And it becomes a journey of discovery; not only for Jack, but for the audience, as well.  And what follows may be fantasy, but it's fantasy with a message, from some filmmakers who aren't afraid to tell it like it is, and they do it well.
 What director Roth presents you with is an examination of what life is really all about, and what-- in the final analysis-- is really important.  And make no mistake, this isn't a film that aims for the head, it aims for the heart, scores a bullseye and doesn't apologize for it.  Is it pure, true, realistic, riveting drama?  Of course not, and it never pretends to be.  What it is, is a film that stays true to what it's all about and says some things that need to be said in this fast-food, cybersaturated world of the here and now.  It's a poignant, well made and well acted film that appeals to the universal sensibilities that in one way or another reside within even the most jaded, modernized and ""New Aged"" individuals.  Because it's an entreaty to the most basic of human needs and concerns.
 Cage was the perfect choice to play Jack; he's got a natural, sympathetic look that makes him easy to like, and combined with the emotional aspect he brings to the character it makes Jack someone to whom it is so easy to relate.  it's a performance that allows you to feel something; and that's really what this movie is all about, capturing that sense of humanity that is so often lacking in people's lives today.  Cage makes it work, and he makes it work beautifully, because he lets you share Jack's frustration, his loss, his fears and, most importantly, the hope and the love he ultimately realizes has been missing in his life.  It's a challenging role that Cage not only met, but surpassed with just the kind of exacting performance that was needed to put this story across.
 Tea Leoni gives an excellent performance, as well, as Kate.  It's a sensitive, sympathetic portrayal that serves the character and the story with great effectiveness.  Leoni makes something special out of a character that could've been just the ""female lead,"" with the purpose of being nothing more than the means of moving the story of Jack's self-discovery along.  Instead, she makes it her story as much as his by making Kate an endearing, truly integral part of the film, and she fairly sparkles on the screen.
 The supporting cast includes Jeremy Piven (Arnie), Saul Rubinek (Alan), Josef Sommer (Peter), Lisa Thornhill (Evelyn), Harve Presnell (Big Ed), Mary Beth Hurt (Adelle) and Francine York (Lorraine).  There's no doubt that personal experience and frame of reference is going to play a big part in the way ""The Family Man"" is received by the audience.  But Ratner, Cage, Leoni and everyone else connected with this project are to be commended for making an honest, heart-felt film with an important message about life in today's world.  It's a film that says success isn't just being the guy at the top of the heap, that it's okay to just ""be"" whomever or whatever you are, as long as it's what makes you happy and content.  It's a bold statement for a filmmaker to make today, and we can only hope that more artists will have the guts to make more movies like this in the future.",996710400,115,4659,4.5250596658711215

As expected, Nicolas is credible as the selfish, rich Jack Campbell. In fact, he's so good, his descent into middle-class squalor could have been absurd. After the long, initial shock, his Jack Campbell makes a believable transition in the opposite direction of George Bailey. Clearly, Tea and little MacKenzie understood their roles as catalysts, because they shook Nicolas in the right direction. Just as Don Cheadle is on the steps to Leading Man, Jeremy Piven is becoming the consummate character actor with versatility Jim Belushi might envy.",996710400,,702,5.221238938053097

1404064,3,B000057X1R,"The Family Man is a sappy variation on what is becoming a trite theme.  The alternate life plotline, which probably originated with Dickens A Christmas Carol and saw its film zenith with Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life has seen a lot of action lately.  Films that come to mind are Mr. Destiny, Sliding Doors, and Me, Myself, I.  The Family Man is by far the most shamelessly schmaltzy and borrows something from all its predecessors.  It brazenly ... elements from Its a Wonderful Life with a Christmas Eve opening where our despondent hero Jack (Nicolas Cage) tries to do a good turn for a scruffy stranger named Cash (Don Cheadle) who, as it turns out, has magical powers.  Next thing Jack knows he is in a new life where none of his former friends know who he is and his ex-girlfriend is his wife with two adorable kids.  The writers even have Cash give Jack a bell, reminiscent of ringing a bell so angels can get their wings in IAWL.  Then Jack metamorphoses from Mr. Potter to George Bailey right before our eyes.
I could fill the page with derivative elements, but you get the idea.  While the story is cute at times, it defies logic that any sane person would act the way some of the characters behave in the situations given.  The story obviously panders to the masses, ennobling the middle class and vilifying the ambitious and successful.  The clear message is that if you work hard and achieve success you will live an empty life and have no appreciation of the joys that come from abandoning your aspirations and cheerfully accepting lifes indignities.  Okay, thats a bit cynical, and lionizing the average Joe to sell tickets is nothing new, but this is a bit much.  And the ending borders on goofy.
Nicholas Cage is an excellent actor but he is just too deadpan in this role.  Director Brett Ratner cant seem to cajole any dynamism out of Cage except in the boardroom scene early in the film.  Tea Leoni gives a vivacious and lovable performance and single-handedly holds the film together from the fringes.  Don Cheadle once again steals the show with a dynamite rendering of Cash.
I rated this film a 6/10.  It is a feel good film that that is easy to like, but that takes shortcuts to make a buck.  It slathers on the sentiment and makes a virtue out of abandoning ones dreams.  Frank Capra it isnt.",996537600,4,2319,4.546987951807229
1404065,5,B000057X1R,"I laughed, I cried, I was profoundly moved.  I LOVED this movie.  The acting was top-notch - Cage's performance was magical; Tea was engaging, lovable, believable.  These two together were a delight to behold.  Haven't we all had moments of wondering ""what would my life look like if I had....?""  That's the premise of The Family Man.  A couple of scenes I really enjoyed for their value in illustrating the vast differences in the Self-made Man Jack vs. the Family Man Jack:  (disclosure:  I'm really NOT a fan of gratuitous nudity!!  Really!  but...)  The shower scene where Tea displayed a complete naturalness, lack of shame, comfortableness with her nakedness born of the familiarity that comes with 13 years of marriage vs. Nicolas's complete shock at seeing his former girlfriend exposed before him.  Also, Multi-millionaire Jack dancing in his decadent-view-of-New-York designer closet filled with scads of professional clothing vs. Family Jack opening his puny, cluttered closet full of flannel shirts, sloppily and hurriedly getting dressed and driving to his Big Ed's Tires blue-collar, panelled office filled with bowling trophies and kids' drawings.  So much contrast!
Anyway, I highly recommend Family Man.  Curl up on your comfy couch with a bowl of popcorn and soda (or maybe a latte and a cinnamon roll), sit back and enjoy.  This movie will give you a chance to appreciate what you have as a result of the choices you've made, or perhaps to wonder what might have been...",996451200,2,1489,5.0699588477366255

It loses its luster.
What would have really helped this movie along is a little more depth - perhaps additional character development of the little girl Annie who provides the warm humor, but too little of it - or maybe an extra 20 minutes tacked onto the end to resolve (at least partially) some of the dangling plot lines.",996192000,5,666,4.462809917355372
1404067,5,B000057X1R,"Here, we have yet another stellar performance from the very talented Nicolas Cage.  I was blown away by his acting in ""Con Air"" and ""Face Off"" (even though those were action movies, they still had their share of drama), and he doesn't fail to blow me away again here.  Nicolas Cage has got to be the most talented actor of our time, with the exception of Robin Williams (that guy's like superhuman when it comes to acting).  This is a story similar to that of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", where a man gets to see what his life would be like had he made different choices, except he's not dead, he's married to the girl he left in college, and they have children, and he became a family man, rather than a millionaire.  It's very interesting to watch him make the transition (he seems to be good at those kinds of parts), and try to deal with what's going on around him.  You really get caught up in the storyline.  The concept may seem a little cliche in this day in age, but it's a very interesting story (you can't wait to find out what's going to happen next), and there are a lot of good dramatic scenes.  I never cry at movies (I never saw what was so dramatic about ""Titanic"", I mean come on, that Leo guy can't act to save his life!), but I think I came closer to doing it here than in any movie I've ever seen (well, this and ""Forrest Gump"").  Tea Leoni is just amazing (I can't believe she's the same person who was in that awful sitcom), and Don Cheadle is really talented, too (although he was barely in the movie).  This is easily one of the best movies to come out in a long time, and maybe one of the best movies ever (my favorite is still ""Forrest Gump"", but this could become number two).  If you see one more movie in your life, make it this one.  It is really great.",996192000,2,1780,4.190615835777126
1404068,4,B000057X1R,"'The Family Man' tackles the tough question of what should be of top priority to a person's existence. The movie is done well, with solid directing, acting, and a wonderful score by Danny Elfman. It gets its message across by telling the story, *not* by being preachy, and manages to provide a convincing ""change-of-character"" for Jack Campbell (played by Nicholas Cage).
  The movie starts about ten years in the past, with Campbell saying goodbye to his girlfriend Kate (played wonderfully, and with much depth, by Tea Leoni). He is going to London to further his education/career. She does not want him to go, opting for them to simply ""be together"". He ends up going.  Flash forward to the present, where Jack Campbell is now the second-in-command of a highly successful corporation. He and Kate are long since history, and his ""companionship"" basically exists with the ""woman of the hour"", so to speak. He even insists that his employees work on Christmas Day. He is all about the dollar. Through a somewhat muddled plot development, he is taken from this life, and placed into another one - one where he has been married to Kate for ten years, and they live in a Jersey suburb with kids, and *not* a ton of money.
  I must admit to completely agreeing with the point which 'Family Man' is trying to make - that people, especially loved ones and family, are the most important things in life - not how much money you make, or what kind of car you drive, or that you live in a posh penthouse. During the months that Campbell lives this ""alternative life"", he learns to embrace it for its warmth and love, and many of the scenes between Cage and Leoni are touching and sweet. When it is time, inevitably, for the Campbell character to return to his ""normal life"", he of course doesn't want to go. I won't reveal how it ends, but I *will* say that it is one of the more skeptical points of the film.
  'The Family Man' is a very well put-together movie, and I love its underlying themes, but I can not give it five stars, due to a few plot points. The weak areas concern the scenario in which Campbell is granted his glimpse of the ""alternative life"", the method in which he attempts to get-in at the corporation while in this ""alternative life"", and the ending. The other problem is this: though the movie (and I) believe that in order to be truly happy you have to focus on family and friends, to love and to be loved, I know that there are *many* people out there who are *very* happy without a family, finding their passions filled with their work (career or otherwise). What's good for some isn't always good for others.
  So, taking everything into consideration, I can not give the film a *total* green light. But, otherwise, it is a wonderful movie, with much heart, and an earnest message.",996105600,,2800,4.561752988047809

Nicholas Cage has the courage to take on roles that don't seem suited to him and then make them work for him. This time around, he's an ambitious executive, so committed that he works straight through Christmas (and expects his employees to do the same). Then, in a sudden twist of fate, he gets a chance to see what his life would be like if he'd married his college sweetheart. I didn't expect to like this one, not particularly impressed by either the promos or word of mouth.  But I found this one suprisingly believable with plenty of action and a nice chemistry between Cage and Tea Leoni. There's plenty of humor, too and even the child actors do a great job in their roles. Cage is great as the exec who has a hard time accepting a lower class life than the one he'd had, not to mention the additional responsibilities of being a husband and father, not exactly something you can learn overnight. As time goes on and he sees all he's missed by living life in the fast lane, he undergoes a change but it isn't a quick one. It is a growing realization that evolves quite realistically, slowly, even in fits and starts.

The ending could have been a little bit more fulfilling.
With that said, the rest of the film is a sure treat for all.  The little kids in the film are so adorable, and when they're gone, you wish they were back.  It's amazing how well the little girl acted in this movie.  As far as the stars go, Nicolas Cage delivered the goods as he always does.  Tea Leoni did a surprisingly well job.  Don Cheadle stood out like he does in every film he ever stars in.  The acting is on with bascially every actor in the film.  There's no complaining about the acting in the one.

1404073,4,B000057X1R,"is the theme for a touching picture directed by Brett Ratner, who had not distinguished himself in film making before this little gem.
Nicholas Cage is all too believable as both the successful arbitrage shark and his ""what might have been"" self, an everyman sales manager in suburban New Jersey with a wife, two kids, and, as neighborhood pal Jeremy Piven puts it...""4 bedrooms & 2 1/2 baths"".
Not a comedy (although the DVD jacket lists it as ""Hilarious!""), the Family Man is a bittersweet look at how a life can take different directions, and how many of us fall into our paths, rather than make deliberate decisions.  A play on ""A Christmas Carol"", right down to the time of year, the movie pulls no punches about the day to day difficulty of raising two kids on two incomes and how the sameness of the days is not really appreciated unless you are on the outside looking in.
Cage gives a strong performance, and is likeable in either lifestyle, although his Ferrari fits him better than does his mini-van.  Tea Leoni is a revelation...she plays Kate as a practical, funny young mom and lover...in certain scenes she is radiant.  Her line...""I choose us"" resounds through the movie and  the audience is drawn to her, particularly in the morning anniversary scene, the exhausting trip to the mall, and the fight over the chocolate cake.
Don Cheadle adds to every movie he makes, whether in a dramatic (""Traffic"") role, or a comedic cameo, as he does here.  Also particularly charming is Cage's boss and the youngster who plays his daughter.
The special features are grand...commentary, particularly from Danny Elfman, outtakes and the Hi Jack Montage are all outstanding.  The camera is crisp and brilliant in New York City, and contrasts New Jersey with the tackiness of local spots such as the bowling alley and signage at Bloomies and Big Ed's.

So one morning he finds himself as a family man and.. well.. he begins to like it. Off course he is torn out of that illusion and realisez it would be great to see Kate again and live this life for real.
CAST: Nicolas Cage is perfect. He manages to carry the movie and keep the ballance between comedy and tragedy. We all know he's got the sadest eyes in Hollywood but he can also be extremely funny. Tea Leoni plays a likeable Kate Reynolds. She is the perfect wife for Nicolas Cage. There's a lot of chemistry between the two of them and you don't wanna be Jack Campbell if Katie is getting angry. Don Cheadle, who was brilliant in Traffic is reduced to a chliched African American who goves Jack the glimps of the what if world.
WRITING/DIRECTING: This could have been such a sappy romantic movie but it actualy touched me on several levels and warmed my heart. The combination of comedy (which sometimes is a bit too over the top) and Drama works pretty well and you begin to ask those famous questions to yourself. What if, what if.. Brett Rattner.. well, I couldn't believe that after two mediocre buddy movies (Rush Hour and Money talks) he'd be able to direct a serious movie. He did a great job. My favourite shot is when Cage walks his dog. Also the images have a warm feeling to them which adds to the story.
THE DVD:Making of, Deleted scenes, hillarious outtakes, director/producer/writer commentaries. All you could ask for. But what makes this DVD an absolute winner is the isolated music score with commentary by Danny Elfman, who I would hire if I would ever do a Christmas movie...

Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni were both wonderful in this movie, and I enjoyed watching it, but I was really bothered by the utter selfishness of its message.",995241600,3,873,4.331288343558282
1404087,5,B000057X1R,It is more than a family Christmas movie. The picture provokes you to think what is really important in your life. Rather it's going to be a great carrier and lots of money or maybe some old-fashioned values like to have a loving family. The movie raises challenging question in society that is dominated by money.,995241600,,314,4.625
1404088,5,B000057X1R,"In fact, the title may sound a bit boring. However, the content isn't the same thing.  It gives me a reflect on what I really need in my life.  Money? Power? or any other things.  You can see how a successful person as described in the film try another kind of experience if he has nade a totally different decision.  And, I think most of us will have the same feelings. We made a decison and we might still believe that if we had chosen something different, the outcome may be different.  Would we then feel regret . I am not sure.  But, at least , I can say that some may still notice that they have missed something important in their life, and this film is what they should watch.",993945600,,684,4.183206106870229
1404089,5,B000057X1R,"Ever since i saw this movie more than six months ago, I've been wracking my brain trying to come up with words to explain this phenominal movie to those who have yet to see it. I realize now that there are no words to even begin explaining it.
For those of you with family or dreams of a family who stick by your side no matter how many mistakes you make, this movie is for you.  If you have an open heart, this movie is for you.
One particular scene that sticks in my mind is when Jack Cambell (Nic Cage) is so stressed with his new-found family life that he tries on a $2,000 suit at the mall and wishes to purchase it.  This leads to a arguement between him and his wife.  And yet for their anniversery, she finds him an exact replica of the suit at an outlet mall and gives it to him.  Jack is touched.  The scenes like this make The Family Man the movie it is and I simply cannot wait to buy it.",993772800,9,900,3.977777777777778
1404090,4,B000057X1R,"Nick Cage was great in this film. I am a huge Cage fan and I will enjoy anything he does. This movie is very familar so it is not a totally new idea, However, it was still a lot of fun and very cute. I look forward to purchasing it as soon as it comes out. Cage could do no bad film. Once again he shows his diversity.",992563200,,318,3.6911764705882355
1404091,5,B000057X1R,"This movie was great.  I was expecting Nic Cage usual stuff, but it was a funny heartwarming tale about life.  Really made me look at myself in a mirror.  Guys I am telling you, this is not only good for girlfriends, but is funny stuff.",990230400,2,236,4.2
1404092,5,B000057X1R,"I don't know why so many reviewers were lukeworm or hostile to this film, and the film certainly didn't get the credit it deserved in the box office. Being a management consultant myself, I find the globe-trotting, jet-setting lifestyle of Cage's character highly believable. And the movie brings to fore the issue that too many overworked young professionals face today, namely the balance between career and family. Last but not least, it should be mentioned that Tea Leoni is as charming as ever in this film.",989712000,5,512,4.965116279069767
1404093,5,B000057X1R,"I saw this movie in the theatre just after Christmas and I have to say it is one of the best romantic drama/fantasy movies I've ever seen.  Nicolas Cage proves once again that his acting skills are second to none, and I don't think I've seen Tea Leoni in a better role.
Cage's character, a rich, hard-working businessman with no time for a real relationship comes across his ex-finacee's phone number after he chose to leave her in order to accept a job offer years before.
A 'guardian angel' of sorts gives him the chance to take a glimpse of how his life would be if he didn't get on that plane.  And the result is phenomenal.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever wondered, ""What if I made different choices in life.""
Why this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, but it is indeed a great film which the whole family will surely enjoy.",989452800,36,854,4.325
1404094,4,B000057X1R,"""The Family Man"" is a cheerful movie with an attractive cast, good family humor, and a positive message.  I thought ""The Family Man"" was the setting for a good holiday classic in the style of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" sure to put you in a good mood coming from the theater (or your couch).
I really liked the movie, but there were only two problems.  The first being the ending (but not bad enough to ruin your mood).  The second was the story.  As Roger Ebert pointed out, the story was almost the exact same as a movie that was released earlier that year called, ""Me, Myself, and I."" ...
However, I would still recommend the movie to friends and family, and I don't think those short-comings would ruin the movie too much.  Personally, I would want the super rich bachelor life, but that's just me.",988588800,,799,4.445205479452055
1404095,5,B000057X1R,"Briliant, just simply Briliant, preformances By Cage and Leoni.  I can't remember watching a movie that made me think questions like ""what if I had made different choses in my life, where would I be?""",985392000,,200,4.714285714285714
1404096,4,B000057X1R,"Another surprising movie that I found easier to watch than expected.  It seems every year around Christmastime a writer will borrow the same storyline for It's A Wonderful Life, and make a movie that is a horrific copy.  While borrowing the premise, the film definately breathes a life of its own.  The end result is a warm Christmas movie, more for adults than for the kids.
Nick Cage sheds the Ferraris early and is thrust into middle-class hell, surounded by a wife, kids, and a dog.  How would you feel if you models used to fawn over you and you'd put together billion-dollar business mergers, suddenly to find that your one hobby was bowling (not to knock the bowlers out there).
Tea Leoni actually proves that she can act.  This is a far cry from her short-lived TV series.  She and Cage together do make quite a pair.
My only complaint about this film is the driving force behind the theory that every person will be happier and have a more fulfilling life if they are married with a family.  What is wrong with being older, successful, and happy with still being a bachelor?  Do you have to have a band of gold (or platinum, if that's your choice!) around your finger to achieve a good night's sleep?
Oh yeah, one of the brightest spots in the film was Don Cheadle (one of my favorite actors).  He easily steals the scenes in any movie he's in and this is no exception.  His wit and performance would easily get him his wings.....
*And if you don't get my title just watch the movie*",983923200,4,1492,4.452205882352941
1404097,4,B000057X1R,"Nicolas Cage hits your movie screens again in this delightfully fun romantic comedy about a man being given a second chance at happiness.  Jack (Cage) is rich, powerful, and believes that he has everything he could ever need in life.  But Cash (Don Chealde) a wondering man lets Jack take a glimpse of what his life could have been.  I got a kick out of seeing Nicolas Cage trying to sell tires.  He reallys shows us that he is still a funny guy and can crack a few jokes instead of shooting up the place.  Brett Ratner does a job well done as well.  Take a date to see this and enjoy the fun.",979516800,,593,4.157894736842105

1404099,5,B000057X1R,"When we decided to go to the cinema (I, my mother and my sisters) I needed a movie which was enjoyable to all of us. And that's hard. Mostly we go to a romantic comedy. And alltough I didn't expect much of ""The Family Man"", it was the movie which came the closest to it.
The movie begins pretty basic like other Christmas movies, but soon, it gets very funny and heart warming.  However, after the first half, the movie gets a bit too serious than is needed. In that part I would have liked some more laughs.
Alltough not a classic, this movie is still a good movie to see with the whole family.",978134400,,595,4.173913043478261
