200832,4,1600618138,"This is a very useful DVD. Having done an art course at my local college, I knew little more, if anything, than when I started. I had so wanted to get to grips with tone. This DVD is like magic, after years of struggling, it cleared everything up in a matter of minutes. Lee is a very strict teacher, but don't be put off, she means well and is a good instructor. She gives you the opportunity to practice until you are perfect. I didn't actually follow her advice with regard to materials, but found good results using an ordinary 2B pencil and a roll of stiffish paper to achieve the same effect. Then we launch into the portrait itself. I was surprised to find that she works from a photograph, but then most home artists will find this the easiest way. Enjoy it - this DVD actually made a difference to my work and I can see a huge improvement. I preferred this to the book. This review first appeared on Karen Platt's book review website.",1296604800,15,943,4.333333333333333
200833,4,1600618138,"I purchased Lee Hammond's book ""How to Draw Lifelike Portraits from Photographs"" and learned much from the exercises but the DVD gives life and a third deminsion to the printed page.  ""Do what I do"" is a more appropriate advise than ""Do What I say.""  The book was very good; the DVD is great; I recommend to anyone who is as hard-headed as me, the DVD.

My only criticism is that it was so short.  I look forward to other DVDs Ms. Hammond will produce. I will one of the first to purchase.",1265414400,11,489,4.225806451612903

7800103,5,1600618138,"Lee Hammond has helped me improve my drawing beyond what I thought possible. I recommend her books and videos to anyone who wants to draw, even if you think you can't, because by the time you're done practicing a few times using her techniques, you will be able to draw.",1390867200,,270,4.42
7800104,5,1600618138,"I already had the book ""How to draw lifelike portraits from photographs"" and I was wondering: does this DVD add much to the book ? Yes it does!

What does this DVD offer on top of the book:
- A demonstration by the author: how does she actually draw a portrait.
- A lot of extra tips on drawing portraits.
- In what sequence do you work. Where do you start, what do you do later.
- How do you fix things if it's not right the first time (which it never is).
- How to make the portrait one whole; connect the parts of the face: eyes, nose, mouth, etc.

Lee makes one portrait, based on a frontal photo of her three year old granddaughter, demonstrating the various steps; chapters in the book. It is clear Lee has a lot of experience as an art instructor; her instructions and demonstration are excellent; very clear and she instills confidence ""I can learn/do this"".

In my view the DVD is not a replacement of the book, but an addition. I think it's best to first read the book and then watch the DVD to see how it actually works and get additional tips.
I already liked the book, and I enjoyed the DVD even more.",1329955200,4,1114,4.196261682242991

7800106,5,1600618138,"This DVD is great for anyone that wants to improve their drawing. I have the book, but seeing the artist show, how she does it is wonderful. It is fun and not boring at all, and I will certainly be looking for more of Lee Hammond dvds and workshops.",1304553600,7,249,4.1020408163265305
