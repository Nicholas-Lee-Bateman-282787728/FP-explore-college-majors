5742564,5,B00CVB6UXW,Excellent to have all episodes in one set rather than other if interested having to purchase several different sets highlighting certain aspect rather than the total series.,1387756800,7,173,5.444444444444445
5742565,5,B00CVB6UXW,"I thought I had seen every modern war documentary before I found this series, so I approached it with a somewhat skeptical attitude.  I probably wouldn't have purchased it at all except the price was exceptionally good, and I figured that if there were even a handful of decent documentaries I would get my money's worth.  Instead, I was very pleased to discover that this entire series is very well done, and contained extensive information and footage that I had not seen elsewhere.  Each episode focuses on a particular historical moment, but they do a great job of setting that moment into broader historical context, analyzing the players, and looking at the dynamics of why things went the way they did.  The quality of this series is comparable to the Nugus Martin documentaries, some of my favorites.  The series covers mainly World War II and the Cold War (with associated conflicts in the Middle East and Vietnam).  It covers the first Gulf War but not the second: this gives the documentaries on the first Gulf War a kind of eerie perspective, because they talk about the ongoing issues involved with Saddam Hussein being in power.  I think the treatment throughout is pretty even-handedthese are histories, not propaganda pieces, and there is an honest effort to represent the perspectives of both sides in most episodes.",1387411200,3,1333,4.924107142857143
5742566,5,B00CVB6UXW,"A great series for those interested in the intellectual and technological reasons for why the Allies won the war.  Fascinating.  I will watch over and over.  Also, can't go wrong with narration by Charlton Heston.  Well worth $12.99.",1386633600,10,233,5.052631578947368
5742567,5,B00CVB6UXW,"Very accurate recording of history and tells of many events that did not make it into the history books. Charlton Heston does he usual very good job of narration and for the money, this 65 Episode Series could well be priced at least 3 times the original price.

5742569,5,B00CVB6UXW,"I saw this advertised on television for a much higher price. So I bought it for some day when I had nothing else to do. I will get around to viewing it one day, and if it is really bad, I will update this review. For now I gave it five stars as the subject matter looked interesting",1382745600,,282,3.8793103448275863
5742570,5,B00CVB6UXW,"This underrated and little known series is well worth your time.  Stumbled upon this series on YouTube, well worth the very cheap price to own the 65 episode series.  Will watch many times.

Buy it now.

It presents complex, important, fascinating, and timely topics in a way that respects your intelligence. It doesn't polarize or politicize, but in leaving it up to the viewer to decide, makes its points better than if it had tried to overtly influence or mythologize or criticize. Even the episodes dealing with World War II, or earlier conflicts, explain as much as the more modern episodes about the world we live in today, the origins of its conflicts, and in some cases the intractability of some of the issues and parties involved.

The use of news and Signal Corps/military video is good. Where the episodes might repeat material from one season to the next, that's OK--it just shows how certain themes reach back in history, or across conflicts. The tone is mature and nonsentimental, and I've been able to watch it with ""liberal"" minded friends as well as ""conservative"" ones, and then have grownup discussions instead of the Stooge-slapping that discussions of warfare or the military have usually come to involve in the past 40 years. This is history as it used to be done, but no longer is: topical experts telling stories about important issues and events, across many nations, laying out the stresses, opportunities, and drawbacks, and showing how sometimes a leader, a people, or a nation are faced with choices that vary from heartbreaking to devastating.

We particularly like the ones dealing with the technical aspects of warfare, especially cryptology, espionage, and the mechanization of warfare and force. This is where a nation grounded in ""Yankee ingenuity"" and the rewarding of genius comes to the forefront.

All in all, you will come away from this series grateful to be living today in the century that, so far, has not experienced ""total war."" For me, it is like sitting with my parents and uncles/aunts, and hearing them talk about their experience of WWII, both at home and overseas. They were calm, practical people with hopes of peace and freedom...who nevertheless answered the call to play their roles in conflict, despite misgivings and with full knowledge that their leaders were NOT perfect, and indeed that no adult decision ever was.  They were not hugely schooled/educated people, but they were very learned in the world, they read a lot, and they knew a lot about the world around them.

And, finally, listening to Charlton Heston's voice is like having your temples massaged with warm cream cheese. His delivery is so calm, his diction and reading style so literate and intelligent, it's the honey on this many layered baklava of world history.",1379289600,89,2790,4.969957081545064
5742571,5,B00CVB6UXW,"I'm only about 3 or 4 DVD's into this but so far, very impressed. Narrated by Charlton Heston, it's also a joy to listen to. There are 5 x 1hr shows per DVD. The stories vary. Sometimes the producers took poetic license and some clips appear in multiple shows. What did impress me was the quality of the older material. Some was clearly taken from training material or even movies, but even some of the Hitler clips were amazingly clean and crisp. A 1 hour show can sometimes appear to jump around a little but overall the content is wonderful. Explains the war time birth of the pre-CIA and other spy agencies amongst many interesting stories.

Honestly, if you're interested in war time secrets and historical data, it's worth every penny. Talking of which for the cost... I simply do not understand how you can go wrong. This is one of the cheapest box sets I've come across but also one of the most outstanding in quality, information and news reel footage. I would highly recommend this for war buff aficionados.

This is a great addition to a historical collection. Awesome value for the money.",1379289600,148,1100,4.635897435897436
5742572,5,B00CVB6UXW,"I saw two episodes of this series on free-to-air TV and was so impressed by the complete story of the capture of the Enigma machine that I decided to buy the series.  Now after viewing several of the series I am very satisfied with it's information.  Money well spent.

5742582,5,B00CVB6UXW,"Wow! this is one of the best DVD documentary series I've run across. Excellent material, media, packaging, and lots of it.

Narrator Charlton Heston explicates various little-known aspects of all the armed conflicts dating from WWI through the so-called ""First Gulf War"" (which we really should be calling the Kuwait War of 1990-91).  Notable episodes include ""Hitler's Secrets"" which recounts that Stalin's ""Great Purge"" of the Red Army officer corps during 1936-38 happened because the German intelligence service (the Abwehr) leaked information that implicated a high-ranking Soviet general in a fictitious plot to forcibly remove Stalin, and then Stalin went wild with rage. I have not seen this explanation for the Purge anywhere else! This is really outstanding scholarship if it holds up to professional scrutiny (the film series does not cite sources). Also in this SOW episode is a description of Germany's Operation North Pole (in German ""Englandspiel"" or ""England Game""), which seems to be about the only other success of the Abwehr. Again I have not seen this material anywhere else.

Other little-known historical events in the series include the Iraqi ""supergun"" invented by Gerald Bull, the JStars ground surveillance radar aircraft first deployed during the Kuwait War, the supersecret RC-135 Rivet Joint elint jets, the Zimmerman telegram incident, and generally unappreciated details of Rommel's intelligence game in North Afrika.  They even did an episode on Operation Just Cause, the removal of Noriega from power in Panama. Even the episodes having to do with prisoners of war were interesting, though I did not at first think they would be.

About the only little-known historical event of importance I can think of that's absent in this series (if I recall correctly) is the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which convinced the Japanese high command that they shouldn't try to invade Siberia for resources, and instead look to the South Pacific for the resources for their Co-Prosperity Sphere. So, I hope I have convinced you that you'll be really happy with this set if you appreciate the details of modern warfare that historians overlook.

One last thing concerns the build quality of this set. Usually I stay away from these multidisk megasets because invariably not all of them will play correctly in my DVD player. I just want to say that though each disk has more than 4 hours of content, I have played all my disks over and over again for the past 3 years and not a single time did I experience a problem with the show freezing or skipping. Remarkable! The only bad thing here that I must report is that there are no subtitles. But that's not enough to deduct a star, though those who have difficulty hearing will feel otherwise.  BTW this set includes the ""Hitler"" series of episodes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-War-Shadows-of-The-Reich/dp/B00BHLTIT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of War - Shadows of The Reich</a>&nbsp;so don't bother with that.

5742638,5,B00CVB6UXW,"For a history fan, especially of WWII, this is one of the greatest finds there is - at any price, let alone for only $13.00.  It contains essential and much of it little-known information even today, some which was entirely unknown when it was first aired in the 1990's.  It was almost completely unavailable until the last 2 or 3 years, since the time it was aired on the History Channel (back when - what a concept - they used to play shows on history) in the early 2,000's under the title, ""Secrets of War"".
  Since that time it was only available one at a time - at a premium price - from TIME.  A scarce few episodes have been played in the last 2-3 years on The Military channel now called ""American Heroes Channel"" under the title, ""History Exposed."".
 You can tell that this is one of my most favorite series. MY whole interest is how America and the Allies were absolutely saved despite very overwhelming odds.  (Because of the various names that have been used for this series, I didn't even know it was available until last week.  Wow, am I glad.)
 Some of my favorite episodes include:
 -""German Intelligence in WWII"" which contrasts the activities of 2 members of the High Command, one who secretly aided the Allies and one who was a devil.

It really shows politicians, leaders and Generals in a different light once their secrets have been exposed. I suggest we are still kept in the dark today. Governments only inform us of what they consider what we should know, and what we shouldn't.

5742686,4,B00CVB6UXW,"Some of the vintage ""original"" footage leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the observations by the narrator and even the anecdote players seemed scripted by amateurs. Perhaps the series was planned for high school audiences; maybe I have already seen and read too much about WW II to be impressed by the series. It was cheap and I bought it; I guess I got what I paid for.

If WW II is a new topic for you, this might be a way to get a feel for it, but there are many good, some great books about the topics in the 65 episode series which will do a better job of bringing the action to you more vividly even though it's only in black and white print.",1440374400,,650,4.038759689922481

Gives a great lesson in whom not to trust even though you might be on their side.
Life in those days was cheap and it was nothing for the dictators of the day to murder millions of their own to achieve their evil means.
It will take me a while to get through the 65 chapters but so far it has been worth watching.

Informative, it could have easily been retitled little known aspects of the war. Heavy emphasis on OSS and espionage in WWII, which I liked. A few episodes on Vietnam and one or two on Iraq, but this is primarily a World War II compilation.

5742797,4,B00CVB6UXW,"An excellent series. Diverse and detailed look into war of the 20th century.

The box isn't really useful as the DVDs come in paper envelopes and then stacked inside a plastic enclosure in the DVD case. So it's not exactly a user friendly DVD set. The box and storage of the DVDs is what let's the set down. Its cheap and an after thought.

Its dissapointing to see a 10+ DVD set get shoved into a box with the potential to scratch and damage the discs and the envelopes. I can see myself shelling out for a library of cases for each DVD.",1399939200,3,538,4.213592233009709

McCain spoke about his time being a POW in Vietnam. I believe this program is also tought at two of the US Military Academy's for history. A few programs on WW1, A lot on WW2 as well as the Cold War. Many of the people and stories discussed in the cold war are not tought anymore and if you love that part of history, it is a must to own.

I saw that it says on the backside of the dvd set down on the bottom in small print, Discs made in China? I have noticed that some Mill Creek sets are being made in China now. The Quality of the discs are poorer and they seem to have more defects. I have gotten a few bootleg dvd sets by accident that was bought on another site that were made in China and almost every set was in some way defective. I cannot believe Amazon would buy any set that was made in China from a company and if they decided to do so, It should say in the description of the dvd set is made in China. If I would have known, I never would have bought it. Buyer beware of this set and other Mill Creek sets. Check the bottom back of the dvd set when you buy them in store as some are made in China and others are made in the USA. Figure that one out? If you order them online, good luck getting the made in the USA dvd set.",1397433600,27,998,3.873170731707317

5742802,5,B00CVB6UXW,"This is an extremely fascinating and excellent 65 episode series lasting over 54 hours on 13 single sided disks that encompasses much more than World War II secrets.  It covers secrets from World War 1, 2 and Vietnam and more. This series delves deeply into the little things like spying, breaking codes, secret weapons, clever deceptions etc. Its not about the battles although there are battle scenes to illustrate different aspects. Charlton Heston is the outstanding narrator in this series. The video quality is excellent too and old B&W war footage seems enhanced compared to many lesser WW2 series.

Each of the 13 disks in the series has about 5 episodes. Each disk is housed in its own paper jacket and is well protected in the plastic box. There is no need to follow any order when viewing the series. You can play any disk in any order and watch any episode that you may be interested in.  Nothing is really lost if you do that. The series is not available on Amazon or Netflix streaming but if you have Hula plus, the entire series is available for streaming. Even if I used Hula Plus, I would want to own this series. Its a fantastic bargain. The price seems to fluctuate between $13 and $20. I paid $13 but after watching the series so far, its worth more than $20, if you are a ww2 buff.

What you learn from the series is that the successful or unsuccessful outcome of battles often resulted from secret knowledge of the enemies plan of attack, allocation of resources and in many cases outright deception. All these things are covered in interesting and great detail. One secret I found interesting was Germanys early development before 1940 of the worlds first jet plane (on display at the Smithsonian), militarily grade rockets, early cruise missiles, and attempts at developing atomic weapons. Luckily their development was put aside for several years as they started their deadly War that no one wanted.

They fortunately lost the war before they were able to use their superior technology with much effectiveness.  Code breaking which in most war documentaries is glossed over is covered in great detail. Everything is covered and sometimes there is repetition but that is to be expected when covering various facets of the wars.  The series are so well done it's hard to stop watching even after finishing an episode. I don't like to watch any Vietnam War scenes but the secrets show how this war was fought and was unwinnable. An invisible enemy and how it was done.

A little known secret found in Churchills memoir about World War 1 in the 1920s divulged England's capturing German code books that led to Germanys defeat in WW1. The Germans were astonished discover this in his memoir and learned from their mistake and developed the unbreakable Enigma code machine. Was the code unbreakable, absolutely and they believed that to the end of the war and beyond. The biggest secret of WW2 was that the British broke the enigma code using brilliant code breakers, math experts and developed the worlds first working digital computer to accomplish this task. Before Poland was invaded they secretly had access to an Engima Machine for 2 days and Poland secretly shared their information with the British who were allies.  This stuff is extremely fascinating.

The US broke the easier to break Japanese code even before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The episodes will detail just how this was accomplished and give lots of detail and commentary by experts who were involved with the code breaking. One interesting factoid is that the Soviet Union had the best intelligence in the world and even had high level agents working in the US  government. One secret I discovered that changed history is that President Roosevelt was clued that his VP had soviet agents as aids who would have had important positions in government, he dumped his VP and picked Truman as his VP and Roosevelt died 3 months after taking office for the 4th term. How Roosevelt was tipped off is unknown but US history would be very different had this change not have been made.

Watching this series will help you understand why war even by superior powers is unpredictable and powerful diplomacy can produce more predictable results without loss of life and useless destruction.

Inevitably and unfortunately, some of the episodes (mainly concerning the Nazi period) are marred by the still tiresome demonizing of the enemy  -  but as they say, the victors get to write the history.....
