8519072,4,B001KJ2B8Y,"When I bought the DVD, I thought that it was going to teach basic jazz technique and then put it together into a routine. This is not that.

However, if you want to learn choreography and you already know jazz technique, this DVD is appropriate for you. It has three routines for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. The routines are all about two minutes long, and the instruction (break-down of moves) is put into sections of maybe 5 or 6 moves, and it goes by very quickly. You have to pick up the choreography pretty quick, but you can also just repeat the sections until you get it.

If you already know how to dance jazz and just want some new choreography to learn, this would be great for you. However, if you're new to dance, don't pick up new choreography easily, and don't know proper technique. this will not be helpful to you.

This DVD didn't meet my needs, since it isn't marketed toward people with my level of experience. So I cant say much about the quality. I give it a 4 to be fair.",1379894400,4,1009,4.385026737967914
