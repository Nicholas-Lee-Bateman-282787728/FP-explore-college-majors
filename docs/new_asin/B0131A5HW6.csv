8726884,5,B0131A5HW6,"This movie is wonderful with lots of messages!  It is truly inspirational about soldiering through difficult times, aspiring, using God-given talent, and much more.  It is a great family movie.  The movie is a fiction story about the American Boychoir School located in Princeton, New Jersey.  The story is written by a local resident in Princeton.  The soundtrack is sung by the present students attending the American Boychoir School, and Josh Groban sings beautifully as the credits are displayed. Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Eddie Izzard, Kevin McHale, John Lucas, Debra Winger, and Garrett Wareing are great!  It is directed by Francois Girard.  This movie is a must-see!",1455148800,,677,5.271028037383178
