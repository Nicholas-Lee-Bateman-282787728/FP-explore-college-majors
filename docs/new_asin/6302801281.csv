7831612,5,6302801281,"Crash Goes The Hash - In my top five of Curly shorts. Curly turns in one of his best performances as a stooge. The first time we see the ""bird in the turkey"" gag and the ending is one of the best in stooge history, especially watching Larry's reactions in the background. 5 stars

From Nurse to Worse - Another hilarious effort from the boys peak period of the early 1940s. Curly pretending to be nuts to try and collect insurance money is a sure-fire laugh getter. 4 1/2 stars

G.I. Wanna Home - In my opinion, one of the more ""underrated"" shorts, since it came from the year 1946 when Curly was ill. But despite his illness this is still a very funny short & credit must go to Moe and Larry for that, especially those scenes in the stooges outdoor home. Very funny ending too. Curly fans may bash this one but I loved it. 4 1/2 stars

Definitely one of the best 3 stooges tapes you can buy.",1358294400,,892,4.204678362573099
7831613,5,6302801281,"Crash Goes The Hash(1944)-It's an excellent short with alot of scenes. I especiall loved the part where Curly carreis the ice with his and hands and only yells out ""here you are folks"". The turkey routine needs a plot but anyway a nice short.
From Nurse To Worse(1940)-Another excellent short. All the scebes were the best, including Curly's impersonation of a dog at a hospital.
G.I. Wanna Home(1946)-Very funny short. A must see for fans",1045094400,2,439,4.866666666666666
7831614,5,6302801281,"CRASH GOES THE HASH, an excellent short. There is no best scene. All of the short is equally funny. Everyone is at their best here, even the supporting cast. A great short.
FROM NURSE TO WORSE is another excellent short. Once again, all sixteen minutes is zany, fast-paced, and hilarious. There's an excellent chase scene toward the end.
GI WANNA GO HOME is the best short here. I think this is one of the funniest shorts ever made. All of this short is just too funny.
Overall, an excellent tape, with great quality.",1011571200,2,517,4.56989247311828
7831615,5,6302801281,"In my opinion,the episode ""gi wanna home"" is one of the best three stooges episodes ever made. Despite curly's illness i think he did really well and i thought the scenes with Moe and Larry were really hilarious. Another hilarious scene is when Moe and Larry were fighting and Curly came up and he said ""whats all the rumpus"" in which Moe replies(concerning Larry)""I'll rumpus him in a minute"" I thought that was a funny use of the word. I also thought that Moe had some very funny moments especially with the tramp who was trying to rent a room with the stooges. I also liked the scene where they were trying to rent an apartment from a landlord who would only rent to the stooges(i quote) ""from 4 to 5...A.M.!!!  An exceptionally good episode.",1002153600,2,745,4.518518518518518
7831616,4,6302801281,"CRASH GOES THE HASH (1944) - This is a fast-paced, hilarious short, and the boys at their best. The plot has them as newshounds, disguising as butlers and cooks to get a picture of Prince Shaam and Lady Van Bustle (Symona Boniface). This has plenty of funny gags, and the ending is hilarious, even if it has no real ending (the point is that it's funny). Pay attention to Larry's reactions in the background at the end when Curly and Moe are slapping each other around. His reactions are priceless! One of the Stooges' best shorts.
FROM NURSE TO WORSE (1940) - Another gem. Curly goes to an insurance doctor and pretend he's insane as a scam for the Stooges to get some money from the Insurance doctor, but the boys' plan backfires when the doctor actaully wants to operate on Curly's brain!  A creative plot, with a lot of hilarious scenes, especially when Curly's pretending to be a dog in the doctor's office. The great hospital chase towards the end is great, too. I wonder why they reused that one small scene from DIZZY DOCTORS (1937) toward the end. It seemed forced and the boys have to wear the same outfits for the whole short that they wore in DIZZY DOCTORS just so they fit the stock footage.
G.I. WANNA HOME (1946) - First off, to Frank Behrens, who wrote the review for this tape: actually, the video tape cover is correct. There is no ""GO"" in the title, the title is just G.I. WANNA HOME - just watch the short again and pay attention to the title card for yourself, and you'll see. Okay, as for the short - this is a pretty average, nothing special short. The Stooges, after returning from WWII, have trouble finding a house to move into, so they instead move into a vacant lot.  Nothing real outstanding in this short, but some pretty funny scenes, especially when Larry climbs up the tree to get the nest of eggs, only to spill all the eggs on Moe's head.  Then Larry slips off the tree when getting off and falls of top of Moe!",994550400,2,1946,4.415041782729805
