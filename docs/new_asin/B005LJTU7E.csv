I'm excited to see all of their 17 performances on the show, particularly those of ""Paint It, Black,"" ""I (can't get no) Satisfaction,"" and ""Lady Jane,"" which are also my all time favorite Stones' songs!",1316995200,5,313,4.796296296296297

4829097,5,B005LJTU7E,I love this DVD!!  You get all of the stones performances from the 60's on Ed Sullivan.  And it includes a feature where you can just play the performance 1 by 1 bypassing the other performers on the show.  If you like the Stones this is a must have!,1379376000,,250,4.061224489795919

4829099,5,B005LJTU7E,"This thing even has several commercials from the original shows--that alone makes it fascinating.

4829102,5,B005LJTU7E,"The shows bring back many memories, but the appearances by the Stones stand out in my memory.  I guess the one that I will never forget is the shock I had when they sang ""Let's Spend Some TIME Together"".  I did not expect the alteration.

4829106,1,B005LJTU7E,"Watched the first Sullivan show in this set from 10/25/64.  For a live show, it sure looks edited. And apparently it is.  Multiple web sources list the actual guests on this episode.  Missing from the DVD version are Jack Jones and the Cambridge Circus, a proto-Python group with John Cleese and Graham Chapman, among others. What really gives the game away is a segment with Phyllis Diller in which comes out and announces that it's Mothers' Day.  Perhaps rights could not be cleared or sections of the master tape haven't survived well, but this episode at least does not seem to be as it originally aired.  Buyer beware.",1349136000,6,623,4.731481481481482
4829107,5,B005LJTU7E,"It's sometimes nice to relive and reminice certain events in the past. Ed Sullivan was a bit of an oddball but he did have some memorable acts on his show, most notably the Stones. They deliver as expected; however one wonders why they chose to mime to ""Honky Tonk Women"" on their last appearance on the show? Perhaps they had no choice. Perhaps they couldn't be bothered. But they were in the middle of their 1969 US tour so perhaps Ed didn't quite trust them to stick to the script. Still it is impossible to take you eyes of them. And it's great to reminice about those days and wonder what happened to some of the acts you see on the shows. Go on, live a little. Get the 6 shows set.",1344470400,,687,4.212121212121212
4829108,5,B005LJTU7E,"Love these 6 DVD's! Enjoyed watching all of them and reliving the Ed Sullivan show. It was great seeing Tom Jones, Dusty Springfield and other guests! We will be watching these for many years to come!!!",1340236800,,202,4.638888888888889
4829109,5,B005LJTU7E,SOFA Entertainment has expertly done what few documentaries can in this Sullivan and Stones package: bring the viewer back to the place and time Baby Boomers cherished most in CBS programming and afford them the opportunity to relive the unadulterated 'vibe'... when content really was KING; this goes for Sullivan as well as The Stones. SOFA has earned 5 Stars easily with this product.,1338595200,,387,5.0625
4829110,1,B005LJTU7E,I thought these were the original unedited complete episodes.  They're not.  Totie Fields has a segment that only runs 2 and a half minutes.  Shame on them.,1330128000,3,156,4.703703703703703
4829111,4,B005LJTU7E,"I was disappointed in the camera work. I recognize that these shows are old and the standards weren't as high then, but even back then it should have been obvious that if Keith Richards is playing a guitar solo you zoom in on him, not on Bill Wyman looking bored ... unless the music is dubbed and you don't want everyone to notice that the motion of the guitar pick doesn't match the guitar notes very well, which you can see is the case when there is a wide angle shot and the whole band is visible. On Gimme Shelter there are female voices but no females on stage. Also after Gimme Shelter Ed's voice oddly changes character between speaking with Mick Jagger and then moving on to introduce the next act. So I agree with other reviewers that at least some of the songs look and sound dubbed. I want to cry when I think of how much better any performance by any band today is captured on Letterman or SNL.

But even if the music is dubbed and the camera work could have been better I still give 4 stars for being able to watch these historic Stones performances. How bad can that be.

And some of the non Rolling Stones acts are worth having as well; Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Rodney Dangerfield, ...

Another fun element is that the commercials are left in. Some of them are hilariously out of date and politically incorrect.",1327536000,3,1336,4.40080971659919
4829112,5,B005LJTU7E,"I don't understand people who are bored by the acrobats, ventriloquists and various freaks on the Ed Sullivan show. To me it's a fascinating time capsule of an era I vividly remember. Every comedian is bound to do a variation of 'wife can't drive', or 'mother-in-law is crazy' jokes. And the commercials remind you how crappy frozen pizza was in the 1960s. As for the Stones, it's fascinating to see them go from happy go lucky R&B performers in 1964, to decadent, serious artists in 1969. I hope they do more of these complete shows, maybe with a variety of pop artists, especially pre-67 when they were performing live.",1327449600,4,621,4.706422018348624
4829113,5,B005LJTU7E,"As mentioned, the performances themselves are sometimes a bit short and you better be somewhat excited to watch the whole Sullivan Show (commercials and all).

Overall we have enjoyed it though-- a nice collection.",1327190400,,214,5.294117647058823
4829114,3,B005LJTU7E,"The DVD looks great and sounds great. However, I think the producers of the DVD overdubbed Gimme Shelter and I am appalled.

It is well know that the 1969 appearance of the Rollings Stones on the Ed Sullivan show had repercussions from their 1967 appearance and the ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" controversy. I am sure Sullivan did not recognize them at all based on their appearance (Keith Richard was probably the most decadent looking person to ever hit the Sullivan stage).

Sullivan told his engineers to turn the vocals low on Jagger, especially since Gimme Shelter (I am certain they had to give the lyrics to the station for approval) had references to rape and murder. On YouTube, they have their appearance with the vocals low in the mix and obviously the band playing to an alternate take without the backing vocals of Merry Clayton. In the DVD, Jagger's vocals are normal, and Merry Clayton's vocals are back.

Interesting note: that appearance was the last time any real rock group ever appeared on the show. From 1970 on, the musical guests were nearly all pop-MOR like BJ Thomas or the Fifth Dimension, with the exception of occasional Diana Ross-less Supremes and Temptations and Four Tops shows.",1327017600,3,1215,4.859903381642512
4829115,5,B005LJTU7E,"I have been a Rolling Stones fan since 1964, I got all Stones albums, studio or live versions,
I rated this Stones DVD, recorded during the 60's area is the VERY best of all Stones live. Period
Any Stones fan must have this DVD and compare with others, this one, to me ,is even better than their Gimme Shelter DVD.",1325808000,,314,4.25
4829116,5,B005LJTU7E,"I just finished watching the second disc of this broadcast, and it is a slice of America on a Sunday night suburbia in the 60's.  The performances are not the best the stones have done, BUT, you do get to see Brian Jones and understand the influence he had on Jagger and Richards.  He's playing sitar, recorder and is that a dulcimer? Charlie Watts with glasses! The lousy camera angles?  And Mick Taylor's American television debut?  The better performances are on disc 2, but that could be the pre recorded tapes.  The only one singing back up is Keith.

The rest of the shows feature various acts from around the world, which is what ED did best: bring you the international in one hour every Sunday night.  You get to see young comics who we've grown up with.  Joan Rivers, the late Flip Wilson, Rodney Dangerfield and Red Skelton. Robert Klein was just coming into his prime.  Did you catch the promo for the Dick Van Dyke Show?  Then those commercials...making mother's life easier with Aero Wax!

Bottom line, if your old, they'll bring back memories.  If you're young....go play with your X-box.",1325289600,2,1103,4.658031088082901

4829119,2,B005LJTU7E,"After the great set of Ed Sullivan Shows of the Beatles featuring the four originals episodes(but slightly edited of the cigarette commercials and one performance of Mitzi Gaynor edited for whatever reason), the three originals episode of Elvis Presley with magnificiant remasterisation of the picture using VidFire that allows kinescope telerecording to be finally viewed like it was when originaly broadcast in semi video quality. Here we have the six appearances of the Rolling Stones on the Ed Sullivan Show. I don't say originals because it is not the original episodes as broadcast. All of the episodes have something missing here and there, Tom Jones original song in that episode is ""It's not unusual"", not ""Whatcha gonna do about it"" taken from another episode June 13, 1965, Dusty Springfield original song is ""All Cried Out"" not the badly edited second song of a medley taken from an episode of May 1964!!!. The most weird is the Franco Corelli & Renaldo Tebaldi number (replacing a Holiday on Ice segment) in the 1966 episode taken from the week after the appearance of the Rolling Stones and they are announced as such at the end of the Rolling Stones episode. I don't know if they had problems of copyrights or if the Power that Be didn't like the original show but all of the episodes missing pieces and replacing parts here and there. They should have released only their performances instead of theses patchwork of fake episodes. Not a great release by Sofa here.... But the quality is good",1324080000,24,1507,4.890625
4829120,5,B005LJTU7E,"(10 Stars ! )I was hoping for this release for many years. Thank you to have release those Rolling Stones performances in their prime time. There is no equivalence.
And now.....why not the Dave Clark Five ? They performed a total of 12 songs.

4829121,2,B005LJTU7E,hard to be disappointed by the Stones but this was a lot less interesting than I initially thought whe I ordered it. Apart from the novelty of seeing them  at the very start when theya lot yunger this is not worth purchasing alas.,1322697600,2,230,4.348837209302325
4829122,4,B005LJTU7E,"""Mea Culpa"": I have had a boot of the Stones' Ed Sullivan performances for about 8 years now.  Considering the origin of these performances was ALL ""Sixties television,"" I shouldn't complain about the quality not being at all great - but then, I don't have to sit thru Topo Gigo, either.  I had a boot of ""Ladies & Gentlemen,"" but I did ""trade up"" when I bought the new ""refurbished with added enzymes"" 5:1 copy a couple of years ago; so will I be trading up if I purchase this (ahem) ""legitimate"" product?  I mean, it IS ""only"" Rock and Roll, but I STILL love it, yes I do!

4829125,5,B005LJTU7E,"About a month ago, I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Ed-Sullivan-Shows-Starring-The-Rolling-Stones/dp/B005HWAOCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones</a>&nbsp;at another retailer. I enjoyed it, but had I known this expanded version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/6-Ed-Sullivan-Shows-Starring-The-Rolling-Stones/dp/B005LJTU7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones</a>) was going to come out, I would not have purchased the former. This version is the one to get. The Stones are in top form, doing 17 of their 1960s hits from ""Time Is On My Side"" (previously issued on the bonus DVD included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singles-1968-1971/dp/B0007OY3XO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singles 1968-1971</a>&nbsp;box set) to ""Honky Tonk Women."" It's interesting to see how the group and their fans changed in five years; by 1969, they were no longer wearing suits and ties, they were mostly lip-synching, and the audience was not screaming as much.

Although I'm more of a Beatles than a Stones fan, I actually enjoyed these shows more than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-4-Complete-Ed-Sullivan-Shows-Starring-The-Beatles/dp/B003TJ4YU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles</a>, because the supporting acts were much better. If you watch only The Stones' performances, you are missing a lot, including such legends as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald; the great tap dancer Peg Leg Bates; other British Invasion acts such as Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, and Petula Clark; comedy legends Robert Klein, Flip Wilson, Rodney Dangerfield, Joan Rivers, and Phyllis Diller; a young Itzhak Perlman; The Muppets; and so much more. Even the commercials are entertaining! Additionally, the last four shows are in color (the four Beatles shows were all in black and white, and the Fabs' last appearance, taped in August 1965 and broadcast on September 12, was the last Ed Sullivan Show taped in B&W. As Ed announces at that show's end, the first color show was to air the following Sunday (from CBS Television City in Hollywood, to give the technicians time to retrofit Sullivan's New York studio for colorcasts)).

We'll never have shows like this again. They would be too expensive to produce today (for example, most variety shows had full orchestras, either big-band or symphony, plus singing and dancing troupes). Also, in Sullivan's time, there were only three networks (CBS, NBC, and ABC), plus a few independent stations. Public broadcasting, then called educational TV, was in its infancy, and in most markets, was on low-powered UHF stations that few people could receive. Also, most families had only one TV set, and watched television together, making the variety show, with its ""something for everyone"" format, ideal family programming.

In today's fragmented world of cable, satellite, and over-the-air digital TV, there is no way a show like Ed Sullivan's or Carol Burnett's would survive. And much of today's ""entertainment"" is simply too vulgar and crude for a family audience.  Imagine Ed saying, ""And nawww for the youngsterrrs, here is Lady Gaga!"" No way (although Ed would probably love Gaga as a jazz singer with Tony Bennett).

Of course, rock 'n' roll purists who don't care about the other acts should probably stick with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ed-Sullivan-s-Rock-n-Roll-Classics-Boxed-Set/dp/B00006ADZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n' Roll Classics Boxed Set</a>.

I'd like to see the folks at SOFA release more Ed Sullivan volumes - The Supremes would be a logical choice, as would The Dave Clark Five, and some of the non-rock acts as well.",1320451200,10,3943,6.279112754158965
4829126,5,B005LJTU7E,"P.S. Colbert, DVD Verdict --The half-dozen appearances the filthy five made on The Ed Sullivan Show certainly weren't the group's most revelatory television spots--only vocals were performed live, and even those were abetted by pre-recorded backing tracks--but they may have been the most important. Remember this same variety hour formally introduced The Beatles to America, effectively ushering in our second ""British Invasion.""

Just as they did for The Fab Four, the good folks at SOFA Entertainment have packaged the whole kit 'n caboodle of meetings between The Stones and Sullivan (easily the most ill-suited man to ever host a variety show), presenting each episode in its entirety, including commercials for Hai Karate after shave, Aerowax floor shine, ""Medically Tested"" Proslim reducing pills, Vivarin Stimulant Tablets, and the occasional health advisory: ""If you're not taking color pictures with the new Polaroid Colorpak camera, there's something being left out of your life.""

You wanna know what America looked like on a Sunday night in 1964, 1966, and 1969? This package has that and more, all brilliantly restored and as easy to navigate as a magic carpet ride.

4829127,3,B005LJTU7E,"Sullivan was great. His show is a little dated, and corny, but as for the stones themselves, this is a historical record at best. Their perfomances are a bit lame, come on ""Let's spend SOME TIME together? Jim Morrison didn't compromise his integrity when the Doors played Sullivan. These shows are for die hards only.",1319587200,5,317,4.781818181818182
4829128,1,B005LJTU7E,"I seem to be the first baffled reviewer thus far.  Five stars?  Come off it!

Obviously, live performances by the Rolling Stones from the mid to late 60's are essential...but did the producers have to force us to sit through all of the other stuff as well?  The ""Ed Sullivan Show"" was all but unwatchable...I know.  I grew up avoiding it!  The only times worth watching were when Elvis and the Beatles appeared.  I didn't even KNOW that the Stones appeared on the show this often (like I said, I avoided it like the plague).  Topo Gigio?  Ughhhh!

""The Beatles 1st US Visit"" could have been released in the very same fashion....thank heavens it wasn't.

Hopefully, the Stones appearances on Sullivan will ultimately be released without the rest of this junk....I'll wait till then.

I hope others will do the same...",1319155200,14,816,4.709219858156028

Now...we can see Mick roll his eyes when doing Lets Spend Some *Time* Together to pacify the censors and Sullivan.  Funny, I've seen reviews about that clip and they say he rolls his eyes for the absuridity of the lyric.  WELL.....you should have done like Morrison did months later - just sing the word(s)!

Maybe this set will be a continual thing.  First The Beatles, now The Stones.  Nice time capsule to show how music really was and how special it STILL is.",1317945600,9,721,4.72

4829131,5,B005LJTU7E,"For some reason only four of these shows were collected in a set that was released in october, but THIS is the one you will want. This is the one you can't do without if you are even remotely interested in the music of The Rolling Stones, as these are very, very fine performances of a lot of their greatest hits played and broadcasted when they were hits (or just before that), and there unfortunately is not a lot of good quality video material available from that era. You can enjoy the Stones when they themselves still had no idea that over 4 decades later they would still be the greatest band ever and, especially when you watch these shows in chronological order and in their completeness, see how they stood out between the other, most of them now highly dated performers from that era even at their first appearance in the Ed Sullivan show and grew in their confidence even more throughout that decade. It is always great to see the Stones complete with Bill Wyman and, although Ronnie Wood is by far the best replacement -even preferred by me- Brian Jones. He plays some interesting instruments here and it even might make some who don't agree with me on the Ronnie subject admire this man for filling the gap Brian left. It's wonderful to see Mick's eyes roll when he delivers the censored words ""some time together"" instead of ""the night together"", already showing how weirdly twisted and hypocritically prudish American National Television was already (something not changed in 5 decades of ""progress"" as we saw when a word that is also used for naming a rooster was edited out of a slightly delayed live broadcast of the World Series when the Stones performed there a few years ago).
With not only the superb Stones performances but the entire shows presented this set is like a time capsule that can be used (as Leanard Maltin suggests we do with ""uncensored"" Disney shorts from the first half of the last century) to show to and talk about with our kids, so they can learn ""how far we have come today"", or much better of course to just enjoy them for the silliness of some acts, the quality of others, and in any case the sheer entertainment they present. And for the Stones, naturally.

So much beautiful stuff for a price that would be more than fair fow even only a single disc with only the Rolling Stones performances this is the best buy money can get you.",1317427200,20,2379,4.558411214953271

This is exactly what we all experienced every Sunday evening on CBS, in between Walt Disney & Bonanza; which were on different networks if memory serves correct.  What makes this exceptional is that it is both entertaining & history.  The entire family sat through them all.  You had to watch the acts aimed at our parents.  And your parents had to watch the acts that were aimed at the little kids or the teenagers.  What I would love to see is more DVD sets made available that have the Ed Sullivan Show in its entirety (including commercials) from the nights a particular group performed.  I already have Elvis & The Beatles of Ed Sullivan.  Just wish there were others.",1464998400,,707,4.6

8478179,5,B005LJTU7E,"I bought one of the new ones for $26 and it was well worth it. The quality is as good as it can be. The Ed Sullivan Show was the most watched American variety show in the 60s. That the Stones were on it six times is historically important for them and people at home, just as with the Beatles first appearance. The early shows are truly live, and the liner notes in the DVD explain what wasn't live later on (vocals were live, not the instruments). I thought the liner notes were well written and you definitely want to read them.

Someone below says some of the other acts are not in in the right year or the show isn't in its entirety. The Stones dates are definitely correct. I don't know about the others but they are generally in the right years because if it's in black and white it is before the color shows that started in late 1965. The Ed Sullivan show ran from 1948-1971, but these are all 60s acts. But each episode on the DVD *is* 50 minutes which is how long the show was on TV. There also are likely copyright reasons for this as SOFA entertainment would have to pay for them and only be allowed so much since the ES Show sells DVD sets.

Either way, I enjoyed seeing the other acts and commercials regardless of order. (Nice when commercials were short!) The Rolling Stones and the other British Invasion bands in the early 60s were modern rock and roll. And damn, Mick Jagger was so cute. (:",1414108800,2,1408,4.269662921348314
