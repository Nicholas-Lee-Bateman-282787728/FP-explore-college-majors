approximately 1 hour 40 minutes

Leslie Nielsen is known as a great comedy actor and most of his roles since the 1980s are basically versions of his Frank Dreben character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Squad/dp/B000H7JCFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Squad!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-Gun/dp/0792166469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked Gun</a>&nbsp;series.  This movie is from before that time period, and he actually shows his acting chops in a serious role.  He plays a journalist named Harry Walsh.

After an auto accident involving a U.S. Senator, Walsh shows up at the scene to get the scoop.  The senator's body is in critical condition and sent to the best hospital in the area.  Walsh stays at the hospital so that he can report on the senator's situation, but is told that the senator never arrived at the hospital.  To make matters worse, Walsh discovers that his story is being pulled because there are reports that the senator is having a great time on a fishing trip in another state.

This leads Harry Walsh on a mission to find out the true whereabouts of the senator.  It is not long before he discovers that he is being followed.  Meanwhile, we see how the Senator Wheeler has miraculously recovered and eager to get back out into the world.  However, he isn't fishing and we discover that his release is conditional.  One of the nurses he speaks with is played by Angie Dickinson, who  is most famous for her starring role in the television show '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Woman/dp/B000E1EHPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Woman</a>'.

This movie deals with notions about when the right time to die is & who gets to decide what kind of life is worthwhile.",1266451200,2,1921,5.888086642599278
7908023,2,B00000FD6K,"I just watched the VHS version of this film, and I must say that if the quality were 20% better, it would be poor! The transfer(?) of this film is amateurish at best. It is nearly unwatchable. Showcase Productions should move out of the garage they use and actually rent a building for their film transfers. I could never recommend anyone to get this VHS cassette. The print itself is only fair to begin with, so the whole effect is terrible. The story is okay, but the transfer and film quality ruin a good premise. ATwo stars is generous, I think!",1140393600,2,549,4.445544554455446
