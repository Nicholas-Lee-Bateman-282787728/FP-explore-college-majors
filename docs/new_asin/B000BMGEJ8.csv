2423954,5,B000BMGEJ8,My children LOVE this video!  We have several of the sing-a-long videos and this is without a doubt their favorite.  The dogs are adorable in this show!,1169164800,,152,4.592592592592593
2423955,5,B000BMGEJ8,"We purchased Pongo and Perdita for our granddaughter who is two years old and she loves it. It is professionally produced with lots of action, songs and lots of dogs!",1163203200,,166,4.566666666666666
2423956,5,B000BMGEJ8,While the first DVD was received damaged; the replacement was in excellent condition.  It was received in an extremely timely manner. Thank you.,1141776000,,144,5.260869565217392
2423968,5,B000BMGEJ8,"Let me clarify...I don't love this DVD, but my 2 young children do. Do yourself a favor: purchase ALL of the singalong DVDs (and VHS if you still own a VCR). My one and 2-year old love every single one of them. If you are not already familiar with the process, let me explain it to you. You put the DVD (or tape) in and for the first and last time in your life, it will be all new to you. Your kids will be interested in it, but may walk away or lose interest after a little while. Then, they'll ask for you to put it on again. And again. And again. And again. You will be purchasing back-up and/or replacement DVDs but you will actually be happy about it because your children love these darn things THAT much, and you get the dishes done, and the laundry and you may even get to have dinner. In peace. This DVD is one of my ""favorites"" (I use this term VERY loosely, they are all pretty awful). The Disneyland DVD is probably the best (holds the kids interest most) followed by the Beach Party and the Animal Kingdom (lots of animals). My one year old has a particular interest/obsession with the Campout right now. Best money ever spent. Of course, the non-live action ones are great too (and FAR better for adult viewing). Just buy all of them. Seriously. I have no stake in Disney or anything, I am just that grateful. Plus, you can earn Disney Rewards points on the DVDs which is a good deal considering their low cost. Thank you Disney!",1488931200,4,1443,4.2700729927007295

2423986,5,B000BMGEJ8,"I'm suprised how much my daughter loves this movie. She just turned 4 and loves dogs and 101 Dalmatians. This movie is a story by itself it's not the dalmations story or any other disney story more of a children's show starring real dalmation dogs and other dogs. Think Barny but a real dog character, yes it's that annoying and dated but little kids love it. I say it's good for 2-4 year olds.

2423989,2,B000BMGEJ8,Young children might like watching other children dancing around and interacting to music but it will probably drive parents crazy to watch this. Young children might enjoy seeing the live puppies but this is NOT a typical Disney Sing-Along. This DVD does NOT include clips from Disney movies like the rest of them I've seen.

For the first couple songs the dogs are featured, and then it gets a little weird at the Bow Wow Ball and becomes all about dancing kids. This is more of a 3.5 star video, but I rounded up because if you kids like dogs then this may be worth it.",1387324800,,402,4.166666666666667

2424020,2,B000BMGEJ8,"I really prefer the more traditional Disney Sing Along videos.  This was just ok - but I was kind of annoyed that they mess up the lyrics to some great kid songs so that they go with the ""theme"".  I don't really want my kid growing up singing the wrong lyrics to those common classic songs that I grew up knowing the words to.  She seems to like the video ok, but I'm almost too annoyed to put it on for her.

I couldn't decide between a 2 and a 3, but overall, I wouldn't have purchased this if I'd been able to preview it.",1384128000,,524,3.961904761904762

2424031,2,B000BMGEJ8,My 21 month old son loves Disney Sing Along Videos. We must have at least 10 of them in our DVD collection. This one is one of his least favorites. It's all live action and a doesn't keep his attention well.,1358553600,,207,4.073170731707317

2424033,5,B000BMGEJ8,"My daughter has loved music from day one, so I was excited to introduce her to Disney Sing-Alongs early. I bought this when she was 5 months old. The first time we watched it, I was so disappointed. It's nothing like the Disney Sing-Alongs I remember when I was small. It felt incredibly cheesey. My daughter had no interest. I thought I'd wasted my $5.
But by 8 months old, my daughter was addicted to this, and I had come to like it a lot too. We were watching it a few times a week then, and it was the only thing that could keep her still for more than a minute or two. Now, at 13 months, I have to limit her to watching once a day. She gets so excited when she sees the DVD case, and she has the thing practically memorized. She knows all the cues that one of her favorite songs is about to come on, and she'll jump up and grab my hands to start dancing together.
As an added bonus, the property on which this video was filmed is gorgeous. During different songs, you can catch glimpses of a pretty breathtaking view looking down on the Pacific coast.",1355529600,,1056,4.15609756097561

2424035,2,B000BMGEJ8,"We have all the original Sing Alongs, up until the Lion King, on VHS for my older kids.  We have a toddler and I wanted him to be able to watch them like his brothers did.  I found some on DVD and quickly bought them.  He fell in love and wants to watch them all the time.  I was getting tired of hearing the same few all the time so I decided to buy the camping one that I had refused to buy before because it wasn't all Disney songs.  He loved it because Mickey and the gang were in it.  I decided to try this one thinking that it would be the same way.  It wasn't!  It starts out with the slowest Zip A Dee Doo Dah I've ever heard.  It then tells a story which is not like the other one.  I don't think that my 21 month old gets that it is even Disney because it is just dogs, not even the cartoon of 101 Dalmatians.  I've tried putting it on for him a few times and he won't watch it.  The first time was in the car and he turned his head and looked out the window.  It was a waste of money.",1341964800,3,995,3.748792270531401

It is history repeating itself! He wants to watch it over and over and over. He loves it and it gives me 20 minutes to clean up the kitchen. It gets irritating after awhile which is why I gave it 4 stars but children truly enjoy it and it beats some other dvds/shows I won't name here.,1327017600,3,439,3.943820224719101

2424038,5,B000BMGEJ8,"My 2 year old LOVES this video...our daycare provider owns it, and they were watching it one day...he started crying because he wanted to keep watching it.  Daycare ended up buying it for him for his birthday.  He asks for ""Pongo""--and he will SIT for the 30 or so minutes this video lasts--this is amazing to me, as he does not sit still for more than 2 minutes and has an attention span the size of a gnat.

Yes--for adults or older kids, this video is seriously annoying and obnoxious.  But toddlers will LOVE it, more often than not.  If I can get my son to sit for 30 minutes to give me time to do the dishes, clean the counters, get dinner started, or just relax with a magazine for a bit, then I can tolerate the annoying songs in the background!",1322611200,,753,4.2377622377622375

It is cheesy with the kids and some scenes, but it wasn't made for me. It makes my little one sit still long enough for me to clean or cook and not ""get in my hair"" (you have to see the video to get that quote! wink)so it's perfect for us!

As I am a Grandma now, I had to have this video for my girls so I even called my Sister In Law in hopes that we could remember the name. Needless to say we found it on Amazon (now in DVD) and I had to have it. The girls love it and even my daughter(she's graduating from high school this year) sat down to watch it with them and boy did it bring back memories. Just to clarify, my grandkids belong to my much older son. Well now you know my story, I hope it tells you how much I think of this video.

Unlike the older Sing Along discs that I remember from my youth, this is not a compilation of scenes and songs from classic Disney movies, but wretchedly thrown together camp songs and original travesties. The ""nanny"" looks terrible in dalmatian-print everything to the point of scary, and the songs are so annoying that we found ourselves fast-forwarding half-way through songs because we couldn't stand it anymore. Undoubtedly small children will have fun singing the Hokey Pokey, etc., but such material is plentifully available on cheap cds and television without paying Disney prices.",1239062400,3,745,5.114754098360656

The kids have all seen the movies and they love to sing a long to the songs they all know and love.  This dvd however is different.  It has nothing to do with the movie!  I only recommend this movie for very small children that like shows like Barney.  It uses real dogs and people which make it ""lame"".  I was very disapointed.  I expected something more like the 101 Dalmation movie.  The dogs in this movie are ""too real"".  I want to see them singing and dancing.  The main human character is really lame and looks dumb.

He was mesmerized with it.  He tries to sing the songs and points out the doggies' actions, whether it's making coffee or ""doggies sleeping.""  He says, ""Watch doggies?""  He was recently in the hospital with a broken leg and we made sure to bring this DVD to keep him occupied.  I definitely recommend this to parents.",1215216000,,652,4.278688524590164
2424048,5,B000BMGEJ8,"My children who are now both near 30, loved this video when they were young. I Recently pruchased it for my 3 year old granddaughter and she enjoys it just as much as her mom did. Actually, I love to watch and sing-a-long too.",1211414400,3,226,4.159090909090909
2424049,5,B000BMGEJ8,"I have 2 daughters who LOVE this DVD.  They're 2 & 4.  We've had this movie more than a year and they still pick it out of their huge stack of DVDs to watch.  The setting it totally bright, sunny, & happy.  The songs are well-known & easy to sing.  The kids are great in it & the dogs are even better!  Given a choice, I'd watch this before Barney any day!!",1207872000,,357,3.888888888888889
2424050,5,B000BMGEJ8,"We bought this on VHS when our daughter was 18 months old. We watched it daily for two years or more. She used to cry when it ended, until we convinced her that she could watch it again if she wanted! Needless to say, we wore out that video tape.

This one is watchable by parents and children. The production value is high, the children are adorable, and the dogs and puppies perform extremely well. It is the live dalmations that make this such an enjoyable tape-if your toddler likes dogs and puppies, this will be a winner.

P.S., this is a quality program you won't mind your child watching over and over. It is not an ad for toys or Disneyland.",1195776000,5,650,4.319672131147541

2424052,5,B000BMGEJ8,"We bought this for our twin daughters at 17 months and they just love it.  It is certainly one of their favorites.  We can turn the DVD on and they start clapping with excitement!!!  I have to admit that as parents--we roll our eyes in parts of it, but we know that this is made for children and they truly love it.  We own just about all the sing alongs and this is top 2 in their book!  The dogs are very talented and the music is fun and gets them laughing and dancing.",1185753600,10,472,3.978723404255319

8088949,5,B000BMGEJ8,"I am rating this one from my toddler daughter's perspective. She absolutely loves this sing along. She is a real animal lover, especially dogs, and this movie keeps her attention very well. I recommend this sing along for any kid who loves dogs. In comparison with other sing alongs, I have to say I enjoy the other ones more than this one, as do my other kids, but in my little girl's eyes, this one is a real winner!",1518998400,,418,4.30379746835443

8088954,3,B000BMGEJ8,I hate it. My daughter loved it. Not your traditional Disney sing along. It's all dogs and painful to listen to. Your kids will love it but spare yourself and get any other one instead. I love all the sing a long we have except this.,1499731200,,233,4.086956521739131
