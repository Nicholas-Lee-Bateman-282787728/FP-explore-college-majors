3527783,5,B001D8W7EA,"If you own Universal's Masterpiece Collection and Warner Brothers' Signature Collection, then you'll need this set for your Hitchcock DVD collection. Also of great quality is the early film box called 'Alfred Hitchcock Box Set'(of course there are 52 available of his 53 total feature films to collect - but, you'd have 36 of them in great quality)There are also many, many other box sets out there for sale cheap that have his early films in public domain crappy 16mm prints. Avoid these if you can afford to-they suck!

Most collectors probably already have the grossly expensive but quality Criterion releases of Rebecca, Notorious and Spellbound. These have been OOP for years and are still available if you want to spend the cash. Rebecca alone usually cost more than this whole set. The other titles have been around on  DVD's in various qualities, some much better than others.

I usually would not be reviewing something I have yet to see to compare the quality. However, I feel safe in guessing that since this is a major studio release and judging by the bonus features and length of time it took to get this set out, it should be the definitive source for U.S. customers. I will update this review once I have looked at the films to compare picture and sound quality.

***UPDATE***

Now that I have it in hand, here's my initial thoughts. The packaging is very nice indeed. It's a bit taller than regular DVD cases, and sticks out a couple inches past normal on the width. It's really cool, though, see the other reviews on box design, etc. I did notice some minor scratches on a couple discs when I took them out. Be very careful and lift the cardboard slightly as you slide them out, or put them in seperate cases.

I have compared picture quality with some Criterion and Region 2 box copies I have. Every title is as good or better looking than anything I've seen before. Especially the earlier titles. The Lodger is really nicely restored, slowed down, and has 2 music scores. Sabotage and Young & Innocent look great, too. Lifeboat is the same as the Fox stand alone version. The 4 Selznick titles look sharp and have most of the bonus features of Criterion issues, plus some new ones.

Bottom line: For about $10 per title, it's a no-brainer. For the true fan it is a must buy, in my opinion.",1217980800,25,2309,4.617073170731707

Rebecca, Spellbound and Notorious will also be available as single discs. The following is the press release for the set:

Lifeboat (1944)
After their ship is sunk in the Atlantic by Germans, eight people are stranded in a lifeboat, among them a glamorous journalist , a tough seaman, a nurse and an injured sailor. Their problems are further compounded when they pick up a ninth passenger - the German captain from the U-boat that torpedoed them. With its powerful interplay of suspense and emotion, this legendary classic is a microcosm of humanity, revealing the subtleties of man's strengths and frailties under extraordinary duress. Nominated for three Academy Awards, Alfred Hitchcock's World War II drama, is a remarkable story of human survival.

The Lodger (1927)
One of the best silent films still in existence has no extra features? I know it was previously only available in the public domain, so believe me, I'm thankful, but nothing?
Story synopsis: A serial killer is seeking blonde girls as his victims in London. A strange lodger moves into a rented room. The man goes out on foggy nights, keeps a photo of an unidentified blonde girl in his room, and flirts with the landlady's daughter, Daisy, who just happens to be blonde. Daisy's boyfriend is a police detective, and jealousy arouses his suspicion more than it might normally be stirred.

Notorious (1946)
Daughter of an accused World War II traitor, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is enlisted to entrap one of her father's colleagues in Brazil, Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains). Her American contact, secret agent T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) is openly contemptuous of Alicia and instructs her to wed Sebastian. It is only after she is wed that Devlin lets himself admit that he's fallen in love with her.

All of these films have either been in the public domain, gone out of print entirely, or been available only as expensive individual entries in the Criterion collection. It is good to have them all together at an affordable price and loaded with extras.",1217721600,41,5730,5.600461893764434
3527785,5,B001D8W7EA,"It's about time these films were released on dvd at a reasonable price. Included are every film Hitch made with producer David O. Selznick plus four other greats. All the films in this collection have been previously released either in the public domain (THE LODGER, SABOTAGE, YOUNG AND INNOCENT)or OOP Criterion Collection (REBECCA, SPELLBOUND, NOTORIOUS). Note: LIFEBOAT and THE PARADINE CASE were not part of any previous collection. Not only are all eight of these classics in one collection, each film is remastered!

REBECCA is truly a classic in every sense of the word. This marked Hitch's first film in America and proved to be a tremendous sucess, taking home the coveted Best Picture Academy Award of 1940. The film stars Sir Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, and Judith Anderson, all of whom recieved Oscar Nominations for acting.
The other highlights in this collection include NOTORIOUS starring Cary Grant & Ingrid Bergman, SPELLBOUND with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, and Hitch's little known classic, SABOTAGE starring Sylvia Sidney.

3527796,3,B001D8W7EA,"Sabotage, 1936 film

The film begins in London at night. Suddenly the lights go out due to a power failure. Could a simple substance like silicon dioxide sabotage a big city? A blackout in peacetime? Will the patrons of the cinema get their money back? Mr. Verloc seems unconcerned. He is the owner operator of this small business, its not a big corporation. Is the grocer next door too interested in the cinema? Do terrorists stir up trouble at home so people ignore foreign news? Or is that how the news is played. Verloc meets his controller who asks him to leave a ""parcel"" at Piccadilly Circus to terrorize the population. Ted befriends Mrs. Verloc and her son at a restaurant. Verloc is under surveillance, they know who he meets and where he goes. The talk in the movie is meant to be ironic.

Ted notices friends of Verloc going into the cinema. [A great place for surreptitious meetings.] Ted is known to one of the conspirators, the operation is cancelled. [Undercover operatives should never be part of official operations.] Ted returns to question Mrs. Verloc. Verloc sees this and decides to use her son to carry the ""parcel"" along with some movie reels to avoid surveillance. Stevie walks through the London crowds on his destination. A parade through the streets delays him while time marches on. [There is always the unexpected in any plan.] The suspense comes from knowing the people in the film are oblivious to the danger that is around them. There is bad news!

Verloc blames others for his actions. A cartoon serves as an echo on the events. A mistake leads to rough justice, Verloc will not talk about this conspiracy. Ted and Mrs. Verloc have bonded. The police arrive to arrest the bomb maker and Verloc, but do not succeed. The film tries to create a happy ending; it doesn't work. This story about terrorists with bombs is not obsolete today. This film is adapted from Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent"". Was the novel better? Plots by anarchists were a danger from the end of the 19th century. Was there a similar threat in more recent times? Note the very large crowd scenes, you won't see this in later movies.

Perhaps you should know the background of this time (the Great Depression, the growing power of fascist movements) to best appreciate this story. Hitchcock's later films were better (less censorship?). Note his recurring interest in films about people who are not as they seem.",1428364800,,2418,4.75

3527807,5,B001D8W7EA,"I hesitated for a long time to purchase this set, because so many reviewers mentioned problems with DVDs freezing and skipping.  Finally, I took a chance when an Amazon-affiliated merchant was selling a brand-new set very cheaply; I figured that if even two of the films I wanted (those being impossible or very expensive to get separately) would play without skipping, I would get my money's worth and wouldn't have to return the set.  I was pleasantly surprised.  All 8 DVDs have played without freezing or skipping on my Toshiba DVD/VCR combo player.  The special features as well as the films all play perfectly.

The films are all nicely cleaned up for DVD, and all of them are the full length listed on the IMDb, except for The Paradine Case, which is 114 minutes rather than 125 minutes.  Whether there is a longer DVD or VHS version of the Paradine Case in existence, I do not know (and would welcome comments about it).  The full version of The Lodger (100 minutes) is particularly appreciated, as up until this edition I don't think one was available.

The special features are mostly excellent.  There is a fair bit of repetition in the themes and ideas discussed in the commentaries, which is to be expected as all the films discussed are by Hitchcock and so discussions of his technique, personal anecdotes, etc. tend to crop up more than once.  There are some wonderful interviews with Hitchcock and other special short features, stills, posters, trailers, etc.

The ""Big 4"" -- Rebecca, Spellbound, Notorious, and The Paradine Case -- are deserving of their high reputation (though I think The Paradine Case is often underrated, and Notorious overrated); however, the pleasant surprise on this set is that the lesser-known films are excellent as well, in some cases arguably as good or better than the more famous ones.  The Lodger requires the usual adjustment needed for silent films before it can be appreciated; but once one allows oneself into the silent frame of mind, it repays viewing, and as the commentary shows, is just as artistically careful as Hitchcock's later works.  Sabotage is grim but excellent; Young and Innocent combines lightness with seriousness in an engaging way; and Lifeboat is a masterpiece, perhaps the best film in the whole collection.

The packaging is handsome, and unique.  The DVDs are usually rather tightly tucked into cardboard sleeves inside a fancy color booklet, and some people have worried that they could be scratched in trying to pry them out, but if you work them out carefully, that doesn't happen.  The opposite problem is more of a concern; some of the DVDs are loose in their sleeves when the package arrives (perhaps due to shipping movements), and if you happen to open the booklet upside down, the loose ones could fall onto the floor.  So make sure you have the booklet right-side up when you open it.  (Which means you should be careful the way you slide it out of the hard plastic case that surrounds it.)

If you get a working set of DVDs with this collection, and you don't already own any of these films, even $100 would be a reasonable price (only $12.50 per film, including great extras).  But of course, I cannot guarantee that others will be as lucky as I was with perfect DVDs, and I don't think this item is being manufactured any longer, so replacing the whole set will not be possible if there is a problem.  One would have to buy individual DVDs to replace defective ones.  But that might not be a bad idea, if one gets a good deal on the set.  Some of the films cannot be found anywhere else, or cost a fortune to buy by themselves; if those ones don't skip or freeze, they alone make the set worth having.",1391212800,2,3691,4.70606531881804

3527811,5,B001D8W7EA,"I purchased this set for about $60 from an Amazon Marketplace vendor. I had read all of the reviews about people having major problems with the discs, but I contacted the seller in advance, and she agreed that if the set was defective in any way, she'd issue a partial refund. I took the chance and I'm very glad that I did, as all of the DVDs have played perfectly for me, and they represent an excellent value at the price I paid.

The problems with discs in this set were widely reported by users, not just in Amazon reviews, but on other websites. It's unfortunate that MGM didn't address the issue immediately, because it leaves the potential buyer in an awkward position. Almost everyone agrees about the high quality of both the films themselves and the restorations, which only makes the issue of defective DVDs all the more frustrating for Hitchcock fans.

The restorations for all the films are very impressive, with image and audio quality that range from very good to excellent, depending on the age and quality of the source materials. Equally impressive are the commentaries and extra features that accompany each film. It is a mystery why MGM would have spent the time and money on such meticulous restorations and such complete sets of extra features, and then botch what should have been the easiest and least expensive part of the process with poor quality control in disc manufacturing.

Some reviewers also complained about the packaging, but I didn't find it to be a problem. The set comes in a lightweight clear plastic slipcase, which protects the heavier gauge plastic box that contains a loose-leaf book containing the DVDs themselves, as well as printed pages about each film. The book is relatively sturdy, and each DVD is housed in a slide-in page that some people didn't like, but worked fine for me. I had no trouble removing the DVDs without scratching or other issues. I do agree with people who complained that the packaging could have been done better, and I don't really see why MGM didn't just put each disc in a slimline DVD case which would go into a box case, which would have probably cost less than the book. The printed material could have been put into a booklet. Still, the packaging isn't nearly as bad as some people have said.

The only problem is that the price of this set has skyrocketed, making it a much less attractive deal, especially since you have no way of knowing if the DVDs will work for you or not.  The current lowest price on Amazon for a new copy of this set is about $200. Whether it's worth that much depends on whether or not you want all 8 films, and if you don't, which ones you do want.

Three of these films have now been released in Blu-Ray transfers that use the same restorations included here. The Blu-Rays are the three most famous of the films: ""Rebecca,"" ""Spellbound,"" and ""Notorious."" These Blu-Rays are now the definitive versions for all three films, offering a noticeable upgrade over the already excellent DVDs available in this set. The DVDs for these three films are also still available separately (look for the 2008 remastered versions if you go for the DVDs), but the cost of the Blu-Rays is currently not that much higher than the DVDs.

That leaves the other five films. While all of them were originally available separately, the price of four of them (""The Lodger,"" ""Sabotage,"" ""Young and Innocent,"" and ""The Paradine Case"") is very high, in the range of $25-$70 each, depending on the film. ""Lifeboat"" is available at a reasonable price, and is the same version offered in this set. A rough estimate for the total cost for the 5 films not available as Blu-Rays is $190, and if you then add the estimated cost of $35 for the 3 Blu-Rays, you're well over the current cost of $200 for this set.

Of course, there's still the issue of whether or not the DVDs will be defective. I was lucky, as were some other reviewers here on Amazon, but if you do decide to buy this set, you should find out how the seller handles refunds for defective media before you purchase.

It's unlikely that MGM will release the lesser known films in this set as Blu-Rays, and I also doubt that we'll see them any time soon as reissued DVDs, so if you're interested in these movies, it makes sense to get them while they are still available, even at relatively steep prices.",1360454400,5,4341,4.619974059662775

3527816,3,B001D8W7EA,"I bought this DVD boxed-set used a few weeks ago despite the fact that from what I've read on the internet almost everybody who bought it are complaining about various problems, from the discs who are not easy to pull out to errors during the manufacturing process who make them unwatcheable. Because of that I decided to buy a used one, I figured it would be cheaper and they wouldn't sell something broken. The set was originally packaged in a hard plastic sleeve, the one I received was badly broken and had been repaired using plastic tape... I decided to throw it away out of respect for Alfred Hitchcock and keep only the booklet containing the discs... I tried a few discs, watched one movie completely and I didn't have any problems at all, however it's true that the discs could possibly be damaged since they must be pulled out of the paper cardboard protection sheet and thus are at risk of being scratched each time. The biggest problems with this boxed set are among other things the visual and audio quality of each movie, since they were all made before 1946 I don't know if it would be possible to improve the quality much since the original films could be in poor condition, in any case it's quite apparent that not all of them has been restored... Also all movies are presented in a 1:33 ""Pan & Scan"" aspect ratio, I can't believe a movie like ""Notorious"" who was made in 1946 had not been originally filmed in 16:9 Widescreen format... The selection of movies is possibly among the most average pictures Alfred Hitchcock ever did, we're extremely far from classics like ""The Birds"" or ""Rear Window""... So far I watched only the movie ""Notorious"" with Cary Grant, it's not even as good as the already average ""Suspicion""... I also watched a few minutes of ""The Lodger: A Story of The London fog"", who is a silent movie made in 1927 and produced by the company ""Gainsborough Pictures""... The really positive point of this boxed-set seem to be the monstruous quantity of supplemental material available on each discs, I didn't watched any of them yet but there's radio plays directed by Alfred Hitchcock, many audio interviews with Peter Bogdanovich and Francois Truffaut, and featurettes like ""The Gothic World of Daphne Du Maurier""... Movie enthusiasts should buy that set even if just because of these... The booklet also contain some great facts about each movies and is worth reading after seeing it... Overall it's a collection of decent movies with a lot of extras, I don't believe Alfred Hitchcock would have ever made a movie rated below ""5"" out of ""10"" so not worth watching, but unless someone is a movie enthusiast or a fan of his work I'm not sure at all that I would recommend it, especially for 59$... In any case the right thing to do is buy the ""Alfred Hitchcock Masterpieces Collection"" first, when someone have bought every interesting movies (like ""The Wrong Man"" or ""Dial M for Murder"") then he can buy this boxed set... The only thing left to buy after that are the silent movies...",1332979200,,3020,4.678571428571429

No.  This may or may not be a great collection, but who can tell? The first movie we tried, Rebecca, skipped and froze so badly---at the climax of the movie, incidentally---that we could not finish watching it on any sort of player.  Examining the disk, we found a small chip at the edge.  And every one of the other 7 disks in the set had a similar chip, or uneven thickness, or a sort of gluey residue; we didn't think it worth our time to try watching them.

The shoddy (and wasteful) packaging is consistent with the defects.  The disks come in a notebook; only paper protects the top half of each disk from the top half of the following disks.  The disks are hard to extract from the notebook, creating another hazard.  The whole notebook is enclosed in an annoying, flimsy cardboard wrapper, which in turn is enclosed in cheap clear plastic.  Fast food is wrapped better than this.

We have been Amazon customers for many years and have NEVER had the slightest cause to return a product until now.  Nor have we ever encountered another DVD, new or used (except an obviously cracked one), from any source whatsoever, that was absolutely unplayable.

Shame on Fox/MGM for its abysmal production standards.

If you need only 4 or 5 of these 8 movies and none of them is the somewhat expensive Paradine Case, it might be better to buy them individually in some other edition.",1325635200,7,1515,4.587360594795539

Not sure how Amazon got so many bad reviews on this set, but I can assure you that the original pressings were playable even if the packaging did cause a few scuffs here and there.  Would love to see companies abandon these paper or cardboard sleeve designs.  I'd much rather have the stacked version offered in the Universal set even though I know there are many people who despise those.  It seems to me that sub-par quality DVD sets get better packaging, and re-release (upgrade) or complete sets/series get the worst available.",1319414400,,683,4.666666666666667

It wasn't until after Id bought it that I discovered its dubious origins. Reading the numerous reviews from other buyers I learned that the set came with defectively manufactured discs, but I was hoping to be one of the lucky ones. Well, no such luck. The first disc I chose to view was NOTORIOUS, and it froze up around halfway through, never to unfreeze again. The second disc I checked out was YOUNG AND INNOCENT, and the same thing applied, freeze-up halfway through, and that was all she wrote. In addition, there was indeed a network of cracks throughout one end of the clear plexiglass slipcover. I could've overlooked that, but not the defective discs, since watching the films is the essence of the product. There is a happy ending, I did find my missing copy of SABOTAGE, and it plays just fine. Let the buyer beware.",1313452800,5,1028,4.685082872928176

3527823,1,B001D8W7EA,"I considered the 1-star rating for quite a while before posting.  I feel I need to add to the warning to any potential customer that they should avoid the frustration of purchasing a collection of lesser-known Hitchcock movies and being unable to actually enjoy the movies.  However, if you want to run the risk of getting defective disks (20th Century Fox has dropped production of this package), you may get lucky and have no problems.

These disks are obviously low-quality burns of the remastered transfers.  The movies all experience problems of halting at about 2/3 of the way through the movie.  In the case of 'Young and Innocent' and 'Rebecca' two whole chapters cannot be accessed, even by direct selection, fast forward or rewind to get at the scenes.  This is with multiple DVD and Blu-Ray players, so it is not an equipment problem.  I think the packaging is not the cause since DVDs are not so fragile that minor friction caused by removing the disk once would cause scratches, and the surface of the disks is pristine.  The movies have been digitally remastered and look very good while they play, but when it encounters these problems, the DVD vibrates the whole player and the movie skips and then eventually halts.

When I encountered the problem with 'Young and Innocent', I called 20th Century Fox customer service and the representative quickly offered to send a replacement, but I expect I will need to do it with each disk.  He claimed that the packaging selection was an attempt to be 'green'; there's no way this package saves the environment.  Glossy printed pages in a metal spiral notebook with pressed cardboard cover, all surrounded by a thick plastic case, unique packaging requiring a setup of special production lines.  How many of us gaze with admiration at the packaging in priority to the actual quality of the disks and the provision of proper protection?  When will companies stop being 'innovative' with packaging and save the development money for quality DVD imaging?

UPDATE:

I have to say that the 20th Century Fox Customer Service has been gracious when I have called them and has offered a replacement that is supposed to take care of the problem.  I have to send my set back to get a replacement, which I prefer over returning to Amazon because a replacement from Amazon may be from the defective batch.  I do call upon 20th Century Fox to at least pull the supply from Amazon so anyone ordering from this very popular online provider gets a 'good' set.

UPDATE 2:

20th Century Fox Customer Service has worked with me over the past few months to correct all of the defective disks.  I was told that they are NOT producing a corrected version, so whatever is out there in stock is the same, potentially defective version.  They actually took the time to check the disks before sending a replacement set to me less 'Notorious', which even in the replacement set was defective.  They sent that movie to me individually to complete the set.  Now that I've watched the entire set, I would rate the content 5 stars - they definitely put a lot of work into the package.  Unfortunately, their quality control was lacking on the mass production (DVD burning), which caused many customers to receive unplayable movies.  Very high marks to 20th Century Fox Customer Service in their work with me to correct the problem, but I can't predict that everyone would be willing to go through the effort to fix the defective disks.",1302048000,8,3460,4.7747899159663865

3527826,4,B001D8W7EA,"I own 2 other Hitchcock collections sold by Amazon, and was happy to add this one as well. ""Rebecca"" represents the only Hitch film ever to win the Best Picture Oscar, and is worth owning for excellent performances from Laurence Olivier & Joan Fontaine. ""Spellbound"" has a terrific turn by Gregory Peck as an amnesiac with Ingrid Bergman as the phychiatrist who falls for him. One of my favourite Peck films. Another excellent performance by Bergman in ""Notorious"" with Cary Grant playing against type (and extremely well, I may add!). These and many others make this set a worthy addition to your collection, even if you are not a Hitchcock fan.
One note: the initial set I received had some defective discs which made some movies impossible to watch in their entirety (hence the 4-star rating for this product).

One other option: All the DVDs in the set are available for individual purchase in traditional spindle DVD cases (Actually Lifeboat is not available individually as a ""Premier Collection"" release but is available as a ""Special Edition"" release). I bought one just to see if it was an improvement over the box set release. I am happy to report that the disc from the individual set is clean and plays fine.

I already owned 2 Hitchcock box sets: The Signature Collection and Hitchcock 14-Disc Box Set. However there were several important films missing like Rebecca, Notorious, Spellbound. After searching Amazon for these films, I found this collection. It arrived yesterday and I am absolutely happy with it.

I was a bit afraid of what I would find, after reading the negative reviews about the quality of the product, especially due to the fact that I'm in Portugal and a replacement would cost money and time. But I was lucky. I spent some hours checking every disk and they all played well. Some of the discs do vibrate when loading, but then the noise stops and there's no other problem.

*Notorious* was the disc people most complained about in the reviews. I noticed some discoloration on its surface, but I watched the entire film with no problem at all.

The discs come in a spiral book inserted in a protective plastic box. This book has lots of written information about each film. Each individual disc comes also loaded with very interesting bonus features. I am really enjoying this box set.

The only negative thing I have to say has to do with the packaging. The box set came inside an envelope, not in a box. This was not adequate protection for the plastic case, which was broken upon arrival. It's a pity because I really liked the box.

I opened and visually inspected all the discs right away and quickly saw some possible issues.  One disc (Notorious) had obvious discoloration / cloudiness on the outer half of the disc, and several others either appeared scuffed or had some sort of tiny abrasions on them.  I popped the discs with more obvious problems into my computer and let AnyDVD scan them.  I was disappointed to see the scan fail with the message that the DVD is dirty or damaged.  I had this happen with another DVD (Lifeboat) at which point I stopped, requested a replacement through Amazon, and packaged everything back up.

Two days later I got the replacement set.  Sadly, things were a bit worse.  Now multiple discs had visible signs of discoloration and others had what I can only describe as micro-fractures - they look like small scratches but are not on the surface.

The idea of getting gorgeous new transfers (especially of early gems like The Lodger and Young And Innocent) absolutely thrilled me.

Once I got the set in hand, I continued to be excited. What gorgeous packaging! What a nice booklet! What a great presentation!

And then I began to put in the discs.

The Lodger didn't want to play in my standalone DVD player. It wouldn't even load. It just froze up the unit. I was forced to watch it on a video game console. Rebbecca was even worse. When presented with the disc my DVD player let loose with a horrible grinding sound as if the player was dying. The player WASN'T dying, of course, and continues to work fine with other DVDs. I put the disc in my video game console instead and got the same thing. An awful sound the likes of which I'd never heard it make before.

Other discs in this set gave me the same problems. Glitchy playback. Faulty loading. Some are completely unplayable.

What a tremendous disappointment.

Either be prepared to go through a returns process or three until you get a decent set, or skip this entirely. This set really ought to be recalled. Sadly, I suspect that won't happen.

3527847,3,B001D8W7EA,"I bought this set back in October and ran into the same quality problem so many others have experienced. However all eight discs played fine on my Toshiba HD-A35, albeit some were a bit noisy. (Rebecca being the worst) Since they did play, I did not return them fearing I would get a set that was worse. I recently set up my old Liteon region free player to take the workload off of the Toshiba, as the vast majority of my viewing is in SD. I have been watching the reviews here and decided to take another look at these discs on my Liteon player. The vibration was tremendous on Rebecca and it refused to play. Notorious was almost as bad as it would spin up freeze, spin down and back up again, freeze again, stop, start, etc. About 4 of the 8 discs have no problems; the others do with varying degrees. My curiosity was up, so I had to experiment. I was able to rip all eight to my hard drive with no problem. This is a good test of the data. I made a copy of the worst one, Rebecca, on a DVD+R DL disc and tried it out on the Liteon. It played perfectly, nice and quiet.  This tells me there is no problem with the data on the disc. I know some have commented on the funny look of some of the discs, and think that it is due to de-lamination from warpage, and therefore gives read errors. Mine also look like that but I have seen this on other discs of mine that were packaged properly in standard cased. They have never given me a problem.  The next step was to open up my Liteon and see just what was going on. I put Rebecca on the spindle with the magnetic clamp on top and slowly spun the disc. With an eye loupe I could see no indication of warpage, but did notice that the two layers of Polycarbonate that sandwich together to make the disc were not exactly lined up. There was a bit of adhesive on the edges also that was not consistent. I did the same inspection with the DVD-R DL that I made, and the difference was amazing.  The edge looked like a perfectly machined surface with the slightest hint of adhesive. The telltale test was actually starting up the disc to play. The vibration and out of round blur of the center of the spindle was tremendous. It was obvious that the disc was grossly out of balance. The disc has to spin faster when playing the beginning of the movie since that data is in the innermost part of the disc. DVDs play from the inside to the outside on the first layer, and from the outside back in for the second layer. The menus, studio logos, and FBI warnings are stored after the main movie, and end up about in the middle of the disc depending on move length.  When I play Rebecca on my Toshiba, the noise doesn't start until the main movie starts, and as the movie progresses, the disc spin slower and the vibration slowly dissipates. The menu, logo, and FBI warning play silently. If the problem was warpage as some have speculated, the movie should play better at the beginning, and slowly get worse as the laser travels farther out, where the warpage would increase at the edge of the disc. To prove my theory, I took a piece of an Avery label with a couple of layers of copper foil for weight and attached it to Rebecca's topside. After testing in several spots I found the right place and Rebecca played just fine, with no noise or vibration, on my Liteon player!  This is of course not a solution, but merely a demonstration of the actual problem with these discs. The discs are obviously defective. It is a sad state when I can go through hundreds of DVD+R's at about 25 cents each and never see a problem like this, and spend $10 or more, each, for a classic movie, and get the cheapest piece of junk, made by the lowest bidder that the studio could find.

P.S. Please don't lecture me on the legalities of the ripping and burning of this disc. As Doc Brown said in Back to the Future, ""It's a science experiment"". Besides I paid my money, and nowhere have I advocated or given instruction on how to circumvent any copy protection scheme.",1231200000,34,3990,4.2781456953642385
3527848,3,B001D8W7EA,"What a shame that MGM spoiled such a beautiful collection of remastered and restored films -- replete with wonderful extras -- by lack of care.

Start with the packaging. While the box is interestingly - even cleverly -  designed, the plastic slipcase is prone to damage and cracking. I received one with an entire corner missing, making the jagged edges truly Hitchcockian in their inherent danger. I don't mind, as others seem to, the cardboard slipsleeves that hold the discs. Not the best, maybe, but also not serious enough for all the hysteria. Slip the disc in lightly, just enough to hold it in place, and all is well.

Strangely, considering all the interesting tidbits included about each film in the 'notebook', none of the actual film credits (cast, duration, etc.) appear anywhere. This basic information can only be found on the removable sheet which surrounds the plastic slipcase. What are they smoking at MGM?

I, too, have had disc problems on two sets. They may freeze, jump to another chapter, cause player to make noise, or have difficulty loading in.  As I have four different players, I was able to find one to overcome these errors. But this is a serious problem for anyone with a single player. What is surprising is that the price remains so high, even on used sets.

Although seems almost incidental with all the problems, the film transfers are uniformly beautiful and the commentaries are informative, entertaining, and apt.  The Lodger is probably the most beautiful silent film issued on DVD, with full orchestral score and near-pristine transfer.  Amazing.  Perhaps that is why I, and others, keep trying to get a perfect set. I second the motion that MGM re-issue a clean set, make amends to previous purchasers, and restore the reputation that these films - and the care which went into their restoration - warrant.",1230681600,8,1849,4.9006410256410255

Fortunately, none of the discs in my box set are defective (as some Amazon reviewers have complained). They do make a bit of noise in the DVD player, which can be somewhat distracting, but otherwise the movies play just fine. The other issue I have is with the packaging. Sure, it's a very nice set with a beautiful book but the discs are kept in cardboard sleeves which can potentially damage the DVD's (I suggest buying some cheap jewel cases to house the discs). Otherwise, I am happy with the set.

That being said, the transfers are exceptional and most of the special features are interesting and well-produced. I would have liked it if MGM had included more excerpts from the Hitchcock/Bogdanovich and Hitchcock/Truffaut interviews, but the included material is still topical and are likewise welcome additions.

Of course, that's not to mention the real star of the box set-the film's themselves. While I think the set is missing a few movies from this era of Hitchcock's career (1930's-1940's), it still includes some remarkable peices of work. My favorites included are Rebecca, Spellbound, Sabotage, Notorious and The Paradine Case.

Overall, you may want to wait and see if MGM recalls the package for the technical issues. However, I've had no issues with my set and have enjoyed watching and re-watching the movies.",1228003200,2,1347,4.946902654867257

I agree with everyone else that ALL dvds need to be secured on studs or pegs -- NO MORE SLEEVES!  This automatically damages the discs, and I don't know why some studios continue to release their product like this.  Fortunately, none of my discs were damaged, but every time you remove and replace the discs in their original sleeves, you may run the risk of scuffing or scratching them.

I removed each disc VERY carefully and don't plan to put them back in the album.  I'll store them in plastic sleeves for safekeeping.

I run the Alfred Hitchcock Wiki site and I've received dozens of emails and messages from people who've bought the set and are unable to play one or more of the discs.  Clearly whoever handled the physical manufacturing of the DVDs has foobar'd big time.

3527861,5,B001D8W7EA,"I've been reading about all the technical problems people have been posting. I got lucky and have had no problems at all yet. I've played 4 all the way through with no problems (Notorious, Lifeboat, Rebecca, and Spellbound), and quickly tested the others and no problems so far. (Toshiba HD-A20 player).

I'm very impressed with the picture quality on these 1920s to 40s movies. They've done a good job with restoration.

Lots of great features too. Each movie has a lengthy ""making of"" feature and other long features, plus interviews with Hitchcock and many other things. I wonder if they are using a newer type of compression to accomodate all these things, and that may account for a lot of the technical problems people are having  -- maybe older machines and some newer ones don't work well with this type of compression. Just speculating. It could be that it was just a particular batch that went bad. So some sets are good and some defective.

The main thing I don't like is the packaging -- it's just not very practical:

* The movies are each inserted into 8 different cardboard pages in a thick looseleaf booklet, with regular paper pages interspersed between. To get the movie you want you have to flip through the looseleaf book until you find it. There are no tabs, so until you memorize where in the book they all are, you have to do some searching.

* The cardboard pages that the movies slide into don't clearly label the name of the movie. You can see the top of half of the discs, but the titles are on the lower half of the discs, hidden in the slot, so you can't use the disc to identify the movie. You have to look in the small type amongst the credits typed onto the slot, to see the name of the movie, or else flip back to the beginning of the pages relating to the movie - it's labeled there. I'm tempted to write in the name of the movie in big letters at the top of the pages of the inserts, but that's bad news for later if one wants to sell it.

* There are at least 6 pages of info for each movie, but a lot of that is wasted space. There is no page detailing the cast for each movie. The best you get is the top 2 or 3 stars printed on the slot for the movie. You have to go to the credits of the movie itself to see who plays what. This is very inconvenient if you suddenly see an actor you want to identify. Fortunately I have IMDB handy for that on the web. I may copy out the cast for each of these movies from that and word process them all onto a single paper and stick that in the set. But it seems like MGM should have done that task for us. Among the 6 pages for each movie is one page that is just a few quotes from the movie and a few pictures. It would have been better to put the cast in those pages instead.

One might be better off buying each movie separately, but they are not all available that way, with all these special features. I'm convinced that the PQ and the substance of the movies are good enough that I am going to give the set a 5 and overlook the inconvenience of the packaging.",1224979200,7,3040,4.193493150684931

Of course, as soon as they arrived, I checked all 8 discs in my player and I encountered none of the problems reported.  Perhaps I got a second pressing or it's a specific batch that was problematic.

The packaging is to say the least original.  It looks as if someone was aiming at ""Most special packaging of the year award"".  Without much thought to practicality.  I don't think all these refinements were necessary since all the printed text could have fitted in a nice fat booklet without producing this cumbersome set (and such a wasteful use of plastic!).  As for the discs being vulnerable to scratches because they are between cardboard, this danger may be exaggerated.  I have seen similar cardboard sleeves used in some classical music editions where CDs are included with books, and I never scratched any of them.  As long as you don't get crumbs in the sleeves or rub the disc against the metal spiral!

The content is unbeatable.  As I was testing the discs, I sampled the commentaries and documentaries; the amount of bonus material offered is almost overwhelming, especially since it appears to be consistently of very high quality.  At a tad over 8$ per film, this is remarkable value, especially considering that the 3 titles issued individually so far are sold at 15$.  And this depite the fact that not all of these titles are necessarily top-tier Hitchcock, The Paradine Case being a prime example and Spellbound amounting to an ill-fitting assemblage of psychoanalytical claptrap.  But we do get Notorious, one of the most perfect of Hitch's filmic achievements, with 2 commentaries different from those on the out-of-print Criterion edition.  And the three titles from his British period will probably be a discovery for many, especially in these nicely restored versions.

Well, I thought I had dodged a bullet.  I got through the first five discs with no perceptible problems.

About an hour into the film the most unbearable stops, starts, pixels, lack of sound all started destroying the movie!

Right when Dev and Alicia get out of the wine cellar and are in the garden devising a way to get out of the situation, the picture becomes distorted.  After a while it returns to normal, only to start up again!  Whole scenes are skipped until the final scene.

The disc is defective and Rebecca looks as though it is too : ((.

A replacement should already be on the way (thank you Amazon!), but I warn you to check the discs carefully right away.

The packing is quite different from the normal box sets with the DVDs cased in a spiral bound Photo Album type hard cover book with picture of Hitchcock on it. The outer case is made of thick transparent plastic with very nice art work on it. The outer case looks very heavy and good quality plastic. It is designed in a way that the art work on the album cover is visible through the transparent case.

All the DVDs are placed inside the book. Each movie includes 6 pages of printed materiel followed by a page with the DVD tucked in. It is a really awesome pack to have. The only concern is that the dimensions of the box is bigger then the standard DVD case and it won't fit in my DVD rack and I have to store it separately. Also removing and placing the DVDs back into their 'slots' is not so friendly compared to the regular DVD cases.

The transfer is really amazing. I think the picture quality of Rebecca, Notorious and Spellbound DVDs are better then or equal to the previous Criterion Collection editions. I am very much satisfied with the quality of other movies also, considering the period they were made. 'The Lodger' has mostly a blue or red tint on it but the picture is very sharp. I have not seen any other editions of this movie hence cannot compare.

When I saw also the list including the special features then I got really amazed by it. I have seen all the movies included in this box set and overall 50 movies out of Hitch's entire filmography. I must say that I also have some British and European editions for Lifeboat, Young and Innocent & The Lodger. The first movie is an Italian edition which is quite good almost like the US Edition, the second and the third are British Editions which are much more than silly in terms of image quality and sound.

My first thought is that this collection is a treasure for every Hitchcock lover. And believe me, he invented thriller and film noir, of course being influenced by German Expresionism (Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, etc). A shame for all the members of the Oscar Academy that did not give him credit as he deserved (the same they did for Orson Welles). To conclude this is a must have, don't miss it!!!

Update 28/02/2009
I became more than disappointed by the disc's quality when I have started to watch them. Until now I can say for sure that Young and Innocent, Paradine Case and Notorious are defective. Notorious is the worst of all: ALMOST 11 MINUTES OF THE FILM ARE MISSING. I know it is late but I will write to Amazon and let them know about this and then I will ask for a replacement (even if I purchased this item in October 2008)!!! Too bad, it's a shame that MGM masacred what was supposed to be one of the best items issued yet!!!!",1223424000,5,1637,4.3431372549019605
3527875,2,B001D8W7EA,"The quality of Hitchcock's movies is, I think, no longer in dispute.  These are some of his best, and they're worth owning without question.  This review will focus completely on the 8-disc set itself, the transfers, and the packaging.

I'll start with the packaging: it sucks.  Big time.  How manufacturers continue to produce these expensive sets and package the DVDs in cardboard sleeves is BEYOND me.  I opened the set, saw the cardboard sleeves, and quickly removed the discs from the sleeves and put them in a slim case for shelving.  As careful as I was... and I was VERY careful... I still ended up scratching the discs a little.  I popped the discs in to check to see if, slight as the scratches were,  they affected playback... and they seem to play fine.  Still, I have a set that's 2 hours in my possession, and the discs are scuffed... and that bothers me.

They made an effort at cool packaging which caused this... the discs come in a very cool spiral-bound book that has a few pages on each movie, and then you flip to where the disc sets.  I admire the design, I even like the book, but it would have been better served if the movies were OUTSIDE it.  In cases, maybe?  Anyway.

The transfers seem very, very good.  Given a lot of these movies are probably from significantly degraded transfers, I have to applaud the restoration efforts.  I've watched The Paradine Case and am now watching Young and Innocent... Paradine was practically spotless, Young and Innocent looks the same.  Audio is crisp, noise and film scratches are gone.  I'm impressed... this set will make a dandy replacement for the Criterion set featuring Notorious, Spellbound and Rebecca, assuming the same standards hold throughout the set.

All in all, I'd have still bought the set, it's the only way to get a lot of these movies, and the quality is good.  I really wish I'd been in the marketing meeting when they decided on the blasted cardboard sleeves, but what can ya do, ya know?",1219276800,68,1975,4.63400576368876

8292411,1,B001D8W7EA,"Got this set today and so far Notorious and Rebecca are both significantly unplayable. Discs stutter and freeze halfway through each film. Which is just mean, honestly, being suspense films and all. Have requested either working copies or a full refund - will update with seller's response.  Also, the outer plastic casing was cracked in half. I keep dvds in a separate case so that doesn't bother me much but it might irritate anyone who wants to display the collection.",1489104000,3,471,4.8875
8292412,1,B001D8W7EA,"Fantastic movie! The movie itself: 5/5 stars. But I watched the Amazon instant version, which had a TERRIBLE quality in video. I feel sorry for the poor chap who purchased this version. The resolution is less than 480p, it looks around 200-300p. There is a WATERMARK that appears in and out of the film. It was obvious this was recorded on a television. The audio quality is also horrendous. Needs to me remastered. I had to use subtitles. I watched this using Amazon Prime and they showed a commercial before the film. So many horrible instances and I'm disappointed Amazon Prime would present such a great film in awful quality.",1485216000,,630,4.736363636363636

8292416,3,B001D8W7EA,"It's a Hitchcock film, so it automatically gets rated above 'fair' in my opinion. Compared to his other/later movies, thought: this is average...which is to say: better than 90% of the movies made these days. Still, judging it against its peers (other Hitchcock films), I can only give it 3 stars. Part of the problem is that, as is common with a lot of the older Hitchcock films, the sound isn't very good. It helps to play it with subtitles enabled.",1479168000,,451,4.580246913580247
