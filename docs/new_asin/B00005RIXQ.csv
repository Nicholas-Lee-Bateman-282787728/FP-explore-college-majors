1655579,2,B00005RIXQ,Very disappointing production. The singing was OK but the staging and acting very less successful than other productions of Aida that I have seen,1109894400,,145,5.083333333333333
1655580,4,B00005RIXQ,Productions in Verona are designed to appeal to the thousands of viewers seated far from the stage. Performing in this ampitheatre is basically like performing in a stadium so that does affect the performance. Fortunately Verona attracts some of the great Italian artists who may not have become familiar (or overly so) to American opera fans. I was fortunate enough to hear Martinucci sing Cavaradossi in Naples in 1981. The voice was everything one could hope for as it is here in this performance of Aida. I have no problem with a tenor who settles for producing the best high notes of the 80s. He sings Celeste Aida with absolute ease.  Cossotto delivers a classic big Italian performance that fills the stage and Chiara is a distinguished Aida.,1264982400,2,749,4.8515625
1655581,1,B00005RIXQ,"The reason anybody would be interested in this DVD is its historical value. The singers are classic. The particular stage production is of interest. The actual performance is very good.

On the other hand, I find the video very difficult to watch. The cameras that are close to the stage are set below stage level so that no character can be filmed full-view. Everybody is  cut off at the knees.

The choices of shots is wrong 33% of the time. The camera often zooms in on Aida while Amneris is delivering lines. The wrong actor is often featured on screen.

Closeups are infrequent; so actual acting is usually left out. There are too many wide angle shots in which the beautiful massive stage is featured while it is difficult to tell if there is anything actually going on on that stage or if there is even anybody standing on it.

All the wide shots are made with the actors' legs chopped off at the thighs while the space above the actors' heads takes up most of the screen.

Watching the video is an aggravating experience. I tried to just listen and not watch and that experience is inferior to just listening to the opera on one of my CDs. The outdoor wind is evident and the thin and simple 2-channel stereo is not rewarding.

I bought this DVD on the strength of the four 5-star reviews on the product. I am very disappointed in the purchase. I'm thinking of returning it even though I'll only get a 50% refund.

Unless you are interested in the historic performance value you will not appreciate the production.",1208563200,16,1522,4.529197080291971
1655582,4,B00005RIXQ,"Other reviewers have been very favorable about this performance but I found it disappointing.  Granted the spectacular staging is hard to beat but I felt that the conductor didn't quite hold his forces together.  Its not easy to do when everything is so spread out.  There are many places where the rhythms are shaky.  Chiara is good, as she is on the DVD conducted by Maazel.  I like the Rhadames but he is not really heroic in either build or voice.  Here Pavarotti is superior even if he doesn't look like a warrior.  With his sheer size he is heroic and the voice is without peer.  The big let down for me is Cossoto.  She is a handsome woman with an attractive mezzo which has never spread into a wobble during her long career.  But everything she does is so one dimensional.  By contrast, Dimitrova on the Maazel set gives a performance full of nuances.  Some have noted that she was miscast as Amneris but I don't see why.  Being heavy and middle aged gives her more reason to  be frustrated in her rivalry with Aida for Rhadames'affection.
Maazel gives a tighter performance than the Arena conductor.  I concede this without really being a fan of Maazel in general.

Some mention should be made of the recently released performance directed by Zeffirelli in the Busoto theater using young unknown singers.  In sharp contrast to the Verona performance the stage is extremely small but beautifully set. One lovely touch is to see the temple dancers looking very much like figures in Egyptian wall paintings.  The singing, as one might expect from the largely unknown cast, is somewhat uneven.  But there is enough fine singing to make the set a worthy addition to any library as a second Aida.",1206921600,3,1699,4.65993265993266
1655583,5,B00005RIXQ,"I am new to this Aida and its magic spell is now upon me. Of course any Aida will rise and fall on the title role and this is a superior Aida on all counts not least vocally and interpretatively.  Some will argue that Leontyne Price is the Aida of our times.  I disagree since Price, to these ears, is a singer of the stand and deliver variety. What Cheryl Studer accomplishes in the title role is an unexpected pleasure. Listen to her ""O patria mia"" to understand what I mean. I could go on and on. For example, d'Intino is also a superb Amneris. Less so is O'Neill as Radames but you can't have it all. Bravi!",1190160000,4,611,4.169491525423729
1655584,5,B00005RIXQ,"This production is staged in the Roman theater at Verona.  This huge ""stage"" allows an impressive, almost overwhelming, triumphal march with scads of priests, slaves, warriors, etc. The only qualification is the ballet that accompanies the march.  The dancers dance well but en pointe which seems a bit out of place considering that the sets and costumes are all thoroughly ancient Egyptian.  (It's almost as if one were watching Anna Pavlova Cleopatra -- a curious mix.  But that's just minor carping on my part).  The singers give us a robust performance -- Chiara and Cossotto (yes, she's a bit chunky and elderly) are superb.  Martinucci has a stentorian voice but a bit monochromatic; on balance, though a strong performance.  The Ramfis is weak; otherwise, the rest of the cast is more than competent.  But for me the real star of the show is the setting -- much more expansive than the typical opera stage which is precisely what Aida needs during its moments of spectacle.",1171843200,9,980,4.8969696969696965
1655585,5,B00005RIXQ,I never thought that Cheryl Studer could pull off Aida. But she does. She sings with her usual committment vocally and the audience love her. The staging is impressive and the chorus and orchestra under Edward Downes add to the production. The remainder of the cast perform excellently.,1160265600,5,286,4.979166666666667
1655586,5,B00005RIXQ,"This was recorded in 1981.
The sound quality is very good, and the picture quality is fair enough.

Both Chiara and Cossotto were already very famous at this stage.
The two of them knew how to behave in front of an enthusiastic audience, especially Cossotto, whose diva-like manners are typical.
Nevertheless, you can't expect better portrayals of the ethiopian princess and her egyptian rival.

Martinucci is far more modest. It looks like he was embarrassed from the amount of clapping after his aria.
He deserved no less!
His singing and acting are such to be put rightly in the same line as the female singers above.

The rest of the cast is good, the orchestra gives a colourful support and the ballet is lovely.

In conclusion, an almost perfect production.",1147392000,19,763,4.846153846153846
1655587,5,B00005RIXQ,"There are several AIDA performances now available on DVD.I would rate this as one of the best. For a Live performance at the Arena di Verona, it has been well shot and well recorded. Though all singers and conductor acquit themselves with merit, the show belongs to Chiara and Cossoto. Though fairly limited in the acting department, Chiara who began as a glorious lyric soprano had, by this time developed into a fine dramatic voice. Her 'Ritorna Vincitor!','O patria mia' and the entire Nile Scene is stunning..as can be judged from the well deserved applause she receives after each of Aida's great pieces.(Chiara's later DVD Aida with Pavarotti pales in comparison)Cossotto, though terribly overweight at this point, sings as none of her contemporaries could. Martinucci, the Rhadames is competant without being the Star- his lady companions take care of that. All in all, a DVD to return to over and over again-as I've done from the earlier issued VHS to the newly released DVD.",1123200000,39,983,5.0
1655588,5,B00005RIXQ,"This consistently intense performance has very good sound presence. The video is sufficiently detailed BW.

The profound understanding of this work by maestro Toscanini is hair rising and just invites repeated playing to discover hidden nuances or interpretative geniality.

Unique document even though I like the old 2 laserdisks only because it contains the reactions of all  the artists AFTER the final applauses ... and initial entrances. But the convenience of having the entire work on a single DVD (instead of 2 laserdisks) is a most welcome convenience!

Notice that this is a PAL format (Europe) and not NTSC (USA)

Luckily my DVD played accepts this format!! Lucky me!!",1120435200,13,679,5.192660550458716
1655589,1,B00005RIXQ,"Singing isn't all that great, but it was probably the best part of this production. The conducting was bad, the acting was bad, the staging was bad...I think you get the clue. I couldn't watch it all in one sitting. I had to stop after the first act and watch the rest later. Poor Verdi, he'd be rolling in his grave if he knew these terrible musicians had ruined his art!",1119225600,2,372,4.253521126760563

I must state categorically that this review is for the Arena di Verona performance of 1981 and NOT the Covent Garden Aida. Amazon confuses the two and the reviews appear haphazardly, mostly for the wrong performances.

This Aida is from an open air performance at the Arena di Verona, an ancient Roman amphitheatre left in a good state of preservation and has magnificent, natural acoustics. It's a live event with thousands of people attending and there is a great sense of occasion. The stage is huge and very wide and the designer created a wonderful set of a pyramid with stone steps to the top and a tunnel like entry into the innards of the pyramid, like an entry to the temple. The overall setting is versatile, sometimes monumental and sometimes intimate as governed by superb lighting effects. THE TRIUPMHAL SCENE IS THERE TO BE WITNESSED WITH GOLD AND WHITE RADIANCE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I could go on describing the effects, but you should really see it and this video would give you a fair idea.

The performance itself is also one of the best in terms of voices, the orchestra and chorus. Maria Chiara, a world famous Aida sings superbly, looks and acts the part, a true star of the show. Radames, Nicola Martinucci is a powerful, sensitive tenor, worthy partner of Miss Chiara. Fiorenza Cossotto comes to her forte in the 4th act musically and dramatically and Giuseppe Scandola is truly frightening and elemental as a tiger, one of the most powerful Amonasro-s I've ever seen. Conducting of Anton Guadagno, who conducts without a score is perfect for the grand occasion. He is energetic, with upbeat tempi and an uncanny control of the vast forces in his disposal.
I don't like to refer to other sources, but in this case I'd like to advise you that the Penguin Record Guide, the most highly respected guide to classical recordings gives this set a 'rosette' which is above 4 stars and only given to the very best. Think about this if you please when you read some negative reviews.

7952383,5,B00005RIXQ,"[NOTE: The review below applies to and was posted *only* to the page for a DVD of a 1981 ADA starring Maria Chiara, Fiorenza Cossotto, and Nicola Martinucci. It should not appear on any other Amazon page for a DVD with different singers, as it presently does.]

I was in no hurry to see this ADA, although I knew it had admirers. It is on that no-frills cheapie label Kultur, so I did not expect it to look or sound very good, even for a 30+-year-old video. The conductor was unknown to me, and the only cast member I knew well was Fiorenza Cossotto, whose Amneris I already had on numerous CD and DVD recordings; and by the date of 1981, I expected the great mezzo to be, if not ready for pasture, past her best. It seemed a superfluous addition.

I eventually did see it, and I was pleased to be proved so wrong. There is no better performance of ADA on video than this one from the Arena di Verona. One may prefer one/both of two classic performances from the 1960s (Tucci/Simionato/Del Monaco and Gencer/Cossotto/Bergonzi, the latter also from Arena di Verona), but these black-and-white films are technically primitive to such a degree that they are best recommended to hardcore buffs. Certainly, a number of later videos, including two each from La Scala and the Met, offer improvements on the picture and sound of the '81 Verona -- but not on the artistic levels. This one, it seems to me, achieves the best balance: more than tolerable technically, and a lusty all-Italian performance of a type that has nearly vanished.

Maria Chiara had a successful career without ever quite breaking into the front rank. The Met heard her in a single role, Violetta, in a handful of performances in 1977. On the evidence here, one wonders why. Hers is not the biggest or most beautiful voice ever to essay the title role, but it is full of haunting colors and overtones. Over and above that, there is an honesty about her, a complete trust in Verdi's music. She has that special way of pulling you into the dilemma of a character even when you know what is going to happen and know every word along the way. When I was initially spot-checking this video, before I had time to watch it complete, I kept planning only to sample bits, but she would have me sitting rapt for whole scenes. There is nothing false, cheap or excessive about her performance -- she is a musician who idiomatically and artistically shapes the vocal lines and tellingly enunciates the words that make up the text. The sum is a strong statement on the character, one that respects the classic models but is personal and individual to her. This all sounds so basic, so why does it so rarely happen? Chiara is also a sincere actress and a lithe physical performer, and her wig and darkening makeup are among the least risible in the video catalog.

Nicola Martinucci presents a physically virile and vocally dashing Radams. Other video versions have more famous names in the part (including two of the famous Three Tenors), but not better musical showings. Martinucci does not give the impression either of cautiously saving and feeling his way through or of burning capital. The volume and tessitura of this taxing part seem easily within his reach. He makes much of his words. Another reviewer commented on his ""rolling consonants like dice"" in his Act I aria, and I cannot improve on that description (this whole cast gives a lesson on the gains native speakers bring to a Verdi opera). He also has a noble bearing and wears his costumes well.

Fiorenza Cossotto was a durable and reliable performer over a long career, but beginning in the later 1970s, she was showing an increasing tendency to flat on top, and the tone throughout her range had grown harder, less alluring than in her best years. But here, she is a pleasant surprise, in best later-career form. Only some climactic highs in the noisy conclusion of the Triumphal Scene come in under the mark. If a connoisseur may prefer one of her earlier Amnerises on DVD, the '66 Verona or the '73 Tokyo (with Santunione and, again, Bergonzi), this does not diminish the impact of the '81 performance in isolation. The threats to her romantic rival, the cursing of the priests, have lost none of their cataclysmic force, but she can also be honeyed and plaintive. She is a less modern and subtle actor than Chiara, but it is an interpretation well worked out over decades, delivered with panache and powerful self-confidence in her means. (All three leads do break character, in the bad old style, to acknowledge ovations.)

No one else in the cast does anything distinctive enough to steal the spotlight from that lead trio, but they all discharge their responsibilities. Giuseppe Scandola, getting the worst of the costuming, is a respectable Amonasro in the ""bullying brute"" mold. Of the two basses, Alfredo Zanazzo's King of Egypt has cleaner attacks than Carlo Zardo's slightly viscous and woofy Ramfis. Conductor Anton Guadagno paces an exciting show.

The challenges of stage-directing, sound-recording, and filming in this enormous venue (a stage 30 meters wide, a seating capacity around 15,000) are gamely confronted but not entirely overcome. The end of Act III is almost comical: the roly-poly Amonasro ""charges"" Amneris, dagger in hand, but moves at such a leisurely trot and has so much ground to cover that Amneris seems in little danger even without Radams's intercession. The orchestra sounds punchy and incisive, but the recording of it is distant; inner detail and delicacies of texture are not ideally clear. The frequent wide spacing of the principals forces video director Brian Large into doing what he is sometimes criticized for doing when he works from ""normal"" theaters: tight one-shots that give little sense of the big stage picture. The Act I terzetto has Amneris high above Radams and Ada, who themselves are widely separated below, in a literal triangle, so Large can only give us this one, then that one, then the other one. For compensation, he alternates with distant shots from the rear of the arena and from above the stage, conveying something of the beauty and grandeur of the space in what surely was a great operatic evening.

English subtitling is occasionally tardy (a translation will appear just when you are on the verge of giving up) and lazier than it should be. The chorus's interjections are sometimes untranslated, and there is no excuse for failing to give us the words of Amneris's prayer during ""O terra addio"" -- including the last words of the opera!

The Met's first DVD, from 1989 (Millo, Zajick, Domingo, Milnes; cond. Levine), has more polished orchestral playing and is better recorded and filmed (video direction again by Brian Large). But Millo has far less to say about the eponymous heroine than does Chiara; Domingo sounds cautious and is in tired voice (it was close to time for him to set this role aside), and Milnes was far into a vocal decline. Even so, that is the only post-1981 DVD of ADA I can recommend as a second-place alternative to the Kultur DVD of the present review, which is a dim little triumph.",1375574400,5,7102,4.776872964169381

7952385,1,B00005RIXQ,"I bought this Aida because of Cheryl Studer.  She did not disappoint.  Luciana d'Intino as Amneris lent credibility.  The rest stunk.  I expected more from the Royal Opera House.  I cannot imagine worse staging:  meaning-less background screens, and poles with silly emblems.  Radames had black hair.  After he was sentenced to death, his hair turned completely white.  Edward Downes' pace was uncoordinated with either the chorus or the singers at spots.  The worse part was the intended triumphant scene.  It was Eurotrash, with top-less acrobats jumping around.  Verdi would turn over in his grave.  As a final insult, Kultur managed to mis-spell Cheryl Studers' name.

The Aida to buy is the one by Kate Aldrich, Adina Aaron, and Scott Piper.  It is beautifully done, guided by masterful mentors, Franco Zeffirelli and Carlo Bergonzi.",1325116800,2,838,5.195488721804511
