Similar videos are quite short, the videos in this series are a couple of hours and done very well",1317513600,,137,4.75
8013993,5,B0001LASFK,We bought this for my father in law for Christmas and he loved it! I haven't seen it but he raves over it and the places he wants to go dive now due to the video!,1297468800,,162,3.5277777777777777
8013994,4,B0001LASFK,"Scubacore Issue 1 is a great video for scuba divers and those considering taking the plunge.  Four different dive destinations are visited, each with their own distinct personalities and diving styles.  Travel from British Virgin Islands on the Cuan Law liveaboard to the Socorro Islands on the Solmar V.  Next the crew visits Yap and dives with mantas and visits the cultural centers for topside enjoyment.  Lastly, the group boards the Wind Dancer for another liveaboard vacation to Tobago.  At each destination, Anat Grant, your host, gives detailed tours of the boats and underwater life.  Sometimes humorous, sometimes serious, but always entertaining, the dialogs and dives are all spectacular.
This is the first of a group of 3 videos done by ScubaCore. Issues 2 and 3 are much better than this one as one would expect, but this one is still a MUST HAVE for any scuba diver.",1205366400,,881,4.918918918918919
8013995,5,B0001LASFK,"I bought ScubaCore Issue 1 because I wanted to check out the segment on Yap, and before I knew it two hours had done by and I had watched the entire DVD, special features and all.  The next day I bought ScubaCore Issues 2 and 3, and enjoyed them just as much.  The locations they show are really diverse, and having been to a few of those places, I can say that they are well-represented on the ScubaCore DVDs.  The quality of the underwater cinematography is fantastic -- this is some of the most colorful underwater footage I have seen.  Be sure to check out the special feature on sharks in Issue 3 -- it's obvious that these folks really care about the marine environment.  I highly recommend these beautiful DVDs for divers and anyone who is interested in learning more about our oceans.",1196812800,,792,4.472222222222222
8013996,4,B0001LASFK,"I really enjoyed watching the underwater footage, and the host isn't bad either. THe shows gave my wife and I the inspiration to visit the mantas of Socorro this year, so we're saving our pennies! It was like getting 4 half hour TV programs, a la Travel Channell, but definitely geard towards divers, and the host is obviously a good diver, herunderwater footage is awesome. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a scuba diver, and for people who just love the ocean. Looking forward to issue 2! The production on this DVD is nice, it's professionally done and nicely packaged, the booklet is a mini magazine by itself, with info and stories by the publisher, the host and the marine naturalist person. My only complaint is that this show isn't on cable!
