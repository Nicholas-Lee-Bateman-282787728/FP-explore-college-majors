8711688,2,B00VXWKAHC,"Far too lacking for $30:

-Many moves done too fast with too many steps unguided/unexplained.

-No step-by-step/slow intro for each movement, just the whole movement at full speed w/ partial guidance.
(which often meant having to look at the TV to follow along, while trying to copy moves that required turning away?
Really guys? Really??)

-Several moves lack key breathing instructions

-Or stance/footwork instructions

-No complete flow of all moves together w/ voice-guided follow-along. (In this day and age, that got overlooked?? Again... Really??)

Without spending anything more on their production budget, they could've sold us a much better DVD.
Somewhat frustrated. Looking forward to version 2.0.",1520121600,2,709,5.579439252336448
