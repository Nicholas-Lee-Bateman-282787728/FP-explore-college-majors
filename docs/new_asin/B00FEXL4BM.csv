5985827,5,B00FEXL4BM,"The MDNA tour is Madonna's ninth concert tour that spanned most of 2012 and was named the best-selling tour of 2012. In terms of production, this show makes up for the weak Sticky & Sweet two year tour saga, but as a whole does not compare to some of Madonna's top tour moments.

The show is broken out into specific sections with specific themes. The first theme and the opening section of the show is extremely violent, detached, cold and raw. Madonna defies gravity by dancing and moving to choreography that her younger predecessors wouldn't have ever been able to get through at the rehearsal stage. Where this first section goes wrong for me is well, the music. On paper it looks good but it doesn't translate into an energetic experience.
Girl Gone Wild, Revolver, Bang, Papa Don't Preach - (less than one minute), Hung Up - (auto-tuned, slowed down version that allows for Madonna to Slack-line throughout the track) and I Don't Give A - Madonna comes to the end of her V-shaped catwalk and does her signature guitar (time for a break) part.
Though these are decent tracks on their own, as a whole, there are too many weak tracks in this first section that don't carry this section. The choreography, on the other hand, is so intense and so precise that the music almost takes a back-seat. If I were given an opportunity to direct a Madonna show where I could pick just about any track I wanted and directed it how I wanted, I would keep the music in mind as the TOP priority. Here's my version of a set-list to go along with the theme and choreography of this first section:
Girl Gone Wild
Causing A Commotion (new 2013 version)
Bang
Papa Don't Preach (longer)
Rescue Me
Beautiful Killer

The second section was a majorette theme and really should have been saved for the end of the show. Here she does a funky rendition of Express Yourself and then goes into the Blaze remix of Give Me All Your Luvin' and then swiftly leaves the stage while the dancers finish out this quick, intense, hi-NRG section. Pure perfection.

The next section is more guitars, the basque trio supporting her with basque renditions of some classics she hasn't performed in years and more.
Turn Up the Radio - (surprised she turned this one into a guitar performance)
Open Your Heart - (basque version)
Masterpiece
I understand why she picked the tracks she did for this section. Turn up was one of the stand outs from MDNA. Open Your Heart is one of her biggest hits and a fan favorite and hasn't been performed since the Blond Ambition Tour. Masterpiece is the theme song of the film she directed, W.E. I would have preferred a version of Open Your Heart that remained closer to the original. This one was just a little too ""Riverdance"" and bouncy for me and not as sleek as the original. Nonetheless I do like that she weaves these unique sounds into her productions and keeps things fresh.

Once the basque section is complete, and after the sexy Justify My Love interlude come to an end, we go into the best version of Vogue that Madonna has done in years. It takes us back to the days of ""Blond Ambition"" and Madonna gives us some serious attitude. There's only one problem...one major problem...the best song of the night gets shortened and we lose the third verse and chorus?!?! WHY? Just as an FYI, she kept the same treatment and length from the Super Bowl performance which was great for that short medley performance but should have been given a full treatment during the MDNA Tour. She then goes into one of my favorite tracks from 2008's Hard Candy album, Candy Shop. With that said, putting this song on the set-list was a glaring mistake and a song she should not have done on this tour. If I were her, I would have gone right into ""Get Together"" from Confessions after Vogue to keep the energy going. She then performs Human Nature almost identical to the version we were introduced to in 1994 and similar choreography to the video from 1995. This truly was the best version of Human Nature she has ever choreographed for live performance. This leads into a strip tease where she removes most of the clothes she started with in this section and the music also gets stripped to just a piano and her singing. She sings Like A Virgin and Love Spent and does it beautifully backed with classical arrangements from the W.E. soundtrack.

She goes into her standard political video interlude with Nobody Knows Me, a gem from the under-rated American Life album and then comes out on stage performing, I'm Addicted. This track should have gotten a significantly better treatment than it did and really could have been a stand-out but it missed the mark. The song ends with the letters ""M"" ""D"" ""N"" ""A"" being chanted over and over. Im thinking epic performance possibility here. She then goes into ""I'm A Sinner/Cyberagga"" and she may have fared better if she instead had gone into ""Beautiful Stranger"" or ""Amazing"" or one of the older more popular tracks that ""Sinner"" was modeled after.

She goes into ""Like A Prayer"" which gets the entire house energized and reminds us of her legacy and the legend that she is and then closes the show with her not-so-popular compilation title track, ""Celebration."" I think she should have considered swapping the order, Celebration first then closing with Like A Prayer. That would have made for a stronger close.

Overall, this show is better than just about any show you will see from any other artist. The only artist that has put on a show better than this is, well....Madonna. Watch the Confessions Tour, Reinvention Tour and the iconic, Blond Ambition tour to see some more examples of her genius.

In terms of this blu-ray release, all the issues of the first release have been corrected! The style of the shoot itself remains the same though and is somewhat difficult to watch. Madonna is over-exposed throughout the entire performance and after being at this show live, I am somewhat surprised at some of the angles chosen during some of the intricate choreography on this recording. Finally, when will Madonna start adding the backing videos as extras? It is a pure travesty that those are left off as more often than not, those concert back-drops are better videos than some of her music video releases these days.",1383350400,10,6255,4.6645512239347235

5985870,1,B00FEXL4BM,"I echo what pretty much everyone has said:
1. Video quality is horrible... like a VHS or *early*, cheap DVD... blue-ray HD quality?!?!  Not even close!
2. Sound quality is horrible.  No bass at all.  Again... not even close to blue-ray or even CD or good MP3 quality.
3. Editing quality is horrible.  This is a personal opinion, not a technical quality issue.  Disclaimer, while I am in the ""MTV generation"", I'm older than 25 and do not have ADD.

Shame on Madonna for taking advantage of her fans and putting out such horrible quality.  I can only hope that she (for whatever reason) was not too involved in this and that someday they'll get the masters (assuming *their* quality is good) and *completely* redo this.  But I doubt it.  That costs money.  This release in no way comes even close to current standards, or even the great quality of her own previous releases.",1397606400,2,873,4.6103896103896105

I have a high-end home theater system (Marantz, Klipsch Cornwalls and Reference Series, Power Sound Audio).  On the first number, I had to boost the center channel volume by 3 db in order to hear Madonna over the band.  I then discovered the choice was made to place the drum track on the center channel along with her vocal lead so that her voice was stepped on by the boom of the bass drum.

That very first lot of faulty discs had to be withdrawn from stores. Well I bought this item earlier in 2014 and I think it belonged to that faulty lot. The sound is horrible to be Blu-ray technology, in most of the tracks you hear the crowd shouting higher than the singing and the music, so the music seems like the background noise when it should be otherwise. The player remote control doesn't work since the disc doesn't respond to the control buttons, you can't skip or go back a track, you can't go back to home menu or disc main menu and if you are trying to do that you have to stop the disc fully and play it from zero.

You can't even enjoy the show because as soon as your eyes are about to focus on something it cuts back to the crowd to cutting back to her to an overhead shot & all manners of colors and hues & most of the time it's not even really in focus.

Too Bad because I LOVE Madonna and LOVE the concert. This review is purely about the production of the Blu Ray, oherwise i would have given it a 5 star rating.",1389225600,,285,4.72

5985902,5,B00FEXL4BM,"Just got this today and it's FANTASTIC!!!  Glad they fixed the audio.  I saw the MDNA concert in Washington, DC and it was the BEST concert Madonna ever produced - and watching this was just like being at the show live!  If you missed seeing this live, this is the next best thing.  You'll be front and center watching the spectacle that is MADONNA.  If you have any doubt that Madonna IS ""The Queen of Pop"" ... you won't after watching this!",1388016000,2,442,4.341463414634147
5985903,5,B00FEXL4BM,5.1 surround sound now works and the production is phenomenal. A journey from  the perspective of characters from cinema and stage influence: a violent super vixen acting out her rage; a marching majorette with a take charge message; a call to be socially just in one's actions; a Vogueing catwalk; a Cabaret singer channeling her vulnerable place;  and an enlightened prophet of peace. Madonna puts on a show to rival all with 10 classic  hits revisited and much from her latest album MDNA. Fans will love it!,1387929600,2,510,4.839080459770115

5985905,1,B00FEXL4BM,I was told this was the new re-pressed version... I still got the defective blu-ray! Very disappointed. Madonna put on a great show but the discs sound and picture don't do anything for it. I want the new copy,1387238400,,209,4.384615384615385
5985906,5,B00FEXL4BM,"I just completed watching this concert on Amazon Prime...lucky me. Can there be any other female artist in our generation such as Madonna? absolutely not! Madonna, when the time comes, will leave, and has left an indelible mark in our culture, music, videos, dance, and fashion. IN the concert opens up with violence, guns, shootings death, blood. I was taken aback...yet she takes you on a journey from darkness to light. High light for me was her piano rendition of Like a Virgin going into Love Spent. Mixed with black and white still photography, dramatic, powerful and emotionally provoking. Over all MDNA was fast, fun...and the Queen of Pop shows the world no matter what age you are....you can still have fun and rock your world....after all...at 55 years old Madonna remains the quintessential Queen of Pop for over 30 years......",1386979200,,839,4.957446808510638

SO YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, BUT I THOUGHT BLU-RAY DVDS ARE MEANT TO HAVE BETTER QUALITY. I HAVE BOUGHT HER OTHER DVDS (SWEET& STICKY) & ( CONFESSIONS) AND THEY ARE GREAT.",1386115200,,392,4.3108108108108105
5985908,5,B00FEXL4BM,"Since they have fixed the 5.1 audio after they recalled defective Blu-rays, it is eons better. The audio is really booming and made my whole living room rumble. Picture is still the same, lots of editing effects causing intentional grain and filters, but I wasn't expecting that to change. The show itself is excellent and energetic.

5985911,4,B00FEXL4BM,"i almost bought this when it first came out but thanks to the reviews about the defective CD's, I waited.  I thought the quality of the video and sound were excellent!  The concert was a bit slow to start (could have lived without the gun play segment) but once it got moving it was a great show!  I think Madonna fans will find it awesome and even those who may not love all the newer songs will have enough of her past catalog to enjoy the show.",1385424000,,447,4.114942528735632
5985922,5,B00FEXL4BM,Her show was amazing in person and it was great to re-live the moments again.  Her concerts are not the cheesy ones you normally see where you hear the same silly songs from the radio played over and over.  This is more of a spiritual experience.,1385337600,,246,4.326086956521739

5985924,1,B00FEXL4BM,"Madonna has reminded us on more than one occasion that she spent 6 months editing the MDNA Tour DVD. Ironically, that is exactly the problem with the DVD! It has been edited to death! For some reason, Madonna seems to think that quality depends on the amount of editing involved.
Visuals are deliberately grainy. Footage has been taken from different tour dates so continuity is bad; facial expressions and the way clothing is worn constantly change within a single song. Visuals of the crowd are not in sync with the songs being perform, for example during Cyber Ragga you suddenly see a lot of shots of Indian fans in the crowd (LoL), which seems to have been recorded at different times. The color of some scenes are drowned in hues of red or blue. Certain action shots are shown in slow-motion. Video footage has been replaced with photos during Like a Virgin and Love Spent (what were they thinking?)!! Scenes alternate from color to black&white during some songs. Pre-recorded screen footage is super-imposed over the live performance footage resulting in an unclear, blurry haze. Sounds from the crowd have been deliberately altered and included at appropriate moments, sometimes louder than the live performance and at other times softer. Audio from different shows have been edited together and included with visuals that do not necessarily fit the audio.
It is a hatchet job of epic proportions!
Trying to turn a live performance into a music video by editing for 6 months was clearly a mistake. The DVD is a visual mess, lacking the quality and artistic integrity we have come to expect from an artist of Madonnas caliber. Furthermore, it is an insult to Madonna fans.",1385337600,26,1679,4.894736842105263

5985926,5,B00FEXL4BM,Long live the QUEEN. This IS the corrected Blu-ray! Thank you (Interscope) for correcting this fairly fast. Great concert. First half is kinda scary - waiting to see where it's going...........second half - great! This tour is music from MDNA and Hard Candy with only a very little sprinkle of reworked oldies. They are not like you remember and if this is your first time seeing a tour - it's a little disappointing to only hear a watered down version of a reworked hit. Still a great show. She is the queen of tickets sales and filled seats (at $400.00 a ticket - it's finally happened - Madonna is now a BILLIONAIRE!),1384732800,3,620,4.544642857142857
