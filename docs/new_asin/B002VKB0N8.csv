3996486,1,B002VKB0N8,"My husband and I just watched this on Netflix looking forward as we always do to a good Veggie Tales video. We were sorely disappointed in a few things:

1. This is mostly previously released material. The stories consist of the Tale of Flibber O Loo from the ""Are You My Neighbor?"" episode, Madame Blueberry from the ""Madame Blueberry"" episode, and Duke and the Great Pie war, from the ""Duke and the Great Pie War"" episode. While they fit fairly well into the theme of this DVD (loving people the way God has told us to in the Bible)most of the Veggie Tales episodes have at least a little something to do with love anyway, so it seems silly to release a special DVD that reuses old material to get the point across. In my opinion, it would have been better to do a thematic episode with new material, written specifically to illustrate the theme in a more pronounced and less subtle way.

2. There was a minimal amount of new material. I dislike it greatly when a company uses old material, throws in a bit of new stuff so that people collecting their products will buy it, and then releases it under a new title. I think it's unfair to consumers to be led to believe that they will be getting at least a little bit of new material so they should buy the product. I am very disappointed that a company that claims to promote Christian values would stoop to using this dirty trick to sell more DVDs.

3. The new material wasn't very good. It was supposed to be Larry interviewing a bunch of different kids on what love was and how we could show love to our neighbors and family and God. That could have at least been very powerful, if not a little funny because, let's face it, kids can be pretty funny. But I found it to be boring and repetitious. I couldn't wait for the actual stories to start. Admittedly, it was kind of cute, but not really funny like I expect from Veggie Tales. In my opinion, this could have been done much better.

4. I'm not sure if I should actually mention this one or not, because it could have been the computer that we watched it on or a number of other things, but the sound quality for the new material was terrible. We could barely hear the kids speaking at all and Larry's voice was also very quiet. The volume for the stories and the silly songs seemed to be just fine though. Again, this may not be an issue on the DVD.

All in all, we are very disappointed with this release from Big Idea and we are very relieved that we didn't actually buy this before watching it. I would recommend buying the original episodes instead of this poorly done compilation.",1285113600,5,2593,4.349173553719008
3996487,3,B002VKB0N8,"If you own other Veggie Tales titles, be sure to note that this includes mainly previously released material:
""The Story of Flibber-O-Loo,"" ""Duke and the Great Pie War,"" and ""Madame Blueberry.""  It's organized around a nice theme if you don't already own these titles: loving your neighbor, your family, and God. But don't miss the passing reference in the description to ""classic stories"" (translation: re-releases) and think this is brand-new material.",1265328000,28,454,5.394366197183099
