8146964,4,B000ION2HQ,"The BASERUNNING & BUNTING DRILLS dvd gives the viewer some very
refined techniques while on the bases and while bunting.
Key points for me were distinguishing the ""square bunt"" from the ""pivot bunt""
and the benefits of each. Also the ""delayed steal"" which is explained in detail.
Interesting strategy is bunting with two strikes. A no no unless you make it work.
Recommended only for coaches with guts!",1288742400,,402,4.926470588235294
8146965,4,B000ION2HQ,"Not only should Little League coaches and parents view this exciting
youth baseball resource, but players will benefit. Baserunning strategies
are taught with detailed explanations and baseball common sense.
Bunting techniques and when to use them work well. Combining these two subjects
makes this a great and easy resource to watch.

8146968,5,B000ION2HQ,"Unlike a former major leaguer telling us youth baseball coaches how to do it, I love it when a fellow baseball coach shares his on field coaching experience. And when you want to know about baseball in its most fundamental and basic form... Marty Schupak is the name you turn to. You will love these baserunning strategies and bunting drills. Coaches who feel they have the personnel and might go somewhere in All Star competition, should review this product. This DVD coupled with his previous DVDs & book are perfect source documents to increase your baseball IQ. I highly recommend this DVD.",1247961600,,594,4.833333333333333
8146969,5,B000ION2HQ,"I cannot express how much I loved this DVD. Putting ""small ball""
into my coaching strategies has made all the difference in the world with our team. We followed the techniques and drills at each and every practice spending 10-15 minutes on baserunning and bunting. Many of my players did not catch on right away and a few will never get it! But around the middle of the season we were bunting, doing the delayed steal and really became a different team! This DVD made an impact on our team. The results were obvious to other teams. It is rewarding when players grasp a baseball skill after some hard work (and fun)!",1246147200,,615,4.5
8146970,5,B000ION2HQ,"Wow! What a great video with excellent aggressive ideas. BASERUNNING & BUNTING DRILLS insists coaches can get 1-2 extra runs per game if they practice baserunning and bunting. Strategies like the BUNT MAN ON THIRD, almost guarantee a run as long as you practice. The BOUNCE & RUN DRILL puts players in the position on the base paths to get to the next base using great fundamental techniques. The bunting drills are by far the best I've seen. This stuff works! Coaches and parents who long for fundamentals in baseball will have a blast with this video. Anyone involved in youth baseball who eats, drinks & sleeps this stuff will not be disappointed.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1243382400,,675,4.827586206896552
8146971,5,B000ION2HQ,"I was fortunate that when I began coaching youth sports, the first video I got was one by Marty Schupak. I got hooked on his philosophies and saw incredible individual and team results! He came up to Massachusetts to do a coaches clinic and I cleared my schedule to attend. One of the main reasons for going was to hear his approach to baserunning and bunting. Not to be disappointed, he spoke about a lot of the material in this video. He is convincing about getting 1-2 extra runs per game if you practice baserunning and bunting at every practice. I remember him saying,

"" if you practice baserunning & bunting at every practice, you'll be the only coach in your league that does it. You'll see results as the season goes on.""

The video itself is one of the best resources I ever purchased. He goes through the techniques with the pivot bunt and the square bunt. He prefers the pivot bunt and gives concrete reasons but adds that if your players prefer the square bunt, let them do it.
The video combines clearly explained techniques with some very creative drills.

The baserunning part of the video is outstanding. He gives explanations about spending time each and every practice going over baserunning techniques. The drills he gives you will keep your players from getting bored.

The proof of the pudding is that our team looked to be a .500 team and we finished 14-6. We got at least two and maybe three extra wins because of our improved baserunning and bunting. This is a great youth baseball resource.

A DEFINITE 5 STAR VIDEO!",1242864000,,1542,4.613138686131387
