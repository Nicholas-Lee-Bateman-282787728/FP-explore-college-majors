8222029,3,B000WB9LAC,Thought it would be a video but it is actually still pictures. Lot of the same scene is of the ceiling of the hotel room while the narrator talks. Some interesting historical facts but...rather it would be a real video of flying the route.,1383177600,2,239,4.454545454545454
8222030,2,B000WB9LAC,"I thought, since this was a DVD, it would be just that.  A video of flying Route 66.  Its merely a slideshow.  Not worth the price!",1237939200,4,131,3.9615384615384617
