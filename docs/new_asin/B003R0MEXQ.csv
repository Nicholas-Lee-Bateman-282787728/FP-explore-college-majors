4175740,4,B003R0MEXQ,"In 2007, Shonda Rhimes (creator/executive producer of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and writer of ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"") developed a spin-off of ""Grey's Anatomy"" titled ""Private Practice"" based on the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh).

VIDEO:

""Private Practice - The Complete Fourth Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. Whereas ""Grey's Anatomy"" tends to be focused indoors, inside the hospital, ""Private Practice"" has a slick California look. Indoor scenes are well-lit and outdoor scenes are quite vibrant but viewers will notice the grain in the series. Even during the low-light scenes, you do see a bit of noise but compared to other drama series on television, the series is above average in terms of picture quality on DVD.

AUDIO:

As for audio, ""Private Practice - The Complete Fourth Season"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Possibly with the exceptions of the final episode with the sirens and episode 41 (Blow Ups), the series is primarily dialogue driven, so it's pretty much front and center channel driven.

The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Private Practice - The Complete Fourth Season"" includes the following special features:

DISC 5:

  An Inside Look: The Violation of Charlotte King - (13:13) Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers talk about exploring rape and how actress KaDee Strickland trained for the emotional scene.
  Deleted Scenes - Featuring eleven deleted scenes.
  Bloopers - (2:15) ""Private Practice"" season 4 bloopers

EXTRAS:

""Private Practice - The Complete Fourth Season"" comes with a slipcase cover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers definitely had to face a major hurdle with season three in order to bring back the fans who were skeptical about the show's longevity.  And suffice to say, they accomplished that goal.

Now with season four, how would the writers continue their success in making sure that ""Private Practice"" remains to be a strong, well-written show but most of all, utilize its characters.

And sure enough, it's about focusing on the characters and their relationships.

Season four of ""Private Practice"" focuses on tragedy and heartbreak.  The series started up strong with the rape of Dr. Charlotte King and with her character typically being shown as cold-hearted, we had the opportunity to see the writers make her character appealing but also warm-hearted and frail.  We know she is strong-willed but the connection she has with Cooper Freedman and the happiness he brings to her life is well-done.  This season, this couple has become my favorite of the series because of their fragile love but the fact that they are opposites that truly compliment each other.

The writers found a way to explore their characters and take them out of their comfort zone and explore... from the rape, to them trying to fix their relationship to their planned wedding.

The other story arc focused on Addison but instead of having too much Addison storylines, the writers also did a good job of not focusing on her character too much but spreading the story evenly but not over indulge the viewer with Addison this and Addison that.  Addison's relationship with her mother and family but also her relationship with Sam and also Naomi was nicely done.

Addison is a complex character with a lot of instability but also deep inside, she is a beautiful woman that is caring and vibrant if given the storyline to showcase the positive and emotional side of her.  And its good to see that.

And then there is Peter Wilder and Violet Turner.  Violet had an emotional season three, this time around she's appeared to be the more headstrong character but at the same time, her relationship and marriage with Peter will probably be tested from what takes place in season four.  Violet had a lot to face near the end of season four, as did Peter...but there is no doubt that this couple will be going through challenges for season five, especially what happened at the end of the season finale.  Actress Amy Brennerman was given her moment to shine towards the end of the season with another emotional performance and as for Tim Daly, makes you wonder what the writers are trying to do with his character, especially with how things concluded in the season finale.

With that being said, I do feel the writers felt that Naomi and Sam were a bit difficult to focus on because while they do play an important role in each episode, compared to last year which focused on their daughter, it seems that they were the least focused on this season.  So, perhaps because they were focused on so much in season three, the writers took a step back with these two characters.  With the announcement that Audra McDonald would not be returning as a regular cast member, it may answer why she wasn't portrayed as much in the series but also why the changes with the hospital took place.

As for Amelia Shepherd, we are starting to see the writers utilize her character even more but there is no doubt that her problems as a recovering addict, will no doubt creep back and hurt this talented doctor.  She showed a lot of enthusiasm but hopefully her character is explored a bit more in season five.

And for Sheldon Wallace, he definitely had a role this season but more of a supporting role for each of the characters as he is the go-to guy when everyone is having emotional problems.  But it would be great to see him integrated a bit more in season five.

This season, I definitely have to say that I enjoyed it.  Well-written storylines, the chemistry among the actors worked very well.  We had solid performances by KaDee Strickland, Kate Walsh, Paul Adelstein and Peter Wilder and everyone else in the cast.  But KaDee Strickland definitely had to make her storyline work and seem real and she accomplished that.  Great emotional performance!

I did enjoy the introductions of Dr. Rodriguez (played by Cristian de la Fuente) and also bringing in Jake Reilly (played by Benjamin Bratt) as a possible love interest for Addison but losing Audra McDonald, hopefully this means better character development for the character of Amelia Shepherd but I hope the alcoholic or the junkie storyline doesn't get overplayed for next season as it is quite cliche for medical dramas.

As for the DVD box set, it would be nice if audio commentary was featured.  Granted, the last season box sets didn't really come with that many special features but it would be nice to have the director or writers and cast take part in one, especially for the more shocking episodes or the season finale.  But overall, ""Private Practice - The Complete Fourth Season"" was a solid set with a few special features and also with good picture quality and audio quality.

Overall, ""Private Practice"" was an entertaining season.  The writers managed to to keep the season entertaining, especially from a well-done season four.  Each episode was quite entertaining, also a good dose of very emotional episodes as well.  I do like how the writers made sure everyone in the series had a significant role and that was a major plus.  So, with the new changes at the end of season four, I definitely look forward to what the writers have in store for season 5.

""Private Practice - The Complete Fourth Season"" is recommended!",1335571200,,10746,4.765056972327726

4175749,4,B003R0MEXQ,"Frankly, i watched the first two season of the show because I'm a huge Kate Walsh fan but the season 1 & 2 were nothing special. Season 3 was a step towards improvement and it showed and season 4 is the best season so far. I'll break down each character's storyline:
1) Addison: Addie had an on and off relationship with Sam. She wants a baby but Sam doesn't. Ultimately, she'll have to choose between the two. Addie's mother, Bizzy returns this season and puts her in a position which screws with her head badly. Personally, I thought the Bizzy storyline was well written and realistic. In the finale, Addison got a new love interest in Benjamin Bratt. Season 5 will tell who'll she end up with and will she finally get her wish...a baby.
2) Charlotte and Cooper: Early on this season, Char gets assaulted and raped. This entire storyline was beautifully handled. KaDee Strickland showed her talent and proved herself with this difficult role. Cooper is with Char every step of the way, holding her hand and being a nice boyfriend. Char and Coop finally become true to each other and get married.
3) Sam: He is confused between Naomi and Addison but neither are on the same page as him. He wants to be with Addie but she grows apart and he struggles with the relationship.
4) Naomi: She realizes her responsibilities as a grandmother and inherits millions from her boyfriend William White after his death. Gabriel returns this season and gives Nae an interesting proposition. She also realizes that she ain't happy at the practice anymore and moves to DC with Gabriel and Dell's daughter, Betsey in the finale.
5) Violet: She finally gets married to Pete after some initial hesitation. She writes a book on her traumatic experience with Katie which doesn't go well with the others and Katie, who sues her. The finale left a big question mark about her future, both professional and personal. She really needs to set her priorities straight before it's too late.
6) Pete: He's happily married to Violet till his estranged brother shows up asking him for help for his estranged mother. Pete's family storyline showcases his past nicely. The season cliffhanger this time focuses on Pete as he has a heart stroke in the end. We know he isn't gonna die but it'll be interesting to see what happens.
7) Amelia: It is revealed that Amelia is a recovering substance abuser and struggles with it and that puts her job in jeopardy. She finally rekindles her relationship with Derek.
8) Sheldon: He doesn't do much this season except advising his colleagues. I hope he gets a girl in Season 5 and a real storyline.
On the whole, the season was awesome! Interesting patient storylines as well. You'll be hooked. As a loyal PP fan, I can't wait for season 5. The Season 4 DVD is a must buy!",1314835200,9,2778,4.659877800407332
4175750,5,B003R0MEXQ,"Well... This season of Private Practice was just overall amazing. When i started Private Practice, it was only because of Addison, who was my favorite character on Grey's Anatomy. I thought the first season was pretty good, so i kept watching. BUT, season two was complete crap. I almost stopped watching, but after the cliffhanger at the end, i had to watch season three, and I am very happy i did, cuz season three was great, and i got back to loving it. With the ending of Dell's death, you don't think anything worse could happen to these people, but in the 7th episode, Charlotte gets raped, which was so hard to watch. She was one of my favorites and seeing this happen to her almost put me in tears, the show definitely gained attention for this story arc. The rest of the season deals with her coping with it all, and how it affects everyone around her. I still don't really like Amelia Shepherd though, she is very annoying. Also, one of the main characters leaves the show at the end. This is a great season, so definitely buy it, and watch for season 5 :)",1314576000,,1066,4.416243654822335
