811385,5,630422513X,"John Sayles is one of the best--and certainly among the most interesting--American directors working in film today.  Self-financed on a small budget, using his large number of talented friends as cast and crew,  Sayles crafts films that owe allegiances to no one but himself.  Virtually  never does he make the same film twice, and almost all of them are a great  pleasure to watch.
""Lone Star"" is Sayles' masterpiece.  It  succeeds on every level: as mystery, as romance, as social commentary.  Set  in a Texas border town, it creates a rich world peopled with characters and  situations we understand and identify with.
There is plot, mood, color,  drama, passion suspense and even humor, but if pressed to say what it  really is about, I would say that the theme is how the present is a product  of the past, and how people are given opportunities to be imprisoned by it  or to transcend it.
""Lone Star"" is one of only two American  films of this decade (the other is ""Shindler's List"") to which I  would give a '10'.  It's been a long time since I have felt so thoroughly  challenged, entertained and satisfied by a single piece of art.",931651200,20,1140,4.64321608040201
811386,5,630422513X,"I love this film. ""Lone Star"" is simulanteously a mystery, a romance, and a meditation on the cultural history of the US. I saw it in San Antonio in an audience which was about 60/40 Hispanic/Anglo. Thus far,  it is the movie-going experience of my life.
Conservatives who rever the  past and consider modern America to be in moral decay - see this film. It  presents a bold counter-arguement.",916358400,2,393,4.666666666666667
811387,5,630422513X,"One of the best if not the best movie I have ever seen. Unfortunately it is not for sale in Denmark, so I had to rent it 5 times!
First of all the love story is soothingly mature, which is a rarity these days. Secondly the  plot is tight, the dialogue exquite and the pictures full. Thirdly,  performing is so genuine you can almost touch the actors. Kris  Kristofferson should definately have won the Oscar Academy Award for his  dangerous, fascinating, and all-evil sherif of yesterday.
In addition to  these points, the movie presented to me very unfamiliar topics such as  Mexican immigration and the relation between Afro-American and  Native-American people. Now I know how come the seminoles made patchwork (I  wondered about that for 10 years).
Finally 'Lone Star' take use of very  strange technique, as past and present go on at the same time - at least in  the same room. See it!",915580800,,890,4.683870967741935

811462,3,630422513X,Before Matthew McConaughey started doing all his rom/coms.  He should he could be a serious actor with this.  And also A Time To Kill.  This is a very good movie.  One that you have to sit down and watch and not be disitracted.  It's a mystery about the murder of a corrupt lawman.  And you get drawn deeper and deeper into the story as it unfolds in flashbacks.

811546,5,630422513X,"This film is John Sayles' masterpiece.  With the exception of ""Silver City"", he hasn't been responsible for a bad film and most of his films deserve at least three stars. Sayles is one of the few filmmakers who writes, edits and directs his movies. Like Hitchcock he usually appears in his films in a small role or a cameo.  Also like John Ford and Clint Eastwood, Sayles makes use of a stock company of crew people and actors.  Part of the fun of watching a John Sayles film is identifying the actors as they appear. Also, part of the fun is determining exactly how and to what extent  each film cinematically expresses Sayles' recurring themes.  Sayles, as an independent artist, is a hero to many in Hollywood. He does what many aspiring and actual filmmakers wish they could do: make films with a strong social message without the compromises inherent in commercial considerations.  Sayles is an unapologetic man of the Left. However, judging by his commentary in ""Limbo"" and ""Sunshine State"", he doesn't make the mistake many liberal artist's make of turning his character's into mere mouthpieces for his agenda. Sayles is soft spoken, inquiring and intellectual, not strident and angry.  As a political conservative, I appreciate Sayles approach. ""Lonestar"" tells a great story in which Sam Deeds comes to terms with who is father is as the murder mystery unfolds.  This is especially interesting since---after viewing the film again---I noticed that there seems to be a lack of happy nuclear families in Sayles films. There are plenty of childless couples, single parents or single people.  Is this deficit unintended or is it indicative of a conscious agenda?",1486425600,3,1667,4.967625899280575

811677,5,630422513X,"It was a close call but I decided to give LONE STAR a 5 star rating because it does get better upon another viewing (kind of like a good book).  John Sayles, not surprisingly, intended to be a novelist, and it is in the detail of his scripts that you can see this early passion.  Really no need to add much more about Lone Star and its story of indigenous people (Mexican AND Indians) and the white 'man' that ran this Texas border town with a vicious, iron fist.  That's just part of the story.  This movie is subtle (which sometimes means long) in its character development and detail (except corrupt Kris Kristofferson Texas sheriff - in flashback extremely 1-sided), and is even subtle in its modern, film noir story and look (there is a real clever driving at night sequence that is - subtle of course - seen in a split screen, with white lines of the highway...driver thinking, suspicious of the past...)
But, if you like John Sayles movies (""Matewan"", ""City of Hope"" - forgotten, it seems, very underrated I think; ""Eight Men Out"") you will like this.  Sayles likes to use same actors like Chris Cooper (starred in Matewan; small part City of Hope) and Joe Morton (City of Hope) who, simply, are good actors.  If the viewer can't enjoy multiple stories with characters whose paths eventually cross - whether it's only the climax or not - are not going to appreciate the plot(s), intentions, and/or politics of a director who had planned on being a novelist.
John Sayles is still novel in his own way though.  LONE STAR is a prime example of that.
A post script for actress Elizabeth Pena who - as an Hispanic actress - I have the sad feeling, had a difficult time continuing to receive the significant parts she deserved (she was also in ""Jacobs Ladder"" - very memorable dance nightmare sequence - and ""LaBamba"").  Her role in LONE STAR is quite significant.  And, like this movie, when you find yourself thinking about it, her performance you realize was quite authentic.
Sadly, she passed at the age of 55 rather unnoticed.",1457654400,2,2032,4.622222222222222

811700,5,630422513X,"Growing up in a small town in which your father is a local hero is almost bound to be something of a psychological determinant in anyones developing sense of self: and so it is with Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper), having to live under the weight of his late father, Buddys seemingly unassailable reputation as a man of honour and integrity. It was Buddy (Matthew McConaughey), when a deputy, who rid the town of the notorious Sheriff Charlie Wade (Kris Kristofferson) thereby ending his tyrannical reign.

To mark the life of such a man, the towns mayor  also a previous deputy alongside Buddy  Hollis Pogue (Clifton James), proposes to erect a permanent memorial to his one-time colleague outside the local courthouse, which they are also going to name in Buddys honour.

But, as you might imagine, all is not what it seems and this is thrown into sharp relief by the discovery of the remains of a man buried in a shallow grave just outside town on a long disused army firing range.

The discovery is made by two off-duty soldiers pursuing an amateur archaeological hobby and armed, this time, with just a handy metal detector. And it throws up another important artefact in terms of what will subsequently unfold as the sands of time are blown away by Sams increasingly uneasy investigation into the crime and, as a corollary, his own past; the corroding remains of a sheriffs badge in the form of a lone star.

This is a masterful film: brilliantly written, edited and directed by John Sayles and deserves a lot more attention than it probably gets.  Chris Cooper, in a rare big screen lead role, imbues the character of Sam with just the right ingredients of pathos, integrity, regret and wistfulness; a kind of mature Sheriff July Johnson, his earlier role in that other elegiac western, Lonesome Dove.  He is more than ably supported by Kris Kristofferson as the odious Charlie Wade, and Clifton James as the somewhat hapless Hollis Pogue, amongst a stellar cast of first rate actors.",1445817600,,1992,4.7871720116618075

There were also a couple of sub-plots in the movie regarding a shooting of a black young adult man in a bar. This movie also touches on the issue of immigration of Mexicans coming into Texas.

Sayles can render history, with all its confusion and wildly varying points of view, better than any film maker outside of the Burns brothers. Many complain of the multiple story lines. They are wrong. In the first place, they are an accurate representation of the racial/ethnic/historical complexity of the region, as anybody familiar with the Southwest will tell you. (New Mexico, in my case, going back to my grandfather.) In the second place, they are so artfully rendered, especially by a long, long list of wonderful actors, that the entertainment and the information blend seamlessly and utterly painlessly.

The sound track is worth buying separately  - each song fits the scene or the action perfectly.

 kris kristofferson plays such a snake that he is quoted as having struggled in deciding whether to take the role or not because he knew that someday his kids would probably see the movie.  If you know of him and of his life, that says a lot.

The acting is superb and the actors do justice to the script.,1438992000,,349,4.303030303030303

811771,5,630422513X,It's a western and it's not a western. A sheriff is researching the past of his father who was the beloved sheriff of a small town.

Major Spoiler Alert

The facts as collected by Sam Deeds Elected Sheriff of a Texas Border Town.

u He was brought in 2 years ago as a white Sheriff with the same surname as his father Buddy Deeds was electable in a town that is now 90% Hispanic, 5% Black, and 5% White.
u As the story begins the bones of a white man are discovered on the grounds of a former desert army base complete with masons ring and sheriffs badge.
u His Fathers predecessor, the corrupt Charlie Wade disappeared without a trace at about the same time as the bones are dated.
u At the same time $10,000 in county funds disappeared.
u At 15 his father forbids him to continue dating his Hispanic girlfriend.
u Her father was murdered by Charlie Wade 18 months before she was born.
u Buddy Deeds bought a restaurant for the girls mother.
u The girl was sent to a convent school for her last 2 years of high school.

A side-plot involves the owner of a black night-club whose son moves in as commandant of the local army base and whose grandson noses around.

812066,5,630422513X,"This is a very interesting Western. I won't go into the story as there are already many Reviews that have given details as to what the movie is about.
 So,what did I find so interesting?
Well,what this movie really about is the Old West,brought up to date with a story set on the Texas/ Mexico border,not in 1870 or 1880,but in the mid 1950's. Things are really different these days ,the demographics are pretty much the same with Mexicans,Blacks and Whites. There are still the powerful,some good and some bad,prejudices continue, but different as political correctness moves in,The automobile has replaced the horse,the local saloon is still the center of the town's activity,handguns are now pretty much the realm of law enforcement. Shootouts are a thing of the past,and on and on. The characters have more depth and are very well developed and magnificently played by top acctors. There area lot of excellent songs.
Naturally,being in the 1950,s there are no train robberies,no stagecoach hold-ups,no cattle drives or stampedes,and no sitting around a campfire at night.
 However,as with an old Western,it is a good story,and gives a good insight into the lives of a group of people and their thoughts ,actions, motives,loves and hates.
 This movie will convince you that a movie with all of the elements of a great Old Weststern can still be written about the present times,people and places.

All of this is set in a small Texas town on the Mexican border.and is beautifully photographed in southwestern Texas. Kris Kristofferson is utterly magnificent as tough but brutally corrupt sheriff in flashback scenes as he is challenged by his younger deputy(Matthew McConaughey).

812269,3,630422513X,"I basically liked this movie, but there are a few glaring errors in the scenes of Army personnel that almost ruined it. The end
credits list a Lt. Col. as ""military advisor"", but he likely wasn't on set when these scenes were filmed. Did anyone else notice
these?
1) In the scene where Otis's son the Colonel visits him in the bar, I'm pretty sure the eagle insignias on his epaulets are UPSIDE
DOWN! It's a little hard to see, but I think I'm right. A full bird colonel who doesn't know how his rank insignia is displayed? Come on! Maybe someone with a Blu-Ray player could verify this.
2) The female private has 2 scenes where she's being interviewed in offices while wearing her BDU hat. Soldiers don't wear hats
indoors.
3) In the scene where the private is being interviewed by the full colonel in his office (while wearing a hat she shouldn't be wearing)
the rank chevron on the hat is clearly UPSIDE DOWN! The colonel even helpfully straightens out her hat for her, while staring directly at the upside down chevron. Doesn't even notice. These errors are so egregious, I almost have to wonder if they were done deliberately, but why? Maybe to make the colonel and private look like a couple of clueless imbeciles? Then, to end the interview,the colonel salutes the private, who returns his salute. Totally bass-ackwards. The junior member always salutes first.
  All minor gripes in an otherwise good movie, I know, but they stand out like big, glaring neon signs to me, taking me out of
the story and almost ruining the movie.",1404345600,2,1534,4.636029411764706

The way the story slowly unfolds, the realistic dialogue, the tensions and even hatred of sons for their fathers, and the terrific wrap-up. Thank you John Sayles.

  The script, directing, acting and production are so honestly brilliant, were the story not captivating alone, it would remain an incredible film.  Flawless as THE major descriptive term for this movie, has rarely, if ever, been applied to anything so justifiably.
  One of the most unique and clever literarily devices, used in this film, is the manner/mode of time transition scenes used to move from a characters memory to the present.  My descriptive ability is not adequate to do justice to this device, therefore, I urge you to view the film and decide for yourself.

Instead I received a dissertation on race relations at the boarder, and a story centered around an infallible protagonist.  It reminds me a lot of ""Higher Learning"" in which all the progressive minded characters are empathetic sages of wisdom, and any conservative characters are one dimensional xenophobic bigots.  So like another reviewer stated, it's basically a story that could've been told in 10 minutes inflated into an over two hour opus, so that its writer/director can push a thinly veiled political agenda. In the end conservatives will enjoy this about as much as liberals love Red Dawn. Your enjoyment of this movie depends on your political affiliation and if you like being preached to.

If you want a good contemporary western that is apolitical watch ""Extreme Prejudice"".

812663,5,630422513X,"Chris Cooper,one of John Sayles' stable of actors,has given the performance of his career in Lone Star,a masterpiece of a noir thriller, set in Tex-Mex country. As Sam Deeds,he stumbles on a murder mystery that might involve his legendary father Buddy Deeds(Mathew McConaughey,played in flashback).A skeleton is found in the sand and Sam and many others may wish it had stayed buried. This is one of the skeletons in the closet of the border town of Frontera,evidence of past racism and violence centred around Charley Wade(Kristofferson).This film is one of the best of all time,for its plotting,story, character,performances and camera work. Cooper plays the honest sheriff seeking to get to the truth of what just did happen in the past,still in his father's shadow,questioning his father's associates like Hollis(James),or those who experienced the wrath of Charley Wade,like Otis(Canada),bar-owner. Was Sam's father the killer of Charley Wade?

The Charley/Buddy scenes are masterfully played by McConaughey and Kristofferson-played as they are in flashback mode,as townspeople reminisce about what happened. We also have a complex human drama centred on borderlands and racial hybridity,in the debate between Native-American,American,African-American and Hispanic townsfolk about the conflicting patrimony of these dry and dusty grasslands,as well as the love story between Sam and Pilar(Pena),who had a high-school love,broken and taken up again. Sayles elevates the mystery to a question of larger American identities,beautifully realized by Sayles expressive script and Cooper's subtle acting. Sayles' camera style is distinctive, marking transitions between past and present with a simple movement from one part of the frame to another. We see a young,scared Mexican hiding under a bridge,then the camera starts to pan up, to move along the under side of the bridge and up to the boots of a sheriff standing on the bridge looking down. And it is 30 years later and these are the boots of Sam Deeds. By finding out this story we find out the story of a whole town,how the lives and the worlds intersect. Superb use of music. Masterly.",1335657600,,2143,5.416167664670659
812664,5,630422513X,"Multi-threaded plot lines weave an intricate pattern of relationships, both personal and cultural, creating a film that continues to please across many screenings.  Rio County, just across the border from Mexico, is struggling with many issues including the cultural clashes between whites, afro-americans and, most notably, hispanics.  The central story is essentially a love story between the current sheriff of Rio County, played masterfully by Chris Cooper, and a widowed school teacher, Elizabeth Pena.  Yet, this love story is wedded to a murder mystery which exposes layers and layers of history which has a significant impact on the present.  As Pena's character explains to a mixed group of somewhat hostile white and Hispanic parents, the honest effort to understand the past without prejudice is the only way the we can come to fully understand the present.  This was put in the context of relations of the various cultural groups in this small area.  Yet, her words come to have personal significance on the scale of Greek tragedy by the final scene.  Before a towering blank movie screen at a deserted, weed infested, drive-in movie theater,  they, the sheriff and the schoolteacher, are invited to write their own future given their new found understandings which, like the menudo referenced by a grisly bartender in an earlier scene, makes a complex dish of many, many elements.

This is a brilliantly conceived and beautifully executed film where the hard action comes not with guns and fists but in the revelations from the past, softly and with a terribly sweet sadness.",1335139200,2,1588,5.147859922178989

Chris Cooper heads an excellent cast, playing the son of a legendary sheriff of a Texas border county.  He himself is now the sheriff, but had issues with his father while growing up.  Writer/director/editor John Sayles does brilliant work with the screenplay, salted with interesting characters.  The skeletal remains of a man are found in an old rifle range and Cooper's character begins an investigation.  Sayles' story turns up more figurative skeletons as the story develops.  I was also impressed with Elizabeth Pena who I'd only seen in stereotyped work before.  She's brilliant here.  Sayles most impressive component of this film is how he manages the scene changes from the current time to the flashback setting.  Slow camera pans make it easy for the audience to follow the story.

812667,5,630422513X,"Lone Star is one of my favorite movies of all time. It can be enjoyed on many levels. It's a detective story as everything revolves around the effort to resolve a decades old murder. It's a romance that finds once young lovers rekindling an old flame. It's a generational story that examines the relationship of fathers and sons. And it's a sociological examination of the interaction of the various ethic groups that live together in south Texas. It all comes together in one great movie in which the common thread is the question of whether it is better to remember or forget one's history. The dialog is smart and often laugh-out-loud funny, providing bits of comic relief. The camera work--especially in moving back and forth from present day to the past-- is artfully done. The acting featuring the underrated Chris Cooper, Kris Kristofferson, and Elizabeth Pena and a terrific ensemble cast is outstanding.

The many plot twists, turns, and insightful look at this small Texas towns crimson past, and present day struggles concerning class, race, and politics makes for an unusually entertaining, and insightful drama. And like the great classic Westerns of the past John Sayles' modern day passion play presents us with a cast of characters whose different viewpoints and ambiguous characters are presented in both positive and negative terms minus the black, white cowboy hats. We are reminded that despite the often confusing complex  class, cultural issues that we as Americans  are faced with we have for centuries solved many of these issues on a more individualistic, and personal level then on a political one.

 The twist and turns of  plot leading to the the shocking  discovery of Chris Cooper's fathers past romantic discretions are what make ""LONESTAR"" a true classic.  What is this film about, LIFE, and the tale is told superbly by John Sayles.

The subplots and politics of race and life go hand in hand. The scary Kris Kristofferson character is one all too real, {growing up in the South,  I knew of a few sheriff's like that!} a lawman who uses the law for his own gain, or rather his rule of his law. The other characters all add flavor to this. How  Sayles tied this all up was true genius.

The passing of the torch of the  town and the political force to  a different generation only are amplified by the passage of time since this was released. Yet, the white, black and hispanic communities of this film all are intertwined much more easily with the telling of the tale of ""Charlie Wade""  and his rise and fall.

812736,5,630422513X,"""Lone Star"" is a gripping murder mystery set in a Texas border town. It keeps you entertained while exploring a profound theme: the borders that divide us, whether between countries like Mexico and the U.S., between parents and children, races and classes, citizens and immigrants, myths and reality.

""Lone Star"" was written and directed by the acclaimed indie filmmaker John Sayles. Sayles's films are slow-paced but in a good way. They include multi-dimensional characters and are intelligently written with good dialogue and realistic human conflict. If you have patience and stay with the stories, you will be richly rewarded. Sayles created an unforgettable portrait of coal miners struggling to start a union in 1920's West Virginia in ""Matewan."" He chronicled the creeping corruption and loss of idealism generated by the Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919 with ""Eight Men Out.""

In light of all the venomous debates about immigration these days, ""Lone Star"" is one of the most thoughtful and prescient movies of the last 20 years. It deserves a much larger audience than it got on its release in 1995. On this DVD, it looks great in its wide screen format. It is truly an American classic.",1284076800,2,1197,5.040404040404041

It is a bit hard to follow as it tells a story in flashbacks--jumps from the present to the past.  But it is a great story of a subject that is overlooked in American Cinema--the clash in the Southwest between the Anglos and the Mexicans, and the misery that was heaped on the Mexicans by the Anglos.  It is a story that has been going on for almost 200 years but has yet to be told.  After seeing this you will understand the saying, ""Mexicans never crossed the border, the border crossed them.""",1283817600,,594,4.372727272727273

They could have shaved at least twenty minutes off this film, leaving out some of the dragging dialogue in the third act which added nothing of substance to the film that hadn't already been previously introduced, and had a much better film for the effort. The first 60% of the film had me very interested, but somewhere around the last 45-60 minutes it just started to bog down in unecessary dialogue, dragging from scene to scene, and by the last 30 minutes I found myself just fast forwarding through a couple of the more irrelevant draggy scenes, something I very seldom do. It is not a bad movie, the themes are relevant, and the acting is satisfactory. It is just that the execution lacks.",1282089600,,838,4.556291390728477
812739,3,630422513X,"I had just watched a new movie, Staten Island, and thought, hey, this is a really solid, great all-around film.  Not particularly groundbreaking, but it's really very nice to have a good up to par status quo, and it was quite enjoyable.  Sometimes I'm just not in the mood for groundbreaking.  And I then I thought of this film, Lone Star, because that's what I had heard about it when it came out.  So I decided to go back and re-watch it.  I didn't agree then, however, and I don't agree now.

As soon as the fonts of the opening credits come up I get the feeling that I'm watching something a little campy.  It's like a soap-opera graphic novel, a dimestore Jesse James sortof deal that puts on airs of modernity without being some really cool modern comic like Watchmen or something.  Despite some fairly detailed and believable caricatures, things seem to drag, and it doesn't actually go anywhere.  What seems like some sort of attempt at redemption of the sins of the father (as the saying goes), in fact just ends up a rebirth of a whole new generation of messed-uppedness, and all criticisms about the past or trying to pretend like it didn't happen are thrown out the window by more attempts to pretend like the past didn't happen.

What are sold as tiny victories are really just little surrenders.  Caricatures that really only start out in faded colors become increasingly bleached out to charcoal sketches and the wild-west flavor becomes an excuse to throw up your arms and simply rely on the outlines.  ""Everything is too chaotic!""--even though nothing is particularly chaotic or unexpected in any of the film.  Somehow the color of this film ends up making everything black and white.

In the end, all ideas of reconciliation are just plain chucked out the window in the last half hour or so of the film.  I'm sitting there thinking, hey, how are they ever going to make any sense out of this mess, much less make it right?  Well, they don't.  It just becomes too inconvenient.

Frankly, I like a movie like Out of Time, which I think has some similarities genre-wise, because it's less campy and more redemptive.  But maybe the comparison isn't apt because of the 7 year gap between the two films.  Lone Star's worth a watch, I guess, and more complicated than maybe the box cover lets on, but, in my opinion, way overrated.",1273276800,2,2342,4.624697336561743
812740,5,630422513X,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film, but what I got was far more than I bargained for.  One of those dusty western films that is far from dusty, `Lone Star' works more like a crime noir with a dash of thriller and volatile romance thrown in as apposed to a western by definition.  It is rich with startling character development (whoever said these people are stereotypical caricatures needs to get a reality check) and engrossing from beginning to end.

`Lone Star' is by far one of the best films of the 90's you may have never seen.

Chris Cooper (complete with sunken demeanor and pent-up sorrow) plays Sam, a young sheriff who starts asking too many questions when a skeleton wearing a badge gets uncovered outside his town.  Sam starts sticking his nose where it don't belong (well, it belongs there, but townsfolk think otherwise) and begins to unravel a tale that answers some longstanding questions about his own father and the life he once led.

The film is very easy to follow, but it carries with it a twisted tale, so your attention is demanded.  Don't be too worried about that, since the payoff is very rewarding, and the final scene between Cooper and the luminous Elizabeth Pena is such a mindblow that it just warrants another viewing.

The films central morale, of self discovery and acceptance, is gloriously handled throughout the film, and the script just covers every base without feeling too stuffed, too rushed or too flimsy.  It is the perfect balance of emotional connection and political correction.  The controversial subjects such as race relations, family development, political corruption and misguided loyalties are all explored adequately and carefully so as to appear fluid and complete as apposed to an amalgam of ideas with no real sound structure.

The film couldn't have been made any better.

And then we have the performances, all of which are stellar.  Chris Cooper is brilliantly subtle here, gliding through each scene with a restraint that elevates his character's development.  Elizabeth Pena harnesses a sensuality that she breaks apart here in order to convey the appearance of a worn and tattered woman who still breathes a fire that just cannot be extinguished.  Kris Kristofferson is evil to a T here, capturing fear and handing it to the audience without hesitation, and Matthew McConaughey ACTUALLY DELIVERS here.  This may be his finest performance, albeit a small one.  He has the natural cowboy swagger (does that term work here) to make his performance work.

And we can all bow to the glorious Francis McDormand, who makes the most (and I mean THE MOST) of a beautifully fleshed out cameo.

So, I promise you, `Lone Star' is all the movie you need.  If you haven't seen this brilliant film I urge you to seek it out as soon as possible.  With the dirt covered grunge of a western, this crisply tailored exploration of humanity exceeds expectations and remains on of the best films of the 90's; easy.",1258070400,5,2991,4.825490196078431

Cooper, Pena, and then-unknown McConaughey are superb in their roles, and Kristofferson stands out as the mean, rough-edged, intimidating Wade.

812919,5,630422513X,"There have been six Masterpieces produced in American Cinema that go to the heart of being an american (if this doesn't start a war I don't know what will!).  They are in order:

Citizen Kane - 1941

Casablanca - 1942

The Last Picture Show - 1971

American Graffitti - 1973

Parenthood - 1989

Lonestar - 1996

They vary as much as they remain cohesive.  They were made by visionary Directors, with the exception of Casablanca which represents the best of American film making by committee, and they all share one American attribute that will garner them immortality - they have Heart.

Few films can compare, none can surpass.

While The Last Picture Show is the best of the lot in that it captures the changing of our country from rural to urban from the fifties onward and the beginning of the ache for that lost Americana, Lonestar does the same thing with the results of those changes we are all experiencing now - proving that that ache still resonates in our souls.

The other four movies deal with different aspects of the American experience, but do so equally well in their own arena.

812920,4,630422513X,"""Lone Star"" is another amazing John Sayles film.  It takes place in a small Texas town on the Rio Grande.  The town is shaped by the constant influx of Mexicans hoping for a better life.  It begins with the discovery in the desert of a skull, a Masonic ring, and a sheriff's badge. The present sheriff is the son of a past, deceased sheriff who is revered by the residents.  By investigating the death in the desert, he starts uncovering secrets from before he was born.  As a son, he never knew his father the same way everyone else knew him.  Part of his investigation is curiosity about who his father really was.

Meanwhile, an Army colonel who left town never expecting to return again finds himself in command of the Army base there, where his father is ""the mayor of Darktown"", i.e. the informal leader of the African-American community.  The colonel is both a son of this man, and a father to his own son, who is also curious about his heritage.

The third family to be explored is that of the sheriff's high school sweetheart who is now a teacher in that same school.  Her mother, a Mexican, is a pillar of the community and owns a successful restaurant. Again, the teacher is both a daughter of a stern, disapproving mother and a mother to her own children, who are teenagers with teenager problems.

The histories of these three families are interwoven with creative use of flashbacks and the dogged investigation by the sheriff of the death of the murdered sheriff.  As the sheriff explores the classic principles of motive and opportunity for a murder that happened before he was born, he learns more than he wanted to know about the history of his town and his family.",1177200000,4,1682,4.57
812921,5,630422513X,"""Lone Star"" is director John Sayles's brilliantly subtle, deliberately paced and multi-layered dissection of a murder investigation in a small Texas border town.  The corpse of a long-missing former sheriff is discovered, triggering an investigation by the current sheriff (played by Chris Cooper). As the investigation proceeds, the sheriff begins to suspect the involvement of his own father (played by Matthew McConaughey), a now deceased town hero, who was also his predecessor as sheriff.  The son has lived long in the shadow of a father with whom he had many issues, and will seek the truth about his father in pushing the investigation to its bitter end.

Sayles tells the story in a nicely parallel fashion in the past and present, as we learn that the murdered sheriff (played with venemous malice by Kris Kristofferson) was a corrupt murderer and racist who ran the town like a personal fiefdom.  The character played by McConaughey was one of his deputies, who may or may not have stood up to the corrupt sheriff.

Elizabeth Pena plays the childhood love interest of the present day sheriff.  The two of them attempt to revive their relationship but discover to their dismay that their fate together is also tied to the resolution of the murder mystery.  This last plot twist provides an  additional and surprising kick at the end of the movie.

Sayles does a good job providing context for a small Texas town where the long-dominant Anglos are slowly being pushed out of the majority by a mushrooming Mexican-American population.  A small black population is caught in between the two larger groups.  The resulting frictions show up in politics, schools, and personal relationships.

This movie is very highly recommended both as a superbly-filmed murder mystery and as a dissection of a slice of American life over two generations in one Texas town.",1175904000,7,1863,5.012987012987013

I'm happy to say that I saw this film when it first came out at an artsy-fartsy theatre in Tucson, which means I first saw it on the Big Screen in a Small Theatre.

It was great then, and it's even better now.

This film has so many dimensions, and can be viewed from so many angles, that it's worthy of an entire semester of ""Film Study 101"" in its own right.  I couldn't even begin to describe the way it looks at things from a familial, ethnic, racial, social, political, historical, personal perspective, not to mention the wonderful mystery that it depicts, which, alas, being a mystery, can be sustained only for the first viewing.  But, once you get past the mystery, you can watch the film for all of its other wonderful qualities, not least of which are the cinematic techniques that Sayles employs (invented?), such as his panning flashbacks, which sustain the movie's plot.  Sayles is a Master,  at the top of his game.  And I haven't even mentioned the excellent cast and their performances.

I've viewed this film many times since I saw it the first time in Tucson.  (It's like listening to Beethoven's Ninth, or looking at Rembrandt's Night Watch.  Can you ever get enough?)

Believe me, I'm a movie lover, with very high standards, and this movie exceeds all of them.  I can't believe that any human being with a pulse in his or her veins would not give this Great Work of Art five stars -- no, ten stars.

812924,5,630422513X,"When someone asks me my favorite movie-- I work retail so it happens too much-- Lone Star always goes missing in my brain. After I watch it, though, it tops the list.

The reason is probably because it concerns a small town and an archaic mystery (as you will see in the film) and this does not jump out at you; that is, until you see it and are amazed at the story and the depth.

It hits three levels. First, the sociopolitical level: the background is a town with a history divided between blacks, whites, and Mexicans. The whites are losing the demographic battle and changes are occurring in education and the political hierarchy. All this in one town where the old guard--black, white, and Mexican--keep watch and excercise caution. The second level is historical. Every oldtimer in the town has a relationship with the other that remains under the table. There were few past scandals, riots, protests, save one incident: the murder of the sherrif Charlie Wade, the man who terrorized everyone he came into contact with. The story goes that he was a loose cannon, he dissappeared, and everyone looked the other way and never looked back. Real western cliche? Watch the movie. Enter the third aspect: as they say in espanyol, lo personal--the personal. All three elements mesh here. The basis is the discovery of Charlie Wade's remains, the introduction and unraveling tale of deputy sherrif Buddy Deeds (the man assumed to have killed Wade), and his son's dogged investigation. Buddy Deed's is a legend. We hear this over and over and get caught up in it. But then legendary sherrif's son comes home and seeks out the truth. Introspective-like. Slow-like. Western-like. I dunno, Chris Cooper does a helluva job. All other actors give top-notch performances. Elizabeth Penya especially deserves credit and I do not know why she has not been cast in similar roles.

But really it all begins with a mystery and that's what makes the movie great. In short, the movie in two hours that which most writers would have made into a miniseries. And it is done in western-style slow time.

813021,4,630422513X,"A perfect representation of the struggles that all people face, John Sayles' ""Lone Star"" balances differing views on gender, race, and the age gap between generations. Using a non-linear story line, Sayles is able to jump back and forth between several tense relationships and situations that are occurring in the same town with ease. ""Lone Star"" takes into account the issues that numerous characters face. The film takes into account the stereotypical struggle between mother and daughter and father and son on many generation levels. Not only does the movie touch on difficult familial problems, but within the confines of the family relationships the question of race and cultural backgrounds also come into play. Border crossings, interracial relationships, and prejudice in general provide most of the story line for the movie. Sayles provides his viewers with the opportunity to witness prejudices and the power of the human ability to overcome such barriers on many different levels. He presents his audience with many stereotypes. For example, there are black people who are in a bar and get into a gun fight, a police officer when makes generalizations about a Mexican man, and the divide between parents of different races on how their children should be educated and with what information they should be provided. The story of the movie is constructed around one central character and through the people that he meets and the relationships that he develops the story branches out to uncover several more stories that depict a similar struggle under a different veil. There is the story of an Army Colonel who is at odds with his father, his son, and in turn himself. Into this relationship falls the issue of being black and how each generation has had to face it differently. There is the story of a Mexican schoolteacher who is up against her all too assimilated mother and is also dealing with her son who doesn't care about his education. The woman's mother is also dealing with her own issues concerning border crossing and the issues of being a Hispanic woman in America. Finally there is the story of the town's white sheriff and his search to expose the real life of his father, a legend in the community, a man whom he did not get along with. There are dialogues in the film which represent the issues of race at hand. A black woman soldier refers to America as ""their country"" and a Mexican woman who takes pride in being an American is constantly reminding the workers in her Mexican restaurant to ""speak English"". In the end, love conquers all and people's ability to have sympathy and understand allows reconciliation and leaves the viewer with the sense that all will be ok for the characters.",1134259200,2,2719,4.900216919739696
813022,4,630422513X,"Lone Star is a complex movie that bases it's story line on a small town, Western, murder mystery.  The film exhibits excellent use of the camera, which allows the audience to get into the mind and confusion of the characters within the movie.  More importantly, though, it touches on serious subjects such as racism and interracial relationships.

The camera use is quite cunning, because it allows the audience to zoom in and out of the characters mind.  A good example of this is when Wade is ready to shoot Otis, and the camera changes its broadened focus on them to a closer focus of Hollis, enabling us to see his dilemma.

Another example of exemplary camera use is in the end, when we see Sam and Pilar sitting on the hood of the car under the old movie screen.  The angle of this scene creates a childish dimension of the two compared to the large movie screen.  Once the camera moves farther away we see them in a more size appropriate image.  At this point Pilar, says, ""To hell with history..."" and ""...forget the Alamo.""  They are no longer children who are incapable of making decisions they are adults now.  I think that this scene is much larger than it first suggests, that it is in relation to the racial struggles that occur throughout this movie.  Though they are lovers, they still have the same blood flowing through them.  This not only creates a bridge between a white man and a Hispanic woman, who are in love despite ancestral backgrounds, but a bridge between the other racial barriers that make up a large part of this movies story.  By the end of the movie we get a vision of morality.  The director unfolds the fact that if we to get past these barriers we must first forget our past differences, and only then may we begin to bridge the gap that has been broken by borders for so long.",1134259200,,1815,4.477203647416413
813023,5,630422513X,"I was very interested by this movie and had a hard time founding it. Well, I finally got it and here's my review. I had heard the name John Sayles but had never seen any of his movies. From watching this movie, I can tell that Sayles is a very talented director, and writer, but I can't say the same about editing. He directed, wrote, and edited this movie, which shows his talent. But, I'm sorry mr. Sayles, this is a fascinating movie but you should have edited a little better.

There just seemed to me that there were some scenes that weren't necessary to be in the movie. This movie is very complex and deals with many matters, unfortunately, at times it just dealed with too many at once.

The movie has superb acting notably by Chris Cooper, Kris Kristofferson, Matthew McConnaughey and Elizabeth Pena. The movie's about a skeleton found in texas. The skeleton has a sheriff badge too. It is examined and the identity of the body is revealed. Chris Cooper is a sheriff who needs help to go back back to the time his father was an officer/sheriff/etc... He needs to go back to find out what happened. The movie was fascinating as you can see. It also happened to cram in conflicts such as racism. The movie uses the past of the characters to reveal truly shocking and amazing moments. While the movie is so remarquable and fascinating, the editing does come into play at times. Sayles leaves in some unnecessary stuff, especially towards the end that delays the discovery made by the sheriff (Chris Cooper). Now, that just frustrated me. I wanted to know what happened but he delayed and went onto some other topic for 15 minutes.

But, every movie has faults, and since this movie is unheard of (66 reviews???) and unavailable like everywhere, well, I recommend all of you to get your mints on it and add it to your serious collection. (if it is) So, good job Mr. Sayles, and I appreciate all of the effort you put into this movie. People like that and not talentless people like Quentin Tarantino, are the ones that should be praised. Congratulations Mr. Sayles, what a remarquable movie you made!",1126137600,,2105,4.5782493368700266

The DVD is in ""anamorphic widescreen,"" a skinny ribbon format that cuts off about 25% of the screen on the top and 25% on the bottom, consequently deleting almost 50% of the onscreen action.

I've seen this film about 20 times on VHS where the quality is far superior to this very substandard DVD version, which incidentally also washes out those magnificent cinematic colors that Sayles habitually uses in his films. A very disappointing reproduction of this masterpiece of a film.",1124755200,7,655,4.589743589743589
813025,5,630422513X,"My wife and I revisited this movie last night after many years.  Many other reviewers here have captured the essence of the movie's complexity.  Even though we both have seen the movie before we were up late talking about it and kept talking about it the next morning.  To say it is ""adult"" is an insult to kids.  Granted some themes are inappropriate for young children but I can see a family viewing of the film yielding some rich and rewarding discussions.

We loved the movie for the way it juxtaposed the history of Texas with personal history and that it doesn't neatly package either into black and white cliches.  There are age old struggles dealing with fathers and sons, how races interact, and interesting insights on how the new societal fractures are not so much racial as economic and philosophical (some of the most hardline characters are Mexican).

And anyone living in a small town understands that under the veneer of local civility and business as usual are secrets both life-affirming and appalling.

Some here have commented on the ending and it is a shocker and can dim the movie for some.  It did for me until I decided to give it some thought (This movie gives the viewer a lot of things to chew on.  Unlike much of the mind candy that passes for film these days, this movie will stay with you.).  I realized that the ending stood for the complexity of the town itself.  Despite constant references to a certain bar being the only place that blacks felt comfortable congregating or to the Mexican view of history being different from that of Anglos, the town's residents crossed the barriers of race and class much more than the locals realized (or would even care to admit.)

This movie demands repeat viewings....doing so will give you many satisfying evenings.  One of the best movies that we have ever seen.",1119052800,2,1836,4.679127725856698

Although at times a little talky and preachy, the movie nonetheless is a potent vision of filmmaking.  Chris Cooper is brilliant as the sheriff confronted with the discovery of a skeleton felt to be about 40 years dead.  Sayles uses smoothly meshed flashback transitions to spin his tale of a corrupt sheriff (played with malicious fervor by Kris Kristofferson), and the honest deputy (Matthew McConaughey, very good in a small role) who vows to stop Kristofferson's corruption.  Ethnic values are intertwined in the tale of a lovely young schoolteacher (Elizabeth Pena in a well fleshed out performance) who was once Cooper's lover.  Cooper is also by the way, the son of McConaughey.  Also mixed in is the story of an African-American colonel (the marvelous Joe Morton) who comes home to confront the father who deserted him (Ron Canada, also very good).  Frances McDormand has a brilliant cameo as Cooper's disturbed ex-wife, Bunny.

LONE STAR is a movie with an involving mystery and a whole lot to say about a fast-changing multi-cultural society and the personalities at work in it.

Right up to its final memorable line.",1114992000,,671,4.605042016806722
813028,3,630422513X,"""Lone Star"" directed by John Sayles, is a very story oriented movie.  Every aspect of its theme, plot, abstract terms, actors, director, cinematic features, location, mood and final scene all play a role in the complete story line.  All these elements fit snugly into the story's puzzle in order to create its mystery and get across its purpose.

""Lone Star"" is a murder mystery story, which deals with race relations and bigotry.  Sam, a Texas sheriff, is trying to discover if his father killed a former sheriff.  Throughout his hunt for the truth, Sam is told many stories.  These stories show how one life can touch many others.  In addition, these stories emphasize the cultural diversity of the county.  In the end, Sam discovers the true killer, and why the truth is being kept a secret.  In so doing, he also finds himself.

All the characters in this story are abstract terms.  Especially Wade, the old sheriff, who represents the old view southern, white Americans had about others races.  Every character represents a portion of Texas culture.  Without this array of characters, the movie would just be another simple murder mystery.  However, it is what the characters represent that makes this movie stand out from the rest.

The actors themselves must have been chosen because of their racial background and previous acting experience.  The main characters had a great amount of previous acting experience.  For example, Sam, played by Chris Cooper, played in twenty movies before starring in ""Lone Star"".  These actors added a feeling of realism to the story, which John Sayles wrote and directed.

John Sayles is an amazing director.  He has the ability to both write and direct his movies.  Other directors have tried this, but they usually seem to be better in a single area.  John Sayles pulls both off with amazing grace.  His story has depth, discovery, action, mystery, and love.  His directing shows he had a vision when writing the story.  His ability could be due to his experiences in many different aspects of filmmaking.  Before ""Lone Star"", Sayles had been an actor, director, writer, editor, producer, and part of a production crew.  ""Lone Star"" is a great story.  However, a film needs a great story and great cinematic features, which Sayles supplies in a numerous amount.

Cinematic features are used to pull the audience into the film.  The camera movements are not pronounced, however the camera angles and rhythmic edits are very appropriate for the feeling the story is trying to portray.  Sayles uses these angles to show the power of Wade or the drama of Hollis.  For example, in the scene where Wade is about to shoot Otis, the camera continually switches views to close-ups of Hollis' face in order to show the dilemma he is facing.  The only spots in which camera movement was purposefully used, was when Sayles wanted to go into the past.  For example, for the story about Otis and Wade's first meeting, the camera moves off to where there are no actors and zooms in so that the information to the viewer is limited.  Also, the sound was very realistic.  When there is music in the background, the audience knows where it is coming from.  The scene where Wade is beating up Otis is the only place where that is not true.  In that scene, music is playing to such a degree that it blocks out the words spoken.  This is done in order to show the audience how physical the memory is.  All Otis could remember was the physical beating he took from Wade and the bar in which it took place.

""Lone Star"" was filmed on location at Eagle Pass, Texas.  This Texas location had been previously used in two other movies, ""Heart of the Sunset"" and ""Como agua para chocolate.""  The first movie is a western; the second one is a romance.  This seems interesting because ""Lone Star"" is a combination of both these genres and moods.

The mood of the film's story is summarized in the last scene.  Where the teacher, Pilar, says, ""To hell with history..."" and ""...forget the Alamo.""  She is telling the audience to let go of the past.  The past is in the past.  What matters is how a person conducts his or her future.

I liked the film, but I did not care for the ending.  I know it was trying to symbolize how we are all related.  However, the film could have done so without going into the taboo subject of marriage between a brother and a sister.  It just seems a little disgusting to me.  Other than that one area, the story was fantastic.  It provides everything a movie needs to be great.

I believe, out of all the aspects that make a great movie, Sayles and his visionary story are what make this movie work.  The other areas were little bonuses, which helped, but were not the cause of its success.  A movie can lose its integrity because of communication problems between the writer and director.  However, when the director is the writer, that problem no longer exists.  Some people say a picture is worth a thousand words.  Sayles creates a masterfully painted picture of society by writing and directing a fabulous story.",1112745600,7,5060,4.694760820045558
813110,5,630422513X,"After a failed marriage in another town, Sam Deeds has wandered back home to Rio County like a man staggering home after an accident at the crossroads. There, through the offices of old and conspiring acquaintances, he becomes the sheriff--the very position his father had once held. (For readers of Sophocles, this should sound familiar.) When the film opens, it is two years later. We see a wide stretch of desert and two men. One explores the desert floor with a metal detector and the other reads from a guidebook.  When the latter suddenly looks up from the book and then down at the ground, he spies a skull and skeleton only just projecting from the hard desert earth. They call the sheriff and he, in rather sad, short order, has a very dark suspicion of whose body that might once have been and of the man who might have put it there.  Sam believes it to be the body of Charley Wade, a former sheriff of Rio County, legendary for his evil; and Sam believes his father, the beloved Buddy Deeds, successor to Charley Wade, killed him. The rest of the film is the story of how Sam uncovers the truth, which forces him, in turn, to reflect on his personal history and the audience to reflect on history itself.

Sam's history doesn't occur in a vacuum--as do so many in the movies--but rather against a background of still other personal histories and a History that has drawn imaginary divisions between individuals and ethnic communities. We see fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, living and dead, rise in conflict over a land divided by color and language. The ethnic balance in Rio County is beginning to shift. Hispanics now outnumber Anglos, both of whom have always outnumbered the African-Americans. And there are those who are sore over the way things were and the way they might be. But the divisions are, in a certain and very real sense, imaginary.  If we watch carefully, we will see that lines of division, like borders, are clear and hard and definite only as they appear in books and on maps. In Rio County, there are, despite prejudices and suspicions to the contrary, a plethora of mixed couples--soldiers, lovers, politicians--all united in pursuit of some other, non-dividing reward--a sense of place, love or money and power. And when we see the school raging over what version of history to tell, it seems obvious that events are conspiring to tell another history and another truth. And it should be no surprise that each character will reveal a little something of that truth or its moral. The bartender, Otis, for example, reminds his son that there's no borderline between ""the good people and the bad people""; he tells his grandson that ""blood means only what you let it""; the history teacher, Pilar, tries to tell people at the committee meeting that the history over which they are arguing is an oversimplification; and an Indian at a souvenir stand tells Sam to be ""Careful where you go pokin'. Who knows what you'll find.""

Sam thought he wanted to know who was buried in the desert, but discovers that what counts came after. He has come upon some large and unexpected matter regarding his father, the legendary Buddy Deeds, about deceptive ethnic divides, about his childhood sweetheart, Pilar, and about his own misplaced professional ambitions.  In the final scene of the movie, Sam and Pilar, are seated on the hood of his car before the dilapidated screen of an old, abandoned drive-in. It is a good metaphor for the lessons, for the truth, they now both want to embrace. ""We start from scratch?"" says Pilar. ""History--the hell with it, right?...Forget the Alamo."" And so the sheriff-detective and the history teacher have both come to believe that we can go forward--but only if we abandon the fights over the past, only if we forget history, forget the Alamo.",1112745600,8,3809,4.763636363636364

813205,5,630422513X,"John Sayles is first and foremost, a writter and his screenplays are why his films are so compelling. Prior to his career as a director, actor, producer and screenwritter, John Sayles was a novelist and I became aqauinted with Sayles in 1977 when I read ""Union Dues"". Even then, Sayles possessed an uncanny ear for writting simple and elegant dialogue. Like Anton Chekhov, Sayles proves that a good writter is also a good listener. Sayle's dialogue has the ring of an everyday conversation, and is refreshingly free of the pretensions and historonics that many screenwritters fall prey to. Folks in Texas don't sit around diners chatting about the existential nature of reality. In ""Lone Star"" we are treated to John Sayle's best writting and  an ensemble of accomplished actors who appear to delighted to be working on a rare project of artistic substance.
 Chris Cooper's potrayal Sheriff Sam Deeds is compelling evidence of what a masterful actor can accomplish with a well written screenplay . A lesser screenwritter would have resorted to dialogue that fit Sam Deeds into the mold of a stereotypical screen cop. In Hollywood, the Sheriff Deeds role gets written as either a facist, a buffon, a flawed anti-hero, or the Sgt. Friday perfect role model. Chris Cooper's tender and heartbreaking conversations with Elizabeth Pena's character should be studied by students of film, as a rare moment when accomplished acting is supported by a well written screen play. Chris Cooper's triumph is that he authenticates his character by playing against the prevailing ""wisdom"" of who cops are. Over the years, Cooper has revelled in the challenge of playing roles which shatter stereotypes, like the closeted gay Ex-Marine father in ""American Beauty"", or the seriously demented but often charming orchid pirate, John LaRoche in ""Adaption"". I pray that Chris Cooper's new found success doesn't lead him away from his frequent collaborations with Sayles. Sayle's dialogue and Cooper's acting fit like a glove. Chris Cooper is an actor of astounding range and should be included among the great screen actors of this era.
The supporting cast of Kris Kristofferson, Francis McDormand and several Latino actors in secondary roles is impressive. Two actors merit special mention for their performances: Joe Morton is a long-time member of Sayles periodical ensemble of actors. His small role as Col. Delmore Payne is a painful reminder of how his prodigious talents are woefully under utilized. Morton a Tony Award winning stage actor appears to have been relegated to a character actor in supporting roles, since his astounding performance in another Sayle's movie ""Brother From Another Planet"". One hopes that a shrewd casting agent will realize  Morton's untapped potential as an actor. The other performance of note is Matthew McConaughey's portrayal Buddy Dees. McConaughey was once the toast of Hollywood; but currently appears to be deadlocked by his own indecision on whether he wants to be a movie star or an actor. McConaughey has made some bad career decisions and in ""Lone Star"" we learn that he is capable of great things, if he doesn't let his pretty face get in the way.
The byazantine plot line is complex and the fine details of it's twin story lines may be alternatively fascinating and frustrating, to the viewer. One line involves a cast of characters in present-day and the other involves a separate cast that involves events 30 years prior to the present. For an attentive viewer, the rewards are great as Sayles skillfully merges, weaves, blends and resolves the dual story lines by the final credits. Along the way the viewer is treated to more murder, treachery, corruption, greed and incest than a Greek tradgedy.
It's safe to say that John Sayles will remain an outsider and renegade in the eyes of Hollywood. Sayles emerged from the counter-culture and stays at the margins, by choice. Hollywood doesn't like left leaning directors like Sayles or Oliver Stone. The fact that Sayles doesn't even make dogmatic films doesn't seem to matter, Sayles is  ""one of them"" and it's unlikey that things will change. Oliver Stone for all of his huffing and puffing about the Establishment, still won an Oscar or two. Sayles is the better filmaker because he doesn't hammer the viewer with, overblown rhetoric, cartoonish characters and self-indulgent auteurism to make a politcal point. ""Lone Star"" managed tweak the establishment by being a favorite of critics who took the Academy to task for ignoring ""Lone Star."" Sayle's amazing legacy will be recoginzed with the passage of time. Perhaps when John Sayles is 85 years old and in an extended care nursing home, the Academy will finally wheel him out bestow a Lifetime Acheivement Award and soothe their guilt for never recognizing his artistry. I think Sayles would be more flattered by a National Book Award, if and when, he decides to write the Great American Novel.",1064102400,4,4927,5.079012345679012

The story involves Mexican, Anglo, African-American and Indian cultures and the problems these groups have while living near the Mexican Border.  In a culture where 19 out of 20 residents are Mexican, the Anglos are in the minority but still rule the powerful positions in the community namely politics, law enforcement, and business.  The African-American population is smaller than the Anglo population and this group faces discrimination and prejudice from the Mexicans and Anglos both.
The movie focuses on three stories with characters from each ethnic group and the issues that they are confronted with both within their cultures and also as their culture relates to the other cultures.  The characters experience prejudice and acceptance, love (sometimes forbidden) and hate, democracy and dictatorship, tragedy and triumph, and success and failure.  The relationships touch on family dynamics, romance, social and political aspects of the individuals in this film.  In addition to the movie's entertainment value, the hidden educational content was a pleasant addition.  I found it difficult to stay emotionally detached from the characters in this film and I was surprised to learn how their lives intertwined.
I think this movie was extremely well done and I think it has something to offer just about everyone.  Although I was disappointed in the way the movie ended, I truly enjoyed Lone Star and I would give it a four out of five star rating.  This is an excellent movie that I would recommend to anyone.",1044230400,6,1694,5.153284671532846

I can't say about enough about John Sayles or the cast, especially the horribly underappreciated Chris Cooper in the lead role.  I only wish that the DVD included commentary from both director and cast.  Still, it's worth owning, and worth watching many times.",1041552000,7,518,4.733333333333333

Unlike Altman, however, he utilizes flashbacks exceptionally effectively, and adds a moral dimension to his films that you don't find elsewhere. With Sayles, there are no easy answers to complex moral questions, which is one reason his films are so rich.

813210,4,630422513X,"If you are looking for an action flick or suspense thriller, look elsewhere, this movie will disappoint you.  Fans of overdone, unrealistic, nearly plotless action movies (such as the John Woo action movies ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Mission Impossible II"") will probably be severely disappointed by Lone Star.
However, if you find overdone action movies like ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Mission Impossible II"" to be contrived, formulaic, and shallow, to the point of being boring, you will love this movie.  You must be comfortable with a slower movie pace to appreciate the masterful plot and character development in this movie.  For example, if you enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption (I loved it, though it was long and slow at times), you will also love this movie.
The plot, setting, etc. are probably less relevant than simply asking yourself what type of movie you enjoy.  An action-film lover could easily give Lone Star a one star review, while a filmgoer who doesn't need a lot of action will surely love this movie, and give it an enthusiastic five star review.
Final caution:  If you have children younger than teenagers, don't watch this as a family or the children will likely be very bored.  There's no really objectionable content, but the kids will not follow the movie well enough and will get bored.",1028419200,,1302,4.9495412844036695

This subtle allegory of the History of the United States features, in the same movie, the fights of the minorities and thoughts about the legendary icons that made the U.S.A.
If the screenplay of LONE STAR is complex and superb, one also appreciates the performances of Chris Cooper as a wry and disenchanted sherif and Frances McDormand as Cooper's neurotic ex-wife. Their performances alone should justify your investment.

813212,5,630422513X,"First I would like to thank John Sayles for his unique style.
A somewhat sleepy Southwest Texas border town provides the backdrop for this most unusual film. There is nothing uncommon about the demographic mix here: Anglo, Hispanic, Mexican, Black, yet Sayles hand creates an unforgettable experience through the use of warts-and-all character development and beautiful insight.
I realize some may have issues with the regional nature of this film but make no mistake, having lived most of my life in the Southwest, I can name actual persons that closely match each character in this film.
Chris Cooper plays the part of Sam Deeds to perfection. Recently divorced, Chris returns to Rio County as its new Sheriff, following in his legendary fathers' footsteps. As Chris states in the film, 'I spent the first 15 years of my life trying to be just like my old man, and the next 15 trying to kill him'. For those who do not have larger-than-life fathers, Cooper's portrail is a direct hit. For those who do, I need not say anything.
Although the plot revolves around the discovery of the remains of long-dead Sheriff Charlie Wade, this film is about conviction and human frailty, not solving a murder. An example of the wisdom of Sayles is when Otis Payne, bar owner, explains to his black-and-white thinking Colonel son Chet Payne, poignantly played by Eddie Robinson that most blacks in Rio County patronize both his bar and the church. And Sayles holds true to these words. With the exception of Charlie Wade's character, each shares strengths and weaknesses, frailty and prejudice, practicality and remorse.
Sam Deeds and Elizabeth Pena as Pilar Cruz fit together wonderfully as high-school sweethearts who are reunited after Sam's divorce. Convictions play heavily into both characters: Sam's ambivalent feelings toward his fathers' graft and political gain, Pilar's fight against a canned school curriculum. Sayles wisely points out that people of conviction are not perfect but are special. And when two special meet and fall in love, it is for a lifetime. Circumstances are not on their side, which makes their love affair that much more poignant. The few moments they are able to share are full of deep emotion and affection, just as they should be.",1018137600,40,2255,5.016
813213,5,630422513X,"Whatever the reasons are that John Sayles has managed to elude the attention of the mainstream entertainment media, he has had no trouble developing and mastering his craft. Lone Star is quite possibly his finest accomplishment thus far ...and is as well-executed and thought-out as any movie I have ever seen. The subtlety employed in the style and in the performances keeps the emotional maelstorm just slighly under the reins; Sayles' style is about provoking ideas in the viewer, not about spelling things out for the lowest common denominator.
This film demonstrates its superior quality in every important filmic element: acting, direction, cinematography, dialogue, and plot. The actors are honest and real, and have an excellent grasp on how to deal tastefully with mystery and taboo. The direction is smooth and seamless (check out the scene where the camera pans from the contemporary scene in a Mexican border town to a historical scene invloving Eladio Cruz on the other side of the border). The cinematography is beautiful (I always thought that it was done by Haskell Wexler - the greatest ever - but recently learned that it was Stuart Dryburgh.. Wexler has filmed other Sayles films, including Matewan and Limbo), offering a version of border-country Texas that both illustrates and conflicts with the insiduous, corrupt reality. The dialogue is simple and elusive, and tends to talk ""around the point,"" leaving the true meaning to be dealt with by other cinematic means. The plot is complicated yet not difficult to follow, and reveals information only as it is needed, creating an aura of suspense and mystery not known in the cinematic world since Coppola of the 70's. Like the Godfather films, Lone Star is ultimately a movie about familial relationships.
As far as love stories go, the one included in this film is one of the most painful and beautiful I have ever seen.
This movie is flawless.",1015891200,4,1915,5.044164037854889

As Sam moves between the Hispanic, White, and Black communities in Rio County, we see how members of each group feel that their ethic group is different and separate from the others.  However, in the end, the movie shows us how we are all pretty much the same and the degree that our lives are intertwined.  (Look for a scene in an African-American bar where a record is playing on a jukebox.  Later, virtually the same record, this time sung in Spanish, is played on the jukebox in a Mexican restaurant.)

(Although sometimes it is, even when you least expect it.) This movie is also clever to point out that many people continue to live lives filled with lies rather than give up the comfort and security in finding out the facts.  The evidence for this movie is found in reality. Pay close attention to the many symbols, from ""Charlie,"" to ""Buddy Deeds,"" to a flag or even a Colt 45.

Each character must face everything all that they ""see or seem"" when the skeleton of former county sheriff, Charley Wade, is unearthed. Present sheriff Sam Deeds sets out the mission to find out what the truth is behind a local legend.  Sam's father Buddy Deeds, Rio County hero, is the main suspect.

Her mother Merceedes, who is prejudice against her own heritage.  Otis and Mayor Hollis who would prefer to keep the legend alive, and forget the past.
The small town culture lends to the intertwining storylines.  Cultural and racial divisions cause Rio County citizens to coexist with an underlying tension.  Their viewpoints on what happened in the past affects their present day lives.  Also, the races divide: Otis's bar is a ""haven"" for the African-Americans, Hispancis battle with whites over the majority rule.  All groups coexist under the small town politics.  This is most evident in the Marshall law of Charley Wade and Buddy Deeds favor system. In the end, what the audience, and the characters, are led to believe is true, is shown to be another, convoluted reality affecting their relationships.",1001548800,2,1507,4.940476190476191
813269,5,630422513X,"Charlie Wade (Kris Kristofferson) was a corrupt, evil Sheriff of Rio County, Texas in the 1950s. When he disappears one night, along with $10,000, the community is only too happy to accept his Deputy Buddy Deeds (Matthew McConaughey) as the new Sheriff. Buddy is a legend. Almost the entire community loved, and still reveres, Buddy Deeds. While Charlie Wade antagonized the black and Mexican members of the County, Buddy Deeds kept peace and harmony.
Years later, when Charlie Wade's long-dead body is found in the desert,the new Sheriff, Buddy's son Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper), must find out what happened.
While Sam Deeds is trying to solve the old crime, he is also trying to come to terms with his father's legacy and reunite with his old girlfriend Pilar Cruz (Elizabeth Pena).
Director John Sayles intertwines the stories of the Cruz family, the Deeds family and the Payne family.
The very interesting thing about this movie is that most of the problems revolve around fathers. Pilar Cruz, Sam Deeds and Delmore Payne's (Joe Morton)lives are all very much influenced by how they perceive their fathers.
Sayles uses music and flashbacks to enhance and explain the story, and he uses them both extremely well. He uses the music to set the scene, and it is never overbearing.
All of the acting is terrific, especially Joe Morton as Delmore Payne. An incredibly important part of the movie is the location. Very close to the border, Rio is home to many different cultures. Sometimes these cultures do not co-exist peacefully. This was especially a problem during Charlie Wade's time as Sheriff. There is conflict in the schools about the teachers teaching Texas history from the Mexican perspective, and there is only one bar in town for the black residents to visit.

I knew this was a Sayles film because no one else can entwine history, sociology and entertainment in one gulp.(Watch a 25-year-old film entitled, I believe, ""Alligator,'' _ a horror movie that Sayles wrote for someone else and his talent jumps out even in a potboiler.)
Yes, Chris Cooper and the rest of the cast is marvelous. But put this cast and this plot in the hands of another writer and director and you get pap. Sayles is writing more than the history of one small Texas town. He's writing the history of this country _ its ethnic tensions, its corruption, its politics.

It's about a black army colonel who is posted to command a closing base near his estranged father's nightclub.  It's about his father and his son.  It's about a small town on the border between the US and Mexico, and it's about the borderlands between history and legend, between fact and truth, between love and enmity.

When a skeleton found in the desert turns out to be Sheriff Charlie Wade who was murdered thirty years before, the current sheriff, Sam Deeds sets out to solve the mystery.  What follows is a complex human drama, with intertwining stories that ultimately reveal some startling truths.
To best tell this tale, John Sayles uses a series of flashbacks artfully woven into the modern story, which enhance the viewer's understanding of the internal and external forces which have shaped the people of the town.  We see the racism, the corruption, the romantic relationships and tread the thin line between right and wrong.  We are constantly led through a series multi-layered series of interpretations.
Chris Cooper plays the role of the current sheriff with amazing understatement.  He struggles with the thought that it was his own father, now deceased,  who was the murderer. Elizabeth Pena plays his Mexican-American former childhood sweetheart with a sensuous sadness.  Ron Canada plays the African American owner of a roadhouse with wisdom and insight.

It is certainly one of the best films Sayles has yet given us.  The story is richly textured and wonderfully complex in it's characters, it's social  themes and it's who-done-it mystery.
This film covers a potpourri of  subjects: racial strife, national identity, interfamily relationships,  political corruption and political correctness, among others.  That Sayles  is able to contain all these tumultuous matters in one film and make them  work naturally within the structure of that film is nothing short of  miraculuous.
The performances are uniformly excellent, with Chris Cooper  and Elizabeth Pena standouts as former high school sweethearts who were  torn apart by their parents. The reason for their separation is not what it  at first seems to be and it is one of the ""kickers"" of this  movie.  Francis McDormand is featured as Cooper's bipolar ex-wife in a  wonderful cameo.  McConaughey is fine in flashbacks as Cooper's legendary  lawman father.  Kristofferson is all snake venom as a corrupt and murderous  sheriff. Joe Morton is properly reserved as the commander of a local  military installation, a man who has worked his way up in a formally  structured institution, coming to terms with his estranged father, a former  numbers runner and gambler who is now the owner of the only local bar that  caters to the Afican American community.

7865207,5,630422513X,"Some say the new class divide is not economic but educational. Maybe. If it is the case that the stupid and the ignorant and the ill educated - some of them in very high places - would not see, let alone get this movie, then that is a shame. That is because these are the very people that should see this movie because it helps one to understand what it is like to be a migrant, to be black in a county or country controlled by whites, to be a woman or younger female in a county or country controlled by men. There is a mystical power created by Director Sayles around the ""legend"" of Buddy Deeds and the goings on in Rio County. Plenty of other reviews cover the plot etc. Amongst America's greatest films to explore race and migration. Brilliant.",1515715200,,749,4.28169014084507
