8412482,5,B0040ZK920,"The Devil's Hand  was made during the German occupation of France. Unlike H.G. Clouzot's ""The Crow"" (which was also made by Continental Films and also starred Pierre Fresnay) this fantastic, disturbing and visually stunning horror film is practically unheard of. It's too bad, because this should be ranked up there with the great classic horror films. It's a Faustian tale about selling your soul to the devil; except in this case you get the devil's hand, in a box. Once all your wishes are granted, (fame, money, the hot girl)  really bad things happen. (It could be a thinly veiled parable of how the Vichy government was created). It was directed by Maurice Tourneur, a well-known silent film director and the father of Jacques Tourneur, director of Cat People, I Walked With a Zombie, Out of the Past  and  Curse of the Demon (to name a few of his best). If you have seen Bertrand Tavernier's  brilliant film ""Safe Conduct"" about the French film business during the Occupation, he actually shows them working on The Devil's Hand.  This is a very rare film that is a must have for any collector. Where is Criterion when you need them?",1512604800,,1139,4.7272727272727275

8412484,5,B0040ZK920,"I'm not commenting on the MOVIE not the DVD. I got a vhs copy of this movie called ""the devil's left hand"" years ago but the dubbing was so bad
it was hard to watch this incredible classic so I then got a import copy with subtitles and remastered quality and it's great! This is a classic
horror fans foreign film dream. A must have! a poor artist buys a hand which turns out to be the devil's hand and receives fame and fortune
beyond his wildest dreams but it turns into a nightmare when the devil shows up to collect his due! This French made movie is one of the
best horror/mystery/devil type movies I have in my collection and a must have for all fans of classic horror. I'm not a big fan of subtitle films
but this is a must have. It has the dubbed version but the quality is not as good and the dubbing is hard to follow. You can get copies of this
to play on your American dvd player from other collectors in US since there is no American version of this DVD available. GET IT now!",1437264000,2,989,4.103092783505154
