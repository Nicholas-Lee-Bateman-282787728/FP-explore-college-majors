8603712,4,B00EC6VJD0,"This show is eccentric, but also a pretty good show. The first time I watched it, I didn't quite understand it either. The second time I saw it kinda started to grow on me, and I started to understand it better. The dark headed girl travels from book to book, to find Hatsumi. On a scale of 1 to10, this is a 6 1/2.",1479340800,,315,3.9375
8603713,1,B00EC6VJD0,"first: it would not even work in my Ps3, Ps4 and my DVD player. I got it working on PC that was the only way to watch it. the Story was all over the place trying to focus on 2 people.it was jarring when the story would whip around between the two. it skip esp., only to revisit after the story was finish. You know this as it ends she rethinks of her story (I know they do this for how it was on TV in japan but in DVD there is no reason to do so.)  . The ""bad guy"" had a better ending! I know this happens from time to time but this anime did not earn it.",1461974400,2,556,3.6333333333333333
