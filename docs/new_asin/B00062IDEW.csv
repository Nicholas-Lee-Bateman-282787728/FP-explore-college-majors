These have been a fixture for some time. If there was not a demand for subtitles they wouls not be provided. Obviously the producers of this very inferior set are not interested in selling a second series. I alas am barred from buying further outputs as I could not follow at least half of the diologue

2161683,5,B00062IDEW,"Last summer (2004) I had the oppertunity to watch to me one of the greatest new shows of all time, The ""4400"",. At first I didn't know if it was a movie, mini series or a tv series but all I knew was that I had to watch it and man was I ever entertained. After the last episode, I was hoping it would return as a dvd and another seasen. Well next summer it will and the dvd is out and I had to buy it and I did.

The show is about 4400 who have been missing for around half a cenary all of a sudden appear un aged and have no memory of what happened as if nothing strange happened to them. No one knows where have they been or who took them but all they know is each one of them has a special power.

The dvd comes in 2 discs, with 2 episodes on one and 3 on the other. There aren't special features (comentary, behinds the scenes. etc) but the dvd is still great since I can see the first season anytime I want

The show was like a combination of the X Files and X- Men. It has a lot of action, romance and maybe some comedy in it.",1104710400,8,1032,3.7685185185185186
2161684,2,B00062IDEW,"The Plot is not bad, and they did give it a decent Production Value (there is a Scully/Mulder feel to it).

It's just that, it drags on AND ON. The entire consitution of this ""season"", is the 4400 (people/returnees) going about their lives, with the occassional paranormal phenomena to fill the void with some substance. No explanations ever, and hardly anything comes to fruition for the viewer. You just sit there and wonder.

The whole premise of the show would have been constantly asking the question; ""what is their purpose and why have they come home after all this time?"" They do develop weird capabilities, and don't know what's happening to them, so you get the idea. It goes on and on (nothing real important), then something weird happens, then pointless drama for another 15 to 20 minutes.

I didn't really get anything out of this series. And I'm really puzzled why people love it so much. But hey? Maybe you'll love it too, just be warned: DRAMA CENTRAL, with a splash of sci-fi for garnish.

Lastly, as a ""Season"", I would expect more than five episodes, this is a Mini-series.",1104278400,17,1093,4.706806282722513
2161685,5,B00062IDEW,"Over the last century people from all around the world have been abducted never to be heard from again...until now.

A comet rushes toward the Earth, unable to stop it with ICBM nuclear weapons the people of Earth brace themselves for the end. Incredibly the comet delivers 4400 abductees from the last century. Clad in the clothes they wore on the days they were abducted the 4400 people have no idea where they have been and how they have arrived. A federal team are assigned to investigate the 4400 when one of them commits a murder, as the story unravels and the 4400 adapt to the 21st Century they begin to discover they have been gifted with powerful abilities, some of these powers are destructive, others can give life. As the series progresses every plot and sub plot is beautifully executed and tied up nicely to leave the audience on the edge of their seat. The casting is excellent, the stories are moving and the action is consistent. Why are the 4400 back, why here, why now and who gave them these amazing powers, aliens? Maybe, maybe not!...you'll have to watch it.

Scott Peters, The Outer Limits to his credit has created a cutting edge series with characters easily warmed too and a host of different stories that all tie in perfectly. The new series should be with us around June 2005 in the US and probably a little later in the UK. Would appreciate an international release though...please! Regardless of if you are a Sci-Fi fan or not, you will love 'The 4400', watch it now so when your friends are talking about it you know what to say...

2161686,5,B00062IDEW,"We go this series as a two-part mini-series here in Australia.

Over the past years 4400 people have disappeared and then one night they are returned unharmed. A group of investigators are sent to track them as they return to life. It follows stories of a handfull of the abductees including a young wife and mother who discovers her husband has re-married, she becomes close to another 4400 person who was in love with her grandmother. It also follows a man who has increased reactions and sets about cleaning up his neighbourhood.

The investigators discover that they have all been chosen for a reason and all have a purpose, this is confirmed when it is revealed that the 4400 weren't abducted by aliens - but by future humans on Earth whose race is dying out.

A great involving series with interesting stories and just the right about of 'personal involvement'.

If you like series like Sliders, Stargate SG1 etc then you should enjoy this. I recommend it 100%. Look out for Season 2 which has been confirmed!",1101686400,13,1015,4.7175141242937855
2161687,5,B00062IDEW,"I caught this ""event series"" when it first aired on the USA Network and was hooked from the first episode.  Don't let the sci-fi/X-files slant deter you from watching this series because it is so much more.  It's part police procedural, part family drama, part sci-fi, and the mix of elements is perfect.  The two main characters, Homeland Security agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris (played exceptionally well by Joel Gretch of ""Taken"" and Jacqueline McKenzie), form the emotional center of the show and must confront their own issues with the 4400 returnees.  Between episodes 1 and 5 you're treated to some very emotional, very dramatic, classic sci-fi storytelling; and by the time you get to the episode 6 revelation, you're chomping at the bit for more.  This was one heck of a good series and an example of how dramatic and emotional good science fiction can be.",1101427200,3,871,4.858108108108108
2161688,5,B00062IDEW,"4,400 people who disappeared over the last 60 years are returned to earth all at once, and they are the same age as when they were abducted. The returnees have no memory of what happened while they were gone, and some demonstrate supernatural powers that they didn't have before they left.

Two federal agents, Tom and Diana, are assigned to investigate. Tom's nephew is one of the returnees who has been missing for three years.  Diana develops a relationship with a now parentless child who was abducted several decades ago.  The writers do a nice job of combining threads that continue from episode to episode with the new situations that arise.  This show has been described as ""X-Files meet X-Men"".  Recommended for sci-fi or fantasy fans.

I hunted around the internet for some information about the DVD.  I found [...] which says that the Pilot and four episodes is included on the DVD set.  The artwork doesn't mention any extras, which is disappointing if that is the case.

1. Pilot (2 hour movie):  What scientists believe is a comet is actually a ball of light that leaves behind 4400 missing persons.  The 4400 are quarantined and finally released.
2. The New & Improved Carl Morrissey:  One of the 4400 becomes a vigilante trying to clean up the crime in his neighborhood.
3. Becoming:  An M.O. used in a homicide is the same as the M.O. of a serial killer from 25 years ago.  As the public turns hostile toward the 4400, one returnee, Jordan, decides to organize.
4. Trial By Fire:  When a reporter makes the names of the 4400 public, the returnees are targeted by fire-bombers.  Jordan tries to provide shelter for his fellow returnees.
5. White Light:  The federal agents make a discovery about what had really happened to the 4400.

It's been a while since an episode aired, and I had some question about its future status. I've read that Season 2 has been ordered and will have 13 episodes starting in June 2005.",1100995200,269,1931,4.679525222551929
2161689,5,B00062IDEW,I second that. If you're a fan of X-files or Taken you'll love this series. Too bad it was so short! Let's hope the second season will be as good as the first.,1099008000,3,159,3.8484848484848486
2161690,5,B00062IDEW,"I caught this mini-series on USA during a marathon leading up to the season finale. It was fantastic to be able to watch the series from start to finish all in one sitting (although six hours of TV watching on one Sunday definitely qualifies me as a couch potato -- at least that day!)

I fell in love with this series and can't wait to buy or rent it to watch it again! The USA message boards on this show were going like crazy after the season finale. It was originally only supposed to be a miniseries, but it got such a huge response from the public that they are producing a second season -- which I can't wait for. I hear it's supposed to air in March 2005 (?).

I highly recommend The 4400 first season to anyone who enjoyed X-Files or Taken. They're not all exactly in the same vein, but enjoyable on the same level nonetheless, particularly if you enjoy sci-fi/aliens/UFOs genre-type stuff.

I highly recommend this series.",1098403200,10,932,4.43859649122807

2161744,5,B00062IDEW,"What a great show. I and the wife loved it. The premiss is science fiction, 4400 people who were abducted throughout time going back to the 1940's all return at the same time exactly as they left,  in a ball of light. What happens next is great story telling. How do they adjust, what happened to them. What's going to happen to them. What does the world do, our government? Are they a threat or are they friendlies. How will they live, where will they live? All of these questions and more are answered over the 4 seasons that this series ran and it all begins with this first season. My only complaint is that this first season is only about 5 episodes.

2161748,5,B00062IDEW,It is too bad that I did not start watching 4400 sooner.  Now I have worked my way up to season 3.  The story line is original.

These people were given certain abilities to help the human race avert an upcoming disaster.,1382227200,,371,4.111111111111111
2161749,4,B00062IDEW,"i don't like this quite as much as the x-files but compared to some of the shows doing scifi in 2013, this is still very good. there are 4400 people abducted over a sixty year period. in the 21st century they are returned. the dept of homeland security puts them into quarantine but can find nothing abnormal about them other than they are the age when they were abducted. some of them have some special abilities which gradually appear. we follow two agents and various members of the 4400. some of these members are more interesting than others as well as their story arcs. but all in all it is pretty interesting viewing. i particularly enjoyed the young man with healing powers, the young girl with esp, the baby with powers while in utero. the two agents aren't bad but they are no scully and mulder from x-files. there is also no humor like there was in x-files.

2161775,5,B00062IDEW,"The 4400 was one of my favorite sci-fi shows. After 6 years, it still pains me to reflect back on its cancellation after only 4 seasons.  I'm convinced it happened because of the lack of advertising and the impact of the infamous writers' strike.

...so why do I love this show? Where do I begin?!
1. I love movies and well-made TV shows about people with super abilities (i.e Alphas and Smallville). The 4400 has go it.
2. I was a fan of the X-Files show because of the good main character partnering and the mysterious investigative edge. The 4400 has got that too.
3. I was a fan of the show 24 because of surprise twists and the fast story progression.  Guess what?...  the 4400 has got it too.
4. I'm a fan of shows with superb writers, like Lost.  Most importantly, the 4400 has got it.

I could go on but I would need a soap box.  The only negative is Season 1 is way too short.  There is movie-length Pilot and just 4 other episodes.",1370649600,,941,4.247191011235955

2161810,5,B00062IDEW,"People and lights in the sky. We have all heard the stories and we have witnessed people telling us that something were out there. But what if there was and we were  being ignorant in our understanding? All at once 4400 people appear in the middle of nowhere, with no memory of where they have been. What's more, the people have not aged and seem to be exactly the same as they were. Well, they do until they are looked at. Then there is the man and his anger, the little girl who sees, the A-American gentleman who dated a woman named Lily who just so happens to have a granddaughter amongst these people, and an agent with a boy that has been in a coma for a long, long time.

When this story began, I thought it had a great taste to it. i had missed out on the previous viewings and i bought the DVD and, well, it has the shows on it and not much else. It has 5 episodes in all, including the Pilot, and a lot of things happen. important things. One I like a lot was the idea not to quarantine the people. As one person noted, ""if they are as danger as you say, what good would putting them in one place be?"" There's more.

The acting here is superb and has some veteran talents. I liked seeing a cold man turned good guy from The Taken series here, because she showed me what EBE could mean with him in it. The kids selected are great, especially the young girl, and the delivery of new information is wonderful. I see threads slinking out and allowing a person to know a million things and yet not grasp it all, making me think of Dark Skies and FlashForward seeing a linked grandfather. It was beautiful, and I loved it.

The world here is big for the words I am giving but spoiling a lot would be sinister. I just want you to watch because it has such a pull and, really, I was a late person to it as well. a 5/5 here, no doubt, even though the Pilot was restrained by budget and some green screen is noticed.

a passing note - you might want to look into a combined set if you really want it all. They are a good coinage and you might want to compare before doing anything.

It kicks aside the small stuff. I hope I helped.",1304035200,,2131,4.09832134292566
2161811,4,B00062IDEW,"All I had to hear about The 4400 to become interested were the names Rene Echevarria, Robert Hewitt Wolfe and Ira Steven Behr: three of the key writers of Deep Space Nine. The five episodes here introduce the premise (that 4400 people were abducted over a period of about 60 years and all returned en masse without having aged a day since their disappearances). Along the way, we're privy to some interesting social commentary--this was at the height of the Bush administration, the PATRIOTAct, etc.--and story arcs that immediately began to evolve and sprawl before our eyes (something that we DS9 fans found quite familiar). These first five episodes are structured more like a mini-series (which is all the show was at the time of production) and gorging is easily the way to go here.

As for the DVD release, Paramount gave us no extra content at all; not even a promo ad for the series. Each episode opens with a recap of previous plot threads, which may have made sense for weekly, over-the-air broadcast but is extraneous on DVD. Shaving off these four recaps would probably have reduced the entire season to just over four hours and one wonders why Paramount didn't just go that route and fit all five episodes on one disc. At least they didn't present it as a flipper disc!",1295740800,,1282,4.697777777777778

Cinematically, this show is very pleasing to watch and I love the performances of Jac. McKenzie and Patrick Flueger.

A top show, 10/10 for this season.",1251504000,,348,4.507936507936508
2161813,4,B00062IDEW,"TV goes in cycles -- and a few years ago, there were a lot of creepy-suspenseful shows full of strange supernatural/superhuman occurrances, sort of crosses between ""X-Files"" and ""Lost."" But before those shows came out, there was the most underrated one: ""The 4400,"" a suspenseful, intelligent show that looks not at mysterious abductions -- but mysterious returns.

1946: A little girl vanishes in the woods. 1951: A black GI vanishes from a tent. 1979: A corporate head vanishes from his car. 2001: A teenager vanishes from a camping trip, leaving his cousin in a coma. In 2004, a comet is on a collision course with Earth, causing widespread panic. But instead of crashing, it hovers over a Seattle lake -- and leaves 4400 bewildered people around the lakeside.

These people all vanished over the past sixty years, and have been returned without any aging, and with no memory of what happened to them in the time they were gone. Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch), whose son is the one in a coma, is desperate to find out what did happen, so he rejoins Homeland Security to keep tabs on the ""4400,"" as they are now known.

Some like his nephew Shawn (Patrick Flueger) return to their old lives, only to find that they are reviled. And some like ex-GI Richard (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) and his girlfriend's granddaughter Lily (Laura Allen) find that they have no lives to return to. Ostracized and threatened, they start to draw together. But the strangest thing is that the 4400 are starting to show signs of X-Men-like powers: super speed, clairvoyance, telekinesis, healing, and mind control.

Tom and his HS partner Diana Skouros (Jacqueline McKenzie) track down both rogue abductees, and try to prevent harm from coming to the innocent 4400s. But when Shawn heals Tom's son Kyle (Chad Faust), Kyle comes back changed -- and his strange behavior holds the key to the 4400's purpose on Earth.

Okay, the complete first season of ""4400"" is only five episodes long, making it about the length of a miniseries. But unlike most shows on TV, its writers cram a whole season's worth of plot into only six hours. In most movies and shows, people who vanish and then are returned are always welcomed back. This time, they are treated with suspicion and even hatred, and many are completely alone.

There are standalone ""4400 of the week"" stories, like the one about a 4400 serial killer, or a vigilante who is using his powers. But there are also intertwining plots about how the 4400s try to survive in a new world that fears them. We see Shawn trying to fit back into high school, and Richard and Lily finding that they have no homes left, and building a home together.

And the final episode is absolutely mind-blowing, with sudden shifts in Homeland Security's power, a sinister megamogul, and Tom desperately trying to save his son. While the mystery of the 4400s is partly solved, there are lots of questions left over for the recently released second season. It's satisfying, but will leave you wanting more.

The acting is kind of stiff in the first episode or two, but when the actors settle into their roles they do a solid job. Gretsch and McKenzie have good-cop/bad-cop chemistry, and they do a good job playing off each other's personalities. Flueger soon does a good job as a a tormented teenager, and Ali is nothing short of brilliant with his confused, bittersweet Richard. The one real problem is Conchita Campbell, who spends most of the season playing the Smiling Little Kid Who Makes Creepy Pronouncements.

""The 4400"" produced a rather peculiar brand of paranormal show, with a new spin on the typical ""abducted by aliens"" plot. Suspenseful, smart and well-written, this is one to keep an eye on.",1243123200,,3705,4.812893081761007

2161835,3,B00062IDEW,"At this point in the series, ""The 4400"" isn't a great show.  It's a good show that, for the most part, will keep you entertained.  It's a quick season, so the overall story arc gets handled nicely.  It's a very intimate show, and the character's are introduced quickly and skillfully, but there are a few things lacking in the overall package that really prevent it from being at the same level as other sci-fi mysteries like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0017HZZP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica/dp/B000AJJNFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica</a>.  I'll break the show up into a list of positives and negatives.

POSITIVES
+ The ""mystery of the week"" sections of the episodes are a lot stronger than the overall arc of the season.  Each episode told a good standalone story, and that is the driving force behind this being a good show.
+ A lot of the guest stars are very, very impressive.  Especially David Eigenberg is episode two as Carl Morrisey.
+ The characters are interesting, for the most part.  I especially enjoyed Lily and Richard.
+ The directing is, to say the least, always experimental.  There are some shots that are so innovative and work really well, but however it also gets to the point where some of the more experimental camera work is a bit jarring.

NEGATIVES
- The acting, by and large, ranges from mediocre to bad.  While all of the actors do have moments that convince me that there might be a sparkle of talent in there, a lot of the leads are pretty much bad.  Patrick Flueger as Shawn is simply awful, as is Brooke Nevin as Nikki.  None of the cast members steadily impressed me other than Billy Campbell as Jordan and Conchita Campbell as Maia.
- The music in the series is very badly picked out.  When they should have used scores, they use cheesy pop culture songs that, while the songs are good by themselves, they sound highly out of place in the show.
- The writers seem to be fans of taking the easy way out with character interactions.  Subtlety is completely disregarded for sweeping gestures.  Romance never develops, it explodes into being.  Conflict never simmers before boiling, it always arrives already steaming.

While this short season (five episodes in total) is extremely flawed, it's also entertaining television.  It's not at the level where it's a guilty pleasure, because a lot of aspects of it still make it a good show, but the acting, writing, and use of music needs to improve a considerable amount before this can be a show that I can truly appreciate.

2161838,4,B00062IDEW,"Well written, well acted. Basically, 4400 abductees return in a ball of light, each with a special ability. The central tale revolves around a core group but each week there is a guest ability featured. There are many organizations trying to use the 4400 to its own ends so we have villains from government, industry and family all trying to take advantage of the talents demonstrated by the returnees. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's good and who's bad (and even who's dead and who's alive).

This show draws from many sources but still manages to be unique and stand on its own. It has a bit of the Andromeda Strain, H.G. Wells, Biblical figures, but mostly Dr. Seuss's ""The Sneetches"". (The star bellied Sneetches had bellies with stars; the plain bellied Sneetches had none upon thar's""). That's basically the whole premise - Do you want a star or not? Is having a star better than not? This may sound simplistic but the writers weave episode after episode, season after season's stories around this age old question - Is what we want really best for us?

2161841,4,B00062IDEW,"the 4400 series began around the same time the X-Files series ended, and became, to me, the heir apparent in terms of quality sci-fi on television.  You have a male-female partnership (like the X-Files); you have unexplained sci-fi stories that they investigate (like the X-Files).  The show is even filmed in the Vancouver, Canada area, (like the X-Files). The comparisons end there.  Everything else about the two shows is quite different- from the overall tone of the show, to the acting, the chemistry between all the actors.  Any yet, the 4400 (like the X-Files) serves up quality and interesting sci-fi stories episode after episode.  To me, it's like the 4400 is the kid brother to the X-Files' older brother.

What I enjoy best about the 4400 are the two lead actors- good chemistry between them; they really carry the show along, because even with all the bells and whistles, it's really a show about 2 people investigating crimes.  You (the viewer) need to care about how these crimes affect the 2 main characters in order to stay interested, and the show is outstanding in this respect.  The series is more character driven than your typical space-setting sci-fi.  It really has to be, since all the action takes place on earth.

2161894,5,B00062IDEW,"I began this series about a year ago, watched two episodes, then left it behind.  I don't know why, but it just never made it back into my DVD player.  Don't call me scared, because I wasn't, but I just wasn't instantly pulled into the show - now, a year later, I can't stop watching and waiting to see what will happen to those 4400 returnees.  This series, from the USA network, is slow, but not in a bad way.  It takes a while to pull you in, it makes you think, and consider all possibilities of this supposed ""ripple"" effect.  What pulled me back into this series after such a long absence was the lingering thought in my mind of what these individual stories had to do with the bigger picture.  The idea of the ""apocalypse"" seems to be a hot button item right now in pop culture (see the popularity of Cormac's ""The Road"" and NBC's ""Heroes""), and upon watching the finale of this opening season of ""The 4400"", you are hinted towards the idea that these returnees are back for a reason - to big to be explored in the first season, but giving your imagination enough to grow upon for the upcoming seasons.  This show has the potential to be HUGE, and as I begin the next season, I cannot wait to see where the unknown will take us.

This beginning season is you typical opening faucet of ideas.  We slowly learn about our characters, their ideas, their problems, and as we progress through the first 2-hour premiere, we see that something big is going to enter their lives.  From the personal, to the impersonal, to the hypothetical, the world as we know it will change with the return of these 4400 initial unknowns that have been missing from a range of 1-60 years.  What makes this series stand out is that it is not just two FBI agents against the world, like ""The X-Files"", but instead we see the pieces come together for all different storylines.  While we are focused on both Baldwin and Diana's stories respectfully, it is the stories of Shawn Farrell's powers, the pregnancy of Lily, and the thoughts of Maia that skillfully blend the drama to the science fiction.  Don't be fooled, this is a science-fiction program, but it uses it mainly as the background to a bigger storyline - the idea of human's trying to cope with a surrounding that didn't really change much over the past 60 years.

This is a tough series to review, and I don't know why.  I feel as if I talk too much about what I enjoyed about ""The 4400"", it may give too much away.  It was sequential, meaning that if you do plan on viewing the story, watch it in order, it will expose you to so much more.  The finale is breathtaking, giving you a final image that will last with you until you pick up the next season.  The characters are believable, while still being on the USA network - meaning that the voice could be a bit stronger.  The writing I believe will tighten up over time, while the smaller budget makes for obvious indoor/outdoor mistakes, but they are all forgiven because of the original idea.  This isn't your typical ""Lost"" moments where questions pile up and continue to pile eventually negating themselves within the storyline, these are situations, bounded by solutions, giving us a chance to actually enjoy the premise and the solutions.  Like I said when I started, this show is simple and slow, and typically I would be ranting and raving with anger, but the minds behind ""The 4400"" are genius.  They have used these non-formulaic procedures and created gripping television.  Here is an underexposed show that will obviously become a cult classic over time.

Overall, this is a short review because I am jumping headfirst into the next season, which (not to give anything away), I am salivating over.  The new season opens new doors, explains further, and gives us hope.  The secondary stories remain truthful and fun, giving us new faces to the supposed ""ripple effect"" that roots this program.  Personally, I think this is a great program right up there with the best sci-fi programming out there, I am upset that it took me so long to get back into it, but it is definitely a series to enjoy, contemplate, and enjoy again.

Acting is good, and special effects are usually not bad. But at some times the investigators don't act logically and situations are not always consistent.

""4400"" caught my attention immediately (when it first aired).  It is different with non-stop drama.  It is about thousands of people who return at one time yet disappeared over many years in the past.  The mystery of ""how, why, what and where"" drives the series.  There are times the mystery is so deep, you are not sure who the ""good guys"" are. Also, the mystery takes many turns with each discovery of the 4400's special powers.

It is well-written made thriller which keeps you glued to the storyline.  Owning the series gives you continuity and control.  Missing an episode is not a good idea.

Of course, it's centered not just around the titular players -- a group of individuals who've been abducted throughout history, and returned at present with, in some cases, supernatural powers -- but also follows two federal agents, Tom and Diana, who investigate all suspicious matters regarding the returnees. As the mystery unfolds, a smartly written, unexpected story is revealed, given heart by the very likable cast of characters who've been affected by it.

Naturally, in any tale involving more than a few people with mystical abilities, sooner or later a few troublemakers begin turning up -- powered or not -- and the well-constructed plot makes great use of ambition and reaction to serve up a highly entertaining story.

There are a few bonds throughout this season that one will become more and more drawn to, including the growing friendship between Richard and Lily, the humorously difficult connection between Tom and Diana, and the romance between Shawn and Nikki. But the most touching matter in this regard is probably the ingenious relationship between Diana and Maia -- a calm and collected little girl from the 1940s who, like the other returnees, has been sent back the same age as when she was taken. Growing lonely under government care, Maia is eventually taken in by a reluctant Diana, and from there the show develops a very interesting bond between the two as they become subtly closer. (Unfortunately, Season 2 removes the intrigue of this relationship by making them a bit too close -- to the point where things feel overbearing and typical).

This season is so well done that if it had been edited into three hours' worth of material and put in theaters, people would call it an extraordinary film. In its entirety, however, 'The 4400' Season 1 stands as one of the best television accomplishments of recent times.",1158796800,,2055,4.965116279069767

Then down the line, in an agency, they spot what seems to be a meteor approaching the planet earth in such speeds that they fear for the worst. The ""Nasa"" like agency launce missiles at the object but then it doesn't seem to slow down until they realize that the drop point would be at there own back yard.

Everyone races outside to see what they can not seem to stop, but are shocked to see a large white ball of light hovering above the lake and then exploding out with such force that knocked everyone down. This is where all the chaos starts to break out and there the start of the story beings. The return of all 4400 people who went missing throughout the years without any explanation.

Chapter 1:  The Return

This is basically the same summary as above, but then to add to it, everyone was sent to quarantine. And two agents Tom and Diana are assigned to the case to find out what the heck is going on. And at the same time Tom's son is in coma, and he wants to find answers from the only person who saw him last 3 years ago, his nephew. One of the missing 4400 who returned.

Chapter 2:  The New and Improved Carl Morrissey

This is by far the most interesting episode in this season I really liked. Carl Morrissey one of the 4400 goes back to trying to gain back his life that he has disappeared form find out a lot has changed. Changed so much that he finds out that he lost his firm, as well as visited his wife to see that she has aged so much that she is hardly ""all there."" This is where the first of the ""powers"" of the 4400 comes out. When the son of his long time partner in the firm doesn't want to give back the firm to the original owner, Carl, it enraged and tries to do something about it.

Chapter 3: Becoming

Just when you thought you caught the killer so long ago, he mysteriously appears again just when the 4400 return? That sounds pretty suspicious to Tom and Diana when they were sent to investigate the case. Just when they narrowed it down, they were being lead around in circles as the person who they tracked down confesses to the murder, suddenly another one shows up and confesses as well?

Chapter 4: Trial by Fire

This is where a lot of things start to happen. Kyle, Tom's son wakes up from coma, people are making bombs to kill off the 4400 one by one. And Jordan, a rich real estater devotes his time and money in making a community for the 4400 where the first customers were Lily and Richard, and maia, the girl with the mysteriously strange powers to see the future becomes part of Diana's life.

Chapter 5: White Light

Kyle is taken from the hospital from Tom and his soon to be Ex-Wife with no good reason from Home Land Security. Richard gets suspicious to why

Jordan is so interested in Lily, his wife and the baby. This is by far the episode that made me squirm and say NO DON'T END HERE!!! It's a must watch!",1158537600,,2954,4.233096085409253

2161992,5,B00062IDEW,"There is only one criticism to make about the first season of THE 4400:  It is just so frellin' short!  At five episodes, this is the shortest ""season"" of any show I know of.  In reality, it isn't a season so much as an extended teaser.  But that being said, it is a very effective teaser and definitely pricks the interest of any potential viewer.

The show centers around 4400 individuals who had disappeared over the previous few decades and who reappeared all at once and in the same place without any apparent aging.  No one has any memory of who took them or why, though we gradually learn that each of them has been altered in various ways.  One young girl is clairvoyant, a young man can affect the life force of creatures he touches, and one man has the fighting ability of two Bruce Lee's combined, while others have abilities of a more indeterminate nature.  The first few episodes focus on the attempt of the 4400 to reenter their own lives, at the alienation they experience, and on the suspicion that is focused on them by society.  All of this is seen both through the experience of a few of the 4400 along with members of the Department of Homeland Security who are assigned to watch over them.

This is a show rife with good things.  I'm a huge fan of the serial format as opposed to the episodic and THE 4400 largely adheres to the serial.  Several of these early episodes focus on a particular one of the 4400--one portrayed by Michael Moriarty in the pilot, one played by SEX AND THE CITY's David Eisenberg in the second--but even then the structure is built more around the story at large than that particular week's character.  Very little is resolved each week, which is a very good thing.  The fewer plot developments that get resolved in an episode, the better the show as a whole.  In addition to format, the show has a wonderful look.  I would like to know more about the camera work on the show.  They have gone for a look that employs both a high definition look with filters that emphasize earth tones rather than garish colors.  It is a wonderful show to look at.

Although the show is yet another produce of The Sci-Fi Capital of the World aka Vancouver (the number of top Sci-Fi and fantasy adventure shows produced in Vancouver--THE X-FILES, DARK ANGEL, STARGATE SG-1, STARGATE ATLANTIS, SMALLVILLE, DEAD LIKE ME, MILLENIUM, THE DEAD ZONE, BATTLESTAR GALATICA, THE LONE GUNMEN, SLIDERS, KINGDOM HOSPITAL, THE OUTER LIMITS, EUREKA--dwarfs that of Hollywood), the actors are not the standard group that one finds in most Vancouver productions.  As a result, you get a different feel from the other Vancouver shows, which tend to circulate the same group of actors (as delightful as they are).  In later seasons some of those actors are used, but to a much smaller degree than, say, SMALLVILLE and STARGATE SG-1, two shows that have had a vast overlap in guest stars.

Not a lot gets resolved in Season One.  It isn't much to say that it leaves you wanting more, since it didn't give a whole lot to begin with.  The two subsequent seasons were twelve episodes each, more than the first season but together comprising only as many episodes as a regular season of most other shows.  It is therefore a very different show from most, almost more on the British model of a small number of episodes rather than a large number.  But if one gets past the very small number of episodes this can be one of the most compelling Sci-Fi series on TV.",1155513600,,3467,4.56957928802589

Interesting idea, and I felt it really works.  True fans can't help but think that there is a potential goody bag of up to 4400 stories to choose from.  Interesting guests aside, the 4400 does follow a macro-plot that is skillfully woven around these smaller stories, and the whole effect leaves one with sense of suspense for the next episode.  A final note:  Don't get too attached to the more poorly acted roles - the hammer falls on some of them, and thankfully they don't make it into season 2.",1155168000,,778,4.856060606060606

My only complaint is that the first ""season"" was too short!

This science fiction series has much to offer for episodic television -- interesting characters, twisting plot and a venue for focusing on individuals within the story - lots of opportunities when 4400 actual individuals were ""abducted.""

They have no memory so there is now way of telling what happened to them.  Non-terrestial intelligence is suspected.  As time goes by it is discovered that some of these people have special powers--esp, knowing the future, and healing.  But some of the returnees also have destructive powers.

The 4400 become a lighting rod for the paranoid fears of the nation as well as the greed of power players.  They also have problems reintegrating into society and fitting in to their families.

Joel Gretsch and Jacqueline MacKenzie play the Homeland Security agents who are both investigating the 4400 and are personally involved with them.  This creates a nice tension as the two balance their jobs against their personal concerns.  Peter Coyote plays the head of their department.

I like the writing and the filming of 4400.  Sometimes there is a little hokey-ness to the plot line and the actors are a little flat--particularly MacKenzie who is pretty stiff and has strange expressions and body language. But somehow the whole thing works and I was left wanting more.

2162001,5,B00062IDEW,"If you haven't seen one episode of the 4400, you really need to start watching. I just got into it recently and now just decided to watch it from the beginning. The 3rd season isn't bad but I really missed some great tv by not watching it from the start. 4400 people disapear and reapear after a big ball of light appears in the sky. They all come back to their lives being different, their loved ones are either dead, moved on or just treat them differently. So they have to find their place in the world. On top of that they slowly realize that they have new abilities.

  Two agents, must work together to find out the secrets of the 4400. One Tom Baldwin volunteers to be on the case because he knows it will lead him to find out why his son is in a mysterious coma. While his nephew Shawn disapeared the same night his son was put in a coma. Now he's back and part of the 4400. Shawn soon finds that he can heal people and also finds that his brother's g/f  has a crush on him. As if his brother doesn't treat him strange after his reapearance already.

  While Conchita Campbell is adorable yet creepy as a child 4400 that was missing the longest. She can tell the future and even knows that things won't last very long with her new foster parents. Especially when she tells the husband what cemetary he'll be buried in. Bill Campbell (The Rocketeer, Enough) plays a rich and powerful man that decides to be the voice of the 4400 claiming that he too is one. He influences the others to realize that they are important and should embrace their new powers.

  Their was so many new sci-fi shows last season like Invasion and Surface and I thought they were trying to be like Lost but really they were trying to be like the 4400. Now NBC has Heroes coming out with people all over the world finding out that they have powers. Sound original ? Plus I doubt that will be as good or as fascinating as this.

The setting is Washington State.  4400 abductees, dating as far back as 1946, have been returned to Earth.  The complications, however, have only just begun...
Joel Gretsch, Jacqueline McKenzie, and the rest of this extraordinary cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.  Moreover, The 4400 does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.
The only (minor) setbacks are in relation to:
1) Not using the wonderful music from the pilot in the other episodes.
2) Tom Baldwin's annoying wife.
On the positive side:
1) The GREAT plot and concept.
2) The GREAT characters.
3) The GREAT acting.
4) In the episode titled Trial By Fire, The 4400 sheds light on the ""new"" Dept of Homeland Security and how they operate (e.g. ""You are being arrested as a terrorist.
You are being treated as an enemy combatant.  You do NOT have the right to remain silent..."" etc)

2162022,4,B00062IDEW,"I have been watching and reading sci-fi and fantasy for nearly 3 decades, and when I heard about the original plot of the 4400, I knew I had to see it.

The pilot episode reveals the story of the 4400, people who were taken from earth, only to reappear by Mt. Rainier many years later. They now have special powers. Many have said that the 4400 is a cross between the X-files and X-men. I would go one step further. The 4400 also is very soap opera-y, with stories of love, pregancy, divorce, business manuevers, etc.

After watching the first disk from season one, I was left with the impression that the show had a lot of potential, but wasn't quite there yet. As with all knew shows of this type, there is a ""feeling around"" process where the stories and actors who make them come alive take baby steps to flesh out the universe and their characters. I am looking forward to viewing the next episodes.

With that said, in watching the first season I became concerned that the casting decisions might be a little weak. Certain characters just don't ""feel right."" Take this for what its worth, and it might just be a personal choice.

In watching shows that have amazing casting, like Firefly, everything seems to fit. Everything seems natural. many things in the 4400 didn't seem to fit, connect, or work well together.

Peter Coyote seemed to be playing the same character he has been in nearly every movie I have seen him in. There is just something about him that distracts me from the story. I can't place my finger on it, but I am not sure he is the right man to play the Skinner-esque role. Understand, I am not yearning that this become the X-files.

Also, Jacqueline McKenzie as Diana Skouris and Joel Gretsch as Tom Baldwin don't feel quite right as well. This may simply be due to the fact that the first 2 episodes haven't show Skouris exercising much of her science speciality, and haven't revealed Baldwin doing any real detective work. They don't stand out enough yet, and I think part of this is the writer's fault, and maybe because they weren't the right actors to play the roles. 3 hours in, I didn't find myself gaining an affection for them.

Another thing the show hasn't done well yet is fleshing out the characters into 3 dimensions. We see the same characters emoting the same emotions and personas. Lily Moore Tyler could use a laugh, and dittos for Richard Tyler. Early on we see the same characetrs performing the same roles, and haven't witnessed many layers of character yet.

I know some people might dismiss my opinions, and that is OK. I do not hate the show. Again, I think it has a lot of potential. But I have seen sci-fi shows with amazing casts (again: Firefly, X-files, et al), and the 4400 crew isn't as lovable, likable or fluid as I am yearning for. Hopeully, as I watch future episodes, things will grow.",1152057600,5,2848,4.527237354085603

Like Lost, the series rotates around a few characters out of the 4400 people who just appear and each Episode is connected with the previous one, so watch from the first episode from season one. New mysteries pop up, old ones get solved and it goes on and on. Though The 4400 is not that interesting as Lost, Suprano or Prison Break, but its worth the watch.

Joel Gretsch (Tom) has done an outstanding job (as he did in series ""Taken"") along with Patrick Flueger (Shawn) - they are the main characters in this series and almost all episodes revolve around them.

One thing I didn't like much was the special effects. I was somewhat expecting more effects with the additional capabilities of The 4400, but hey, I can't compare it to X-men!

In short, both seasons are worth the buy!",1151539200,,968,4.4576271186440675
2162041,3,B00062IDEW,"While I didn't get into it at first for whatever reason, when a friend of mine loaned me season one of The 4400 on DVD I figured I'd bite, and I must say I wish I had been watching from the beginning.  This first season certainly isn't on the level of the debut seasons of, say, The Shield or The Sopranos, but it does present some interesting twists on the sci-fi format it initially appears to belong to.  In actuality, The 4400 is sort of a sci-fi/drama/mystery hybrid, and while it suffers a little bit from some hackneyed dialogue and not-so-special effects, The 4400 is still a mostly intelligent show whose steadily unfolding mysteries and shifting character dynamics make it more than worth tuning into.  The plot, as the title suggests, goes thusly: 4400 people, randomly abducted without a trace in various times and places, suddenly return in a ball of light in suburban Seattle, uninjured, dressed as they were when they disappeared, and with no memory whatsoever of what happened while they were gone.  That's not to say they haven't been profoundly changed during their trip, as several of the returnees start manifesting new and superhuman abilities right after they get back, and one woman finds herself pregnant with no logical explanation.  Naturally, the returnees have to face a world where a lot's changed but a lot has stayed the same as well, as the general public is no more rational or tolerant than it was before, and returning to society presents them with all kinds of problems.  This first season follows the efforts of some of the 4400, with the government's help, to get integrated back into society even as it becomes clear there's something different about them that won't make it easy.

The show's emphasis on the paranormal definitely gives it an X-Files-like feel, but it never follows a freak-of-the-week format, as its stand-alone plots are always integrated into the master narrative, and its sociological aspects are more comparable to the X-Men movies than anything else.  For a mere five episodes (including a two-hour pilot), the show does manage to cram in a lot of plotlines that nicely mix personal drama with social and political intrigue.  The pilot episode was a little rough-the direction and production values are similar to those of, well, a TV movie, and the writing produces a few howlers-but it does set the stage for its stories of people returning to a changed world and facing the changes in themselves, and those who are forgiving enough to keep watching will be rewarded with increasing returns on the show's intriguing premise.  The pilot makes the first intimations of special powers among the returnees, ranging from telekinesis to clairvoyance, and later episodes start exploring the connections and meaning behind these new gifts as a grand design starts to emerge.  It quickly becomes apparent that the 4400 were taken and returned for a reason, with single-episode plots exploring the ripple effects that result from the returnees' actions while the Feds try to connect the dots.

The show's two main characters-Homeland Security agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris-are basically variations on Agents Mulder and Scully, but both do eventually manage to emerge as interesting characters.  Initially, Tom's the intense, emotional family-man type, while Diana is the perpetually single, married-to-the-job type, but they each evolve over the course of the season as their investigations reveal new details behind the 4400's cases and their deeper implications.  They both have also clear emotional attachments to the work they're doing-Tom's nephew was taken and his son left in a three-year coma; Diana takes mildly creepy clairvoyant eight-year-old Maia into her apartment-and as the season goes on the intermingling of their professional and private lives becomes increasingly complicated by events.

Beyond the domestic drama, though, the show works largely because it's plugged into the atmosphere of fear and suspicion that accompanies the unknown.  The 4400 have come back as suddenly as they disappeared, under mysterious circumstances and with new powers, and naturally people's curiosity eventually gives way to media-driven fearmongering and anger at governmental secrecy, especially when a returned serial killer picks up his murder spree after a twenty-year absence.  Obviously there are some parallels to be made with the events of today as fears of immigration and terrorism have produced all kinds of craziness and overblown rhetoric (some of it justified, some not), but the hatred and prejudice the 4400 create speaks to something that goes beyond any one time, place or issue.  Sometimes it's as personal as it is political, as when Tom's nephew Shawn has to face life as a returnee in high school (which sucked enough on its own, as I recall) along with the animosity of his resentful younger brother.  Sometimes it's a mixture of both, as when inexplicably pregnant Lily and her black ex-combat pilot boyfriend find themselves welcomed by returned real-estate tycoon Jordan Collier and quickly start to question the motives behind his friendliness.

I've heard season two sort of fulfills the promise of season one, but since I'm pretty sure I have to give this one back before I can get it I probably won't know for a while.  Based on what I've seen, though, it's highly plausible that this brief season (really more akin to a miniseries than anything else) could be the setup for something better.  Once some of the early kinks (overwritten dialogue, weak production values, occasionally melodramatic acting) were ironed out and the main narrative started picking up steam, I for one found myself intrigued about what would happen next.  Fortunately, it appears the story is far from over.",1151107200,3,5777,5.128860489882854
2162042,4,B00062IDEW,"This series was recommended to me by a friend of mine and never got around to picking it up or renting it.  I had the occasion to catch a few of the episodes on TV and was impressed by the writing and the acting done in this series.  So I picked it up and am glad I did.

The story is about 4400 people who have disappeared over the last 70 years and how they are suddenly deposited back, but have not aged a day.  It shows, but doesn't center around the bigotry that such an outsider group would encounter.  The actors who play the main characters do a good job overall with some very interesting performances from the supporting cast as well.

In comparing with another recent sci-fi show, Firefly, I think this had a much stronger beginning, but a weaker overall ""universe"" to exist in.  The acting in this series starts strong, with little need for the actors to get comfortable with their characters whereas Firefly really took a couple episodes to find who they were.

I would recommend this to folks who like science fiction but are looking for something more than just the Star Trek.",1150934400,,1091,4.447236180904523

This first season developed such a wide array of characters - so vividly, so interestingly and so quickly that I became addicted right from jump street.  How good is it?  Once you see the opening episode you'll be on ebay ordering season two the next day!",1150848000,,385,4.617647058823529
2162044,3,B00062IDEW,"I think ""The 4400"" is a great show. If I were only grading the series itself, I would definitely give it five stars. But ""The 4400"", as a DVD product, is rather disappointing, so that's why I'm only giving it a middle-of-the-road score.

All they've done here is slap the episodes onto DVDs and shoved them into packages. So, you get what you pay for, the first season's episodes, but that's all you get. There are no bells and whistles that come with this DVD -- not even so much as a tiny toot. There are no commentaries, no deleted scenes, no behind the scenes looks. There isn't even a blooper reel. All the ""extras"" one usually gets with a DVD are completely absent here. Of course, I didn't buy this to get ""extras""; I bought the DVD because I wanted to see the episodes. I don't have cable and had heard good things about ""The 4400"". But, I don't think it would have killed them to throw in a short interview with the show's creators. I was very curious to know what their thought process was when they were coming up with this story.

I understand that the DVD for the second season has more meat on its bones in terms of ""extras"". That's great, but we're talking about *this* DVD. With this one, they didn't really put their best foot forward.

Having said all that, I would still suggest that anyone who loves good SF buy the DVD. I'm often struck by the high quality of written SF in novels, anthologies and magazines compared to what passes for SF in movies and, especially, on TV. Largely, I think it's dreck. But ""The 4400"" rises above all that.

This is great storytelling. The first season tells a tightly-woven story in just a few episodes about these people who have mysteriously returned and the aftermath of this major event. I like this series because it's realistic. Yes, the arrival of the 4400 causes global upset, but only at certain levels. Overall, the world still continues pretty much as it always has. Too often, in SF shows, the alien/mothership/angel arrives on Earth and the whole planet is suddenly changed. Yeah -- it probably wouldn't happen that way. There would still be work the next morning, traffic jams and long lines at Starbucks.

I also admire the fact that the cast is filled with really good actors. I don't think there is a weak link in the bunch.

Most importantly, I like that the story takes time to let us get to know the characters but still advances its overall plot. At the end of the first season, there are, to be sure, major mysteries still uncovered, but we do get some questions answered. They don't drag things out, and that's good in my book. I hate to admit it, but after about a decade on the air, I still didn't know, in the end, what in blue blazes was going on with ""The X-Files"".

This DVD, despite its bare-bones quality, is well worth purchasing for the great story.",1150243200,2,2836,4.473887814313346
2162045,4,B00062IDEW,"The last year had a lot of creepy-suspenseful shows, sort of crosses between ""X-Files"" and ""Lost."" But before those shows came out, there was the most underrated one: ""The 4400,"" a suspenseful, intelligent show that looks not at mysterious abductions -- but mysterious returns.

1946: A little girl vanishes in the woods. 1951: A black GI vanishes from a tent. 1979: A corporate head vanishes from his car. 2001: A teenager vanishes from a camping trip, leaving his cousin in a coma. In 2004, a comet is on a collision course with Earth, causing widespread panic. But instead of crashing, it hovers over a Seattle lake -- and leaves 4400 bewildered people around the lakeside.

These people all vanished over the past sixty years, and have been returned without any aging, and with no memory of what happened to them in the time they were gone. Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch), whose son is the one in a coma, is desperate to find out what did happen, so he rejoins Homeland Security to keep tabs on the ""4400,"" as they are now known.

Some like his nephew Shawn (Patrick Flueger) return to their old lives, only to find that they are reviled. And some like ex-GI Richard (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) and his girlfriend's granddaughter Lily (Laura Allen) find that they have no lives to return to. Ostracized and threatened, they start to draw together. But the strangest thing is that the 4400 are starting to show signs of X-Men-like powers: super speed, clairvoyance, telekinesis, healing, and mind control.

Tom and his HS partner Diana Skouros (Jacqueline McKenzie) track down both rogue abductees, and try to prevent harm from coming to the innocent 4400s. But when Shawn heals Tom's son Kyle (Chad Faust), Kyle comes back changed -- and his strange behavior holds the key to the 4400's purpose on Earth.

Okay, the complete first season of ""4400"" is only five episodes long, making it about the length of a miniseries. But unlike most shows on TV, its writers cram a whole season's worth of plot into only six hours.  In most movies and shows, people who vanish and then are returned are always welcomed back. This time, they are treated with suspicion and even hatred, and many are completely alone.

There are standalone ""4400 of the week"" stories, like the one about a 4400 serial killer, or a vigilante who is using his powers. But there are also intertwining plots about how the 4400s try to survive in a new world that fears them. We see Shawn trying to fit back into high school, and Richard and Lily finding that they have no homes left, and building a home together.

And the final episode is absolutely mind-blowing, with sudden shifts in Homeland Security's power, a sinister megamogul, and Tom desperately trying to save his son. While the mystery of the 4400s is partly solved, there are lots of questions left over for the recently released second season. It's satisfying, but will leave you wanting more.

The acting is kind of stiff in the first episode or two, but when the actors settle into their roles they do a solid job. Gretsch and McKenzie have good-cop/bad-cop chemistry, and they do a good job playing off each other's personalities. Flueger soon does a good job as a a tormented teenager, and Ali is nothing short of brilliant with his confused, bittersweet Richard. The one real problem is Conchita Campbell, who spends most of the season playing the Smiling Little Kid Who Makes Creepy Pronouncements.

""The 4400"" is one of the more intelligent new shows on TV, with a new spin on the typical ""abducted by aliens"" plot. Suspenseful, smart and well-written, this is one to keep an eye on.",1149984000,5,3614,4.768
2162046,4,B00062IDEW,"I bought this Season more or less on a whim.  My family and I had really enjoyed watching the miniseries TAKEN, from the sci-fi channel on DVD.  Because I don't have cable, I often rely on DVD releases to catch the shows with a lot of buzz.  I had vaguely heard of THE 4400, but bought it more because I hoped it would be good quality entertainment like TAKEN than because I knew much about the show itself.

My family and I have been very pleased.  It's a very interesting story, about abductees from the past 60 years or so all being returned to earth on the same day...none having aged one bit and none knowing what has happened to them.  We discover early on that they have all returned a bit ""altered"" too, with some interesting new powers.

The idea that these folks have to deal with losing 50 years of their lives (in some cases) and that their loved ones have moved on or died, is compelling.  The new powers are interesting.  And the politics involved in them assimilating back into society are a nice touch.  The gripping pilot episode neatly sets things up and introduces the main characters.

We have a Mulder & Scully of sorts...two slightly mismatched investigators from Homeland Security.  This pair investigates a different returnee each episode...learning aobut new powers and trying to figure out the ""ripple effect"" that these new powers are supposed to have.  This makes each episode a tidy stand-alone.  Yet at the same time, each episode explores the characters and developments of a few returnees whom we've followed from the beginning.  A little girl from the '40s.  A black soldier from 1951.  A young housewife from the early 90s and best of all, a teenager from just a couple of years ago, who happens to be the nephew of one of our two lead investigators.  His powers, his relationship with his uncle and connection to his uncle's son are intriguing.

So, from a plot standpoint, this is very good stuff.  There are minor quibbles.  For the most part, the show is clearly on a low budget and this is seldom a problem.  Very few true special effects are needed...but when they do trot one out, it's a bit weak.  Not enough to make you groan, but it's good they've found a low tech way to proceed through 99% of the show.  The acting is occasionally spotty.  Joel Gretsch (who I remember well from TAKEN) plays the male investigator, and he's probably the best of the bunch.  He looks like a bit of a hard**s and speaks with authority...yet when called upon to be a bit more emotional, he presents it convincingly.  He's no Oscar-winner, but like the show, he seems to know how much he can push his talents.  Everyone else is okay, with the teens all a bit moody in the ""One Tree Hill"" mode.  No one will win an Emmy for acting in this show...but everyone is at least consistent and they are all pitched at the same level.  They all play it straight and unironic, which is great.  No cynicism...this stuff is real to their characters and the actors stay true to that.\

I mentioned X-Files earlier, and there are comparisons beyond the man/woman pair that investigates.  There's the family connection to the events of the day  (lead investigator has a son and nephew who are connected somehow to all the weirdness...Mulder had a sister connected to the conspiracy).  There's the Vancouver locations.  There's the gruff boss (Peter Coyote in THE 4400). Even the feel of the camerawork is often similar.  But the big difference is that no one doubts that weird things are happening or that 4400 people returned.  While I smile at the similarities...I like the show enough not to really care.

It's a pretty good show for families, but there is occasional cussing that wouldn't make it on to network TV.  If you are even a casual fan of sci-fi, or X-Files...I highly recommend this well-crafted show.  I'm very much looking forward to Season 2 arriving in my mailbox!",1149638400,8,3891,4.621897810218978

The characters are the key and the leads are charismatic enough, if not on the level of Scully/Mulder, Benson/Stabler, or even Monk/Sharona.

2162066,2,B00062IDEW,"I've only seen the pilot and the second episode, but so far I'm not as impressed as I had hoped.  Though the idea is loaded with possibilities, the execution is poor, from clunky dialog that lurches from the absurd to the trite (what little girl would say, when referring to the rain, ""It's only a light shower""?)o poor acting and X-Files-like stories. There's an interesting and recent French movie called ""They Came Back."" You might call it an anti-zombie film about what would happen if the dead rose up from their graves and returned to their towns. They haven't decomposed or anything like that; they're as they were just before they died.  How would society reintegrate them?

After that, nothing make sense.  Some viewer on here are very good at Math to calculate the change of the speed of the comet and such on, I'm not good at math, cos' still you can always use Alien stuff to explain it.  However, to stop the comet to destroying our earth, we all saw in tens of missiles launched by different countries at DIFFERENT times.  Guess what?  They all hit the comet at the very same time.  Gosh! I really hope all those countries can be really such unified in the United Nation.

Other scene was when they were back to the Highland beach to explain why Tom was the key figure, while Kyle holding Tom and explaining all the reasons why 4400 come back, and the fellow agent fired a bullet to them.  Was that an intelligent bullet? How can that be possible to change the course to hit Kyle right in the chest from the position they stand?  Plus, I would have thought the bright light is a nuclear proof one!

Had the production spend more time on the story and setting, those scene could have been shown in a more acceptable and respectable way.

Casting is BAD!  Disaster!  Yes, that little girl was not cute, I have to agree to other viewer, and I want to puke every time she slip the future thru' her mouth.  Trying so hard to be an innocent 9 years old!

That guy, Tom is a bad character, I never believe if anyone with that personality can work in his position, his boss claimed he was the best investigator.

2162099,4,B00062IDEW,The first season of the 4400 is only 5 episodes. It gives you real insight into the 4400 as well as the hardships that they have to face. You see the struggle of a family to put itself back together again. It also gives you insight into human nature when we are faced with something that we don't understand. I give it 4 stars defiantly on my recommended buy list.,1127865600,,364,4.214285714285714
2162100,5,B00062IDEW,"The series premise is that people from the future are responsible for 4400 abductions over an 80 year time period. Suddenly they are returned to the present.

This series works on multiple levels, and that's what makes it work.

The future is manipulating the past in order to save the future. To do this, the future has given each of the returnees a special ability or role to play.

Governmental responsibility is managed by Homeland Security and all the pitfalls of the Patriot Act are quietly introduced.

Then there are the people as they attempt to pick up their lives. In some cases it works and in others, everything has fallen apart during their absence.

Where Mulder and Skully (of X-File fame) chased the elusive aliens, this show takes things a step closer to the truth. It is a fascinating chase as each episode reveals another piece of the puzzle.

2162115,1,B00062IDEW,"The fact that they had been abducted and came back years later is OK. But it ends right there. What follows is a sequence of cliches, predictable occurrances and love stories. If you enjoy watching soap operas, it's a great show. Full of teens in love, husbands and wifes not getting along, people falling in love. - ""Oh, I burned my hand"" , says the girl. ""Let me see it"", says the boy holding her hand. The boy holding her hand has supernatural powers. He heals the wound caused by the heat and they kiss. - A beautfiful moment if you enjoy soap operas as I said. But it was enough for me to turn off the TV and go to sleep. If you want to do something that stupid, don't do it using sci-fi as a source of inspiration for the show. Just do another series like Dawson's Creek or the like. I'm sure the ratings would  be higher because there wouldn't be people who REALLY like science fiction complaining about the lack of intelligence and good sense in the show. Besides that, there is this group of people that think that every TV show that features a flying soucer is science fiction. They call me and ask, ""Have you seen this new sci-fi show, the 4400 ?"". I have to spend hours explaining them that MILLENIUM, THE X FILES, PLANETE OF THE APES, are totally different from it(because they think they are all science fiction thus they are the same). This is the group that I call ""THE MIXERS"" because they mix things up. If the 4400 hadn't featured that gigantic BLUE BALL, at least you would have saved me the trouble of having to explain these people that there is a difference between good fiction (which seems real) and bad fiction (which things are predicatble, like in soap operas). I still think you can straight things out. Go back to TV and give it another shot. Here's a tip : little by little, you start to forget that they came back from the sky and have powers. As time goes by, this sci-fi thing begins to fade away. Believe me, the audience will not notice it. So by the end of the season, you already have a show in the style of love and teens stories. I'm sure it will definately catch on. Best of luck!",1127347200,5,2121,4.315789473684211

2162118,3,B00062IDEW,"A comet is headed toward Earth and appears to be on a collision course. The world's governments launch all of their nuclear arsenals at it, hoping that the explosions might divert it. But they don't. The comet continues toward our little blue planet and, as it approaches, suddenly slows and changes direction. Do comets do that?

This outer-space ball of light comes in for a landing near Mount Ranier in Washington and quickly deposits 4400 people (humans) onto the ground. Then the ball of light vanishes. But the people it left behind remain. Who are they?

They turn out to be the 4400 people who've been abducted over the past 60 years or so. By aliens? A higher power? We're not sure. What is evident, however, is that none of them have aged a second beyond their initial abduction date, and none have any memory of where they were.

Initially, all of the returnees are kept in a lock-down facility run by the Agency for Homeland Security. Peter Coyote plays the boss of Seattle's Homeland Security office and is bombarded with problems. The media want to know who all of the returnees are. Many people fear them, believing the 4400 to be virus vectors or ticking time-bombs. But none of this comes to pass, and the ACLU gets involved and aids in the returnees release.

Soon after their release, little clues about what has happened to the 4400 slowly emerge. One of them, a little girl named Maia (is it a coincidence that her name is very close to Gaia?), has clairvoyant abilities. Another possess the ability to control life and death with the touch of his hands. While others have incredible reflexes or are pregnant and weren't before the abduction.

Prejudices against the 4400 soon break out. People fear these ""different"" humans. Bombs begin to explode around the 4400. Death threats come in. Have we humans not learned anything from our past? Native Americans. Black Slaves. Religious variations. These also have led to fear of ""the different"" and subsequent abuses.

******************************************************************************

The series' premise is good but the execution a bit flawed. From the very first episode I began noticing errors or convenient inconsistencies. For instance, when the world launches their nuclear weapons at what they thought was a comet, the weapons reach the comet in a few minutes, even though it hasn't passed by the moon yet. Uh ...I don't think so. It'd take days or weeks for that to happen.

The world's people were abducted (not just America's), but we see little to no commentary about this. The only mention of it was during the first episode which said that ""most countries don't want to repatriate their abductees."" So if that was the case, where are these foreign soil returnees and how are they adjusting not only to being returned, but returned to a foreign country?

Even with these flaws, however, I found the first season engaging enough to continue watching. The acting is excellent and the special effects are okay (contrary to what others have posted here, saying things like ""cheesy"", etc. about them.)

There are also so many story lines to follow that I could see this series (like LOST) continuing on for many seasons. If a viewer became bored with one or two abductees' stories, all they need to do is keep on watching and the next episode is bound to add another.",1126742400,4,3355,4.880492091388401

And even if we can relate, we are wary of their intent, because they are not us. We only know what's inside OUR minds, which may or may not be what any or all of the 4400 is feeling or thinking. I never miss an episode, and want this in my collection. We can always find things in the script we would have written a different way, but over all, this series is the best and the worst of all of humanity on both sides of the divide.

As a fan of sci-fi and shows like Lost, I thought this will do in between seasons of Lost.  However, the writing on this show basically sucks.  I can't count how many times I rolled my eyes during the pilot episode alone. The story is contrived, predictable, and just plain stupid.  The characters lack common sense and it's like they throw in every cliche out there.  Seriously, what sane person will issue a restraining order on his missing wife, mother of his child, who's returned after 11 years???

The show focuses on the slow unfolding of the reason they have returned to earth as two government agents investigate these returnees to determine the answer. Both agents have a relationship either previous or newly formed with a returnee which provides clues to the mystery along the way.

As a huge fan of X-Files, Outer Limits, and science fiction in general, I can't say enough about this show. I found it to be entertaining, fast paced, dramatic and amazing in the subject matter it addresses. The story is riveting as you empathize for these 4400 people that have missed a block of their lives and can't remember how or why they disappeared. For each of them, time had stopped and then restarted upon their return which poses an enormous potential for stories and mysteries to solve.

I like this series a lot. The premise is imaginative and the stories are pretty good.

The series is ""The X-files"" meets ""X-Men."" Many of the 4400 start to exhibit strange powers. The initial season deals with two detectives trying to find the source and purpose behind the abductions as well as showing the reactionary responses of the people and governments to these returnees.

The acting is good, the stories are brilliant (I especially enjoy the one where a grocery store worker is given enhanced power and speed and proceeds to clean up a local park that had become dangerous during his absence), and the characters are unique and memorable (my favorite here is a young girl named Mia who was abducted in the 40s and is returned clairvoyant).

The only negative is the decided lack of extras on the DVD set. No commentaries, bloopers, sneak peeks, behind the scenes, or 4400 character files.

I was given a brief synopsis of this show from a friend of mine and decided to order the DVD's and give the show a shot hoping that I might have a show I could be interested in.

And in the end, yes, this is a show worth watching.  All the characters are real and well developed.  Best of all, there is a riveting and intriguing plot that keeps you wanting to catch the next episode.  Many reviewers comment that it reminds them a lot of the X-Files but I think it more closely resembles

Steven Spielberg's ""Taken.""

The first season was given five episodes to prove itself and was later approved for a second season.  These five episodes introduce with a very big question regarding the 4400.  A lot of the questions are answered by the end of the season, but many more questions arise to make way for an excellent second season.

The five episodes are:

1. The Pilot.  This is a 2 hour episode (much less minus the commercials).  The first half sets up the story and introduces you to most of the main characters as the 4,400 abductees are returned to earth in what appears to be a large, bright comet.  The department of homeland security takes the abductees and Agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris are assigned to the task of finding the answers to the 4400.  After the 4400 are let go the second half of the show follows one of the abductees, Orson Bailey who appears to have developed newly found special abilities.

2. The New & Improved Carl Morrissey. Carl Morrissey has returned home to not only find that his neighborhood has changed, but so has he.  He attempts to fix what has gone wrong in the neighborhood with his new-found special powers.

3. Becoming:  Jordan Collier makes his initial appearance in this episode.  He is a wealthy abductee who heads a large company and uses his power and assets to start bringing the 4400 together.  His true motives have not revealed but it does add to the overall plot of the story.  Also, a serial killer appears to be one of the 4400 and has returned to his old habits.  Unfortunately, he has new tricks up his sleeves that leaves everybody baffled on how it happens.

4. Trial By Fire.  When the 4400 names are posted on the Internet a small group of people start killing them off.  Jordan is still gathering the 4400 into his group.

5. White Light: Many of the questions are finally answered in this episode.  Specifically, what happened to Kyle, Agent Baldwin's son and what happened to the 4400 to begin with.  Also, one of the abductees is having a baby, and it appears that this baby holds a lot more answers to the reason the 4400 are returned.  Finally, the motives of Jordan Collier seem to not be as altruistic as it appears in his interest with the 4400.

All in all, if you like sci-fi, fantasy, or anything with a good story line then I highly recommend this show.  This show actually has me interested in television again as I'm watching the 4400 marathon on USA while typing this review.  Excellent casting, excellent acting, excellent characters, excellent story, excellent, excellent, excellent!!!",1120348800,5,3251,4.548275862068966
2162151,5,B00062IDEW,"I watched an episode of The 4400 based on a review of the show I read somewhere else. I've always been into TV sci-fi but hadn't really gotten into it over the last couple of years, some of the shows out there just seemed like rehashed ideas.

This show, although it takes some X-files cues, is VERY original and the premise is excellent. Needless to say after I saw the episode i got a season pass for it on my Tivo and then got the DVD....Well I just saw all 5 episodes back to back. My wife and I kept jumping to the next episode to see what happened next! We never do this!

The story is addictive and the show is character based (no special effects overload) which makes you care about them and where they're headed in the plot. The fact that we will surely continue learning about more 4400's and build layers upon layers to the plot as the show goes along is very promising.

Really good science fiction, such as the film Bladerunner, has characters one can relate to and care about.

Overall, this is an enjoyable sci-fi series that does a good job of realistically protraying an extraordinary event.  The acting can be a bit wooden at times, but the quality of the story makes up for it.  The only serious complaint I have is with the intro sequence (SLIGHT SPOILER):

Homeland Security (and, presumably, SAC/NORAD) scrambles when the ""ball of light"" is approximately 1/2 an hour from impact with the Earth's surface.  At one point, however, the ball is viewed from space flying past the Moon.  Sorry, but that's a bit more than 1/2 an hour away.  To make the trip from the Moon in 30 minutes, the ball would have to travel around 13,000 km/minute.  Assuming a comet travels at around 150,000 mph (which I think is what was used to analyze Halley's), that comet's speed would be around 5500 km/sec (if I did my math right).

Also, everyone's screaming about launching ""Titan IIs"" to blow the ball up.  I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure the Titan II was decomissioned almost 20 years ago.  The ICBMs we'd launch -- assuming we could modify their targeting programs in time to send them straight up into space -- would most likely be Peacekeepers, or at least Minutemen.

He was on LAW&ORDER SVU in an incredible episode where he was dating a girl ala ROMEO&JULIET where their parents didn't want them together, but she turned up dead and pregnant with his kid THEN it turned out they shared the same dad (he had two families). He blew me away so I searched IMDB.com to see what he was doing and I saw he was on THE 4400 on USA. Thank God for DVR as I decided to DVR the first-run series as of June 5th. It taped all 5 of 2004's episodes plus Sunday's season premiere. Can I just say I've never been a Trekkie, heavily into Star Wars, or any Sci-fi stuff. And usually when I watch shows I am online at my desk while the TV is on. This is the ONLY show I have to sit down and do nothing but watch. The storylines are so engaging its almost like why hasn't anyone thought of this before? My two favorite characters are of course Shawn (Patrick Flueger) and Maia (Conchita Campbell). I can't say enough about how great this show is. Thankfully it was renewed. And it has a new fan!",1118016000,7,1052,4.161764705882353
2162167,5,B00062IDEW,"Alot of fans have related THE 4400 to THE X-FILES.  It is not the X-Files.  While the X-Files was centered around Mulder and Scully and they had cases come to them that covered the gammit from seamonster to possession to little green men the 4400's agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris have one central case that they are assigned to with many other smaller cases being branched off of it.

The case Baldwin and Skouris are investigating is ""What happened to the 4400?""  That is what the entire series centers around, the Orson Baily phenomenon, the Oliver Knox copycat, and the arsons that sprout up are all parts of the larger question.

The acting in this series itself is supurb, for example you have Richard Tyler (Ali) who was abducted in the 1950s in South Korea.  When Richard returns he is first seen looking through a magazine saying ""The Secretary of State is black!"" And eight year old Cochita Campbell who plays Maia Ruteledge displays such courage and toughness having been abducted in 1938.  An example is in the pilot when the foster parents that Maia was set up in bring her back to quarentine and Ryland talks to her opening the conversation with a remark on the weather, Maia responds with ""You didn't come out here to talk with me about the weather.""

There is also a great score to scenes that signify importance, like in the scene where the abductees return.  The score is so bone-chilling that it terrifies the viewer.

There is also a romance factor to the story as well as Richard Tyler and Lily Moore hook up because Richard knew her grandmother. Other factors in this series include rage, that of a father not being able to help his son, and caring as Diana takes eight-year-old Maia home to live with her because as Maia states ""I don't like being alone and you don't like being alone either.""

All in all THE 4400 is a well thought out, well put together series that should be given a chance.

Note: Just as a sidenote, Jacqueline Mckenzie, who plays Diana Skouris was actually given the holster that Gillian Anderson used to play Agent Scully (the holster didn't fit as Mckenzie states, ""It liked like I had another arm petruding from my hip,"").",1113955200,18,2175,4.62077922077922
2162168,5,B00062IDEW,"Simply put... If you like government conspiracy's, the existence of extraterrestrial life, the fight for truth, and the belief that the  ""The Truth Is Out There"", this show is for you.  And this time, it  is set inside the government and their wicked lies.  The 4400 is simply a work of genius.  Since the X-Files ended, I have been longing for the next Mulder/Scully deal. I have found something real close.  Different lives all sweetly interconnected without being to overdramatic and sobby.  Many tales and surprises unfold, in every episode.  Every episode is completely connected to the next, unlike the X-Files.  The fact that all the 4400 abductees come from different eras of the 1900's, and they awaken  in the future thinking that it is their own time, except it is 2003 is brilliant. The multiple revelations of lost time, and the search for belonging, the powers that help along the way are all wisely concepted.  Amazingly creative for a low budget miniseries.  Can't wait for the sencond season...and THE X-FILES 2 the movie!!! BRING IT ON CHRIS, SPOTNIK, DAVID AND GILLIAN. We need the next dose of anti-hybrid solution.",1111017600,14,1135,4.91578947368421
2162169,2,B00062IDEW,"I heard about this show and the ratings it got on the Pilot episode and decided to watch it from the beginning. Big mistake.

I must admit though that I watched the first 4 episodes and with so much to do and better shows to watch, I never cared to watch the last 2, so maybe the final 2 episodes gave viewers some answers as to what exactly was happening with The 4400 and the ones from that group that you actually get to know.

But they dragged it so much that by the third episode, you just want to know and are no longer interested in the stories of these freaks.

Also, the main characters who were working to find out what the hell was going on were not very interesting.

I'd recommend these 5 shows over The 4400 any day:

24, Nip/Tuck, Lost, Alias, and The O.C. (which is great if you like young hotties).

24 is so much more intriguing. Nip/Tuck is so much more fun. Lost has great characters and Alias is just really cool.",1109721600,12,934,4.189944134078212
2162170,5,B00062IDEW,"I loved this show.  I wanted to watch it last summer when it was on tv, but I only got to see part of the pilot episode.  It left me wanting more.  When I saw that it had come out on dvd, I just knew that I had to see it.  I watched the whole thing over a period of two days and I loved every bit of it.  I don't normally watch sci-fi, but there was enough drama in it that it kept me interested.  It answered some questions while leaving others unanswered in preparation for another season.  There are only 5 episodes because it started out as a miniseries, but I'm so glad to hear that it got picked up for another 13 episodes.  They will be able to do so much with it because there are 4400 stories out there about each of the returnees.  It seemed like it addressed a lot of the questions and fears that people would have if something like this were to happen.  I just can't recommend it more for anyone that is slightly interested.",1108512000,35,936,4.065573770491803
2162171,5,B00062IDEW,"This story centres on 4400 people who, at various times throughout the last 60 years have gone missing. One night a huge ball of light appears by a lake in Washington State. The light disappears leaving behind the 4400 missing people. They have no memory of where they have been or what has happened to them. As far as they are aware, no time has passed.

The tale unfolds as various key characters are introduced and the realisation hits that the 4400 are now 'different', they have strange gifts or powers. What remains to be discovered is where they have been, why they were taken and, most important of all, what is the purpose of their return.

This DVD set features all of series 1 over 2 discs. There are no extras except for subtitles for the hard of hearing. In spite of there being no extras this is a set still well worth buying, the story alone is worth the purchase price.",1108166400,84,885,4.423312883435583
2162172,5,B00062IDEW,"When I bought this, it was because my all-time favorite mini-series, Taken, was $105 and while I may love the show, I can't/won't afford to pay that. So through hepful links from there I found The 4400 and for $20 figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try.

Well, having seen all of it now, I can safely say it's the greatest thing to ever come from the USA Network (along with a superior adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining). The stories all move at a good pace (if you hear it's slow, these people have the attention span of a shovel) and the stories are all interesting. It sucks that all you get is the shows, but that's not going to knock my grading down at all. I like extras, but they aren't the be all, end all of my viewing experience.

Can you imagine if this weren't successful and would've ended after these five episodes? It would've been horrible. The 4400 takes you into a great, believable world, with lots of plots and action and twists along the way as the mystery of these people, and their return, is followed.

I can't wait for Season 2!",1106870400,17,1063,4.331658291457287
2162173,5,B00062IDEW,"If you love the suspense of 24 (Kiefer Sutherland), and the optimism of Star Trek, you'll love The 4400.

Agents of the Deparment of Homeland Security race against time to find answers and assess the threat posed by the 4400 returnees. Are they really who they say they are, or aliens in disguise?  Who took them and why?  Why return them?  Could someone who would tear apart the lives of 4400 families and then dump 4400 people--years and even decades after their disappearances (when most simply have nothing to come back to anymore) be anything but malevolent?  Are they a threat to mankind?  Are the returnees a prelude to invasion?

As the mysterious powers and purposes of each returnee are gradually revealed, we get tantalzing glimpses at a grand design....

Anti-returnee hysteria is spreading like wildfire, and  returnees are being senselessly murdered by fanatics.  Will the government be able to figure out the answers in time, before more people die?",1106524800,9,964,4.96875
2162174,3,B00062IDEW,"A ""comet"" is racing toward Earth. The U.S. and other nations launch missiles to stop it. Within minutes, the missiles strike their target. We then see a scene where the ""comet"" is still racing toward Earth - from beyond the orbit of the Moon. So, we are expected to believe that missiles in 2004 can reach a point near the Moon - in just minutes - that it took the Apollo astronauts days to reach.

If you suspect ""The 4400"" doesn't respect the viewer's intelligence - that it has a habit of taking easy shortcuts to advance its story arc - you're right. Substandard drama. Substandard science fiction.

There are also disturbing aspects to ""The 4400,"" not the least of which is the fact that Homeland Security provides the ""heroes"" for this series. The HS agent, Tom, revels in delivering lines like, ""You do NOT have the right to an attorney! You do NOT have the right to remain silent! Anything you say WILL be used against you!"" And Tom's boss at HS revels in undermining a free (if unlikeable) press.

This series's writers are about as good at understanding what constitutes ""good guys"" as they are at understanding the physics of space flight. ""The 4400"" is definitely aimed at an audience that's no better at picking TV shows than it is at picking U.S. presidents.",1106006400,6,1272,4.619469026548672
