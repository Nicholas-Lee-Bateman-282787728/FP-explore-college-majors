8030613,4,B0002Q9VRA,"I love the titles that they used to give to most of these old UFC contests.  I wish that theyd bring that back.  Anyway, reviewing bouts that are over ten years old when so many more amazing fights clutter my memory makes me wonder what would be important to someone who hasn't seen these older fights and if they're worth a view?  Id say that this card, while no wise bad, is a pass.  But if you're gonna watch you might watch it for:

> Chuck Liddell and Vernon Tiger White, with a little bad blood between them, pound some tar out of each other and marvel (as Liddell seemed to do during the fight) how White kept standing after a couple of those shots.
> The developing and deserving of respect Yves Edwards delivering a stumbling head kick to Josh Thompson to end the match.
> A jiu jitsu chess match between the intimidating Nick Diaz and the unintimidated Karo Parisyan.  Some say this ground battle is boring but watching these two switch and reverse and constantly put each other in and stave off jeopardy was edge-of-your-seat tension at times.

Pass if you're tempted to watch it because you're a Couture or Belfort fan (especially if you're a Belfort fan because he shows up but then soon looks like hes ready to leave and waiting for the bell; I guarantee you he wanted out of that Octagon before the end of the second round).  Bloody, bloody fight.",1421539200,,1362,4.463709677419355

8030616,5,B0002Q9VRA,"This is another solid UFC event - a night packed with great fights.

The night begins with Yves Edwards turning the tables on (or ""lucking out"" against) Josh Thompson, who had been overpowering and outperforming him until that point.  The night then gets better with the next fight between Nick Diaz and Karo Parisyan.  Diaz is a far better striker and Parisyan is better at takedowns and throws.  This turns out to be quite an impressive battle, with wonderful moments of intricate technique being employed by both fighters.  These two are a great matchup and I would actually like to see them fight again in the future.  As they are both extremely young, this may be likely to happen.

Chris Lytle continues looking good against Ron Jhun - and Justin Eilers treats Mike Kyle how I feel he needs to be treated.  There is just something so very irritating about Mike Kyle...  Great punch by Eilers.  Thank you.

The bout between Matt Lindland and David Terrell is over in the blink of an eye... Do we have a new force in the UFC?

Next up, Chuck Liddell v. Vernon White.  ""Tiger"" White does far better than I expected in this fight, but ultimately he falls, as so many do before Liddell. Joe Doerksen and Joe Riggs are both good fighters and they have a decent fight where Riggs displays good strength and strikes, but either are serious contenders for the championship, in my opinion.

The main event is controlled throughout by Randy Couture.  There is a cut caused by a headbutt, which makes it a bloody battle.  Very entertaining and almost frustrating to watch.

As always, there are good bonus features made up of behind-the-scenes footage.",1142899200,6,1646,4.699300699300699
8030617,5,B0002Q9VRA,"Man oh man was this a fun event to watch! The main event was great to see... and the fights leading up to it were extremely entertaining as well. The one thing that I really miss in the UFC is lightweight fighters. Thompson vs. Edwards is a perfect example of why the UFC needs to bring back this amazing weight class... there are just so many killer fighters at that size. Buy this DVD, it rocks!",1139443200,,397,4.2368421052631575
8030618,5,B0002Q9VRA,"This is my favorite UFC event to date. Only one fights goes to decision, one fight ends in submission, and the rest end with someone being hurt. :)",1111536000,2,147,4.285714285714286
8030619,3,B0002Q9VRA,"This is the first UFC DVD I've ever watched and I've never shelled out the $$ for the PPV UFC matches, but I was intrigued by Spike TV's The Ultimate Fighter reality show, so I rented this.  This review will contain some spoilers, so if you don't want to know who wins some of these bouts, stop right here.

This simply is nowhere near as interesting of a set of fights as the other reviewers claim.  There were a couple of good fights, the best of which was the Chuck Lidell- Vernon White fight, which involved a number of exchanges of really hard punches with a surprising finish.  White bounces back from a couple series of poundings, lands a few good punches and then Lidell looks away from White to his corner, seemingly stunned but looking for advice.  White must have been  daydreaming, because he had the perfect opening with the Iceman looking away, but waited too long.  He swings in and gets a crushing strike to the head from Lidell.  Match over.

The Thompson-Edward bout was very evenly matched and entertaining.  It also features one of the most surprising knockouts you'll see - Yves Edwards, in the course of breaking free from a standing clench, arcs a high roundhouse from a position that I still don't understand how he got his leg up, his shin connects with Thompson's head and out go the lights.

There were several really quick fights, including the Eilers/Kyle fight and the ultra-quick Terrell-Lindland fight, in which rookie David Terrell lands the third punch of the fight, swarms Lindland with about five skull crushers into the mat and boom - 24 seconds into the fight, Terrell has a knockout.  The Jhun/Lytle fight wasn't that short, but the submission hold Lytle had on Jhun was very surprising - even replaying in 1/8 speed, I never saw the tapout by Jhun, it happened so fast.

The Diaz/Parysian fight ended in a decision, was a very competitive fight and the better fighter won.  However, it was really pretty boring.  The reason it was boring was that it was essentially down on the mat with plenty of wrestling or jujitsu style moves and countermoves (and very skillfully done) but the end result was little actual excitement - few kicks or strikes of any sort.  Now I don't criticize the excitement level of this in ignorance - I've got two varsity letters in wrestling from high school and I roomed in college with an All-American wrestler, so I have a pretty good appreciation of what's happening down on the matt.  I'm not knocking the skills, just the lack of any big moves or strikes, which I find the most exciting.  Neither fighter received a single blow that did any damage in the whole match.

The main event fight - Couture vs. Belfort, was in some ways similar, with almost no kicks or standing strikes, but was an extremely uninteresting, bloody matt-grinding session.  For three rounds, Couture locked up with Belfort, threw him down against the fence, and began a very slow, methodical process of pulverizing Belfort.  It was a highly effective strategy for Couture, but I'd rather watch soccer or the WNBA; you'd be hard pressed to show that outspoken sports radio/TV host Jim Rome likes either sport less than I do.  Couture very skillfully kept Belfort on the mat, smothered him, and began chipping away at him landing a short, 1/8 swing punch on Belfort every 10 seconds or so.  Then, Couture began alternating forearm chops into Belfort's head.  Fairly early on, Couture opened up a big cut over Belfort's eye with an accidental headbutt and the blood flowed everywhere.  Couture won the fight by essentially pinning Belfort close and still on his back and landing many very short punches - almost nothing involving Couture's fist or arm moving more than about 8-10 inches.  By the third round, Couture's white shorts were nearly a solid dark pink from all of Belfort's smeared blood and the ringside doctor stopped the fight during the break after round three, apparently because Belfort's cut had opened up too badly.  Belfort wasn't doing very much and probably had only one offensive move for each minute he was pinned on his back, but he wasn't on the on the very edge of being knocked out.  The knockout probably would have happened by the end of the fourth round, but this was definitely a TKO.  Again, it was a smart fight for Couture and he finished it almost unscathed, but watching fourteen minutes of one guy straddling another, heads mostly touching, and short little punches and chops opening up a bloody cut in the forehead wasn't even slightly interesting to me.  I watched the ending of most of these fights several times, but didn't feel any need to see Couture methodically grinding his way to the championship belt more than once.

In summary, it was definitely worth the rental fee, but I wouldn't buy the DVD unless you are an UFC fanatic.",1107302400,6,4817,4.726076555023924
8030620,5,B0002Q9VRA,"This UFC was well worth the money, almost every single fight ended by K.O., the Belfort vs. Cotoure fight was worth the price of admission, but the rest of this DVD was just completly off the hook. Hands down the best UFC to come out in years.",1103155200,2,243,4.191489361702128
8030621,5,B0002Q9VRA,"One of the UFC's best shows. Only one fight goes the distance and there are tons of KO's, most of them pretty quick too.  It's simply a must see.",1097107200,3,145,4.0
8030622,5,B0002Q9VRA,"First of all, this event was very good to watch on PPV and will likeyl be very exciting when you can rewatch any one of the many knockouts at this event.

The fights were great!

Diaz/Parysian: Great, technical fight, the only one of the night to go the distance with a GOOD decision in Las Vegas for once.

Thompson/Edwards: Good match starting as very technical but moving to a knockout that is being considered the BEST ever highkick knockout.

Eilers/Kyle: Short, but with a clear knockout.

Jhun/Lytle: Only submission of the night but with alot of action before the end.

Terrell/Lindland: WOW! The upset of the year. A quick knockout with bruatl Ground and Pound.

Riggs/Doerkson: Very good fight ending with a very brutal ground and pound attack.

Liddell/White: The stand up war that everyone anticipated happened ending with a good knockout and a very clear picture of who is the number one contender for the light heavy weight championship

Belfort/Couture: Very one sided match that ends due to controversy over a headbutt. This time around though, a clear advantage went to one of the fighters. The better man won, this night.

Overall, a great show!",1095552000,7,1163,4.887755102040816
