5580192,5,B00BD5GGI6,"It is unpalatable to see the volatile nature of what suppose to be human beings, when decisions of their fellowman is not approved by them. It is doubly hard to understand why someone else's choices is taken so personally. It appears that most racism, prejudices, violence and corruption, enacted, is prefixed by the word ""Christian.""

5580193,5,B00BD5GGI6,"The first time I had heard about Mr. & Mrs. Loving was back in 1969. There are many mixed raced couples in this country (all over the world) and it is no surprise to me how racist the attitudes of some American's still exist. Now that I have a copy of it dvd I will be happy to share it with friends who have not heard about The Lovings and their struggle for equality and the right to love and marry the man/woman of their choice and to raise their family. There are so many good things about being an American even if it means you have to look the adverse ugliness about it's past in the face. There are many things that have not changed about our country and it's culture, we just have to be a little more diligent about understanding why racism is so demeaning, degrading, and unpleasant. It may not your choice but don't begrudge others and make it a crime to love someone who isn't like you or share your feelings, views, or opinions. Life is too short for harboring ill feelings, thoughts, and opinions. In January 2012 when HBO aired The Loving Story I was so happy that someone finally decided it was time to put their story this piece of history out in the open for all to see. Enjoy the documentary, it will touch your heart--I promise you.",1364860800,41,1251,4.305084745762712

5580195,5,B00BD5GGI6,"This is one of the most beautiful stories ever told. It's almost Biblical in its content. It is a shame that there are people who have used this beautiful story as a foundation with which to argue their own ideas and beliefs. Everything about the Loving story is beautiful, yet many people using this lovely story to justify their ideas do not understand the nature of love. There are those of us who know and believe that God is love and everything about the love within the Loving Story is Godly. Now watch Amazon reject this review when there were many reviewers using their review of the Loving Story to stand on a soapbox and preach their ideas.",1502409600,,650,4.516949152542373

5580215,5,B00BD5GGI6,"Even though the brief description of this film states that it is a documentary, many reviewers disliked it because they had expected a movie and therefore gave it a low rating.  So that more viewers can avoid being disappointed and the ratings for this film are given fair consideration, I'll just say that this is a DOCUMENTARY.  I appreciated that it contained almost all original footage from the time this case was being heard in the courts as this helped to envelop us securely in that time.  The original footage also helped to deliver the punch of learning that the last state to leave off the unconstitutionality of prohibiting interracial marriages was in 2000.  It was a thrill to hear the Supreme Court deliver its ruling.  Courageous people, devoted lawyers and a Supreme Court at its best.  9-0.",1487462400,6,808,4.818840579710145

5580223,5,B00BD5GGI6,"A truly inspiring story of love triumphing over hatred.  The question I would like to ask is this: Why does the children of Jephthah hate the children of Shem and Ham so much.  Is it jealousy? Why are they so jealous.  Have they not got the same heavenly father? I use to believe there was something wrong with us as black people but I now realise that the white nation rejection of us is not because there is something wrong with us but the reverse.  Many white people (thank God not all) hate black people for no apparent reason at all.  If you ask many white people why do they hate black people so much they cannot give you a logical answer.  Most will say they just don't know.  I think that many white people who find themselves in this situation should ask themselves, why on earth do I hate black people.  Is this hatred that  I feel for black people rational?  Is hatred from God? What have black people done to me to warrant this hatred that I have towards them.  If they cannot answer these questions and confirm it in the words of God whom they profess to love, then they have allowed Satan to use them as a tool to do his evil work without their resistant.  Time is short.  We will all stand before the judgement seat of God and will all have to give an account of our actions towards  our fellow human beings, both black and white  whilst here on earth.  For those of you who hate black people,  what will your response be?  This is worth considering before it is too late.",1485561600,,1487,4.268817204301075

The film also has recordings of the actual Supreme Court oral argument.  To hear the government use word for word the same arguments to support a ban on interracial marriage as it did to argue in favor of the ban in gay marriage , is stunning and shows the nonsense of the argument. The court concluded in Loving that :"" The decision to marry, or not marry, a person of a different race, rests with the individual and the government cannot infringe on it .""  Same result for gay marriage.  Great film.",1483574400,3,672,4.677966101694915

One quickly realizes the same identical arguments used against Marriage Equality were used against Inter-racial couples.  They used children as a wedge -- while some of those children would one day become adults who wanted to marry the person they love - either an interracial or same-sex spouse. .  I never really understood the impact of those ridiculous laws until I saw a true story.  I just knew of the law.

5580314,5,B00BD5GGI6,"The Lovings were very private people, to put it mildly, but their lawyers convinced them it would help their court case if they got some positive P.R. So they participated in some interviews with TV news reporters and Nancy Buirski uses all that footage to great effect. Richard is every bit as taciturn as advertised, but Mildred is the real revelation here. She's obviously quiet and shy, but she's also refined and elegant and graceful and she comes across as sort of a backwoods Jackie Kennedy. It looks like she took this publicity effort to heart and used it to present the Lovings' case to the court of public opinion in general and the U.S. Supreme Court in particular. The most moving segment is when a reporter asks Mildred what they will do if they lose their case. Mildred responds softly that they will have to move back to D.C., then she grows silent and casts her eyes downward, totally lost in thought. Mildred was a country girl, and that may be difficult for city and town people to understand, but some of us could definitely sympathize with how she was feeling at that moment. City living clearly did not suit the Lovings in any way, shape, or form. Anyway, Nancy Buirski and her crew have done some very good work here.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not automatically rewrite the discriminatory laws in each state.....they had to be challenged. It's disappointing how ""upstanding"" citizens like judges and police still believed in those laws and enforced them.

The Lovings, Mildred and Richard, a compelling couple with children who get caught up in a cause to overturn a law that banishes mixed-race marriages in their home State of Virginia; they had no idea this law existed at the time.  They became civil rights activists by default; they were victims of the times in Virginia.  Segregationists tried to break up their marriage... it was a 9 year fight in the courts, but they won the right to remain married as a mixed-couple and go back home to Virginia living along side their families and friends.  The law against interracial marriages was deemed illegal and reversed in Virginia and a few other States.  The Lovings made history!

Part of what makes the documentary so moving is how ordinary, how camera shy, and how 'real' these people were.  They weren't looking to be heroes, they just wanted to be able to live where they wanted with the person they loved.  It makes one think of how many important moments in history involve not politicians, or the powerful, or those with outsized personalities, but regular folks simply trying to be themselves. (Rosa Parks springs to mind).  Whats also touching is how effective this film is as a love story.  These two quiet people had every obstacle thrown in their way.

5580390,5,B00BD5GGI6,"Really lovely, different people. Obviously deeply in love after a decade of marriage. Great window into how things were even only 2 generations ago. Not only with civil rights but how people lived. Mrs. Loving is a lovely, bright, and gentle spirit. The affectionate love between the couple and with their  beautiful carefree children is wonderful. (it seems clear they are great parents). They lived in this cool Southern town where cross race relations were accepted much more than in other places (even maybe in the north at the time)

They are/were Everyman (person) and the perfect epitome why the law that punished them was so unjust. I really liked this film and the couple. Sadly Mr. Loving was killed within a decade in a car accident, but I am glad they had their time together. We all should know this kind of love

It's amazing that this couple was the one that ended up challenging the law. Not only their name (amazing!) but their relationship being so obviously and naturally soulmates it seemed. And their humble unassuming circumstances.

Mr. Loving amusingly to that point looks like (and has! he's fair and works outside) a redneck. A side note is how much older he looks than he is. Notice he's only in his early 30s here looks in mid 40s at least. Smoking and sun. Anyway nice slice of life from that era, nice for me personally because it was only a few yrs before I was born but the time I can remember things the word was different, at least in the north where I am",1406592000,4,1489,4.5655430711610485

5580393,4,B00BD5GGI6,"A moving, refreshing story. I study Loving v Virginia in law school. The movie followed very closely. The lovings only wanted the right to be together near their families. Then they took care of themselves.",1399420800,,206,4.914285714285715

5580396,5,B00BD5GGI6,This documentary on race relations in the state of VA is AWESOME!!!  Mr. Richard Loving loved his wife/family.  Will watch this over and over.  Classic.,1398384000,,152,5.0
5580397,5,B00BD5GGI6,"I was a little girl when this story unfolded, but I do remember how hard it was back then to just live where you want and love whomever you wished...I am white but my father married my stepmother (black) in the mid-sixties. We were in California, where it wasn't illegal, per se, but there was a kind of de facto segregation which made life very difficult...people cannot even imagine now how bad it really was.
When I bought a house in 2001 there was something on the deed which stated that only whites could own the home--or even sleep there overnight.
There are also parallels with the gay marriage struggle going on right now.  In 50 years (or less) people will be shaking their heads-",1398124800,55,689,4.512
5580398,5,B00BD5GGI6,"This documentary has personal relevance to me.  As part of an interracial couple married in 1967 I understand the issue very well. But in my case there was legal support (ie legal in the state of California) but not community support as with the Lovings.
I think the other reviews I have read missed what, for me, is the central core of this film.  These two loved each other in a quiet, deep and solid way.  I have never seen anything like it!  Mr Loving appears as your classic 'redneck' yet he is unashamed to express his love for his wife.  I am in admiration.  No bells and whistles but isn't this the lasting romance that we all would like to experience?",1397088000,3,660,4.368852459016393
5580399,5,B00BD5GGI6,"I do not think I have ever seen a better documentary, one that has better caught & held my interest. I was especially impressed by Mrs. Loving as a person. Who she was, was very well communicated. Perhaps it was because the director was a women helped the the sensitive handling of the subject matter & those involved. Kudos to all on this one!",1396656000,2,344,4.390625
5580400,5,B00BD5GGI6,This is very enlightening  about the law and the struggle to have all the same rights as everyone else has to marry whom ever they choose. This is around 1964-1968 the fight for a white man and a black woman to be legally married in Virginia. Sounds very much like the current fight for all gays and lesbians to have their marriages legally recognized.,1395100800,2,352,4.5
5580401,5,B00BD5GGI6,"A sobering look at the history of segregation fro a marital point of view. What was poignant about the film was the stance of this couple, Richard, who is white, and Mildred, who is black, and clearly in love with each other despite the segregation laws of the state of Virginia. They are arrested, and what seems to an open and closed case, goes all the way to the Supreme Court where the decision of the Court will strike down Virginia's Racial Integrity Laws forever.",1394323200,3,470,4.541176470588235
5580402,5,B00BD5GGI6,"This is truly a beautiful love story.

5580405,5,B00BD5GGI6,This is an outstanding and emotional story that says quite bit our history on race relations in the United States. This couple did not expect to be catapulted into history this way - they were just trying to live their lives. In just trying to live their lives they changed the course of history - what a story!!!!,1383264000,6,314,4.431034482758621
5580406,5,B00BD5GGI6,Unfortuneately the viewer will see the ugly side of human kind. This documentary inspired me. I wish I could purchase it on dvd to give as presents.,1380672000,3,148,4.518518518518518
5580407,4,B00BD5GGI6,"Maybe this wasn't the world's most well done documentary, but it's a touching story about how interracial marriage was legalized in all 50 states. Honest and poignant, I grew to like and admire the everyday people behind this great love story. Highly recommended!",1377561600,23,263,5.1395348837209305
5580408,5,B00BD5GGI6,I had seen and heard bit's and pieces of the Loving's story but this documentary brought their story to life. The DVD contained more information about their legal battle but I would have liked more details about the family in later years.,1377302400,9,238,4.690476190476191
5580409,5,B00BD5GGI6,"I am a 76 year old male and for rhe first time in my life I can now understand what life must of been like for my parents in Alabama.
My father was German and Native American and my mother Native American and African American. I was very touched by the story and it was like watching the history of my family. I believe there are many familes that can relate to THE LOVING STORY which is an American tragedy and awe inspiring heroes that lived during this time of history.
A well told story of two people in love that stood for their equality to love each other and the right to marry. Sounds like today's fight to marry the person you love.",1373500800,81,641,4.17741935483871
5580410,5,B00BD5GGI6,"While I have admired what this couple did for the freedoms many of us now enjoy, I really had not known any of the real life aspects of their struggle. This film gave us a glimpse into their lives and I so appreciate that. I showed it to 25 people yesterday to honor Loving Day.  Everyone was moved by it. Young children watched it too. The youngest had to have popcorn to help sit still. It is a joy to be able to share this with others.",1372550400,4,438,4.0344827586206895
5580411,5,B00BD5GGI6,"This is the documentary accompaniment to ""Mr. and Mrs. Loving,"" the drama starring Timothy Hutton.  Together the two films bring out the profound story of two quiet people who didn't think it was right that they couldn't be married. Their resistance was so personal it was almost invisible, but the laws barring interracial marriage were struck down across the country by a federal court because of them. This is history. Don't pass it by.",1371945600,4,439,4.9324324324324325
5580412,4,B00BD5GGI6,"Rather than rehash what my fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has said in detailing the story which this brief (77-minute) film covers, I'll suggest, up front, that you read K's review. I had the same feeling when watching this film. It's historically importan - this was a landmark case during the civil rights era of the 1960s, one not usually covered. But the personalities of the major characters make even the 77 minutes seem long. I'm a huge documentary fan but this one just didn't grab me. For those interested in the cilvil rights movement - or human rights in general - this is worth watching. It just could have been better.

The film was shown on HBO and the DVD contains no special (bonus) features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
