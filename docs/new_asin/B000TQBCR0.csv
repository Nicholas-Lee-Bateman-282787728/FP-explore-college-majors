8210334,5,B000TQBCR0,"I lived in the Philippines as a Navy Junior at Sangley Point NAS in the mid 1950's. I and many others took the boat across Manila Bay every morning to attend the American School. Peter Parsons, a fellow classmate, is an alumnus of the school and the movie he produced is about his famous father Chick Parsons who help organize the resistance guerillas who hid in the mountains and reeked havoc on the Japanese invaders. Not only was he instrumental in the organization  of the resistance but he was also an astute businessman before and after the war.

This is a world class documentary and not to be missed if you have interests in the Philippines and the invasion by the Japanese during World War II.",1250208000,,702,4.563492063492063
