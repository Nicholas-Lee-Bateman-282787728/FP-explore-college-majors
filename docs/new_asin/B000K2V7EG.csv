2682021,5,B000K2V7EG,"This movie was great, it continues where Third Man Out left out.  The story line was not predictable at all and the movie had me glued to the television the whole time.  Cannot wait until the next one is out!",1173225600,2,208,4.175
2682022,4,B000K2V7EG,"I really wanted to like ""Third Man Out"" more than I did.  It had all the makings of a fine movie, but I felt it was a little forced, a little scattered, and the story didn't hold up terribly well.

I am happy to say that ""Shock"" is a really fine movie and a vast improvement over ""System.""  It preserves the continuity of the Strachey character, and we get a new murder mystery, tons more back story, and a much more natural-feeling, interesting, and thoughtful feel for the relationship between Strachey and his partner.

Along with some chuckles and inside jokes, there is real feeling here, and this film takes some chances.  It deals with coming out, self-identity, parenting, and more.  Mr. Strachey's investigation takes him inside a gay conversion group, or ""ex-gay"" group, and the film is thoughtful and deals respectfully with all the characters.

Of course Chad Allen is the best part of this movie, and seems born, almost, for the role which he pulls off, somehow, conveying feelings and emotions with barely a perceptible change of expression.

This film is worth seeing, enjoying, and thinking about.  I look forward to the next installment of the Allen/Stratchey series.",1172448000,4,1184,4.88
2682023,4,B000K2V7EG,"Richard Stevenson's gay mystery novels based on his creation of Donald Strachey, Private Investigator have found the perfect crew to transform these very interesting and entertaining stories to film.  SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM is the second in the series and as adapted for the screen by Ron McGee, directed with panache by Ron Oliver, and starring the very fine actor Chad Allen as the sleuth with couth and style and charisma the results are a polished little gem of a film. But aside from the fact that the film is so well put together, it presents gay people in roles that are so far away from the usual stereotypical types that their sexual proclivity is in many ways simply incidental: you have to look long and hard to find a solid healthy gay relationship as well portrayed as that between Strachey and his life partner Tim (the very fine Sebastian Spence).

The story this time around involves Strachey's being asked to help one Paul Hale (Jared Keeso), the supposed poster boy for the Phoenix Foundation, a 'turn gay people straight' institute run by Dr. Trevor Cornell (Michael Woods) and his wife Lynn (Anne Marie Loder).  Paul is soon found dead and the implications are suicide.  But Strachey suspects foul play (we later discover Hale was his first love in the Army!) and aided by Hale's mother Phyllis (Morgan Fairchild looking terrific and acting well) who encouraged her son's joining the Phoenix Foundation, he begins his own style of investigation.

Strachey wisely 'becomes a patient' with Dr. Cornell and in group therapy makes discoveries and friends with those who eventually help to solve the case: a strong group of actors including Rikki Gagne, Stephen Huszar, Ryan Kennedy, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, Shawn Roberts, Dany Papineau, and Gerry Morton. The clues are laid out, the deaths follow and the truths finally surface.  And all the while Strachey is supported by Tim, by a very fine comic actor Nelson Wong as his 'office manager', and by his 'boss' Detective Bailey (Daryl Shuttleworth).

The dialogue is crisp, relevant, intense when it needs to be and funny when it relaxes, the cinematography takes a beautiful bow to the old Hollywood film noir techniques, and the cast is excellent, filled with not only a lot of eye candy but also with some very well realized characterizations. In the end the film belongs to the very hunky and versatile Chad Allen, only making wait for the next installment in this very successful series!  Highly recommended for all audiences.

2682024,3,B000K2V7EG,"This second gay-noir Strachey film has much of the wonderful style and archness of the first. This film is less successful than the first because of egregious plotting problems. One wishes to take the plot seriously, but a character who ""cannot afford to be seen"" with Strachey meets with him in the night in the middle of the street totally backlit. This is great for the camera, but is not how someone in hiding would do it. Of course, making a perfect target, a car tries to run them over. Much worse is when Strachey and a film student come under attack; the electric power goes off. In violation of any good sense, Strachey leaves the other guy to go into the hall, yelling, ""Identify yourself"" to the air, and allowing the other guy to get shot. Hasn't Strachey seen any movies? And, how many times does Strachey have to get into his car and have some one hiding in the back seat put a gun to his head? Cannot he learn to lock his car, and to look in the back seat before entering? This Strachey is too dumb to survive.",1171756800,4,1025,4.34375
2682025,5,B000K2V7EG,"I find the Donald Strachey series immensely enjoyable and fun to watch. The series has dealt with two prevalent issues in the gay community at the moment...hypocrisy among the religious right with Third Man Out and gay regenerative therapy with Shock to the System. It's nice to watch films that address these topics but doesn't put them into the context of preaching.

The story addresses a young man who is in need of Strachey's help in finding someone (a nice little twist @ the end as to exactly whom that is).  As usual, he winds up dead before Strachey knows who it is and must go undercover in a clinic that specializes in ""curing"" homosexuals.  Morgan Fairchild makes a brief but touching turn as the dead man's mother...I wish she had been given more screen time.  She managed to make a mother who pushes her son into regenerative therapy because of his ""issues"" seem loving and delusional at the same time.

I also like the noir touches (some find it amateurish because the colors are bleached out but it's obviously a predictable component to the film, i.e., it's supposed to look like that).

Chad Allen is a fantastic actor and he imbues the Strachey character with darkness, a sense of humor and a humility and humanness that is so often missing in trite, gay characters. Sebastian Spence as his husband Timmy Callahan is also great and I love the chemistry between Chad and Sebastian as they bring this relationship to life. This is one of the most honest and moving gay relationships ever depicted and it comes without all the clichs. These two men LOVE each other greatly and it shows and it's a NORMAL relationship. It's one of the best facets of these films.

And so what that the mysteries are predictable! Murder She Wrote, Matlock, Columbo, Perry Mason, etc. were all predictable ""mysteries"" that were solved in the first 3 minutes; however, it never made them any less enjoyable. It's fun to watch the chase; that's the whole point.

I will continue to watch for more of these movies and I am delighted that there are seven in the works. These are popcorn, fun movies with great casts, engaging stories and a wonderful depiction of gay love and relationships.",1171497600,24,2182,4.708661417322834
2682026,5,B000K2V7EG,"This is a well-plotted, superbly cast follow up to the first Donald Strachey film, ""Third Man Out."" I personally found the subject matter---sexual ""healing"" for gays---more engrossing than the ""outing"" theme of the first film. Once again, Chad Allen is fascinating as the macho gay detective. And his back story---he's an ex-soldier who was drummed out of the service for being gay---more ably serves the screenplay this time around. The regulars all seem more comfortable in their roles, and it's nice to see Nelson Wong returning as Donald's secretary. Morgan Fairchild appears in a rather thankless cameo, and, although Sebastian Spence is a little less ditsy as Donald's lawyer boyfriend (Nora to Allen's Nick), Timmy, Allen's banter with Daryl Shuttleworth, as Detective Bub Bailey, and the other guys at the precinct is more fun. It's a first-class production, with director Ron Oliver making all the right moves, and Allen's acting is nothing short of brilliant: he does Emmy-caliber work (as he did Oscar-calibre work in ""End of the Spear"") in a surprisingly literate script.",1170979200,42,1083,5.2298850574712645
2682027,5,B000K2V7EG,"When I watched ""Shock to the System"" on HERE! I did it based on a friend's recommendation.  I really didn't know what to expect.  What I saw was a kick-[..] detective story with superb production values.  Then, in checking out Chad Allen, I found out there was another Strachy movie ""Third Man Out"".  You'll be smart to order them together.  You won't be disappointed.  This should be a weekly hour series on cable TV!",1170288000,14,418,4.581081081081081
2682028,4,B000K2V7EG,"Shock to the System is the second in a series of adaptations of Richard Stevenson's novels depicting gay private investigator Donald Strachy.  When not solving problems in the Albany, NY, area, Strachy goes home to his partner, Timothy Callahan, a staff assistant to a state senator and former seminary student.

The film starts similarly to the novel.  Paul Hale hires Strachy (Chad Allen) to find an unidentified person but is shortly found dead of a drug and alcohol overdose.  Hale had recently made a scene at a gay-conversion therapy session, angering the leader, Dr. Trevor Cornell (Michael Woods), and had left the group.  There are indications that Hale was about to make damaging public revelations about the gay-conversion organization.

Identifying some with Hale, Strachy infiltrates the group and pokes around.  The issues raised at the group raise up old memories for Strachy, which lead to an emotional scene between Strachy and Callahan (Sebastian Spence), giving more depth to Strachy and to his partnership.  Kenny Kwon (Nelson Wong), a desk clerk in the first film, Third Man Out, finds a new role in this one, lightening the mood.  The film goes on to its conclusion.

The movie succeeds in providing character and noir atmosphere.  We see the principals in more depth than in the novels.  There is no issue of being too campy.  The lighting, costumes, and sets are great.

Getting all that to work in 91 minutes did cause big chunks of the novel to drop out of the script.  There is no more group prank against the group leader and far fewer individual interviews.  The solution of the mystery is very compressed.  It's a bit of a shame since I thought the underlying novel was the best at showcasing Strachy's sleuthing skills of the whole series.  Given future films, there may well be future payoff for building characters now.

The skin shots are somewhat scaled back from the first film but still plentiful.  There is a locker room scene, with one important character making difficulties for Strachy,  two sports scenes, and there are a few discrete scenes between Strachy and Callahan.

For me the big payoff is that a successful gay detective novel series has found a sympathetic producer, director, and cast willing to make a reasonably adapted series of high quality at an acceptable cost.  I thank the producers and the rest for taking the chance and congratulate them for succeeding.

While other gay detective novel series may lack the easy comfort of  Stevenson's pairing of Strachy and Callahan.  (The director compares them to Nick and Nora Charles of the Thin Man series.  The Sherlock Holmes series with Jeremy Brett and David Burke/ Edward Hardwicke makes an interesting comparison too.), I can envision a successful run of similarly adapted and budgeted films for Joseph Hanson's Dave Brandstetter, Dorien Grey's Dick Hardesty, Michael Nava's Henry Rios, John Morgan Wilson's Benjamin Justice (maybe  Chad Allen again), or Josh Lanyon's Adrien English.  How about it?",1170201600,17,3008,5.032388663967612
2682029,4,B000K2V7EG,"While this film is not without flaws, I found it entertaining and believable.

The second in the Donald Strachey Mysteries tv-movie series.
Directed by Ron Oliver. Written by Ron McGee. Original Music by Peter Allen.
Chad Allen returns as ""Donald Strachey"". Daryl Shuttleworth, Nelson Wong, Sibel Thrasher also return.

Our gay Private Investigator Donald Strachey (Chad Allen) meets his client in a foggy, cold alley. Paul Hale (Jared Keeso) would have rather done this over the phone. Donald explains he prefers to meet his clients face to face. Clearly, Paul is very worried and scared and doesn't know whether to trust Donald or not. Suddenly, a vehicle comes into the alley and finds Paul with Donald and drives to them. Paul quickly gives Donald a check for $5,000, as a retainer and tells him to take it. Donald leaps out of the way of the vehicle just in time and slams into a brick wall. Paul wants him to track down someone.

2682048,5,B000K2V7EG,"Aside from this movie's witty ""riff"" on Films Noir (deliberately, campily dark 1940's mystery flicks), its really high production values, and unexpectedly Deep and sensitive acting (especially by Chad Allen, but the entire cast was GREAT) - here we are given a STORY with a loveable, complex and human GAY COUPLE, who are in love and living (comparatively) normal lives. They're not tortured or hustlers or sexaholics or dying of a horrible disease, nor are they stupidly campy, queeny or butched out (all annoying gay stereotypes perpetrated for FAR too long even by many ""gay"" movies themselves). And, as the fascinating (main) detective story plays itself out, the foreground shifts to the back story of one of the two gay ""married"" guys - where we, and his partner, see someone very brave, manfully facing and escaping his past and thereby becoming freer. THAT is wonderful, as is the fact that at last we have a movie about gay people and gay couples which is not BY DEFINITION sad, limited and ""doomed."" In contrast, I LOATHED Brokeback Mountain, because it totally reinforced that ""inevitable"" doom of gay love - that perpetrated by such a PRETTY Ang Lee package, probably all to make middle class straight audiences of the time feel all comfy and ""sympathetic,"" but in reality reinforcing condescension and division, while making big bucks from pretending to do ""ain't it awful."" And Brokeback was supposedly the so-called ""best"" film we saw about gay love in decades. UGH! However, if you want to see a movie that IS fun, clever, well-filmed, well-acted and outside that horrific box - and which also is the FIRST ONE ABOUT being gay and a gay couple as NORMAL, liberating and hopeful - well buy ""Shock."" It came out just a HAIR too soon to go mainstream. Hopefully it WILL do so later, as more and more fearful and inexperienced-with-LGBT people /straight people get to know ""us"" and then realize with us how ridiculously tragic gay history has been.

The film adaptations of Richard Stevenson's novels about a gay private detective in Albany, New York are all around well done. The screenplays are well written and the acting is everything from wonderfully understated (Daryl Shuttleworth's Sean 'Bub' Bailey) to loving overacted (the Drag Queen seen in short appearances in both Third Man Out and again here in Shock To The System).

Donald (Chad Allen of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman fame) and his life partner, Tim Callahan (Sebastian Spence, an under-appreciated Canadian actor best known for B-movies and his role as Cade Foster in First Wave), have been called the gay Nick and Nora Charles. Their witty repartee and loving exchanges make watching any scene with the two of them a real treat.

Rather than risk spoilers I will simply say that this installment to the Strachey Library deals with death, reparative therapy and of course, Donald getting ambushed by clients' irate cheating spouses whom he has exposed. I recommend the Donald Strachey movies to anyone who loves the 'hard-boiled Detective' genre or any fan of Chad Allen, Here! Network or LGBTQ themed films.",1312329600,,1266,5.023809523809524

After a young client he agrees to represent turns up dead, Strachey goes undercover as a patient to infiltrate a gay conversion therapy organization whose methods are often questionable. The deeper Strachey immerses himself in the case, the more that case reflects what is happening in his personal life. As Strachey asks himself ""What would life be like if I weren't gay?"" & then asks his partner Tim the same question, a rift develops in their relationship. In a tender moment, Strachey reveals the pain he went through in the military when him & his first love are caught & court martialed to Tim. It's a powerful, humanizing moment for the Strachey character.
The script, this time around, is an improvement over ""Third Man Out"". And the cast is terrific: Chad Allen mines more depth as Strachey; Sebastian Spence gives a bit more depth (and less annoyance) as Tim Callahan; Morgan Fairchild gives a startling fine performance as the grieving mother; and Nelson Wong is a welcome addition to the cast as Kenny Kwon, ""office manager"" for Strachey, adding some comedy relief in banter & his dysfunctional sexual relationships.

I had no idea that Albany was so gay-friendly but that the gays there get involved in so much trouble. Glad I live in California. Anyway...

Kudos to all involved in this project for portraying a realistic, functional, sane, happy gay couple, one of whom has the traditionally ""macho"" job of P.I and who stays out of politics and just does his job. The odd political point is made here and there but for the most part it is just a classic detective film which makes a much stronger point than anything they could possibly say explicitly in the film.

Highly recommended as a concept worthy of being watched on film; especially to younger gay men who need reassurance of their masculinity as so many of them do.",1252281600,2,1260,4.541850220264317
2682059,3,B000K2V7EG,"This was a good movie. This was a good mystery. This was not an ""In your face. I am gay. Hear me roar"" movie. Chad Allen did an excellent, believable job.  Those of the opposing view were not demonized. Actually they were humanized, which is rare for Hollywood, as most people who do not share the ""pro-gay"" view are characterized as religious nuts, zealots, freaks or malicious homophobes. There was something missing though that would not allow this to be a "" major motion picture movie"". It felt more like a weekly series. And a good one it would be. With the exception of one character, the actors did  a great job of playing ""gay"" , but not over doing it. Often when straight actors play gay, they force the character and over compensate. Not so in this mystery. Yes, this movie has an agenda, but I enjoyed the action, mystery and plot so much that the agenda was secondary. A good movie.",1236384000,2,894,4.478527607361963
2682060,5,B000K2V7EG,"I saw a three minute fan video of this little movie that I had never heard of.  Now I am writing a review?  What happened?  I went to Amazon, bought the two movies that I could (Hopefully the next two produced in 2008 will be on AMAZON shortly) and I have been enjoying them every since.

For a lot of fans of the movies, I think the mystery is almost incidental.  We just love the characters and the relationships.  There is humor and wonderful light moments, especially between the two leads, but there are moments of quiet gentleness and soul searching and sorrow and that is just as satisfying to watch.

The extras on the DVD are worth watching, too. I would have loved a blooper/gag reel, but I can't really complain.",1226793600,2,723,4.431818181818182

Granted it is not a huge budget big screen oscar contender, but very well acted and a good story line. Like in a lot of movies there are some performances that are just not fleshed out or believable and this movie is no exception. Good news is that the main characters performances are all good reasons for buying the movie. Chad Allen is very easy on the eyes and also gives a top rate performance and proves to be every bit the leading man. ( I just wished costuming would get suits that fit him better) It was good to see Morgan Fairchild, and she still looks phenominal.

Fortunately, thanks primarily to very competent acting it improves to the level of an above average TV movie (tho not on Showtime or HBO) with a gay hero. The suspense is pretty good, the plot not especially predictable, and the pacing quite effective.

It gets three stars because there's no 2.5 on the scale.",1200700800,4,404,4.597222222222222

2682069,4,B000K2V7EG,"Albany's gay private eye Donald Strachey is back after his initial appearance in ""Third Man Out"" in another cable television production. The murder victims and most of the witnesses are good looking, ripped guys. The story revolves around a doctor who runs a gay reparative program called Phoenix. He says his patients should ""live a life not a lifestyle"" and that being gay is a choice.
 The detective has an idyllic love affair with his Clark Kentish looking lawyer lover. (You know there's a good bod under that suit.) This film goes into Strachey's army background with a lover and through flashbacks helps to flesh out the character more than the first episode did.
 It's fairly well done with good action sequences, some humor, beefcake, competent acting, a melodramatic flavor and some grandstanding about the importance of being true gay. There are worse ways to kill ninety minutes than watching this flick.",1192665600,2,916,5.019736842105263

2682080,5,B000K2V7EG,"""Shock to the System"" is a splendid Mystery/Detective presentation that is splendidly acted and directed.  As a follow-up to ""Third Man Out"" it certainly answers some questions that I had while viewing ""Third Man Out"" (e.g., what is Starchey's ""story"" before he became a Detective?--a soldier that fell in love with another soldier and suffered the ramifications thereof)

The casting in this film is superb.  Chad Allen is so very great as Detective Donald Starchey and so is Sebastian Spence as his partner.  They are very believable as a very contented and happy couple.  Morgan  Fairchild gives a wonderful performance as a rather unhappy mother of the murdered gay son that is trying to blame ""those gays"" for her son's murder.  I'm so very glad that the casting people brought back the little fired hotel Desk Clerk from the first episode as Starchey's office manager; he brings some ""comic relief"" to the story--plus he's ""easy on the eyes""."".(The scene when he first meets Starchey's partner is hysterical.)

 The bottom line is that I truly loved ""Shock to the System""; god, it is so good.

By the way do look at the cast interviews and the director's comments under Special features"" they are very enlightening!",1187136000,2,1221,4.9411764705882355

The plot is well constructed and Chad Allen is quite convincingly strong as the detective.  It's nice to see a detective story where the detective isn't omnipotent.  Why 4 stars?  Hey, I figured the plot twist out before the final reel.

2682084,5,B000K2V7EG,"I loved ""Third Man Out"", the first Donald Strachey Mystery movie and this one is even better. The great thing about ""Shock To The System"" is that the characters are more developed, especially Donald. You get to know him better and in the scene when he tells Timmy about the Army (I can't give details) you feel and cry with him. Chad Allen is a excellent actor but in that particular scene he is simply superb.

I love murder mystery either on film or in books and ""Shock To The System"" is a great film for those like me who love this genre. But what truly caught my heart is Donald and Timmy's relationship... they are adorable together! This movie is MUST for cute-couple-suckers like me... you can't get wrong with these guys!!!",1181606400,5,731,4.496240601503759
2682085,5,B000K2V7EG,"For anyone who has wondered if the movies would change from showing us the stereotypical gay man, here is a set of films that do.  A gay detective embarks on a mission to discover the devious deeds that lead to another mans death.  Yet, this film shows much more than just an interesting plot.  This is the second film in the Donald St. series and gives the audience a more indepth picture to who the hero really is as well as to how he is coming to understand what life is about.  Through this film the protagonist, Det. Don, battles many fears and insecurities all people suffer from, not just a homosexual adience.  He confronts a past that still haunts him and stands in the way of his current relationship as well as deals with the oppressive need to fit.  Something the murder victim was struggling with.

So, if you enjoy a good murder mystery that also allows you to see how human a person can truly be, I highly recomend this film.  You will enjoy the plot as well as charater development and be able to identify with many of the feelings and emotions portrayed within this film.  Of course this is only my opinion, but I can safely say you will not be disapointed with the purchase of this video.",1178928000,8,1206,4.396396396396397
2682086,5,B000K2V7EG,"This is the second movie in the Donald Strachey Mystery series.  It is an improvement on Third Man Out (the first) which also was a thoroughly watchable mystery.

The characters and the storylines are developing well.  There is more background information to show how Strachey became the man he is: loyal, trustworthy, tenacious and attracting trouble like a magnet.  His partner Tim (Sebastian Spence you can put your shoes under my bed at any time:0)), although not as prominent also developed more depth in this installment of the series.  It was like he is settling in for the long haul, relaxing into the role.

I felt the story flowed more easily than Third Man Out and it was a little harder to pick the murderer - although I did by the second murder (but I usually do because I LOVE mysteries).

I don't know if the fact that Chad Allen is actually an out gay man means he brings depth, understanding and a comfortableness to his role but he definitely portrays the character well and shows emotion realistically in the scene where he recounts his first gay relationship experience and the tragic outcome of that.  He seems relaxed and real - which is not an easy thing to do - as Strachey.

I think although being gay oriented, because of the characters, it is not an in your face type of prominence.  It shows being gay is as normal as being blonde - it just is, you can't change it (although ironically the storyline in this movie is centred around this being otherwise).  I like that it is woven into the story showing gay people have real lives, real relationships, real problems and real love.  (Sigh) I love a love story and this fits into that liking as well. It gets to me on a couple of levels which is refreshing - mutli-satisfying.

I am definitely looking forward to the next one.  If they keep developing in depth and quality this will prove to be a must-have series for film buffs, especially those that love the mystery genre.",1178841600,5,1950,4.566091954022989

We just see two people in a loving committed relationship who happen to be gay AND are solving a mystery.  The performances were very good and the Ron Oliver's nod to Film Noire is equally as well done. Personally, I wish the series could have gone on and on but, alas, Chad Allen has left show business and Sebastian Spence has moved on.
