The bad guy of DEAD WEIGHT, Maj. Gen. Martin J. Hollister, tries a new war strategy by seducing, to Columbo's great displeasure, the main witness of the crime he committed. Columbo's mood won't get any better as one of the Hollister's interrogatories takes place in a speeding yacht. Finally, we'll learn a little more about the detective's family in this episode : he's got a sister who, after a first divorce, married a policeman who gave her six children, and his brother-in-law, we don't know yet if he speaks of the policeman here, is an experienced fisherman. DEAD WEIGHT is not the best episode of the serie but is still fun to watch.
