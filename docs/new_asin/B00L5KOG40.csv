6470682,5,B00L5KOG40,It was very helpful.,1481328000,,20,4.25
6470683,4,B00L5KOG40,"Very good tutorial on a knife, the instructor explains the 8 angles of attack but in reality the maechanics it's only 5. Learned something new on this film though. For most part knife fighting is 5 angles of attack and foot work is Usally in ""V"" or ""X"" stepping. If you keep in down to that simplicity it is easy to learn and understand, then again my back ground is the philapino arts of node fighting... Callie and Arnis.",1474416000,,423,4.367088607594937

6470690,5,B00L5KOG40,My other review of this video applies here. Excellent production quality. Great information. Outstanding overall.,1450656000,2,113,6.6
6470691,5,B00L5KOG40,"The videography is very well done, especially considering that a lot of DVDs of this genre look like they were filmed in someone's basement with an old super 8 camera held by a drunk weaving around the room under the light of a flash light. The information imparted by this series of videos is easy to follow and easy to put into practice with a training partner. As a teacher Mr Kanarek has the ability to impart knowledge in a useable manner that the viewer can grasp the first time through the video. Mike takes the time to explain subtle nuance's that might otherwise be missed in the flat 2d world of video. Each chapter gives an over view of what you will learn for each segment and then Mr Kanarek does an excellent job covering the topics in detail. All in all well worth adding to a personal library.",1450569600,6,809,4.4
6470692,5,B00L5KOG40,This series is easy to learn and in my option can be extremely when used. If you would like to learn how to use a knife in combat/defensive situations then look no further. The instructor was a former Israeli Commando and also came out on the TV show Worlds Greatest Warrior or something like that.,1450051200,,298,4.4363636363636365

6470697,5,B00L5KOG40,"This DVD along with the companion DVD of knife combat is great. You can follow along and learn the techniques and drills. You can actually have fun while learning it. Make sure you have a partner to practice with. If you apply some time, patience and persistence, you will be able to implement these into your repertoire. Like other Krav Maga DVDs, it is meant for practically and ease of learning. I highly recommend this DVD and this instructor.",1436659200,6,447,4.670886075949367
6470698,5,B00L5KOG40,"This DVD is great for those of you who are looking to implement tactical knife techniques in your repertoire. This instructor is very good and detailed with his explanation, but not monotonous. You may feel like you have him in front. The drills, techniques and scenarios are fun to follow and you may find they are not only easy to learn, like Krav Maga, but you may find these techniques useful for the unfortunate moment if it occurs. Highly recommend this DVD along with the other knife DVD that goes with it.",1436659200,6,513,4.586956521739131

6470700,5,B00L5KOG40,"No nonsense, straight the business DVDs.  Will you watch these and become an expert knife fighter capable of fighting a Kali master?  No.  Will you watch and practice enough to become lethal against 90% of the morons out there?  HELL YES.  These guys teach the basics and they make it lethal. 100% worth the money.  I'm buying more even though I have a background in Krav.  SHALACK....CLOSE DA DOOR.....",1427328000,2,403,4.753623188405797

8663843,2,B00L5KOG40,"If you've had no prior knife fighting training, then you will find this dvd to be a great introduction...to those who do have knife training, don't waste your money. I found nothing new or particularly interesting here. And just a pet peeve, the instructor makes a lot of false statements regarding what your opponent can do. Personally I've found that underestimating an opponent, or being sure that no one can get past their moves....that way lies destruction. Anyhow good dvd for  absolute beginners. The moves, drills, etc...are perfectly fine, It's a well made dvd , good quality..Just caught the last three chapters and had to drop it to two stars.",1497916800,2,654,4.945454545454545
