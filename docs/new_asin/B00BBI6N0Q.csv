8565411,5,B00BBI6N0Q,Confidentially Connie was released in 1953. It starred Van Johnson with great support from Janet Leigh. A good film of a young couple having their first child. Fans of Van Johnson and Janet Leigh will like this the most.,1480464000,2,220,4.666666666666667

8565416,5,B00BBI6N0Q,"HOWLINGLY FUNNY because it is so out of date- Van Johnson feels badly because he can't afford to keep his pregnant wife in cigarettes! The lines are hysterical- He describes the ob gyn's office as having so much smoke, it's like a ""forest fire in there"" and  wishes his own wife (Janet Leigh) hadn't made an economic sacrifice to give up smoking! And the entire plot revolves around the power  an appeal of eating red meat. People drool of sizzling huge steaks and a lot of time is spent at a butcher shop!",1412812800,4,506,4.43010752688172

8565418,5,B00BBI6N0Q,This movie was perfect for a doctoral class on moral and ethics.  I can related portions of the movie to theories and practices concerning the moral and ethics of the Texas father/father-in-law to what we describe as facilitation which has consequences -- good and bad -- and how most often this process is never repeated.  Loved the movie and its application to today's life and living.,1394928000,2,387,4.848484848484849
