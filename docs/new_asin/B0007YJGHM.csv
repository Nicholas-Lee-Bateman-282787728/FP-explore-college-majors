8054111,1,B0007YJGHM,I was never able to watch this. It just won't play in any DVD player I've tried it in.,1413763200,,86,3.5789473684210527
8054112,1,B0007YJGHM,"PAL..? I'm sorry man but, I have 2 old systems that play bootleg DVD's and its Nemesis is a PAL format? I don't get it at all. So in essence, I'm dropping $80 after shipping & taxes w/ a new player to watch this recommended video, huh? I should've gone all out and purchased in volumes, lol... Respect to Capoeira and to be continued on this review!",1166400000,,349,4.223880597014926
8054113,5,B0007YJGHM,"This DVD is in a PAL format which is more common is Western Europe and parts of north Africa. The DVDs in the U.S. are NTSC formatted.  What this means is it may not play on your DVD.  Older DVD players may not play PAL format but most new and inexpensive DVD players and computers (Mac or PC) with DVD players can.  So check your DVD players guide before purchasing.  If you have an old DVD player that does not play PAL and would like to enjoy these DVDs do yourself a favor and buy a new and inexpensive DVD player.  I bought a phillip for $30 at Best Buy that plays these DVDs.

In my review I will assume that the person who is interested in what the video is about will already have some capoeira background on the names of some of the movements and other aspects of capoeira.  My intent is not on teaching or explaining capoeira but to cover what is in this video.

`Basic Techniques of Capoeira' is a video that illustrates and explains the various basic movements of capoeira.  However the video goes beyond the basic movements for beginners to more advance movements for intermediate players, that have been playing three or more years.  `Basic Techniques of Capoeira' is part of a series of DVD produced by Independence Production with director Christophe Diez.  He has made 5 films on capoeira as of this writing.  Another video that also illustrates and explains basic movements is `100% Capoeira.'  Both are good videos and both beginners and intermediate (3 years or more) capoeiristas will learn something from this video.  I have been playing capoeira for about 5 years and have gotten a lot from all of Christophe's video.  However, `100% Capoeira' has a wide scope of the capoeira world.  From explaining and showing different techniques, to the different styles of capoeira (Angola and Regional), to clips of rodas, and  information about the rodas.  Basically an all around video on the subject of capoeira which `Basic Techniques' lacks.  This Video `Basic Techniques of Capoeira' does show more advance movement than `100% Capoeira.'  Even though `Basic Techniques' shows more movements, it goes through each movement rather quickly, whereas `100% Capoiera' shows the movement more in depths repeating the movement about 6 or more times from different angles before showing another.  This makes it easy to observe and pick up the movements.  (However, I will not say that one can learn capoeira from watching  this video.  It is helpful if you are taking a class and use it for review).

The video starts with mestre Paulinho and two students to show and explain the movements.  Though mestre Paulinho explains the movements in Portuguese it is translated in two English, as well as French, Spanish, and German in the language selection.  The movements in the video are shown from different angles. The first movement is the ginga, which is shown rather quickly, then goes on to esquiva movements; esquiva atras, de frente, lateral.  The equivas are shown or executed from the ginga position.

Other movements that are illustrated on this DVD - negativa, a, meia lua de frente, quexiada, armada, mei lua compasso, meia lua de cha, beno, martelo, piso, and feintes for basic movements for the beginner.  The video also shows how to use these movements in a combination from ginga to a to negativa to role to ginga again or esquiva atras to role to mei lua de compasso to ginga.  After the combination of basic movements the video shows ataque e defesa (attack and defense) movements and counter attacks.  Giro de quadril (hip turns), moving around your opponent, head butts and tesoura (scissor) movements for more advanced movements that are the next step after the basic movements for intermediate students.

There are some clips of rodas shown in between each chapter and at the end. Mestre Paulinho does give a little back ground information of the roda.  Unfortunately there is little information on the music of capoeira.  This is a good DVD on movements for capoeira and to me would be a good investment for anyone who is a beginner or intermediate taking capoeira class.  This video would be a good review on the basic and intermediate movements one would learn in class to practice at home.  `Basic Techniques' is also sold as part of a box set title `Capoeira 3 DVD Box Set' that includes `100% Regional,' and `Rodas De Capoeira.'  These two videos are also sold separately.",1139356800,13,4406,4.817576564580559
8054114,5,B0007YJGHM,Anyone looking to break into this awesome art should buy theses dvd's. Any newer dvd player will play them and they give awesome instruction to set you up for future techniques. You can actually follow along and understand what they do.,1134259200,2,236,4.780487804878049
8054115,1,B0007YJGHM,"There must be something wrong with me, but any DVD player I try this in it does not work. It says that it cannot read the disc.

But when I put this in my computer and run it through a different formatted DVD player, it works fine.  I don't want to watch this on a small screen....

Be careful..

If I could return it I would, but cannot get anyone to assist.

Thanks",1133481600,3,367,3.9726027397260273
8054116,5,B0007YJGHM,This video provides detailed step-by-step instruction and explanation of basic movements that are used to develop more advanced moves. If you are a beginner looking to build and develop basic skills this is the video for you. All of the other videos out there just show you capoeirstas in the rodas(circles) with know explanations of the movements.,1129420800,5,348,5.12280701754386
