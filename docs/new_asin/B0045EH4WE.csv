8416605,5,B0045EH4WE,"My husband David Veara (Valentino) & a group of his friends put this independent film together & shortly after that, Danny (the director) a close friend of his, passed away unexpectedly.  It was become a sentimental reminder of the fun they had making the film. David says ""Good for Danny! He was able to fulfill a dream before he left us!"" RIP Danny Naten...",1400976000,,359,4.609375
8416606,5,B0045EH4WE,This movie is very good with a great plot and revenge served up very well. I waited for this movie to come to DVD two years and it is well worth the wait!!!,1358640000,,156,3.757575757575758
8416607,5,B0045EH4WE,"I really enjoyed the flick and especially the creativity displayed by a ""rookie"" film Director working on a limited budget.  Additionally, the very strong approval by a veteran industry executive on the Bandana Pictures web site, further reinforces the overall quality of work.  Having a great band and lead singer Stephen Perkins of Jane's Addiction doing the music, is just icing on the cake!!
Mr. Naten---are you working on another project at this time?? Hope so......",1316908800,,471,5.184210526315789
8416608,5,B0045EH4WE,"I was listening to the Mark Gordon radio show with Stephen Perkins from Jane's Addiction and Danny Naten the Director about the making of the soundtrack for the movie. The process they went through to create the soundtrack fascinated me. So I decided to give this little independent film a shot.  Needless to say, I love the soundtrack and had a lot of fun watching it.  It's nice to see a film that doesn't take itself seriously and kinda lets it fly.  Besides, how can you go wrong for 3 bucks.",1308009600,2,496,4.428571428571429
