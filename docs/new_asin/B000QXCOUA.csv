8198137,5,B000QXCOUA,"This is an amazing story of a victim of a sensless violation who was strong enough to survive and composed enough to share her experience and to let it be known that there should be no stigma associated with the wounded.

The introduction to the story by Charlie Gibson says it all, ""And now, we're going to turn to the story of a young woman, who made a big
impression on all of us here at ""Primetime.""  She has an extraordinary
story of survival, and we keep asking how did she do it?  How did she
survive one terrible night at the hands of a crazed attacker.  And what
happened inside of her?  How did she end up concluding that what happened
wasn't something to be ashamed of?  And how did she decide that women
deserve a voice?  And how did she find her voice?""

A SURVIVOR'S STORY is a must see for any human being with a heart.",1202774400,3,834,4.20125786163522
