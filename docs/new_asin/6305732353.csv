1060623,5,6305732353,"B. Monkey - the story of a bad girl turned good after she meets the love of her life: a quiet unasssuming school teacher played by Jared Harris. B., who turns into Beatrice (played by Asia Argento) captures the essence of  the bad, leather clad, cigarette smoking, hip outlaw, but does it with  incredible class. But what else could you expect from Asia Argento? She  presents a character you almost hate to love, but hey, you do it anyway.  Also watch for convincing performances by Jared Harris and Rupert  Everett. EVERYONE MUST WATCH THIS!",962928000,2,543,4.73404255319149
1060624,4,6305732353,"Watching Rupert Everett in this film was riveting; as was watching Asia  Argentino and Johnathan Rhys Meyers. Their performances made the film. The  premise; an unlikely romance between opposites tested by the girl's shady  past, is overcome by a good script and incredibly good characterization by  the cast. Beatrice exists as a talented thief living an unorthodox but  happy life with Bruno(The fabulous Johnathan Rhys Meyers) and Paul(Rupert  Everett) until she decides to live the straight-edge life.
Her departure  begins the principal action. Bruno and Paul can't live together without her  so they break up. Jobs she could have handled get muddled. She falls in  love with a wholesome primary teacher. This relationship's problems begin  with her past's constant resurfacing and their related internal stuggles.  Tensions mount as both Paul and Bruno need her terribly and her lover's  demands forbid her aid. Beatrices choices and actions are human, and  believable, hence the draw of the film. After all, choosing which bridges  to cross and which to burn is difficult for all of us. This is an excellent  film despite Bruno's status as a secondary character.",961027200,3,1169,5.243243243243243
1060751,3,6305732353,"An offbeat drama that blends romance and crime, B Monkey (1998) is set in England, and stars Asia Argento and Jarred Harris as unlikely lovers who are swept into danger by some unusual circumstances.  The film has an erotic vibe, as Ms. Argento is quite comfortable with being nude, and she also brings an edgy street tough attitude to her character.

Known in certain circles as B. Monkey, for her ability to break, enter, and steal, Beatrice (Argento) is a woman who is trying to put her criminal ways behind her.  She is working a regular office job, although her criminal associate Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), is trying to get her return to crime.  Bea is staying in the apartment of another former associate in crime, Paul Neville (Rupert Everett), who besides being into drugs, is deep in debt to a criminal boss named Frank Rice (Tim Woodward).

Alan Furnace (Harris) is a school teacher, who has a second job as a radio DJ playing jazz.  A chance meeting with Beatrice starts a romance, that results in an unlikely relationship, as they are from completely different worlds.  It's not just about sex, but when that aspect catches fire, things head to a whole new level, as Bea moves into Alan's place.  Things are going fairly well, until a crisis at Alan's school, threatens his career.  Beatrice turns to Bruno for help, and in return she participates in one last robbery.  Things get more complicated, and Paul and Beatrice relocate to the country to try and escape their troubles, but there are debts that still need to be paid.

B Monkey is an interesting tale, but one that at its core doesn't seem to be very connected to reality.  While people can change, Paul and Beatrice seem mismatched, and neither character's lifestyle seems to fit with the other.  At one point Bruno asks Beatrice what is she even doing with Paul, and she in turn tells Paul that he hasn't a clue about what life is really about.  Beatrice is still playing by her set of rules, when lying naked with Paul in his bed, she calmly shoots one of Rice's collection agents.  An odd mix of suspense, sex, and violence, B Monkey ends more with a whimper than a bang.

The acting by Jared Harris and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is very solid, and Rupert Everett is convincing as a slimy clinging loser, sinking into decay.  Asia Argento (Land Of The Dead, XXX, Mother of Tears) makes this a compelling watch, as her sexually liberated character is the unpredictable glue between the three men.  Beatrice decisively chooses the direction her life with take.  Although Alan talks a good game, he like the film, comes off as a bit empty and unconvincing.",1315094400,,2628,4.673913043478261
1060752,5,6305732353,This is a great movie on love over lust and the development of commitment between two very unalike people.

1060755,4,6305732353,"Still an interesting and entertaining bit of filmmaking. B. Monkey (played with a ferocious sensitivity by Asia Argento) is trying to leave the game and live the life of a solid, respectable citizen. 2 large problems stand in her way: Paul and Bruno (Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers), her old standbys and partners from her life as a smash and grab thief.

There's such an involved dynamic between B./Paul/and Bruno. Paul and Bruno are lovers, but they both seem to have this insatiable appetite for all things B. (not sexual, but emotional/psychological). B. unfortunately leaves the gang behind for boring, safe, and totally-in-love-with-her, Alan. They are the essence of yin and yang; he's the water, she's the fire.

The soundtrack is rocking with old Reinhardt jazz tracks, a little Peggy Lee, and some Barry White to boot. Asia Argento is completely believable as a willful, vulnerable and self-confident thief turned right, while Jared Harris is great as her calming boyfriend. I really think Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers almost steal the show with their antics (especially Rupert). These were early films for the both of their careers, and it showcases their talent for camp, high drama and theater all at the same time.

The performances and the soundtrack are top-notch and though the pacing of the film is a bit slow in spots, it's not too much of a detriment to the film and even serves the tension between the leads. the film is, at heart, a romance after all and it'd be a shame if they had rushed things.

1060759,5,6305732353,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is certainly a love story, but for me this is only important in that love is one of the things most of us look for in life.  The deeper search, and this is where Asia'a character starts out, is for a life that is not ""frayed at the edges,"" perhaps another way of saying ""whole.""  What plays out is two people, driven in part, for certain, by their passion for each other, but even more for their passion for authenticity, who deepen themselve, each other and an amazing relationship through that search.  It is the insistence of each of these people to fully honor themselves, individually, that causes them to succeed both in their personal quest and in love.  It is they way they ultimately honor each other.  This is a deep life lesson that is not learned by many, which, perhaps, is why so many reviewers miss it.

What they learn is that when they find themselves, ""They Can't take that away from me,"" as the music that accompanies the credits at the end says.

1060760,4,6305732353,"The right person can help you overcome your self-destructiveness. That's pretty much the moral of this oddly endearing love story/crime story.

The principal character--very strongly and naturally played by a not-at-all-inhibited Asia Argento (ie, lots of nudity). I was very impressed by the other main character, Jared Harris, an actor I had only seen previously as Andy Warhol (I Shot Andy Warhol). He's terrific. His voice is fabulous (something in common with dad, the late great Richard H.) He's a good guy, the clean-cut teacher who cares about his students, law-abiding, gentle, jazz-loving. She's the thief with a soft heart, looking for a reason to leave that life, looking for ""family"" (her childhood was not chipper). She's got an ersatz family (a dysfunctional one) with Rupert Everett (as a charming, drug-addled thief) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (as a pretty-boy, screwed up emotionally thief). They care about each other, but are also violent and volatile with each other.

The teacher gets pizzazz in his life from Beatrice (B Monkey); B. gets stability from him. But the dark elements of her character and her dangerous associates intrude into their lovey-dovey life, and they have to make tough decisions about how to continue together. It's very moving when Harris' character asks Beatrice, ""If if was just you and me, and nothing else, would that be enough?"" Ultimately, isn't that what true love may come down to? Is being with that person, like Adam and Eve, just the two of you, enough? Can you give up the thrills of a dangerous life and settle down and be happy?

The ending, violent and an ultimate test of loyalty and love, is explosive and appropriate given what came before. It's a satisfying, if gruesome conclusion to an askew love story.

I've never seen Miss Argento before, and I agree with the other reviewers that she is genuinely charismatic.",1121904000,15,1878,5.028938906752412

In an effort to change lifestyles and settle down, she can't quite get rid of her past and this puts a strain on her newfound boyfriend and her new existence.

1060813,4,6305732353,"*
My personal technical review:
Picture - 3.5, Sound - 3.0, Sound/Jazz - 4.5
This is quite an ususual little movie with unusual colors, good use of sky (in shots), and I suppose it's a bit of a love story.
The overall picture is dark but clear.  It is not true 16x9 but is a nice widescreen presentation.  You will probably have to watch this movie at night or in a very dark room.  With that, the weird blues will jump out at you.
This film will *make* fans for Asia Argento.  For those of us who have enjoyed watching her since ""The Church"", she has matured and looks great.  No doubt as you collect DVD's of her father Dario Argento, you will also buy everything Asia Argento appears in.  Both of them are quite addicting.
A male lead has a part-time or volunteer job as a DJ and plays jazz LP's.  Sometimes in the soundtrack you will hear clicks and pops -- as vinyl records must have been used.  It was an interesting effect.  Other than that, the jazz background music is excellent and never lasts long enough.  Enjoy the Peggy Lee song at the end!  Actually, the movie is fairly entertaining, but Ms. Lee's song for the closing credits is the best part of film, since that song is used as a theme throughout.
The case includes a Chapter List and duplication of the cover on one sheet.

1060814,5,6305732353,"Better move on over Angelina Jolie, Asia Argento is here!! This woman is not only sexy, beautiful, vulnerable and innocent all at the same time, but oh so talented. She seems to just pour herself right into the part. I have seen some of her other performances and this is definitely not a one movie or one character wonder. If she can get a commercially viable project then Oscar's got a new leading lady. Aside from Asia, B. Monkey is a superb movie with a splendidly developed love story. It was bloody wonderful to watch the characters change, become exposed and draw close to one another. Passion, sensitivity, discovery, growth, intensity, tragedy, and love, what more can one want? Oh yea, did I mention Asia?",1018828800,6,715,4.728
1060815,5,6305732353,"This is the story of young and diappointed teacher/DJ Alan  (Jared Harris) who falls for younger and also fed up criminal B. Monkey (Asia Argento). Surprisingly B. starts to like him too and since she already wanted to leave her criminal past behind and live a ""normal"" life everything could be great.
But, of course, it's not that easy, as there are several kinds of problems: the main problem is that Beatrice does have some difficulties with saying goodbye to crime and her criminal friends.  That's why there's trouble to come, but as the tagline says: ""trouble never looked so good"".
""B. Monkey"" is an extremely entertaining romantic-thriller. The great cast is led by sexy Italian Asia Argento (who obviously doesn't have any problems with performing nude), her shy lover Alan is portrayed by Jared Harris who delivers a very sympathetic performance while Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is absolutely brilliant as Bruno, one of B. Monkeys criminal friends. Nevertheless the movie is dominated by Rupert Everett who plays the (gay and drug-addicted) mastermind of Beatrice and Bruno. As always Everett staels every scene he's in. He and Argento are also the ones to supply ""B. Monkey"" with some black humour.
If you liked ""Something Wild"" (starring Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels) you definitely will love ""B. Monkey""!",997833600,6,1316,5.116279069767442
1060816,4,6305732353,"b. Monkey (Michael Radford, 1998)

Michael Radford is one of those directors whose work gets a lot of press, but no one ever thiks to ask who the guy behind the camera was. From the 1984 version (starring John Hurt) of _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ to the Oscar-winning Il Postino, Radford has quietly built an impressive body of work.

Radford's follow-up to Il Postino is B. Monkey, a crime-drama-...-romance based on Andrew Davies' amusing novel about a young criminal lass (played here
by the delectable Asia Argento) who tries to break free of her small-time criminal pals (rising stars Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Rupert Everett) after meeting, and being wooed by, a primary school teacher (the ubiquitous Jared Harris) who is the very essence of stolid middle-class morality.

Don't get me wrong-- the main reason to watch this movie is Asia Argento, who (as I've said before) has since turning eighteen adopted the ""early Helen Mirren"" style of acting-- wear nothing but a come-hither glower and look really good. But if you can get your tongue off the floor, both Everett and Rhys-Meyers give us performances that show exactly why they're becoming two of the hottest properties on the British film scene. Everett is charming and urbane, even while being tracked down by a psychotic crime boss; Rhys-Meyers throw temper tantrums with the best of them, but slides into a cool professionalism when it's time to pull off a heist.

A gorgeous (if somewhat slow halfway through-- it does pick up, honest) way to kill an hour and a half. *** 1/2",989971200,14,1537,4.922779922779923
1060817,4,6305732353,"B. Monkey is a movie that has its flaws, but it's entertaining nonetheless. The director was replaced halfway through filming, and although Michael Radford (the credited replacement) does well, the movie does have the certain vague feel of, well, a film whose director was replaced halfway through filming. There are also a few scenes that go on too long, one or two shots that are inconsistent (for example, the title character walking somewhere in a red dress, only to be at work in a black dress in the next shot), and some dialogue that sounds distinctly written, rather than natural. However, I still really enjoyed this movie. The performances (not to mention the great cinematography) are what really sell it. Asia Argento as B. (Beatrice) is beautiful, charismatic, and a strong screen presence. I expect she will only get better as her career progresses. Jared Harris does a fine job, although (and this is not his fault, just an annoyance of mine) I found his character rather unfeeling in how quickly and completely he expects B. to drop her old life and friends. Those friends/partners-in-crime are played by Rupert Everett, sleazy and clearly having a high time of it as Paul, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, very effective as temperamental, nearly desperate Bruno. The one thing this movie really left me wishing for was a more in-depth look at the relationship between these two and Beatrice. It's an unusual dynamic--Paul and Bruno are lovers, but Bruno is clearly also in love (or at least obsessed) with B., who is the only person to ever truly care about him. Overall, yes, it does have shortcomings and it's not the greatest thing I've seen, but B. Monkey is still a fine movie, plenty of fun, and worth checking out.",986342400,,1731,4.851351351351352
1060818,4,6305732353,"This film, directed by Michael (""Il Postino"") Radford, goes to show that you can't always pick those you love.

If you can swallow the premise, this one sits pretty sweetly on the  pallet of a Eurofilm junkie.  While neither as stylish as ""Diva""  nor as violent as ""La Femme Nikita,"" it owes something to both,  being most at home in scenes that feature its supporting cast of unsavory  characters, which includes Rupert Everett, as a Fagin-esque thief with a  drug habit that gets him into trouble with his suppliers; John Rhys Meyers,  as his punk lover, who proves once again that love is a hurtin' thing; and  Julie T. Wallace, as an abusive mom, who gets a visit from Argento and  Meyers that sets her on the path to righteousness.

As the romantic movie drags on, I keep waiting for the real plot to begin. Rupert Everett is her partner in crime, a somewhat wealthy man who is bi and caters to celebrities. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays his brutish on-again off-again lover, also part of the crime trio.

Argento is overly passionate and provides Jared the excitement his proper boring life does not crave. It is slower developing than say ""Into the Night"" or ""Something Wild"" and is not nearly as good as either film. When you think the film is going to pick up and go someplace, it spins its wheels and somehow turns itself into some kind of chick flick Cinderella story.
