5166171,5,B008I34ZI4,Good product. Had never seen season 2 on tv( wondered if it even existed )so happy to have found it. Completely satisfied.,1347667200,,122,4.590909090909091
5166172,4,B008I34ZI4,"I absolutely love this show, so I'm happy I can add it to my collection finally.

Just take note that it may not play in your PC. Mine worked, but I've heard from others that it only played in their DVD players. There is a warning on this product, so it's not deceitful. It just might be easy to miss if you don't read the Editorial Review section.

I gave it 4 stars because there are no special features what so ever. I really just bought it to add to my Paget collection. The episodes were all available on youtube...",1345852800,15,520,4.19
8528369,4,B008I34ZI4,"I waited for YEARS after watching Season 1 of Huff for Season 2 to become available online somewhere. It never happened, so I finally broke down and bought the disks. It was not as good as the first season, but it was worth it to close the loop on these very interesting and compelling characters and story. Season 1 ended on a major comic/tragic cliff hanger. Glad I still have a rarely used DVD player",1500595200,,403,4.386666666666667
8528370,5,B008I34ZI4,"Best show, yes pretty dark because it's so 'real' but great writing, great acting and just a great show. Shame it ended at season 2 :( I think some people complained about the quality of these dvd's but I did have any problems at all, I used only in my computer though.",1476835200,,269,4.1923076923076925

8528373,5,B008I34ZI4,I have no idea why Showtime canceled this marvelous show! It's a drama unlike anything that's ever been on television. The casting is perfect. Hank Azaria and Paget Brewster are magnificent. I love love love this show.,1447027200,6,218,4.918918918918919
8528374,5,B008I34ZI4,"Thank heaven above for whoever released the second season of Huff on DVD--the first season ends with an intolerable cliffhanger. And then Showtime never released the second season on DVD. What happened that Showtime not only cancelled this show prematurely and abruptly but also seems to have disavowed ever making it?!? You'll notice that the showtime on demand service seems to have all of its original programming past and present, but Huff is conspicuously absent. Literally one of the best shows of all time.",1445990400,3,513,5.119047619047619
