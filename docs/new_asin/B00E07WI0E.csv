Some of them aren't even stories at all, sort of like experimental skits. My favorites were '2 Girls, 1 Camera', 'Il Imaggio', and 'The Courtship'. Lots of other good ones though. The runtime says 141 minutes (which is 2 hours and 21 minutes for the math challenged) but in actuality it's 1hour 41minutes. Still a lot of shorts and a lot of entertainment packed into one DVD.  Great purchase!",1396137600,,545,4.677083333333333

Some are funny, some are explicit, but all are in the spirit of the film... which I'm guessing is advant garde erotica. Since it's unrated, pretty much anything goes. Some of the subject matter is controversial (e.g. the short ""Forbidden"" depicts a photographer taking pics of a dead woman via POV) and a lot of the images are brash... but I think this is what the film is going for and it's done well. Some of the music for some of the shorts isn't so great, and some shorts are better than others, but it's well worth the buy. It's 20 completely different shorts all in around 1hr 40min, which I think is a lot of content for a single compilation. Also, none of them have any dialogue except for one that has a voiceover (""Femme 101""... and it's hilarious). Highly recommended if you're a fan of outside-the-box filmmaking and erotic cinema. Can't wait to see wait these guys do next.",1390780800,,1029,4.4787234042553195
8599696,4,B00E07WI0E,"As the ad states "" this is a collection of 20 different short films""
  I purchased this because as a photographer,I have worked with three of the young ladies in the film.
  I found some of the films exceptionally beautiful,some I found to be disturbing,some funny and lighthearted.
  I enjoyed this video.",1377302400,,306,4.788461538461538
