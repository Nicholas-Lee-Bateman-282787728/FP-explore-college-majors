8286700,5,B001CCNA70,"Woody Guthrie sings the opening strains of A.P. Carter's ""Worried Man Blues"" at the beginning of Johnny Berlin Part 2, and Johnny proves himself to be the definitive Worried Man. Unable to pay his bills or find a job because of his stubborn need to prove himself as an artist, Johnny uses humor to move above and beyond his physical worries, literally to the point of absurdity. He's his own armchair (or, in this case, bean bag chair) philosopher. Climbing into a dumpster full of used books, he declares, ""This is Christmas!"" If only we could all be so lucky.

This is the second in a series that began with Johnny Berlin ...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Berlin/dp/B000O76WV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Berlin</a>",1255305600,2,775,5.6239316239316235
8286701,5,B001CCNA70,"I really loved ""Johnny Berlin"" (Part 1), but the sequel (""Johnny Berlin Part 2: Notes from the Dumpster"") somehow has incredibly surpassed the original.  The eye just can't stop watching with amazement the mesmerizing face of Berlin, just as the ear won't dare turn away from the haunting extemporaneous poetry and hypnotic cadence of this Everyman named Johnny.  Director Dominic DeJoseph has filmed a brilliant masterpiece that epitomizes and encapsulates the human condition in the 21st century by aiming the uncompromising eye of his camera towards the life of a man who lives only by his wits, his words, and his dreams.  First enjoy watching ""Johnny Berlin.""  Then, when the end credits roll and you're asking yourself ""How could it possibly get any better than this?"" move on to Part 2, strap yourself in, and be prepared to be blown away.",1240531200,4,846,4.9787234042553195
8286702,4,B001CCNA70,"This starts out rather slow. Even slow for Johnny B. Once he gets off the bed it picks up. His discription of ""dysfunctional family"" is worth it. Dad's denial and brother's equally crazy lifestyle, gives John some rivaling material to work with, and yes he seems a little more normal than they are. The squirt gun caught me off guard, but the way he explains it - well I'm not sure he really explains it at all. It's fun either way. The dumpster is great in that I'm glad to know there is only 1459 books of a particular title left int he world today. Thanks to Johnny.",1232841600,,569,4.277777777777778
8286703,5,B001CCNA70,"It's not often that an independent documentary will inspire a sequel, but that's just what happened to Dominic DeJoseph's film JOHNNY BERLIN (which played SFF8 in 2006). When we last left Johnny, a train porter with dreams of writing the great American novel, he was headed to Southeast Asia in search of deeper truths. What did Johnny find? A brilliantly funny and wise monologue-as-portrait of a unique American thinker, JOHNNY BERLIN 2: NOTES FROM THE DUMPSTER brings the thoughts and obsessions of writer Jon Hyrns back to Sarasota.",1217289600,2,536,5.1022727272727275
