8026357,5,B0002CZJP2,"I bought this mainly for that opening song: ""Today is Tuesday, you know what that means...""
This volume, as with the other volumes of this set, is mostly superb. Great quality, fun cartoons. Odd, but in some scenes, you see newer Mouseketeers and the host, ""Bob"". Still, I didn't want this tape to end.
Aside for the Mouseketeer singing and dancing, the best part was the old cartoon, ""The Clock Store.""
No doubt about it: This was the best children's show of the '50s.",1088726400,3,469,4.595238095238095
