5708974,3,B00CA5MAOM,"The Dachshund is SO CUTE.. Plot, not so much... Predictable, but about what I expected.  Perfect for wiener lovers out there.",1372723200,16,125,4.9523809523809526
5708981,5,B00CA5MAOM,"This is the story of a family in pain who adopt a little wiener dog they name Shelly.  By focusing on Shelly,  the family dynamic starts to improve. The movie got off to a rocky start.  It was clear that this was a low budget effort but, if you can get past a few hiccups then you might just discover that it's actually a very enjoyable little gem.

This movie had a kickstarter campaign for 10K and backing from a west coast franchise called Wienerschnitzel.  Some reviewers took exception to this but it doesn't detract from the story in the least.  In fact, I thought it made perfect sense since Wienerschnitzel really does sponsor the event that the movie depicts.  This is a cute, enjoyable, genuine G-rated movie that the family will enjoy.",1491350400,4,746,4.56390977443609

These things were awful: Acting, child acting, set design, plot, action shots, and concept.  Between strings of Dachshund hotdog jokes and basic race concepts, this movie never got off the ground.

5709175,1,B00CA5MAOM,"Weak plot, weak script, weak acting and surprisingly not that many wiener dogs!
I mentioned to my wife that it seemed like a crowdfunded movie and sure enough at the end it stated that it was originally started from a kickstarter campaign.
The oldest son scowled and 'played' the guitar, the younger son seemed to be all hair, and the young daughter's screaming became almost unbearable as the movie wore on.
The most disappointing part was the scarcity of actual wiener dogs and wiener dog racing during the movie.
Then of course there was the fact that it showed the star wiener dog injured holding up a front paw only to later have them bandage a rear paw.
Someone obviously told Morgan Fairchild to play it as Cruela De Vil but even that was not fleshed out properly... and even the way she cheated was so unbelievable that it defies explanation.
The worst indignity was that they used 'stand-in' wiener dogs that did not even look close to the ones they were standing in for.
Came in expecting very little... and still left disappointed. My wife took away my movie choosing privileges for a week after this movie :-)

So my famille sat down for a movie night and stared watching. We could not get half way through. It was so poorly written, and the acting was well terrible. The plot of the story is the mother has died recently and one of the kids finds a picture of his mother when she was a child with a Doxie that had won a race. The child has a birthday and he won't a dog like his mother had. So they rescue him one and a rich woman immediately wont's to buy the dog. The movie must have been finance by a fast food chain Wienershnitzel because they are constantly in the restaurant. The father also gets fired from his job working in a gym and replaced by a guy who has a spray that makes you grow muscles without working out. Right? The dog also gets hurt and is holding up her front right leg but they take her to the girls house that signed them up for the race and she raps the back leg.

5709240,4,B00CA5MAOM,"I'm a dog lover (mom to 3 dogs) and pet blogger.  I'm all dog, all the time, but the one thing I cannot stand (besides images of abused animals) are movies with dogs.  At some point a dog is abused or dies and although I know it's all fake, it sticks with me.  I sat down to Watch Wiener Dog Nationals one afternoon when I had nothing else to do and needed to relax and get my head out of my computer (so I watched TV instead).

Wiener Dog Nationals was a total surprise to me.  As I was watching it, I grabbed my phone to post that I was watching a terrible movie - the acting, the predictable plot - but I kept watching.  Before I knew it, I realized that I was hooked.  I passed on lunch when my boyfriend ask, I wanted to see how this movie played out.  All of a sudden, the over acting (not every actor) was fun, the plot was enjoyable, and I wanted to see how it was going to wrap up.

Yeah, the ending was kind of predictable, but I still loved it.  For once, a movie with dogs with no abuse, no dying, and although the story was corny, I loved it and I thought it was fun.  I doubt that I'm the target demographic (kids), but I think dog lovers would get a kick out of it.

It doesn't get 5 stars, but I think it deserves 4 stars from me, because this movie did what I needed; it provided a fun distraction and allowed me a break from my business (much needed).

5709262,5,B00CA5MAOM,"If you love dogs like me, then you'll love ""Wiener Dog Nationals"". This movie is about a little boy named Danny, that dreams of being like his mom, a champion of the Wiener Dog Nationals. He ends up fulfilling that dream finding out that he can do what he wants do if he sets his mind to it.

In this movie, it's Danny's birthday and the one thing he wants for his birthday is a Wiener dog (dachshund). At first, his dad is not too happy about the idea because he knows that taking care of a dog is a lot of responsibility. The dad ends up saying that it's ok to get a dog and they do get a dog. They name her Shelly and she has a very special marking on her hind leg. It's a lightning bolt. Noone really knows what it stands for, but they think that it's cool. Danny enters her into the competition without their dad knowing. They go to the first race and Shelly makes it into the regionals. The problem is that they have to go to Indiana. They tell their dad and he says that they have to take her out of the competition. Then, he realizes that he was wrong and asks to get back into it. There are some problems at first but then she gets back into the Regionals, gets third place and they realize that the owner of the winning dog cheated so she was still in second place. Then the other dog, Handshake, passes the limit of the race. Therefore, Shelly wins the race. The main characters in this movie are Melanie (Alicia Witt), Judge Brown (Bryan Batt), Danny Jack (Julian Feder), Skip Jack (Austin Anderson), Phil Jack (Jason London), and Bridget (Caitlin Carmicheal).

What I like about this movie is that Danny loves his dog so much and that he has people there to support him. My favorite part is when Mrs. Merrywhether gets disqualified because she was playing an unfair game and then Shelly wins the race. There are no parts that I dislike because this movie was great and I really loved everything about it. I recommend this movie to ages 5 to 18, to people that love dogs and to people that help each other. Even though you are competing against some one, it doesn't mean that you have to be rude to each other. Reviewed by Valdi B KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

5709265,4,B00CA5MAOM,"hey listen New york.. anything did something a bit strange but compared to what? Do you konw what Christy quinn does every night.. would make most women loose their starbucks breakfast in a second..

and what about Men marrying men? sending a few pictures is like a child compared to 2 men getting married?? I mean do you know how totally bizzare that is? what they do together , would give most men a nervous breakdown just thinking of it;.;.I mean most men would rather swallow 20 reds and half a bottle of gin rather than swallow what dan savage swallows every night.. or barny frank

Any way kids aren't your parents a bunch of poo poo heads ? sorry you had to see this.. but remmeber how you know someone is a good person?

when I was naked you clothed me

when I was in prision you brought me comfort?  ( anyone try that)

when i was sick you comforted me

when I was alone you brought me frendship

SO you see kids You are all Bad People,,,, your parents are all Bad people, your grandparents maybe they were ok probably bad also...  all you feminst running NY are Bad Bad people..

actaully.. alot of you did the oposite of what this teaching is

so when I was hungry you lauged

when I was unemployed you walked by and said Good God bless this country an unemployed man

when I was lonely and scared you laughed and preteneded to want to be my friend then trashed talked me behind my back then got on TV and said Gossip is healthy and normal..

All NYs are Bad All NYPD FDNY EMT are all very very bad
all preppies are horrrible bad

all europeans are garbage

all mexicans, indians jamaicans chinese bad

all City Council and state senate and Mayors office are all bad

oh and the hungry and naked doesnt apply to much to UWS .. the government has tackled that problem 100 years ago..

Keep it up NY you are the worse and your kids too..

PS Anthony you were going to save the day don't you have like a deputy mayor you can put in your spot, some socialist green party maybe hawie hawkins or jimmy mcmillian or david patrerson? or Bill Maher or alec baldwin or Howawd Dean or Chelsea Clinton or BIll Moyers or Jimmy carter or Cy Vance or Bono or Michael moore or roger moore or mickey mouse just someone who is not a possion of the corporate ABNY CLASS.. RICHARD WOLF or RIchard Brodsky from westchester or Mark Greene or Daniel ELsberg or .....

PPPS what I mean Kids is this is the test of whether your a good person right, this is the only test I know of, you may sit in your chair and say hey Im a good person,.... well if you don't pass this test you really are not.. your mom was lying to you.

5709266,2,B00CA5MAOM,"I was excited about this movie because I love dachshunds.  But the movie was spooty and obviously a low budget film.  For example; Rather than hire extras for the race scenes, they had the actors say ""There are so many people here.""  When there was only about 10 people.  And quite frankly...They just didn't show enough weenees for me.",1374624000,3,336,4.6440677966101696

5709269,2,B00CA5MAOM,"The writing, acting, and editing are pretty bad, even for a totally predictable kid's movie.  Way too much talky drama as a Spielbergian dysfunctional family takes up wiener dog racing while coping with the death of the mother.  Unnecessary side plot involving a scammer hawking a muscle spray.  Morgan Fairchild gives the only half-decent performance among the cast, playing a two-dimensional stereotypical rich bitch dog racer who coddles her showdog and ignores her daughter.  If you're into dachshunds or actual wiener dog races, you'll be disappointed, as the race scenes are very brief and they just cut to the outcome with very few shots of the dogs actually running.  To end on a positive note, at least this movie is rated G and free of the fart jokes, toilet humor, and endless pop culture references that plague most family/kid movies.  There wasn't even a single use of ""wiener"" in an innuendo.",1373587200,2,906,4.966887417218543
