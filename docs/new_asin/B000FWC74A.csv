8127465,5,B000FWC74A,"""Everyone I loved were always just out of reach."" -- Sung-hyun writing to Eun-joo

An achingly beautiful film, its bittersweet tale of love and longing for a happiness perhaps forever out of reach, Il Mare epitomizes why so many are flocking to Korean cinema. Joining films like A Moment to Remember and Ditto of recent times to form a unique genre, filled with a tenderness and beauty heretofore only found in books, Il Mare leaves an impression of images and emotions deeply entwined around our hearts, like flowered vines clinging to a trellis. Once viewed, there is no turning back for the film lover, who will spend much time and energy tracking down the romanticist films of Korea. A lovely and haunting score interspersed with some beautiful jazz selections help create a moving letter of ethereal beauty, as love crosses time only to be kept at arm's length by a gulf too deep to bridge.

Titled in lovely Italian for North American audiences, the original Korean title is based on Chinese characters, meaning time-transcending love. The Sea House and Siworae both hold great meaning for all who have seen this delicately layered love story that squeezes the heart until breath comes grudgingly. Directed with great patience by Lee Hyun-seun and photographed with an eye to elegant simplicity by cinematographer Hong Gyeong-pyo, a quiet and magical mood which never wavers is set for lovely Jun Ji-hyun of My Sassy Girl fame, and Lee Jung-jae. A mailbox outside a lonely house at the end of a pier becomes a portal through which Eun-joo (Jun Ji-hyun) and Sung-hyun (Lee Jung-jae) correspond through time itself. Leaving a Christmas card in her Il Mare mailbox, dated Dec 21, 1999, she requests the next resident forward her mail. That simple act will bring her into contact with a puzzled Sung-hyun, who receives the query, but two years earlier, in December of 1997. What follows is a graceful story of love slowly healing wounds and blooming across the gulf of time.

Eun-joo is very much alone at Christmas and experiencing the pain of love lost when the rift opens and her first letter arrives from Sung-hyun, who thinks a joke is being played. As in Ditto, small things she knows about the past convince both they've actually found some sort of wrinkle in time. There is joy and laughter when they realize it is the mailbox at Il Mare bringing them together. He retrieves a tape player for her, small presents are exchanged, and a date of sorts is arranged, as each does what is suggested by the other, but two years apart. Red gloves she looked at but did not buy, a bottle of wine he leaves her for their date across time, a dog named cola, and a tree he decorated at Il Mare she enjoyed two years into the future offer very special moments for the couple and the viewer. Eun-joo consoles Sung-hyun when his father dies, and sends him a gift to help him heal. Director Lee Hyun-seun makes marvelous use of a bench at a train station where the two often meet, separated by time, and the train which takes her away, to create an atmosphere of longing for what should be but perhaps is not meant to be.

An attempt to actually meet doesn't work, and when she asks Sung-hyun for his help to keep from losing someone, he knows she is the love of his life. A moment of revelation has her racing with desperate urgency to the mailbox to prevent a heartbreaking tragedy. Moving and beautiful, Il Mare will capture your heart and reside there always after seeing it for the first time. Remade in America as The Lake House, the Korean version is a lovely film of poetic beauty. Listings for this film are very murky, so make sure you are getting the original Korean language version, with English subtitles as an option. Those with a romantic heart are urged to see Il Mare, and begin their journey into the world of Korean romanticist cinema.",1282780800,,3848,4.679468242245199
8127466,5,B000FWC74A,"This is a great set. I bought it [...] and was happy when it arrived in the cute picture box. This is in Korean with English subtitles. It comes with a set of postcards with images from the movie and three discs: A movie disc, behind the scenes disc (not subbed) and the soundtrack which is excellent! The music is beautiful and there are sound clips (in Korean) intermingled with the songs in some cases which I have found is typical of alot of Asian drama soundtracks.

If you saw ""The Lakehouse"" and felt curious about this movie, it's well worth it. It's different than the English copy and in some ways a totally different movie. Both movies are very good but I found this one more realistic to the storyline.

The main heroine is a voice actress and she has a less than happy life till she moves into the lake house and makes contact with a stranger through the mailbox. It's a tragic but cute story of love across time. It makes me think of friendships / penpals I've had across the net. They might be in another country but you are still able to form a friendship and learn about them from your home without ever meeting. And in some cases, you do meet. ^_-

Anyhow... besides the fact the guy is absolutely gorgeous (more so than Keanu) and he is a pretty good actor, I highly recommend this for the Asian fans of drama out there.

8127467,5,B000FWC74A,"I first saw ""The Lake House"" and fell in love with the movie.  As I was standing there crying and watching the credits, I saw that the movie was based on ""Il Mare"".

I looked it up and was surprised to find that the movie was not originally an Italian one but a Korean one. I loved ""The Lake House"" so much that I was curious to see the basis for it.

I ordered 2 of the ""Il Mare"" because I wanted one for my sister who is also Korean but doesn't speak the language anymore.  I received the boxset and turned on the English subtitles and was blown away with how incredible this movie is.

While I cried at the end of ""The Lake House"", I cried all the way through ""Il Mare"".  It's deeply emotional and very clever.  The plot is similar to ""The Lake House"" but this one has more nuances.

I highly recommend this to any romantics and foreign film fans out there.

I also plan on buying ""The Lake House"" but love ""Il Mare"" more.",1155859200,18,925,4.094444444444444
8127468,5,B000FWC74A,IN THE BOX IT SAYS REGION 3 BUT IN REALITY IS REGION FREE. I KNOW BECAUSE I CAN CHANGE THE REGION ENCODING IN MY DVD PLAYER AND THE MOVIE PLAY FINE IN ANY REGION #. IL Mare (3 disc Deluxe Edition) DVD boxset.,1151539200,5,208,3.86046511627907
8127469,4,B000FWC74A,"This version is the Korean language version not the Chinese one that I've seen elsewhere on Amazon. Since the actual movie is Korean, then it makes sense that one would want the actual Korean spoken language. Of course, English subtitles are provided. Also, before considering this purchase, you should be aware that this version is Region 3 (Asia).  U.S. DVDs are typically Region 1, so make sure your DVD player can play Region 3 and/or all regions.

This boxset also comes with postcards, a bonus DVD of things like ""Making of"", interviews, promotional interviews, etc., and the movie soundtrack.

Now that the preliminaries are done, as for the movie, I liked it. It's a definite date movie. It's ""You've Got Mail"" meet ""Frequency"" to put it bluntly, but the movie is very subtle with little action. I haven't seen the ""The Lake House"" with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock which is a re-make, so I wonder a bit how the remake will translate. There are certain cultural issues that are hard to carry over, and this movie is no exception. When I watched ""Il Mare"", there were moments that were just ""Korean"", and I knew it. No questions. I just knew. So I wonder how the ""The Lake House"" will handle those moments.

Dialogue is quite sparse throughout the movie, but there was no need for a whole lot more as the facial expression, body movements, and music all helped to convey what was being expressed. And like many Korean romantic movies, there's definitely some cheesiness in the acting - or let's just call it melodramatic. (But hey, you get melodrama in US romances too.) The English translation isn't always correct in having grammatical errors, but they're easy enough to look past as you can still follow the story. The cinematography in ""Il Mare"" is amazing, and probably the best part of the film. It adds a lot. The use of color and the settings where they shot the film are grand. As for the ending of the film, I get the main gist, but I'm still a little confused...perhaps it's because I'm overthinking it.

Overall, I recommend ""Il Mare"" - it's a sweet and subtle film but don't expect a lot of action.  If you buy the movie, spend a little extra and buy this version over the Chinese language version.",1151366400,20,2221,4.653061224489796
