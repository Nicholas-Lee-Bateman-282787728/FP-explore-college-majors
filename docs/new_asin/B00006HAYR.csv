1759653,4,B00006HAYR,"This film portrays an ex-government operative (Westley Snipes) bent on revenge for the killing of his 4-year-old daughter. Versed in the black arts as a trained covert operative, Snipe is a skilled technician as a marksman, as a surveillance specialist, and as a demolition expert. Betrayed by the country he swore to protect, the loss of his precious daughter turns his loyalty to his country around into vengeance against corrupt rulers of the corporate empire. Linda Fiorentino's character (Liberty) is one of the unscrupulous manipulative arms dealers that put the weapon in the hands of the deranged killer. Shielded by the corporate structure, Liberty is immune to the harm caused by her actions for the almighty dollar. Westley Snipes rudely awakens Liberty to the sins of reality. This film is action packed and intense as Westley evokes this terror on the king and queen of the arms empire. He wants the American people to know who is responsible for the moral degradation of society.",1030147200,2,993,5.060975609756097
1759654,4,B00006HAYR,"Okay, so I haven't seen the DVD yet (that would be impossible) but I DID see ""Liberty Stands Still"" just now on Max.  It's propaganda (the father of a victim of the Colombine Massacre turns out to be a CIA sniper/demolitions expert and commits a terrorist act against an arms manufacturer- about as hyperbolic as it gets), but that doesn't detract from it being a fascinating (action)-thriller truly worth Snipes' talent at dark-world-weirdo-with-a-big-shiny-weapon roles.

I'd like to see him in some period films, and the same of Linda Fiorentino. As for Wesley Snipes, I am sure he still needs to pay his IRS bill.
This is a typical rant against the 2nd Amendment and specifically the the ""Right to bear Arms shall not be infringed"". I don't understand why Black people are so against this part of the 2nd Amendment. If it weren't for the 2nd Amendment and the NRA back people would still be stuck in the mid to late 1800's. The NRA was established in part to help Black people how to shoot and to help them acquire firearms. I don't understand why Hollywood is against the 2nd Amendment. It seems like the first thing they want to do after they get famous is go out and buy guns to protect themselves or hire body guards, who carry guns, to protect them!",1451865600,,1079,4.167464114832536

1759762,1,B00006HAYR,"Dreadful thriller about the co-owner of a large gun manufacturing company (Linda Fiorentino playing a character named Liberty Wallace, a touch that writer/director Kari Skogland likely thought was very clever) who ends up chained to a hot dog cart containing a bomb in a public park, watched by a sniper (Wesley Snipes) with a grudge against gun makers since his daughter was killed in a school shooting.  She stays on the phone talking to Snipes and when her phone battery dies the bomb goes boom.

It's clear the film is meant to be anti-gun agitprop but unfortunately the script is way too dumb to score any political points.  It's also complete crap as a thriller--endlessly talky without ever generating even the slightest amount of suspense.  Liberty Stands Still makes the similarly themed but apolitical Phone Booth look like a masterpiece by comparison--the latter movie cleverly looked for ways to generate suspense from the simple set-up while Liberty Stands Still, in contrast, feels like a clumsy high school debate on the second amendment.

Liberty Stands Still squanders a fine cast of Wesley Snipes, Linda Fiorentino and Oliver Platt, but the writing is so terrible that none of the three can do much of anything.  Wesley Snipes still had a viable film career when this was made so it's harder to understand what attracted him to this straight to video dud than his co-stars who were likely just happy to have work.  Oliver Platt continues to be busy as a character actor but Linda Fiorentino only made one movie after Liberty Stands Still and seems to have retired from the business altogether. Meanwhile Kari Skogland wrote and directed two other entirely forgettable films and now makes her living as a surprisingly busy television director.

Given the state our country is in with the inability of politicians to even pass a simple universal background check bill supported by 92% of the American people and an overwhelming majority of gun owners and the fact that the rate of mass shootings in the United States has tripled since 2011 it's safe to say that the United States could use an effective anti-gun film or two but Liberty Stands Still never comes close to working--it's a dull and empty-headed waste that might make you want to shoot your television.",1424390400,,2280,4.934725848563969
1759763,3,B00006HAYR,"While Linda Fiorentino does a wonderful job starring as a hostage chained to a hot dog stand in the park of a crowded city and Wesley Snipes is probably even better as a sniper because he's out for revenge after his daughter was shot and murdered by a gun produced by Linda's husband, this film sure has its share of uninteresting moments.  Instead of being suspenseful or thrilling which is what the film is supposed to be given the description and what it's advertised as, instead Linda and Wesley's characters spend most of their time having in-depth rational and intelligent conversations concerning the second amendment and gun laws which leads to a few unintentionally funny moments.

Oh sure occasionally police officers, news reporters and even a little child demanding a hot dog appear and Linda even whispers ""Bomb"" or spells out the word ""Help"" in a hot dog bun to see if anyone gets the hint that a sniper is pointing a gun at her from the upper floor of a nearby building, but nobody ever understands.  I guess such hints need to be even more blatant if possible!  For whatever reason Wesley's character -despite knowing Linda's trying to reach out for help and even SCREAMS ""There's a bomb!"" for the entire block to hear- he doesn't care enough to retaliate.  I mean that should have been Wesley's cue to shoot her brains out.  Eventually however, the crowd dissolves and the two resume having a conversation about guns some more.  What?  And they spend a LOT of time on the subject too- about 80 minutes worth of time.

There are a few moments that were exciting such as whenever Wesley sniped a few guys in the distance who were aiming at Linda and her hot dog stand.  I had to chuckle a bit when Wesley and Linda were discussing their relatives while others in the distance were shooting at Linda.  Wesley acts like ""Hold on a minute"" *shoots the shooter* ""Okay where were we again?""  lol  Also related to this is whenever Wesley expressed a violent edge and wanted Linda to realize he's a threat, he would shoot right next to her causing several hot dog items on the stand to blow around and yet none of the people walking down the street seemed suspicious that they were getting shot at.  If they were aware items were suddenly blowing around after a bang, it should have occurred to them something was amiss with their surroundings.

Another complaint is that the soundtrack is WAY off.  Techno music more suitable for a popular downtown dance club doesn't get the job done when used in a supposed thriller or suspense involving snipers and hostages.  And this music takes up the entire film.  Also the introduction is really generic and forgettable too.  Linda's talking to her boyfriend who's locked/tied up in a room (a dressing room, heh) with a bomb while Linda talks to him on the phone in the most uninteresting intro ever.  It does nothing to build characters or make them enticing- it takes until Linda's handcuffed to a hot dog stand for her involvement in gun manufacturing and why her character's significant to make viewers interested.

Anyway Linda's husband is probably another notable character since he seems like a rotten typical scumbag unsympathetic or unconcerned for his wife's safety despite knowing she's trapped and needs help in an urgent situation, but then again Linda herself doesn't help matters by hardly showing fear that her life is in danger.  She seems rather calm and disinterested strangely enough despite knowing all it takes is one bullet for her life to be over.  I mean she was almost shot on several occasions but even then she still presented herself like she didn't care.  Even Wesley snipes explaining to Linda about her daughter... we see 2-second glimpses of her daughter but it's not enough for viewers to care that she's dead.

Still Liberty Stands Still is an okay way to pass the time but don't expect to be blown away or even remotely satisfied for that matter.  This movie's average at best and better suited for the politically-minded types interested in gun laws.",1413417600,2,4038,4.749283667621777

1759795,2,B00006HAYR,"Warning***Some spoilers below

This movie has good moments, and creates a surprising amount of intensity for a story that revolves around an individual literally standing still.  However, the political statements related to gun accessibility are way over the top and so heavy handed that they become trite.  After a short while I found myself focusing more on the inaccuracies and inconsistencies of the political arguments instead of the movie itself.

For example, the individual who is upset about the random murder of his daughter by a gunman thinks nothing about killing other people's children. Hmmm... Not a particularly good protagonist.

There is absolutely no counter balance to the story, and the characters become so stereotyped that they lose an real appeal.  This is especially true of Liberty, who lacks any redeming quality.  Further, nearly everyone in the story winds up dead, except for Liberty, who gets to walk off with her boyfriend after leaving her husband, who unnecessarily placed himself in danger to try to save her, dieing on the street. She didn't even give him a backward glance. I have to admit that by the end of the movie, she was the only character I really wanted to see die.  Instead, she is the only one who lives.  Go figure... (I think the director wanted us to think of the husband as the villain and Liberty as the hero, but I can't think of a single appealing characteristic of Liberty whereas the husband demonstrated bravery, motivation, and a willingness to sacrifice for others.)

Over all, the movie isn't worth the ride.  The cinemaphotography is stylish and the concept is neat.  However, the politics are just too dogmatic and poorly argued, and the characters are not compelling.  It could have been a good movie, but it just didn't turn out that way.",1140393600,9,1803,4.930463576158941

His chosen target will be the seductive wife of an important executive. She is not precisely a special angel and devoted couple.

Despite certain inconsistencies in its dramatic profile and two serious defaults of artistic edition the film gets its goal. A good entertaining with some awesome statements in the overlong cell dialogue between the hunter and his frightened victim.

In the other hand the dramatic parallelism with Phone Booth is more than obvious.

Which are the two faults? . Well, the first of them is  Where could Linda Fiorentino get a blanket to cover the corpse of the murdered? Do you really think it was inside the Hot Dogs expenditure?. And the second issue is related to a clever mistake in the make up and stylist hair of Fiorentino . Please watch very carefully in the second third part of the film this detail: if she is enchained to the car after several hours of high emotional tension I guess she must be tired, with a no delineated make up and disordered hair: But not , she looks gorgeous, splendid as if she came from the hairdresser.

Let's not talk about the issues like pro- or anti-gun control for now, because the film (which is directed by the same person who did ""Children of the Corn 666"" -- quite a damning title) has no thrills or suspence.  And at the time of writing this, we have not seen Ms. Fiorentino for two years -- hope it has not killed her career.
The story is marginally interesting; I say marginally, for we later are to see much better ""Phone Booth.""  Like Colin Farrell film, the protagonist Liberty Wallace (Linda Fiorentino) finds herself in a big trouble.  Someone named 'Joe' (Snipes) aims a rifle at her while she is chained to a hotdog stand where an explosive device is set.  And Liverty is a wife of a rich gun manufacturor (Oliver Platt), and Joe claims he lost his daughter because of the gun her company made.
The story, which starts promisingly, suddenly loses steam in the first fifteen minutes.  And then, it's all about the confusing situations and paper-thin characters whom we just don't care.  In terms of thriller, first of all, it is a total failure.  See, if the guy Joe is really a good marksman as the film shows, why does he need a bomb in the first place?  Unaccountably, the film introduces another 'bomb' rigged to the body of a poor fellow (who is supposedly having an affair with Liberty) which only detracts the tension of the main story.
The film rasies interesting questions such as, Is Liberty (or her husband) really responsible for the death of the people killed by guns?  The director clearly leans on the left side, which in itself is no problem.  But as the character of Joe is so superficial and unconvincing that his logics start to look like that of a monster.  He never tells us what happened to the daughter, nor he blames the culprit while he could kill innocent people.  There is little sign of intelligence behind his characterization, which is an insult to the victims or survivors of the real murder cases.
Of course, the film could be an example of escapism, (like ""Phone Booth"" again), but the film suffers at that point from the bad acting and awful dialogues with cluttered pace.  Wooden performance from the two leads are deplorable, and as to Ms. Fiorentino, we sincerely miss her in ""MIB.""
Need a thriller with snipers?  Again I say, see ""Phone Booth"" instead.  And its sniper Kiefer Sutherland is ten times more authentic than Snipes, though -- or perhaps because -- Kiefer scarcely shows his face.",1089676800,9,2586,4.700665188470066
1759799,4,B00006HAYR,"Guns don't kill...people kill.  But, where did the people get their guns?  And why would a young child be allowed to walk into a school and kill someone?  These issues are at the heart of this film, as this is the supposed motivation for Wesley Snipes in this mainly effective drama.  Whether you're a gun control fanatic or one of those good old boys that think having a gun is the next best thing to heaven, this film has its disturbing moments and benefits from a good director and a good cast.  Linda Fiorentino at first bothers me with her lack of emotional impact; but as the film progresses, we see why Fiorentino is underplaying her role so much.  She is an emotionally wounded individual and only by the film's end do we see what she has struggled through.  Snipes is effective but he was almost too restrained to be totally convincing; would have liked to see more of his anger, guilt, and hurt.  Oliver Platt is okay, but his performance isn't given enough chance to grow.  Likewise, Hart Bochner as the chief of police.
The movie is slowly paced and doesn't have quite the emotional impact of PHONE BOOTH which had the marvelous Colin Farrell to propel it.  However, LIBERTY STANDS STILL makes you think, and if that's what the director/write wanted, she succeeded for me.",1083888000,2,1284,4.616740088105727
1759800,5,B00006HAYR,"Im surprised and disappointed with the the bad reviews on this movie. This is why i am compelled to say my word. Overall, this is a nice movie, that succeeds to keep your interest with barely one location in the whole lentgth. It was a very stylish movie and both the directors and actors did a good job. I don't know how to justify this very well but i have seen good movies and bad ones and it is a shame to say such a hard work art piece is bad. The problem about it is that you would normally expect with wesley snipes a movie with plenty of action and movements but this one is different. Just different, but not bad. And in my personal opinion, very good. Not to say that i own the DVD but that i enjoyed the movie. And about the people who say they don't agree with the message of the movie against the right to bear arms, they should know that a movie is just a movie, and primarily entertainment. Judging a movie objectively means doing so without putting first your personal political prejudices.",1072828800,3,1006,4.272251308900524
1759801,1,B00006HAYR,"I'll say it straight out; I'm pro-gun and proud of it. I'm also a lover of nearly any and everything film related, though this movie is just pure garbage.
The whole thing is  poorly shot, acted, and written anti-gun propaganda. In an awful attempt to be ironic, the movie has ex-CIA agent Snipes (who has starred in more than a few movies that glorify guns) holding gun executive Fiorentino hostage with a sniper rifle.
Not only does the movie completely fall flat with it's rapport between the leads (unlike Phone Booth, which has a similar scenerio but is brilliantly executed), but the movie takes the trouble to insist that gun companies are responsible for deliberately giving out arms to gang members. While it's definitely not anywhere near below the anti-gun lobby to lie, the assertion that the gun industry hands out firearms to gangs is so ridiclious that even a detailed look at any anti-gun website won't make the claim. This movie is ridiclious, and instead of trying to make a sensible argument for gun control, it decides to try to manipulate emotion and distort the truth, much like Bowling for Columbine. Unless you're rabidly anti-gun, avoid this at all costs.",1062460800,6,1179,4.865671641791045
1759802,3,B00006HAYR,"Liberty Stands Still (Kari Skogland, 2002)
This movie, whose US run was a stint at the Palm Springs Film Festival, is hard evidence that even if you're on the A-list, they still won't release everything you make. Wesley Snipes heads up this thriller, backed by B-listers Linda Fiorentino and Oliver Platt, and still the biggest market it played was Italy; its Japanese release was also limited.
Snipes stars as Joe, a disenchanted guy with a sniper rifle and a chip on his shoulder. Through a series of not-so-subtle machinations, he traps the heiress to the company that manufactured the rifle (Fiorentino) and has her handcuff herself to a hot dog cart containing a very large bomb in LA. The film's remaining eighty-six minutes (it's ninety-six minutes long, in total) cut between the growing bond between hostage and sniper and the hostage's various attempts to get help.
The above sounds like a setup for a movie that beats one about the head and neck region with a gun control message and has nothing deeper for the average viewer. Such is not the case; Skogland does a decent enough job of keeping the gun-control rhetoric to a minimum and in believable places. The message is still a little overpowering, but not nearly as bad as it could have been. The pace is a bit slow for an action/suspense film, but once you're in the proper position, what is there to do, really, but wait? Perhaps the best way to approach this movie is as a combination of the overly preachy John Q. and the as-yet-unreleased Phone Booth.
Snipes takes the same deadpan approach to this character he did with Monroe Hutchens in Undisputed, and minimalism is not the best way for Snipes to go. His best moments are when he's right on the edge of losing control. They are, unfortunately, too few. Oliver Platt, as Fiorentino's husband, does a better job here. Unfortunately, he gets too little screen time, and his character is too two-dimensional for him to do much with. What little he can do is worthwhile, however. Fiorentino is fine, and as believable as can be given the situation.
All in all, not a bad way to kill ninety minutes. Could have been better, but could have been much, much worse as well. ** 1/2",1040860800,9,2194,4.701298701298701
1759803,5,B00006HAYR,"This a superbly crafted story dripping with suspense and tension. It grabs you by the throat for a ninety minute ride. The direction and acting are superb and this is far and away Wesley Snipes best recent film. It's so good to find a film that contains a real plot and a very plausible story line that doesn't rely on special effects. I enjoy the regular Hollywood films too, but it's nice to find a film that gets the brain going like this one does. It has all the traditional qualities of great story telling.
My wife and I found ourselves on the edge of our seats, at first wondering what Wesley's character is after, and then which way the story will go. It is in my opinion a very original way to tackle a thorny issue. Whilst most people will thoroughly enjoy this DVD it's probably not going to appeal to members of the gun lobby!",1039478400,6,838,4.343949044585988
