5580149,2,B00BCXW0XE,"I've been waiting awhile to complete my collection of Tiny Toon episodes, mostly for the Return of Bat Duck and the Music Day episodes. I'd rate this one higher if they hadn't botched up one of the episodes. The Weekday Afternoon Live episode starts out okay but the 2nd half is from a different episode entirely. How did they make a mistake like this; or is it just a problem with my copy alone? I hope Warner has some kind of plan to rectify this mistake. I haven't noticed problems with the other episodes yet but I still haven't watched them all yet so we'll see. Really though, we go from SNL skits to a music video countdown from a different episode.",1369699200,14,656,4.385245901639344

I like this show and my favorite character in it is Buster Bunny so I don't
mind investing the money to buy and own this series to see it wherever
I choose.
However, the package was in bad condition where a piece snapped off.
The dvd lays loose in the box. Plus, they drew Buster in an awkward
position where the foot is in the opposite position for that golf swing pose.
Plus, his body is all twisted and awkward. I'm sure this is not Amazon's
fault, but the cartoonist or whoever works on dvd box covers, drew this
weird so that it's distracting.",1380672000,,625,4.260504201680672
5580167,3,B00BCXW0XE,My daughter wants this for her collection and I have been waiting to see if they fix the botched episode. Has anyone gotten one recently that was made the right way?

Thanks for any input.,1379980800,,343,4.0588235294117645
5580168,3,B00BCXW0XE,"You see, Tiny Toon Adventures is a great show. One thing about what is bad about buying used items is that some of the boxes I recieved was a bad condition. Overall in the inside it was good because people lie about their condition. I bought an item which was like new and then when it arrived it was good not ""LIKE NEW"" they lie, they sell their used things because it's broken. I recommend you guys to not buy used items and buy new items because some of the items I got were destroyed.",1378339200,,488,4.147368421052631

5580171,4,B00BCXW0XE,"I got Tiny Toon Adventures volumes 3 and 4 as gifts recently.  I really was glad to see these volumes released, and now I own the complete series on DVD.

As for the quality of the release itself, this is a disappointing effort on WB's part.  The cover art is nice, but that's about the only aspect of the presentation worth commending.  The episode select menus are embarrassingly bare-bones and is even below boot-leg quality.  The recent Animaniacs volume 4 DVD release has much more professional looking menus.  The episodes themselves have adequate but inconsistent picture quality transfers (a little blurry on some eps according to my eyes).  No bonus features, but that's probably to be expected given this is clearly a budget title release.

The problem with the ""Weekend Afternoon Live"" episode of Disc 2 is a major embarrassment for this release which might discourage folks from buying until WB can correct the problem for all copies currently in circulation.  Since I own an errant copy, I contacted WB Home Video customer support two weeks ago and received wonderful communication from the staff person.  I received my replacement disc in the mail this week, and the episode is now completely in tact.

Tiny Toon Adventures deserves better respect that what it got for its Volumes 3 & 4 DVD releases, but at least they were released and the price is very affordable for the amount of episodes.  I recommend fans buy them and contact customer service if they got one of the problem discs.",1374624000,3,1501,4.8431372549019605
5580172,4,B00BCXW0XE,"I was glad to finially have every episode on DVD. I was even glad to finially watch my favorite episode, Toon Tv. Unfortenutly, when I ot to Weekday Afternoon Live, it showed only half of that show, then it showed half of the rest of Toon Tv. I know I said that that show was my favorite, but I didn't want it to interupt one of the other episodes. Luckily, they had that episode on youtube.com. I just hope the people who where in charge of the problem are fixing it right now.",1373500800,4,478,4.150537634408602
5580173,1,B00BCXW0XE,"As you can read from the other reviews, the second half of weekday afternoon live has been replaced with Toon TV on disc 2.  This issue has been around since the dvd was released over a month ago.  So far, WB has said very little about this.  I sent them an email and was basically told they were aware of the issue and they would send a replacement disc when they had one.  Well, I got the ""replacement"" disc in the mail today, which was just WB sending me another copy of the original disc 2 with the flawed episode.  Frankly, it was insulting.  I would like to note that this replacement disc and WBs response to all of this is the reason for my low rating (I would give a 0 if I could).  The other episodes on the disc are not in great shape, but they are there and are watchable, which is all I wanted, but half an episode flat out missing is a big deal and cannot and should not be ignored.",1373241600,6,896,4.056818181818182
5580174,4,B00BCXW0XE,If you grew up in the 90s you should remember tiny toons.  this set has one problem. the episode of Weekday afternoon live on the final 10 min is over lapped with the episode Toon tvs last 10 min. so you end up watching it again. so the final 10 minutes of weeday afternoon live are missing. but the rest of the set plays fine. still a great show.,1372464000,,347,4.028985507246377
5580175,5,B00BCXW0XE,"I loved ""Tiny Toons"" in the 90's and I was disappointed when it went off the air.  Several years ago, seasons 1 and 2 were released and I thought they were they complete series until I realized that many of my favorite episodes were not on either season.  The Plucky Duck as a baby episodes ""Water Go Down the Hole"" and ""Ellalator Go Up"" are both on Season 4.",1372204800,8,359,4.188405797101449
5580176,2,B00BCXW0XE,"I have done much research and every site not just amazon is complaining about this DVD set to have a issue with an episode that doesn't play all the way through and then puts you into another episode. I don't feel safe buying this for my friend who loves the series, not until Warner Bros fixes this.
I do not recommend anyone to buy this till the problem is fixed by Warner Bros.",1372118400,3,380,4.219178082191781
5580177,4,B00BCXW0XE,"My copy as well has the botched episode on disc two.  It's the same error that other reviewers have described, ""Weekday Afternoon Live"" has the second half of ""Toon TV"" instead of its own ending.  I contacted Warner Bros. and they sent me a shipping label to send the set back to them.  I have yet to receive the new set with the hopefully fixed disc 2.  I will post more on this review when I receive the replacement.  In my opinion the show was one of the best that I remember when I was a kid.  I was very disappointed with the error on this set and hope Warner will rectify the issue.
UPDATE 7-6-13: I have received the replacement disc along with the complete DVD set I sent to Warner Bros.  The replacement disc had the same error on it, the problem has not been fixed yet.  I am contacting Warner AGAIN to resolve this.  I will update again later.
UPDATE 7-24-13: I have received the RE-replacement disc from Warner Bros.  The ""Weekday Afternoon Live"" episode is finally fixed.  I have watched most of the disc and everything else seems to be fine.  If I find any more errors I will post them but for now all is well.  This was truly a good show, it's too bad this disc problem had to mar the final release of the regular series.  I am hoping the Spring Break special and Night Ghoulery will be released soon, hopefully complete and error free.",1371772800,21,1351,4.309523809523809
5580178,4,B00BCXW0XE,"It's time you got yourselves a nice cheese sandwich, because this is the fourth and final volume of ""Steven Spielberg presents Tiny Toon Adventures"" !  Pint-size versions of your fave Warner Brothers characters are at it once more in sixteen sensationally silly stories such as:

""Flea for Your Life"" - A special episode starring the family of fleas that reside on Furrball's back who are now working for a diabolical tick boss.
""Toons Take Over"" - Buster, Babs, and Plucky attempt to make their own episode of ""Tiny Toons"" filled with action, drama, romance, and no comedy whatsoever.
""Toons from the Crypt"" - Witness a trio of scary (but silly) stories that will send you a chill in your funny bones.
""Two-Tone Town"" - Buster and Babs visit a city of black-and-white cartoon characters who are in need of a big comeback.
""Toon TV"" - Some of your favorite Golden Oldies and more are being sung by your fave toonies in this music video countdown.
""Music Day"" - The three episodes are linked to a musical theme from Buster Bunny matching wits with a sappy singer to Shirley the Loon's ballet audition to Little Sneezer's bad trumpet playing.
""The Horror of Slumber Party Mountain"" - Elmyra tells you a scary story about the gang having a sleepover and playing constant pranks on each other.
""Weekday Afternoon Live"" - Our crazy cast will have you in stitches when they spoof a known sketch-comedy show.
""It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special"" - When Buster Bunny's plans for a big holiday production go horribly wrong, he begins to experience a life without himself.

So that should make your tiny, tooney, and absolutely looney series complete along with the movie ""How I Spent My Vacation"".  But I heard of a pair of special episodes that are yet to be released which are ""Sping Break"" and ""Night Ghoulery"".  Maybe they will be out on DVD eventually.  And maybe the ""Animaniacs"" movie ""Wakko's Wish"" will be, too.  I don't know for sure, but catch Tiny Toons as they are now back on the tube as part of Hub Network's lineup !",1371340800,,2034,4.696629213483146
5580179,4,B00BCXW0XE,"Mostly just a collection of funny cartoons, but there are a few gems among these toons. I especially liked two-tone town (because I'm a big fan of older cartoons and I like cute cartoon foxes), Buster's directorial review (Babs turns into a REAL bunny, and Plucky, Hampton, Shirly, and Elmyra all get hit with anvils while singing anvilholma. Beat THAT!), and episodes like A cat's eye view, and It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special provided the right amount of heart to pull things together.",1371168000,2,501,4.905882352941177
5580180,2,B00BCXW0XE,"Like many others, my copy has the second half of Episode 6 from Disc 2 replaced with second half of Episode 8 of disc 1.

But I have one more issue, DVD 1 just won't play episodes 4,5, or 6 properly on all seven of my DVD-rom and players. Starts skipping badly despite the disc surface looking flawless. Will not play at all on my computer, tried 5 different DVD-roms, disc 2 has no playback issues and only has issues with the episodes mismatch.

Not sure if I want to return this as there is no telling if WB will decide to fix this.
