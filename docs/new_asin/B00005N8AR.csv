1628701,5,B00005N8AR,"I watched this as a young man and was so impressed with the dialogue and most perfect grammer and oration my Jose Ferrer.
If only our young people could speak as well today... what a pity our language has become.
This movie also helps instill manhood in a young man, teaching him how to be a better gentleman and to demonstrate passion through mere words and proper action given to a lady. Evrey video library should have a special display of the finest performances and this movie is in a very special place of it's own. The shipping was faster than expected and came very well packaged. I had no problems at all with playing it on my DVD player or any computer that I travel with.. (downloaded now so my disk stays at home) The sound is crystal clear and the visual is clean with no grey scratchiness that is found in some other classics.  This is a great classic. Heck... I'm gonna go make some popcorn and watch it again right now... Cheers!",1372896000,,945,4.4
1628702,4,B00005N8AR,"Double feature with Jose Ferrer in leading role.  Ferrer is outstanding in both films.  I believe a more refined editing of the films would have increase the excitement level, which would earned a higher rating from me.  These are classic thinking type films.",1364083200,,259,4.976744186046512
1628703,5,B00005N8AR,"Read this in high school and college, saw this movie at the same time, thought I would be a theater major because I enjoyed it so much.  Cyrano's thoughts like lightning bolts.  Ferrer's swordsmanship in the movie was priceless, his athleticism and endurance coupled with composing a ""ballade"" are unequaled in movie history.  He thoroughly deserved the oscar.",1354665600,,360,5.172413793103448
1628704,5,B00005N8AR,"I'm very familiar with this movie, having seen it in England shortly after it was released.  My VHS version, and a couple of DVD (transfers from tape?) from other suppliers didn't even come close to this DVD from Marengo Films.  Hard to believe the original print is more than sixty years old...Marengo Films have done an admirable job!
As for the movie...It may lack the lushness of my Depardieu 'Cyrano', but for 'style' and Jose Ferrer's superb performance...in a word...Excellent!
I'm not familiar with the second movie on the disc; I'll save it for a rainy day!",1352937600,,566,4.824742268041237
1628705,5,B00005N8AR,"There is nothing like the old school. This Play, this man, this story is all the best in entertainment and more.",1252800000,,112,4.380952380952381
1628706,5,B00005N8AR,"My opinion is that Cyrano stands alone. It is one of the best. The other, The Son of Monte Cristo, Not so much...",1204934400,,113,3.9565217391304346
1628707,5,B00005N8AR,"Cyrano de Bergerac was an early film for Jose Ferrer and it was great one.  A swordsman who would compose a poem to his foe and recite it as he fought.  Impossible odds were nothing to him.  This film has always been a favorite of mine ever since I was a kid watching it on a Saturday afternoon.  This copy is a good one.  In fact I am sure it is the best on the market and it came out at a time when I had given up any hope of ever having a good copy.  I have bought this movie 3 times and gave away the first two copies because they were such bad transfers.  But this one is great!  And I don't want to leave out the Son of Monte Cristo.  Louis Hayward gives a great performance but George Sanders steals the movie in one of his great roles as the villan.  Plus, for us baby boomers, Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) plays a good guy without his mask.  It is nice to see that they are saving some of the old classics.  If you are a movie buff and collector, I would highly recommend this copy.",1201132800,,994,3.9396984924623117
1628708,4,B00005N8AR,"This pubic domain double feature was of surprisingly good quality.  No one would mistake the picture quality for a Criterion, but it's far better than most.  Most annoying is the Marengo promo at the beginning which cannot be skipped or even viewed at high speed.  Want Cyrano?  Or The Son of Monte Cristo?  Go for it.",1190073600,,318,4.607142857142857
1628709,5,B00005N8AR,"No, I am not pushing Wrigley's Doublemint Gum. Quite the contrary, there is absolutely nothing ""gumming up the works"" in these two stunning releases from MARENGO FILMS. I went through every release of CYRANO DE BERGERAC on the DVD market before trying the MARENGO version, and I can now say all competitors pale in comparison. Throw away all those other dupey, soft focus copies with hissing sound. MARENGO has made it possible to see CYRANO just as it was on a theater screen in 1950. The picture is razor sharp and the sound is loud and clear from start to finish. What a joy it was to watch such a beautiful transfer of this marvelous film!

And the exact same can be said for SON OF MONTE CRISTO. After going through nearly all of the other horrible transfers of this title, I am delighted to report that MARENGO has hit the nail squarely on the head. The picture and sound are both truly exquisite.

And folks, take a look at the low, low price. You get two fantastic films in fabulous transfers for less than you generally pay for just one DVD title. Three cheers for MARENGO FILMS!!!",1172620800,,1090,4.5
1628710,5,B00005N8AR,"Like the other reviewers here have stated, the transfers are very good.  I read a reviewer at ""DVD Town"" who wrote that this transfer is much better than a previous Marengo release of ""Cyrano.""  Aside from the quality, the stories of both movies are very interesting.  ""Son of..."" is a good movie I had never heard of before.",1101945600,,325,4.568965517241379
1628711,5,B00005N8AR,"First... these two prints are FANTASTIC... the sound is PERFECT.
If you like real heroes you will love Cyrano, if you like love stories you will love Cyrano, if you like swashbucklers you will love Cyrano... Can you tell I LOVE THIS MOVIE... The Son of Monte Cristo was enjoyable too... it's a kick to see Clayton Moore without his mask...! Excellent product from Marengo Films.",1063238400,,378,4.742424242424242
7946362,5,B00005N8AR,"Jose Ferrer is fabulous as Cryano, and it is why all the feedback is superb for this movie. This is the original and it is why people who happen upon it the first time, never forget it and always come back to it fondly.
In reading other feedback of those who complained about the night fighting scene being dark.........well it is DARK and whether it was intentional or not, the viewer is watching a sword fight in the darkness. That does not mean the screen is black, but that there are shadows at times in things are hard to see in a real night time event. It should add drama and anticipation if you are drawn into the fight scene as you are witnessing what Cyrano did.

Mr. Ferrer, in his finest performance, carries this movie and the rest of the cast. He is so perfect in the role and the fact is he is the stellar light moving through the sky and one notices the other actors and actresses as orbs in their passing. This is one of the most well made movies of all cinema history and is a hidden gem.

As for the second movie, I had hoped that Mr. Ferrer was in Son of Monte Cristo, but he is not. So that movie is mediocre in that disappointment. Nothing compares to Cyrano, and I doubt I will ever watch Son of Monte Cristo again as it is nothing outstanding.

This is the Cyrano though that everyone is looking for. It is as good of quality as there is in this version and the price was perfectly affordable when I purchased it.",1515456000,,1437,4.218181818181818
7946363,5,B00005N8AR,"What a tour de force and over the top performance by Jose Ferrer.  ""Son of Monte Cristo"" is a decent swashbuckler, for the price this is a fine deal for two films.",1514073600,,163,4.09375
7946364,5,B00005N8AR,I read the  play. The film is a classic and I enjoyed this production,1506297600,,69,3.9285714285714284
7946365,5,B00005N8AR,"Personally, I love Jose Ferrer's portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac. His facial expressions, mannerisms and rich vibrant voice all contribute to making this performance the award winner that it was. Story wise, it's great for the romantics who don't mind a bittersweet ending that may make one cry. On the other hand, I was NOT pleased with the Marengo Films addition. Others may have a different experience, but with my copy the picture was so dark that you couldn't see the sword fight scene with Cyrano's ""100"" assailants and could not truly appreciate the actors expressions and the little nuances which really contribute to the film. I had read the very positive reviews for the Hal Roach Studios edition and decided to give it a try; it did not disappoint. The picture was bright and the audio was very clear, a little low but that's an easy fix. For those who love old movies, I would recommend Cyrano de Bergerac and I would highly recommend the Hal Roach edition.",1471478400,,969,4.739644970414201
7946366,5,B00005N8AR,"good product, quick delivery",1445299200,,28,6.25
7946367,3,B00005N8AR,"I purchased this solely on the recommendation of other reviewers who asserted that this Marengo Films edition of ""The Son of Monte Cristo"" is the best.  I'm disappointed.  The picture and sound is slightly better than the Alpha Video release, but nothing great.  As for Cyrano, the Olive Films blu-ray is the way to go for picture and sound.

Moreover, Marengo Films has an annoying advertisement at the beginning of the disc that cannot be skipped.  One has to wait through the entire advertisement (fast-forward, skip, and menu buttons don't work) to get to the main menu to select the film one wishes to see.  Very lame!

As for the films themselves, ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" is 5-stars, and ""The Son of Monte Cristo"" is 4 or 4.5.  Both are top-drawer examples of swashbucklers and very entertaining.",1428710400,,799,4.823529411764706
7946368,5,B00005N8AR,"This is the Oscar-winning version and it focuses on the finest moments. The play itself is far more detailed than the movie, but I do love it. My complaint is that I have to go through too many ads to get to the film, every time I try to watch it.",1427932800,,247,3.8627450980392157
7946369,5,B00005N8AR,"Good quality sound and video - not HD, but then I wasn't expecting it to be :)

Wonderful films.  Ferrar's portrayal Cyrano is simply mesmerizing; one of the all-time great performances.",1416873600,,186,4.967741935483871
7946370,5,B00005N8AR,Terrific picture and sound. A great deal.,1413244800,,41,5.0
7946371,5,B00005N8AR,"One of my favorite films of all time. The dialog, acting, and comedy is so brilliant that I strive to be as talented an actor as Jos Ferrer one day.",1404345600,,148,3.966666666666667
