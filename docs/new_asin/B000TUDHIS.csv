8210948,4,B000TUDHIS,"The British Transport films were something one (as casual film history buffs) always heard about but never quite got around to seeing (either owing to difficulty finding them or because watching govt industrial films ""made right"" is not sexy.) This collection is a good cross section of the various offerings disc-ed up by British archives (usually found in VHS or PAL.)  The range here is kinda narrow, avoiding the more dramatic transport stuff or the more rhythmic material also generated in that era. Check out Geoffrey Jones if you can.) But, these are industrial films that transcend the genre simply because they are detailed, professional and curious about the techne of the railroad system in such a way that they illuminate equally the rail road workings as well as the people around the industry.  Captures a tone and age.",1195603200,3,833,4.985611510791367
