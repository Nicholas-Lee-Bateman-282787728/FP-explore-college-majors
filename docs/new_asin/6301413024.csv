334058,4,6301413024,"Betty entered our lives maybe a decade ago, so I got this show to see the drama. Hollywood softened many elements of how this amazing feat getting roughly 200 orphaned infants out of Saigon happened, but it is a great story. Betty in the recent decade developed a 501 3c ""H.A.L.O."" Helping and Loving Orphans at [...] - her work is impeccable, she is an amazing gift and inspiration. This movie does her actions in 1975 justice -",1185408000,3,429,4.512820512820513

334113,5,6301413024,"Interesting true- story time piece with several people actually appearing as themselves including Ina Balin, of course.  Story of how Vietnamese orphans were rescued from Saigon during the war.  Presented as more of a dramatized documentary.

334144,4,6301413024,"Wonderful film about saving children.  One thing the film makers could have done was less time wasted on close-up facial expressions and more dialogue and a little more attention to detail and the true horrors of homelessness suffered by the orphans of war. This could have been a 6-star plus production if more time and effort had been put into the making of this film.  In any event, get the tissue box ready.",1452556800,,411,4.616438356164384
