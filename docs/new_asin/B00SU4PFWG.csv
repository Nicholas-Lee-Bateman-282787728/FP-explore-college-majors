6992825,4,B00SU4PFWG,"I wanted to give Aftermath (2013) a flying 5 stars...but the last 15 minutes of the film are really disappointing.  The film starts off really strong.  It is one of those independent thrillers with an interesting and very realistic movie plot.  The film also incorporates Sin City-type of comic book effects, and is composed like a short book; 4-chapters all together.

Short synopsis: (The setting--- Upstate New York)

Tom Fiorni is leading a perfect life.  He is a successful owner of a large and prosperous construction company that builds houses.  He is also married to a beautiful wife, who is expecting their first baby.  He has it all, a beautiful house, money, happy marriage...the only problem he has is with one of his foremans...who happens to be a knucklehead and an ex-felon.  One day, a situation transpires and the foreman gets fired...from than on the life of Tom Fiorini and his wife will change for worse...much -- much worse...

*The last film to feature Chris Penn (the younger brother of Sean Penn) who died of natural causes in 2006...he died before the film was released.",1445817600,,1095,4.870270270270271
6992826,2,B00SU4PFWG,"To the director, if you really want to see what dark comedy looks like, try studying:

This is the end
Dr Strangeglove
Evil dead- Dead by dawn
Burn after reading

Because, what you have here........is not even remotely funny, on any level, in any part of the film.",1445040000,,264,4.479166666666667
6992827,4,B00SU4PFWG,"Aftermath is like Peckinpaws Straw Dogs and Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs and True Romance and Scorseses  Cape Fear.  It transfers all the tension and threat of those movies to a construction site.

It accurately captures the threats humanity knows are just below the surface: ones which no sane person ever wishes to be loosed. Beneath our thin veneer of civilization, we know there lives evil, vicious, chaotic tendencies.  Aftermath reveals this dark truth and makes us feel its horror.

An opening flashback establishes what will follow; the flaws of in the characters mark the inevitability of the actions to come; a sense of raw tension pulses, grips, and moves in one terrifying, undeviating direction.

(There are touches that mar Aftermath: weird fonts are used for credits and recording dates; some interesting cartoon and comic book graphics ((there should have been more or they should have been dropped entirely)) and  an air of the choppy and rushed and Ill-considered scenes that detract and distract from the movies' end.  These flaws prompt my choice four stars which is sad because the movie could so easily have been a 5 star classic.)

Actors, director, and the production in general created a powerful experience where we only feel mounting fear.  All the acting is arresting and powerful.  The principals are remarkable and create a foundation on which supporting actors could create toughs and thugs and monsters the like of which we have never seen before and would never wish to meet in the real world.

Aftermath is in the best sense a B movie.  It is fairly well crafted, draws out the best many concerned.  It was probably done on the cheap, although that is only my guess and a small budget does not necessarily detract from the raw and gritty reality of most of the movie.

Frankly, I think Aftermath would scare Max Cady (both the Mitchum and De Niro characterizations) and it marks, if such was meant to be, a final performance by Chris Penn of great merit.",1441670400,,1985,4.883582089552239
6992828,2,B00SU4PFWG,not sure exactly what this movie was about...seems like an unfinished script or a poor attempt to imitate a Quentin Tarantino type of movie.,1440374400,,140,4.875

6992831,1,B00SU4PFWG,They actually filmed portions at my house.  It is the worst I have ever seen,1433721600,,76,4.066666666666666
6992832,5,B00SU4PFWG,Very very good for an indie movie... a pleasant surprise!,1433721600,,57,4.8
6992833,5,B00SU4PFWG,"A fun and interesting movie with an all star cast. If you like Anthony Michael Hall, Chris Penn, Tony Danza and Frank Whaley, you will probably like this.",1433289600,,154,4.535714285714286
6992834,1,B00SU4PFWG,I haven't even seen the trailer and I know this film is garbage. There was never any hope. I know the actor and he is second rate. He would ruin any script.,1432857600,,156,3.90625
6992835,3,B00SU4PFWG,"This is s solid and surprising little indie.  It is definitely worth a watch if only to see Chris Penn & Anthony Michael Hall who both give strong performances, though sadly it's Chris Penn's last.  That being said, there really isn't much story development or evolution of character in this film.  It's edited in an off beat, comic book kind of way which at times is fun and at others, feels superfluous but I was enjoying myself enough to not really care.  Chris Penn is a power house and his intimidating power can be felt through the screen.  It's that palatable.  Anthony Michael Hall has really grown up and he looks and sounds like a totally different person in this film  That alone was compelling.  There are a few other people in more minor roles but as the story doesn't delve past skin deep for very long, there's not much else worth mentioning.  I liked this film.  It was great to see these guys play off of each other but if you're looking for something layered and profound, I don't think you'll find it here.  Treat it for what it is and it''s a fun ride.",1431907200,2,1072,4.418367346938775
6992836,1,B00SU4PFWG,"If you like movies about a bunch of people that never use any part of their brain above the reptilian complex, you'll love this.  The best thing about the movie is that they get what they deserve.",1431820800,,196,4.297297297297297

6992838,5,B00SU4PFWG,"Fast moving film, enjoyed very much. Good review in LA Times got me to watch and glad I did. Great cinematography, super cut. Anyone who enjoys seeing filmmaking done serious, this film is for you!",1430265600,,197,4.6571428571428575
6992839,5,B00SU4PFWG,Entertaining from beginning to end! Superb acting and incredible cinematography! Very enjoyable! Check it out.,1430179200,,110,6.4
6992840,5,B00SU4PFWG,"Good delivery by the actors! It reminds me of the old film movies with the storyboarding, chapters and text in the film. Tom has presented a unique style and that is what makes independent films exciting. I would doubt that most people realize that approximately 50,000 movies are made and released in a year.",1430179200,,309,4.7407407407407405
6992841,1,B00SU4PFWG,"Watched the trailer and became excited because it looked good especially with the actor line-up. Turns out I gambled wrong, the movie is hardly a B class movie. It literally seems as though they filmed it with a consumer level camcorder and thought it would be fun to make a movie with friends. Story line and acting was decent but nothing outside the box, its the horrible audio and terrible video quality that really chops this movie up. Although there was a touch of crude acting and a rushed sense of hurry production....................BOTTOM LINE: Just don't waste your time.",1430092800,4,581,4.878787878787879
6992842,1,B00SU4PFWG,This was not entertaining and not good.  I hope all the 5 star reviewers were highly compensated.,1430006400,6,97,4.705882352941177
6992843,1,B00SU4PFWG,"I'm not sure I saw the same movie as the other reviewers who seem to love this turkey. The cinematography was interesting but the plot was confusing as well as depressing and grim.  To me it failed the major test of a movie - it just wasn't entertaining.  I kept waiting for the 'good' part of the movie, but the credits suddenly started rolling and it was over (except for a few snippets interspersed in the credits).  This movie will not appeal to a general audience (and certainly not kids).  There aren't many movies I wished I had never watched, but this is one of those few.  I want an hour and twenty-two minutes of my life back.",1429920000,5,636,4.3559322033898304
6992844,5,B00SU4PFWG,Suspenseful thriller at every turn with some unique twists and filmmaking to keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing what will happen next!  See it!,1429660800,,155,4.535714285714286
8699302,5,B00SU4PFWG,"Underrated for this suspense thrillers that has excellent acting, a good storyline and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Also, Hall is superb.",1522108800,,145,4.8
8699303,1,B00SU4PFWG,That's almost 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Don't waste your time with this.,1522108800,,86,4.117647058823529
8699304,1,B00SU4PFWG,The director and cinematographer should never be allowed to touch a camera again. I think there might have been some decent performances in this dumpster fire of a story but we will never know. Thats because it appears there was a drunken monkey operating the camera. It's not stylized when the audience can't see or understand what the story is. It's just horrible film making. Shame that this was Chris Penn's last film.,1521417600,,422,4.794520547945205
8699305,1,B00SU4PFWG,There are no words to describe how terrible this movie is.,1521244800,,58,4.363636363636363
8699306,5,B00SU4PFWG,Enough star power and octane that you won't press pause. You will see camera tricks and editing that is original. You won't be able to predict the ending. Watch the beginning of credits too!,1502928000,,190,4.617647058823529
