This is an overpriced program to begin with, but for this company PESI Publishing & Media to willfully put such little effort in editing the presentation so that it would be helpful to the OCN studying nurse is a disgrace.  They don't even provide the actual PowerPoint slide file, merely a low-quality .pdf file with six slides per page making them so small they are nearly impossible to read. The video is exclusively focused on the speaker, not the PowerPoint slide she is pointing to. We don't need to see a woman talking! We need to see the slide she's talking about! Especially for $300?!?  I mean, a youtube newbee could do a better editing job!

I will say this on a positive note, Anna Rodriguez's presentation was informative and thorough. If you can get past the fact that PESI is packaging her presentation in such a slip-shot manner, it could be helpful to the OCN test prep'er....",1450656000,,950,4.780487804878049
