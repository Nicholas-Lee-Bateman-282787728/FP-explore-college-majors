8758822,3,B01EIW5B6I,"But it was barely okay! Keep that in mind, I would not recommend this movie. In the south of Laos, an American doctor (Rossif Sutherland) becomes a fugitive after he intervenes in the sexual assault of a young woman. When the assailant's body is pulled from the Mekong River, Guess who gets the blame. I would sub-title this movie as ""river, mind your business"" Especially overseas for God's sake. I was bored a lot of the time. Sometimes it was a bit exciting but not often. This chucklehead made one bad decision after another and to be honest this type of movie bothers me when someone's idiocy is the basis for the story. And then just when you think well finally, you did the right thing....you mess that up too! I really hated the ending of this tripe. I am angry with myself that I stuck in til the end. Shame on me.",1487721600,,823,4.38562091503268

8758825,1,B01EIW5B6I,"You won't see ""Verified Purchase"" here because I bought the DVD in a real store (in Switzerland). The film is hopelessly boring, Sutherland anything else than a spellbinding hero. Maybe I missed some sort of redeeming social value here, but I don't think so.",1477440000,,258,4.886363636363637
