4961869,3,B00667TPHU,"Iljimae is a great TV show that originally aired on SBS (Korean TV) in full HD.  For whatever reason, the company that distributes the DVDs for this and a number of other series to non-region 3 countries outside of Korea released this in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  It would not be a big deal if they maintained the original widescreen format within 4:3 (black bars would be seen at the top and bottom of the screen), but instead they lopped off the sides of the image.  What's most frustrating, there is no good or legitimate reason to do this to any show or movie.  It is understandable that the series was not released on Blu-ray to maintain the HD quality, but at least maintain the original 16:9 aspect ratio.  Luckily, the picture quality is very good and, honestly, if you haven't seen the widescreen version and you're not a purist about such things, you won't notice anything lacking.

Unfortunately, you will notice the subtitles for this DVD release are absolutely terrible! Although the basic gist of what is being said is accurate, there are significant and distracting errors in spelling, gender, tense and grammar.  Very disappointing.  I've also read on several forums and customer reviews that the subtitles on the Region 3 Korean DVD release are just as bad.

HOWEVER, despite all of this, the series itself is wonderful and if this is the only way you can enjoy it, I think it's worth the purchase.",1327795200,13,1410,4.699186991869919

THEE BEAUTIFUL  LEE JUN KI,  that plays the main character was to fall in love with! Perfect for the part. One minute he's the little hamlets.. every guy.... the next he is ll Jimae helping the picked on and poor. There is a great story in this production and its takes you from when the characters are very young 5 and 6 year old and that beginning. You know the whole story which is great. If ya like Kdrama and like the Ming and Quang and Joeson 14 15 16 century period. You will enjoy this.",1445990400,,656,4.149606299212598

8493742,3,B00667TPHU,"The series had good potential (and is fine in visual terms). But the incongruous humorous episodes, presumably intended to lighten the mood in an otherwise rather tense plot, become quite irritating And it's rather open-ended, as if a sequel had been planned. (Note that ""The Return of Iljimae"" is NOT a sequel to this series.)",1392595200,3,327,4.963636363636364
