8513111,3,B000LXH58G,"This is a good, general overview about pontoon and deck boats.  It does not go into too much depth, unfortunately, and is a bit dated.  I wish it would have addressed anchoring as the initial moderator advised during the intro.  It did not.  Overall there were some very useful parts for the novice 'tooner.  Especially the safety section on ""must have"" equipment, ""ought to have"" and ""nice to have"".  Price of the DVD should have been a little cheaper.",1333497600,,453,4.670886075949367
