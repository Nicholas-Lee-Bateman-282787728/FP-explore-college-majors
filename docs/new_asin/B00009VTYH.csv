1893873,5,B00009VTYH,If you are a fan of Tom of Finland's work this dvd is a must see. A very personal look into his life is supplemented with lots of his work.,1354752000,,139,3.6666666666666665
1893874,3,B00009VTYH,"Tom of Finland achieved iconic status in gay community. This film gives a rare opportunity to watch and listen to the mastermind behind the whole project, to find out how the comics were created etc.
Whether you are a fan or not, I think it's worth to watch it.",1323734400,,261,4.346938775510204
1893875,2,B00009VTYH,"Tom of Finland is the sort of DVD you'll like if you really like this sort of DVD. Part Gay porn (owing a debt to Kenneth Anger) and part documentary, Daddy and the Muscle Academy (Zeitgeist Films) runs a scant hour, just enough time to allow the audience to learn some things never before considered, and supply endless fodder for a certain type of cocktail party.
Touko Laaksonen  was a commercial artist who followed his dream--- and fetishes---into a million-dollar business. Thanks to bootleggers and the nature of selling the business of sex, Laaksonen, as Tom of Finland, gathered a great deal of publicity but little money. His iconic gay drawings from the 50s' body building magazines (not quite porno, not quite art) all the way to important commercial images of the pre-AIDS 80s, will be with us forever.
Body building leather men grunting at each other in dark bars are pretty much a thing of the past and this film scrupulously investigates what is no more. Some archival shots directly related to the artist are interesting, but the recreation of the culture, all but destroyed by progress in gay liberation on the one side and the AIDS crises on the other, barely a decade before the making of the film, falls flat. (The film was completed shortly before Tom's death in 1991.) The artist talks about humanity, but other than a short sequence about his long time companion, the film comes off about as human as Metropolis, only with less humor.
This is not to deny a muscle and leather worshipping subset of the gay and the straight community, nor in any way to denigrate the artist's contributions, but the history of a closeted gay man finding wild success after declaring his sexuality isn't particularly new. And the accoutrements of leather, muscles and S&M toys are neither shocking nor particularly interesting today.
If Tom and his men interest you, by all means rush out (or stride manfully forward) and pick up the DVD. If this doesn't interest you, perhaps a musical or a Ross Hunter film will do.",1271894400,,2022,4.793696275071634
1893876,5,B00009VTYH,"the best study to date i have found of the tom of finland works.
the interview with the artist himself is excellent and shows how to overcome diversity and publish your dreams.
can be enjoyed by everyone .",1238544000,3,205,4.421052631578948
1893877,5,B00009VTYH,"When I saw this in theaters, me and almost every guy in the audience wanted to lick the screen.  This documentary is just as sexy as Tom's work.  The artist is interviewed in Finnish, so (monocultural) Americans that don't like to read subtitles won't like it.  It's full of talk about the leather community and those who find SM scary may dislike this documentary too.  For those who like Tom's work, this is a great way to find out about the man himself.  By interviewing Isaac Julien and talking about Tom's appreciation of black men, this film tries to be racially diverse.  However, it may rub some as being fetishy.  Gay artists have historically been just oppressed as gay authors or gay activists, especially artists who produce obviously homoerotic work.  So Tom and this documentary are milestones in many ways.  I applaud the director's efforts.",1077062400,38,856,4.848275862068966
7993623,4,B00009VTYH,"The ""Tom of Finland"" documentary/biopic is marginally better and very well acted. For all those interested in the Tom of Finland world of homoerotic fantasy and the times in which it was created, this is a must. The first of these images I ever saw were Xerox copies made in someone's office (we'll guess the boss didn't know). The film is definitely better, as are the comics.",1522540800,,377,4.641791044776119
7993624,3,B00009VTYH,"Daddy and the Muscle Academy is a documentary about gay artist Touko Laaksonen, known professionally as Tom of Finland, who is best known for his erotic drawings of uniformed and leather-clad muscled men. Depicted are hundreds of vividly rendered portraits of male models, grouped by subject matter, with emphasis on various forms of fetishism.

The film includes interviews with the artists models, associates, and intimates. The subject matter isn't for everyone, but this is a well-made documentary about a niche artist who achieved widespread fame, a man referred to by the New York Daily News as the Picasso of gay male erotica.

 Basically an interview documentary with some brief reenactments inspired by Toms artwork, the film features Tom himself describing his early life in the Finnish army, in mundane jobs, and how he became inspired to put onto paper his exaggerated masculine fantasies of men in leather, uniforms, and working clothes. Commentaries from friends and critics point out how deeply Toms fantasies have influenced the post-World War II emergent gay subcultures.

Bonus materials on the widescreen Blu-ray release include an interview with Tom of Finland; Tom of Finland sketch slideshow; and trailer. The film is in English and Finnish, with English subtitles.",1517961600,,1287,5.356435643564357
7993625,5,B00009VTYH,"Very good documentary. Of course the subject doesn't speak English, so you will see a lot of sub-titles.  The extras with further interviews w/ Tom go more in depth.  Thee is also an extra showcasing 100 of his drawings.  I wanted to view this to get the back history before the movie of his life and fame comes out soon.",1515542400,,321,4.316666666666666
7993626,4,B00009VTYH,"This film gave me a new lens into the Leatherman subculture and was really informative.  I am a heterosexual male, but one of my best friends is a Leatherman, I have been to about a half dozen Leatherman bars with him, but still did not completely understand the culture, the appeal, or how it started.  This film really gave me a much better perspective and told the story of Tom Finland the erotic artist that I knew nothing about other than seeing some of his drawings in some bars.  Overall I liked the film and have a better understanding of the subculture and think a better understanding of my friend as well.  I recommend this film whether you are a Leatherman or not.  Funny side story:  The first time I went with my friend to a Leatherman bar I thought we were going to a biker bar, I had no idea what a Leatherman even was, nor did I know my friend was homosexual and at the same time my friend had no idea I was just a biker and professional diver, as he assumed I was a Leatherman and did not know I was heterosexual.  At the time it was a shock for both of us, but it made us even better friends, and it opened up my mind to other ways of thinking and understanding, which I think made me a better person.",1511222400,12,1220,4.165957446808511
