8236391,1,B000ZV1R1U,"I purchased this combo manly for the Amazing Mr Blunden.  A fabulous, heartwarming, children's ghost story, that was produced in England in the late 70's.  Sadly the copy was dreadful.  it was a copy of a, copy of a copy, and so poor in quality it was barely watchable.  I should have returned it.",1396051200,,297,4.444444444444445
8236392,5,B000ZV1R1U,Two amazing movies for children and those who loved them years ago and want to feel young again.  Remember watching them in the past or watch for the first time.,1393545600,,161,4.366666666666666
8236393,5,B000ZV1R1U,"This is another 2 movie in one set. I can't say I am a fan of A CT Yankee in King Arthur's Court, but you will find a very early appearance of Paul Rudd and for fans of the original Incredible Hulk tv series, you will get a reminiscent smile as well. (Bill Bixby introduces that film.) Now on to the whole reason I purchased this movie. Back in the 1980's on Saturday Mornings, just before all the kids shows would go off the air, they used to show great kids movies. This was one of them. It was old even then, but it struck home so much I remembered it all my life. I searched high and low for this film over the years, but could only ever find the UK version or VHS. At long last I was able to get my hands on this amazing film that has stood the test of time. My kids love it now  too. The film quality isn't that great, but then it is an early 1970's film and I am sure it is far better quality than you will find anywhere else for such an old film. The story is timeless and can be enjoyed by boys and girls (and parents) alike.",1365984000,,1034,3.9004739336492893
8236394,3,B000ZV1R1U,"Quality is horrible - the same as when we watched it on TV in the 1980s.  But since it's the only copy of Mr. Blunden to be found, it's priceless.",1362355200,,146,3.8666666666666667
8236395,5,B000ZV1R1U,Loved this movie when I was a kid and was very excited to finally obtain a copy.  It is a classic.,1305504000,,98,3.6666666666666665
8236396,5,B000ZV1R1U,"If you like Charles Dickens, then you will love this film.

Children travel back and forth through time to solve the mystery of how to right the wrongs of the past.

Diana Dors had a surprising role and along with the other actors played very convincing characters.

Children may have nightmares, some of the scenes are very scary.",1294358400,,331,4.672413793103448
8236397,1,B000ZV1R1U,"I can't tell you how I enjoyed the movie itself, because the quality of this DVD makes it unwatchable. Poor print, poor transfer.",1257552000,10,129,4.6521739130434785
8236398,1,B000ZV1R1U,Amazing Mr Blunden is a forgotten classic of Seventies English Cinema - but this DVD has the worst picture quality I have ever seen. In fact it is so bad that you can barely even see the titles at the start of the film. It is a mix of an old print and a bad transfer which makes it unwatchable. The movie is great but please avoid this DVD!,1252540800,11,340,3.9420289855072466
8236399,3,B000ZV1R1U,"As a kid I read the book THE GHOSTS by Antonia Barber, and I was curious to see the movie THE AMAZING MR BLUNDEN which was based upon this book. I enjoyed it because it had meaning for me (although I think that the movie has a lot of things that I don't remember being in the book). I get the impression from other sources that it was shown in the UK on tv a lot, and so I think it would have nostalgia value for those people. But for anyone else, the film quality is not great because it's an old film (nothing to do with DVD quality, that's fine). The camera work wasn't as good as today's. For example, with an overhead shot of the characters, you couldn't make out any features or expressions on the faces. I'm not sure it would be your cup of tea unless you had a vested interest, especially since it's not readily available.",1245283200,7,830,4.161490683229814
