8483232,4,B0010BQPS4,"This DVD lesson is very systematic and well organized. The camera also switches between a full view of the teacher and a close-up of the doumbek and hands, which I like very much. It is a very good DVD except for the following aspects which I did not like: The sound is so low, that I had to buy extra loudspeakers, especially when you play along. Another DVD I bought had louder sound, probably because the micro was better placed. The second thing I did not like was: Many exercises are too fast to follow, and the notation is not shown during the playing. The DVD of Amir Naoum is easier to follow for beginners, although this one has a more professional/academic touch.",1246060800,4,673,4.479674796747967
