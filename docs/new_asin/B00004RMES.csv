7921465,4,B00004RMES,"The Trapp Family,also known as Die Trapp-Familie, is a German film that tells the story of the von Trapp family singers based on the musical memoirs of Baroness Maria von Trapp.

It tells the story of Maria,a young woman who gets into the consternation of the nuns in an Austrian convent. This prompted Mother Abbess to send her to become a governess for the seven children of a naval officer and widower,Captain Georg von Trapp. It later leads a romance between Maria and the captain that leads to marriage and eventually a famous group of family singers. In addition to their escape from Austria to Switzerland during World War II,the movie also includes the family seeking singing engagement in the Unites States during the 1950's.

While it may not be as popular and enduring as the Sound Of Music,I think that the movie did a better job of telling the story of the von Trapp family as it focused more on them rather than great songs that it was going to provide nor as to much it was going to entertain the audience. It may not be a timeless movie unlike the movie musical and it could be considered dated as it was released almost 50 years ago. Nevertheless, it still a wonderful film to watch.",1415836800,,1200,4.550925925925926

7921467,5,B00004RMES,"I have films and books related to the family Trapp. It was the only film that I didn't have. And this was the first movie I saw when I moved to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1958. I fell in love with the story. Then I saw ""The Sound of Music"" when I was 14 years old and my feelings continue to grow. When I moved to the U.S. in 1991 I started to buy the films and the books about the family. One day, in Vermont, I heard a woman singing (in a disc in a store) and I asked the clerk ""Who's singing?"". She said ""Elizabeth von Trapp."" I immediately bought 2 discs. When I came home (Colorado) I visited amazon.com and bought more discs. And I wrote to Elizabeth and she responded. The following year, Elizabeth von Trapp went to Breckenridge to sing. My husband and I went and she was kind enough to arrange for us to sit in the first roll. Her voice is the most melodious voice I ever heard. After the concert, she and her husband asked us to sit and talk. I told her about my ""fixation"" on her family. She was impressed that I knew so much about the family (and the actors). She is the granddaughter of Maria von Trapp. Now, I completed my collection with the VHS ""The Trapp Family."" Thanks Amazon for this present.",1392076800,,1212,4.1617021276595745
7921468,5,B00004RMES,"This is the German movie in which the musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein was based....Lot of things were changed for
the stage, and, later, the movie. New songs...new incidents, the end of the musical has nothing to do with the real story...
how the family left Austria, for a new life in America. It was a big success in the 60s, also its sequence, ""Die Trapp Familie in
Amerika"".",1388966400,,381,4.536231884057971
7921469,3,B00004RMES,The sound quality was very poor and wavered markedly at times. I think this should have been mentioned more clearly in the description.,1368835200,,135,4.913043478260869
7921470,5,B00004RMES,"I've been a fan of The Sound of Music since I first saw it as a child on its original release. When I moved to Austria, I was surprised to find that most people there had never heard of The Sound of Music. Even stranger, those who had seen it hated it. After watching Die Trapp-Familie, now I know why.

This is the 1956 German film that inspired Broadway director Vincent J. Donehue to have it adapted it for the American stage. ""The Sound of Music"" borrows some of the same (fictionalized) devices from Die Trapp-Familie: Regimented children marching to their father's naval whistle (the real Captain von Trapp, a kindly father, was a lax disciplinarian); Maria coming to be a governess to all seven children (the real Maria came to tutor only one child, who was bedridden); a bonding session in Maria's room during a violent thunderstorm, and so on. But Broadway (and Hollywood) made some changes that actually make the story less interesting: turning the family's virtuoso folk and classical music into cheap show tunes; changing their manager, Father Wasner, into a mustachioed, unprincipled huckster; and adding a silly (and geographically impossible) chase scene and flight over the mountains on foot to Switzerland, which of course is nowhere near Salzburg. (Had they fled over the mountains shown, they would have come down in Berchtesgaden, on the very mountainside where Hitler's residence and a large SS camp was located.)

This film is packed with more charm than The Sound of Music. Ruth Leuwerik portrays Maria with such a potent combination of innocence and unconscious sex appeal that you know the poor Baron never stands a chance. Julie Andrews's Maria was cute; Leuwerik's is enchanting. The children -- here depicted with their actual names, ages and genders, which Rodgers and Hammerstein changed willy-nilly -- are irresistibly charming.

But the best part, the reason to own this movie even if you don't understand a word of German, is the music. After hearing the spine-tingling, angelic music in this film, no Lonely Goatherd or Do-Re-Mi will ever do it for you again.

Production standards are surprisingly good for Europe in the 1950s. The cinematography, sets, costuming and sound quality are on a par with The Sound of Music, even though the latter was made with a more lavish budget and nearly a decade later.

The one drawback is language. To date, no version I know of is available with English subtitles. I hope that will change, or that some kind soul will take the trouble to post a translated screenplay on the internet.

But if you are a true Sound of Music fan, I would be willing to bet that you will still be fascinated to watch this film. The story is largely familiar - probably the only thing you need to know is that, after the Baron lost all his money in the Depression, the family turned the castle into a successful hotel, and this is depicted in the movie. Most of the rest you will either recognize or can easily figure out.

In all, I feel spoiled after having watched Die Trapp-Familie. The Sound of Music will continue to be a favorite with me, but it will have to take a backseat to its original (and superior) inspiration.",1299888000,11,3176,4.7846715328467155
7921471,5,B00004RMES,"I was in the Navy and stationed in Bremerhaven, Germany in 1959.  Some time that year, the base theater ran a movie called ""The Trapp Family Singers"", a wonderful, heart-wrenching true story with a happy ending.  But the rights may have been sold to produce ""The Sound of Music"", which followed the exact story line but ""Hollywoodized"" it terribly by making it a musical.  With all due respect, even Christopher Plummer called it ""The Sound of Mucus"".  I would dearly love to find the original version.",1205107200,4,502,4.8023255813953485
7921472,4,B00004RMES,"This English-dubbed version of Die Trapp-Familie is actually an amalgamation of the original German film and its sequel ""Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika"" so substantial footage is missing to make room for the new footage. Don't dismay though, as the film still stands up quite well and has a less open-ended finale than the original German version (which seems to have anticipated a sequel.)

The story is much the same as the later ""Sound of Music"" as Rogers and Hammerstein actually bought the rights to the two German films as well as Maria Von Trapp's memoirs to write their musical.

The dubbing is atrocious, but the great performances by the leads still shine through. Worth picking up even if you're just curious, as it's *slightly* closer to fact than the later musical version (although it still takes quite a few liberties.

Most English copies I've seen have been in a very poor state that doesn't do justice to the fine cinematography. It might sound as if I'm talking the film down, I'm not. The performances are wonderful, the music is delightful and Ruth Leuwerik and Hans Holt shine as the Von Trapps.

Worth your while, absolutely. The German version of this film (and the sequel) are available from the German branch of Amazon as well.  Check out all three, they're great!",1148256000,12,1288,4.836363636363636
7921473,4,B00004RMES,"I only gave it 4 stars because they need to remaster it. There are splices and it looks like a 45 year old film. If it ever comes out on DVD, they'd better find the original negative and make a new print for the transfer. Now the story. If you LOVE The Sound Of Music, you'll LIKE this. It is well done, fine acting and it takes the story a step further than ""SOM"". They actually show the family going to America and seeking singing engagements. And although it doesn't have the additional beauty of Julie Andrews and Charmian Carr it does have Ruth Leuwerik, whom I feel is a most beautiful German actress. (She plays Maria). All in all a good film.",1145491200,3,650,4.2926829268292686
