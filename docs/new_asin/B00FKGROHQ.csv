8616366,3,B00FKGROHQ,"The movie is ok until the last half. The story is fine, but a little too ""forced"", that being said, the characters seem a little too rehearsed. Not sure I am clear in my review, but I hope I am making my point. Good well-seasoned actors mixef with new not-too-good ones. Good film, but too pricey for his quality. I paid less to purchase El Aura, a way, way better argentinian film.",1425600000,,382,4.319444444444445
8616367,5,B00FKGROHQ,"THE BODY (EL CUERPO) is one of those thrillers that grips you at the beginning and never lets go till the very end.  The plot is straightforward: &Aacute;lex Ulloa (Hugo Silva) has suffered a sudden bereavement, as his wife Mayka (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) has died of a heart attack.  The corpse has been taken to the morgue without a postmortem, but has mysteriously disappeared.  The morgue security-guard Torres (Miquel Gelabert) has been scared out of his wits - so much so that he runs out of the building and is knocked down by a car.  Inspector Jaime Pe&ntilde;a (Jos&eacute; Coronado) investigates the crime, but finds the task difficult as he is still plagued by the memory of his wife's death a decade earlier in a hit-and-run accident.  Sometimes his emotions get the better of him.

Set largely in and around the morgue, Oriol Paulo's film is a masterpiece of modern film noir, complete with dark shadows, long tracking shots down corridors, and point-of-view shots where we share the protagonists' uncertainties about what is going on.  To complicate the plot still further, he introduces flashbacks into the past lives of Jamie and &Aacute;lex, to show how the past exerts an almost paralyzing influence over the present.

The action takes place one dark night, where the rain pours down outside, confining all the characters to the claustrophobic space of the morgue.  Within that space, Jaime apparently tries his best to tease out the truth of the crime, but &Aacute;lex keeps resisting him.  On the other hand, &Aacute;lex tries to communicate with his girlfriend Carla (Aura Garrido), in an attempt to elope with her, but finds his endeavors continually frustrated by circumstances.  Neither he nor Jaime can apparently obtain what they want.  In this disordered environment, the logic of cause and effect has been deliberately disrupted.

As the action unfolds, so director Paulo further complicates the action by introducing sequence that represent projections of the protagonists' imagination; in other words, putting their assumptions on screen.  This further complicates our comprehension of the plot; we have no idea how to separate 'truth' from 'fiction'.  This confusion makes the d&eacute;nouement all the more shocking.

Brilliantly performed, with Coronado giving a quite outstanding performance as the guilt-ridden inspector, THE BODY deserves to be considered a modern classic.",1412553600,3,2404,5.286842105263158
8616368,5,B00FKGROHQ,"Very good movie! It's a thriller to be sure, very suspenseful and completely worth watching.",1410307200,3,92,5.2
8616369,5,B00FKGROHQ,This might be more of a 4 star movie but I'm giving it 5 stars on the twist of an ending alone. Excellent acting and storytelling. The Orphanage and Julia's Eyes are also very good.,1405123200,3,181,4.2
