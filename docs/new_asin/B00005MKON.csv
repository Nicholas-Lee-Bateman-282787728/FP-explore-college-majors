1625689,5,B00005MKON,"Annoyed that I couldn't find a listing of all the Hammer Productions included in this Box Set before buying it, I took the liberty of going and getting one. What I found was this set contained many great titles, some of them quite hard to find (and impossible to locate on DVD) mixed with some films that were adequate. For the price, for the quality of the DVD transfer that isn't the best but is pretty good, and for those great pieces, however, its well worth picking up.
And now for a listing of the 4 DVDs:
Volume 1
Witching Time
The Thirteenth Reunion
Rude Awakening
Volume 2
Growing Pains
The House that Bled to Death
Charlie Boy
Volume 3
The Silent Scream
Children of the Full Moon
Carpathian Eagle
Volume 4
Guardian of the Abyss
Visitor of the Grave
The Two Faces of Evil
The Mask of Satan",1027641600,202,798,4.3624161073825505
1625690,4,B00005MKON,"While we have to patiently wait for Warner Brothers to decide to release the original Hammer Dracula and Frankenstien entries on DVD (AN ABLSOLUTE CRIME), this will have to do.
An excellent collection...fun and enjoyable, often full of, get this, ideas that have not been rehashed over and over again (remind you of the current theatre releases?).
Some are better than others, with the Silent Scream rising above the rest riding Peter Crushing's performance.  Solid quality, fun, and enjoyable.
Note:  Not for the MTV horror crowd...it actually attempts to tell a story behind the violence.
Thanks A&E.

1625691,5,B00005MKON,"I remember when this was first aired on British TV.  I was around 6 years of age at the time and remember always getting to watch the first 5 minutes then being sent to bed - 9pm on Saturday night was very late for me then!!
Anyway, a few episodes were repeated around 5 years later, must have been around 1985 and I managed to watch some of them in whole.  The one I remember vividly was Witching Time.  The thing that I liked about these short films was they were set in England which was a change from all the US stuff we get all the time over here.  There are some good twists and I don't think any of them have a happy ending.  Each episode is completely individual and with the running time of 50 minutes alot is packed in and gets straight to the point.  There are a couple of shady episodes however but the good ones more than make up for these.",1011571200,7,853,4.077844311377246

1625705,4,B00005MKON,"I've always love the Hammer films of horror/terror genre, and this tv series is alright, for I wanted the story of Kathryn Leigh Scott's character of comming back as a ghost, which is the one reason why I purchased it. The tv  formatis, of course, better without corporation's interrupting commercials between scenes, plus it lacks the much more leeway & less stricter coporate censorship viewing audience limitations, and a less much more ""horror"" tension, as well as the titilation that the big screen movies always seem to have.

of a few episodes from other collectors. Glad to have the full series. Those who say this isn't Hammer or as good or boring just don't like

1625742,5,B00005MKON,"I'd never seen this 1980 series before, but a friend who's a horror fan told me about it so I took a chance. Hammer's TV venture was interesting--15 original teleplays, about 50 minutes each, with British stars of the day in stories of suspense and the supernatural. They're not all gems, but I'm so impressed with the effort that I'm giving it 5 stars anyway. Too bad we don't have anything like this on TV these days, to say nothing of Thriller, Outer Limits, and Twilight Zone. Oh, well, we can still enjoy these. It's a nice package, with clear picture and sound on all the stories. Recommended for those who like vintage thrills.",1445904000,,634,4.5701754385964914
1625743,2,B00005MKON,"While I'm a big horror and hammer fan, this series is not up to Hammer or my standards.
First off there were only a handful of episodes which had any sense of closure or horrific shock ending, or shocks at all.
Most episodes generate some Hammer ambiance with the locals, but script wise there is no real heft, and the episodes are rather tedious and unfulfilling...
Compared to say night gallery, the hammer house of horror is severely lacking in twists and surprise endings, and is as impressive as a gardeners shack.",1445904000,3,519,4.6521739130434785

1625796,5,B00005MKON,"Friday night is horror night every week of the year in my house, so finding great entertainment to keep me (and my sometime dinner guests) entertained is not easy. That said I do have almost ever Hammer Movie ever made and wanted to check out the series they produced for television. In 1980, Hammer took over the old Hampden Manor House in the heartland of England and produced a series of thirteen horror stories to air on British television.
This set delivered thirteen great nights of entertainment that brought out the supernatural, the bizarre and the down right weird to the small screen. Very similar to Roald Dahl's ""Tales of the Unexpected"", I actually thought these thirteen very different and original stories were better. Each story kept you guessing right to the end. I loved all of them and cannot say which ones were my favorite.
They are packaged very well and could do without the introductory segments you can opt to watch in advance of each episode. The host is an annoying choice and just grates on me with his pointless commentary.
I'm just disappointed that only these few episodes were made, because they are addictive! No doubt they will be watched all over again in a few months!",1411257600,4,1205,4.742857142857143

1625801,5,B00005MKON,"I haven't watched them all yet, savoring each episode, but so far I love it.  I did not know about this show until I became obsessed with Hammer films several years ago.  I had found a single dvd used at Rasputin's in Concord CA, but it only contained 2 or 3 episodes.  I was extremely stoked to find the complete set for such a low price.  The show is really cool as it comes complete with gore, nudity, and that unmistakable Hammer style.  If you like anthology horror, you can't go wrong.  Belongs right next your Tales From The Crypt and Twilight Zone sets.

**update**

Still enjoying this set and wanted to comment to others about this show not being scary enough.  I seriously don't understand why people except older shows to have the same impact as modern day productions.  If you watch the original King Kong it doesn't seem scary to our contemporary eyes, but that doesn't make it bad!  It's from another era and without the old shows we wouldn't have progressed to where we are now.  It's like saying old Rock N Roll isn't that good because of the one track recording process!  How was Elvis considered shocking?",1400371200,7,1124,4.532338308457711

1625803,4,B00005MKON,"Hammer Horror is a name most of us have seen in its slew of films.  It was even honored by Kate Bush's Hammer Horror.  Hammer presented the best of our horror legends like Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee as the quarreling duo in the Dracula/Van Helsing roustabouts.  Then, they added their tastes to television with the Hammer House of Horror.  These are a coven's thirteen stories from the first Witching Time to the last in its collection The Mark of Satan.  They took the genres in the realm of horror and created an hour's worth of story with the best talents availalable in acting and directing.  Not all the stories will appeal to you as some were ""meh"" but at least they tried.  This collection is worth your time and money.  Now, my time has come to declare my own favorites.  Rude Awakening is one of those strange and catch 'em stories with a great punchline,  Carpathian Eagle is one of those stories catching you by your knickers and giving the old jerk up the backside.  Those looking for the traditional and stylish will find their pleasure with Children of the Full Moon and Guardian of the Abyss.  The Silent Scream brings the incredible Peter Cushing into the bravura performance designed to Chill You.

1625823,5,B00005MKON,"Hammer House of Horror
I never watched any of the Hammer House of Horror anthology series until about a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent story lines and above average acting. The series, produced by Hammer Films in 1980 consists of 13 episodes running around 51 minutes each. There is variety in the episodes, all of which are stand alone episodes, and some are supernatural in theme while others are not. What the episodes share in common though is that each episode has a high level of suspense, some plot twists, and a couple of scares thrown in for good measure.

Witching Time
A 17th century witch appears in 20th century England, specifically at the rural retreat of a TV composer (played by Jon Finch) and proceeds to terrorize him. Initially, his wife (who has been living in the city and has been unfaithful) does not believe him thinking he is hallucinating and mentally disturbed but she is convinced soon enough. The witch is played by Patricia Quinn, who gets very annoying with her less than convincing witches' cackling, and it is the wife who is convincingly portrayed - going all out to discover what/who the witch is and how to put an end to her specter.

The Thirteenth Reunion
A Fleet street journalist goes undercover to investigate the sinister goings-on at a slimming clinic that employs unconventional methods to trim down the customers.

Rude Awakening
In this episode, Rude Awakening, Denholm Elliott plays estate agent Norman Shenley who is trapped in a dull marriage to his plain Jane wife and fantasizes about a new life with his secretary Lolly. One day, a mysterious man turns up at the office asking if Norman would check out an old manor home in the country which he plans to put up for sale on behalf of the owners. Here is where things begin to go very wrong - Norman shows up at the empty house and witnesses something terrifying, but then finds himself coming out of a nightmare. He keeps experiencing this dream/nightmare episodes until the lines between reality and fantasy become very blurred. Is Norman losing his mind or is he the victim of some malicious plan?

I don't particularly like this episode as it's not the type of horror story that I appreciate but I did enjoy Elliott's credible portrayal of a man slowly descending into an abyss of horror.

Growing Pains
An antique book serves as a conduit for the resurrection of a malevolent spirit.

The House that Bled to Death
In The House that Bled to Death, a young family moves into a dilapidated house because it is the only one they can afford. The house has a dark secret which the new occupants are unaware of, i.e. an old man had butchered his wife in it and buried her remains in the garden. Soon enough, strange occurrences plague the family, including their young daughter who is terrified of living in the house. The neighbors across the street are a well-meaning couple and the wife in particular struggles with whether she should tell the family what happened there years earlier.

Suspense abounds in this tale though I admit some of the effects are rather cheesy by today's standards. However, there is a strong sense of looming menace and the acting is top-notch.

Charlie Boy
A man inherits his late uncle's artwork and his girlfriend expresses a particular interest in an African fetish doll with bits stuck in it. A series of bizarre deaths leads the man to suspect it is linked to the African fetish doll and discovers to his horror that he and his girlfriend may be the next targets. Can he undo what has been unleashed or pay the price for ill intentions?

This is one of the more suspenseful stories in this anthology. The suspense keeps building up and even though I sort of predicted the ending, it still gave me the chills.

The Silent Scream
I had been looking forward to viewing The Silent Scream because one of my all-time favorite horror actors, Peter Cushing plays a major role in it. I was not disappointed. In this episode, Brian Cox plays a prisoner who is visited by Peter Cushing's character while serving time in prison. Cushing's character gives Cox's character some money and wishes him well. When Cox's character is released from prison, he reunites with his young wife and then visits the pet shop which Cushing's character owns to express his gratitude. Whilst at the store, he discovers that Cushing is no mere pet store owner, but a man who is deep into psychological experimentation involving wild animals. Unbeknownst to Cox's character, he is the next intended target for experimentation.

This is one the best episodes in this anthology - a true exploration of the darker recesses of the human heart and mind, and man's capacity for cruelty. This is psychological horror at its best.

Children of the Full Moon
In Children of the Full Moon (one of my favorites in this series), a young successful couple find themselves stranded in a remote country area when their car goes off the road. The couple finds a large manor house deep in the woods, and upon knocking, receive an overly warm welcome by the caretaker of the house, a benign-looking older woman. The husband is unable to call for help and the wife finds that the house has other occupants namely a 'pack' of children of varying ages and looks, all beautiful. There is definitely something odd though - the children stay up way past their bedtime and their mannerisms are decidedly odd. The couple stay the night but something sinister awaits them.

I was glad to see the story take a twist in a direction that though not completely unexpected, kept me engaged and in suspense till the end. The stellar acting by the ensemble cast especially the role of the caretaker (played by Diana Dors) was enough to inspire chills by her very words.

The Carpathian Eagle
In The Carpathian Eagle, a police inspector (played by Anthony Valentine) is determined to solve a string of serial killings. Men have been murdered in the most gruesome manner and the similar pattern convinces the inspector that a serial killer is at large. Investigations reveal the murderer could be a woman, and the inspector zeroes in on one suspect, a female researcher working on some material for a book (played by Suzanne Danielle). Let's just say the story has plenty of suspense and the plot twists will keep viewers at the edge of their seats. Pierce Brosnan plays a very small role here too.

Guardian of the Abyss
In Guardian of the Abyss, occultists are planning on resurrecting a gatekeeper demon and need the perfect sacrifice. Unfortunately, one victim goes crazy and another escapes. The young woman who escapes runs into the path of an oncoming car driven by a man who is also an antiques dealer. As fate would have it, the antiques dealer has taken temporary possession of an ancient scrying glass believed to have been made by a famous ancient occultist. The present-day occultists are after both the woman and the scrying glass and the entire story centers around this. Though it felt dragged out in parts, I enjoyed it for the most part because there are a couple of twists in the plot which kept things interesting.

Visitor from the Grave
I was underwhelmed by the plot in ""Visitor from the Grave"". A young, emotionally unstable American heiress (played by Katherine Leigh Scott) shoots a man in self-defense when the man attempts to rape her. She is found the next morning, delirious and hysterical by her boyfriend (played by Simon Macorkindale) and he aids her by covering up the death and burying the dead man's body in the woods.

Soon enough, the heiress begins to have disturbing visions of the dead man and is convinced that she is haunted by the man's ghost. The trouble with this plot is that it's not original and I was able to figure out what was going on almost from the very beginning. The heiress came across as whiny and just got on my nerves, so it was difficult to actually sympathize with her plight. By the time the climax came, I was ready to move on to the next episode. This is one of the more underwhelming stories in the series, at least in my opinion.

The Two Faces of Evil
The Two Faces of Evil is quite scary and contains some surreal elements. A family of three (dad, mom, and young son) are on their way to a holiday cottage when they pick up a hitchhiker and soon after a struggle breaks out between the hitchhiker and the dad. The wife awakens in hospital to find her son is fine but her husband has suffered some injuries, particularly around the throat area and is unable to speak for a while. The wife is the only one who is able to voice that she saw the hitchhiker attack her husband but recoils when asked to identify the body of the hitchhiker who was purportedly killed in the altercation.

Soon after, the wife and son go off to the cottage while the husband recuperates in the hospital. The wife is suffering from PTSD and keeps experiencing flashbacks of the incident. When the husband arrives at the cottage, the wife makes a startling discovery - is she losing her mind, or has a doppelganger taken over her husband's body? There are quite a few scary twists in this terrifying tale. I think I might have to view it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time around. Like several other well-made stories in this anthology, repeat viewings reveal more that eluded the eyes the first time.

The Mark of Satan
A man begins to see the number ""9"" all over, and suspects that sinister forces have been unleashed.

Conclusion - I'd recommend this series to all fans of classic horror, especially those who are nostalgic for Hammer productions.",1382486400,43,9613,4.679692125518058

Initially, his wife (who has been living in the city and has been unfaithful) does not believe him thinking he is hallucinating and mentally disturbed but she is convinced soon enough. The witch is played by Patricia Quinn, who gets very annoying with her less than convincing witches' cackling, and it is the wife who is convincingly portrayed - going all out to discover what/who the witch is and how to put an end to her specter.

The Thirteenth Reunion
A Fleet street journalist goes undercover to investigate the sinister goings-on at a slimming clinic that employs unconventional methods to trim down the customers.

Rude Awakening
In this episode, Rude Awakening, Denholm Elliott plays estate agent Norman Shenley who is trapped in a dull marriage to his plain Jane wife and fantasizes about a new life with his secretary Lolly. One day, a mysterious man turns up at the office asking if Norman would check out an old manor home in the country which he plans to put up for sale on behalf of the owners. Here is where things begin to go very wrong - Norman shows up at the empty house and witnesses something terrifying, but then finds himself coming out of a nightmare. He keeps experiencing this dream/nightmare episodes until the lines between reality and fantasy become very blurred. Is Norman losing his mind or is he the victim of some malicious plan?

I don't particularly like this episode as it's not the type of horror story that I appreciate but I did enjoy Elliott's credible portrayal of a man slowly descending into an abyss of horror.

Growing Pains
An antique book serves as a conduit for the resurrection of a malevolent spirit.

The House that Bled to Death
In The House that Bled to Death, a young family moves into a dilapidated house because it is the only one they can afford. The house has a dark secret which the new occupants are unaware of, i.e. an old man had butchered his wife in it and buried her remains in the garden. Soon enough, strange occurrences plague the family, including their young daughter who is terrified of living in the house. The neighbors across the street are a well-meaning couple and the wife in particular struggles with whether she should tell the family what happened there years earlier.

Suspense abounds in this tale though I admit some of the effects are rather cheesy by today's standards. However, there is a strong sense of looming menace and the acting is top-notch.

Charlie Boy
A man inherits his late uncle's artwork and his girlfriend expresses a particular interest in an African fetish doll with bits stuck in it. A series of bizarre deaths leads the man to suspect it is linked to the African fetish doll and discovers to his horror that he and his girlfriend may be the next targets. Can he undo what has been unleashed or pay the price for ill intentions?

This is one of the more suspenseful stories in this anthology. The suspense keeps building up and even though I sort of predicted the ending, it still gave me the chills.

The Silent Scream
I had been looking forward to viewing The Silent Scream because one of my all-time favorite horror actors, Peter Cushing plays a major role in it. I was not disappointed. In this episode, Brian Cox plays a prisoner who is visited by Peter Cushing's character while serving time in prison. Cushing's character gives Cox's character some money and wishes him well. When Cox's character is released from prison, he reunites with his young wife and then visits the pet shop which Cushing's character owns to express his gratitude. Whilst at the store, he discovers that Cushing is no mere pet store owner, but a man who is deep into psychological experimentation involving wild animals. Unbeknownst to Cox's character, he is the next intended target for experimentation.

This is one the best episodes in this anthology - a true exploration of the darker recesses of the human heart and mind, and man's capacity for cruelty. This is psychological horror at its best.

Children of the Full Moon
In Children of the Full Moon (one of my favorites in this series), a young successful couple find themselves stranded in a remote country area when their car goes off the road. The couple finds a large manor house deep in the woods, and upon knocking, receive an overly warm welcome by the caretaker of the house, a benign-looking older woman. The husband is unable to call for help and the wife finds that the house has other occupants namely a 'pack' of children of varying ages and looks, all beautiful. There is definitely something odd though - the children stay up way past their bedtime and their mannerisms are decidedly odd. The couple stay the night but something sinister awaits them.

I was glad to see the story take a twist in a direction that though not completely unexpected, kept me engaged and in suspense till the end. The stellar acting by the ensemble cast especially the role of the caretaker (played by Diana Dors) was enough to inspire chills by her very words.

The Carpathian Eagle
In The Carpathian Eagle, a police inspector (played by Anthony Valentine) is determined to solve a string of serial killings. Men have been murdered in the most gruesome manner and the similar pattern convinces the inspector that a serial killer is at large. Investigations reveal the murderer could be a woman, and the inspector zeroes in on one suspect, a female researcher working on some material for a book (played by Suzanne Danielle). Let's just say the story has plenty of suspense and the plot twists will keep viewers at the edge of their seats. Pierce Brosnan plays a very small role here too.

Guardian of the Abyss
In Guardian of the Abyss, occultists are planning on resurrecting a gatekeeper demon and need the perfect sacrifice. Unfortunately, one victim goes crazy and another escapes. The young woman who escapes runs into the path of an oncoming car driven by a man who is also an antiques dealer. As fate would have it, the antiques dealer has taken temporary possession of an ancient scrying glass believed to have been made by a famous ancient occultist. The present-day occultists are after both the woman and the scrying glass and the entire story centers around this. Though it felt dragged out in parts, I enjoyed it for the most part because there are a couple of twists in the plot which kept things interesting.

Visitor from the Grave
I was underwhelmed by the plot in ""Visitor from the Grave"". A young, emotionally unstable American heiress (played by Katherine Leigh Scott) shoots a man in self-defense when the man attempts to rape her. She is found the next morning, delirious and hysterical by her boyfriend (played by Simon Macorkindale) and he aids her by covering up the death and burying the dead man's body in the woods.

Soon enough, the heiress begins to have disturbing visions of the dead man and is convinced that she is haunted by the man's ghost. The trouble with this plot is that it's not original and I was able to figure out what was going on almost from the very beginning. The heiress came across as whiny and just got on my nerves, so it was difficult to actually sympathize with her plight. By the time the climax came, I was ready to move on to the next episode. This is one of the more underwhelming stories in the series, at least in my opinion.

The Two Faces of Evil
The Two Faces of Evil is quite scary and contains some surreal elements. A family of three (dad, mom, and young son) are on their way to a holiday cottage when they pick up a hitchhiker and soon after a struggle breaks out between the hitchhiker and the dad. The wife awakens in hospital to find her son is fine but her husband has suffered some injuries, particularly around the throat area and is unable to speak for a while. The wife is the only one who is able to voice that she saw the hitchhiker attack her husband but recoils when asked to identify the body of the hitchhiker who was purportedly killed in the altercation.

Soon after, the wife and son go off to the cottage while the husband recuperates in the hospital. The wife is suffering from PTSD and keeps experiencing flashbacks of the incident. When the husband arrives at the cottage, the wife makes a startling discovery - is she losing her mind, or has a doppelganger taken over her husband's body? There are quite a few scary twists in this terrifying tale. I think I might have to view it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time around. Like several other well-made stories in this anthology, repeat viewings reveal more that eluded the eyes the first time.

The Mark of Satan
A man begins to see the number ""9"" all over, and suspects that sinister forces have been unleashed.

1625878,4,B00005MKON,"One of the last gasps from Hammer before the studio closed its doors in the 80's (only to reopen under new management within the last decade), this single season TV series ran back in 1980 and, with a Night Gallery - The Complete First Season vibe, allowed Hammer to close out their history with a solid project. This reissue from Synapse films is nice featuring the UK versions of the shows without any PAL issues (meaning it doesn't sound like anyone is sucking helium when they speak).

There is some minor distortion on the audio for ""Visitor from the Grave"" during a brief sequence but, aside from that, the audio is clear and presented in its original mono.

Featuring a variety of guest stars including Brian Cox (""Manhunter"", ""The Bourne Supermacy""), Peter Cushing (""Curse of Frankenstein"", ""Star Wars""), Denholm Elliot (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""), Jon Finch (""Frenzy""), Katherine Leight Scott (""Dark Shadows""), Sin Phillips (""I, Claudius"") and a small role featuring Pierce Brosnan (James Bond of course and ""Remington Steele"")among others, the series featured some top notch horror directors that had worked for Hammer before (Peter Sasdy,Don Sharp, Tom Clegg).

Among the outstanding episodes are ""The House That Bled Blood"", ""Visitor from the Grave"", ""The Two Faces of Evil"", ""The Silent Scream"" (a surprisingly powerful episode but you should stick with it to the end) and ""The Mark of Satan"". There are, of course, a couple of cringe worthy episodes as well but, on the whole, the series is remarkably good and consistent. If nothing else, the series is worthwhile for the strong performances from the cast.

There are a handful of duds but, on the whole, the writing and direction is pretty good.
This reissue features remastered episodes, a crisp picture that doesn't suffer from any PAL issues. The mono audio sounds pretty good with nice presence.

We get a couple of very good extras. Each episode features an introduction by Video Watchdog writer, filmmaker and horror host Shane M. Dallmann (that are pretty succint) as well as interviews with Katherine Leight Scott and Mia Nadasi discussing their work on the show.

The filmography and text essay from the 2001 release are not included here.

I would have liked to see a commentary track or two from the surviving members of the cast and/or crew but, given that we get fresh, nice looking transfers, I'm willing to overlook this minor issue.

I do wish that the series had subtitles or at least a close captioned option.

Each disc includes three episodes and we get a total of five discs (except for the last disc which also features the supplements). Although I don't care for the overlapping DVD holders, these are a minor annoyance (and most fans could transfer them to another holder).

Although this set is missing some essentials (subtitles, a commentary track or two), ""Hammer House of Horror"" includes all the unedited episodes as they were originally broadcast in the UK and no PAL speed issues with a series of nice transfers.",1357862400,67,3010,4.9425742574257425

For the longest time it has been out of print, and the cheapest price used is $32, and new $70. I will not pay that much. But thankfully Synapse company, who has recently been releasing Hammer on Blu-Ray, just a few though, has decided to re-release this set. I know I will be buying this wonderful 80's Hammer tv show. Hopefully so will a lot of people so it stays in print. Pre-order now, and be filled with awesome Hammer Horror.

Edit: Also the picture for this set and sound quality is great. The reason I give the set 4 stars and not 5 is because, unfortunately there aren't any commentaries or behind the scenes looks at what Hammer House of Horror was like. Before every episode there are little intros talking about each episodes cast and a little trivia that any DIE HARD HAMMER FAN would love, but this is about as far as the special features go. Episodes are wonderful especially ""Children of the Full Moon"" which is a nice werewolf adaption considering that Hammer only made one werewolf movie in ""Curse of the Werewolf"" which is also one of my favorite Hammer movies. Overall wonderful set and very enjoyable for any Hammer Fan or and regular horror fan.

NOTE: If you were lucky enough to acquire an A&E DVD copy of Hammer House of Horror, the only reason for you to acquire this set as well would be the updated picture quality and sound quality and if your into a little bit of back story before every episode, the pre episode intros. Other than that if your A&E version still works, than you should be in good shape. Hope this answered everyone's questions. Thanks.",1342915200,70,1667,4.4983498349834985

You get the whole series here and sadly this was hammers last gasp as a company. They were trying to come back but couldn't. Anyways as a horror fan i was glad to get this cool series that I hadn't seen for so long. The series looks pretty good too here with little damage to the film prints. And this one was shot on film not video tape something most brit series did till the mid 80's. This is old school varied horror and worth collecting.",1293408000,3,749,4.244755244755245
1625909,3,B00005MKON,"I've long been a fan of Hammer Films and even got to see many of the later ones when they were first released but I had never heard of these TV films. Originally made in 1980, they came along at a time when my life was going through a transition phase and I was moving from place to place, so I missed them altogether. Now that I've caught up with them after 30 years, they are definitely a mixed bag. I was expecting them to be like NIGHT GALLERY whose visual style copied the original Hammer look of rich colors and stylized lighting but this set had the look and feel of any British TV show of the period. The programs are solid but undistinguished. In keeping with the later Hammer offerings, there is plenty of Kensington Gore (Hammer's special fake blood mix) and some occasional nudity on display  which should have kept this show off of American TV. Supposedly they aired this series on ABC Mystery of the Week sometime in the 1980s but I don't see how unless they were heavily cut or ABC was very selective. These DVDs come from A&E.

The stories were uneven to say the least with the good ones (GUARDIAN OF THE ABYSS, THE SILENT SCREAM, RUDE AWAKENING) being very good, the bad ones (THE CARPATHIAN EAGLE, THE 13TH REUNION, VISITOR FROM THE GRAVE) being very mediocre, and the others falling somewhere in between. GROWING PAINS, THE TWO FACES OF EVIL and THE MARK OF SATAN were remarkable for the unease they generated much like Hammer's old psychological thrillers of the 1960s. The best episodes had Hammer alumni such as actors Peter Cushing, Jon Finch and John Carson and directors Don Sharp, Peter Sasdy, and Alan Gibson. There are also strong performances from Anna Calder-Marshall and Denholm Elliot that lift their respective stories out of the ordinary. I'm glad I have this collection but I can't say that I'll revisit it anytime soon. Probably a must for Hammer fans but definitely not a complete success. The episodes don't have the staying power of the original films and in fact I've already forgotten some of them.",1267833600,5,2039,4.629834254143646
1625910,4,B00005MKON,"October is when I revisit horror classics, and I happened to see this title pop-up on my list of recommended titles. Upon checking it out (I confess I rented it first to see if I'd really like it enough to purchase the set), I have to say I was quite entertained by the series. Hammer productions have always been fun, especially if they had the greats, Cushing and Lee in them. This series is more contemporary, having debuted in 1980. I did some research on this show, and discovered that filming took place in Buckinghamshire, around Hampden House (formerly a private school), and also in the locality, especially the local church and village of Great Missenden.

The result is a collection of 13 creepy/ghastly tales of the macabre, covering themes such as devil worship, voodoo curses, witches, werewolves, etc. And just like another older series I watched recently ""Tales of the Unexpected"", the endings aren't necessarily happy ones. The score is effectively chilling as is the shots of Hampden House at dusk. The acting talent here is quite impressive, including Peter Cushing himself, Diana Dors, Denholm Elliot, Paul Darrow, and Mr Remington Steele himself, Pierce Brosnan, in a blink and you'll miss it role.

The stories contained on the DVDs are as follows:
Disk 1
Witching Time - rare happy ending in this one.
The Thirteenth Reunion - cannibalistic theme here.
Rude Awakening - a rather dark comedy with Denholm Eliiott

Disk 2
Growing Pains - a tale from beyond the grave where a couple are haunted by the ghost of their dead son. Not very good.
The House the Bled to Death - shocking piece, about a family that moves into a house with an unpleasant past, and of course they discover things are not as they should be. Notable scene is of the children's party where a burst pipe showers blood all over the kiddos. The ending is quite disturbing.
Charlie Boy - voodoo story and quite bloody

Disk 3
The Silent Scream - Peter Cushing plays the role of an ex-Nazi, living a seemingly innocent existence in the present as a pet shop owner, but who is actually experimenting on animals,and decides to extend these diabolical experiments on to humans.
Children of the Full Moon - the token werewolf story.
Carpathian Eagle - a serial killer story, and Pierce Brosnan appears in this one, too predictable for my liking.

Disk 4
Guardian of the Abyss - a Satan worshipping story, with a weak plotline, yet nice twist at the end.
Visitor from the Grave - spooky, and atmospheric.
The Two Faces of Evil - quite a disturbing watch this, with creepy music, stomach-churning scares, doppelgangers etc.
The Mask of Satan - explores paranoia.

Each episode is about 52 minutes in length. The picture quality is average. Overall, I'd recommend this to fans of Hammer horror, and its also quite nostalgic, so definitely worth a watch.",1255305600,2,2832,4.793032786885246
1625911,5,B00005MKON,"Having become obsessed with Hammer's library over the last few years, I simply had to have this set as a completist.

While there are no special features, the episodes themselves are generally at above average quality for a horror anthology (especially compared to more recent anthologies Masters of Horror and Nightmares and Dreamscapes).  Many episodes take on a twilight zone approach where once you know what is going on you are impressed with the idea, but not much else, as many are predictable by today's standards.

But don't let the first disc fool you, production value and substance soon picks up. While never on par with some of Hammer's classics,  House of Horror provides a quick dose of Hammer Horror.

There are a couple of stand outs...  'Growing Pains' and 'The Silent Scream' are my favorites. It was neat to see a Young Brian Cox battle Peter Cushing.

1625915,5,B00005MKON,"First of all let me start by saying that the whole box set of thirteen forty-five minute television programs has a total running time of 670 Minutes! That is over 11 hours of viewing which works out at a cost of just over $4 per episode which is great value if you like a bit of horror entertainment for just under an hour a day for 2 weeks solid. Basically that is how my family watched it. We would do an episode a day and it helped fill that gap after work with a nice cup of tea and biscuits. Anyhow, onto the review.
The Hammer House of Horror Box Set is a must for any fan of Hammer Horror but it is not for everybody. It is more of a nostalgic item which brings back the memory of this old Hammer Horror series from the early 1980s. If you like Hammer Horror and have not seen this series then you should know that it contains more modern stories sort of in the vein of ""Tales of the Unexpected"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" but with all the Hammer hallmarks - corny acting, daft plots and lots of women who are chosen for their looks over their ability to act - and what bad taste the casting directors have!... which is why we love it. There are many actors with bit roles who actually went on to become popular and mainstream like Pierce Brosnan and Brian Cox. Some of the shows are extremely experimental and most of the plots are silly but they are also highly original. It is a case of hit or miss with a lot of them, but you will laugh and enjoy them all the more for it with a sort of ""What the hell was that I just watched?"" grin.
There are 4 discs which break down into 3 + 3 + 3 + 4. The transfer quality is very good, but there are some artifacts in the image but if you do not look for them you will not see them. The only problem I have with the DVD is the fact that you can not just play each program directly. You need to basically choose the first scene in the selection that comes up and you can not help but notice what is in store for each show. It is a bit of problem that should not have been there. There is a small booklet with the box set and some extras like bios and slide show galleries.
I will divide each show into good or fair or bad.
DISK 1:
(1)The House That Bled to Death - GOOD
Basically a story about a haunted house that starts to spurt blood. Memorable kids party scene and a good twist ending.
(2)The Silent Scream - FAIR
Has Peter Cushing and Brian Cox in a story about imprisonment experiments. Good at times but also falls flat in some parts.
(3)The Two Faces of Evil - FAIR
Story about a hitchhiker that causes a car accident. Is her husband really her husband or the deranged hitchhiker? Good at times but falls flat in the end.
DISK 2:
(4)The Mark of Satin - BAD.
About a paranoid man that thinks there is a satanic plot against him. Very experimental piece.
(5)Witching Time - FAIR.
A witch arrives in the future and drives a man mad in his home. Not bad but a little corny at times.
(6)Visitors From the Grave - GOOD
Woman kills a man who tries to rape her - then she starts seeing him again. One of the better programs on this disk. Very good.
DISK 3:
(7)Rude Awakening - FAIR
About a man who keeps have a reoccurring nightmare about killing his wife. Very experimental but not bad.
(8)Charlie Boy - GOOD
Apart from the hammy acting this one is quite good. About a voodoo doll that gets out of control. Actually has a good plot.
(9)Children of the Full Moon - GOOD
You will remember this one if you are a fan of the series. Basically a run in with a werewolf family changes a couples life. Lots of fun.
DISK 4:
(10)The Thirteenth Reunion - GOOD
Starts off really bad and then turns into a great story that is very original. Excellent show.
(11)The Carpathian Eagle - BAD
A silly story about a killer femme-fatal. Has a few moments of Pierce Brosnan with his Oh-irish accent.
(12)Guardian of the Abyss - GOOD
Not a bad story about a cult that uses a mirror to incarnate a demon.
(13)Growing Pains - FAIR
Silly ghost story about a scientist family and an adopted boy. Some good scenes though but a silly ending.
Overall this is a fantastic box set with lots of different stories that vary in theme and type and will keep you entertained. Just remember that each show was produced with less funds than the Hammer Horror Movies and it shows, but all in all great stuff and I am very happy that I bought this box set.
Role on with the DVD box set of ""Hammer House of Mystery of Suspense""!.... or whatever that other series was called.",1066867200,92,4486,4.175317185697809
7945669,5,B00005MKON,"Uneven but still entertaining TV series from Britain's greatest purveyor of cinematic shocks. It's worth owning for the ""Silent Scream"" episode alone. Starring Peter Cushing, it is every bit as good as any big-screen creation from Hammer Films. Cushing is a kindly pet store owner who gives a parolee a shot at redemption -- and that all-important place of employment to satisfy the terms of his release. Don't be surprised if the recipient of Cushing's largess looks familiar. The character is played by Brian Cox, the first actor to play Hannibal Lector (""Manhunter""), Helen Mirren's love interest in ""Red I & 2"" and the keeper of the keys in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" as well as many more memorable movies. The plot twists are unpredictable right up to the shocking climax. Another winner is the episode starring Denholm Elliott (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") as a real estate salesman who begins to question the strange thing happening in his life.",1518134400,,957,4.877300613496932

I don't know why they didn't make more of these episodes.  I especially like the episode ""Rude Awakening"" directed by Peter Sasdy, written by Gerald Savory, and starring Denholm Elliott.  There are also many other good stories with neat twists.",1512950400,,413,5.014705882352941
