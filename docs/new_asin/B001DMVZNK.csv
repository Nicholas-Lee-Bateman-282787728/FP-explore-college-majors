3534602,5,B001DMVZNK,"This would be the last season of the long running M*A*S*H season which is kind of funny as I read once how Alan Alda signed the contract for the first season of M*A*S*H just a couple of hours before they shot the pilot episode as he was afraid to sign thinking it might be a long running series, I for one am glad he did!  In this final Season we see a closer to everything in the 4077.  The third disc is the final episode which is two hours long basically a movie but very powerful with the emotional that was felt during the war and the emotional of saying goodbye for good and watching Hawkeye struggle with the casualties that war sometimes brings.  In this season Klinger gets married and ends up staying in Korea with the girl and there are other memorial episodes.  If your a M*A*S*H fan like me your collection would not be complete without the very last season of MASH.  If you just liked the Season Finial ""Goodbye, Farwell and Amen"" you can by that separate but why not get it with the rest of this season to enjoy as well.",1232409600,43,1035,4.260204081632653

3534607,5,B001DMVZNK,"If you enjoy M A S H then you will enjoy this one.  All of the episodes are great, however a word or two, (way more than two if you have my reviews before). on the last episode named : ""Goodbye, Fairwell and Amen"".  This is no doubt written among others by Alan Alda and it is well written and very well done.  It is true to what I have read and what my Father used to tell me about the war, any war.  However this is not an episode you'd want to see more than once.  Of course that is what I love to do is watch my favorite movies, TV shows and TV movies over and over.  But this one is hard to watch.  It is depressing, sad and altogether too real.  But I do recommend it at least once.  As I remember it was a 2 hr finale so you can't miss the finale of the greatest and most popular TV show in history.  Now I can't imagine anyone having missed it the first time around, but then if you don't or didn't like M A S H then you wouldn't want to see this one.  But I just wanted to mentioned it.
I can watch M A S H s over and over as I mentioned except the finale.  In the meantime enjoy and by season 8 too because that has some really good episodes in it namely: Time Line,, where Hawkeye does an Aortic graft.  I am an RN so naturally I enjoyed it and it is really true to life.

This was my very first time ever seeing the final episode though. I was just a baby when it first aired on TV and the reruns I'd seen on TV would go up to the 2nd to last episode, and then never show the final one. I was surprised at how long it was, but I felt the length was about right. It sure was a sad one though!

As for the product itself, I'm sad to say that it arrived with Disc 2 out of place and the bottom of it was damaged pretty badly. Luckily it seemed to play okay still but it looks horrible and is all scratched to pieces!

3534758,5,B001DMVZNK,Love ALL of MASH series. Didn't get into it until recently. I love watching the antics of all and although war it not pretty I would've loved to been in that unit.

3534760,5,B001DMVZNK,"Why pay $23.99 for just ""Good-bye, Farewell and Amen"" when you can pay $16.49 and get the entire 11th season too!!  That's what I did.

I first watched GFA when it aired in 1983 and I was glued to my little black-and-white TV for the entire 2 1/1 hours, and at the end I was sobbing, especially when the ""Goodbye"" spelled out in rocks was seen from the helicopter.  So I waited and watched for when it would come out on VHS, which it did eventually.  However, my VCR died and I was thinking about getting GFA for DVD.

When I saw I could get the final season as well, I jumped at the chance.  It's a fitting build up to the final episode, and season 11 helps flesh out some of the supporting players.  Truly MASH had matured from the early days with Trapper John.  But I was a little disappointed that the laugh track was so evident--I didn't remember that from watching the series on reruns.  And really there are no stand out episodes, such as the one told entirely from the patient's point of view in an earlier season.

But all in all a must-have for the serious MASH fan.",1282867200,2,1076,4.25615763546798
3534761,5,B001DMVZNK,As other reveiwers have stated all good things must come to an end. But maybe this is for the better as it was better to quit while ahead. Some of the episodes while still enjoyable seem a little tedious. For example the season opener largley consisting of Nurse Kelly jealous of Hawkeye's affection and not much else or the episode about Winchester's snoring. Some of the stries seem to have less to do with the war itself and attempts to escape from it than things like somebody snoring or an ingrown toenail that really were sort of trivial but MASH was still way ahead of the rest and this seems a fitting end before something actually does Jump The Shark and becomes unwatchable and just a bad parody of itself.

3534762,5,B001DMVZNK,"The usual high quality, as seen in prior seasons of this evergreen programme. Pity there were only 11 seasons!  Highly recommended.",1265068800,4,131,5.238095238095238
3534763,5,B001DMVZNK,"I remember still the night the final episode of M*A*S*H aired. the lights went out!!! there were four adaults sitting on a couch n the dark watching on a 5 inch battery powered black and white TV. The power was fading on the batteries at the end of the show. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

This is the best show that ever was and to miss it should be a crime. do yourself and your kids a favore and buy this for them. One day they will thank you for it",1263945600,4,463,3.925531914893617
3534764,5,B001DMVZNK,"The first few episodes of Season 11 showed that it was definitely time for one of the most celebrated shows of television history to close shop: Episodes began to be written featuring characters who had previously only had lines like ""yes, Doctor"" or ""would you like bread with lunch, Major?""

But a lot of thought plainly went into the final moments: it is worth the price of the entire package for only the final two episodes: In ""As Time Goes By"" Margaret decides to lead a group burying a time capsule commemorating their time at the 4077th.  When the boys in The Swamp offer to help she is resistant, knowing the general lack of seriousness from Hawkeye and B.J.  This episode does a good job combining the trademark of the show: M*A*S*H was able to be funnier than almost any show in history, while at the same time addressing serious issues in more depth than almost any other ""drama"".

The finale ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"" remains the most watched television broadcast of all time - over 50 million households were tuned in, which represented more than 60% of the tvs in use, about 10 million more than the highest-rated Super Bowls.  I remember well watching the original broadcast with a large group - the 30 minute sit-com format was turned into a 2 1/2 hour broadcast, and we were riveted for every moment.  Originally, we were disconcerted - what was Hawkeye doing in the loony bin?  The episode unraveled at a leisurely pace and every major character received a well-deserved shining moment leading up to the climax where we discover why Hawkeye cracked up.  The final thirty minutes lets us say our goodbyes to these beloved characters as they say farewell to each other.

The impact of this show on American culture cannot be overstated.

Amen.",1252627200,28,1763,4.73202614379085
3534765,5,B001DMVZNK,"It's a classic series with a long-lost, intelligent sense of humor not seen on TV these days. It was relevant then and still is now. It was a series with a social conscious. The DVD delivers quality better than I remember on the TV of old. Not much to say other than that. I'm still buying a season or so at a time until I collect them all.

I will say that Amazon's DVD packaging is horrible these days. When I first started buying the series over a year ago, it came in a box. Now it comes in a padded envelope! That's nuts! I have returned many, many DVDs lately because they come crushed, the inner plastic holders broken, and the DVDs scratched.

No matter what DVD you buy from them now, if it comes in an envelope - check it out immediately and return it if damaged. They pay the return postage and send you another one free of charge.",1251504000,6,842,4.191358024691358
