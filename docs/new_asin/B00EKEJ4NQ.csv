8606306,5,B00EKEJ4NQ,The show is entertaining.  The I didn't like was that I had to buy the disks for the other seasons of the Rowan years.  I also had to buy a DVD player that would play the disks because I live in region 1 and the disks were region 2.  I really hate that Acorn doesn't post all the seasons of shows they run.,1525392000,,306,3.8253968253968256

8606311,5,B00EKEJ4NQ,"A great British television series that escaped American views. Just be sure your DVD player is region free and can convert PAL format.
Hope the later episodes come out on disk.",1472342400,,176,4.709677419354839
8606312,5,B00EKEJ4NQ,"I have watched this series for years, first on Canadian television. We have been ordering it from Amazon UK. Great stories complete with English Bobbies and the local where everyone gathers for a drink and a laugh. Each episode includes pop songs from the 60's. I recommend this great series.",1462233600,,292,4.86
