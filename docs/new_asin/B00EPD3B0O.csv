8607870,5,B00EPD3B0O,"I thoroughly enjoyed this whole saga of 5 seasons...., spoken in the Queen's English........good stories, well acted. No sex, no real violence, no bad language, no computers, just very good stories reflecting Life and very good actors.",1401235200,5,235,5.378378378378378
8607871,5,B00EPD3B0O,"I was left with a feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop... The final episode left me with some unanswered questions, but then Thaw passed away and left us with wanting more of his presence.",1397779200,5,197,4.351351351351352
8607872,5,B00EPD3B0O,"This three-episode set contains the last episode in the series entitled ""The End of Law.""  It is a fitting end to the series and, without revealing the tag line at the end, it  once again demonstrates Kavanaugh's dedication to the principles behind the law, not just the current implementation which, as the viewer realizes, is very flawed.  The acting is superb and the story compelling even if it is a variation on a theme.

That said, I was disappointed in two respects:  (1) the packaging of the three episodes contains two that were already released in a prior packaging and so there is only the one episode which is new; and (2) there are no subtitles.

And that said, if you are a genuine John Thaw fan, then this is a must buy.",1387843200,6,735,4.488721804511278
