In a world where more and more of our land is being consumed by development, or affected by our climate, he effectively brings to the screen all of the subtle, yet complicated, grandeur that is our vanishing wetlands. This is a video for all to enjoy, young or old, and should be on the shortlist for any who want to enjoy and understand this unspoiled splendor, before it disappears.",1370304000,,516,4.7444444444444445

I currently live in Phoenix, AZ where I have lived for the last thirty two years but I do get back to L.A. regularly. After seeing this wonderful, well presented documentary I will be sure to visit the Gardena Willows Wetland Preserve on my next trip and take in it's rich history. Thank you. Douglas B.
