1658161,1,B00005RZK9,This is a horrible DVD!  Not worth the money.  It's bad...I mean BAD!  And not in a good way!  I don't believe Cathe the psychic one bit.  And some of the affects are obvious fakes.  You'd be better off purchasing a brick and watching that...it would be more entertaining!!!,1173225600,,274,4.489795918367347
1658162,1,B00005RZK9,"I bought the DVD as a fan of Supernatural Documentaries.  Some of the stories from the Inn Owners were interesting, but the DVD was ruined by the psychic Cathe who is so incredibly unbelievable it was painful!  Cathe... some advice, usually there is a point when contacting the dead; I've seen better psychics at the carnival.  Watching Cathe make small talk with empty space is really boring, and then finally, of the so called most incredible ghost video ever was so obviously faked by placing glass in front of the camera that it just is insulting.",1159315200,7,551,4.71875
1658163,4,B00005RZK9,"All in all,I found this DVD enjoyable and would recommend it to others fascinated in the supernatural. Probably not for the die-hard experienced investigator or super skeptical fact-seeker. Approaches more from the metaphysical standpoint,but does have a few interesting anomolies interspersed here and there that I found to be captivating. Hopefully the medium Cathe Curtis comes out with future projects-I enjoy the calm way in which she approaches the subject.",1142294400,3,463,5.628571428571429
1658164,3,B00005RZK9,"I would rate ""Real Ghost Stories"" higher than ""America's Most Haunted Inns"" However I did enjoy for the most part watching the DVD. In all honesty it's getting harder and harder to find good documentaries on the paranormal. God in heaven knows I have spent a fortune on VHS and DVDs about the paranormal. I do know for a fact that Ghost do exist for I have seen Ghost with my own eyes. Maybe one day science will be able to prove beyond any doubt that Ghost do exist. Damn near everyone loves a good Ghost story. America's Most Haunted Inns is not the worst or best I have seen on the paranormal at any rate I give it a 3 out of a possible 5 rating.

1658165,5,B00005RZK9,"I watched this film, and found it VERY educational, Informative, and sensative to the Spirit world. Most of the other ""ghost videos"" I've seen, seemed like they're trying to scare the pants off people. This one shows a compassion for them, and helping people to more understand them and to not be terrified of them.  I really enjoyed watching this video and Cathe makes you feel comfortable, not afraid, of the Spirit world. I thought it was very well put together,and I think everyone will enjoy seeing it.
  I loved the video footage also. I thought the pictures and video shots were Awesome. How often do you actually get to see Spirits on  camera....other than the re-enactment scenes you see on most of the other Haunted videos. Here, you get the REAL thing!!
  You will not be dissapointed if you buy this movie.. My whole family and friends thoroughly enjoyed it.. :0)",1012780800,7,875,4.723684210526316
1658166,5,B00005RZK9,"Explore the ''Other Side''
People looking for fearful accounts of chilling haunted tales and spine-tingling horror stories will be disappointed in America's Most Haunted Inns: Bucks County - because the story is not built around fear of the unknown - it explores a caring relationship with the spirits of those who have lived before.
The technical talent of Luminence Films combined with the special sensitive skills of Cathe Curtis introduces the viewer to real and documented interaction with the spirit world, and stresses that ''fear'' is the wrong approach in communicating with those who inhabit the etheral environment.
The video begins with a series of stories told by various inn operators and others, followed by Curtis taking the viewer on an actual paranormal investigation of the inns in question.
The production climaxes with actual video footage of spirits of Native Americans on horseback behind one of the old Colonial inns.
If you want fear, you have come to the wrong place. If you want to begin to understand the world of spirits, then this video is for you.

7952963,1,B00005RZK9,"No, I did not buy this from Amazon, but I did buy it for my mom.  She and I watched it together and both of us agree, it was REALLY awful.  The evidence they presented was truly UN-believable.  The so called psychic - I use that term reluctantly - treated the spirits, if there were actually any there as if they had an IQ of an idiot.  One of the Inn keepers said that Cathe treated the ghosts with respect, but to me respecting them would involve treating an adult like an adult, not like a child.

If you believe that ""orbs"" are a indication of spirit activity then you will love it because that is about all that they show.  A few of the videos clearly look like dust moving in the air, but Cathe claims, and the guy with her claims, it is spirits moving.  It's so incredibly lame.  I really wish I had not bought this at all.  If it was possible to give this less than 1 star, I would.  I've seen ""B"" movies that were better than this trash.

The Inns themselves are beautiful and the settings are really nice, but that is not what this DVD is supposed to be about.  My mom is just going to get rid of this DVD.

7952964,1,B00005RZK9,"The Inns in this video may very well be haunted, but Cathe the ""psychic"" tragically ruins any reputable evidence these Inns may have collected prior to her ""investigations"". Every time they take a photo you can see her deliberately kicking up dust; touching the dirt floor, then smacking her hands together, telling spirits to ""sit down on the chair"" as she dusts off the [clean, padded] chair for them.

7952965,5,B00005RZK9,"There have been a number of what I feel are unfairly negative reviews of this DVD, and its sister DVD ""America's Most Haunted Towns- New Hope"". I felt I had to speak up for this really enjoyable DVD.
This review was on the paranormalnews.com website, and I couldn't agree more:
""One of the more interesting videos that have come along this year, America's Most Haunted Inns by Rob Child's Luminence Films, filmed in Bucks County Pennsylvania, details the investigations of a ""sensitive"" named Cathe Curtis and her silent photographer, Richard, as they explore a number of inns in a territory of the United States that is overflowing with pre-20th century history. Throughout the episode Curtis explores the county's homes while her photographer snaps digital photos of the spirits she meets. What is fascinating about the whole process is you get to watch her investigations happen, and in some instances, even see the orbs float across your television that her photographer is constantly snapping with his Sony.

""Look! There's a little boy in here. Can we take your image? Aren't you precious."" Curtis states at one point, excited about a new discovery. Curtis's photographer then snaps a digital photo of an orb in the very same area where Curtis is pointing. The back of the video casing states, ""Absolutely no computer generated or manipulated images have been used in this production,"" and the entire 59 minute production is chocked full of this type of activity from Curtis, making you feel that you are witnessing something that is definitely not the result of a mere production house's editing.

In some inns, Curtis is actually able to name some of the spirits she meets, and learns through the home owners stories that other guests have shared about encounters. Checkerboards that constantly set themselves up, strangers that appear only to children, maids that take on physical form and tidy up guest's rooms while they sleep in bed---In a various instances, you witness spirit orbs passing by the video lens, and if you have the patience, you can probably discover orbs of your own that the video crew did not notice, thus allowing for any number of repeated viewings.

Throughout the film, there is no voice-over intrusion telling you what to believe nor when to believe it. The entire film was created in a way that allows you, the watcher, to make up your own mind about what you are witnessing. By the time you finish, you will be opening up your family photograph albums, looking for floating orbs and unexplainable streaks of light.

The film gives justice to the field of ghost hunting--where other documentaries fail to bring to your television anything other than campfire ghost stories starring people telling you what they HAD seen, you, as the viewer, get to see it for yourself. And that is what anyone who is watching this type of documentary wants. Therefore, I have no choice but to place this film under Paranormalnews.com's ""Recommended Viewing"" list. Hats off to Rob Child and Luminence Films.""

You know, people, it's a bit unfair to pan someone's entire work just because you don't happen to like a personality within that work. Yes, the psychic Cathe is a little annoying. But when she points at a corner and then the digital flash reveals a large orb floating in the exact place she's talking to, well, that's truly remarkable. She does it again and again. This DVD is an amazing thing, and I enjoyed the heck out of it. And to suggest that the last sequence was rigged somehow with glass just doesn't pan out. I've watched that sequence again and again, and it remains completely unexplainable to me. There is obviously no glass-- just pure strangeness. That particular part alone was worth the price of the DVD.-- C. Lewis",1289606400,,3760,4.887147335423197
7952966,1,B00005RZK9,i have many paranormal/documentary dvd's and found this to be quite boring  I really disliked the medium  Cathy.  I found her quite annoying.  Have seen much better.  I disliked that they did not give a good history about each inn.  Felt a little left out in the cold about some of the facts they were talking about and felt they should have given more information.,1261785600,,365,4.538461538461538
7952967,1,B00005RZK9,"We borrowed this DVD from a friend (thank goodness didn't waste any of our own money on it).It's a COMPLETE and TOTAL JOKE!!! The psychic Cathe, is by far the worst part--talking to ""spirits"" as though they are all 3-year-olds and showing ""orbs"" which are not ""astounding"" they are DUST! She is so ridiculous, you will LAUGH!! So, if you do enjoy and good cheesey laugh, this dvd might be for you. If you're looking for an AUTHENTIC paranormal documentary--save your time & money! This is the WORST!",1220140800,,499,4.681818181818182
