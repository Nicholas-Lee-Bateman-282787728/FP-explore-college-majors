Jednakze po przeczytaniu (bardzo urozmaiconego) artystycznego zyciorysu Lecha Majewskiego, postanowilem obejrzes jego film z 2007 roku 'Glass Lips' (Director: Lech Majewski Cast: Patryk Czajka, Joanna Litwin,Grzegorz Przybyl, Misia Rutkowska). Majewski napisal tez (razem ze Skrzekiem) muzyke, oraz byl odpowiedzialny za dzwiek.
Temat filmu przedstawiony jest w trzech opowiesciach, czesciowo od siebie zaleznych, i dotyczy odciskow dziecinstwa oraz relacji pomiedzy dziecmi i rodzicami.  Film, w ktorym kazda scena rozpoczyna sie duza dawka bolu, przestal mnie interesowac po pierwszych 30 minutach. Kolejne sceny powielaja tylko ten sam problem, niczym poobiednia czkawka. Nawet obfitosc mesko-damskiej golizny nie byla w stanie przytrzymac moich opadajacych powiek.
Oprocz dzwieku, swietnie podkreslajacego sceny wizualne, na pochwale zasluguje tez gra bohaterow filmu, ktorych bezslowna komunikacja pozwala nam odczuc cala game ich emocji. W skrocie, jest to film arystyczny ktory do znudzenia powiela swoj temat, calkiem niczym 'Campbell Soup' Warhola.",1222473600,2,1140,6.5
3445517,4,B001A33YUO,"Wordless, yet artful `Glass Lips' is sure to please the art crowd with exquisite camera shots and its symbolic thrust.  Not as evocative as '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syndromes-and-a-Century/dp/B000YIGNBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syndromes and a Century</a>,' but easily more accessible, the movie mulls over the process and fallout of one father's abuse.  While the series of short films don't entirely tell a linear story, the threads are meticulously woven to give a composite picture and a concrete ending.

Written, directed, shot, and produced by Lech Majewski, this Polish film mostly ponders the relationship between Sebastian (Patryk Czajka) and his abusive father (Grzegory Pryybyl).  Instead of showing scenes of beating, yelling, and mental abuse, the damage is mostly implied antecedently.

In an early scene a young Sebastian knocks over a beverage glass during dinner, prompting his father to restrain his son with a dog collar and leash as he eats his meal doggy style out of a dish placed on the floor.  In later scenes the boy engages in bizarre behavior, but as we see him as an adult, he's confined to a sanitarium shown in several scenes.  In contrast his father is free with a calloused, carefree attitude toward women in a way that suggests they're interchangeable for him.  Many of the vignettes, illustrate Sebastian's repressed sexuality as he's shown in confinement and in frozen meat lockers.

Among the most tangible elements is its religious imagery.  Making easy references to ""Abraham and Isaac"" as well as Jesus's Passion, his inner anguish is given a visible context.

One of my favorite moments is when he's at the mental hospital while looking at a picture of a mountain.  After he tears the photo in two, he starts rubbing the sides together, creating an avalanche that you can hear as sediment pours down on his head.

Abstract, yet rewarding, `Glass Lips' doesn't try to pull the wool over our eyes.  If you're inclined to the art house cinema, you won't want to miss this mural exhibit that does indeed paint a delicate story with expert skill.

8275874,2,B001A33YUO,"Can't say I liked Glass Lips, but in it I caught glimpses of how I might very well enjoy other works by this filmmaker.

IMDB notes this was ""originally presented as 33 short films, is an experimental, bizarre set of meditations and flashbacks of the grotesque.""  That pretty much sums it up.  Striking imagery, gratuitous surrealism, scenes that could be anywhere from disgusting to erotic to sublime to ridiculous - or a combination of all of the above.  Bizarre dreamscapes or possibly memories. No dialogue at all, which actually was a good fit. It was certainly a very odd film.",1364774400,,583,4.8
8275875,4,B001A33YUO,"Lech Majewski's Glass Lips (2007) debuted as an instillation piece at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It's original title was Blood of a Poet, paying homage to Jean Cocteau's 1930 film. Surreal, kaleidoscopic, and predominantly silent, Glass Lips feels like a series of interrelated shorts literally forming a ""motion picture.""

Sebastien (Patrick Czajka) is the poet in question in this painterly film, which begins with his birth atop a towering rock. The sound of the infant wailing, his umbilical cord dangling, is the only one we hear from his lips. This image later connects to a waterlogged dream of his mother (Joanna Litwin) giving birth to a bloodied rock.

Maternal inertia is the dominant pigment used in painting Sebastien as the scourged poet. One striking image calls to mind early photographs of artist Andres Serrano (when Serrano actually counted). The sensual, nude mother, clothed only in pathos, glides by row after row of slaughtered hogs. The Serrano image, so striking and, for some reason, long unavailable, showed the image of Christ (a young, blonde woman, dressed in a short, black nightclub dress) before the swine (the hog's bloodied torso hanging from a hook in the ceiling). Paradoxically, iconoclastic and liturgical metaphors repetitively intertwine in Majewski's parochial bedlam.

The suffering mother is forced to witness her only son's humiliation by a severe, unyielding father (Grzegorz Przybyl). The mother seeks to both nurture and be nurtured. She is not milked and can no longer can provide milk. Therefore, she baptizes her naked body, as Sebastien witnesses. For the father, mother is not fully human. She is merely a hole for his convenience. She is, at first, replaced by a blow-up doll.

Eventually, the death of his wife resonates and the father peels away layer after layer, to discover his own folly. But, neither is Sebastien guiltless. His romanticized nihilism might be something akin to dysfunctional stained glass windows that simultaneously mythologize, canonize and eroticize his projected experiences.

Alpo as the Eucharist; erotic playtime between Ma and Pa as Sebastien, bound and adorned in first communion dress, stands in for the host in this poetic reenactment of transubstantiation.

The homoerotic frescoes of St. Sebastien are re-imaged with a Marian sheen. Mother repeatedly replaces son in martyrdom. Rows of the maternal tree, reduced to an orifice by exploring patriarchal hands.

There is also resurrection. Nothing is permanent, possible because the martyr also co-created his passion, painted his pathos, and unraveled the rope which ties him to the cliches and traditions of the doomed poet.

Majewski himself composed the impressive score, creating  a lush language to supplant impotent words. Glass Lips not only inspires the viewer to labor in his or her voyeurism, but the film also demands some sweat from those who write about it.
