8448427,5,B004YJZC3S,This is a fabulous way to do a total body conditioning program. Each exercise is well thought out to assure you cover all the important muscles. You can control the intensity of the workout and you can repeat parts of it because it can be broken up into separate chapters. I go to her class religiously and have found this to be an excellent way to keep up my routine on vacation or if I cannot make it to the gym. Also a great gift for family and friends. Love it!,1321228800,,465,4.1208791208791204
8448428,5,B004YJZC3S,"Molly is renowned for her ability to serve up a creative, effective workout with clear direction and natural positive vibe.  This workout is no exception and is a ""carry out"" version of the class she's made famous in the greater San Francisco area.  That she's rockin' a strong, skinnyjeans body is an inspiration for all of us over 40.  You'll get a few familiar shapes tossed in with precise and fun new movements, and the overall sequencing will access every part of your body.  This video is topping my list for friends/students who ask me ""I dont' have a whole lot of time and with other life responsibilities can't make it to the gym, whats a good video to do?""",1309651200,4,667,4.533333333333333
8448429,5,B004YJZC3S,"The Skinny Jeans workout is a full body routine that will strengthen and transform your body immediately.  The key element of this workout is form.  Molly provides specific yet easy to follow instructions about how to get the most out of each exercise.  The result is a workout that quickly makes you feel taller, leaner and uber strong.  This is truly awesome stuff!  Love it!",1307145600,5,377,4.7384615384615385
