3663940,4,B001K98MKU,"Gundam Seed Destiny, though received much harsh criticism from fans and reviewers alike isn't bad by any means. If you've watched the series from the beginning of Seed your in bound for more of everything good and bad the series has offered and delivered. The continued assaults between Zaft and the Earth forces will reach a satisfying conclusion but the story won't end there. New mobile suits arrive and change the course of the war. Kira and the Archangel crew will finally take the top stage as the line between right and wrong blur, heroes take the side of the wrong and enemies from before become welcome allies for the end. I won't spoil the story with detailed explanations though I do give a firm warning that the last episode has somewhat of a let down ending, just as it doesn't give a lot of closure. The movie  Gundam Seed Destiny Final Plus is basically an extended version of the last episode with more action and story and is a much more satisfying ending. Overall if you've enjoyed the characters, gundams, battles, and triumphs that Seed has given you so far, you'll love this box set. If you've felt you've been dragged along for a boring ride that doesn't suit your tastes, perhaps the 4 Destiny movies would be better as they give the story without all the extra development and filler. Either way Seed Destiny is definately a true Gundam thrill.",1238630400,4,1368,4.652892561983471
3663941,1,B001K98MKU,"Gundam Seed Destiny is a 50 episode anime following the prequel, Gundam Seed.

For the first 34 episodes, it maintains the same level of quality of its predecessor.  The remaining 16 episodes turns the series on its head, turning this sequel series into something along the lines of Ace Ventura Jr. or Son of the Mask, only less Jim Carrey's spawn and more a hostile takeover of the plot by characters with less personality than a cardboard cutout, with robots so overpowered they never get damaged.  The OTHER side of the war has the newly designated bad guys characterization going downhill as well.  For example, one character makes a large point in his character, only to suddenly change the next episode and contradict himself, turning into a villain for no reason.  In the show, this decision likely took only five minutes.

This is where the show's horror truly shows.  If you're a large SEED fan and have already bought the first Destiny set, watch up to episode 34 and quit the series while you're ahead. If you haven't watched the series yet, stay away.  Those last episodes are horrible enough to plunge both this and its prequel into a sea of desolation.",1238371200,7,1166,4.737623762376238

i cant really recommend this series because it sucks.

go buy G Gundam or stardust memory instead.

oh btw the packaging sucks. 5 discs inside a single dvd case??? i hate having to take out a disc to get to a disc...no thanks",1362096000,,483,4.117021276595745

3663944,5,B001K98MKU,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance.

Anyway, Gundam SEED Destiny is truly a wonderful anime that from the moment you begin watching, you really start to think about why things like this are happening, you are able to compare many things from this anime into our lives and see how our world is not much diffrent. I could spend days detailing why this is anime is so great but I'm simply going sum it up by saying it was truly in my opinion, Epic and a Must-See.",1332115200,,614,4.125
3663948,4,B001K98MKU,"(**CONTAINS SPOILERS**)

I really enjoy SEED Destiny, which is not actually half as bad as what other ppl said it would be.  I think the reason ppl reject this sequel mainly because they have a different expectation toward the series prior to viewing it.  I was fortunate enough to read many negative reviews, gathered all sort of opinions before actually watching it.  All their warnings and negative concerns on the series helped me prepare what to expect this series in an objective kind of way.  With low expectation, I found myself extremely surprised by how exciting and addictive SEED Destiny truly is.

I notice that some ppl criticized this series for being overly similar to its highly successful prequel SEED (2002).  Some even mocked it as parody or copycat.  After finished watching SEED Destiny myself, I found this criticism is a bit unfair and invalid.  There are actually VERY FEW similar incidents repeated between the two.  Of course there are minor similarities, but they are justified and can be explained with scenario. For example they say how this series copied SEED from the beginning where Gundams were stolen and then the protagonists went to pursue. In the original Gundam series (0079), it also began by Amuro Ray who drove off the Gundam without Earth Force's authorization. The same go for Zeta Gundam where Kamile was seen hijacking the Black Gundam without Titan's approval then followed by a pursuit. With all these similarities, it seems to me the same repeated feature is more of a tradition rather than a blatant intent to copy from one another. For instance how many Gundam main villains we found wearing a mask and took after Char Aznable's mannerism from the original Gundam series?  Too many.  Even if I am wrong, SEED Destiny definitely didn't copy from SEED as they say. Gundam series has been taking inspirations from one another since the very beginning, so let's not pretend SEED Destiny is the only guilty party here.

In addition, some ppl also have a problem with previous heroes like Kira, Lacus, Arthun etc. rejoined the cast and save the world yet again.  I would have agreed with them if it weren't because SEED Destiny is supposed to be a sequel rather than a new alternative universe in SEED series.  That means in order to continue where the previous series left off, Kira, Archangel and other former protagonists are justified for appearing in this sequel again.  However, in other perspective, I do understand why the ppl think Kira and others shouldn't have returned in this series.  This problem is largely caused by the creator who mistakenly tried to market an uncharismatic and super dumb antagonist - Shin Asuka as the new protagonist, which resulted in unnecessary confusion and wrong expectation for the viewers.  Throughout the course of the series, we are often misled who to focus on the series - is it Shin who represents the Plant, Arthun or Kira?  I think I agree with other ppl about this point because this is a huge inconsistency. Despite that, the returns of Kira, Arthun and the Archangel are written smoothly and justified with good reasons.

The show inherits all the good parts from the usual Gundam series we normally love:  the actions or gundam battles are fast-paced, intense and explosive; the plot has a lot of unexpected twists and at the same time it is complicated as well as a bit ambitious in the end (especially the part involving the Destiny plan, which I think should've been given a longer time to revolve); all the drama depicted seemed a bit tiresome, but generally well-written with clear transitional approach and explanations; characterization is not necessarily bad, it's good to see old characters like Kira and Arthun grow a bit in this series.  Kira has developed into a much more mature, insightful and determined as a Gundam pilot; he's no longer the whining reluctant hero we used to see; Arthun also keeps fighting what he believes in but never sold his souls to the wrong side and he appears more adaptable and less stubborn than he used to be.  Visually, it's on par with it s prequel SEED (2002), it doesn't seem the pictures had been remastered and it's not full-screen.  In music-wise, it's done very well. I especially enjoy the first ending song, I think it's called ""Reason"" or something, it's very catchy and upbeat. In my opinion, that's the best song for the entire SEED franchise.

Now let's talk about the bad parts.  There are basically two setbacks hindering the quality of the show.  One in particular is the characters.  As I said above, Shin Asuka was wrongfully made as the main protagonist while he fought for the wrong side the whole time.  I have no excuses for this character since he's extremely dumb, easily manipulated, downright annoying and awful as a jerk from head to toes. I won't spoil you with examples, but this character lacks redeeming quality to the point that almost ruined the whole show.  The other new characters also lack serious character developments and interest.  I got no more to say about them except they are all flat and boring.  The only new character I found interesting is the Chairman Gilbert Dullindal who is arguably one of the most intelligent and persuasive villains I've seen in Gundam series.  Although it's not that difficult to suspect the character has a hidden agenda behind his smiling face, surprisingly the character made a lot of sensible points I agree with; therefore, it's shame to see him fallen in the end.

Another major setback is the lackluster ending.  Normally in Gundam series, they at least assign 4 or 5 episodes to conclude the series, but in SEED Destiny, I was surprised they only used two to resolve all the conflicts and they also wasted an entire episode 48 dedicated to a dead supporting character before ending the series. The final conflicts seemed to happen too sudden and was ended abruptly without fully fledged out.  The battle between Minerva and Archangel lacked impact and interest; The Gundam fights from both sides also lacked explosion and intensity because the final battle is relatively short and hindered by the limited time.  I don't know what went through the creator's head at that point, but he seemed to rush to finish the series, which turned out to be a huge disappointment.  Although he tried to make up for it by recreating a new ending in Final Plus (which has a much better ending), but the revised battle has been made very little change itself, leave alone the quality has been improved in general.

Furthermore, it really irks me that they had to make Rey suddenly act out of his character to end the whole thing.  I won't spoil you with details, but I have to say Rey's sudden change of heart is the most unconvincing thing in the entire series.  In my opinion, Shin should've been a better choice to end it (since this way could help improve his negative image a bit in the end) or Kira or Arthun whatever, just anyone but Rey who proved to be the most loyal servant to Gilbert Dullidal.

All in all, SEED Destiny is very entertaining sequel despite of some weaknesses.  Although it's not as good as SEED (2002)in general, it still succeeds in delivering a great deal of exciting values that could only be seen on Gundam series.  Just remember not to dismiss the series based on the overwhelming negative reviews. You should read them, but don't jump to conclusions until you finish seeing it for yourself.",1328140800,10,7433,4.805184603299293
3663949,5,B001K98MKU,"I have been watching Gundam series since they first aired here in the U.S.  I really enjoyed the first Gundam Seed with immense excitement.  It reminded me of Gundam Wing a little bit with some of the character types which helped bring me in even more.  Destiny came out and I enjoyed it just as well.  Maybe I am not that critical.  I watched it and enjoyed it.  I like the characters and I was glad to see the ones from the first season come and take more prominent roles in the latter episodes.  There are some similarities between the first and second series of Gundam Seed, but once again . . . If you really enjoy Gundam, who really cares?  Listen, if you enjoy the Gundam universe and its stories, pick this up.  You will enjoy it and have a fun watch.",1306108800,,759,4.251748251748252
3663950,1,B001K98MKU,"Gundam Seed Desinty was the followup sequel to the hit series Gundam Seed.  Let's be clear, I grew up with the original UC Gundam series from the 80s and 90s.  I liked Seed very much for taking the theme of the original MSG series and giving it a nice refresh for the post 2000 anime viewing crowd.  Great designs and animation and aside from some quirks like director Fukuda's overuse of the flashback as a cheap storytelling device, very solid show and cool MS designs, fast action.

So what did Gundam Seed Desinty do?  Take everything good about Seed...reuse them...and make it slightly worse.

Seed starts off with a protoype Gundam hijack.  GSD starts off with...a prototype Gundam hijack.  Ok

Seed focused on the Earth Alliance ship and characters as the protagnoists.  GSD flips this around with an all ZAFT crew as the protagonists, ok that's an interesting twist.

GSD does some interesting character developments with the main character Shinn Asuka but then things start to go horribly wrong after the midpoint of the series.

Somewhere the show writers lose direction or perhaps creative control of the plot, and somehow, the main characters of Destiny end up getting shoved into the background as secondary characters, the old cast of the Archangel, Kira and Athrun end up becoming the show leads once again.  And the main character Shinn turns into an unlikeable loser nemesis to Kira?  Maybe the writers were trying to do something clever with the plot, but this mess is what ends up transpiring.

And the end, pathetic.  No wonder Destiny did not get any airtime on US TV unlike Seed which was quite popular.

If you've watched Seed and enjoyed it, please just skip Destiny, pretend the show just didn't exist, otherwise you'll get caught up in the promising start then get dissapointed as the show progresses and then really get upset at yourself at having invest so much viewing time just to reach that miserable conclusion.",1305590400,5,1943,4.857142857142857

8314472,4,B001K98MKU,"Gundam Seed was a nice addition to the Gundam franchise, and Gundam Seed Destiny builds on to it like Gundam Zeta did with the first Gundam Series.  Many comparisons can be made as well. With Mobile Suit Gundam, you followed primarily the side of the Federation and your ""Bad Guys"" were Zeon.  With Zeta you followed the AEUG and more so watched the Titans (the Federation to an extent) and Zeon while facing confrontations.  In Seed you followed the Earth Alliance and the ""Bad Guys"" were ZAFT.  With Seed Destiny you followed Kira and the Archangel while watching the Earth Alliance and ZAFT while facing confrontations.

The second part of the series is a favorite of mine.  You get the experience twist that make you wonder who the real evil is? Is it Blue Cosmos, the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, or the people behind the scenes? What drives war? Is it human nature, or is it the will of a few who influence others.  It also shows that war is not black and white.

A con to the series would be the animation.  The series came out in the early years of digital animation, where the animation shortcuts of hand drawn series did not transfer well to the digital animation. Oh... and lets not forget the BEYOND ANNOYINGLY whiny Shin.  My 4 year old son doesnt whine as much as he does.",1408838400,,1279,4.4978354978354975

8314478,1,B001K98MKU,"List of complaints:

unlike most every other Gundam series w/ a main ship, the bridge on it has no memorable characters (aside from the guy with the horrible British accent that is completely annoying)

The character who is supposed to be the lead protagonist (Shinn) is transformed into a minor antagonist.  He does not grow at all in character (as in personal attributes)

The political aspect drains up too much time in too many episodes and it is never interesting to begin with.

Unmemorable climax as opposed to seed (I assume you watched it) which is absolutely berserk effectively using the typical ""Kill 'em all"" finale style of the franchise.  There were characters I didn't want to die but they sacrificed them which is good in order to show that no individual knows when their time is up.

Finally, I was always in anticipation that something exciting would occur, especially in sub-plots, that would provide great entertainment.  Destiny doesn't have that like Seed.  There is no Desert Tiger chronicle (awesome portion that is great in growing Kira mentally in his opinions and convictions), the arrival of the three pseudo-Coordinaters that prove great antagonists, Dearka's time as a prisoner on Archangel, etc.

I watched seed long ago and remember these clearly.  I can hardly remember anything of consequence from Destiny.
