5276811,4,B00979KQJA,This remake of Son of Fury is a terrific adventure. The cast is good (although Anne Bancroft is no match for the original's Frances Farmer) and the color is vivid. Well worth seeing. It's also perfect for youngsters.,1354406400,7,216,4.7105263157894735
5276812,3,B00979KQJA,"I remembered having watched this movies when I was a kid,
not all of it, just some parts, especially the scenes filmed
in Guatemala, which are beautiful.  It didn't disappoint me,
although it's not Delmer Daves best movie.  Cornel Wilde was
solid and it was fun to watch a very young Anne Bancroft playing
a villain (which I didn't recall). Acceptable video quality.",1352505600,7,366,4.7936507936507935

5276815,5,B00979KQJA,This is the same exact movie as son of fury with tyrone power. They both are equally fantastic. I enjoyed watching it and will enjoy it again!!!!!!!!,1412985600,,149,4.555555555555555

5276817,5,B00979KQJA,"This an old classic featuring Cornel Wilde with fantastic scenery of Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, Central America.
An old movie with plenty of plot and well written as was a norm once upon a time in Hollywood.
The DVD was delivered on time and well packaged; this seller provides a good hard to find product
and very good customer service/satisfaction.

5276819,4,B00979KQJA,"I have always enjoyed movies starring Cornel Wilde.  This movie closely parallels ""The Son of Fury"" that starred Tyrone Power. Other than the place where the wronged star spent his time in exile, it is essentially the same.  I still enjoyed seeing this movie.  The colors were very good and the movie copy was clear.",1402876800,2,316,4.709090909090909
5276820,4,B00979KQJA,Ordered it because a relative had a small part in it. Was pleasantly surprised...it was a pretty good old movie,1387152000,,111,4.6
5276821,5,B00979KQJA,"This movie was a childhood memory and has been on my ""look for"" list for decades. While a remake of a Tyrone Power film (Son of Fury?), it still stood on its own. With Finlay Curry (Ivanhoe, People Will Talk) in a supporting role, it was a pleasure to see again!",1386633600,2,262,4.1568627450980395
5276822,5,B00979KQJA,This enjoyable remake of an earlier Tyrone Power movie based on an Edison Marshall novel is worth watching more than once.,1361059200,,122,4.857142857142857

8537374,5,B00979KQJA,"Ordered book it was based on. Stayed up late last night to watch this,and it was excellent. Young boy supposedly adopted by his greedy uncle,sent to work in stables,meets and falls for ""uncle's"" daughter. Highly recommend this rendition,never watched Son Of Fury,but may since Gene Tierney is in it.",1473206400,,299,5.122448979591836
8537375,5,B00979KQJA,Great old adventure film with the late Cornel Wilde.  They don't make movies like this anymore where the actors can actually act.,1452902400,,129,4.863636363636363
8537376,4,B00979KQJA,"Good color, nice transfer, and shot on location in Guatemala.",1450396800,,61,5.2
8537377,4,B00979KQJA,"This is one of those movies that I saw in a theater many years ago and enjoyed it immensely. I like Cornel Wilde as an actor and have seen many of his films. This is one of his best. It also includes a young Anne Bancroft, which is a bonus. I have been looking for a copy over the years but have not found it from any source till now. The movie was not shot in widescreen format, which is regrettable. The scenery and vistas in the movie call for widescreen treatment. I have read the novel ""Benjamin Blake"" on which this movie was based. I have also seen ""Son of Fury,"" the original film based on the book. This remake of ""Son of Fury"" holds its own in comparison. I dock it one star for the standard screen format.",1435017600,,716,4.121428571428571
8537378,5,B00979KQJA,"I travel to Guatemala yearly on mission trips, one of my friends saw this movie and recommended it to me. I know it is old, but it was a GREAT movie!",1428451200,,149,3.838709677419355
8537379,5,B00979KQJA,"My husband caught this on television, only the last half.  Then I got an E-mail from your website.  We purchased the film because of the stars
in it.  Cornel Wilde especially.  Very exciting and full  of action.  It resembles an old Fox movie called Son of Fury with Tyrone Power. Good film.",1426032000,,291,4.5
