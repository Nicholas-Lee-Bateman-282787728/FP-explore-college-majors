6094912,5,B00GOC756A,"I would recommend this Movie set due to the fact all the movies are great if you love British Cinema the way I do.
You can not go wrong with this one.",1401580800,9,150,3.71875
6094913,5,B00GOC756A,"I was so happy to find these jewels in one box.  Even though I've seen three of them, they are stories you dwell on long after you've seen them.  Most are not huge  box-office smashes so you don't expect to find DVDs of them anywhere; however, when you do you grab them and the price was surprisingly reasonable.",1400025600,17,312,4.344827586206897
6094914,5,B00GOC756A,"I love all of the films in this collection. In fact I almost did not buy this set, because I already owned three of the films in it.  However, after researching the remaining three, I found that the cost(after tax and shipping) was way more than the price for this item. Plus, the individual DVD's didn't really have any extras to note. So you don't miss out on much.",1398211200,10,367,4.318840579710145

6094918,1,B00GOC756A,Would not have purchased this if I had realized 5 of 6 of the films were R rated for sexuality and/or language.  The only PG13 film was rather strange in other ways.,1471737600,2,165,4.15625

6094927,5,B00GOC756A,I love the British comedies.  They certainly do it right.  Driving lessons is so funny and touching.  It is one of my favorites.  I bought this collection to receive it.,1442534400,,169,4.533333333333333

6094934,3,B00GOC756A,I probably know better than to get multiple movie sets...But this was ok. Some of the movies I didn't care for and would have never purchased.,1432512000,,142,4.5

6094939,4,B00GOC756A,"British cinema is uniquely entertaining, so even if a movie in this selection isn't doing it for you, the acting and scenery might hold your attention for one viewing!",1421366400,,167,4.793103448275862
6094940,2,B00GOC756A,"My taste in British cinema apparently has changed.  Used to like most of the shows.

This collection did not suit me at all.  Gave it to friend who will watch almost anything to entertain himself.",1420416000,,196,4.542857142857143
6094941,4,B00GOC756A,"These films were very entertaining British indies.  For the price, they are well worth it if that's your thing.",1414368000,2,111,4.842105263157895

6094944,3,B00GOC756A,"I watched them all, and while they were well done none of them made my ""must see"" list. It was interesting to see many good British actors but I have to say, all in all, the plot lines were rather plodding. I found myself disappointed with all of them.",1406764800,,252,4.163265306122449

8625420,4,B00GOC756A,"I'm giving this one four stars instead of three because my disappointments are based on personal taste - there's nothing technically wrong with the DVD or the productions. I love BBC period pieces and old British movies, but these aren't anything like that - these are basically small, art house films, which have always been a 50/50 dice roll for me (I usually loved half, and disliked half, of art house films). I did like the performances in Driving Lessons, which I think alone was worth the price of the DVD.",1495065600,,513,4.648351648351649

8625423,5,B00GOC756A,"This is a wonderful and wide ranging collection of fine British films.  Las Orders is a real standout.  Old friends gather to honor the passing of one of the group.  They are an oddly assorted group of friends, and as the story progresses, much is revealed about the past that both binds and separates them.  I am working my way through the films slowly and enjoying every one so far.  Every one is well worth viewing more than once.",1480896000,,433,4.430379746835443
