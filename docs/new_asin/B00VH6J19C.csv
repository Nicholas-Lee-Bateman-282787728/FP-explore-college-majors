8710120,5,B00VH6J19C,I especially like the director's cut of this film which is included with the DVD. Touching heartfelt honest performances. I enjoyed this film and especially appreciated that it is family friendly.,1509148800,,196,5.354838709677419
8710121,5,B00VH6J19C,"I saw this movie when it opened! I love it and everyone should see it. Most church movies skip the hard parts of being wayward and what it really takes to get back on track of following Christ. Buy it, watch it and you'll feel edified for sure.",1491177600,,244,4.104166666666667

8710124,2,B00VH6J19C,"It had a spiritual ending but the part to show how he fell away and how he lost his inheritance was very unspiritual and way to graphic for a faith based movie. I actually fast forwarded through the most of the scenes of taking drugs, drinking and partying, especially the scenes of violence and threats of murder with guns. Wasn't very happy with it. I only really liked the last maybe 15 minutes. Would not recomend this to anyone.",1461628800,,433,4.493670886075949
