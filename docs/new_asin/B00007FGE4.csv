1808337,5,B00007FGE4,"I agree, this is a very good DVD to learn from, its like you are in a class not just watching somebody who already knows it. Not everybody wants a video with some tv model and newage music, some people want to learn the moves and this is really good that way. Of course its slow paced, thats what tai chi is about, gentle motion and stress relief, what kind of nitwit cant take 20 minutes to learn it the right way. This retired Marine votes its a good deal.",1131753600,31,458,4.1
1808338,1,B00007FGE4,"The quality of the DVD is OK, however the method in which she presents herself, in my opinion, is terrible. Her voice is monotone and it takes her 25 minutes just to begin the first movement. For beginners I strongly suggest finding another DVD",1114819200,7,244,4.568181818181818
1808339,5,B00007FGE4,"Unlike every other video I've seen this one shows you the way a class does, from the back, with repetition and at a beginners pace. I've been in the martial arts for 20 years now and have been recommending this since it was on vhs. For whatever reason all the others simply stand in front of a camera and do the moves. NOBODY learns that way, not even professional dancers. I check videos frequently to look at teaching and have seen plenty of students blow cash on the ""look at me"" type that does NOT work for new learners. What is quirky about it is that the leotard babe on the cover is nowhere to be found - the presenter is a gray-haired little old lady and some people quibble about that too. Well get over it guys, she knows how to teach ! Whats more important is that you beginners won't get frustrated. This is also a two disk set that covers the entire yang long form and quite a bargain. So if you're looking for buff pretty people on the beach go elsewhere, if you want to actually learn this will do it. Professional quality production (made by the nfl films guys) and the dvd format is essential (you will be stopping and repeating).  She even imparts the only real secret of the martial arts - ""have patience"". This is the one I buy to give to family - cant make a stronger case than that.",1108252800,136,1304,4.258064516129032
7975686,5,B00007FGE4,"Received as promised. The packaging and DVD's were in very good condition. Very good price for this product. If you are interested in Tai Chi, then you might want to find a copy of this DVD. Clair Hooten breaks the Yang Short From down into manageable segments. She talks you through each move while demonstrating it as well. Then, you watch her face on and two other students from your viewers perspective. The camera stays in one place so the viewer's orientation doesn't change!!! That's a good thing.",1494892800,,504,4.738636363636363

7975688,5,B00007FGE4,"I have four different instruction DVDs for the short yang style Tai Chi form as originally taught by Cheng Man-Ch'ing and this is the best of the lot. Claire Hooten takes you through the positions at a pace that is easy to follow and even when she is reviewing the entire form she continues to work at a pace that allows one to keep up and her reverse view is a God send for those amongst us that get our left and right confused. Unlike the other videos that I have, Claire also takes time at the beginning to explain posture, breathing and some of the philosophy behind this very old martial art form.

For those that are interested in finding a second good version to use for further clarification of this particular style of Tai Chi I recommend the DVD by Master Cheng Man-Ch'ing's grand daughter, Tiffany Chen. She does the moves a little faster and her flipped video is not as helpful (to me) as the reverse view of Claire's video but it is still an excellent source for furthering your Tai Chi practice.",1360713600,,1009,4.424731182795699
7975689,5,B00007FGE4,"I took lessons for 3 years on the Long Yang Form.  Over the years I didn't practice and needed review.  Classes I signed up form were disappointing, DVD's worthless as they showed the frontal view which is worthless when trying to learn Tai Chi or anything else.  Excellent instructor, great pace of instruction.  Best DVD available for those who seriously want to learn Tai Chi.",1246924800,,379,4.7846153846153845
7975690,5,B00007FGE4,"My problem needs gentle excercise and I was introduced to Tai Chi many years ago. Out of the dozen or so instructors I tried, Claire Hooten's tapes were easily the most awarding at teaching this older, clueless, then beginner. Her manner, voice, teaching style are simple the B-E-S-T! I'm so glad she is still available, and on DVD's because I still prefer working with her. But I must also add, having that young chick on the cover, does seem purposely misleading for those who don't know the person teaching.",1236211200,,510,4.741573033707865
7975691,1,B00007FGE4,Impossible to follow instructions.  She moves too fast through the lesson and i found it impossible to follow her hand movements and foot positions,1233792000,2,147,5.125
7975692,5,B00007FGE4,"As has been mentioned in the past, the blonde on the cover is not in any part of the actual video - thankfully.  Instead, we get Claire Hooten, a silver-haired older woman with an easy manner and clear instruction style who's rather a relief from other fitness video instructors.

The instruction portion itself is done well, with clear analogies and explanation.  It's paced well, neither too fast - so you can easily keep up - nor too slow - so you stay engaged and not bored as you wait for the next move.  Each DVD chapter is broken down into three movements, with demonstration at the beginning and practice at the end, which makes it very easy to go back and review particular movements.  The demonstration is presented with the instructor facing the camera, while the practice has the instructor facing the camera but two assistants facing away, so you can watch either way.  At the end of the first disc is a separate chapter with all three in reverse view, so that you can practice the featured portion of the sequence without the chapter interruptions.  The first disc presents the first 20 moves, while the second completes the short form with the last 40.

The only complaint that I really have is that the second disc does not also feature a full run-through to practice to.

Overall, this is the favorite fitness video in my collection and the best instructional taiji video I've found.  It's certainly well-worth the effort to track down a copy!",1223769600,3,1460,4.690196078431373
7975693,1,B00007FGE4,"What an obvious, stupid marketing ploy - putting a toned young girl on the cover, while the instructor is an older gray-haired lady. Guess they figured they wouldn't sell many with HER photo on the front.
After she gets thru the initial introductory blah, blah, blah, and finally starts instructing, she moves very quickly, and doesn't stop to repeat. Having her two assistants from the rear-view was very helpful, but when they weren't on the screen, I got hopelessly lost trying to coordinate arms, wrists, hands, knees, legs, feet, etc. all at once.",1217376000,2,552,4.946236559139785

7975695,5,B00007FGE4,"I couldn't learn from the half-dozen other DVDs I bought to practice Tai Chi with because the instructors were facing me, using the opposite hand and foot, which just confused me hopelessly. This one not only takes things one step at a time, but also has a rear view so you can follow along with the same foot and hand. It has the complete form at the end so once you learn it, you can just practice the form (with the rear view) and then go directly to any problem areas you encounter as needed. I love this DVD & got a copy for my mother-in-law and have recommended it to everyone I know who's interested in Tai Chi.",1171584000,20,618,4.201680672268908
