7759407,5,B01GE8HQQM,"Fantastic fictional account of Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb.  Very informative and entertaining.  It was good to see Sam  Neill in his normal accent- his acting improves greatly it seems.  I loved seeing the beautiful objects from the tomb and what appears to be some of the actual footage from Carter's entry into the tomb.  I felt the movie makers did an excellent job of making the film location look like Egypt even though they filmed in South Africa.  Loved the relationship between Carter and Lord Carnarvon- very poignant.  Max Irons was wonderful all around.  I love period pieces in general because you learn about a particular time and place in history- but this film gave the added bonus of giving us an insight into one of the most incredible discoveries in human experience.  I highly recommend.  No sex scenes, family friendly.",1515456000,2,860,4.951048951048951
7759408,2,B01GE8HQQM,"long....not completely boring...but ends badly...love-story-wise...total FAIL in fact...i wish i never watched it....quite honestly the ending made me feel kind of nauseous for about 12 hours and made me yell repeatedly at my TV ""WHAT? WHY? STUPID ENDING!!""...the acting was really quite good...it's the writing that failed miserably...i mean really..take a little creative license being as you did so much of that already and give us a happy ending you silly writers....life is filled with sad endings...we don't watch movies to be reminded of that...obviously.",1514678400,,562,5.623529411764705
7759409,4,B01GE8HQQM,Very good documentary story about the find of the century.  Excellent acting and the thrill of the adventure captured in this 4 part BBC story.  Definitely worth watching.,1513468800,6,171,5.071428571428571
7759410,5,B01GE8HQQM,"I absolutely loved this mini-series. All the acting was brilliant. It followed the lives of archaeologist Howard Carter, his benefactor Lord Carnarvon, Carnarvon's daughter (the first woman to enter the tomb of King Tut, Carter's competitor & eventual friend (Herbert Winlock), a woman archaeologist (Maggie Lewis) and many others.
The setting is gorgeous. The excavations are believable. The anticipation & excitement as first the steps are found (by an Arab boy) & then the chamber, still sealed.
I well remember reading about all this when I was 10 years old. To this day, archaeology excites me. My husband & I have done expoloring (not excavating, though) at many neolithic sites all over Europe. It was fascinating to follow this story of the most amazing archaeological find in history.",1513296000,,793,5.203125

7759418,5,B01GE8HQQM,Jeremy Iron's son is a knockout in every department. Good acting and period art direction. The film takes its time and its artistry and cinematography make it worth its time.,1506729600,2,174,4.833333333333333

7759420,4,B01GE8HQQM,"The movie met my expectations. I thought that the acting was good and believable and for the most part, the story line stuck to history. Although I don't know that Howard Carter , in real life, was quite such a lady's man and spent as much time bed-hopping as the movie implied.

But the sets were very realistic and the scenes looked historically accurate and it was interesting to see how the Egyptian authorities reneged on their original agreements and made it just about worthless and unprofitable for archaeologists  to continue digging at their own personal expense, with no benefits to themselves in the end, since all antiquities were claimed by the Egyptian government.

As Carter accurately summed it up: the Egyptian government made no effort in 3,000 years to locate Tut's tomb, but now, once found at the expense of the British, they wanted to claim all of its contents.",1505606400,3,884,4.841059602649007

7759423,5,B01GE8HQQM,It was very good.  I am a huge King Tut fan and have several versions of opening the tomb.  I will enjoy watching this many times.,1503446400,5,130,3.9615384615384617
7759424,5,B01GE8HQQM,"I love Britbox!! A really enjoyable series, fun way to spend a Friday night. Well written and acted by Sam Neill and Max Irons.",1503100800,5,127,4.333333333333333
7759425,4,B01GE8HQQM,"This is a four part mini-series docu-drama about the discovery of the tomb of King Tut, the pharaoh who made Steve Martin famous. The film has lots of drama from the backdrop of WWI and civil unrest to internal conflicts. Howard Carter, the discovery had a balancing act and two women who desire him, one brains and the other beauty with money. Not much of a mystery there.

This film was remarkably made without Ben Kingsley, John Rhys-Davies, Brendan Fraser, or Nicolas Cage. It's length felt shortened by the episodes and is worth a watch even though we know the ending. Good performances.

Guide: No nudity. Implied sex. 1 F-word.",1502496000,11,634,4.754545454545455

8762749,1,B01GE8HQQM,"What a disappointment. A miniseries about the mummy of Tutankhamun that never actually reveals the mummy! Views inside the tomb are infrequent and insufficient. There is no mention at all of the chamber off of the burial chamber, as if mentioning one out of a total of three rooms would just take too much time away from the dramatization of Howard Carter's supposed love life. Historically inaccurate from start to finish.",1516060800,5,423,4.971830985915493
