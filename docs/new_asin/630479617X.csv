7877154,3,630479617X,"THIS WAS A STRAIGHT TO VIDEO FILM UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN. SAM ELLIOTT STEPS OUT OF THE SADDLE TO PLAY A MOODY STREETCOP WHO IS BELIEVABLY FLAWED.
ITS A SHAME THIS WAS A MODERATE BUDGET, T.V. LIKE PRODUCTION FOR IT IS A GOOD STORY AND SHOWCASES SOME DECENT ACTING.
ELLIOTT'S LONGTIME PARTNER IS KNIFED AND ELLIOTT DISCOVERS IT JUST AS A THOUGHT TO BE SNITCH ARRIVES. THINKING THE SNITCH IS RESPONSIBLE, ELLIOTT PROCEEDS TO ADMINISTER SOME CURBSIDE JUSTICE.
ELLIOTT DISCOVERS HE HAS KILLED THE MAN AND DUMPS THE BODY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY.
THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE BODY IS DISCOVERED HOMICIDE DICK ELLIOTT IS ASSIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE MURDER HE COMITTED. HE HAS A NEW PARTNER IN TOW AND APPROACHES THE CHORE LACKADASICLY.
IN THE COURSE OF THE CASE ELLIOTT DISCOVERS THAT HIS DECEASED BUDDY WAS CROOKED AND FELLOW BAD COPS ACTUALLY KILLED HIM TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY THE SNITCH ELLIOTT'S CHARACTER KILLS TURNS OUT TO BE AN UNDERCOVER COP INVESTIGATING THE CORRUPT BOYS IN BLUE.
THIS OF COURSE LEADS TO THE INEVITABLE SHOWDOWN.
ELLIOTT PUTS FORTH A REMARKABLE EFFORT IN THIS FLICK THAT REALLY SHOWS HIS RANGE.
THE MOST MEMORABLE SCENE IS WHEN ELLIOTT IS INVITED FOR SUPPER AT HIS YOUNG PARTNERS HOME. THE ROOKIE DETECTIVES WIFE IS THE HOLIER THAN THOUGH, LIBERATED, LIBERAL TYPE AND SHE AND ELLIOTT CLASH HEAD ON. THE VERBAL SPARRING IS UNEXPECTED GENIUS FOR AN OTHERWISE MEDIOCRE FILM.
FOR SOME UNEXPLICABLE REASON ELLIOTTS CHARACTER WONT DRIVE A CAR. THIS IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND IS A LOOSE END THAT SHOULDVE BEEN EXPOUNDED ON OR EDITED OUT.
BUT ELLIOTT IS OUTSTANDING AS THE REMORSEFUL, BROODING, BURNT OUT COP WHO HAS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.",1046390400,,1661,4.831578947368421
