110351,5,0790740443,King of the B-Grade action movies! This is a classic that to be honest has enough of a plot and character development that I enjoy watching it over and over again.

110423,5,0790740443,"Sergeant Todd is the ""an old model soldier"" is disposed of in a trash heap on a foreign world.

Docile, benevolent, friendly people, whom survive off then heap, occupy this world.

The people find Sergeant Todd and assuming he is like them befriend him. Soon they find that he is engineered differently ad shun him. Todd also is confused, as the people do not act like normal soldiers. Moreover, even they discard him.

The powers that be decide that these people would make perfect fodder for training the newer model soldiers.

The people ashamed of their shunning of Todd decide to invest time in him to teach him their ways.
Nevertheless, will he be able to change or at least understand their society?
Worse still, will he become a bad influence?

Soon they find that they need his protection. Looks the planet is going to be used for war games and they are the vermin to be distorted.

Will and can Todd help?

Kurt Russell as Todd, takes this from what could have been a two dimensional future shoot-um-up and makes it a multidimensional story that one can relate to.

It is interesting how we use Sci-fi to mask or enhance moral tales to make them palatable.",1504483200,,1166,4.599033816425121

110442,5,0790740443,"excellent, very-well acted, great performance. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors, always has been. This is a different role for him to do. He did a great job. On this dvd, there are no special features, except  'cast' and what they have been in before. I was dissaponted in that, but the movie is good, 'R' rated, I believe, but only 1 'F' word, and 1 'Lord's name/Jesus"", and one very quick naked picture of a female, I think, on the cards.. like the back of the deck..

110443,3,0790740443,"Spoiler alert
One piece of dialogue would have made this film into something a little more than the average action hero shoot em up
""Get the children to shelter.""
Kurt Russell's portrayal of Todd 3465 at first seems ahead of its time; it smacks of the backstory you see in the extremely popular Halo franchise. But where the Mater Chief shows concern for his fellow soldiers (in the original trilogy from Bungie at least) and uses Cortana as the foil to his straight man often over-dried wit, Todd has no such banter. That's, of course, the point they were trying to make: all humanity has been trained out of him at this point.

Had he shown interest in the people his actions were protecting, Todd might have become more than the sum of his training. But, with no other orders to follow, this can as easily be viewed as a horror flick just as easily as an action film. He does not appear to base his actions on defending the people who sheltered him. He just ants to kill the other soldiers, get off the planet with his former squad mates and--heres where it easily could turn to horror--take the remaining breeding stock with him.",1494460800,,1133,4.5268292682926825

110459,4,0790740443,"Soldier is a great movie, not to be confused with the Ken Wahl movie The Soldier, which is fun too, and deserves to be remastered and released on DVD. The first fifteen minutes of Soldier are my favorite part of the movie. We watch the young Kurt Russell character growing up in a ruthless military training institution. You have to watch the Japanese movie Battle Royale to see the military treating kids as ruthlessly as the people in Soldier do. At least in Soldier most of the kids make it to adulthood. Most of the kids in Battle Royale die.

I split my time between watching sci-fi and fantasy, and reading sci-fi and fantasy.

I haven't seen any of the movies or TV series from the following book series, but I did read the first books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Twilight, Outlander, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Long Earth, Divergent, etc. I sample a lot of first books, but I don't read many complete series. (Who has that much time?) The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series by George Martin are a couple of exceptions.

Ive read both of those series more than once. Both are five star. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series are the best. The Game of Thrones TV series is also five star. The first two Hunger Games movies are five star, but then they got greedy and tried to make two movies out of the Mockingjay book when there was barely enough source material there for one movie. The first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy are better than third book, Mockingjay, and the first two movies, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, are better than the two Mockingjay movies.

Starship Troopers (1959) (not like the movie) by Robert A. Heinlein is the book that got me started in sci-fi adventures, and has remained one of my top five favorite military science fiction adventure stories for decades. The Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman, Armor (1984) by John Steakley, Enders Game (1985) by Orson Scott Card and Old Mans War (2005) by John Scalzi, round out my top five military sci-fi adventure stories.

If you like any of the above you might also like Jack Campbells The Lost Fleet series, Taylor Andersons Destroyermen series, Andre Nortons Star Soldiers, Andy Weirs The Martian, or Frank Herberts Dune. Other sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and J.R.R. Tolkien.",1490918400,,2593,4.740576496674057

This movie lets Russell show his stuff as he communicates with us through body language and facial expressions only. The words spoken by Russell in this sadly underrated movie are few and far between. But Russell proves he doesn't need words to tell us a complex story or move us so emotionally.

110524,5,0790740443,"One of my favorite movies.  SOLDIER looks at humanity in a very dark place; where callousness and domination are the only things left in the of our emotions.  Then the question is asked, ""Can such a warped person be changed by defeat at the hands of someone who is less human and the substitution of a more ancient form of civilization?""

The answer is yes in the movie.  Because of running time the change happens to fast, but as a message that hope is possible in the worst conditions it works.  Yes things progress to fast, the script is creaky and some of the acting is on broken stilts, flaws that exist in all of us.  So what?  Sometimes you need a little hope in the face of EVIL.",1473120000,,687,4.27906976744186

Like any commodity, it is only as good as it's output. This means that this is a seriously dark world with no room for error. And then what happens when you have been taught to do one thing your whole life and you are dumped on a planet where they don't have soldiers? You want a convincing view into PTSD, this provides it. You want an intriguing look at where a society can go both right and wrong. It'll give you that too.

I love this movie because of the development of the main character. You have the best of the best facing his fears and learning how to survive all over again. More than that, you get some seriously great action. If you are afraid of snakes, like I am, you have been warned.",1462924800,,850,4.182926829268292

110665,5,0790740443,"Kurt Russell has always had the makings of a military guy.  He just LOOKS it.  Yeah, I profiled.  But after spending more than 20 years in the Navy, I think I've seen a few of those guys around.  Russell, in my estimation, is also a darned good actor.  I've liked him in just about everything I've ever seen him in... and that goes back to the Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit and Computer Wore Tennis Shoes.

As Todd 3465, Russell begins the movie as a killing machine.  He has been removed from ""common"" society and placed into a military world.  He learns more about killing than life.  After being phased out, so to speak, he has to face a newer soldier (shades of Van Damme and Universal Soldier).  Left for dead, Russell is taken in by more human of the humans.  He learns there's more to life than killing and death.  Eventually, as in any movie of this sort, he has to drop the kid gloves and come out fighting.

Kurt Russell is far from an ordinary actor.  He managed to capture the essence of the characters needing played.  It seems that the further away from reality the character is, the better Russell is at portraying him.",1433721600,,1135,4.389423076923077

War has been declared but now he's taking it to them.

110681,2,0790740443,"This film is only marginally watchable. The storyline is highly predictable. The acting ranges from wooden (Russell), to unintentionally humorous (the villain with the thin 1930-s mustache). The special effects are bleh. But the film is also strangely poignant when you realize it was made in the late 1990's, just before our wars-without-end in the Middle East, and their aftermath of traumatized innocent populaces and discarded PTSD-afflicted warriors. Just be prepared to fast forward. A lot.",1426982400,,496,5.5394736842105265

110684,2,0790740443,"Talk about a case of intellectual constipation! Apparently, David Webb Peoples's original script had been sitting atop the desk of an executive who scratched his head and stared at it for over fifteen years before deciding not to slide it off into the waste basket. Thus, when the hands of the gods began to move in the script's favor, Kurt Russell came aboard to reign in the box office receipts worldwide but the film can only be what it is--and in my estimation, it's not much. Considering the script's DNA and its inherent biological relation to the 1982 gem ""Blade Runner,"" it is oddly unremarkable that Paul W. S. Anderson was attached to direct this instead of a director who could capably handle the fantasy aspects of futuristic movies (a la Mr. Scott). But the moronic, speedy Gonzales-inspired framing of ""Soldier"" recalls the furious dolt-mentality of ""Starship Troopers"" more so than it does the effervescent ""Blade Runner"", and there is so much violence and brutality (both aimed at and also issued by Russell's intentionally dummied up character) that it makes a sensitive viewer long for the poetry and level headedness of the Harrison Ford vehicle. It is my advice to those screenwriters wishing to ""make it"" in the industry that they study seriously the career of David Webb Peoples. Learning of the many battles that this man has had to fight over the years (""Unforgiven,"" ""The Blood of Heroes"", ""Ladyhawke"", ""Twelve Monkeys"", etc. to mention only a handful) is a thoroughly sobering lesson for all.
Still, as slim as its chances are of being taken seriously by science fiction film historians, ""Soldier"" (where are you Harlan Ellison, they took your title!) remains a watchable film for the sheer physicality of Russell's performance, and for the general interest that is insinuated in its original script. But be warned, I suspect that very little of that script remained at the time the cameras stopped popping and clicking off--it becomes a hideously over the top special effects shriek show much more than an actual intelligent movie. But if you like ridiculous action spectacles, this one will pass a Saturday night like a pebble through a garden hose. Unfortunately the film is flashy without displaying any real visual sense of imagination that could elevate beyond a level of routine action adventure (here, the future is merely furniture rather than being integral to the emotions of the story).
The DVD is, as usual, an unspectacular effort; I would love to have heard an audio commentary from Peoples, or from a historian, someone. But, as such, we must be left to sort out these unending production mysteries by use of the strength of our perceptive imaginations alone. And yet in the case of ""Soldier,"" I get the uneasy feeling that most involved are now simply too embarrassed to comment. D+",1426636800,,2825,4.962025316455696

110745,5,0790740443,"BOTTOM LINE: Well worth your time & money, SOLDIER has brains to go with its brawn and Kurt Russell delivers in what was probably his most physically demanding role since ""Escape From New York."" An action-packed yet introspective sci-fi flick. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): In the future, humans are genetically bred for the specific purpose of being living weapons - the ultimate fighting machines. Their success rate is impressive. However, when a new & improved generation of test tube soldier is developed a couple of decades later, the current versions suddenly find themselves decidedly obsolete. The brutal conditioning & rigorous military training which made them so successful as combat soldiers has also rendered them cold, emotionless, potentially lethal living weapons. They are deemed unsuitable for re-integration into mainstream society. So what do you do with these ""people"" when their time has come & gone? The government's answer: retire them. Permanently. However, one of these soldiers, (Kurt Russell), survives his 'retirement' (shot point blank & dumped onto a distant world that's literally a gigantic, planet-wide landfill). As we soon discover however, the trash world is NOT barren. Years ago, a small transport ship developed engine trouble and crashed there. The ship itself was damaged beyond repair, leaving crew & passengers with no way to escape ...or even signal for help. Thus, the survivors were forced to make the garbage planet their home. They adapted over time, learning to live off the leftover refuse of others. When Russell's soldier is unceremoniously dumped into their midst, he attempts to co-exist with them, unlearn much of what he was conditioned from birth to do and, ultimately, unravel the mystery of exactly what it is to be ""regular"" human being. But when the government learns that he survived and they return to ""clean up"" their oversight, the SOLDIER must take up arms once again and defend his newly adopted world & its inhabitants.

THOUGHTS: On the surface this is sort of an intergalactic, future-tech version of SHANE. That genre-defining western is an iconic film in its own right, and its story is elegant simplicity itself. Not coincidentally, SHANE's plot was also the blueprint for what was arguably the best of the original ""Mad Max"" films, and one of the best action films ever, 1982's THE ROAD WARRIOR. It's a real shame that there wasn't better recognition for SOLDIER when it came out. I recall renting it on VHS tape many years ago and I enjoyed it but somehow forgot about it. Not too long ago, while scanning Amazon's list of available sci-fi titles on Blu-ray, I saw SOLDIER on that list. I'd forgotten much of the plot but knew it had a ton of action and remembered it being a pretty good flick. Besides, it's got Kurt ""Snake Plissken"" Russel in the lead, so how can you go wrong? (Errr... Captain Ron not withstanding. LOL.) My wife & I both REALLY enjoyed this film.

The movie is tailor-made for the likes of Schwarzenegger, Stallone or Van Damme, so I was originally surprised to see Kurt Russell in this kind of role, but he certainly nailed it. Man, he is a BEAST here! He must have done some crazy-intense training to get into such impressive physical shape. He was the physical equal of any other action star of that era, but unlike those other guys Russell had decades of acting experience under his belt. He effectively pulled off a very complex role with almost no dialogue; using facial expressions & body language to convey emotion. I doubt any of those other action heroes would have been anywhere near as good, but Kurt was perfect. There's a scene that takes place shortly after he's been cast out by the trash-picker community, (they are fearful of the threat he represents), which crystallizes why Russell is such an excellent but criminally under-rated actor. He's hunkered down in a filthy drain pipe that's now his temporary home when his eyes well up and a single tear runs down his face. He wipes it off with his finger and stares at it with a confused, uncomprehending look on his usually stoic face. He haltingly attempts to process what has just happened, with no clue as to what this water from his eye is nor how it got there. A subtle yet brilliant insight into the mind of this soldier - and a clue that he is, every so slowly, transitioning into something more than just an unfeeling killing machine. There's some fairly deep thinking going on under the movie's surface if you take the time to look, yet the quiet, insightful moments are perfectly balanced by some gut-wrenching, bone-crunching action sequences and ""whoa!"" visual F/X shots. SOLDIER truly has the best of both worlds. The action scenes are blisteringly intense and the technical aspects of the film are equally inspiring as well.  The cinematography is gorgeous to look at, with some really beautifully shot scenes featuring Kurt bathed in sharp light & shadow. And a special shout-out to the intricate, over-the-top set designs on the trash planet. The level of detail is amazing. The way-cool, full-scale/practical massive military ""Crawler"" vehicles look like real tech, and represent a believable menace to the film's protagonists. Lastly, from a visual F/X standpoint SOLDIER still impresses, with no glaringly bad or outdated-looking CGI shots to belie the film's true age.

THE BLU-RAY: The Blu-ray presentation for SOLDIER sports a solid transfer that looks terrific. Considering that it's a 15+ year-old film which has had no restoration work done to it, the transfer is quite good. Unfortunately, the audio portion of the film isn't as good. Sound mix is very inconsistent; I was forced to turn the volume up to hear the soft dialogue, then dial it down to keep my eardrums from being blown out during the action/combat sequences but that's really the only gripe I have.",1405036800,6,5864,4.955284552845528

110752,5,0790740443,"Soldier is an action movie (duh) with heart and a message, but manages to be not the least corny, saccharin, or manipulative of audience emotions.  Kurt Russell should be invited to co-star in the next Expendables franchise film.  The lack of dialogue is a very good choice on the screenwriter's part. His character, Todd, is basically a robot with a human body, as he has been raised in a horrifying manner to ensure ultimate obedience and lack of free will.  Here is an individual who has killed women and children in cold blood, yet you love this character instantly.  It may be the guileless blue eyes of the actor, or Todd's  horrible upbringing.

The acting of costars is not to be forgotten.  Every actor is excellent, and it is a treat to see Gary Busey as a captain of the old soldiers.  LIke many of Busey's characters, the audience will have a love-hate relationship with him.  Jason Scott-Lee is unrecognizable as Todd's replacement.  I did not know who it was until I read the credits.  Losing his lean muscle, he is bulked up and bald.

Todd is cast out literally in the garbage, and finds himself on a planet that is used as a dump heap.  He meets survivors of a crash, who have created a society.  He is at once feared, yet welcomed.  During one scene, there is a very effective portrayal of PTSD that soldiers experience upon returning home.  A woman who takes him in causes feelings to arise in Russell.  But she is happily married, with a tiny son who will prove instrumental to Todd's downfall and ultimate recovery.

110768,5,0790740443,"This is one of my favorites -- maybe not everyone's favorite.  In some society -- we're not told much about it -- babies are 'recruited' to be military 'lifers' -- killing machines stripped of emotion or empathy.  Kurt Russell's character (his name is tattoed on his cheek, along with rank, blood type, etc.) is replaced by a 'better soldier', along with his squad. He's the lone survivor and is dumped, along with other refuse, on a 'land-fill' planet populated by colonists whose original ride crashed and they've been stuck there ever since.  Basically, it's GI Joe-meets-Bouder-Colorado (or Berkeley,CA -- take your pick). Into this mix comes the brutal commander who 'Decommissioned' his squad,  leading the 'better soldiers' on a training exercise.  They're told that anyone inhabiting the planet should be considered 'hostile'. So you've probably got a good idea where this is going. But I think it was a really novel plot. Kurt Russell's acting fills about 30 seconds of the movie, the rest is his non-communicative, stone-faced fighting-machine persona. Nonetheless, the film develops the characters among the colonists -- naive collectivists who have no comprehension of the brutality of war. The ending, I thought, was satisfying.  I'd definitely recommend this one",1396137600,,1276,5.292079207920792

The first time I watched this movie, I was taken by the hauntingly beautiful song in the middle... ""Night Ride Across The Caucasus"" by Loreena McKennitt.

He had very little dialog yet was able to convey every emotion and internal pain.

Of course, I have always been a Kurt Russell fan and Connie Nielsen (Gladiator) also performed to her superb capabilities.

I love all movies where the protagonist rises above their situation. I think if this has not already been designated as a cult classic it should be.

110821,5,0790740443,"Although Kurt Russell was originallly hit hard by critics for this role & not showcasing his acting ability, I would tend to say that is a base analysis. Kurt Russell's performance is excellent when the theme and context of the movie is considered.  Kurt Russell is laconic and uses short terse speech - yet what would offer more coherency with the child-soldier plot?  Kurt Russell just sells a caracter who knew nothing else but being a soldier and at war from childhood forward.  So those who think his performance is weak, I would be interested in viewpoints as to how else the role could have been portrayed.

As for the film overall, I think it addresses issues that are quite relevant in today's society - we are in an era where science & technology are advancing so quickly, the risk of hubris in disgarding the value of proven science, technology, etc. in favor of that which is a novel advancement (state of the art, yet comparatively low diffusion and little time-testing) is a clear reality.  So the film may seem just dumb action, I think it has a relevant message to deliver.

And for those who want to check out of analyzing subtle details in film & just watch a solid action flick, Soldier delivers.  It is packed with action and watching the one-man wrecking crew snatch revenge so efficiently and systematically, it makes for viewing more than once or twice well worth it.

So if you have doubts about Soldier, I would recommend giving it a go - when it first hit theatres, if memory serves, critical reception was less than enthusiastic...over time though, Soldier continues to gain new audience where similar plots like Halo or Enders Game have been introduced and spur interest in the idea of the ultimate soldier.  And the average person has probably had exposure or has made observations from what is happening in the world - war is more and more present in the publics eye - that the film has now become not so far fetched and an easy concept to grasp...so much in fact, the film has acheived a cult following, redeeming its original launch to theatres.",1388966400,,2077,4.668493150684932

110832,4,0790740443,"I rated it a 4 because I thought is was really good although not GREAT. As usual Kurt Russell is one of the best actors there has ever been in many movies. This is no exception.
It is a futuristic movie where the existing government of the Earth takes only the babies that show more spunk almost immediately after birth  and are raised in carefully regulated conditions to become super soldiers.

The military weeds out the ones who show weakness in the slightest form by simply shooting them down. They keep the best only.
One such Soldier(Kurt Russell) is one of the best , that is, until he starts to age. A commander of another regimen of young soldiers puts the older ones to the test. Russell and the other aging soldiers are put to the test and if they can prove themselves worthy of still being the best their lives are spared.

Of course they cannot beat the younger , fresher soldiers they are pitted against. And so they shoot and kill the older soldiers that are weaker  but leave the ones who still hold promise for other tasks other than fighting . Russell's character is supposed to have died and is taken to a ""waste planet"" where all the rest of the trash is taken . This planet has incredible weather conditions . Soldier manages to survive and wakes up in the ""trash bin"" but survives the possibility of being crushed in the falling debris.

Once there he is weak and to his amazement finds that there are regular humans who have been able to survive and were accidentally dropped on the planet years before.

There Soldier finds his almost robotic programming fighting against not harming the people who live there.

I don't want to give up the rest of the movie. But it is interesting to watch how he deals with his humanity and his programmed fierceness in a world of regular human beings. The movie has a good story line and a great acting staff.

110837,4,0790740443,Im sure that Soldier appeals to the masculine members for its violence and shoot-em-up blow-em-up visions that seem to appeal to many today. I found something else. This is of course fantasy. An infant was designated to become a soldier. He was from the beginning exposed and encouraged by violence and void of affection. I imagine in reality this child would have died long ago. In spite of all that there was something in side that made him basically good. He was confused when he landed in a caring community and  simple kindness seemed to overwhelm him. The scene that struck me was the child opening his arms for the soldier to pick him up in the end.,1384819200,,656,4.559322033898305

110845,4,0790740443,"This movie is not what you think it is.  By viewing the trailer you might get the impression that this is just another ho-hum action movie set in the future.  No, it is far more than that.  This movie is more of a look at the human condition.  It takes place far in the future.  Some grim military personnel are in a nursery looking at charts and carefully selecting certain infants.  You quickly learn that these infants are selected to become soldiers.  From birth to adulthood all they are taught is how to be the perfect soldier and nothing else. They end up resembling Terminator robots, in nature, and seemingly devoid of emotions.  Todd (Kurt Russel) is the best of them.  You see that through the years he has amassed an impressive amount of victories and experience.  However, nothing lasts forever.  There's a new generation of super soldier that is coming out.  These are genetically created humans that are faster, stronger and physically superior.  The 1st generation soldiers are considered obsolete and expendable.  After an arranged confrontation between a few of the new/old soldiers, Todd is left for dead on some forgotten planet/asteroid that is used for trash.  He is rescued by a harmless/friendly group of castaways who were marooned here.  This is where the movie really starts in my mind.  Now Todd is among regular humans and families where his skills don't fit in.  All he has known is killing and death, now he is exposed to feelings and experiences he has never dealt with.  What would that be like?  Kurt Russell does a great job with this.  He doesn't have a lot of lines, but his expressions and movements have a huge impact on this character and he sells it wonderfully.  It's really interesting when a beautiful woman (Nielsen) gets near him and how he reacts to it.  Ingrained human instinct fighting against years of brainwashing and conditioning from birth.  He really struggles in this environment.  Then it really becomes interesting when the 2nd generation super soldiers show up on a training mission on this planet with orders to kill any living thing they come across.  Now Todd finds himself the only thing standing between them and this group of people who came to his aid.  It's two full squads of soldiers that are his superior....or so it seems.  I won't spoil the movie, but I will say it's an excellent showdown that pits strength against experience.
Overall, a terrific movie.  Great cast, fantastic story, and some impressive action scenes. The blu-ray is pretty darn good and easily worth the money.",1380758400,,2552,4.829099307159353
110846,5,0790740443,Not sure what more I can say other than we enjoyed the movie but as all movies go that is very subjective.  Its about a genetically engineered soldier that they replace with a better soldier... or at least they though,1380758400,,217,4.425

110849,4,0790740443,"I liked Kurt Russell since I saw him in John Carpenters The Thing, he's just a good all around actor even in this movie where he barely even speaks, his expressions do all the talking.
This is a B movie but the story's good and so are all the actors, including Gary Busy.
Russell plays a man trained since childhood for one purpose only and that is to be a soldier and follow orders without question but as he grows older he becomes obsolete and is cruelly replaced and dumped on a waste disposal planet, that's all I'll give away about the movie so I don't give away any more spoilers.
Connie Nielson in this movie who I recognized from the movie Gladiator and is as beautiful as ever.
I saw this movie in 1999 and thought it was worth buying and I've watched it several times since I've received it from Amazon.

110851,4,0790740443,"Is this the best movie ever made?  No.  It is, though, a fun movie to watch.  Russell does a fairly good job displaying various emotions (which is a struggle for his character) throughout the movie little to no dialogue.  The idea of super soldiers is an old one, but this movie deals with what to do with them when they are 'obsolete'.
You need to suspend disbelief to watch this movie.  Yes, nobody could survive what appears to be a long space flight in a trash ship.  Just forget about things like that when you see 'Soldier'.  Other reviewers have torn apart all the things that don't make sense.  If I did that to every movie, I would find it hard to actually enjoy any movies.
Watch this for what it is, an action movie.  Look past the bad music, low budget special effects and mute little boy - all my opinion.  The soundtrack is a little annoying, but not completely terrible.  However, I didn't like the little boy's part in the movie.  Yes, I know he was there to show the humanity of Russell's character, but it was too hokey for me.

110854,4,0790740443,"I was bored so since I have enjoyed some of Kurt Russell's other movies I decided to watch
Soldier using my Kindle Fire HD. It starts out slow and it begins by showing how these soldiers are taken right from the hospital after they are born. They take you into the future and the odd thing about it was there was very little said by any of the soldiers except to say yes sir no sir and they followed orders even if it meant certain death. He (Russell) was old school and put up against a genetically superior soldier in a fight where he was killed. They dumped Russell into a garbage scow of sorts and while the ship was going to the planet where it would be dumped he became aware of his surroundings and before he knew it he was dumped on what seemed like a planet that was void of life. He was injured yet after reaching the surface he managed to find shelter and his military training kicked in. He began the process of healing his wounds so that he could get strong enough to learn more about his surroundings. He gets caught in a violent wind storm and some stranded humans found him and one of their women helped nurse him back to full strength. The entire time he said absolutely nothing though they used close up shots of his eyes and face that gave you an idea of what and how he was feeling.

As he got used to being among this stranded group of humans he became less violent though you could see just how battle hardened he was when he did his daily workouts. He didn't say much of anything but kept watching one of the women who was married that had nursed him back to health. As time passed he was teaching children some pretty violent behavior so they had a town hall type of meeting and they banished him outside their compound. He went not saying a single word and found safe haven not far from the other humans. Then things begin to pick up, they are training the super soldiers by going to planets where they were most likely not going to find any kind of resistance. Once their commander realized there as a large number of settlers on the planet he gave his soldiers orders to wipe them from the planet not knowing that there was one lone soldier who he thought was dead was alive and well on that planet. As you might have guessed he crossed paths with these new super soldiers including the one that had supposedly killed Russell. He did go unnoticed by these soldiers and manages to warn the humans who had saved him that they were in danger. On his own with no real weapons he started taking out these so called super soldiers which made their commander think there was an organized fighting force on that planet.

Russell then got help from the men that had banished him and as he took out these soldiers and then the armed vehicles they were driving until he got to the one that had the soldier that had killed or thought he had was in command of. It didn't take Russell long to disable it forcing a one on one fight between the two of them again. You might be able to guess what happened this time around but there was a twist where the husband of the woman that had nursed Russell back to health came to help him and ended up being killed but as he was dying he told Russell to take care of his wife and son. This is where you see signs of human emotions as Russell had a tear on his cheek and then several more but by the look on his face he had no idea what they were. It did seem that the man's death spurred him on with even more anger as he ripped his way through what was left of the newer soldiers until he caught up with their commander and...you can see what happens without me telling you.

It must have been an extremely difficult part to play for Russell but one he managed to pull off quite well. I don't remember having seen this film in theaters, if it was it was for a very short period of time and many missed seeing what can easily called a diamond in the rough.

While I could point out all the random ""huh?"" moments where you catch editing that jumps ahead in time/space and simply breaks visual continuity, I'll just point out that this movie commits the biggest mistake of any action flick... it's boring. Yes, there are plenty of nods to many sci-fi movies if you catch them. Yes, the soldier (Russel) is suitably imposing, as is the main ""enemy."" (Jason Scott Lee) These things were not enough though. There was simply not much action and not much actual exploration of the emotion that is obvious under the Soldier's silent persona. Everything was handled rather ham-fisted and I didn't care for anyone in the story. (the creators gave me no reason to) There was so much dead-space in the middle 3rd of the flick that could have carried that emotion but instead gave us a Van Damme-esque 80s movie montage of ""recovery"" that I pretty much checked out. I only continued because I knew that the Russel and Lee's characters had to have an epic fight at the climax... but that is where the movie gave me the final let-down. The fight was horribly choreographed, badly shot and edited to either show those elements off, or it was so bad that the editor just gave up... thankfully the fight was quick. <sigh>",1374364800,,1422,4.646825396825397

of humanity. When he saves a young boy from being bitten by a poisonous viper, and instructs the boy as to how to

Somehow this movie sneaks into you and before you know it, you find yourself actually 'feeling' the struggle of the 'Soldier'.  I rarely experience this in any movies regardless of how recent or old they may be.  I actually appreciated this movie far more now than I was able when it first came out.  I was too young to appreciate it on it's initial release date.

'Soldier' really is a well made movie with a great performance by Kurt Russel who managed to capture a very subtle, and therefore realistic portrayal of a human being in deep struggle with his programming.  In my view, the strength of Kurt's performance was so strong that he actually made it possible not to focus to much on any of the movies shortcomings.  In most action movies, there always seems to be a glaring, foolish, unbelievable scenario going on with the plot, presentation, and bad guys.  With this movie,you don't rally focus on anything but the inner truth of the 'Soldier' attempting to process his new position in reality, a position which his programming [brainwashing] seems to have entirely excluded.

I give it 5 stars and this is how and why I arrive at 5 : In comparison to the last 50 or so movies I have seen, it IS, by far, an easy 5 star experience.",1372896000,2,1721,4.449044585987261

110896,3,0790740443,"The idea for the plot of the movie all together is decent. A soldier finding his humanity by persevering through social situations in a community he did not have the emotional nor verbal tools to cope with. Kurt Russel plays brilliantly in his role considering the limited script and poor editing that must have went into this movie. My reasoning for this is because he doesn't out of the blue portray his soldier as suddenly becoming verbally fluent on his intents. But rather goes through the movie displaying his ideas and intentions in a physical or vocally base level, such as grunts and the like, or perhaps intense stares.

The plot to this movie had much potential. But the overall product left much to be desired. Character development was sketchy, and could of been much better if they dedicated more time to add depth to the characters involved. But as I have said before. The plot jumps around and loses points for pretty much making the main antagonist in the film a laughable joke of a sod.

A standard but well done story, with good effects for a B type movie, and some great action and fight scenes. Once again Russell creates a memorable tough guy persona and communicates much while speaking little. Not an easy thing to do. Few actors have ever done that well, and Kurt is quite commendable.

This is also not done in that dreary, boring, too dark, monotone look so many movies of this genre are filmed like nowadays. No wannabe video game look please.

Jason Scott Lee also puts on a solid performance as the manufactured human archenemy along with some others you will recognize.

I also like the human spiritual and philosophical side as well. Russell is trained from birth to be less than human, a thoughtless, merciless, coldblooded killer by those that think they are better, smarter, superior types who think they can do what they want to get what they want.

In the end Kurt and the lowly outcasts demonstrate it's not just your upbringing, or what you have or your station in life that makes you special or great, it's what's inside that counts.  A good moral, if not always true in reality. But this is fiction after all.

The dialogue, or lack there-of, speaks volumes.  If you're looking for a Star Wars or Van Damme film, go buy those, because this is a much deeper story.  Kurt Russell was fantastic.  His facial expressions more than made up for the scarce dialogue.  He is a soldier, selected at birth and trained for war.  After 35 years or so, he and his teammates are replaced by ""better"" lab-created, chemically maintained, solders.  He knows nothing else, as this was his entire life.  Ultimately he is marooned on a planet where is finds and is welcomed by a small group of people that crash landed there.  He is forced out of the community, out of fear, but returns to their aid when the new soldiers accidentally show up while on a training mission.

110909,4,0790740443,"If you never thought Kurt Russell was a good actor, you might want to take a look at this. A very dark and dreary vision of a possible future for mankind, strewn out among the stars where values are related to profit or military worth. The human condition is second to everything else.  Russell is a soldier that has been bred and trained from childhood to be hard and tough beyond compare, But when he is betrayed and discarded, he finds himself feeling some level of compassion for a community of dejected, discarded people, struggling to survive, who are being attacked and destroyed for sport by Russell's ex Marine comrades.
Kurt doesn't hardly say a dozen words, but tells more stories with a look than Zoolander. Not a fast paced action thriller, but well worth the time spent, this is a haunting look at what our future could be if we fail to retain our compassion for one another, and humanity in the choices we make.
Oh, and for the girls, Russell was at his physical peak here, and is quite impressive - especially if you can remember ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"".",1366588800,,1079,4.590673575129534
110910,2,0790740443,"All great fan of Kurt Russell as I am, I still hated this film and I hardly managed to finish watching it. This review doesn't contain spoilers, as there is hardly anything to spoil in this disaster...

In a near future an evil (of course!) militaristic US government, controlled (of course!) by evil greedy corporations willing (of course!) to deprive common people of everything they have, creates a military unit composed with abducted children, who are raised to become sociopathic killers - they are supposedly the best fighting force ever. This is an incredibly stupid idea by the way, NEVER tried by any armed forces in any country - little advice here to scenario writers: in reality sociopaths are unable to follow orders and cooperate and therefore make always the WORST possible soldiers! Then, at one moment, one of those soldiers becomes damaged, is declared obsolete and is dumped with other garbage on an enormous junkyard on a remote planet. There, he is taken in charge by a band of people hiding from authorities and scavenging for scraps amongst the military refuse...

The initial idea of a battle scarred, emotionally damaged veteran receiving a second chance in life by joining a community of ultimate underdogs was really GREAT! Producers secured also a good cast for this film, by bringing on board Kurt Russell, Gary Busey, Connie Nielsen, to name just those three. The budget was also generous - in 1998 60 millions bucks was a lot of money...

However, to direct the film somebody picked up Paul W.S. Anderson, a young man who at that time made only three films: ""Shopping"" (which nobody noticed), ""Mortal Kombat"", which was (for my personal taste) a huge disappointment (even if it made a lot of money) and finally ""Event Horizon"", one of the absolutely WORST SF films I ever saw... Therefore, it is not a big surprise, that ""Soldier"" was a disaster waiting to happen... And it happened - for once, a really BAD big budget movie lost also a lot of money, as few people went to see it, hearing the HORRIBLE word of mouth raging all around.

Paul W.S. Anderson redeemed himself a little later, by making ""Alien vs. Predator"" (a film which certainly is not a masterpiece, but which I always kinda liked) and especially the very, very good ""Pandorum"" (see my reviews of both of those films); it seems also that ""Resident Evil"" franchise is not bad - but here I can not say, as I didn't see any of those films. But I digress...

My problem with this film is the total absence of scenario - like in ""Event Horizon"", absolutely nothing makes sense. From the beginning to the end it is so boring that I had to fast forward parts of it. Dialogs are inexistent and actors as good as Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen and Gary Busey are not allowed to act. At all. Action scenes are ridiculous, people keep doing stupid things without ever stopping to think and the ending is really just a lame opening to a possible sequel - which, thanks God, will never be made.

So why two stars? Well, to be absolutely clear, this is a ONE STAR film, but by stretching my more merciful side to the maximum, I managed to scrap some small pieces to combine them together in a second star:

- 1/2 of a star for presence of Connie Nielsen; she is not allowed to actually act in this film (nobody is) but her simple presence allowing us to contemplate her magnificent beauty (shining brightly even when she wears dirty rags) is certainly one of the very few positive things in this film

- 1/4 of a star for Michael Chiklis - seeing the future Vic Mackey with some hair still attached is always a pleasure - and also honestly, how could I not like him playing a character named Jimmy Pig? (A huge LOL here...)))!) But his screen time is short

- 1/4 of a star for ONE image from the film, figuring prominently on the DVD cover. Whoever decided to dump the mighty (albeit still conventionally propelled) aircraft-carrier USS ""Franklin D. Roosevelt"" (CV-42), usually referred to by her crew as ""Swanky Franky"" or ""Rusty Rosie"", on a military junkyard on another planet deserved definitely a rise and a cookie...))) That was really a great idea and I loved this picture instantly from the moment I saw it. Be advised however, that in the real life USS ""Franklin D. Roosevelt"", commissioned in 1945, was retired in 1977 and scrapped soon after, in 1978, by River Terminal Development Company in Kearny, New Jersey, a pretty alien destination by itself, if most of New Yorkers are to be believed...)))

So bottom line, this is a VERY BAD movie, which had a great potential - but all of which was cruelly wasted. I hated this film, it bored me almost to death, I had to fast forward parts of it and I gave it away for a charity sale immediately after. Avoid it with an astronomical level of determination.",1366243200,,4794,4.636042402826855

My only gripe is that they didn't built an all-convincing set for filming the movie(I mean particularly the base where the refugees hide).

Kurt has always been a very good actor, but it is easy to see that here he shines despite the very few lines he was given. The story itself was a surprise that it was not polished and it was a surprise to see that Todd, as a soldier did not make any smooth transition from his old life into a new one as easily as is too often portrayed in films. Todd, as a soldier, having known no other life was showing the stresses of what real soldiers have to deal with in such transitions when their training fails them in adapting to new situations. Alone, he could have survived, but amongst the refugees by whom he was befriended, he found it hard to live as he could not so readily adapt to their ways, so unlike his own, dredging up feelings long dormant and purposefully buried in his old life. However, when the action returned, one could see he burned with a new resolve as he returned to his old life to protect the people who took him in and to prove once and for all who was really ""obsolete.""
Busey was excellent as an old line officer who still had feelings for his men and Issacs was best as the one who viewed his new line soldiers as just commodities, machines to serve a purpose while placing himself above them.

The movie tries to make some comments on society like soldiers trained from childhood under a harsh and tyrannical system that are just stored in a cabinet labeled ""break glass in case of war"", but it really falls short in any real meaningly message.  There is just not enough time taken to develop this aspect of the film as most of it is dedicated to action scenes.

Todd a soldier who was chosen at birth and trained to be a stone cold heartless killing machine until one day while facing off against the next generation of genetically engineered soldiers, he is beleived killed and disposed of on a planet of garbage. Todd finds on the planet people from a transporter ship that crashed who now call it home, and as he lives with them they help him unearth something he never knew he had, his soul. Todd spends his time with them eating, gardening, training and looking back on his life and slowly realizes with each passing moment that his life has been a travesty of people he killed because they either got in the way or he never thought about them at all because he had orders to hide behind. But Todd is looked at as too dangerous by their captain and is banished, as he sits by the fire, he cries wondering if the soul he had. The one buried in spent shell casings, shrapnel, blood, tears, sweat and the filth of combat had been sold. Sold to a lie. The genetically engineered soldiers come to the planet for a training exercise and are ordered to kill any inhabitants because their considered hostile, and Todd springs into action. The new soldiers are faster, stronger, and have unbelivable endurance but their not smarter as Todd uses his knowledge of the planet and its geography to beat them back. Then he faces off against the leader of the soldiers, Caine in a climatic battle of where Todd demonstrates that Cain maybe his better physically but he never learned to mind his surroundings. But the scene that amazes all is at the end when Nathan walks up to Todd, and with little to no ceremony he adopts Todd by putting his arms out so Todd can pick him up. His meaning to Todd is he needs a dad, his mom needs a new man, and Todd could use them to help make him more human. A great Sci-fi film.",1347148800,,1867,4.414492753623189
110941,3,0790740443,"Soldier was a bust at the box office that cost $60M to make but brought in only $14M domestically and was vilified by the critics (10% at Rotten Tomatoes). But because of terrific performances by lead actors Kurt Russell and Connie Nielson, it has become a cult classic.

The film centers on a secret military program in the somewhat near future established (no nationality is mentioned) to recruit and indoctrinate soldiers at birth rather than at the age of majority. Despite numerous successes in a number of wars, the soldiers in the program are retired in favor of a new super-soldier program that genetically engineers its recruits rather than screening the naturally born. The noncom that is the lead soldier of the older unit (Russell) is cashiered and dumped on a remote colonial outworld outpost. He is rescued by the shipwrecked colonists and repays the favor when the same unit of super-soldiers stumbles across the colony by accident and tries to exterminate the colonists.

This isn't the gritty and gutty military of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2002), but the glossy Hollywood military of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997). No surprise really as the choreography is done by David Tattersall, responsible for the awful Star Wars Episodes 1-3 (1999-2005), Speed Racer (2008), and Gulliver's Travels (2011). Why is this a problem? Because Kurt Russell and supporting actors Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee, Jason Scott Lee, and most of the bit characters are playing it super straight and intense. When the foppish Jason Isaacs strolls in as the critically important character Colonel Mekum (the superior officer of the super-soldiers), the movie never quite recovers from the dichotomy between the two very different acting styles and cartoonish visuals.

Downsides: The film's script bludgeons the viewer with self-indulgent pro- environment and anti-military morality. The sets have a silly Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome-style (1985) feel.  Combat sequences mostly consist of explosions and various stuntmen hurling through the air, arms and legs flailing--something out of a 70's or 80's era Chuck Norris action flick.

Upsides: Kurt Russell and Connie Nielsen's performances. Russell plays an emotionally damaged soldier who has known nothing beyond fear and discipline. Nielson plays an empathetic colonist that tries to bridge the emotional gap. It is the scenes between the two where the movie really shines. Russell finds himself attracted to Nielsen in a raw fashion he is wholly unfamiliar with. He stares at her longingly, but uncomprehendingly, and locks up stiffly when Nielsen tries to hold him during a particularly emotional encounter. Nielsen, a married woman, finds herself attracted to the tough, resourceful, and hyper-masculine soldier. She struggles between her loyalties to her husband, her only son, and the hostile and insulated colonial community while still trying to protect Russell from a world he does not understand.

It is Nielsen and Russell's performances in this film that earn it a third star (out of five) in this reviewer's opinion, elevating it above standard straight-to-video fare. In spite of all its shortcomings, the movie is engaging and entertaining and well worth the time to watch it.",1342569600,2,3251,5.3274853801169595

I have never been able to count the number of words he says throughout the movie, but I suspect it may be under 100. Yet his performance should have received at least an Academy Award nomination. It is a remarkable performance through expressions, composure, and delivering each word exactly as a professional should. I like Kurt Russell. One of my favorite movies is Overboard, which is night and day from this film. And he got a lot of notice in Miracle. But his performance in Soldier is the best I have seen. I have little doubt that he was overlooked for a nomination because of the nature of the rest of the movie. It is dark. And there are significant moments of violence which some groups prefer not to watch. But I recommend it just to watch him handle this part. Maybe someone else here already has. If not, try counting the number of words he say. I know it's likely around somewhere. As others have said, this movie grew on me.",1294099200,4,1103,4.492537313432836

actual, prolonged combat can re-configure how a human being will interact with society.  Combining great action sequences with the exploration of how a human being breed for war will experience being ""thrown away"" (as if that does not happen in our civilized society), this film is a real gem I've watch several times.  I consider it one of Kurt Russell's best performances.  The majority of Kurt's acting is done through his eyes and facial expressions.  No easy task for any actor.  And, that seeming ""blank"" look that Kurt uses as he sizes up situations and people?  That is a look I've seen before. It is very real.  It is how predators look at you, both human and animal, trying to decide if you are a threat, a victim or you just don't matter either way.  And, I will have to admit, I'm also a sucker for a ""feel good"" ending to an action film where the ending could have easily been ruined with melodrama.  'Soldier' is not for everyone.  Yes, 'Soldier' deals with complex issues simplisticly.  Yes, the film borrows from other sci-fi action films.  However, at least Soldier tries to deal with difficult issues and
where it borrows from other films, it does so very well.  'Soldier' a winner for those who appreciate a fun, interesting sci-fi film.  I know I added it to my collection.",1289001600,4,1518,4.700757575757576

Kurt Russell is my husband's favorite actor, so that's probably why the movie ranks so high with him.  I watch it for Jason Isaacs, who plays a secondary part as a nasty military guy.

I had a greater appreciation of the movie after listening to the commentary by the director and others.  It's very informative and fairly funny in parts (the interplay between Paul Anderson and Jason Isaacs, who are apparently friends as well as co-workers, is very enjoyable).  Sometimes I think it helps to hear what they went through while making the movie and why they chose to do this or that.  I was amazed to hear that Russell broke his ankle early in the shoot and they had to work around that.  I was also surprised that prior to filming he spent over a year in the gym creating his look for the movie.  That's dedication.

I won't go over the plot since others have done it very well already.  The movie is a Western disguised as a sci-fi story.  I don't think it's as derivative of other movies as Anderson's ""Event Horizon"", which is in its favor.

Sgt. Todd, though he utters barely 25 words in the entire movie, skillfully represents what happens when the perfect trained killer is suddenly dumped back into civilized society with little or no reintegration.  It's not a matter of -if- governments/entities decide to enact lifelong soldier-training programs similar to those portrayed in Soldier (it has already happened), but how long before more ""civilized"" governments follow suit to defeat them.  Long after the credits roll, you will find yourself wondering whether the US government currently has such a training program and how, just how, are we going to reintegrate all the ""trained solders"" currently being held in Guantanimo Bay back into their respective societies.  Or, for that matter, how well our -own- US soldiers adjust when dumped back into society after doing multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I'm unsure which of these it eventually ends up being, but the one thing I'm sure it's not is a good time.

The story: Todd (Russell) is a soldier born into a lifelong military program turning out ace killers. However, when a rival program pits its stronger, faster units against the older models in an exhibition, Todd is presumed killed and his body is dumped on a designated garbage planet. Here, he settles in with a close-knit community of exiles and slowly begins to attain a level of humanity he never knew...until the new breed of soldiers, in an effort to gain combat experience, is dispatched to the planet to weed out its inhabitants.

As said before, the film lacks action - or, at the very least, lacks satisfying action. With the exception of two encounters with rival soldier Caine (Jason Scott Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-The-Bruce-Lee-Story/dp/0783226985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story</a>), Russell has no hand-to-hand fights, and the only firefight - a slow-moving 17-on-1 shoot-`em-up - doesn't occur until the film's last twenty minutes. The rest of the movie focuses solely on Todd getting acquainted and trying to fit in with his hosts, and frankly, this is very boring. Though an accomplished actor, Russell lacks the subtlety here to make his near-stoic character appear like anything other than a dummy who doesn't understand what the heck is going on at any time. Expect lots of pursed-lip, wide-eyed staring.

The rest of the performers - including Connie Nielsen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Hour-Photo/dp/B00007976T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Hour Photo</a>) and Gary Busey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon/dp/0790729695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon</a>) - are generally passable in their portrayals but aren't given much opportunity to add to the story. The film's graphics are visibly outdated, and the sets range from okay to dollar-budget. However, the more significant fault lies in the film's sense of morality: the faction that bred Russell's character is seen exercising cruelty and infanticide, yet when the bigger and better soldiers with the cockier commander (Jason Isaacs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Patriot/dp/B000ZHB6R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Patriot</a>) arrive, the folks behind Todd's creation are suddenly turned into good guys. Call me square, but I don't buy it. In addition, the over-the-top militarism displayed has no purpose: it's never revealed why a program to turn out such soldiers is even required, and the attack on the exiled colony happens for no other reason than that the commander being a jerk.

While I was expecting Anderson's trademark style of pop-direction and not much of a story, ""Soldier"" is a significant step beneath even his personal average. It's not hard to see why the film flopped back in 1998. Kurt Russell devotees have definitely seen better from their man. Leave this one on the shelf.",1214352000,,3741,6.30078125

Although he was raised to have no feelings and be the best soldier he could be he develops a liking for these civilians.

Kurt Russel is particularly fantastic in this because he barely even says 25 words the whole show.  Yet, he is able to portray such a complex character that transforms as the storyline unfolds.

After being trained from birth to be an elite killer soldier, following orders at all costs, and completely devoid of humanity and human feelings, Todd finds himself disposed of when he is replaced by a better soldier.  He is dumped on a waste disposal planet where survivors of a crash are living.  He lives among them and ultimately defends them when the ""better soldiers"" arrive on a training mission.

This movie moves very fast, so we are not bored at all.  And the storyline is so interesting, though somewhat bloody, that we are engrossed the entire time.  I recommend this for fans of science fiction and unusual science fiction since Kurt Russel does such a good job as a main character who barely speaks but tells an incredible story.",1198195200,,1024,4.811428571428571

110986,4,0790740443,"This movie reminds me of the graphic novel War Machine. The novel is about a genetically created soldier who was trained since birth to serve with unfaltering loyalty and does so until he is abandoned. Both the book and the movie have that similar story of a futuristic soldier trained since birth who defies his leaders for a moral solution. They are two very different and specific stories mind you. But I digress. Soldier is kind of a mixed bag of action and a little heart, with some quirks as well. Ultimately what you get is a great movie with some gaping flaws that still make it a pretty good flick in the end.

I think the biggest feather in this movie's cap is seeing dispossessed soldier Todd, played by Kurt Russell, interact with civilians and try to unlearn his conditioning. It is not done in a cheesy way like having Todd shed his first tear or anything like that. The script seems to respect the fact that you cannot change yourself overnight. Also there is a love interest of sorts that is pretty much unrequited. At least through the course of the movie. Again these things don't change overnight. Kurt hardly says a line and still shines in this movie. Some might disagree, but I think Kurt Russel's acting was very well done and appropriate for the kind of character he was. Most of it is in his eyes. The acting is real subtle but very effective.

Cinematography was nice. Colored lenses were used in basic but effective ways. The junk planet landscape gave a good post-apocalyptic feel (again with color filters adding to the ambience). The guns and tech should keep you military types drooling. Big guns and even more massive assault vehicles were definitely fun to see in action. The special effects are very good and not overdone, and that's always a nice touch.

The plot is solid enough. The thing is they do some odd things in the movie. I mean REALLY odd things like officers ordering these super soldiers to fight each other to the death to prove a point and other strangeness. The truly stupid stuff comes around the end when Todd goes toe to toe with newer soldiers. I can't figure out why genetically enhanced soldiers that are made to ignore pain scream like little girls when they are dying. Also the soldiers themselves don't seem to have much of a concept of small unit tactics. They just walk in and shoot. I suppose that is explained well enough with captains and colonels arguing over the unit having no real combat experience. Todd doesn't seem to have a problem using surprise tactics, but the 'new recruits' didn't seem to get it. I don't know... this military of the future is pretty dirt dumb.

This DVD is pretty sparse on special features, but you do get a pretty informative commentary by director Paul Anderson, co-producer Jeremy Bolt and Jason Isaacs (the mean colonel from the movie). One little tidbit they clarify on the commentary is how this movie is supposed to be part of the Blade Runner universe. If you have a good eye you will catch little hints in the movie as well (if not the commentary will point them out for you). Other than that you get get some production notes, the trailer and some subtitles in English and French. Not exactly a sweet lineup, but you do get a good commentary.

Soldier is a good film. I think Russell and the social evolution of his character Todd is what makes the movie more than just another sci-fi shoot fest. If the story overview sounds interesting to you and you can forgive some oddball soldier maneuvers then go ahead and see this movie. Soldier won't win any awards, but I finished watching it thinking the movie was pretty good.",1182902400,3,3629,4.602782071097373
110987,3,0790740443,"Critically smashed at the time and DOA at the box office, Soldier was one a huge run of mega budgeted flops Warner Bros released in 1997 & 1998. But the suprise is how good this by the numbers sci-fi actioner really is.

Kurt Russell gives one of his greatest performances as the emotionally stunted lead character. It's a true tour de force of cinematic acting-he hardly says a word, but his eyes, expression and body language surge through the screen.

Paul WS Anderson's direction is efficient and tight, it's more his approach to the the look and feel of the material that's the problem. David Webb People's script is terrific and you can't help but wonder what Ridley Scott or John McTiernan might have be able to do with this.

110993,2,0790740443,"I can't really bring myself to either like or dislike this movie entirely.  Another entry in the ""future troopers"" genre, it uses science fiction to explore the notion of a fierce, unstoppable, but ultimately disposable form of combat soldier.  Examples of this notion have ranged from the excellent (Blade Runner, Robocop and the Terminator) to the awful (Universal Soldiers).  This one's okay.

On first viewing, it reminds me of a larger-budget version of Enemy Mine, in which we get barely a glimpse of a war-torn future before the hero is dumped on a barely habitable planet, struggles for survival, and ends up in your basic action climax.  Like Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. in that movie, Kurt Russell gives a performance better than his material deserves -- which isn't saying much, since a lot of Soldier plays like it was written for Stallone at the height of his Rambo misanthropy.

The cast is generally good, particularly Russell's finely understated performance -- his character's lifelong conditioning has made him incapable of expressing emotion, or even speaking conversationally (he robotically addresses everyone but the enemy as ""sir""), yet he conveys enough in his body language to make more of his role than one might expect.

Another reviewer called this a sequel to Blade Runner and compared Russell's Sgt. Todd to BR's Deckard.  Without arguing too much, I'd modify that by saying it's more of a Blade Runner prequel (thematically, if not literally).  It's essentially the backstory of Blade Runner's Roy Batty, an enhanced combat soldier bred for offworld service but never regarded as truly human, who rebels against his shortsighted human masters and leads his followers to a prospective home on another world.  Of course, Todd's stoic efficiency bears little resemblance to Batty's charismatic dark angel persona, but they're flipsides of the same coin.  (The fact that both films were written by the same screenwriter becomes clear long before the credits roll -- listen for the ""Tanhauser Gate"" reference.)

Soldier isn't a great movie by any stretch.  If anything, it has the feel of a script written back in the 80's that had gathered dust on a shelf until someone felt like filming it.  Take it on that level, and it's watchable.  Not great, but good enough to pass a little time.",1165017600,,2321,5.05511811023622

110998,4,0790740443,"Soldier is a movie that bombed at the box office.  Made for a reported $75 million, it didn't make back a quarter of that.  Critics on [...] gave it a 2 percent consensus, which makes it one of the worst movies ever as fair as the critics were concerned.  I have to ask why?

Like most of the other people here on the ""Zon,"" the movie accomplished what it was looking to and did it believably.  There were no notable bad actors, overly bad scenes, the plot was thin, but fine for most action movies.  The only thing I can think of is that critics just don't get science fiction as well.  They more understand the hundredth review they do on a revenge theme, or a crime and punishment theme, or more character driven personalized type of saving my daughter type of action movie. Throw a spaceship in and they are lost!

In a lot of ways I thought soldier made a good point on how we handle our military today.  It should be observed that soldiers returning from long stints fighting terrorists, and then trying to re-enter society is going to have problems. It also may have shown some light on the often unthinking, unfeeling attitude you see with how the government treats its soldiers.

Despite the subtle politics, Soldier is a good action movie.  Much of the movie played out in a similar vein like movies such as Die Hard, and Rambo that fill the action venues.  Kirk Russell is convincing as a trained killing machine that no personal ambitions outside of doing his duty as a soldier and doing it well.  When asked to describe his thoughts, feelings, he answers ""Fear and Discipline, Sir.""

I'm a science fiction and an action movie fan.  I still doubt I would have committed so much money to a movie with nothing special to attract larger audiences.  This is a movie that should have been made a little more on the cheap.  When I saw the production values on TV, I wondered why I had never heard of this movie.

He's a man who was chosen at birth to be a ""Soldier"".  Soliders are trained to only speak when spoken to by an officer first, to show no emotion, no mercy, and follow orders with very little room for thinking.

Then a newer, genetically engineered soldier is introduced and the group that Todd fought with is demoted to go-fers for the 'real' soldiers.  Todd, who was used to test the ability of the 'new' models was injured, rendered unconscious and put out with a garbage run.

It's at this point that the movie really takes off.  Todd is helped by settlers who are where they shouldn't be.  He has no training in how to react among 'normal' people.  There are families here. You can see that he's trying to figure out the parameters of this new existence and if he hadn't been a sargent and allowed some degree of thinking for himself I don't know if Todd could have coped with these changed circumstances.  There's a lot to think about in this film.  What makes us who we are? If we are trained to act one way and punished for any deviation can we change our patterns of behavior as an adult.  What are the possibilities that people can change.  Whe are the monsters? The killers or those who send them out?

111002,4,0790740443,"""Soldier"" is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. A friend gave it to me - thanks, bud.

The movie starts out really strong. I found it to be pretty believable in the beginning. As it shows Todd progress from baby to ruthless soldier/killer, the progression is very interesting to watch. It is a strong part of the movie of which I wish we had seen more.

The middle of the movie comes to life quite well also. I enjoyed watching as Sgt. Todd interacted with regular people and tried to come to grips with being human. This is another really strong part of the movie, and I wish this part could have been extended a bit more, to have let us seen the soul of the man. Watching him trying to adjust into ""normal"" life is one of the best parts.

Ironically, the worst part about the movie about a soldier is when the movie requires him to start doing action scenes as a soldier. There was nothing wrong with Kurt Russell's performance at all, but the plot at this point started to seem very contrived.

I disliked the fact that they made the bad commander guy to be ""evil"" by having him make fun of the old troops, criticize the one new soldier for losing his eye, and other silly instances. That was not necessary. It was also not necessary to show that he is a coward by having him piss on himself.

I feel that the end of the movie would have been more effective had they shown the attacking troops attacking for a legitimate reason other than ""the enemy commander is evil and we need to give Sgt. Todd somebody to fight."" As I said, the whole fight sequence seemed contrived. It was interesting to watch, to be sure, but the story by that point was pretty darn weak and getting weaker and weaker.

Luckily the movie redeems itself at the very end, narrowly in time just before the credits come up. So it does have a good ending. But I just keep thinking to myself that this movie could have been more than what it was. It started out as an intense psychological sci-fi war movie and ended up as a cheap action flick. A little bit disappointing.

My favorite part in the movie is where Todd puts on the facial war paint and says, ""I'm going to kill them, sir."" You've got to love that part!

As others have mentioned, this movie tries to rely on story rather than special effects. I think it succeeds for the most part. The special effects are still quite good though. The junk scenery backgrounds were downright breathtaking. I was really impressed by those effects, and that doesn't happen often. Usually movies these days are so busy cramming effects down your throat, one after another, in such fast sequence that you never have time to appreciate them. (Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith immediately spring to mind). I like the style of this movie much better.

Kurt Russell's performance as Sgt. Todd is extremely effective. The minimalist approach works best here, and he does an outstanding job. The man still looks awesome in a flat-top. He's looked cool in one ever since Stargate. (That movie was the reason I tried to wear a flat-top, for a while. It seems my head is just not the right shape for such an animal :)

So the bottom line: this is a great movie. The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is that I feel like it could have been more. While the movie was good, the action portion of the story left me feeling a little unsatisfied. This may be the type of movie that would have done better if it had been written with less action and more of a character-driven story. But I've got no real complaints.

In writing, people say ""show, don't tell,"" meaning that it is better to describe a person's emotional state through actions (so-and-so clenched his fist and his jaw bunched tensely) rather than just saying it (so-and-so was angry).

Kurt Russell's perfomance took this to heart. Without hardly any words to ""tell"" his emotions, he conveyed them beautifully through subtle actions. I especially like that little head tilt at the end when he--to the astonishment of his fellow soldiers--picked up the little boy. Such a tiny motion, yet it said it all.

My favorite line - When Connie Neilson is panacking over the attacking bad guys.  She asks Sergeant Todd - ""What are you going to do?"" Todd replies in a matter of fact dead pan way ""I'm going to kill them all, sir!"".  To hear Russle deliver that line....sheer poetry.

The story line is good up until the battle scenes later in the move. Then the story falls apart. Lots of explosions and violence.  The elite younger soldiers suddenly forget how to be soldiers and fall easy prey to the older Sgt Todd(Russles Character).  The directing and editing seem a little sloppy.

He loses and finds himself dumped on a garbage waste planet and left for dead. The rest of the movie focuses on Russell's character slowly finding his human side again. When a group of unarmed inhabitants who took him in as one of their own then rejected him because he could not fit are threatened by the military, Russell steps up and the action is fast and enjoyable. The inhabitants have been targeted to test the killing efficiency of the military's new stronger, faster, deadlier group of elite killer soldiers.  This is more than just a bog standard sci-fi action film. It has a good heart at the centre of the story which makes you get behind Russell's character 100%.

111009,5,0790740443,"Unlike many sci-fi/action films, ""Soldier"" stays with you, because it touches the heart with a few poignant, memorable scenes, has an interesting script and character development, and though some of it is derivative and silly, the film has Soul.

Much of this is due to a superb performance by Kurt Russell, in the almost mute part of Todd 3465, who was bred and trained to kill, and whose only feelings and thoughts are of ""fear and discipline"".

Todd 3465 was born in 1996 for the Adam Project, and we see him at 38, replaced by a faster and more durable model of soldier. Todd, presumed dead, is dumped with the trash on Arcadia, a ""waste disposal planet"".

There are no big budget special effects, but the visuals and cinematography (by David Tattersall) are excellent, the direction by Paul Anderson is perfectly paced, and Joel McNeely's score, along with the atmospheric sound effects, add a lot to the film.

Sean Partwee and Connie Nielsen are good as the Arcadian couple who befriend Todd, Gary Busey puts in a fine turn as Todd's captain, and Jason Isaacs plays the bad guy with appropriate meanness.

There are some terrific mano-a-mano fight scenes between Russell and his ""replacement"" Caine 607, played well by Jason Scott Lee, who was marvelous in ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", and shows his martial arts expertise in this film as well.

The film is free of foul language except for one instance (and one has to wonder why they ruined a perfect score with it), and despite the violence, would make suitable family viewing, because the violence has purpose and meaning...there is nothing gratuitous in this film, which is another reason I appreciate it, and most of all, it has that rare thing in a Hollywood film, a satisfying ending...one that will bring a tear to your eyes.",1101772800,5,1793,4.786407766990291
111010,5,0790740443,"After seeing this film on TV a few times, I decided to go out to the video store and rent it.  To me, this is one of those films that really sticks with me for a long time.  I thought that Kurt Russell's portrayal as ""Todd"" (a super soldier selected and trained from birth) was very compelling.  Call me weird or crazy, but there is a certain fascination I have for characters who play these lonewolf/mysterious types.  These are the types of characters who give some people a creepy feeling down the back of their neck because their screen presence is so powerful and unusual.

The story line is mostly biographical.  A group of babies are specially selected at birth for a special operations unit.  These kids are indoctrinated as soldiers through 17 + years of brutal training.  At various stages in the training, those who do not make the cut are simply killed.  The story focuses on Todd.  After Todd fights various campaigns we meet him again at the age of 38 when a comanding officer questions his and his platoon's abilities compared to another platoon of super soldiers.  A contest is given where Todd and a number of men from his platoon square off against the ""new and improved"" soldiers.  Todd along with a few of his men are left for dead and dumped on a planet designated for garbage disposal.  Todd was the only one of his kind to survive.  This planet it turns out is inhabited.  The natives cautiously welcome him and help him for a while.  Eventually, they abandon him after deciding that he simply isn't a good fit for their community.  Later however, they find out that they've made a big mistake.

Although Todd was raised to be a soldier only, later in the film we see that he is making somewhat of a transition to being more compassionate and emotional.",1094515200,3,1776,4.548895899053628

Good acting (a bit stilted) but I like it.  Kurt Russell PLAYS the part of an emotionally empty soldier dumped into a society.

Negatives:

---------------------------

> Feels low budget.  The storyline is good but could have had a better and been a bit less bleak.  I don't mind dark but the visual feel of the movie was ""B movie""

If you are looking for amazing dialog look elsewhere, if you are looking for Kurt representing caged emotion you will find it.

In some ways this is a clich film, it has the ""one guy against overwhelming odds"" storyline.  I like the interaction and the ""healing process"" which includes him dealing with everyone else as ""sir"" and finally figuring out some don't deserve the title. I just love the concept of a conditioned ""pure"" soldier dropped out of his controlled environment, and gravitating to what is truly ""right"" (protecting innocents).

111012,4,0790740443,"Kurt Russell plays Sgt. Todd, #3465, among the first genetically engineered soldiers born and raised to fight.  After many years, decades even, of loyal and effective service, a new generation of soldier has been developed.  The new generation is stronger with faster reflexes.  Of course, in the world of movies there must be a drawback.  The drawback is that the new generation has too much arrogance, too little experience, and perhaps way too little common sense.

After a demonstration between the new soldiers, one which has little to do with fighting in the real world, Sgt. Todd is apparently dead and is dropped onto an uninhabited trash world; a huge open-air landfill for civilizations across the inhabited space of mankind.  However, Sgt. Todd quickly discovers that the trash world is not uninhabited.

A group of pioneers crashlanded on the planet on the way to another planet, and no one knows they are there.  Sgt. Todd has no reason to behave as a soldier towards these people; they do not threaten him and in fact welcome him to their homes.  Eventually they come to distrust his soldierly mein and boot him out of their settlement.

By a complete and bizarre coincidence, the new generation of genetically engineered soldiers has been sent to the trash planet to eradicate the squatters, who are somehow now armed and dangerous, at least so far as the soldiers have been told.  Of course, even though Sgt. Todd has been booted out of the settlement, he cares for these people and returns to defend them, showing that in actual combat experience and creativity will outweigh sheer strength as long as the odds are somewhat reasonable.

Kurt's character is a perfect blend of Spock and any action hero you care to name.  He kills only when necessary, and he has an incredible code of honor.  His code of honor extends only to those who act honorably, as we discover in the movie.

The movie is uncharacteristic in that is relies more on the development of Sgt. Todd's character than on special effects and action.  The suspense near the end is a bit overly dramatic in places, with more than a little hokum, but in the end the movie is effective and enjoyable.

I am a tremendous admirer of Jason Isaacs, who plays a sneering bully (Col. Mekum) in this movie.  His role is quite small, but he joins Paul Anderson on the director's commentary and reveals himself to be a man of unusual intelligence and wit.  Anderson and the producer, I think, get completely absorbed in self-congratulatory Fanboy minutiae, but I thought Isaacs was hysterically funny.  An unusual treat for that reason.",1077753600,4,700,4.620967741935484
111016,3,0790740443,"Kurt Russell as an action star? I know that sounds funny, but after you see this movie, you will believe it. I will admit, I thought this movie was going to bite it hard when it came out. I thought it looked cool, but it had ""rental"" written all over it. After seeing it years ago, I came away entertained. Which is all that really matters, if you think about it. Now that you can get it for a nice price, I would recommend checking it out.
Kurt Russell plays a bio-engineered soldier. He is chosen from birth and trained to kill. That is his only life he knows. He is shown gruesome violence as a young child. He is trained to have no mercy and no remorse. He is a killing machine made by some sort of government. They take children from birth and literally train them to become ruthless soldiers. When they get to their adult years, they are sent out on the battlefield. They are then the perfect soldiers. Of course, there are some downsides to this. They have no social skills. They have never had emotions toward other human beings. And this is where the movie seperates itself from being a 'B-movie'.
Over time, a new super-soldier is created. One that is literally made from the DNA up. This is where the conflict of the movie arises. Sgt. Todd's (Russell) squad is being replaced by a squad of advanced soldiers that are even better than Russell's. They are led by Caine (Jason Scott Lee). Lee plays a pretty decent villianous character. Even though he is just following orders. The orders are coming down from a higher ranking officer (played by Jason Isaacs). Isaacs seems to enjoy this role of playing the main villian. He never goes over the top, but he definately makes you not like him. Gary Busey actually plays a character that is NOT insane. He plays a general (or something) that is the head of the old soldiers. He is reluctant to switch over to the newer soldiers without them ever being tested in the field. Isaac's character overrules him.
So, Russell is dumped like trash onto some planet that has been 'abandoned' (or so they think), and it only used for waste disposal. Upon waking, he is found by a group of outlanders who are living on the plant. They have formed a sort of colony and live peacefully without interference. It is here that Sgt. Todd must learn some human emotion and traits to live with normal human beings. Of course the bad guys want to test out the new brand of soldiers. They send them on (what they think) is a routine ""sweep & clear"" mission. Little do they know that Sgt. Todd is still alive and is willing to show them a thing or two.
This is an action movie with some heart to it. I thought this was going to be a Rambo-type movie with Russell in the lead role. I was wrong. He defends his new friends and fights for their survival. Along the way, he learns what it's like to care for other people. One of these people is a woman (the insanely HOT Connie Nielson). Her husband was one of the first to befriend Todd. After his death, he takes it upon himself to protect her and her son.
I liked this movie quite a bit. It's kinda low budget and it is an action film. It's not going to win any awards, but it's way better than I thought it would be. I was surprised how big Kurt Russell got for this movie. He only has like 10-15 lines the whole flick and he plays the 'commando' character well. Honestly, I would not pay $20 for this movie, but for $10 it's a steal. It's a fun, yet simple action movie with a nice side of emotion. When I saw the trailer, I was wondering why the hell Russell would want to do a picture like this. After seeing it, I know why.
Not many special features here to speak of. You get a commentary, production notes, and a trailer. That's it. You can find the movie for around $6.99 now, so I guess I can't complain about the lack of supplements.",1074816000,6,3824,4.327298050139276
111017,4,0790740443,"Boy, I'm sure glad I watched this movie _before_ I found out I wasn't supposed to like it. I don't understand the disappointment; this is a well-made and satisfying movie.
I've said before that Kurt Russell is an extremely underrated actor, and he proves it again here. This is a demanding role.
Sgt. Todd is a genetically-engineered supersoldier, indoctrinated from birth as part of something called the 'Adam Project'. A seasoned combat veteran, Todd is a highly trained killing machine who has never known any other way of life.
Yet during the movie, we're supposed to gather that he's starting to feel some 'normal' human emotions and having trouble reconciling his past with his present. Somehow Todd has to put all this across to the audience with a bare minimum of dialogue and an absolutely flat-affect delivery -- rather like Arnold in the _Terminator_ films, with the difference that Todd is _not_ a cyborg or robot, but a human being with a deep inner life that he doesn't know how to express.
I don't know who could have played the part other than Russell. I can't think of another actor who could manage to convey so much with an expressionless face and _also_ be believable as a pumped-up supersoldier. (And Russell is seriously pumped up for this film.)
The story is well-crafted, too. Written by David Webb Peoples, one of the screenwriters on _Blade Runner_, this film is conceived as something of a sequel to that one and partakes of its darkness and moral ambiguity. But for all that, it zips along nicely under Paul Anderson's direction (despite some overuse of slo-mo).
Oh, there's some derivative stuff that we can charitably regard as 'homage' if we like. There's a very heavy nod toward _First Blood_ (and in general a strong evocation of the U.S.'s treatment of Vietnam veterans). And certainly this supersoldier thing has been done before (although _Universal Soldier_, _RoboCop_, and _The Six Million Dollar Man_ were cyborgs rather than genetically engineered Uebermenschen). That just means we're dealing with a very good B movie rather than something breathtakingly new.
Some viewers have suggested that Jason Scott Lee isn't very effectively used in this film. I disagree; I think he's downright fearsome in his single-minded lethality. (As you'll learn in the first few minutes of the film, he's one of a team of _super_-supersoldiers that are supposed to render Sgt. Todd and his guys obsolete.)
The SF backdrop is interesting and unforced although not terribly well fleshed out. All I can say without spoiling things is that there's a planet in the Arcadia sector that Earth is using as a junkyard, and that there's a human society living on it that nobody on Earth knows about.
The rest of the cast does well (including Michael Chiklis). Watch especially for a nice job by Gary Busey. You'll probably also like the Joel McNeely score, which doesn't break any new ground (and certainly doesn't hoist the film to the stratosphere as David Arnold's does _Stargate_) but nevertheless does its job adequately.
Oh -- and don't forget to be awed by the hauntingly gorgeous piece of music in Scene 11. It's 'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' by Loreena McKennitt and it's on her CD _The Book of Secrets_.",1073088000,8,3229,4.926605504587156

This movie REALLY could have been mind-blowing had it not been held back by Anderson's chronic lack of any imagination (see my other reviews of Paul Anderson's work).  If this material was being molded by ANYBODY with any sense of vision or especially scope, this movie might have been as popular as the Matrix is now.  'Soldier' was CRYING to be done on a grand scale.  How cool would it have been to have seen a huge 'Saving Private Ryan' meets 'Attack of the Clones'-type battle scene?  Instead we get work that looks like it was done in a high school auditorium.
Look at things like the horribly dull set designs (not bad per se, but just no creativity), the poor lighting, the stereotyped lemming-civilian characters, and the clichd villains.  It's awful how phoned-in this movie just seemed.
The tragic part is that Kurt Russell was terrific in it and was just surrounded by people (actors and production crew alike) that just had no interest (or maybe ability) in trying to add flavor to the VAST RESOURCES they had at their disposal.
I actually cringe when I think about just how cool this could have been compared to the body of work that everyone seemed content to turn in.",1067558400,13,1454,4.616279069767442

111021,4,0790740443,"Written as sort of a sequel to Blade Runner (it takes place within the same universe) by David Peeples (Unforgiven, Blade Runner), Soldier is a rarity now days; it's a B-Movie masquerading as an A movie. I said it was a rarity because it also doesn't have any pretentions to be anything but that. Kurt Russell plays a man born and bred to be a ruthless, brutal soldier. When he's injured, he's discarded like yesterday's news on a planet where much of Earth's waste is dumped. When the latest genetically enhanced soldiers arrive to dispose of the inhabitants of the planet, Russell's character is pushed into action; he's discovered the barest hints of humanity and compassion that was always denied him before. He's taken to these underdogs and they to him almost as a family.

In many respects the plot for Solider could have been lifted from a Clint Eastwood Western. Here's The Man With No Name suddenly discovering an emotional core he never knew he had. He helps the less fortunate not because of pity but because he realizes he finally belongs. Russell's performance is masterful. While the Russell doesn't have much dialog, he manages to convey what makes the character tick with  minimum discussion. Russell uses body language to communicate as much as the dialog. In many respects, he's a variation on the character of Rick Deckard from Blade Runner. He's a man of action that ceases to exist between assignments. This cypher like character suddenly discovers he is more than his past and his actions. In the process he rediscovers his own humanity. Soldier makes a complimentary piece to the Mad Max series.

The film uses the action and science fiction genre for a springboard to examine a lot of different themes and issues but, make no mistake, it is still an ACTION film. The stunts are well choregraphed and the visual effects effective but it isn't drenched in the CGI we've come to expect movies of this type to have.

The DVD transfer is very good as is the audio quality. The extras includes commentary by director Paul W. S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil), a theatrical trailer, production notes and both the wide and full screen editions of the movie. My only complaint is the fact that writer David Peeples isn't given any room for a commentary track. Since he's truly the author of the film (and it was intended as a sequel of sorts or companion piece to Blade Runner), it would have been very interesting to get his take on the finished product.

Solider isn't Citizen Kane nor does it pretend to be; it's like many of the classic B-Movies of the 50's to the 80's (most notably The Terminator)in that there's far more than meets the eye going on here.",1062374400,22,2686,4.730769230769231

111026,5,0790740443,"This is one of the great, unsung science fiction films of recent times. The story revolves around a future where soldiers are segregated and trained from the crib to be merciless, killing machines. Kurt Russel, in a great performance, plays one of these soldiers who are soon to be replaced by a genetically enhanced new breed of soldier. Sgt. Todd 3465 (Russel) is believed killed in a training exercise and disposed of like yesterday's garbage on a waste-disposal planet. He survives, finds refuge amongst a colony of planet refugees, and tries to fit in.
This is, on a very rewarding level, a tremendous action film. Russel's nemesis in the film, Sgt. Caine 607 (played by Jason Scott Lee) is an imposing presence, and the fight scenes between the two are excellent and convincing. The special effects and battle scenes are impressive as well, and really transport you to a harsh, bleak, metallic future.
On another level the film is about the discovery of emotion in the highly trained soldier as he tries to fit into a more normal society. Russel is simply outstanding in the roll, doing an incredible acting job. He speaks a total of about 20 words in the whole film, but his internal struggles are always clear and very moving.
This ""learning human emotions"" trick is one several science fiction films have attempted, and most are embarrassing and painful to watch, dripping with sugar and sap. ""Soldier"" excels in this department as Russel makes the shift from killing machine to feeling man in a subtle, believable way. The film is just very, very well done and well written. The acting is fine all the way around, and the dialogue is completely absent of those wince-producing moments films of this nature often have.
Over time, this has become one of my favorite movies. I have watched it several times with increased enjoyment each time.

SOLDIER is very good praxeological (""soft"") speculative fiction in that it employs thoughtful extrapolation of sociological and psychological trends to establish the premises upon which it is based. What's more, anyone who decries Kurt Russell's work in this film betrays an ignorance of acting and a lack of good taste that fits the silly booger perfectly for a career as a newspaper movie critic. More punishing insult I cannot possibly offer.
The problem with this movie is that there are aspects of the production that beat the living hell out of us ""hard"" science fiction fen. Back in 1969, in his essay ""Science Fiction: its nature, faults and virtues"" (*The Science Fiction Novel*), Robert A. Heinlein made the following comment on the genre:
""A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method.
""To make this definition cover all science fiction (instead of 'almost all') it is necessary only to strike out the word 'future.'""
In 1981, Heinlein followed up in ""Ray Guns and Space Ships"" (*Expanded Universe*) with:
""Science Fiction is speculative fiction in which the author takes as his first postulate the real world as we know it, including all established facts and natural laws. The result can be extremely fantastic in content, but it is not fantasy; it is legitimate -- and often very tightly reasoned -- speculation about the possibilities of the real world. This category excludes rocket ships that make U-turns, serpent men of Neptune that lust after human maidens, and stories by authors who flunked their Boy Scout merit badge tests in descriptive astronomy.""
And that last particularly sums up the true science fiction fan's problems with SOLDIER. Posit a spacegoing civilization and tell me, please, that they would ever bother going through the expense (economic as well as thermodynamic) and bother of hauling refined metal and other salvagable scrap materials out of one gravity well and then carelessly dumping the stuff on the surface of a planet somewhere else (i.e., at the bottom of yet *ANOTHER* gravity well). Even if they were planning future colonization of that windy mudball, anyone but a mundane (or a dimwitted fan of ""soft"" sci-fi) would know that all that junk could be more efficiently and cost-effectively used in a microgravity environment (in other words: up in orbit) as raw materials for any contemplated new manufactures. Once you've achieved the technology necessary for spaceflight, it's simply easier and less costly to make most rough and finished goods in space than on a planetary surface. That's true today, and cannot be otherwise in the future.
The whole of this idiocy is summed up by the director's use of a particularly gormless background image: a bloody great aircraft carrier flopped over on its port side (apparently the *USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt* -- like you couldn't set the damned thing down on its keel?) with the island superstructure sticking up at a 45-degree angle. Yeesh.
SOLDIER is an entertaining movie, and I extoll Kurt Russell's work in this film. He is generally quite horribly underappreciated as an actor, and his professionalism -- here as elsewhere -- is beyond reproach. This having been said, would it have killed the silly sonsabitches responsible for the production values in SOLDIER to have gotten input from some people who understand ""established facts and natural laws"" and who aren't (like writer David Webb Peoples, director Paul W.S. Anderson, and production designer David L. Sawyer) total and absolute mundane cement-heads?

Note: One of the earlier reviewers mentioned that SOLDIER is set in the same plenum as the inappropriately-titled 1982 movie BLADE RUNNER (drawn, like so many of the past two decades' ghodawful dimwitted ""skiffy"" flicks, from the work of hack SF writer Philip K. Dick [1928-1982], who is the unspeakably mundane Modern Language Association's present-day darling, his signal claim to fame being a Hugo Award given for THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE [1963], and who has been for the most part largely -- and rightfully -- ignored by hard science fiction fen). The reviewer's surmise is incorrect, as there are also in-joke references to a bunch of other sci-fi movies, including Russell's own ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and the Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN.",1036627200,5,4517,5.145578231292517

This is the kind of movie, acting, and directing that gives sci-fi a bad name outside a few franchises, and ensures we don't get much in the way of original movies.  Kurt Russell packs wide-eyed looks into the camera as a substitute for acting; the director uses generic music and sudden and *dramatic* slow-motion shots to add 'feeling' to the movie.  The world is eternally dark and gloomy, only lit by the constant over-bright fires.
Kurt Russell is too big a name for this movie, and none of the other parts are done any justice by the terrible acting.

I agree with some of the other reviews that Kurt does a remarkable job portraying his role without ever saying much at all, that was on purpose - a part of the character.  It has one of the all-time great lines when confronted with the fact he was wildly outnumbered and asked what he was going to do.

He says 80 words (not certain on that, but I counted them once!) but packs more into his performance than any of today's more acclaimed ""actors"". I've never seen an actor express so effectively with their eyes. So often I see a close up these days and either am not sure what emotion they are trying to show, or I know exactly what they are trying to display but can't help notice how poorly they are showing it.
Maybe part of it comes from the character, I'll admit. His emotions are buried due to his lifelong training, but he's seen some things that have tremendous emotional impact, so you are expecting there's something deep inside that wants to get out. And then Kurt shows it, and very effectively.
In summary, this is my favorite of the highly specific Terminator/Robocop/Ultimate Soldier sub-genre, and ends up being one of my very favorite action movies.",1022112000,15,1086,4.603092783505154
111035,4,0790740443,"Kurt Russell barely says a hundred words in Soldier. There are no catchy one-liners to diminish his performance; he says only what is necessary and it always ends with 'Sir!'. Soldier is a cruel extrapolation of the the military's destruction of individuality. Here, soldiers are as disposable as tissues when something better comes along.
Russell's performance in this movie is endlessly fascinating! His face and body language express more than any dialogue could, allowing the viewer to take as much emotional depth as he or she would have. It is interesting to find that as one tunes into this near-silent performance, one can find much more depth in the performances of the other actors in the film. If you don't want to delve into the emotional avenues of this film there are some great action sequences to keep the pace moving, including a fight with our hero and our antagonist high up on chains!
The violence here is graphic. Not many punches are pulled by the director, although the commentary makes it clear that he did not go as far as he wanted.  The violence is not gratuitous though. To understand our hero we must see where he came from, and that is a cold and fearsome place.
I wish there were more extra features in this DVD. It only comes with a trailer and a commentary. The guys are interesting though, balancing technical aspects of the film with little bits about the actors and what they all went through during filming.

111037,3,0790740443,"Yes, the plot of this movie is incredibly contrived, almost absurdly so. However, the premise of the film is quite interesting. Right around present day, a top-secret government firm recruits (or should I say kidnaps?) male orphans and boys w/out any familial ties in order to mold them into perfect soldiers. The training is ruthless and the weaklings are weeded out; if you can't cut the mustard, you get whacked. In some ways, this reminds me of the regimen instituted by the Spartans of ancient Greece where boys underwent brutal instruction in the art of war between the ages of 7-20.

The movie then skips ahead 40 some odd years into the future. By this time, a new breed (literally) of warriors comes to the fore to replace the old school soldiers. This new class of warriors are genetically engineered to be military men. They endanger the old class of becoming obsolete.
There is then a competition between a champion of the old guard (Kurt Russell) vs a member of the new (Jason Scott Lee). The talents of Russell, Lee and Gary Busey are all a bit wasted in this movie, but it's nice to see bona-fide actors in an action movie. Indeed, having these 3 perform in a marginal movie like this is like hiring the Morman Tabernacle choir to sing ""Happy Birthday.""
This is not a great movie, by any stretch of the imagination. However, it is entertaining and boasts top-notch acting. The special effects and sets on the junk-yard-world are quite impressive, too. So, if you're looking for a solid action movie w/out a great plot to round out your action movie collection, this might just be for you. If you demand an exceptional plot from any and every movie you see, I would recommend that you pass this one by.",1008460800,4,1716,4.644736842105263
111038,5,0790740443,"I applaud the writer, director and star of Soldier - great work!
The story brought in some interesting concepts - something to think about.  Soldiers trained from birth - a life of incessant training and combat.  It makes you ask yourself questions.  How far off is this from the athletes from the primarily former Eastern Bloc who's life was geared around Olympic competition?  How far off is making newborns wards of the State and inducting them into this kind of life?  The story also asked the question: What does someone who has known nothing but military training and combat think and feel?  It's really something else.  Another thing that I was pleased to see was the triumph of Man over Technology.  While the new Soldiers are genetically superior to Dodd and his men, they lack the intuition, creativity, and combat experience that the ""old ones"" have.
The director's influence on the story was obvious in the use of story/plot over special effects (though they did exist).  Use of the camera was expert in such scenes as Dodd's flashback as he is using the large metal can as a punching bag - it comes as no surprise that out of instinct and pure reaction that he attacks the man who suddenly comes into the room.  Excellent setting of mood and building of suspense.
Kurt Russell himself plays an excellent character.  He pulls off alot of combinations that other actors may very well have shyed away from.  For example, he definitely put on some muscle for this film, but at the same time this hulking and scarred Soldier is at times terrified, compassionate, and paternal...all the while not coming out of the hardened state of the character. Bravo.
All in all, the untrained eye may see this as a low-budget sci-fi film (again, few special effects - sometimes the primary judging factor of a sci-fi film, sadly).  I, however, see this film as making a statement and showing off the style and skill of all involved.",1008115200,12,1927,4.733532934131737

I really don't see how anyone could not love this movie, especially since it also stars Garey Busey AND the Commish (who knows his real name?).

111041,5,0790740443,"Soldier is a rare experience that is far more than the plot, which has been outlined by the editorial comments.  This is a journey taken by a strong warrior into his own humanity.  I cannot even count the number of times that I have watched this movie, but I know it is more than twenty.  I see more each time.
Kurt Russell's extraordinary and powerful acting skills make Sergeant Todd real.  Successfully creating a character without dialogue is an art -- and he mastered it.  This movie provides insight into today's violent world as well.
Todd has known nothing but war or training since he was born.  He was conscripted in the hospital; he never knew love, or laughter, or how to play.  He obeyed orders and did not speak unless spoken to.  The perfect soldier could not have emotions.  If the only way to kill an enemy was to kill innocent victims, then he did what was required.
Todd is the best soldier of the ""old timers,"" and he has been bested a new, genetically engineered soldier.  One of the most poignant scenes is on the world where he was dumped for dead.  The survivors that created a life on Arcadia are nervous to have a soldier in their midst, and ask Todd why he is there alone.  He stands, no expression on his faces, and says, ""I was replaced by a better soldier, Sir.""
Although he acknowledges that he is no longer good enough to be a soldier, as his body heals he works to grow stronger and returns to the training rituals that have ruled his entire life.  As he sees the interaction in the group that saved him, he is conflicted by emotions that he never experienced.  When asked what he thought about, he says, ""Fear.  Fear and training.""
It is extremely painful for him to be exiled from these people because he is too strong, and his violent training is too dangerous.  He does not understand what he feels.  This is my favorite scene.  He is alone in his exile, sitting in a concrete drainpipe with tears running down his face.  He wipes the tears away, and with the skill of a great actor, Russell shows that he does not even know what they are.
The arrogant commander of the new soldiers considers Arcadia the perfect first ""war.""  Anyone on the planet was considered hostile.  Three soldiers attacked the small group, killing without provocation.  They have no hope until Todd returns and saves the group.  When he is asked what he would do, he says,  ""Kill them all, Sir.""  He will not let the group help him because ""A soldier deserves a soldier.""
Good writing means that the hero must have an enemy equal to his abilities, and this has great writing.  In facing the final soldier, Todd's intelligence wins the battle.
I am passionate about this movie.  The acting, plot, special effects, and depth earn five stars.

111042,3,0790740443,"I remember this movie. I don't think it topped the 30 million mark for domestic gross. I though that was unfair. Marketing had to do with it more than anything. The movie is not great but it isn't bad either. Sure it has some cheesy moments and some ridiculous dialogue. Very stupid at times too.
Well let's get on with the review. Special FX: This is where it shines and also has problems. The quality of the FX fluctuate. Some scenes are so well done. The sets are on the whole beautiful, the wind scenes are done as good as they can be. It's the several moments that just cut right into the big picture. (any space scene with a spaceship, or any scene with a moving projectile) The matte painting, sets are very well done but some scenes just look too fake.
Plot: Okay so what do you expect from an action flick. Plot will rarely score points. It is the predictability and cliches that actually take this movie down. You can guess every twist and turn. At least you won't be surprised.
Acting: Again in an action flick this takes a back seat. There isn't any acting that stands out to be ""BAD"". And you are not going to expect any ""GREAT"" acting either. Kurt russell doesn't speak much. It isn't his fault. It's the character.
ETC aspects: I really don't have anything else to pick on except the unnecessary gore at times.
Okay final verdict. This is a viewable movie. I guess I wouldn't buy it because you would be able to watch it 3 times max. Bet renting it won't be too bad. 3.5 stars. Again I think it should have earned at least 40million domestic. Too bad it just collapsed. It wasn't THAT bad.

The opening 15 minutes of Soldier are great; true action at its best. The story follows Sgt. Todd's (Kurt Russel) introduction to the program from birth and takes us all the way up to present day. However, what would a movie be without a conflict?? Enter Michael Chicklis who plays the evil commander of a new, more advanced breed of soldier. You guessed it, Sgt. Todd is obsolete, and has been replaced. But Todd will not go down without a fight and of course seeks his revenge. Here's where Soldier falls short. Todd is taken to a waste disposal planet and left for dead. He is taken in by a tribe of nomads who make their home on the desolate planet. The middle hour of this movie, where Todd lives with the nomads is just plain boring. You might as well fast forward to the end, where Todd confronts his evil commander once and for all. This is a great movie for a night when you aren't in the mood for anything to heavy. Pure action, blood, guts and lots of shooting make it an above average adventure flick.

111047,3,0790740443,"In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and  designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government.  They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other  than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name  and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever.  This is the fate of those whose  destiny is predetermined for them in ""Soldier,"" directed by Paul Anderson  and starring Kurt Russell.  The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie  begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods  of time, from  preadolescence to adulthood.  Russell is Sergeant Todd, the  best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in  an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to  be, a soldier.  But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives  when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite.  A new generation of  soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology,  and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete.  What follows is the story of a  man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense  of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only  two things his entire life:  Fear and discipline.  Russell gives a  commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey  orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual  thoughts.  He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with  his eyes.  This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the  under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely  into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part  he has created someone quite different from any he's done before.  And he's  given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could  easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial  stereotype.  Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen  (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum).  Rounding out the supporting  cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation  of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael  Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick).  Anderson has  delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends  the genre of science-fiction.  ""Soldier"" reminds us of the importance of  keeping the humanity of our lives intact.  It's an entertaining way of  making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in  which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.

For me, at least, it worked.  His  character, Todd, speaks only when absolutely necessary, which isn't too  often, and lets his actions, eyes, and body speak for him for the rest of  the film. As far as I'm concerned, this is done well, and is very realistic  considering the upbringing his character has in the military where you only  speak when spoken to.
As for the rest of the movie, I found myself  enjoying it immmensely.  The slow transfomation of Todd's character,  beginning to learn how to live with other people, how to interact with  them, and his own inner struggle with the first stirrings of lust, not  knowing what it is, or how to actually deal with it.  And by the time the  last act of the movie was playing, where he had to defend the people he had  been getting to know, I was well into the movie and ready to go with the  flow, and let the action stand for itself.

They should stick to something like ""Sesame  Street"" where everything is labouriously explained in explicit detail  so they do not have to make an effort to delve deeper than just a  superficial level. Soldier is more than just an action film . It studies a  character who has been subject to heinous brutality and inhumanity as a  child and how being brainwashed and further subject to the horrors of war  as an adult have created a perfect soldier  , but a terrifying human  being. How could Sergeant Todd be anything other than a robotic killing  machine after suffering through all of that .Then the realisation that he  is obsolete is another crushing blow as that is an awful thing for anyone  to discover . He is beaten , left for dead and then disposed of on a  garbage world like he was nothing . Luckily he is taken in by the planets  inhabitants but life with them is trying though Todd slowly starts to  regain his humanity and gain a new sense of values which differ to what the  army has taught him . But he is soon rejected by the people as he does not  fit in and banished from the colony . The scene where Todd is alone in that  big pipe and sheds a tear is one of the saddest moments as he has once  again been discarded , it almost got me misty-eyed , almost. Todd's  interaction with the family he stays with is great as we get to see how a  person who has never known any affection or adoration copes with the  kindness and affections of the wife and son especially . Through the first  part of the film we feel both scared and in awe of what Todd is , then as  he is forced to cope in a new environment we feel a sense of pity for Todd  and what he was forced to become .  This is an epic film filmed with great  acting , characterisation , special effects and top notch action . I love  the ending with the 1-vs-17 battle with plenty of chance to cheer for the  hero . The line ""soldiers deserve soldiers"" shows that Todd as a  soldier follows a code which may be brutal but at least he knows that is  opponents are only doing as their told as they too have been bred to act  without free will .

Kurt Russell delivers yet another  exemplary-but-unacclaimed performance.  His Sgt. Todd is an Everyman who  does his duty, no questions, and is tossed out with the rest of the garbage  when the next new thing comes along. From that point, Russell's facial  expressions combine with the sensuous camerawork of the cinematographer to  provoke the questions:  Do I deserve love, beauty, and community? and:  When, if ever, is violence necessary?This is a flick I'd recommend to the  content guardians who are knee-jerk haters of violence.  Soldier uses  violence appropriately, intelligently.  It is a film for grown-ups.  Then  again, censors rarely get that point. Bottom line:  When you watch this  film, you have to watch everything that is going on.  It's not just another  action flick.",959472000,33,958,5.184210526315789
111053,2,0790740443,"Well, the previous reviewer,I categorically disagree with you: if actions speak louder than words, let's make a mute movie! True, there are moments in the movie (in its first half), when Soldier's terse behaviour arises  pity in the viewer, for this is the man robbed of normal human behaviour,  who can't even name the feelings that rack him. And curse the ones that  created him such. However, when they pictured a flashback into the past  when Soldier kills a child, my sympathy evaporated for good, and no other  cheezy scenes of him saving and holding children could not save him.
To  make things even worse, when the ""bad gyus"" landed on the planet,  I went to ""fast forward"": guess who smashed and routed two dozens  of ""death machines"", regained support of his demoted comrades and  blasted the whole planet with a nuclear bomb without uttering five words in  a row? If it comes to that, I'd better watch an old copy of Rambo...",959212800,2,936,4.6871165644171775
111054,4,0790740443,"A very promising idea is not fully realized in Soldier. It opens exceptionaly and is looking extremely promising, but then Kurt Russel lands on the trash planet and he starts becoming more human, which takes far too long. Russels charactor Todd speaks less than his Snake Plissken charactor  and he is pretty uninteresting. But then in the Last Half-hour Action takes  over and there is a full-on violent on-slaught which makes you forget all  the films flaws. Acting is credible and the set designs are great. Paul  Anderson has proved with Soldier and Event Horizen that he knows what he is  doing when it comes to Sci-Fi. All around.. It's no classic, but the last  half hour is reason enough to buy it.  Plus.. It has Kurt Russel.",956361600,2,734,4.6875
111055,2,0790740443,"Soldier has many things going for it which mainly include great special effects, set designs, and talented actors like Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, and Sean Pertwee.  What it doesn't have is a good plot, script,  execution, or even action for that matter.  The fact is I could have taken  the unoriginal plot if only the film maintained some form of excitement or  tension.
The film does start out promisingly enough with am montage of  Sergeant Todd's (Kurt Russell) life which involves grueling training and  numerous wars (The batte scenes in the montage are fairly unintentionally  humorous since when do soldiers just walk around and fire blindly).  Then  comes the introduction of a new batch of supersoldiers that have come to  replace Todd and his men.  The action sequence that has Russell and two  others fighting Jason Scott Lee on chains high above the ground is an good  one.  It's too bad none of the other ones could measure up to that one.  It's just that I never have found Rambo-type action to be generally good.  It's never suspenseful to watch the hero take down all the badguys with a  lot of ease.
Soldier might actually have been better if it didn't take  itself that seriously.  As a matter of fact, if it had also tried to be  humorous it would have been more enjoyable.  In most movies, we tend to  root for heroes because they're charismatic and likeable.  Russell's Todd  is somewhat likeable but there's no charisma.  Every single supporting  actor that receives billing has more dialogue than he does.  The whole  supersoldier plot idea has been used to death and it's done again poorly in  this weak action film.",956275200,3,1645,4.750889679715303
111056,4,0790740443,"Kurt Russell is a test tube bred soldier, taught from birth the discipline and destruction that a perfect human soldier requires, that is until technology improves and he becomes obsolete. A well-shot film with maybe  not the most intricate plot-line but one which definitely entertains.  I  can't give too much away, it does have large explosions and little speech  but nonetheless communicates very well by pictures alone.  Not only an  action film, it manages to encourage feelings of compassion and sorrow for  he who was a killing machine, due to all the things he was robbed of.  Definitely more than meets the eye and well worth buying on dvd.",955324800,4,650,4.89908256880734

This film was horrendously bad, trotting out all the scifi and action movie clichs,  without adding anything to them. Russell's macho posing can't hide the  utter lack of thought that goes into his character. This movie was made on  a shoestring to take advantage of people (like me) who are stupid enough to  see anything that smacks of scifi and action. No more.",953424000,2,498,4.689655172413793
111058,3,0790740443,"I've seen a million straight to video sci fi flicks.  The only difference between those and Soldier is bigger explosions and an excellent performance by Kurt Russell.  Russell is Sergeant Todd, trained from birth to be the  ultimate soldier, who becomes obsolete with the introduction of a new breed  of bio-enhanced soldier.  In a test of abilities, Russell is defeated by  Jason Scott Lee (who's been better) and dumped on a garbage planet where he  finds a small community of families fending off intense sudden bursts of  winds.  Russell is very good as an incredibly disciplined soldier who's  understanding of human emotion is non-existant.  Throughout the course of  the movie, he begins to understand the sensitivities of normal people, but  the community leaders decide he poses too much of a threat through his  warrior ways to live with them.  No sooner does this happen, then the  community is raided by the military, bio-enhanced soldiers included.  So  it's up to Russell to protect the people relying on his tried and true  combat savvy.  The explosions are bigger than in other sci-fi flicks, and  Russell's buff physique certainly fits the role, but overall, just a less  bland than most B-movie, with an A performance from Russell.  As a matter  of fact, he's why I give the movie three stars instead of 2.",952300800,3,1324,4.913636363636364
111059,4,0790740443,"This is quite a good Science-Fiction warfare story. The only thing that is lacking is the cast. Kurt Russel does a good job as an emotionally retarded professionel soldier who discovers that he can feel something after all and  Garey Busey amakes a fine officer with a total lack of perception, but the  band of Galactic refugees that becomes the target of a groop experimental,  genetically enhanced warriors is pityful at best. In the end I sort of  wished that the soldiers had managed to wipe them out. It wouldn't have  been a great loss. Still this is a fast-paced, action-packed movie with  great special effects. Relatively short by today's standards it prefents  the sense of Deja vu, that movies like True Lies and Speed gave me, when  the last fifteen minutes where not much more then a repeat performance of  the rest of the movie. Soldier has a nicely balanced plot, that ends when  there is nothing more to say. What I liked especially is that Russel never  makes a moral judgement. In most stories a reformed killer suddenly becomes  a moral philosofer condemning everybody who swaps a musquito. Not Russel's  Sergeant Todd. Even in the end, when his enemies are busy exterminating a  group of civilians Todd defends their actions, saying that they have to  obey orders, likes he used to do. This far more realistic, considering his  upbringing, then expecting him to suddenly turn pacifist. That he manages,  despite this escential coldblooded attitude to convey a sense of emotion  for the people he is protecting is a great tribute to Russel's acting  ability. On the whole, a great movie to watch and a lot more interesting  then Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, which is half again as long, but has a  lot less to tell the audience.",950572800,2,1750,4.805369127516778

He is thought to be killed and takin' to a trash  disposal planet. There he awakens and meets a group of rebels living on the  planet. They take him in where the solider gets in touch with himself and  starts becoming human. But a team of better soliders comes to the planet to  kill of the peolple on the planet.

Dont ask me why they thought that having Kurt Russel practically mute and  socially completely retarded would make the movie more entertaining. I  would have thought it would have been cool if he learned how to get along  with everyone and actually start to speak at one point, but I was let down  cause this never happened.

First there is the obvious--and if you can not see any deeper than this, you will not enjoy the movie--:The obvious is the action-oriented story and cinematography. Good in its own  right, but not great. What makes this movie great is the almost invisible  underlayered theme. The little boy at the beginning of the movie is still  very much present in Kurt Russell's character as he grows and becomes a  man. And even at the end, look into Russell's eyes, and the child within is  still there. To me, this movie is really about how bad things affect people  from the time they are children. And the main thrust of the movie seems to  be that we are all still children, no matter how old we are.",943833600,7,731,4.451127819548872
111067,4,0790740443,"The main attraction for buying the DVD is that given the low price one gets some very interesting added features, namely the audio commentary by the director and producer. Ultimately this is their film and it succeeds or  fails due to their influences. One of the great drawbacks is that the lead  character has very little dialogue with which to convey some complex  psychological issues. If not for the competent performance of Kurt Russell  as Sgt Todd (and the physical charms of Connie Nielsen) the film would fall  flat on its face. Notwithstanding, the action, special effects and  cinematography are sufficiently admirable to keep the sci-fi buffs  entertained. The movie begins on a good premise although I would question  the wisdom of placing the setting in the contemporary period when a more  futuristic treatment would seem more likely. But by far the greatest  deficiency originates with the lacklustre script, which is hard to  understand given thefact that the same pen which inked this mess wrote  Blade Runner. At some point it should have been realized that for the  audince to make a sypathetic connection with Sgt Todd he would have to  undergo an emotive transformation from a heartless killer. That aspect is  never successfully explored. Even Jason Isaacs declares on the audio  commentary that at times one screams out for Sgt Todd to say something but  he never progresses beyond the monosyllabic. One problem with the scenario  is that it seems pieced together from movie classics. The beginning evokes  memories of Conan the Barbarian then proceeds to emulate Shane while the  ending is clearly purloined from Rambo. There is no great shame in  modifying the works of others to suit ones own purpose, after all James  Cameron has become ""King of the World"" by utilizing this  approach. There is no forgiveness however for a poor script, especially  given the writer's credentials. I would have given this film three stars  out of five but due to the harshness of some previous reviews I have tried  to make ammends. With a slightly different treatment this movie could have  been a classic instead of standard fare.

Also because of  the involvement of David Peoples keep an eye out for some hidden Blade  Runner stuff, like a busted spinner laying in a trash heap, or the phrase  ""Tanhauser Gate"" tattoo'd on Todd's arm...just for that alone it  should be a favorite movie of any sci-fi fan.",940982400,2,632,4.491228070175438

There  he learns what it means to have selfish values and to love a woman.  When  the totalitarians return to threaten her, only Todd can destroy them.

The pretext of this movie is that 'soldiers', particularly American Soldiers, as they are the only  ones seen in this film committing one mindless atrocity after another, at  their core are mindless automatons that can be ordered to do anything and  will follow through gladly. The inference seems to be that this is the kind  of fighting men that we are heading for, if we don't already have them.  ""The Seven Samurai"" had it right.  Warriors are the ones  complained about, insulted, critisized when there is no danger, but when  the alarm sounds, or there's a dirty job to do, they are the ones that you  run to.

In a way, it's too bad, since Russell is a very accomplished actor.  To his credit, he let his expressions speak for him, and at times his  expressions were quite poignant.  I wished, however, that the film would  have concentrated more on the `soldier's' tribulations as a child growing  up through the system of training.  It could have been quite fascinating.  More time could also have been spent with the castaways after he was dumped  unceremoniously with all the other garbage.  It would have heightened the  emotion of the film when he was subsequently cast aside by the villagers  because he couldn't fit in.  But alas, Hollywood chose the easy way out,  touching only lightly in these areas and concentrated mainly on the  action...and as an action film, it wasn't bad at all, but it could have  been so much more.
