6307065,4,B00IZHPO74,"Heaven's Lost Property, forerunner? There may not be another season to this anime though it really is impossible to say for sure here in the States, but it still ends better and has a better story overall, (though not as funny, which seems to be intentional) than the HLP series. HLP was much funnier, but this series takes an only slightly more serious turn. If you liked, HLP, Please Teacher!, or Maharomatic, you will like this, maybe even more than any of those. It did not crash me like Maharomatic, and I was not left hanging as much as HLP, and it was not as final as Please,. I don't think I spoiled anything there. It really is all of those shows and none of them. I watched this on the net with the intention of finding out if I wanted to buy it and could not stop until I finished it. My copy is coming from Right Stuf, so I may add a disc review if I am disappointed with that or the packaging, or I may not. I like to write my reviews as I see fit. Feel free to complain. I could use a good laugh.",1428192000,2,1010,4.080402010050252

6307068,4,B00IZHPO74,"Grabby, beautiful alien girl moves in with single guy --> Guy aint having it at first --> Other alien girls show up --> Hijinx ensue... It's probably the single most frequently-used plot in all of anime, even surpassing the spiky-haired kid with a big appetite wants to be strongest / best in the world clich. Dears follows that cute invader formula to the letter, so does it have anything to offer anime fans who have watched this song and dance before? What about newer, less jaded viewers? Well Id answer yes on both accounts. Dears is legitimately fun and funny.

Dears is one of those series that you have to give props to not because it does anything revolutionary, but because it is so successful in accomplishing what it sets out to do and be. Its your standard mid-2000s harem comedy, with all that entails: adequate but not flashy level of animation, plenty of fanservice, and raunchy humor. What sets Dears apart and makes it better than many of its competitors is its spot-on comedic timing, often thoughtful writing, and the way it pushes the envelope of some of its racier ideas.

The English dub track for Dears is *excellent*, and the English actors do a fantastic job of bringing a likeable cast to life. Rin is a delightfully sweet dunce, Miu is a Type-A perfectionist who nonetheless turns out very likeable, and their nymphomaniac teacher is probably the most enthusiastic female sexual predator to ever disgrace the teaching profession. The comedy style is not-so-innocent and knowing in a way that subtly pokes the fourth wall at times. It also explores taboo territory with Rins insistence that shes Takeyas slave rather than his girlfriend or wife. This brings up an interesting crisis of conscience for Takeya (the male lead) who wants to know how much of Rins affection is obligation versus choice. Later, Miu tries to warn Rin not to overplay the role because slavery is an older custom on earth and reeeeeally not all that trendy anymore. (Yikes!)

To Dear's credit, though, rather than using the ""master/slave"" thing strictly as a cheap running joke, it also uses it to explore the theme of culture shock in surprisingly thoughtful ways. The Dears (aliens) are completely conditioned to serve and put others first, and even the highest-functioning and best-assimilated among them (Miu) find it really hard and frustrating at times to adapt to a human culture that values individualism and making your own choice. Nor is the cultural journey a one-way street: the human characters, especially Takeya, have to learn to meet them halfway to arrive at a mutual understanding everyone can be happy with.

While Dears is good, it has a few shortcomings that knock off a star. The main male character, Takeya, is such a brazen jerk for most of the show that I found it hard to root for him in any capacity. The cast is also much too big for a 13-episode series  Takeyas little sister and the catgirl Dears could have been left out with no harm to the story at all, and several other Dears barely merit their screen time. As I said earlier, this shows animation budget is adequate rather than impressive, and beyond the culture shock thing I mentioned, I don't think it introduces a single new idea into this genre.

But again, despite the pitfalls, this anime belongs in the recommended stack. I laughed the whole way through it, and the series kept me wanting more better than a number of more critically-successful anime I could name, just because the jokes and characters were so well-executed. If you're a fan of the harem-comedy genre, give it a shot.",1424044800,,3578,4.800324675324675

6307072,4,B00IZHPO74,"That right, aliens have made contact with Earth and are amongst us.  Their ship crashed when the star drive malfunctions, landing in Tokyo Bay and inside are a handful of attractive male and female humanoids.  Taking the name DearS, they are starting a homeschool program in order to live with us.  However one human, Takeya, thinks that they are here for more sinister purposes, but that changes when he meets an attractive young lady who he saves from being run over, discovering she is one of these aliens.  Now Ren is living with him, and says she is his slave and he can do whatever he wants with her.  Now as this strange pair get together, they will learn that they have a mutual destiny - provided she does not drive him crazy in the process.

The series was okay, (edit) while Amazon has it listed as Japanese with English Subtitles, it appears that it has been updated to English dub. It is not a deep series, in fact some consider it Chobits with aliens, but still for some light humor and romance it is worth the watch.",1399852800,4,1031,4.457446808510638
