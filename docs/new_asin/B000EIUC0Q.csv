8110488,5,B000EIUC0Q,"LE BAL (aka BALLANDO BALLANDO) is a wonderful and entertaining movie. It will help your enjoyment of the film if you know a little
 French history from the 1930s through the 1970s but it is the music and the dancing that carry the day. Give it a whirl!  Please note
that it is available only on a non-USA format so you will need a region free player to view it.",1438387200,,361,4.142857142857143
8110489,5,B000EIUC0Q,"I saw this film 30 years ago and was delighted to see it was available on DVD. It's even funnier than I remember. The dancers are caricatures OK but their ability to demonstrate the succeeding dance styles and clothes, makeup, etc from 1936 to 1983 is superb. A knowledge of French (Parisian)history between those years enriches the story but you don't really need it to enjoy the spectacle and fun. 5 stars from me.",1393027200,,416,4.635135135135135
8110490,4,B000EIUC0Q,"I saw only about half this film about twenty years ago and found it fascinating. It was televised, perhaps by SBS, and it was pure chance that I caught it. I have never seen or heard of it being repeated. Then I recognised it while browsing through websites on film. Someone was complaining that there was no copy available. I found mine on Amazon and was delighted to renew our acquaintance. Absolutely no dialogue, just lovely old dance music, wonderful characterisation by the dancers and significant points of French history depicted.",1357603200,,538,4.923076923076923
8110491,4,B000EIUC0Q,Wonderful wordless film that says so much. A highly entertaining take on 20th century history through the life in a dancehall.,1325635200,,126,5.0476190476190474
8110492,5,B000EIUC0Q,"I agree with Galena:  this movie was excellent.  I saw it when it was first released in America and fell in love with it, too.  It was based on a theater piece that I would dearly love to see, and, since there's no dialogue, I wonder (as I did then) if there could possibly be an American version in there somewhere.  I really want the DVD (I've got an all-region player, so PAL isn't a problem), but $50.00?  Gee, maybe if I had a job, I'd consider buying it.....",1264291200,,464,4.168539325842697
8110493,5,B000EIUC0Q,"In ""Le Bal"" (1983) directed by Ettore Scola, the 50 year history of Europe happens in front of you in one ballroom somewhere in Paris where the same actors play the different characters that live through their dances from 1930s to the 1980s as the time passes by and politics, social behavior, and fashion change with each new epoch... For less than two hours we would go through the wars, peace, racial conflicts, student riots of  1968  while Ettore Scola's camera never leaves the ballroom.  Dialogues and relationships  are realized through the music and dancing only with no word spoken. Ironically, the film was nominated by the Academy for the Best Foreign Language movie award. It should've been nominated for the best Universal Language award  - the language of music. The  soundtrack features the works  of such composers as Frederick Chopin, Irving Berlin, John Lennon, and Paul Mc Cartney. The original music was written by one of my favorite film composers, Vladimir Cosma. I saw ""Le Bal"" over twenty years ago and it has stayed with me over all these years as fantastic, one of its kind unforgettable film.",1180483200,10,1120,4.894179894179894
