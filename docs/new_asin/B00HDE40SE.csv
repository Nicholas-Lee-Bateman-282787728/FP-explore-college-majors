8631597,5,B00HDE40SE,This is the most enjoyable and an outstanding production of Orfeo ed Euridice that I have watched. The black and white production for CBC television 1961 is very close to the traditional opera and extremely nice and the one with David Hobson and Australian Opera 1994 is the least impressive . The story and the music of Gluck is just fantastic and memorable.,1463702400,,359,4.714285714285714

8631599,5,B00HDE40SE,"This is truly a delight to experience. The playing of the powdered wigged liveried orchestra is sheer delight. The members are similar in number to what would have been present at the premiere in Vienna Burgtheater 5 October 1762. And this orchestra used period instruments. There are only three chararcters: Orfeo, Euridice and Amor. But it is actually a one person work - Orfeo. This was to be the first of Gluck's ""reform"" operas. He did away with all the artificial conventions of the ""opera seria"" style then dominant on the opera stage; Baroque Opera. This was the style of long recitatives, de capo arias, strict plot contrivances as we have in Handel, Vivaldi, Pergolesi etc. In the original 1762 version as presented here there are no recitatives or de capo arias and only short, sweet declamation and arias. The opera lasts only one hour fifteen minutes instead of two or three or more hours. Later Gluck revised it however and added orchestral pieces, more singing and extended ballet for a presentation at the Opera in Paris 1774(as Orphee et Eurydice). Interestingly the version most often played in the 20th century was a version of a contrivance of Berlioz who fashioned a mixture of the 1762 Italian text and the 1774 French text ( in French). This was later translated back to Italian and published in 1889 by Ricordi in Milan. This hybrid became the most popular on the world stage. It is for alto (mezzo) as Orfeo ( to me the most beautiful recording of this version is that by Janet Baker in the 1980s). The original Italian version used an alto castrato, The French 1762 version a high tenor. More recently counter (contre) tenors are being used in a variety of versions.
The present recording uses the unadorned 1762 original. The setting is in an intact Baroque theater in an old deserted castle outside Prague. It is wonderful to see the old theater sets come to life again. Hades is set in the staircases under the castle and the chorus of Furies is garbed  in appropriately sinister (hellish) costumes. Both Amor and Euridice are excellently sung by Regula Muhleman and Eva Liebau. As mentioned earlier this is a ""one person"" show and he is Bejun Mehta and he is superb both in acting and singing. A haunting presentation. Unforgetable.
This is a film, not a performance.",1412121600,3,2297,4.771356783919598
8631600,4,B00HDE40SE,"The singing was marvelous , Orpheo had such stamina and a beautiful counter tenor voice . The music, dancing, staging and lighting. We're well suited to the piece and I loved seeing the inside of the cesky krumlov baroque theatre. I had visited the castle a couple of months ago but missed out on the theatre.",1407369600,,309,4.535714285714286
8631601,4,B00HDE40SE,"esk Krumlov Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has one of the oldest working Baroque theatres in the world and as such it's a fine place to re-examine one of the most important works in the entire opera repertoire in a hopefully more authentic light. With V&aacute;clav Luks conducting the period Collegium 1704 orchestra, a traditionally-informed stage production lit only by wax candles and countertenor singing the role of Orpheus, this Orfeo ed Euridice is undoubtedly closer to the original than most other productions.  There are however a few caveats that can be given about the nature of the film itself.

Primarily, this production of Orfeo ed Euridice is shot as a film, which does take away somewhat from the charm of seeing it performed in a Baroque theatre.  It's not filmed in the traditional manner of a live theatre performance, but it is clearly a live performance, shot over a number of takes, with perhaps a small amount of overdubs.  Musically though, it sounds wonderful, the theatre creating a natural acoustic reverb rather than an amplified sound.  There is rather a harder edged gut string pluck and rhythm that isn't quite so smooth, and heard this way it does present the opera in a new light.

This works wonderfully when its performed in Act I on the stage of the Baroque theatre where Orpheus mourns the death of Eurydice.  It's old-style theatre, with painted forests to the wings and a sea at the back with old-fashioned pulley-operated rolling sea effects.  Amore too descends in an authentically shaky manner on a mechanical cloud to give Orpheus a chance to bring his beloved back to the land of the living.  Unfortunately, once Orpheus descends through the trapdoor to the Underworld, much of the remainder of the performance takes place in the wider setting of the backstage and the caverns of the castle and - other than the Elysium scene - not on the stage at all.

The locations backstage and in the wings are at least well used in this respect, retaining the candlelight illuminations, giving the underworld a suitably eerie and otherworldly appearance.  Even here, with wooden beams and stone staircases, there are no anachronisms, although you would suspect that the Furies might be familiar with the ""zombie shuffle"" choreography of Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video.  There are also some clever touches like the play of shadows embracing and holding hands as Orpheus leads Eurydice out of the underworld that don't need to rely on special effects.  The idea is nice, playing on the magic of the theatre experience and how it extends beyond the stage and takes on a life of its own, but I did find that the 'film' concept and editing distracted a little from the power of the work itself.

The original 1762 Vienna edition of the work has also been cut back slightly with most of the ballets shortened or excised entirely.  The Act III Scene 3 dances, for example, are all missing.  I suspect that the decision was made for artistic reasons (Bejun Mehta is credited also as Artistic Advisor here), since they get in the way of the clear narrative flow that is needed more for the film than a stage production, but such cuts aren't unusual. This is however a good account of the work that sounds wonderful, matching the stripped-back reformist nature of the work with a reduced period orchestra.  The casting is also good with Bejun Mehta's sweet countertenor giving this Orpheus a suitably lyrical quality, Eva Liebau presenting a strong Eurydice and Regula M&uuml;hlemann a bright Amore.

On Blu-ray, this looks very fine indeed.  There's a slightly softer edge to the image on account of it being filmed by candlelight, but it's clear and detailed with lovely tones and textures.  The audio mixes are PCM stereo and DTS HD-master Audio 5.0.  The mix is bright but there's a pleasant naturalness to the sound.  The balance between the voices and the orchestra is different in the two mixes, the surround track seeming to make more use of reverb and give prominence to the voices, while the stereo track is more direct and evenly balanced.  There are no extras on the BD25 region-free disc (a documentary on the restoration of the theatre can be found on the DVD/BD release of Domenico Scarlatti's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dove-egrave-Amore-egrave-Gelosia/dp/B00C7UJBSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dove &egrave; Amore &egrave; Gelosia</a>), but the booklet gives some background on how the film was made and the history of the Baroque theatre.  There's no synopsis provided, but the plot of Orfeo ed Euridice is simplicity itself.  Subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.",1400803200,4,4699,5.071428571428571
