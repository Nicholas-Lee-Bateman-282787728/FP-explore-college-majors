675425,5,6303510108,"After years of wanting to figure out this teechnique, at last I found someone else as crazy as I am who has managed to do it.  This video comes with a chart and materials list for making your own bead knitted drawstring bag from 11/0 beads (the size most readily available in modern beads.)  Alice Korach gives a concise review of knitting techniques and then shows you how to make your own bag, step by step.  She employs a technique to eliminate the bias in your work (the tradeoff is that the beads alternate directions every other row, creating a herringbone pattern in their orientation-- all the antique bead knitted bags I've seen have the beads oriented in a single direction.)  Korach's instructions are clear, precise, and easy to follow.  If you don't know how to knit well, Korach recommends that you use ""Mary Thomas's Knitting Book"" as reference for knitting practice (I heartily concur, as knitting with beads is slow and difficult, and it's well worth learning to knit decently first!)  I'm just in the preliminary stages of mastering this technique, but feel like I can proceed with confidence thanks to this video.",1044144000,9,1132,4.809278350515464
675575,5,6303510108,"Very cute-but NOT animated as one might think. This was purchased for a teenager and they loved it. It's more like a Broadway Style type of musical and is something the whole family can enjoy in the comfort of your living room. It is very entertaining and just different enough not to be the same old repeat as you can expect from other musicals.
Donkey is just as funny here and there is a cd that can be purchased in addition to this musical, but does not come included.
The singers sound similar to the original characters from the animated movie- so all in all have to say this was 2 thumbs up!",1513036800,,598,4.300884955752212

675584,2,6303510108,"Definitely rent before you buy!  As big fans of the cartoon movie, we had high expectations for this musical performance.  While the performers were talented and there were some praise worthy performances, I felt that the overall presentation was forced and several of the performers bore little resemblance in appearance or voice to the original actors.  I felt the production was slow to get started and heard several critical comments from the kids about how these characters were not from Shrek. There were also several variations from the original story line.

I was surprised at the performance after reading the nearly unanimous 5-star reviews.  Maybe I just don't have the sophistication to enjoy this performance , but it's a kids show and they didn't seem to like it very much either.  I would strongly recommend a rental before purchasing this movie.",1501977600,,861,5.070921985815603

As a Theatre teacher, I'm so excited that Amazon offers recordings of live stage shows like this, so I can expose my students to the wonder and amazement of Broadway.  The only complaint I have is with the sound quality of the video playback, I had to turn my computer and speaker volume all the way up to 100% and it still was difficult to hear from some parts of my classroom, and you know you can never keep the students completely quiet in your own room, not to mention noise from neighboring classrooms.  It has to be with Amazon, because when I watch clips from youtube, the volume level was great.

The real show stopper is Who I'd Be that Shrek sings at the end of the first act with a little bit of Donkey and Ogre Fiona in the background.
Farquad was hilarious and inloved how they made him look so short.

Always, however this musical is based on the Broadway medium: songs, dance numbers, and keeping the audience entertained. It is a pleasure to be able to see the work of Brian Darcy James and Sutton Foster, two of Broadways major stars of today.

I was, however, Not enthusiastic when I learned it was being made into a musical.  What? A singing Shrek? Couldn't imagine it.  Truthfully, I may never have even seen it if our high school drama department hadn't staged the production last spring.  So glad I did see it.  The show is fantastic!  Everyone will love it because It has so much wit, and charm and wonderful music.  It was written with reverence to the original story, and some of my favorite scenes incorporate lines directly from the movie.  It is just wonderful.

Well I decided when it hit Netflixs to give it a try and all I was left to say was WOW. Even if you not a fan of the Shrek franchise this production is very well done. Sutton Foster is amazing and very talented actress. Daniel Breaker made donkey and stole the show. His humor was on a whole other level. Most of all Brian D'Arcy James as Shrek, this show couldn't have cast better. My only regret is that I never saw this live in person! With the Blu-ray/Dvd is a real steal @18 dollars.

There's a ""making of..."" bonus that's maybe 3 minutes long. Other than that they have ""sing-a-longs"" for a few select songs....but it's essentially watching the songs with closed captioning on...nothing special. That's about it....unless you're really in to having access to the film in several different formats.

The last time I was this bored at a musical, it was Pretty Baby the Musical (yeah, that really happened), but at least that had some good music.

The voices are amazing and the stage adaption brings so much more emotion and depth to the characters while still entertaining the kids. Yes, as many of the negative reviews will state, there are fart jokes  but (doh) so were the jokes in the movie Shrek. So, if you liked the movie, you will love this adaption. If you hated the movie, then skip it.

I truly wish stage shows would continue this positive trend of producing DVD/Blu Ray/Digital copies of their shows to made available to the public. We don't all live in NYC and many of us hate waiting for several years to see the exciting shows tour through our town. Popular (outdated) opinions state by doing so, ticket sales for the live show will decrease. But, in my opinion, it will actually generate buzz and excitement so that people will want to see the show live and ""feel"" the booming voices from the songs they have grown to love on the videos. The Wiggles shows were always packed even though they came to our living room every day. :)

677054,5,6303510108,"I'm really glad this was videoed for posterity, because besides it being a fun and underrated musical (it played better in the West End, and I wonder if the genre of ""pantomime"", which really doesn't exist in America, makes it make more sense), it preserves for posterity the fabulous dancing and surprisingly sensitive acting by Sutton Foster as Fiona.  I wish someone would quietly make one of these for every major Broadway production, even if they had to be in a vault for ten years or go in the Library of Congress to avoid reducing ticket sales.  We've already lost so many performances or have them only on audio.  Not everyone has the means to go to New York, and road companies are NOT the same.",1400976000,,704,4.571428571428571

The adaptation from the DreamWorks ""Shrek"" to the stage was magnificent.  I was amazed how well the actual Broadway play was then made into this movie version.  Sutton Foster, Brian D'Arcy James, Daniel Breaker, and Christopher Sieber are outstanding in this play version.  Get this DVD to find out who plays which character.  Everyone that had anything to do with this production must be commended--including, everyone from the entire cast, the stage hands, the makeup specialists, the costume designers, the writer of the musical score, the orchestra, the film crew & editing, etc.  If you want to have some fun check out some of the stuff on the internet about cast members and about the actual filming of the  play.

The creators of this musical made things just different enough that it's not an exact clone of the movie.

Just to note some highlights:

- They've managed to find actors who sound like the movie characters and can sing very well. Sutton Foster's (Fionna) voice is particularly warm.  She'd make a pefect Belle in Beauty & the Beast.

- The Princess Tower song.  Brilliant.  Having three actresses portray the princess as a child, adolescent and grown up, just to have them finish off the song together.  Definitely not in the movie.

- Lord Farquaad's legs.  I can't stop looking at Farquaad.  This is so funny.  Look it up.  I can't stop laughing...

- Who I'd be (song) - Talk about inspirational.  Easily one of the more moving songs in this musical.

- Pied Pipe - Curtains partially drawn with tap dancing rats.  Clever.

If you loved the original movie, you'll love this.  If you love theater, you'll love this.  The cast is phenomenal, the costumes are perfect, and you get a Broadway show in the comfort of your own home for a fifth of the cost that you would pay to see it in NYC.

My only real gripe about this is that, like most shows that have been filmed live, some of the editing is a little wonky; you don't get a clear picture of all of the dance numbers because of close-ups and quick cuts.",1386547200,,778,4.26530612244898

It's tough to put a cartoon into a live musical play, but like the Lion King, this one was really successful. All of the principles are fabulous in their roles. Pinocchio hits some amazing soprano notes. Donkey is just as funny if not funnier than Eddie Murphy. The background stories and some of the extra items that were added to the original Shrek story fleshed out the characters even more and gave you more of a reason to love them. Even Farquod has a back story. Would love to know Donkey's back story, but some other time I suppose.",1385251200,10,661,4.338709677419355

For one, you're watching the original cast. That's pretty incredible. The audio is top notch, and the lighting, camera angles, and overall film production was great.

The show itself is also very good. I rank shows on a 4-star scale, and I would give Shrek the Musical a 3 star rating.

It has some very catchy songs, and is pretty funny at times. Don't expect the same exact jokes that you saw in the movie. There are some hilarious references to other popular Broadway shows, which is great. The movie satirized pop culture, and the show satirizes other shows. Brilliant.

If you love Broadway musicals and you happened to miss this one during its brief run, it's definitely worth watching. If you're not so much into musicals, you might still enjoy it, but perhaps not as much as people who are used to watching stage productions.",1384387200,,903,4.660377358490566

The show is more enjoyable if you've already seen the cartoon, since little effort went into the story line.  The songs are lively, spirited, and want you to sing along.  The acting is good with reasonable camera work.  No video can match a live show, but this really tries hard.  Broadway, are you listening?  There are a lot of shows that either can't tour due to set design, or won't tour due to closing early.  A video might help in the bottom line.

I have only two complaints:  1. The DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital copy doesn't transfer to a Mac computer, even though it is coming from iTunes.  Apparently it only connects with a PC.  The Ultraviolet expects you to join Vudu of Flixter to watch it on your portable device.

677678,5,6303510108,"When Dreamworks first released the original CGI film, SHREK, it gave Disney's animation studio a run for their money. It even poked fun at Disney characters. It took the position that adults could enjoy some double-entendre humor while the kids would love the graphics. SHREK spawned two sequels too! Then Dreamworks decided (like Disney with ""Beauty and the Beast"" to conquer Broadway by creating - and producing - a musical version of the film. The 2009 show got nine Tony noms (no wins) and played successfully in NY. A whopping 17 songs (in a two-hour show) were composed by Pulitzer Prize winner David Lindsay-Abaire and Jeanine Tesori to keep the show going. The music is - in my opinion - a combination of Alan Menken's score for ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and Marc Shaiman's for ""Hairspray"". A lot of fun.

So, with Dreamworks being a FILM company, they decided to film a live performance with the ORIGINAL Broadway Cast (before they left the company). And that resulted in this 2012 production, just out on DVD and BD.

There are already quite a few reviews here - and you probably already know the basic story line - so I won't repeat much of what has been written but will ""fill in"" some more info.

First, I agree with others in that I'm thankful that an ORIGINAL CAST production has been captured and preserved for generations to come. Very few, if any, such productions have been made for the general public to see. You don't need to travel to New York, or even spent $50-$70 for a ticket for a touring production, to  enjoy the show. And you'd never be this close. The Director of the filmed production has a tough job deciding when to show the whole stage and when to use close-ups and director Michael Warren did a pretty good job with his 10 cameras. And the makeup is so good that it doesn't even look like makeup on the close shots.

Someone questioned the ""off color"" humor and I will alert you that there is a musical number based on flatulence but it's done lightly and is the kind of humor that kids find ""silly"". There are no expletives in the dialogue.
Another reviewer said there was not a curtain call. There certainly is. First we are given the one non-original song. It's the curtain call number: The Monkees' hit ""I'm a Believer"". And then the major cast members are identified as they take their bows.

The bonuses on the DVD and BD are slightly different. Both have a really nice feature called ""Shrek: The Musical Songbook"" which allows you to replay seven of the musical numbers with a further option of having the lyrics on the screen to sing along. The BD is in High Def as well as having one extra bonus: ""From Swamp to Stage"" - a brief 8 minute featurette (introduced by Cameron Diaz - from the animated version) with comments from the composers. There is also a set of promos for other Dreamworks Animation films.

Considering the price of a Broadway show ticket and the fact that this cast will never be together again, this DVD BD is a bargain and a must for Broadway cast lovers. A solid FIVE stars from me.

Let's hope more producing companies give us opportunities like Dreamworks is.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

677728,5,6303510108,"We saw this show 3 times on Broadway with the original cast.... Then saw ""highlights"" with some of the cast at 106.7 WLTW's Broadway in Bryant Park.  This video brought back memories for my family and was a hit with my son (who remembered most of the lyrics).  While little beats the real/live Broadway experience, this really captured the fantastic performances by the troupe.  I still love how Christopher Sieber managed his performance entirely on his knees.  While I could go on and on about Brian and Sutton's performance---- I think John Tartaglia was so good as Pinnochio (as well as the Mirror and his assorted other puppetry).  Lots of energy by the entire cast

Technically, they captured the sound and image as accurately as they could with an actual live production.  While a few shots showed an audience...I couldn't imagine what the experience might have been watching the show while they were filming as there were plenty of on stage shots with steadicams, cranes, and other rigging.

Was well worth the purchase to keep this short run on Broadway musical alive in my family--- It was a very special time for my family back in 2008-09 when it had it's run.  Glad I bought it!",1382400000,,1190,4.737864077669903
677729,5,6303510108,I absolutely love this show.  If you enjoy Broadway musicals then please buy this.  If the sales are good it might convince them to release more Broadway shows this way which would be awesome.  There are several great musical numbers.  The only bad thing about it is that the character of Donkey is much more annoying than he was in the movie and there's too much dialogue that's taken word for word from the movie which really isn't necessary.  Other than that this show is excellent and I'm very happy with my purchase.,1382140800,,521,4.559139784946237
677730,3,6303510108,"You do get most of the show and this is a must have for musical theatre buffs.  I hope that a lot of people buy this, so that videos of Broadway musicals become an important revenue flow and are made  available for most such shows. However, they should not be as badly directed and edited as this.  It is likely that this video is meant for those who would usually be disinclined to buy a video of a Broadway musical.  A clue is that there is no mention of any of the cast, writers or director anywhere whatsoever in the packaging.

Firstly, Shrek - The Musical is a mediocre musical with undistinguished, sometimes bouncy music and the preachy, not always appropriate for kids libretto, but that is NOT my problem with the video. The main camera is placed at such a low level that we are often looking up at the performances from below.  The angle is uncomfortable to watch and makes the actors look odd and the sets look ugly.  The relentless cross cutting, camera movement and up the actor's noses close-ups further contribute to make the video uncomfortable to watch, and an assault on our senses.

And how can anyone not know that the curtain calls are an integral part of the theatre going experience.  Without them (and they are at least as carefully directed and choreographed as anything else in the show), the video is simply incomplete.  In place of the curtain calls, there is a post video, credit sequence in which the (about) half dozen lead actors are individually credited on screen while stills of them from the performance (including one still of each one's bows).  The balance of the end credits are on a standard crawl.  It would have been better, although still unsatisfactory, if the curtain calls were at least added as a bonus feature. The video is extremely sparse as to bonus features.

Compared to the sensational video of Phantom of the Opera (I think its from an Australian production) and the fine video of Memphis (B'way production), this video is a major step backward.",1382140800,3,2001,4.650568181818182

Which is probably why you will find it odd when I say:  It wasn't all that good!  WHAAAAT?  What I mean is: ""It Probably Won't Win Any Awards"" sort of good. However, for just plain old silly fun LAUGH OUT LOUD entertainment, this movie/musical is definitely something you'll want to see...and add to your DVD collection!

The story moves along at a lively pace with never a dull moment.  (In case you are the only person on earth not familiar with Shrek, he is a smelly yet likable ogre who finds his swamp over-run with multitudes of fairy creature squatters.  In order to get rid of them, he must rescue the princess Fiona from the Dragon's Keep, and return her to the self centered ninny Lord Farquod).  The play is also very colorful with wonderful scenery.  The music is enjoyable - and the costumes are fantastic.  Sutton Foster as Fiona is amazing  (I miss you on Bunheads, Sutton)!

In Shrek the Musical, we learn some interesting ""back story"" about Shrek.  Mostly, though, the play sticks to the first Shrek movie plot.  All the favorites are there - including Pinnocchio, the gingerbread man, the three pigs, the gender confused wolf, and others.

What was wrong with the musical?  Well...there were a few sort of tasteless lines they could have done without, such as one of the fairy creatures claiming that the swamp ""smelled like butt.""  Just....no.....

Also, they kept calling the gender confused wolf a cross-dressing wolf - I guess to be ""edgier,"" since being edgy is so in style lately.  Really though...not necessary.

There were some bodily functions jokes which my husband loved.......little kids also will love them, trust me......but...just be prepared.  The actors pull it all off in a mostly likable way, though...it's just all part of the pervasive silliness.

And speaking of silly, YES, that is the word of the day when it comes to this musical!  It is much sillier than the actual Shrek movie.  My family couldn't stop laughing, so I guess that's a good thing, right?  Laughing is healthy and fun - and this musical will definitely make you laugh!  Another good thing, is that this DVD is good for ALL AGES!  It's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.

While not every musical has turned out, and I have seen my share of flops too, this was not one of them. I was a bit skeptical at first, not knowing what to expect, and wondering whether the musical would be lacking in regards to story line, or whether it would simply be a retelling of the movie itself, it wasn't. Filled with amazing acting, great songs, and tons of humor, this was a great musical that kept my family and I laughing and loving every minute of it from beginning to end.

I was so glad that this was the original cast as I am a huge fan of Sutton Foster and Brian d'Arcy and knew that they had done an amazing job in this too, but alas I was not able to see it while they were in it (in it's NYC run). Beyond these two actors though I have to say that the whole cast just worked. They acted as a team, which you don't always see on stage.

This was a fun musical for the whole family! Whether you are a fan of the Shrek movies or not, you will love this musical. The music alone is worth the time, but add onto that great acting and plot and you get a fun family night!
