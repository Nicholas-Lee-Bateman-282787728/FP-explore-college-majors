8296064,3,B001E1DGEQ,"Here's some good news for the disappointed, frustrated reviewers that only got to see the abbreviated, English-dubbed US release. The original's available...at Amazon.fr: No subtitles, so anglophones will have to make do.

Alas, the cast and crew are sort of wasted on a story that can't seem to gain traction, and a dialogue that in some places is stagey and declamatory.

Gabin predictably dominates the film. Madeleine Renaud and Michele Morgan are nicely decorative, particularly the latter in the scene where she's fished out of the ocean. But their roles are unsatisfying, and unequal to their talents. This was 1941; maybe they just needed the work. Fernand Le Doux certainly must have. You can forget his top-drawer performances in Bete Humaine and Visiteurs du Soir; in Remorques, he just hasn't got an awful lot to do.

That's not to say that Remorques should be dismissed. It's well-filmed, in part by Louis Nee, whose credits include ""Wages of Fear."" Alexander (Hotel du Nord) Trauner, something of a legend, designed the production. And Nicolas Wilcke was likely responsible for some impressive models and miniatures work. Wartime French cinema  didn't have much to draw on in the special effects department. All the same, those little toy boats in a tank are pretty convincing.

And, please, let's not forget that score. Certainly respectable in its own right, and graced by the baton of Roger Desormiere. He had an extraordinary career, and a tragic one. He was a superior musician who offered the same dedication and talent to film scores as he did to the classics and the avant-garde.",1332460800,,1601,5.049242424242424
8296065,1,B001E1DGEQ,"I agree entirely with the above reviews. The transfer quality of this DVD is absolutely terrible, however the story is so compelling that I stayed with it.

I thank the first reviewer for explaining at least one big gap in the story as recorded. It boggles the mind why MGM would cut the section described as it doesn't seem to have been a Code violation.

Although I'd much prefer the original French dialog track with English subtitles, I thought the dubbing wasn't too bad, but it's lost in the poor quality of the audio which is heavily distorted in the loud parts.

Given the choice of this version on DVD versus nothing at all, I'd say get this version -- however be aware that it has many faults and it will leave you wanting to find a better version.

I rate the film 5/5 but this transfer 1/5.",1303516800,3,802,4.398648648648648
8296066,2,B001E1DGEQ,"I wrote a book about Jean Gabin, WORLD'S COOLEST MOVIE STAR, and I am one of the biggest fans of the uncut, French-language version of director Jean Gremillon's ""Remorques"" (aka, ""Stormy Waters""). But please avoid this DVD at all costs.

The original French language print of 1941's ""Remorques"" is just as moving and powerful as are any of Jean Gabin's other great movies from the same period -- ""Le Jour se leve,"" ""Le Quai des brumes,"" ""La Bete humaine,"" etc.  But the version contained on this DVD has been transferred from the bastardized American print, which was released by MGM in 1946. For one thing, the version of the film available on this DVD is about ten minutes shorter than the original French-language print of the film, because MGM, back in 1946, decided to eliminate a lot of important sequences -- this renders their version of the film unwatchable. In the uncut version of the film, Gabin's character is tortured by his wife's fate, and he offers up one of his typically very moving performances. But in the ""expurgated"" version, the one which is available on this DVD, he doesn't seem to care about her at all. Too, the version of the film on this DVD is dubbed into English and not subtitled, and the names of some of the principal characters have even been changed.

""Remorques"" is a fantastic Jean Gabin movie, but please wait for (and hope for) an uncut, English-subtitled release in the future. You'll like it a lot better!",1254009600,9,1448,4.715415019762846
8296067,1,B001E1DGEQ,"This would be an awesome film if only the producers/distributors kept the original English language and had not dubbed it into English. The loss of the incomparable voice of Jean Gabin alone makes it reason enough to not even bother buying this DVD. If you want to share this rare treasure from our cinematic history, invest into it and offer a dubbed version along with the original soundtrack and subtitle options. Such a pity.",1233705600,6,429,4.8108108108108105
