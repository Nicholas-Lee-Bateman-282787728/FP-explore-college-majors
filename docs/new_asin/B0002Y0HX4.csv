8034432,1,B0002Y0HX4,"The guy's weird and inconsistent.  He'll do a set of 5 on one side and then a set of 3.  He'll perform one side fast, and the other side at a slower rate.  Get the Butt Book instead by Tosca Reno.  Wished it was available on DVD.",1288828800,,229,3.8085106382978724
8034433,3,B0002Y0HX4,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I consider myself an Intermediate/Advanced Exerciser.  I am certainly no beginner to exercise and own well over a hundred workout DVD's.  This DVD offered nothing special.  There is only one set provided for each exercise and the reps are in a moderate range.  You basically get 3 exercise sections on this DVD.  Each section is 15 minutes long- 10 minutes of exercise and 5 minutes of stretching.  I expected more exercise for the price.  It was way too easy and not at all challenging.  Even when I repeated sections to try to give myself a better lower body workout, the next day I wasn't really sore.  I did not feel like this provided my muscles anything new and found it very basic and not at all Challenging.

If you are a beginner-Intermedite exerciser or want something low-key and not too challenging then this may be good for you.  If you have been exercising for a while and looking for something to challenge your muscles keep looking!",1286150400,3,986,4.635838150289017
8034434,4,B0002Y0HX4,"Overall happy with DVD.  Exercises are low-impact but effective and you are definately sweating at the end.  The overall feeling of the DVD is calming but David's voice is very monotone and boring.  After I learned the proper techniques, I play my own music with the DVD.",1266019200,,271,4.723404255319149
8034435,5,B0002Y0HX4,This workout I can't say enough good things about it. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I have seen amazing results. No equipment required just a chair. No jumping and jolting your body around. I must say I'm addicted.,1151798400,6,227,4.3023255813953485
8034436,2,B0002Y0HX4,"David Kirsch needs to stop touting his own horn- his little  ""distinctively david"" tips are annoying (because he is not the first person to come up with the workouts he teaches) and WE KNOW he works with stars like heidi klum- give it a rest already.

Instead,  for a really good weights (all round and in segments of arms, legs, butt, abs, plus extras) DVD buy Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2.",1129334400,7,406,4.45945945945946
8034437,5,B0002Y0HX4,"Truly a gem!  David's instructions are crystal clear and his hints are simply brilliant.  The exercises are easy enough so that you don't give up after the first workout, but hard enough so that you know if you're doing them correctly.",1125878400,6,235,4.7073170731707314
8034438,4,B0002Y0HX4,This is a great tape for those days when you don't want to get all sweaty doing cardio.  Great for toning and sculpting.  I have the Boot Camp video and love it as well. I thought my legs would hurt more the next day but I definitely felt it in different areas. You should just progress to higher weights.  David Kirsch is a great motivator and breaks down all the moves for you.  The last 15 minutes combine both butt and legs and you definitely feel it then. Highly recommended.,1102550400,17,480,4.3
8034439,5,B0002Y0HX4,"I had the privelege of working out with David when I appeared on Extreme Makeover. I have continued his fitness routines for over a year. The videos give you ""distintively David"" tweeks to each exercise that make them more effective. Why waste your time doing exercises that don't work. David's tips and exact ""sculpting"" moves gives you more ""bang for your buck""!!!

These videos work!!!
