1567705,5,B00005JPNV,"This was absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. If I could I would definitely, without a doubt, give it more than five stars. Drew Fuller, who played Jason Stevens, did an amazing job. He is one of my favorite actors which is the main reason I was inspired to go see this movie. It was even more than I expected; I expected it to be good, but I never thought it would be quite that good. I do not want to give anything away so I must instist that EVERYONE go see this movie and find out just how GREAT it is for themselves. Definitely one of the BEST films of the year; a must see.",1173744000,10,594,3.9583333333333335
1567706,4,B00005JPNV,"Go and see The Ultimate Gift.

Don't walk - run to the theater. The only forewarning I will bestow upon you is to bring tissues. Lots of tissues.

The Ultimate Gift is well scripted, well directed, and well cast. Its premise and resolution are quite predictable; nevertheless, it's quite enjoyable to watch the characters develop and overcome obstacles.

Unlike Little Miss Sunshine<, which was an ensemble film, all the strengths in this movie are solely due to Breslin's impressive performance. Little Miss Sunshine would've suffered terrible had Olive been played by anyone else, whereas The Ultimate Gift wouldn't even be a movie if Abigail Breslin did not play Emily. If you were amused by Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine, if you found her even remotely funny, you will find her absolutely lovely and endearing in The Ultimate Gift.

If Abigail can maintain this level of intensity in her performances I see Oscars lined up at her feet. She is undoubtedly on her path to becoming the next Jodie Foster.

Don't let the fact that this is advertised as ""a Christian film"" discourage you from seeing it. It hardly mentions Christianity. It is more about humanity and becoming the person we all wish to be than about religion.

During the movie, laughs and sniffles could be overhead over the crunching of the popcorn. I even found myself clapping half way through the movie. In fact, the moviegoers were so captivated by the film that most remained in their seats all throughout the entire credit sequence at the end. How often does that happen? Usually people are too eager to storm out of the theater and go back to their lives. Not this time. People wanted to treasure every little bit of this movie.

My mom bawled during the movie and she isn't opt to do that. I had to clean my glasses on more than one occasion too. This movie is a tearjerker but a really good one.",1173312000,24,1873,4.709480122324159

1568358,5,B00005JPNV,"I watched this movie for free because its included with my Prime membership. I LOVE IT!! I never would have discovered it and I am so thankful for everyone who had a part in making it. Its a little bit of an onconvential chic flic (heartwarming, but not silly and stereotypical.) If you're thinking of getting this as a gift or just unsure of what to watch tonight, GET IT!! Im going to have my fianc watch it tonight and Ill enjoy seeing it twice in one day!

That being said, if you're so uptight about other peoples beliefs that you cant stand the mention of God, Jesus, Christmas, Christianity,,,, etc, don't wants this. If you cannot relate to a child being wise beyond his/her years due to having to grow up fast, don't waste your time. Its a great movie but so many of the 1 star votes are due to the mention of religion or calling the movie unrelatable because of their tunnel vision.",1522886400,,892,4.373493975903615

1568598,5,B00005JPNV,"""The Ultimate Gift"" is one of my favorite movies and books. Drew Fuller portrays Jason superbly and Abigail Breslin gives a great performance as Emily Rose. It is quite an entertaining story that moves quickly.  It includes romance and adventure as well as truths to take to heart.  The stoic James Garner delivers as expected (fabulous).

1569220,5,B00005JPNV,"If you are a fan of Drew Fuller (Jason), then you will love this movie.  But being a fan of his isn't enough. But let me tell you - it is. If you are a fan, he's earned it with his previous work - so, go on this ride with him. I am telling you what - this is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a long time.  Breslin, is the gift that breaks up the movie and gives it a sense of humor.

Seriously, this is a beautiful movie, a beautiful message, beautifully made, a gorgeous cast, great locales, 5 stars all the way around.

Now, I have to go look up his work besides this gem, his work on Charmed (he was my fave character on there) & a couple of other movies.

Either by his own choice or by the powers that be - he is way underused & under rated.  He's a great actor, has looks that would make anyone follow him into a volcano.

But it is more.  In this movie, the magic is his acting style helped along by the work of the other actors. You just wanted to root for Jason, but it's because ""Red"" and a couple of other ppl saw something in him.

Anyway, I highly recommend this.",1520726400,,1091,3.9004524886877827

1569225,2,B00005JPNV,"If you made a movie from the CliffsNotes of a novel that wasn't all that great to begin with, this would be the result. None of the characters in this film behave in any way similarly to humans. All are bad caricatures of stereotypes, lacking depth or character development. The awkward injection of religion into the story was offensive and unnecessary, and detracted from an already weak narrative. I want my evening back!",1520640000,,424,4.821917808219178

1569249,4,B00005JPNV,"We go through this film like the protagonist, not knowing what's going to happen next. The grandfather could not know that his grandson would meet Abigail Breslin and what that would do to him, but the challenges were good, bigger than expected and life-changing. I like a show that doesn't hit you over the head with its lessons and spirituality. It's a show with humor, depth, a hero's journey. No sex, no bad language--or not much, no drugs, no violence, good storytelling that kept my interest throughout. What was the ultimate gift? Not the supposed inheritance, I think we get to know that for ourselves. It was a gift of a movie.",1520553600,,636,4.6875

My gifts were a little different but I've experienced all of these gifts in my lifetime.  Some of these I never thought of as gifts until now.  Watch this to find out about the gifts of work, money, friends, learning, problems, family, laughter, dreams, giving, gratitude, perfect day and love.  There was another important gift that the movie alluded to but never said that was the most important gift of all - the gift of faith.",1520553600,,545,4.5

I wish I could say I've met more than one attorney in my entire life that I liked; that I've met a single wealthy person that I admire. But, alas, I have not. Moreover, this movie was so predictable.

The characters seemed very contrived and two-dimensional.  I'm not a fan of religion either and didn't expect to see it here.  If you love yourself some Jesus, then I'm sure love this fairy tale of a movie.  I watched it until the end because I hoped there would be some redeeming quality to the movie, but alas...

That Jason would venture into the deadly land of the drug lords is unbelievable, and that his captors would leave his cell unlocked and that he could escape are even more unbelievable.

1570568,1,B00005JPNV,"A typical ""inspirational"" christian film made by self-righteous people for a self-righteous audience. The protagonist is a stereotypical millennial made to look selfish, but unable to do anything truly bad because the film entirely relies on false dilemmas, hasty generalizations, appeals to ignorance, appeals to hypocrisy, and more. The gifts are hard work, the loss of privilege, the value of money, the acceptance of challenges, the value of friendship, and more. While these are noble qualities, the filmmaker presents them in the typical ""tough love"" style that christians use to justify their hypocrisy. The film avoids much explicit discussions of religion, except in one scene where it is appropriate since a child suffering from cancer is sitting in the hospital's chapel. A better discussion would focus not on whether the child will go to heaven, but what kind of cruel, sick deity would allow children to get cancer and why should humans show any deference to such a being? I wanted to throttle the director when the main character's date starts crying and leaves because she might have to pay the bill. The protagonist's fear of public transportation was equally insipid. It's hard not to imagine most of the older characters, and the film's target audience, grumbling about young people being a waste while simultaneously ignoring how they themselves are responsible for ruining the economy, poisoning the environment, and crippling the job market so that young people can't do anything to improve their lot. If you want a better inspirational film, I recommend ""The Mighty Ducks"".",1468627200,5,1596,5.23828125

In this movie James Garner picks one what he thinks is the most promising of his heirs and sets a series of challenges designed to impart some values in him. At first he is only in it for the money, but an unlikely and unplanned meeting changes everything. I enjoyed the finesse that James Garner showed in the creation of his will - it showed how well he knew his family.

I have passed them on to family and friends and they have boughten copies for their children and family members as I did.,1404000000,,276,4.12962962962963
1574229,4,B00005JPNV,"This film inspires strong feelings, and I considered giving it one, two, or five stars.  What is most off is the script.  It is hard to sympathize with a family and protagonist so phenomenally privileged (this is one of the reasons that people hated GW Bush).  It is questionable to glorify a grandfather whose fortune was made in oil and commercial farming.  I was uncomfortable with the suggestions of prosperity gospel and the depiction of such a stark about-face in the life of the main character.  I didn't like the fact that he never really had to choose between worldly riches and spiritual ones.  Taken literally, as other reviewers will tell you, the characters have questionable sincerity and a lack of depth.

That said, the acting and filming is fairly well-done, with Abigail Breslin phenomenal as the daughter of the single mother and love interest.  I also loved the statement by the mother that her daughter was the best choice she had ever made.  Additionally, there is a touching relationship between the protagonist and these characters that seems authentic and valuable.  In contrast, the shallowness of a former love interest and of the protagonists' family is fairly well-shown.  I received this film from the public library, and it included a Bible study, which added depth to the film and was was valuable to me and my family.

This film is recommended for families, including children, and for discussion of its pros and cons.  Perhaps it gives a beneficial if uncomfortably realistic stereotype of the Christian Right in American.  In all, the series of gifts are indeed valuable for believers and skeptics to consider; it is also valuable to consider how the should be sought in the more sophisticated context of real life.",1403654400,,1750,4.948630136986301

1574234,5,B00005JPNV,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen . the acting was excellent. I loved the story and thought it was very original.
A very decent movie for the whole family. This movie was about a very greedy, rich family that received an inheritance from the father that died. They all got what they deserved except for the young grandson that lost his father while on a mission with his grandfather. The young man was very spoiled and had to go through a series of experiences in order to get the ultimate gift. Along the way he grew up into a very good, noble man. I truly enjoyed the story and outcome. The Christian message was very gentle but certainly it was a Christian movie. I truly enjoyed it. It was funny and inspiring while at the same time true to life where life does not always take us where we want to ever go. A must see for anyone with a heart.",1403222400,,870,4.2155688622754495

1574256,4,B00005JPNV,The actors do a lovely job of playing endearing characters who are as two-dimensional as paper dolls.  This is a lovely film if you feel the need to be reminded that Life is a Gift Not to Be Wasted or to Enjoy Precious Moments.  Perhaps it should be prescribed as a stop-gap if your mood-defining medication isn't quite up to par.,1403136000,,330,4.39344262295082

1574336,5,B00005JPNV,This is an outstanding family storyline DVD. The subject involved of bettering one in character build is well put forth by a young man from a wealthy family. He must learn to work for his inheritance & does by an intriguing story. His grandfather played by James Garner leaves a legacy for the young man to build upon. A side story line of a terminally ill young girl aids in this but not before the young man must go through some hardship experiences such as rebel captivity. It's well worth one's time to wirness this story.,1401840000,,526,4.489583333333333

1574339,5,B00005JPNV,"This was the BEST MOVIE I have ever seen. It really makes you stop and think. So that you take a look at your life and see if this is the way you really want it to be?
This movie shows you that you can change yourself to be a better person. It shows you just how fast you could go from rich to poor in a flash. And that money can't always give you what you want.
The movie also shows how anybody could die, wether they are a baby or child or teenager or young parent or Grandparant. It teaches you that the strong people are the sick one's and the healthy one's are family or friends.
This movie really proves it's point! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT!!!!",1401580800,,654,4.038461538461538

1574430,5,B00005JPNV,"With so many other reviews already written, I don't see a need to recount the plot. However, I will express my astonishment at the 32% low rating that this film received at the hands of the (journalistic?) critics as compiled and displayed at Rotten Tomatoes (RT). My thought is that many of the critics just don't share the same values of the majority audience. The RT audience ratings however, like those of the Amazon reviews, were much higher than those of the professional 'revieIwers'. Also unfortunate is the follow-on story that one or more people from the Stanford Group, the film's producer, were arrested for financial fraud. (See Wikipedia's entry on Stanford Financial Group). The film is a fun family film; it gives food for thought; it contains life-enhancing principles. Kudos to the author and acting team for coming up with this story. If 'Jason', the film's protagonist, would ever want to know about some of the interesting projects which I have in mind .... well, please write!",1400716800,,998,4.946428571428571

1574479,5,B00005JPNV,"A very strong life lesson to be learned from this story. One that is needed very much today. Even though the movie is predictable from the beginning, you still want to see how it reaches each of those conclusions. Although only in supporting rolls, it is a joy to watch Brian Kieth, James Garner, Bill Cobbs and Lee Merriweather. The backstories/flashbacks were such an integral part of the story and the narration was well done. As much as they want Jason (Drew Fuller) to be one of the two stars of the movie, It is obvious that Emily (Abigail Breslin) walks away with that sole distinction.",1400112000,,593,4.60377358490566

This movie is a counter-cultural way of looking at what truly are good gifts to give to those we love. The movie is funny, tugs at your heart, a little unbelievable and yet is a good story.

The 'gifts' that were given during the trials were a series of challenges to be met in which the grandson would earn interim rewards and also accomplish some very important life tasks.
The main characters were very believable in their roles.
It became apparent during the times of challenge that a transformation took place in the grandson and that he began to demonstrate some of the responsible behaviors that the grandfather was hoping for by the end of the movie.

1574997,5,B00005JPNV,"This movie moves along very quickly and before you know it it's over.  The story line is great along with the actor's ability to keep your interest and gets you emotionally involved.  In the world today where many people have the attitude of ""what's in it for me""; these people can really learn some valuable lessons of what life is really about!  The follow-on movie made which is ""The Ultimate Life"" takes you through the grandfather's life of what he went through and how his changes influenced this story ""The Ultimate Gift"".  I would highly recommend though if you are considering this movie, definitely buy it, you won't be sorry; but also watch this movie before it's follow-on ""The Ultimate Life"".  I would recommend this movie for at least all young people (going to junior high and high school to watch), they just may learn something!  And for adults, who hadn't seen this movie, it's a winner in my eyes because your never too old to learn and make changes for the better in yourself and for those you touch!",1393027200,2,1020,4.638888888888889

1575741,5,B00005JPNV,The video the Ultimate Gift was received in a good amount of time. The video was shown at my church and I thought it was worth sharing. I would recommend for everyone.,1388707200,,167,4.25
1575742,5,B00005JPNV,"This movie is a tear jerker (have the tissues close by), but it is very worth the watching.  A young man who has had everything is forced to undergo some rethinking of his status (including loss of money and possessions), and grows through the experience.  He realizes what is important in life.

This was delivered on time and I will consider purchasing from this seller again.",1388707200,,378,4.696969696969697
1575743,5,B00005JPNV,I highly recommend this movie.  It took a young man who only thought of himself and made him a man who thought of others.  It is a very very good movie.

1575745,5,B00005JPNV,"It was a great movie. I've watched it on Television several times, but commercials have taken away parts of the movie that should have been left in. It just shows that a boy that has everything, can still learn to become a decent human being and grow into a responsible ma - Drew Fuller was great. I've always liked James Garner, who played the Grandfather that left a Will in the form of a video - just for Jason (Drew Fuller) to see.

Abigail Bresslin is great as a little girl confronted with dying. She's more concerned with leaving her mom behind, than dying herself. Abigail has been a great actress from the very beginning. The lady playing her mother (don't know her name) was great too.

It's definitely a chick-flick, but it's also a good movie.",1388620800,,755,4.5036496350364965

1575825,4,B00005JPNV,"The movie has many life lessons that reflect many family dynamics.  The family Patriarch (James Garner) was able to transfer to his Grandson much more than his wealth.

1575925,5,B00005JPNV,"I am moved by the story of the characters portrayed in this movie.  The young man, who has lived his entire life as a self-centered, spoiled, insensitive brat.  The little girl who has lived her few years as a strong, caring, sensitive & confident individual, who is wise way beyond her years.  And the mother, who has to face & endure hardship that many of us have never & hopefully will never have to go through.  She goes from struggling to deal with her child's illness & the hardships that go along with it on her own, to trusting someone else to stand by her side & give her the love & support she desperately needs.

If not, this movie will challenge you in ways you'd never expect by taking you on a journey along with Jason after the passing of his grandfather. Jason's grandfather uniquely passes on life lessons to his grandson that challenge Jason to his core and ultimately lead him to 'the ultimate gift.' This movie was well written and was an unexpected delight that has become one of my family's favorites. We love it so much that we try to watch this movie a minimum of once a year to remind us of what is really important in life. If you haven't seen ""The Ultimate Gift,"" you're truly missing out on a good, family-quality movie.",1387411200,,748,4.58955223880597
1576017,5,B00005JPNV,"Both the acting and videography is superb for what I expected to be more of a low-budget film. It was a pleasant surprise.

We watch this with our kids as a reminder of certain values that we hope they will adopt (and they we hope to adopt in our own lives). The story is engaging, and the kids (age 3 and up) stay riveted pretty much the whole time. There are some great comedic  and poignant moments as well.

Brief overview:
Rich Man dies and in his will divides his estate amongst his overly vain posterity with the greatest portion being reserved for a wayward grandson who must pass a series of tests to receive it. These tests are designed to build his character in such a way that by the time he receives the money he will be the kind of man who will use it nobly. This becomes the ultimate gift, not the money, but the hard-earned life lessons.",1387411200,,853,4.285714285714286

Nothing really bad or unwholesome, but it does have a PG rating for a short violent scene and one angry outburst.  It has a great story. And I'm a James Garner fan from way back, so that was a plus for me. Families should watch together so parents can answer any questions younger kids may have.

Each part of the movie can be paused and then my students (4th - 6th graders) are given a task from the book that goes with that section of the movie and they complete the task at home by themselves.  Then a week later we talk about how their ""gift"" made the recipient feel and then we would watch another part of the movie and do the next ""gift"".

One year my students got really involved in this movie that they started a club at recess time where they held meetings with students from other grades and classrooms and shared the nice things they all did for others.  They even made little badges and gave them as rewards to the members who helped others.  The local News came and did a story on their projects and internet sites that they set up.  It was really neat.

Each year we start collecting money for 2-3 charities that the students vote on and have competitions to see which charity can raise the most money in a month.

Bravo to the screenwriter who took the ideas from the sappy little book of the same name and turned them into a movie with depth, humor, and pathos, and to the actors who produced believable characters with great chemistry.

I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  A family member recommended it and I purchased the DVD and have watched it multiple times and even bought for other family members.  I like movies where I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  This was an amazing movie

Jason is rich, arrogant and has never had to work for anything in his life.  He and his family are anything but close and he has also had a strong, deep anger toward his grandfather since his childhood when his father died.  Life was never the same since then, but Jason's grandfather, Red, wants to help his grandson more than anything else and so when he dies, in his will gives Jason the opportunity to gain ""The Ultimate Gift"" of life lessons which lead him to a more positive perspective on life, love, family and forgiveness.  The story kept you interested the whole way through and you get involved and treasure the relationships that are developed and the lessons learned.

The drive and ability to change not only your own life direction; but influencing another who could not possibly reach their dream without an investment of love, time and sellish sacrifice to the greatest degree was all coupled together.  This movie has affected my life and thinking.  The young man of which I share about was this person who was challenged to chage completely trusting an inward drive to succeed.

His grandfather left a set of videos for Jason to watch and if Jason will do a set of tasks his grandfather promises via the videos to give Jason the ultimate gift.

I have one problem with the movie.  If the grandfather was wise enough to make a set of videos before his death which helped Jason become a better person, why couldn't the grandfather have done a better job with his own children?

1577836,5,B00005JPNV,"The Ultimate Gift is a 2006 film directed by Michael Sajbel and based on a novel of the same name by Jim Stovall. The plot involves a rich young man named Jason Stevens who undergoes an obstacle course set up by his dead grandfather, Ray Stevens. If he jumps through all the hoops properly, he will get his share of the inheritance. The Stevens are a spoiled, sophisticated family known for their extravagant and fashionable livestyles. Like Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind, they don't know how good they've got it. Most of them (particulary Jason's two uncles) are rude, pathetic, arrogant, annoying and discontent. Some of their familes have serious marital and moral problems but it's always difficult to feel sorry for sinners when they live in lavish mansions.

Mr. Ray Stevens has just so arranged that all Jason's luxuries are taken away so he will learn the value of work. While Jason is on the streets, he meets a single mother named Alexia who is struggling to pay the doctor's bills for her sickly daughter Emily. For the first time, Jason feels sorry for someone besides himself and endeavours to help them.

Drew Fuller (Jason) does an excellent job showing the gradual transformation from a rude, self-centered punk to a mature, thoughtful and well-mannered gentleman. Brian Dennehy is also eye-catching in a small supporting role as a cowboy. The rest of the cast, on the other hand, just seem to be doing their jobs. The only actor I can think of who stands out like a sore thumb is Abigail Breslin (Emily), who seems to say her lines in an awkward, machine-line tone. James Garner doesn't have much to do, since his role is a cameo. He is just such a big iconic name so Hollywood figured having him in this movie would draw the masses to the theaters.

The dialogue is occasionally a bit clunky (Would Jason's uncle really threaten his lawyer on him simply for not telling him about his inheritance?) and some of the sequence of events could have been better explained (Why did the policeman take Jason away from the resturaunt when he was watching his former girlfriend warm up to another man?) but I give the movie five stars simply because I feel like it has a potentially great story to work with.

For all of it's faults (mainly average, unexceptional performances and occasionally trite lines) The Ultimate Gift is one of the better of the ""Hallmark"" values films, due to it's great messages of self-sacrifice, courage and friendship.

1577930,2,B00005JPNV,"I've been watching a large number of Hallmark Christmas movies already this year, some wonderful and some not so great.  This one, unfortunately, falls in the latter category, and I have to say it struck me as a very odd choice to be included with a marathon of Christmas stories.  This is not to say that all Christmas movies should be light and fluffy and feel good--one of the greatest of all time, Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is hardly a barrel of laughs for a good bit of the picture, but has stood the test of time. The two stars I've given it pertain mainly to members of the terrific cast--Abigail Breslin, Ali Hillis, Brian Dennehy, a still radiant Lee Meriwether, and of course, James Garner.  Their efforts should be applauded--but they struggled valiantly in the face of a one-note performance by Drew Fuller, who also seems to have only one facial expression.  Also, the story left me cold and seemed to wander all over the place; the love story between Fuller and Hillis was not convincing, nor was the ""friendship"" between Fuller and Breslin-- and as for the sudden shift to a drug war in South America, please!  Will not be watching this again--there are far too many great ones out there.",1352678400,,1209,4.630841121495327

The acting and script are first rate. There is humor, excitement, drama and enchantment that will tap into all your emotions and tug your heart strings.

Jason Stevens receives a series of gifts that challenge, motivate and finally change him. ""I am so proud of the man you have become."" (says the attorney.) Brian Dennehy has a memorable performance in the beginning as the quiet Texan who says a lot with very few words. You will meet his greedy family and finally the young woman who wins his heart. ""My wish? My wish is the perfect day and I am just finishing it""

This move will hold your attention, has great life morals that James Gardner explains so well ""That thing you're holding is called a PAYCHECK. As much as you need it for yourself, give it to someone who really needs it."" or ""Do you really know what it is to learn?...even if pain is your teacher.""

1578176,4,B00005JPNV,"I had no real pre-conceived notions before watching this and haven't read the book.

This movie clearly has as a chief goal to cause people to think about what they are doing with their life.  And at that I would say it succeeds.

The story itself was entertaining and interesting and generally ""feel good"" (though you may cry...), but is under-developed. It needed at least another 15 minutes to flesh out some of the relationships. Out of the blue the main character Jason (who is initially a spoiled brat) becomes friends with this little girl and her mom and yet there is very little screen time to showing this emotional connection developing. It seems like out of the blue, he is hugging and kissing the little girl and her mom - like they've known each other for a long time when really they just met. It just seemed awkward to me - something I wasn't prepared for emotionally because the movie didn't prep me for it. I kept feeling like this movie was playing with my emotions on a level at which I wasn't prepared for. It felt like the movie was missing 15-30 minutes of film that was needed to fill in more of the back-story of the development of Jason and his transformation that was occurring.  A little more time with the guy on the ranch, a little more time fleshing out what happened in Ecuador, etc. would have been good - everything just seemed to jump way too quickly.  More time to really show the transformation and make a really cohesive story probably would have been appropriate.

Then there's the little girl that's constantly portrayed like a super-mature adult and thinking only of others, etc.  Nice sentiment, but pretty unrealistic.  Her character was a bit too ""over the top"" in my opinion - she needed to be a little more like a little girl and a little less like a 70-year-old woman that has a mature outlook on life given all the wisdom attained in her life.

Although some I guess are criticizing this film as an ""overtly Christian film"" - I think it is a VERY big stretch to call this film ""overtly Christian"" and probably even a stretch to reference it as ""Christian""!  Yeah, it mentions Jesus by name in a passing reference.  Yes, there are a few references to church.  Yes, there's a few songs playing that have Christian connotations.  And that's about it, folks.  There's very little preaching here.  The message of the movie pretty much boils down to ""live life to its fullness and care about others"", NOT ""accept Jesus Christ as your Savior"".  Personally as a Christian, I would have liked to have seen much greater emphasis on some of the spiritual dynamics.  This film doesn't really go there, so I don't understand criticisms along this line at all.

All in all, this was a somewhat contrived, under-developed, emotionally-manipulative film, but it was very entertaining and succeeds in its core goal on getting a person to really think a bit about what they are doing with the gift of life they've been given.

1578275,3,B00005JPNV,"Some spoilers coming up:

The movie seemed too long, and it never addressed the devastation caused by the death of a child. The way it threw in god and Jesus made me think it was produced by an evangelical church.

A mother's little girl dies, and the mother is simply inspired by her billionaire boyfriend building a hospital--with a chapel, he had to add (hint, hint, you need to go to church if you want to get cured). Where is the reality of an emotionally destroyed parent?

I really liked the young girl character. She was fun to listen to, and one of my objections to the movie plot was killing her off. We don't care how much fear and tension is in a movie or novel, but we want the good guys to win. Even in page-turners where a lot of good guys get killed, we want a happy or at least satisfying ending. This movie attempted the satisfying ending with the flight of a butterfly (supposedly the girl's spirit.

If they wanted a religious theme, then have the girl saved by a miracle. How about the boyfriend trying to decide whether to invest in some polluting industry or basic cancer research. He finally decides on basic research, and a discovery made and the girl is cured!

Also, that hooky statue of Jesus was a bit much. In fact, that whole scene was a heavy handed nod to born-again Christians.

The ancient Greek Thucydides in his ""History of the Peloponnesian Wars"" said of the plague in Athens: ""As for the gods, it seemed one and the same whether you worshiped them or not, when you saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately."" If a novel or movie about the death of a child doesn't address this issue, then it's just cotton candy for the mind.",1301184000,3,1670,4.423452768729642

1578279,5,B00005JPNV,"I see that lots of people refer to this as a ""Christian"" movie but frankly, I think that does it a disservice.  When I see Christian movie, I'm waiting for preachy and lots of ""have you been saved"" and generally won't bother with it.  This movie is hardly in that vein, there's a couple of scenes in a hospital chapel that are very well done and just affirm a belief in God by the characters - that's it, nothing even close to evangelical hysteria.

Mostly it's an entertaining and heart warming movie that the whole family can enjoy.  Like so many PG and PG-13 movies, the producers and directors have to actually work on the plot and acting to make the movie good versus relying on gratuitous sex and violence in R rated movies.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I find most family rated movies far better done than the trash that gets put out for those over 17.

First off, let me assure you, it isn't a 'Christmas'-themed movie, so don't avoid it if you fear it will be laced with Holiday Carols and St. Nick...but it DOES have a spiritual message, reminiscent of Lloyd Douglas'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magnificent-Obsession/dp/B001ILTUL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magnificent Obsession</a>&nbsp;and the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pay-It-Forward/dp/B00005B4BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pay It Forward</a>, that if we can look past ourselves, and willingly risk everything for others, our lives, and those we touch, will be infinitely richer...and a powerhouse cast, headed by James Garner, Drew Fuller, and Abigail Breslin, 'deliver the goods' flawlessly!

Garner, seen only in 'video', is a deceased multimillionaire whose greedy offspring gather like vultures to take everything. Grandson Fuller is little better than the rest, but he legitimately has a reason for the chip on his shoulder; when he was a child, his father died working at a Garner third-world humanitarian project, and Fuller lost all interest in life, living a wastral existence, fired with hatred at the grandfather.

Garner leaves a mysterious video message for Fuller, that his inheritance will be given when he successfully completes a few tasks, supervised by family lawyer Hamilton (Bill Cobbs) and his secretary, Miss Hastings (Lee Meriweather). Grudgingly, Fuller agrees, and the actual adventure begins, as the young man learns life lessons on hard work and dedication (from Garner's lifelong friend, a rancher played by the terrific Brian Dennehy), and the value of true friends, from a dying girl (Breslin), and her courageous mother (Ali Hillis). Fuller learns, the hard way, that you can't 'fake' friendship, and about the love and hope both his father and grandfather offered the people in war-torn Equador, where his father died. Nearly losing his own life, he discovers the true values he'd so long ignored.

While the finale, the final chapter of the film, may seem a bit too fantastic, it ties up the storyline beautifully (reminding me a bit of the early Garner film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cash-McCall/dp/B001SV3LL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cash McCall</a>), and is so fabulous, you may, like me, just say ""Wow!""

There is nothing wrong about having an affluent lifestyle but do not be parasitical on your family and society.  I have known some rich parents who allow their children to be professional college students who earn degree after degree without getting a job or  contributing to the family's fortune.  One case I heard about is that one grownup child sold his deceased rich mom's expensive burial plot and exchange it for a cheaper one to bury her in it. Surprisingly, some wealthy young persons sell drugs which can be seen in the book titled Dorm Room Dealers: Drugs and the Privileges of Race and Class.  Enormous sense of entitlement in life can lead to an insatiable greed for money where no natural familial affection can thrive. It can take one generation to build a fortune and one generation to dismantle it. In relation to estate and legacy planning, I highly recommend this dvd for all families especially those who are wealthy because it can save them money, grief, disappointment and pain from their heirs if they actively apply the lessons in this movie.",1294704000,,1218,4.8647342995169085

1578451,5,B00005JPNV,"In The Ultimate Gift, Jason loses his estranged wealthy grandfather, Red. In Reds will he set up a plan that Jason has to go through a series of tasks that lead up to the ultimate gift that he will receive. Red set this up through a series of videos giving instructions of how to complete the tasks and then when Jason completes them he learns that each task helps him receive an intangible gift. Along the way Jason learns what it is like to truly live and love. Even though its a secular movie The Ultimate gift, shows two major examples of biblical principals: the first is shown by Red that they need to love their neighbors as themselves, and Jason finds that losing his life is to find it, but there are also some negative aspects of the movie.
 ""And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" Matthew 22:39. Red must have known this or understood this. He was a generous man, so much so that his family mocked him for it. When his family went to look for the bulk of his estate, the first place they looked was charities. Red knew that if it weren't for the help that he got then he wouldn't be where he was therefore he wanted to help others.
  ""Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."" Matthew 10:39. The second ""gift"" that Jason ""receives"" is the gift of friendship. What Jason doesn't know is that he then must lose everything to find out who his true friends are. Everything  including his penthouse and all of his money. While Jason didn't lose his life for Christ, he still lost his life. Of course, in losing everything he found the one person who didn't care that he was broke. He fell in love with a single mother, who's daughter had cancer. The daughter became the inspiration for what he wanted to do with the rest of his life.
 In this movie disrespect is a common sight. The children of the late Red, mock him when he about the good deeds he had done. They also were complaining about the multi-million inheritance that they received. The girl that had cancer, Emily, was disrespectful to everyone but the director tried to make it look cute. There was a few cuss words but nothing bad. Also Reds family held themselves to a high standard and thought that money was everything.
 Despite some of the negative elements The Ultimate Gift shows two important biblical principals very well. The first by Red, that you need to love your neighbors as yourself. Then by Jason that to lose your life is to find it. Overall a very good movie that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life.",1285027200,,2581,4.423157894736842

1578499,2,B00005JPNV,"Beware; Ultimate Spoilers lie ahead.

Someone (I won't say who) wanted me to watch this movie and give her a concise and honest review of it, but after I saw this film, I realized that my feelings about it were so strong, that I simply had to put them into words.

The movie begins innocently enough; with the death of a very wealthy and powerful man named Red Stevens.  His own family seems to attend his funeral as mainly a formality prior to the reading of his will; a will in which each receives nothing of much consequence; due to the fact that they would undoubtedly abuse the companies and riches that the dead man has spent his life building.

The depictions of the man's family are probably meant to evoke some sort of pity, because of their clear narcissism, greed, and tendency to talk about money to the exclusion of all else.  In short, these people are straw-men; stereotypes of rich, spoiled individuals with little or no depth invested in any of their personalities.

Since the family members are all background characters who don't get much screen time, I probably shouldn't be too upset by that, but this is also a film about one character who does eventually develop, so there's kind of a sense that they could have given these characters a bit of depth if they'd wanted to; they just didn't, because they were trying to make a point.

As if that point wasn't obvious enough, it's hammered in rather loudly by Hamilton; the seeming attorney of the dead tycoon.  Hamilton derides the family members for their character flaws, even while they're sitting right in front of him, though not directly to their faces, exactly.  I found myself wondering if Hamilton's comments to his secretary couldn't have taken place in the hallway, but it's a minor gripe in a film that deserves a much better effort.

The one person who does receive anything of any substance is a young man named Jason Stevens; a college grad-age boy, who is so unrealistically spoiled, that he goes to a graveyard and forgets there's a funeral within the first five minutes of the film.  I couldn't make that up if I tried.

Rather than being given cash or fancy businesses, however, Jason is given a series of missions to perform; missions which involve doing things like manual labor, having all of his stuff stolen, and making friends, and here is the part where the film is truly at it's best.  Between the eight minute mark, clear through to the end of the first half hour of the film, Jason learns all sorts of things that are worth learning, such as the value of work, the value of doing a job well, and who his friends really are, or to be more precise, who they aren't.

Without money or a place to live, Jason quickly learns that he has no real friends.  Even his family isn't allowed to help him by order of Hamilton, but he has to make a friend somehow, and here is the first major issue that the movie stumbles into, at the thirty-three minute mark, almost on the dot.  That's when Jason runs into his ""friend,"" a young girl who, we later find out, has a terrible illness, which I insist must be sunlight poisoning, because she is clearly some kind of vampire.

The little girl's name is Emily, and not only does she dress constantly in black, wear black lipstick, and carry an umbrella when there's no rain, but from her speech, mannerisms and the way she thinks, it's obvious that she is at least sixty.  She's like Fred Savage, except less sympathetic.

I absolutely refuse, however, to pin any of the blame for this character's enormously-grating personality on Abigail Breslan.  She did a good job depicting the character that she was given.  No, the fault lies with the character herself; with Emily.  Where there could have been the believable character of a sick, pitiable child, we instead get an aged philosopher, who flawlessly predicts people's actions for the benefit of her conniving schemes; schemes such as teaching Jason the true meaning of friendship, and hooking him up with her mother.  There is no time in this movie where she doesn't come across as a smaller, paler version of Guinan from Star Trek, and it's entirely the fault of whoever wrote her dialogue and role in the story.  Hands down, I would say that this is the worst thing about this movie; worth a whole star down by itself, because of its prominence in the movie from this point on.  The movie has other problems, but none that keep coming back again and again, like...  Well, like a terminal disease, if you'll forgive that.

So anyway, Jason succeeds in making friends with the wise Miyagi nosferatu, or at least, he pretends to at first.  Later, he really does make friends with her, visiting her in the hospital, and helping her out as best he can, which isn't easy, since he has very little money, and she never seems to shoot him so much as a hopeful smile.  Vampires can't be good to others, you know.

Upon receiving his most recent instructions, and returning to the hospital, Jason finds Master Yoda's room empty, except for a very, very cruel nurse, who tells him that she's ""with the lord now.""  In the next scene, he enters a chapel and there she is.  Oh!  Ha ha ha!  I get it.  I'll bet she pulls that trick every week with somebody; fools them into thinking their friends and relatives are dead, then it really turns out she was kidding.  Ha ha HA!  Seriously, though; this nurse should be fired.

In the chapel (yes, vampires can walk on holy ground.  In fact, they need to sleep in it,) Jason and Obi-Wan discuss why she's so darn messed up in the head.  Apparently, having a terminal disease makes you age fifty years, although they do skip over the part about her being undead.  Presumably, some secrets are just too personal.

In the very next scene, Jason meets with Master Splinter's mom, who seems not to have learned her daughter's wisdom, though she does make up for it by crying very unconvincingly on three separate occasions.  In one scene, she's even facing away from the camera, and it's still impossible to mistake her performance for real crying, because of the fact that she overplays it so darn much.

Well, anyway, Jason and the mother get into a very shoehorned relationship, which didn't need to happen, and takes away from the movie at just about every stage.  Nothing about her presence in this part of the movie is necessary or pleasant, as she more or less sits uncomfortably at the dinner table of Jason's family on thanksgiving, doing and saying next to nothing of any substance.  Once again, Jason's family get to revel in their nature as stereotypes before Jason is sent on his next mission; go to a third world country for some charity work in a library.

While Jason is in that third world country, he convinces a guide to help him find information about what happened to his father, though the guide is reluctant, because doing so involves going into ""drug lord territory.""  Sure enough, they haven't been there for five minutes, when they're assaulted by drug lords, who, just like real drug lords, are a small gang of guys in the middle of a jungle, with basic guns, who all dress like Indiana Jones, and don't seem to have any house, village, or anything to live in.  Sure.

Anyway, the budget drug lords keep Jason and the guide prisoner, make fun of them on Christmas just to be jerks, then threaten to kill them the next day, because, presumably, a dead hostage is far more valuable than a living one.  Fortunately, though, they fail, and Jason and the guide escape, thanks to a conveniently-unlocked door.  They then decide that with miles and miles of jungle all around them, their best chance of escaping from people with guns is to run through an open fiend, with no cover more significant than two-foot-high grass.

Of course, in order to justify his trip to a third world country, and as such, the whole dead father subplot, Jason must bring back something from his travels, and sure enough...  It's a doll for Master Genkai.  How sweet.  That's one neck she can afford to bite.

Of course, because we definitely haven't had enough of the lame relationship subplot, Jason must take Rafiki and her mother to a ranch that he worked on earlier in the movie, for a romantic interlude having nothing whatsoever to do with the main redemption plot.  However, while he's there, he's challenged by the videos of his dead grandfather to find a dream to fulfill with his life.  Jason then receives a sum of one hundred million, and decides to use it as the first third of the money needed for building a home in honor of his friend; Shifu.  A home which will, he says, take care of ""a dozen or more families.""

Now, I admit that I have never built a home to care for a dozen or more families, and the economy is very bad right now, and likely to get worse, but it seems to me that three hundred million is enough to take very good care of over fifty to a hundred families for the rest of their lives, even once you factor in the construction costs.  Blowing all that cash on a few dozen people made less sense, to me, than most of the things going on here.  I mean, couldn't he just found a new hospital or something?  Some of the big ones admit loads and loads of patients at a time.  I know things are bad for medicine now that the government's devouring the medical profession, but Jason's plan hardly seems cost effective to me.

Anyway, cost effective or not, it seems to win over Hamilton, who gives Jason the rest of his grandfather's money; a large, large sum.  He becomes rich and powerful, and decides to do right by the people of the world, and is free to (presumably) marry the mother of his young friend.  The only problem is that Gandalf dies of her terminal illness, though I'm sure she'll come back at the turn of the tide, or the next time full moonlight hits her remains.

I want to go on record right here, however, as saying that I found this movie only half bad, but in a way, that's why it hurt so much to watch it.  It's obvious that this film was built around the skeleton of a story that was very solid.  It's just that for whatever reason, that skeleton had rotten bits all over it, and was generally picked clean.

I like the movie's message, the plot and the fact that Jason really does get a lot of money at the end (teaching us all that sometimes, what we need really is what we want, just not for the same reasons,) but there was just too much garbage piled onto this story by whoever assembled, wrote and/or directed it.  Too many unnecessary movie elements were inserted where they weren't needed.  The unnaturally-wise nature of Emily, the romance with the mother, and the whole dead father subplot spring to my mind as being things that could easily have been cut from the movie, and replaced with something more substantial, like some more scenes of Jason learning lessons or something.  I also have no problem with the religious and spiritual elements of the film, though like everything else, it could have used another spoonful of subtlety.

In the end, this is a bad movie, but it feels like the kind of bad movie that was based on something good.  Apparently, it's actually based on a book, in fact.  I haven't read the book myself, but I know someone who has, and she really enjoyed it, so why not read that instead of watching this?  The Ultimate Gift is one awesome concept after another, stumbled over clumsily, as though in the desire to appeal to a demographic, rather than to be a quality film, and that kind of approach never, ever, ever ends well.",1274140800,7,11530,4.545762711864406

Make them watch it with you and create a plan of positive change, a path of giving and non-monetary rewards.  My pre-teen and teenager love it and even got emotional (yeah, teenagers have a heart!).

This is one excellent movie!  The soundtrack is extremely good, well written and performed (including Sarah Groves).  The plot was rich (no pun intended).  Will watch this again, and heartily endorse it to friends and family.  OK for kids to watch, so long as they are familiar with death (it happens).  Miss Breslin is of course her usual amazing actress self.  James Garner is exactly what you would expect - an excellent actor giving another great performance.  The lead Drew Fuller, is a relative newcomer, and improves as you keep watching.  Miss America 1955 (Lee Meriweather) gives a solid performance as does Mr. Garner's assistant - Bill Cobbs(can't wait top see him in something else).  Go for it!",1260316800,,875,4.910958904109589

The uncle was a self made man who in his older years realized his own parenting mistakes and was trying to correct them in the next generation.  The story is thought provoking and very inspiring.  I LOVE the story line.

I did read the book before seeing the movie and this is one I felt the book was much better than the movie.  I was a bit disappointed in the movie actually, from reading the book first.  There were stories and lessons and examples in the book that the movie left out, and the book was able to better portray what was happening in the thought and heart of the nephew.

I did NOT like how the little girl Emily was cast at all!  I didn't like the very obvious makeup job on a little girl.  While Emily gave a very sacrifical precious gift to her mother that was powerful, the rest of the movie she cops alot of attitude that doesn't really line up with the powerful gift she gave her mom.  She was portayed with a lot of adult sarcasm, and jadedness.  It's hard NOT to feel drawn to a dying child, but it was very difficult to feel drawn to how they portrayed this child.

1579002,5,B00005JPNV,"Jason Stevens has lived all his life pampered, with money as available to him as water or air. He believes that his grandfather (Red Stevens) has destroyed his life and has a serious grudge upon him. He makes a disrespectful entrance to Red's funeral and lazily shows up at the reading of the will expecting to get nothing. However, he is presented with a video of Red telling him that he will have to go through a series of {12} ""gifts"" to get ""The Ultimate Gift"". With some persuading of his greedy girlfriend, the start of Jason's journey begins, at first toward his only goal-the money.

Jason meets Emily, a leukemia-stricken girl with a big heart and a smart mouth, and slowly becomes friends with her. She intuitively helps him through the increasingly difficult challenges. The ""gifts"" slowly turn Jason from a pampered snob to a loving philanthropist.

This heart-wrenching movie is our appropriate wake-up call. Too many people in this world need some unraveling of their twisted, money-lusting souls by gifts such as Jason's. It is a wonderful film that the whole family can enjoy, with well-cast actors that make the movie subtle in atmosphere, and humor spread perfectly across the movie(love the part when Gus electrifies him with that cattle stick).

The story itself is OK, if not exactly great. It is one of those idealistic stories that really makes you think about yourself and what you find important, but the primary plot is not something that would take place in the real world. It is an emotional movie, and should bring watery eyes to anybody watching it.  Guys, gals, and older children should all enjoy this movie -- it did not appear targeted to any specific demographic, and had nothing in it which I considered objectionable.

At nearly two hours long, there are some things that were included in this film that could have been eliminated or shortened. The bench sequences never seemed to have complete closure -- so why include it? The ""gift of work"" sequence -- especially the post-hole digging --  was entirely too long. And although I have not read the book, and it is probably part of the original story, the whole ""prisoner"" sequence is completely out of place and totally unbelieveable -- a point at which I believe this film ""jumps the shark"".

1579139,5,B00005JPNV,"I did not expect to fall in love with this movie or cry my eyes out at the end.  This is a movie anyone can watch with anyone of any age and is a great family film.

Drew Fuller (Jason) does a fantastic job as a young rich man just coasting through life on his family's money.  His grandfather (James Garner) however, sees potential in Jason and decides leave him an unusual legacy - twelve tasks that form The Ultimate Gift.

These tasks are really virtues that Jason in the beginning, tries to skirt or just get through to get his inheritance. But as he progresses through each task/virtue, he sees a world beyond his penthouse and begins to connect with people and events that shake him to his core.

What is really endearing about this film is that there are elders and a young girl (fighting for her life) reaching out to help Jason find his way in life.  Some of the help comes in advice, but most of it comes from Jason using his intuition to help others.

This film is very emotional and remniscent of the Touched by an Angel series.  Only the angels in this story are every day people trying to find their way in life.

1579195,3,B00005JPNV,"I have a friend who recently watched Facing The Giants. I asked her what she thought - she said, ""It felt contrived."" That interested me because, the night before, I had watched The Ultimate Gift and felt the same way about it. Come to think of it, most modern-day Christian films seem contrived, from Time Changer to One Night With The King. (Amazing Grace and The Passion Of The Christ are obvious exceptions.) Why is that?

What is it about modern-day Christians that causes many of us to be attracted to stories that are contrived? Why are films being made for us by companies like Fox Faith that are not real, the way we supposedly say our faith is? Christian novels, such as The Shack, are alarmingly artificial; so are Christian children's books. Are we so shallow, unimaginative and inexperienced at life and art that we cannot do better than to fulfill the meaning of the word contrived: ""obviously planned or forced; artificial; strained?""

Does that say something about us and our faith?

This latest film from Fox Faith, the Christian production arm of Fox, is a great example. They say they are producing ""movies you can believe in."" In the case of The Ultimate Gift, I don't think so. I really wanted to like it, too, because it was highly rated on many web sites, was full of good actors, and had a basic concept by blind writer Jim Stovall that wasn't half-bad. But the script is bad.

When a writer - Cheryl McKay, in this case, working off Jim Stovall's book - is compelled to put adult language in the mouth of a child in order to make her seem cute - which happens in the case of Abigail Breslin, who plays Emily Rose - you know you're in trouble. I was sick of her adult-sounding cuteness by the end of the film. As a matter of fact, not only do the words not fit the character, but Breslin is way over-acting. She may have been good in Little Miss Sunshine and Nim's Island, but she is next to terrible here. Wearing dark lipstick and carrying an open, pink umbrella doesn't help either. I don't care if leukemia victims actually do those sorts of things, they did not make her character any more convincing or likable.

So, Breslin all but ruined the film for me. The only things that saved it were the performances by some of the other actors: the understated performance by Drew Fuller as Jason Stevens, the young man that is trying to earn his dead grandfather's inheritance by fulfilling a battery of quests; the outstanding job by Bill Cobbs as Mr. Theophillis Hamilton, Jason's grandfather's lawyer, partner and friend; and the elegant portrayal by Lee Meriwether of Miss Hastings, Mr. Hamilton's secretary. Other than a handful of typically solid character actors, such as Brian Dennehy, most of the rest of the cast is rather amateurish, and some are quite annoying. All the portrayals of ""Southerners"" are so stereotypical they're sickening.

The disappointing script and amateurish acting of the supporting cast, and especially the overacting of Abigail Breslin, speaks to the lack of experience of director Michael O. Sajbel. He only had five films under his belt when he took this one on, and his last was the embarrassingly unbiblical, adolescent film One Night With The King (2006). I will say one thing: The Ultimate Gift is an improvement over that piece of fluff. And something else: production company Dean River Productions has given the film some very strong production values. (They were also the ""hired guns"" on Billy Graham's The Climb and Bobby Jones: Stroke Of Genius.)

But what we're really talking about here is a glorified Hallmark film. This is TV fare, not theatrical. We don't expect much from made-for-TV movies; we do from theatrical ones. There is just no realistic substance to The Ultimate Gift, just as there was none in One Night With The King. Had these been fantasies, that would have been fine. But these are both realistic stories, and neither holds up under the most liberal scrutiny. While the very idea of fulfilling a series of quests in order to receive an inheritance is contrived, the film need not have been, had the characters been real people, rather than stereotypes; and had the script and film not been filled with so many cliches.

As with a person, substance is what makes a story good. Shallowness, lack of imagination, contrivance, stereotypes and cliches - these are the signs of a creative spirit that is anything but. It is folly for Christians to continue churning out books and movies of this sort. What they are doing is creating an image of Christians as superficial, artificial people because that is how our films and novels are. Someone with a godly, biblical standard and the vision to go with it needs to step up to the plate and start swinging. Is there anyone like that out there?

I can't help repeating CS Lewis' oft quoted take on Christian books and films: ""We don't need more people writing 'Christian books' [but] what we need is more Christians writing good books. - CS Lewis

Amen to that. It almost deserves an altar call.

There's a catch though - in order to receive his inheritance... to receive the ""Ultimate Gift..."" Jason must perform a series of tasks. To most this sounds reasonable, but to Jason, who has not only never worked a day in his life and has an ego the size of the Milky Way Galaxy, this task is so daunting at every step that he considers quitting on multiple occasions.

The most interesting aspect of this movie is not whether or not Jason
receives his inheritance, the Ultimate Gift, but rather whether or not we as the viewers receive our own metaphorical inheritance from this movie.

This is the task we are challenged with, but only in understanding and
becoming Jason can we understand the Ultimate Gift.",1213142400,,918,4.9480519480519485

Through a series of videos recorded before he died with the help of his wise old lawyer (superbly played by Bill Cobb), the dead Red Stevens sends Jason off on a series of tasks in order to merit what grandpa calls ""the ultimate gift"".

  Of course, Jason hates the deceased grandfather. In fact, everyone in the family hates everyone else to one degree or another.

  Jason starts off as a selfish, self-centered jerk, but you just know that grandpa will change him as a man and bring to understand the grandfather he hated and shunned.

  It takes litte Emily (fetching played by Abigail Breslin, a real sweetheart) and her single mom Alexia (Ali Hillis) to help the real Jason ultimtely shine through.

  Brian Denehy plays a small role and it was nice to see him onscreen again.

  Jason goes through some adventures on his way to manhood, all of which are contrived, but that's just the nature of things.

  Overall, the film ends up being a real tearjerker in spite of its weak, forumlaic opening. Gratifying in is own way and well worth the watching when you feel like seeing an upbeat film about the potentials of humanity.

Finally, when this rebel without cause and immature grandson will receive, will be a series of challenges he will have to surpass to earn the ultimate gift.

1579487,4,B00005JPNV,"Though the picture is simple, the message is clear. Sadly, we have to watch movies of great heart change and hear critics scoff at the thought. The truth of this movie flies in the face of such criticism by boldly proclaiming that change can take place. I don't think this movie will act as an agent of great change in the hearts of the movie's critics... but i do believe that it may encourage others who are already experiencing their own life redirections.

I won't discuss the dialogue nor the award-winning performances. Instead, I'll address the ""gifts"" mentioned in the movie. The critics who have frowned on this picture for its simplicity likely missed the point of the book turned movie: Learning life lessons is a gift. In my opinion, this is a quick cliffs-notes version of some simple life lessons. A movie that acts as a touchpoint to review how you may have learned these lessons.

Yes, the movie makers (and likely the writers before the strike) sought to gain some predictable emotional tugs in the movie. None the less, feeling such tugs are what make us human. This movie gives us the right to validate life gifts and encourage them in others.

I read the book several months ago and found it to be amazing.  I normally don't watch a lot of movies these days.  In this case, I'm glad that I did.  It is superb.

Whereas the focus of so much attention these days is on materialism, money, and 'stuff', this movie explores other areas that are much more important. It is centered around the will of billionaire Red Stevens (James Garner). He had spent his entire life providing every material pleasure desired by his much coddled relatives. He had concluded that most of them were too shallow to concern themselves with anything but money and things. He had a bit of hope for something more in his grandson, Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller). Rather than just giving him money or other assets, he decides to give him 'The Ultimate Gift'.

There are numerous pearls of wisdom in this movie that many know but some have never learned. Two of these are 'The Gift of Work' and 'The Gift of Problems'.

No they were not subtle yet they were worth watching. In this movie we start with a trust fund baby Jason who has spent his whole life as one big party. And upon the death of his grandfather he is given the opportunity to receive a series of gifts if he is willing to follow his late grandfathers instructions. His first choice is to accept these series of gifts or to walk away and forfeit his inheritance.

We watch Jason grow from a shallow man to the man of worth he could be. The cast of characters and how they were written is necessary to see the lessons and growth in such a short period that is afforded to us by a movie. This would be a great feature for the whole family. There is no question that this is a message film and a good one; a story of friendship, trust, values, respect, charity, loyalty and respect among others. Everyone who watches this movie will walk away learning something and I think it will be unique to the viewer.

Life itself is a gift that we have all been graced with. And we should each learn what each of our gifts are and then proceed to share what we are able too with others. It does remind you the true adage that money does not buy you happiness and that it is better to give than receive.

1579668,3,B00005JPNV,"For Christmas I gave myself the ultimate gift and watched the film everyone's been talking about in my neighborhood, the story of a rich boy who suddenly finds himself cut off without a dime by henchmen of his late grandfather (James Garner), so that even his car gets towed away while he watches, angry and ashamed.  That part I couldn't figure out, couldn't he just call the police?  In the US even your creditors can't simply siphon every penny out of your bank account, but then again maybe the government can and this is the film's way of showing that Texas oilman Red Stevens (the Garner role) is actually a top government official.  Garner plays him as though he was playing George Bush Sr, and even the makeup people seem in on the act, carefully blotching Garner's skin and rearranging his hairline to give him a striking resemblance to the former President.

The older man, Red, has never been forgiven by young Jason for reasons that remain shadowy through most of the story, emerging only when Jason goes to Ecuador and enjoys a multicultural romance with an attractive, if somewhat older, Ecuadorian librarian and human rights worker.  It seems that Jason's dad died under mysterious circumstances and all along Jason has been convinced that Red had something to do with it.  Why Red never told Jason the truth when he was alive I don't know.

Another muted romance is between Mr. Henderson, the ancient lawyer living on due to having received Red's kidney, and Lee Meriweather, the former Miss America and Catwoman on Batman, who makes a triumphant return to the big screen as Miss Hastings, his assistant or secretary or whatever she is.  The two of them are obviously in love, but maybe the interracial aspect of their romance was causing the producers some concern, so they share only some glowing, eerily lit closeups, and their heads are always photographed togetherthisclose like two petals on a daisy.

I wept buckets throughout the movie and anyone whose heart isn't made out of stone will do the same.  I dock the movie several notches because of its abysmal photography, like a cheesy featurette on a Balkan TV channel of the 60s; the limp Rob Lowe wannabe Drew Fuller playing the lead in a dreadful performance based totally on his hair; and also of course, the message about worship which is tacked on to what was otherwise a movie all about wealth, poverty, family and disease.",1198972800,4,2404,4.785024154589372

Jason Stevens (the un-charismatic Drew Fuller) is a spoiled, ne'er-do-well rich kid who learns the ""true meaning of life"" from his dead, zillionaire grandfather (the venerable James Garner) who has set up a series of values-instilling ""tests"" for the young man to pass before he can receive the hundred-million-dollar inheritance that has been earmarked for him in the old codger's will.  In the heavily contrived screenplay, childhood leukemia, Latin American rebels and a bevy of overly-caricatured elitist snobs all get thrown into the mix - and not only is it all supposed to somehow fit together, but it's clear we're intended to get something worthwhile and meaningful out of the whole shebang as well.  Actually, you'll probably find yourself wanting to throttle most of the characters in the movie, particularly the condescending, control-freak of a dead man (even from beyond the grave, he instructs Jason on how to live his life via videotapes he recorded before his death) and the two benignly smug partners he's instructed to carry on the business of soul-restoration in his absence.  Even Abigail Breslin, of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" fame, ultimately sets the teeth on edge with her too-cutesy-by-half impersonation of a dying child.

And just in case you somehow managed to miss the message that they have been pounding into your skull for nigh unto two full hours at this point, the filmmakers thoughtfully provide a recap of each of Jason's ""gifts"" as part of the closing credits.

""The Ultimate Gift"" is one of those movies that exists solely to reduce its audience to a quivering mass of throat lumps and tears while making them feel good about themselves and the world around them at the same time.  Unfortunately, it has all the grit and depth of one of those Hallmark Hall of Fame Christmas-miracle tales that crop up on TV with alarming regularity every holiday season.  Forget the Kleenex and pass out the insulin-filled syringes instead.",1198281600,8,2273,5.05614973262032

1579709,4,B00005JPNV,"The Ultimate Gift is a charming movie released by Fox Faith that utilizes a great cast to present sweet story. Red Stevens is ridiculously wealthy and has just died. It seems no one in his family cares for anything except how big their inheritence will be. Grandson Jason (Drew Fuller) certainly doesn't expect anything from the grandfather he blames for his father's desk. Red's lawyers, played wonderfully by Bill Cobbs and Lee Merriwether, call Jason in. Red (James Garner) has a video message for Jason. If Jason follows Red's instructions, he will receive several little gifts that will lead to the ""Ultimate Gift""

Jason is a slacker and at first is against playing these silly games. He goes along reluctantly and soon learns the value of ""work"" and ""money"" through hard life lessions. Along the way, he meets Alexia, the single mom of Emily (played by Abigal Breslin).

Since I wanted to enjoy this movie, I was able to overlook some of its flaws, like how a relationship between Alexia and Jason developed out of the blue. Or how, while homeless, Jason always seemed clean shaven. Or how the lessons that Jason should have learned from each gift seemed implied. In fact, the story does seem choppy at times, with the story coming in segments that don't quite flow together.

In spite of its flaws, I enjoyed the movie. It is based on the book of the same name by Jim Stovall. This is a movie with a message, be prepared. However, the message isn't religious or ""Christian"", nor does it pound you over the head. This movie is like a Hallmark version of Brewster's Million, where Jason Stephens must change his behavior in order to inherit a large sum of money. This is a great family film, perhaps a bit slow for the kids. It got plenty of bad reviews from the secular media. Some criticized the filmmaking and acting, but just as many criticized the corniness of the message. And that shows why the intolerant mainstream media just doesn't get it. This was a good film. If you enjoyed it, be sure to check on the Jim Stovall novel or the movie novellization by Rene Gutteridge.",1197590400,,2086,4.663043478260869

Add those together and the money may follow but - even if it doesn't - those other qualities are what constitutes a legacy from generation to generation.

The movie evokes a Hallmark Movie of the Week Special, and I don't mean that as a criticism.  There is little overtly Christian in the film.  There are a few oblique references to heaven and a few scenes of the characters sitting in a hospital chapel; nothing that is in your face, though.

1579792,5,B00005JPNV,"The Ultimate Gift is thoughtful and entertaining while addressing one of humanities greatest faults: exclusive self interest and pride.  You'll not be bored by the seemingly under-budget nature of similar movies that are long on virtue and short on dollars.  The movie is well produced and the team of actors highly professional.

Jason, the lead character of the film is, like most of us, occupied with his own exclusive pursuits.  Fulfilling his own passions is what life is all about.  The opportunity to inherit a large estate peaks his interests and he is challenged and subjected to the will of another.  This is strange territory for him but something, even if its only the lure of great wealth, holds his attentions as he embarks on the journey to receive his Ultimate Gift.

The remainder of the movie catalogues the journey of a young man once in love with his own need to thrive and play.  Through the journey he learns what we must all learn.  Our lives mean nothing and will count as very little until we learn to give ourselves in service and develop a mindset that places value and equality on every human being we encounter.

If we could each learn the secret of this gift there'd be nothing to report on the evening news but what good we had all done for each other.  Its no exaggeration that our problems of homelessness, health care and hunger would all be solved.

This concept and the film are based on the lives and principles of the saints and servants of humanity that gave themselves so others would live in receipt of their Ultimate Gift: self sacrifice.",1195344000,2,1580,4.664259927797834

1579800,5,B00005JPNV,"Do you need a little wake up call about the meaning of life? Are you looking for a movie that pulls you in and makes you stop and think yet entertains you with laughter and tears at the same time? If the answer is yes, then pick up this pleasant surprise of a movie.

The premise of The Ultimate Gift (based on Jim Stovall's book by the same title) is a snotty rich kids expects to inherit millions from his Grandfather to continue with his limitless cashflow of a life he's lived thus far. Boy is he in for a surprise. The film begins with a billionaire's death. His more than superficous, obnoxious relatives all come in for the reading of the will. Of course, no one is pleased with the reading. The main character, grandson, Jason Stevens, is no exception. The billionaire,  aptly played by James Garner,  has left Jason a peculiar gift. A series of gifts actually, via video tape and delivered through his longtime lawyer and friend Ted Hamilton, played by Bill Cobbs. Jason Stevens must successfully complete all requirements of each ""test"" to get each gift, without knowing what he gets each time he is successful and always with the threat that if he blows it, everything is lost.

Jason's world is literally turned upside down with each new gift as everything is literally taken away from him--his money, his friends, his car, his home, his dignity and even his freedom.

Not since The Christmas Carol, has a story successfully engaged its viewers in such a journey. Screenwriting newcomer Cheryl McKay does a beautiful job adapting Jim Stovall's brilliant tale. An enhancement to the already great book was McKay's expansion of the ""one true friend"" little girl character Emily, played by Abigail Breslin. In the film version of Ultimate Gift, Emily is a major storyline which worked well for the big screen. Certainly director Michael Sajbel deserves credit and mention for the well done adaptation as well.

I thoroughly enjoyed the casting as well, especially James Garner, Bill Cobbs and Lee Meriwether. If you've ever been spoiled, taken your life for granted, felt broke, been disenchanted about your life, been unappreciative, or just had one of those days, grab a tissue and watch The Ultimate Gift. You'll get your life back into perspective.",1193875200,2,2261,4.829457364341085

I watched the movie because a friend recommended it and Abigail Breslin, the child star in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" was part of the cast.  Drew Fuller as the lead played a very believable Jason, a young man who thought his inheritance was going to be the gift of much money. This excellent movie is based on the best-selling book ""The Ultimate Gift"" by Jim Stovall.  Jason goes through several challenges his rich grandfather, Red Stevens, sets up through a partner and loyal friend, Ted Hamilton, played by Bill Cobbs.  The perennial question of whether money buys happiness is thoughtfully posed in several relationships Jason has when people close to him think he is broke.  His gold-digging girlfriend, aloof mother, alpha male uncles, show what they value.  Jason then meets a young woman with a child when he needs to find a true friend as one of the challenges his grandfather requires.  The child is Abigail Beslin, who, as Emily, both tugs your heart strings and makes you laugh.

Jason's Grandfather, Red, leaves several videotapes, depending on the challenge Jason solved.  Over the course of the challenges, Jason changes and sees life through new and deep meaning.  He becomes a better man.  Red left Jason two gifts, and the most important was not money.  ""The Ultimate Gift"" is a lesson on what matters.",1193097600,3,1449,4.845528455284553

[Plot points to be revealed in the following discussion.]

The opening scene shows a mother & daughter at the rainy graveside of billionaire James Garner.  Why are they there?  Apparently because his name is on the wing of the hospital where the daughter is being treated for leukemia.  Oh yes?  Would any mother take her critically ill daughter to a funeral of a stranger?  And even if she wanted to, viewings may be open to the public but surely a billionaire's graveside ceremony is reserved for family members and invited guests.

Do waiters gush ""Oh sir, most of our patrons find this wine too expensive!""  ?? Only in creaking scripts like this.

In short, the writer had no idea how to illustrate & move along his story so it's full of lame scenes.  How is it that someone who has a trust fund can overnight become homeless?  By what mechanism was his bank account emptied out?  Are we really to believe that shallow jet-setters have no one who will put them oup for the night if they are abruptly ejected from their condo?

The list of life-doesn't-work-that-way scenes clunk's along with slow moving, artless direction.  And why does the little girl wear ghoulish purple lipstick?

Apparently those who praised this movie are willing to accept any tripe  as long as there's no sex or violence. (Boobs & shootouts are offensive while a plot with the gratuitous death of a child is ""inspiring."")  Not for me.

This movie is definitely worthy of having... and is becoming a movement.  Other reviewers have described portions in depth, but my point in commenting is that the process of transformation of young Jason Stevens when faced with the different challenges is something the world needs to hear.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Red Stevens (portrayed by James Garner) is talking about the Gift of Problems in his video will.  He says that we should view problems as gifts that help us learn to grow and learn life, gifts that bring us to a newer knowledge of operating (my words, not his).  In this day, problems are more often viewed by many as a defeat rather than a lesson.

What a great movie.  I tell you it's just so nice to watch a film that you can even watch with the whole family. A movie where you can find things that you can personally draw from and think to yourself, ""Hey I can work on that with myself.. "", or ""Yes, I should be doing that.""

This story involves a rich self absorbed young guy, who has pretty much never had to work and always had everything he wanted. His friends basically only liked him because of his money and he never really had any true friendships or goals or dreams.  After the death of his grandfather and the process of the execution of his will, the character, Jason, has different tasks he must complete before he can receive the ""gift"" at the end, which he doesn't know what it is until they they have not just been ""done"" in a real sense, but also done to the point where Jason has really turned his life around and realized the true sense of so many things.

Abigails character and her mom come into his life and really help Jason to start thinking about others for the first time in his life.  I loved Abigails previous acting roles so to find her in this movie was a clincher that I had to see it.  The actors in the movie have been around for a while, but not enough to the point where they are typecast at all and the mixture was just like having a fresh new set of actors in a story.

All blended together, this is a perfectly delightful film that you will absolutely treasure.  The title is The Ultimate Gift, and it really is a gift of a film.  You'll be nicely surprised you can watch this film with the whole family as there is,  from what I can remember virtually no profanity in the entire film, and its modest too, so you won't have to worry about any ""bedroom"" scenes either.  Just a nice, film, that you'll want to watch again the next day.

The end moral of the story seemed to be that if you have enough money you can do some good in the world (yet, it never addressed the fact that the money was made by exploiting the earth for oil and raising cattle, among other things).

Overseeing the mission is the executor of Red's estate [played marvelously by Bill Cobbs] & his helpful assistant [Lee Meriwether].

Jason's quest is fraught with hard work, obstacles, even danger - and along the way he meets some interesting characters, such as the hard-working cattle rancher Gus [Brian Dennehy], the charming & witty Emily[ Abigail Breslin], and the lovely Alexia [Ali Hillis]. The storyline is simple enough, but is told well, and we the viewers get to learn along with Jason as he learns the 12 gifts - of work, money, problems, friends, giving, family, gratitude, learning, laughter, the gift of a day, dreams, and of course, love.

1580144,4,B00005JPNV,"Jim 'You Don't Have to be Blind to See' Stovall  is an inspirational writer who in 2001 published a little book by the name of THE ULTIMATE GIFT in which he transposed many of his motivational teachings into a novel form, a story of how a tape of a dying man can alter the life of a crassly money-centric young grandson leading him through trials and challenges to teach him the meaning of life.  Now THE ULTIMATE GIFT comes to the screen/DVD and before making the groaning judgment that here is yet another insipid little tale about learning life's lessons and gaining some spirituality in the process, try watching this two hour traversal of well acted and well scripted (Cheryl McKay) and well directed (Michael O. Sajbel) input.  There is a lot more to the film than the grinches might think!

A wealthy man Red Stevens (James Garner) has amassed a fortune, turning his personal life into a shambles in the process and producing a family of greedy ruthless gluttons - with one exception: one son rebelled and lost his life to dreams despite the aspirations of the father. Red has just died and the will is read by Red's longtime partner and lawyer Ted (Bill Cobbs) and his devoted assistant Miss Hastings (Lee Meriwether): the family is outraged at the results of Red's division of his fortune and the one person who is left to learn of the will's content is Red's egocentric grandson Jason (Drew Fuller).  Through a taped interview just prior to his death Red outlines the twelve lessons Jason must learn if he is to inherit anything. And here begins the episodic journey during which Jason learns about poverty, compassion, friends, death, and spirituality that changes Jason into a full human being and creates a character who gives back more than he gets.

Along the way Jason encounters work-ethic Gus (Brian Dennehy), a little girl Emily dying from leukemia (Abigail Breslin)  whose sharp wit and tongue manifest wisdom that leads to the bonding of Jason and Emily's mother  Alexia (Ali Hillis), and  host of other character actors in the various parts of the world where Jason's journey takes him. Yes, the plot is predictable, and yes, the tenor of the piece borders on soap opera at times, but the end result is an examination of life that is told with enough fine humor and realistic dialog that it works.  If viewers pass by this DVD because they fear it is just another sappy lecture, they will miss the pleasure of entering the realm of tender communication delivered with style and sincerity.

1580146,4,B00005JPNV,"The Ultimate Gift' is a fun and surprising inspirational gem.  Not knowing quite what to expect, the movie quickly develops an emotional and entertaining core.  Often funny, sad, mysterious, and uplifting in different measures, the film pulls out a unique bag of tricks.  Sort of like the `Willy Wonka' of spiritual cinema, `The Ultimate Gift' is more than a ""Hallmark"" Christian experience.

It all begins after the death of oil tycoon, Red Stevens (James Garner) who has left videotapes for his family.  Gathered around the conference table in his lucrative company headquarters, all members wait on pins and needles to see what they will inherit from him.  Crassly, the greedy family can't help but commiserate over the lack of possessions he's bequeathed to them.  As his custom, Jason (Drew Fuller), his black sheep grandson, comes late to the proceedings, fully expecting nothing, but wanting to make sure nonetheless.  What he gets is a treasure hunt.  If he performs a series of feats for the edification of his board of trustees, he will win ""the ultimate gift"".  Heading that board is fellow associate Mr. Hamilton (Bill Cobbs), who anchors the whole deal as a living negotiator.  If Jason flubs on any one of the ""assignments,"" he loses the gift.

A lot of the proceedings depend a great deal on Red predicting what Jason will do next during the videotape.  It works admirably and there's enough good humor to smooth out the edges of our disbelief.  Events are often unpredictable, and the acting ranges from genuine to genuinely good.  Particularly noteworthy is Abigail Breslan (Oscar nominated child prodigy from 'Little Miss Sunshine') who gives another fine performance as Emily, a sick girl with a sharp tongue, but a good heart.  Reflecting on God and heaven, she sagely says, ""He paints every color of a butterfly with His fingers.""

The movie also brings the welcome return of Brian Dennehy as Gus, his relative from Texas.  Some of the funniest parts are taken from his Southern mansion.  One scene where he is rudely awakened by an electric cattle prod left me in stitches.  Sometimes the relatives become caricatures, but that's few and far between.  At one holiday dinner, an argument ensues and one woman tartly states ""Money's just as green from Manhattan.""  The pace is wonderfully edited with the last portion slightly too languorous in places--even if the film needs to stop and reflect awhile.  With these minor objections out of the way, the movie is wonderfully nourishing for the heart and soul.

Some controversy remains for the spiritual nature of the film.  Glancing over some reviews, I found some critics becoming defensive for any favorable take on the movie.  Christianity is sprinkled throughout.  During work ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" plays from Dylan's Christian era, and a romantic dinner scene ""Lord of the Dance"" is cleverly piped in with acoustical guitars at a fancy restaurant.  At the hospital, Emily frequents the chapel where Jason tells her the Sacred Heart statue shows Jesus' open arms to embrace her.  Critics apologetically (or defensively) say that Jesus is only mentioned once in the whole movie.  I don't personally think anyone should have to defend a movie for being overtly Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or whatever.  ""Pain is your teacher,"" says Red to Jason on the videotape before going to the great beyond.  This could be said in an Asian movie.  'The Ultimate Gift' is overtly Christian, but inclusive.  Another objection may come with the points of wisdom provided at the end.  While I enjoyed the elaboration, some may find the lesson condescending--an unnecessary Sunday school highlighter pen review.

With all my lowered expectations, 'The Ultimate Gift' is a surprise.  The comedic timing is great, the mystery is fun, and the emotional trek is worthwhile. (Based on a novel by Jim Stovall.)",1187827200,122,3866,5.050552922590837

1580150,4,B00005JPNV,"Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller) is a trust fund baby--he's eaten from a silver spoon his entire life. At his grandfather Red's funeral he makes a showy (and late) entrance, perhaps punctuating his low opinion of the man. But from his grave Red (James Garner) has words for his money hungry relatives at the reading of his will. No one gets what they expect, including Jason.

In a closed conference room with only his grandfather's trusted attorney (Bill Cobbs) and secretary (Lee Meriwether) in attendance, Jason is advised by Red via a video recording that he's being given a series of gifts. The catch? He isn't told what the gifts are, only that he's to arrive at the airport and await further instructions. Is this his grandfather's form of a joke, or is Red Stevens trying to reach out and teach him things he never learned from his materialistic family?

Based on a novella by noted motivational speaker and author Jim Stovall, the filmmakers endeavored to preserve the heart of his story while still producing a relevant movie. Says screenwriter Cheryl McKay in an interview conducted by Rene Gutteridge who wrote the novelization of the screenplay, ""The biggest challenge was figuring out how to handle all the gifts and not come off with a movie that felt episodic. We had to blend a couple of them together and de-emphasize a couple of them because twelve is a lot to cover in a two-hour movie.""

Winner of the Heartland Film Festival's Crystal Heart Award, The Ultimate Gift features an Oscar worthy cast. Drew Fuller (best known for his recurring role as Chris Halliwell in Charmed) pulls off Jason's cockiness and spoiled brat ways, but also believably portrays his transformed self. His facial expressions alone made me laugh out loud a few times. Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Signs) could easily have over played her character Emily, but she doesn't, and she wins our hearts in the process. Ali Hillis (Must Love Dogs) is another notable cast member as Jason's love interest and Emily's mother. No one hits it out of the ball park, but you can still win a game without home runs, and The Ultimate Gift is a winner.

The Ultimate Gift is a predictable film you somehow want to be predictable. Its PG rating allows for a few mild swear words and tense thematic moments, but this is really a movie the whole family can enjoy.

From the vast acres of a Texas ranch to the wilds of a South American jungle, Jason's assumptions about his grandfather, and himself, will never be the same. And even though you'll most likely guess the film's ending, it's the journey that matters. We're taken on an exciting one with Jason as he discovers not only the ultimate gift, but what type of a man he's truly capable of being.

1580231,5,B00005JPNV,"I'm not up on the latest movies, so when a screener of a film called The Ultimate Gift arrived in my post office box on Tuesday morning, I didn't give it much thought.  I hadn't heard of the movie when it was released in theaters, but was reviewing the screener for potential review at the request of a colleague.  The fact that one of my favorite young actresses, Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine fame, was involved did pique my curiosity.

Imagine my shock two hours later when I came to the stunning conclusion that this film now ranks in my top five favorite movies of all time.  The Ultimate Gift is based on an inspirational novel by author Jim Stovall and tells the story of one young man's life transformation from a spoiled rotten trust fund leech into a loving philanthropist.  The main character, Jason Stevens, must navigate a series of twelve tasks/gifts given to him posthumously by his paternal grandfather in order to earn a mystery inheritance.  The ""gifts"" are designed to teach him a series of life lessons and become progressively more challenging and life wrenching.  Jason comes from the most despicable breed of wealthy snobs you've ever seen and is nursing a lifelong grudge against his grandfather.  He launches into the challenge with one sole goal in mind:  getting the money.  It's his assumption that more money will equate to happiness.  Happiness appears to be one of the only commodities that's sorely missing in his life.

I won't give away the ending of this remarkable film, but I do challenge you to get to the conclusion without feeling your own heart grow three sizes and reaching for the tissue.  The Ultimate Gift is a movie to be shared and discussed with family members of all ages for the wonderful life lessons it shares.  Entertaining performances by a talented cast lend to the charm, but the true value of this film is in the ""gift"" it gives to the watcher.

It is THAT KIND of movie.",1185408000,,837,4.261146496815287
1580239,5,B00005JPNV,"This movie was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It did not get the publicity that it deserved unfortunately. It was filmed here in Charlotte, North Carolina (where I live) and it wasn't even advertised heavily here in our theatres, and didn't stay long at any of them.  I just don't understand the reasoning. Everyone should see this movie, and reflect on what life has given them.  We all have to work for what we want; We can't expect life to hand us everything on a silver platter.  James Garner's spotlight role is ingeniously done.  Drew Fuller is excellent. Abigail Breslin should get an oscar..what a little actress!",1185235200,8,636,4.651785714285714

1580351,5,B00005JPNV,"I saw this movie on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was inspirational, romantic, heart-wrenching, adventurous and humorous.  I liked it so much that I bought the original book by Jim Stovall.  The book tells the story from the perspective of the lawyer who is the executor of the rich uncle's estate.  The movie tells the story from more than one perspective which allows the viewer to relate to each of the characters as they grow and interact.  I will pre-buy this movie to show my kids and friends!",1184630400,4,507,4.588888888888889

1580353,5,B00005JPNV,"I saw the book in a bookstore and after reading the subject, went to see it at the theatre.  I took my husband back that night to see it too, and then took both of my college aged sons to see it that week.  Even they admitted it was really good.
It's one of the best movies I have ever seen......of course the acting is superb, but the story is so true and applicable for everyone's life.  No one ever wishes on their death bed that they'd made more money, but rather they wish for other things that they didn't do. Basically the story is about what's of true value in life, and we all could use a lesson in that.
I plan on buying it the day it becomes available, and several copies for friends.",1184284800,4,695,4.095588235294118
1580354,5,B00005JPNV,"The Ultimate Gift is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw the movie in the theatre and it changed my way of thinking.  This is an EXCELLENT movie for the entire family to see.  I plan to host viewing parties, so I can show the movie and discuss it afterwards.  There are several Christian worldview values throughout the movie.  I would encourage people to host viewing parties, so others can see the movie and see the beauty of this masterpiece.

1580357,5,B00005JPNV,"The Ultimate Gift is exactly that.  The movie is based on the wonderfully written novel of the same name that has survived the metamorphous of a film transition.  I am no stranger to this treasure and have written a review of this book on Amazon.  I strongly suggest both the film and the book in the order that's best for you.  For those who don't read many books, you'll find this one well worth the wait.  Like the book, I am very much waiting for the DVD release so that I may share its rich gifts with the ones I love.  Like ""A Christmas Carol"" The Ultimate Gift is about redemption; the transformation from selfishness to selflessness.  It is this reviewer's belief that generosity is the root of all happiness.  And joy is the effervescence of the true Christian.",1177804800,16,770,4.489208633093525

The way it's supposed to be.  These types of movies should be supported by consumers to send a clear message to Hollywood that movies can be tasteful and have a good moral value and character.  The only thing that disappoints me is the fact that there wasn't more advertising done to get the word out.  I only knew about it because of Amazon sending me a notice based on my previous on-line interests which I really appreciated.",1174953600,18,579,4.627450980392157
1580359,4,B00005JPNV,"This movie, while predictable in its drama, nonetheless does what long-term winners at the box office so often do--make the moviegoer feel good.  What's wrong with that?  It's A Wonderful Life type entertainment that is a treat for the whole family.

The cast is first class with James Garner (Grand Prix), Lee Meriweather (Former Miss America), Drew Fuller (the heart throb of Charmed) and Abby Breslin (Oscar nominee, Litte Miss Sunshine)amongst other special actors including the formidable performance by Bill Cobbs as the astute Mr. Hamilton.  Hey, the movie has the actors!

At the same time, one comes away feeling a special draw toward the movie's theme, which is ""be somebody, give yourself away"".  Truly the punch in this film is the down right honest delivery of the values that one should hold dear.

Give yourself a gift and go see THE ULTIMATE GIFT--and take a group with you.",1174089600,12,890,4.932885906040268
1580360,4,B00005JPNV,"Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller) is a trust fund baby--he's eaten from a silver spoon his entire life. At his grandfather Red's funeral he makes a showy (and late) entrance, perhaps punctuating his low opinion of the man. But from his grave Red (James Garner) has words for his money hungry relatives at the reading of his will. No one gets what they expect, including Jason.

In a closed conference room with only his grandfather's trusted attorney (Bill Cobbs) and secretary (Lee Meriwether) in attendance, Jason is advised by Red via a video recording that he's being given a series of gifts. The catch? He isn't told what the gifts are, only that he's to arrive at the airport and await further instructions. Is this his grandfather's form of a joke, or is Red Stevens trying to reach out and teach him things he never learned from his materialistic family?

Based on a novella by noted motivational speaker and author Jim Stovall, the filmmakers endeavored to preserve the heart of his story while still producing a relevant movie. Says screenwriter Cheryl McKay in an interview conducted by Rene Gutteridge who wrote the novelization of the screenplay, ""The biggest challenge was figuring out how to handle all the gifts and not come off with a movie that felt episodic. We had to blend a couple of them together and de-emphasize a couple of them because twelve is a lot to cover in a two-hour movie.""

Winner of the Heartland Film Festival's Crystal Heart Award, The Ultimate Gift features an Oscar worthy cast. Drew Fuller (best known for his recurring role as Chris Halliwell in Charmed) pulls off Jason's cockiness and spoiled brat ways, but also believably portrays his transformed self. His facial expressions alone made me laugh out loud a few times. Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Signs) could easily have over played her character Emily, but she doesn't, and she wins our hearts in the process. Ali Hillis (Must Love Dogs) is another notable cast member as Jason's love interest and Emily's mother. No one hits it out of the ball park, but you can still win a game without home runs, and The Ultimate Gift is a winner.

The Ultimate Gift is a predictable film you somehow want to be predictable. Its PG rating allows for a few mild swear words and tense thematic moments, but this is really a movie the whole family can enjoy.

From the vast acres of a Texas ranch to the wilds of a South American jungle, Jason's assumptions about his grandfather, and himself, will never be the same. And even though you'll most likely guess the film's ending, it's the journey that matters. We're taken on an exciting one with Jason as he discovers not only the ultimate gift, but what type of a man he's truly capable of being.
