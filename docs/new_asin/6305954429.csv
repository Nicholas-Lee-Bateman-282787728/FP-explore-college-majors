1102800,3,6305954429,"Really, three and a half stars--there is every reason to truly appreciate this movie apart from superb acting. Yet, I didn't. Stark, uncompromising, well-written, intensely personal, you learn a great deal about Rosetta very quickly--the care-taker, the sufferer, the poucher, the selfish hypocrite, and the person desperately seeking to be normal by having a job (from an invariably male employer), a friend and freedom from her disturbed mother. She and her male friend have  shared roles and desires which we are to divine are also those of her mother, an obvious victim of male oppression. Drenched in self-defeat and despair, and after much labor, the viewer arrives to see the whole pattern repeat itself again, blindly repeating its false and uncharitable theme: every woman needs her man.",995673600,2,796,5.267716535433071
1102801,4,6305954429,"Relentlessly downbeat.  Heck, the sun doesn't even shine in Rosetta's world of despair.  And the production values made me wonder if the Dardenne brothers signed the Dogme 95 pact.  I now understand the controversy at the 2000 Cannes film festival when this dour film picked up the Palme D'Or.  However, despite it all, I was moved by Rosetta's plight, and I rooted for her.  No doubt this is due to Emilie Dequenne's amazing performance in the title role.",992390400,4,456,4.794871794871795

1102803,1,6305954429,"I chose to see this film because it is in the list of Cannes winners. While most of the movies on that list are really great, ""Rosetta"" was a big disappointment for me. I consider myself sophisticated enough to enjoy not just the pure entertainment-like moies, but the art movies as well, but ""Rosetta"" is neither of those, in my opinion. I could guess what artistic message is sent to the audience with the use of the shaky camera (maybe the director didn't have enough money to pay for a professional cameraman?), but whatever it is, watching ""Rosetta"" is a very unpleasant experience. The absense of any plot, and the annoingly repetitive scenes make it even worse. I think ""Rosetta"" is one of these movies that pretend to have some artistic quality where there is none. ""Rosetta"" is certainly not one of the mainstream movies, but this fact alone doesn't make it a good movie.",986256000,4,880,4.683870967741935
1102804,5,6305954429,"Rosetta,a film that deals with the struggles of a young woman who has just been fired from her job at a factory in Belgium,was an extremely pleasant surprise for me. Emilie Dequenne's performance in the lead role is riveting,realistic,raw,and energetic. If this were a film financed by hollywood,there's no doubt her gender would have been exploited,and she would have been some sexpot with boy troubles. Not so in this cinematic effort. The focus is almost entirely on her effort to secure employment just so she can get a meal and help her alcoholic mother with the rent. She doesn't have time to chase boys,she's only concerned with surviving. The most startling aspect of this film is it's avoidance of manufactured sentimentlity,complete with cheasy music,to get the viewer to sympathize with her predicament. There's no epiphanies,startling revelations,or some cheap trick ending tacked on for marketing purposes. The way the film is shot(16mm or digital video(i'm not sure),handheld tracking shots,what seems like natural lighting)gives it a powerful,frenetic feel. Some people are turned off by the camera movement,but to do it any other way would negate the spontaneous,out of control atmosphere(maybe it doesn't bother me because i spent almost 2 years out at sea without getting sick).The camera follows her every move,you'll feel like a peeping tom stalking this young lady. The supporting cast are all solid,but it's really Dequenne's  show,it's the main reason to seek out this hidden gem. Highly recommended,especially for the art house crowd. My only complaint,and it's not with the film itself,is that,why can't more director's take chances with movies such as Rebecca. It's an example of what can be accomplished when you don't try to please the masses,and truly ""reflect"" grim realities(something hollywood portends to do).Croupier,Dark Days,Human Resources,Blair Witch,The Last Broadcast,and now Rebecca,it's been an amazing 2 years for independent film. I consider this another one of my all time favorites.",971740800,10,2028,5.479233226837061
1102805,3,6305954429,"This movie is not entertainment--it's meant to provoke thinking.
No music, shaky camera work that'll scar off 98% of American viewers, no special effects--it's definitely not appealing.

1102926,5,6305954429,"""Rosetta"" from 1999 was directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, and is a film that will be remembered and talked about for years to come. While it's easy to make the mistake of superficially comparing it to Robert Bresson's ""Mouchette"" 1967, this film has none of that film's ascetic and abstract qualities. Thankfully, the Dardenne brothers have gone for a semi-documentary style (cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;), to recreate real-life situations with vivid poignancy. So there is no likeness to the aforementioned film; ""Rosetta"" is actually superior, as far as I'm concerned! The Dardenne brothers have given us a stark depiction of a young-woman (she's about 17), who has the arduous task of taking on the responsibilities of an adult (looking for a full-time job, and caring for her mother and herself), and being robbed of having the life of a normal girl her age. She is also quite depressed abour her situation (who wouldn't be), and what she now sees as a 'dog-eat-dog' existence! Emilie Dequenne as 'Rosetta' is a revelation. She has the rare gift of being natural in front of the camera, and expresses more with her face, than an actor with years of experience, her performance was simply incredible! I don't understand the idiotic comments some reviewers here have made about the camera work. The Dardenne bros. were obviously intelligent enough to know, that 'Rosetta's' claustrophobic (she lives in a trailer) and frenetic existence, demanded tight close-ups/hand-held camera POV, to better place us in her world and in having empathy with her plight. These people should take an extensive Film-class first and foremost! I guess most people just lack artistic sensibilities anyway. More importantly, the message the Dardenne bros. have given us here, is clearly obvious to me. How is it possible for a girl like 'Rosetta' to experience such poverty in a highly advanced and industrialized nation like Belgium, and in 1999 no less? Now imagine, if this kind of poverty is only suppose to exist in the Third World (and we know these conditions have existed everywhere at all times, including right here in the U.S.), what does it say about the kind of world we live in today in 2012, when things are even worse-off! Who runs this global slave-shop? Think about it, long and carefully. Thank God for filmmakers like the Dardennes! An excellent film, this is truly a modern film-masterpiece. Deeply moving, and intended for an audience of thoughtful and compassionate human-beings. The DVD picture and sound quality by Criterion is first-rate of course. NTSC, French (English subtitles), extras, NR 98 mins. (BTW: The supplemental interviews with Emilie Dequenne, Olivier Gourmet, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardennes were very insightful.)

1102927,5,6305954429,"Rosseta is a disturbing picture. Filmed according the precepts of the cinema verite so in vogue in the sixties, the film accuses a direct influence of Mouchette, a classic film of Robert Bresson.

Rosseta is a girl unable to hold in a job steadily, her mother is alcoholic and good for nothing, so Rosseta has to tabe the ride and let behind the used customes of a girl of her age, as a amatter of fact, she cannot establish a rapport with the outer world, she ignores how to dance and the emotional state is very unstable.

The nervous camera doesn't leave her alone for a single shot. It runs behind her and nothing else, the dialogues are straight and awful. Her cry of battle is to survive in the hostile world she has to live.

A winner film which deserved Cannes in 1999 and for Emile the prize of Best Actress. A genuine masterpiece but if you are not related with Bresson's filmography, you pitifully won't capture the essence of the film.",1346112000,,947,4.46242774566474
1102928,5,6305954429,"Primal,spirited endeavour by the Dardennes brothers. Rosetta,even the name,like an original language of film. The young heroine is a driven,cursed soul,rushing everywhere,trying to break into the Fort Kox of normality,so she can live and breathe and see. For most of the film she is blind,going about her busy day,surviving with an alcoholic,promiscuous mother. She beavers about the trailer park where she lives and by a river bank,using an old bottle to fish. She cannot hold a job down and is sacked from one and the employer has to literally fight her off the premises. She is angry,unsmiling and tearful,whispering mantras to herself as she goes to sleep,to reinforce her little gains. A man's interest is of little comfort to her, although his attempts to make her dance bring the only smiles. The young girl playing the part is an unprofessional actor. Her every body movement is tracked by a hand-held camera,literally zipping all over the place. This girl has no disguises,she is truthful,a wiry young soul,burning like a fuse. She has more grit than a bucketful of oysters. She moves the film along at such a pace,au naturelle,in such spartan settings you wonder if this is documentary or real.",1274745600,,1204,5.055276381909548
1102929,4,6305954429,"This film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and was heralded upon release. Seeing it recently, I think it's nothing remarkable on it's own. When viewed from the perspective of the forward moving artistic careers of the Dardenne brothers, Rosetta is then very significant. The style of this work is very neo-realist from the perspective of content and aesthetically speaking, this film is very much Dogma 95. The Dardenne brothers actually stick to their guns more often than Mr. Lars von Trier, who moved away from Dogma 95 aesthetically very fast. The storylines that the Dardennes deal with are very well geared to this sort of presentation. Visceral, shaky handheld camerawork, in your face first-person perspective, natural lighting and probably a good deal of improvisation on set.

Rosetta is the not so pleasant protagonist of this film. Her current motivation in life is finding and keeping a job and that's the basic premise of the film. It's life shown from the view of those near the bottom of society, at least in civilized Europe. The main character is purposefully made frustrating and at times repellant so she doesn't become a suffering saint-like figure in our eyes. Rosetta is shown to be just as predatory as the rest of us, only in the moving conclusion do we grasp a deeper sense of her humanity which she has been steadily keeping under wraps. This is an intelligent acting job by Emile Dequenne and she won Best Actress at Cannes for this role.

Some have embraced the Dardennes as directors to watch and some have even claimed an affinity with the great French director Robert Bresson. I don't see that at all. Bresson's films are about quietude and an introspective sense of the spiritual. The films I've seen by the Dardennes point in a different way, noisy, abrasive, full of activity and a coiled anger at the injustices of life. It's a completely different approach than Bresson. Rosetta is a neo-realist film done in full Dogma 95 fashion. It is certainly worth seeing and I'll keep exploring new films from this directing duo as they are released.",1188691200,,2073,4.853107344632768

Rosetta has an iron clad determination that drives her, and she will not give up no matter what.

An extremely real, gritty, emotional and touching film that won numerous awards for the actress playing rosetta(?milie Dequenne) as well as for Jean-Pierre Dardenne & Luc Dardenne at the cannes film festival.

An absolute treasure.",1147219200,11,776,4.649635036496351
1102931,5,6305954429,"Rosetta is a powerful film depicting a young woman, Rosetta (milie Dequenne), living in the cracks of the Belgian society.  The crack in which Rosetta has fallen is a part of society where she has no social protection from the government where corporations exploit her without giving her any securities.  Rosetta is considered a minor as she is in the years between adolescence and adulthood.

The initial scene is set in motion as Rosetta violently fights her way into the office at the company where she works.  When she arrives to her desired destination it becomes evident that she has been fired. However, what would make someone young that upset for being fired?  This is a question that is answered as Rosetta returns home to the trailer park in which she lives.  Rosetta is a proud person who struggles with keeping it together for her and her alcoholic mother.  The mother evidently has been neglecting her daughter for most of her upbringing as Rosetta takes care of herself in every aspect of life as she has done it for a very long time.

The young female protagonist of story lives a life where she strives for socioeconomic security through a job.  This is easier said than done as she finds it very hard to keep a job as she lacks experience and laws that protect her from being exploited by small companies.  Rosetta also seeks a home, a place where she can find emotional security, as she continues to hold on to her alcoholic and neglecting mother.

The struggle of Rosetta is not told through long scripted dialogues, but through the daily actions of Rosetta.  These actions are captured through a handheld camera as it flows with Rosetta and her difficult journey, which enhance the realism of the film.  The realism is soul tearing as the audience cannot escape the world of Rosetta, a world in which Rosetta attempts to find a spot.

Rosetta offers an intricate character study of the young woman through her struggles.  milie Dequenne was awarded the prize for best actress at the Cannes Film Festival for her part.  Besides the character study the film also offers a well-made socioeconomic drama that had an impact on the Belgian government.  Shortly after Rosetta was released the Belgian government passed a law branded as ""Plan Rosetta"". The law protects minors from being exploited by being paid less than minimum wage.",1098835200,3,2348,4.800995024875622
1102932,5,6305954429,"I remember, at least half a dozen times, passing this movie by in the video store, gravitating towards it due to the legend ""Winner Palm D'Or Best Actress/Best Picture"" and the lovely face of Emilie Dequenne, then passing it by after reading the back.  The summary of the plot bored me so immediately and intensely that I could not imagine actually sitting and watching the film.  I eventually changed my mind, and thankfully so.
Rosetta is an absolutely driven character, almost an animal, single-minded in her goals.  Those goals are mundane: find a job, lead a normal life.  Her obstacles are mundane: rent, alcoholic mother, cramps.  She asks questions, gets her answers, and walks away with no pretense of social grace.  For most scenes the camera either points in the direction of Rosetta's POV, over her shoulder, or aims directly into her face.  The shot rarely sits still: action and object are the same here.  We see what she sees as she sees it and make judgments about people and situations alongside her, a process that usually reveals how silly normal people seem when viewed by someone with no tolerance for nonsense.  She does not understand dancing - leisure, or why people would indulge in it when other things need doing, is foreign to her.
Routine fills her existence, and when the routines of friendship and work cannot be found, she constructs new and even unnecessarily complicated routines: cross the road to find the sewer where she hid her boots, change out of shoes into boots to cross the mud to reach the lake where she's set up fish traps with bobbypins and broken bottles, every day.  She doesn't even keep the fish.  In that way she, like most of us, is completely neurotic - but who has the motivation to carry out their designs with so much determination, in ignorance of those neuroses?  Who completely ignores defeat?
I would recommend other Dequenne pictures, but apparently her only other role is alongside Mark Dacascos in the inscrutible Brotherhood of the Wolf.  Stick with Rosetta and enjoy.",1041120000,16,2033,4.841040462427745

This low-budget, avant-garde film uses only the bare minimum of means with all extraneous elements eliminated.  It's an honest, real portrait of a struggling Belgian teenager as she is determined to live a normal life.  The film is shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras, many scenes close-up, and like most films of this genre, it is slow to start and some viewers may find this disconcerting.  In the end they maybe left asking questions, but isn't that what it's all about?

1102935,5,6305954429,"This is one of those films that restored my confidence in filmaking as an artform.  It is anti-Hollywood in the extreme, and is realism in its most raw form; in your face, without apology.
To speak of a ""plot"" here would be inaccurate.  Rosetta closely follows the life of a young girl who lives in dire poverty, as she struggles to find employment.  Some reviewers have said she seeks a ""normal life.""  But what is key here, is that in modern capitalist societies, a person's self-worth is determined by their projects, i.e. their occupation.  Without a job, and without a real home, Rosetta faces an identity crisis.  Every time she is fired from a job, her self-esteem is destroyed.  Unlike her alcoholic mother, who has simply given up, Rosetta resolves to fight.
Like a ship trapped in an ice-pack, Rosetta is distant, cold, and detached.  Because she cannot love herself, she will not permit others to love her, or even to befriend her.  She has made a decision to obtain a job, restore her self-image, and THEN re-enter the world of the living.  Her only possession of value are her shoes, which she carefully keeps clean, as she is forced to trod through a muddy forest to her mother's squalid trailer.  Every detail of the film plays a crucial role; since we cannot know Rosetta intimately through her personality, we must learn to understand her through every little action she takes.
In a economic system which separates people both materially and emotionally, living a fulfilling existence is painfully difficult.  It is only at the edges where we see the true drama unfold, and this is where ""Rosetta"" takes place.  The final sequence is brilliant, as Rosetta is literally ""forced"" to make an ultimate decision.",1022544000,3,1724,4.8231292517006805

She is trying to break free of this lifestyle, mainly by having a job.  Apparently it is very difficult to do so in her time - she tries various places but no one is hiring - and it is very easy to be let go for minor infractions - such as being late to work because the bus was late.

7898817,5,6305954429,"Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne wrote and directed 'Rosetta', winner of the Palm d'Or at Cannes in 1999, a film about an adolescent girl who shares a trailer and her existence with an alcoholic mother. Its simple story is put together with an intimate, naturalistic style: Rosetta carries the burden of what little is left of her dysfunctional family and aspires to get a job, her own place, to live a normal life, to find freedom; one day, she meets a young man who is willing to help her... The film packs a powerful punch, thanks in great part to the excellent performance of &Eacute;milie Dequenne, who won the prize for Best Actress at Cannes that year. Her facial expressions, her posture, even the way she scurries around from place to place, like a raccoon or some other wild animal, all convey the pain, despair, anger and shame that are eating her. I hesitated to watch it at fist, because I didn't know if I was in the mood for something terribly heavy. If you share the same dilemma, fear not: 'Rosetta' isn't nearly as harrowing as, say, Lars Von Trier's 'Breaking The Waves' (1996). It's emotionally demanding, but the economy of its narrative provides a certain lightness. There's a moment in which the main character falls into muddy waters and has a hard time getting out, and I worried for a second that the film might start going into some not-very-subtle symbolism, which I think would have detracted from its main strength - that is, its minimalism and focus on the girl's primitive state of mind, desires, rough gestures. But I don't really think it goes in that direction. Another nice thing about 'Rosetta' is that it clocks out at 95 minutes. It would be too much if it went on for 3 hours. The length is just right.

If you've already watched and enjoyed this film, I recommend 'The Maid' (2009), by Chilean director Sebasti&aacute;n Silva, which is similar in tone and is also very good, one of my favorites.",1384128000,2,1949,4.682215743440233

With films that are highly anticipated for their quality writing and direction, back in 1999, the Dardenne Brothers achieved enormous success with their film ""Rosetta"" which won the ""Palme D'Or"", ""Prize of the Ecumenical Jury - Special Mention"" and ""Best Actress"" for milie Dequenne at the Cannes Film Festival.

And back in Belgium, the film was also inspirational in creating a new law that would prohibit employees from paying teenage employees less than minimum wage.

VIDEO:

""Rosetta - The Criterion Collection #621 is a film presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1 aspect ratio). The film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!  For a '90s film, a lot of films made during this decade tend to show a bit of softness and lack of detail.  For ""Rosetta"", the transfer was well-done.

You can see the mud and grime on Rosetta quite clearly, while the handheld camera may be too shaky for some viewers, I wasn't bothered by the style of filmmaking or camerawork.  In fact, I applauded this style because it was independent filmmaking at its best.  No overacting, nothing too elaborate, it felt real, it seemed real and cinematographer Alain Marcoen did a wonderful job on how he kept focused on Rosetta.

According to the Criterion Collection, the transfer was supervised by director of photography Alain Marcoen.  The new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35 mm blowup interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PF Clean.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Rosetta - The Criterion Collection #621 is presented in lossless 2.0 surround.  Dialogue is clear, as with the sound of Riquet's moped engine being revved up, these sounds are clear.  English subtitles were easy to read!

According to the Criterion Collection, the original 2.0 surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35mm magnetic tracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Rosetta - The Criterion Collection #621"" comes with the following special features:

  Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne - (1:01:52) Conversation between film critic Scott Foundas and filmmakers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne .
  milie Dequenne and Olivier Gourmet - (18:17) 2012 interviews with milie Dequenne (who plays Rosetta) and Olivier Gourmet (who plays the boss).
  Trailer - (1:04) The original theatrical trailer for ""Rosetta"".

EXTRAS:

""Rosetta - The Criterion Collection #621"" comes with a 16-page booklet with the following essay ""Radical Economy"" by Kent Jones.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A heartbreaking and realistic portrayal of a young woman in despair and a true representation of many who are starving and doing all they can to survive in today's world.

Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne managed to create a film that resonates strongly, even moreso today because of its portrayal of a young woman's life of just wanting to work and survive.  The desperation that sets in, in the minds of many people knowing that are close to losing everything around them and are powerless.

Rosetta is can only get temporary jobs and when she does look for a job, they are only looking for people who are long-term unemployed.

And how far will someone go to get a job?  Would you kill someone?  Would you wish for one to get injured?  If you were in desperation mode, how far would you go?  Would you kill yourself?

And part of the efficacy of ""Rosetta"" is the fact that the Dardenne brothers didn't want the film to seem like a film.  The casting of new actress milie Dequenne is part of what makes ""Rosetta"" seem authentic.  At the time, she was not an experienced actress.  She just tried out for a role, not knowing if she would get it.  And for an unknown, she gave the performance of her life.  Playing a young woman who lives a poor life, living with a mother who constantly drinks and having sex with men and literally out of control.

She wants to be the person in charge, but at her young age, everything constantly works against her.  She doesn't have money to pay the bills, she doesn't have money to eat much and thus she tries to collect trout through a hidden trap in muddy waters.  Her life is primarily spent on looking for a job and when she gets one, she is let go because the jobs are temporary and she tries to stay at the job at all costs, even though she must be forcibly removed.

The film was made in 1999, but how many people around the world can sympathize with Rosetta?  During this day and age with weak world economies, Rosetta is a young woman that is representative of many young adults.  And while many young adults are seen moving back home, Rosetta lives at home but her mother is just mentally out of it.  She is always drunk and for the most part, she is out of it.

We see Rosetta experiencing the job of finding a job, the heartbreaking emotions of losing a job and also having a mother that is not there.  No one is there for her, except a young man named Riquet.  A guy that is so nice to her that he gives her free waffles, let's her stay at his place, feeds her, even goes as far as wanting to pay her money doing some unofficial work for him, so he can help her out.

But for Rosetta, her validation is not friendship, it's about holding a full-time job.  A job that proves to her that she can survive in society and then possibly get the medical treatment that her mother needs.

And of course, there is more to this film than what I have mentioned so far.  From character interaction and seeing how Rosetta deals with her problem and the things that go through her mind, it's a realistic portrayal about a desperate young woman.  We learn why she has this mindset leading to her actions, can we sympathize with her?  Should we be critical of her?

It's important to note that ""Rosetta"" also marks an earlier Dogme filmmaking style of the Dardenne brothers.  From camera positions, to the use of handheld camera filmmaking, it's a style that helped this independent film give a voyeuristic approach of being around the character and exposing of her problems in life.  The camera never leaves Rosetta, it's with her when she is looking for a job, it's focused on her when she is dealing with customers, it's with her when she is having stomach pains.  The camera is fixed on Rosetta most of the time.

And it's a style that was quite effective.  Many cinema fans were astounded by this realistic style and storyline that not only established the careers for both Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne but also actress milie Dequenne.  But also earned them an award at the Cannes Film Festival.

As for the Blu-ray release,  the 1999 film looked great on Blu-ray.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track is dialogue-driven and is crystal clear.  And special features also showcase 2012 interviews with the Dardenne brothers, milie Dequenne and Fabrizio Rongione.

Overall, ""Rosetta"" is a fantastic earlier award-winning film for both Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne.  Sometimes slice of life films may not appeal to everyone and for those so used to the banality of Hollywood films and seeing the rags-to-riches storyline, I'll tell you right now, ""Rosetta"" is not that type of film.

It's a film that doesn't focus on answering questions of how life would end up for Rosetta.  It's a slice of life film showcasing a desperate woman who is up to her wit's end because of her inability of finding a job.  And how far she would go in order to get a job.  It's a film that relies on actress milie Dequenne being at her best by acting natural, not overacting but putting herself in the shoes of a woman who feels that life is too difficult.

I have no doubt that for many people today, seeing as how many people are affected by their country's economy, can sympathize with Rosetta, because many people are suffering like her or worse today compared to the late dot-com '90s where I found some people scratching their heads when watching this review and wondering why this film was such a big deal.

""Rosetta"" is a film that doesn't follow a Hollywood traditional style of filmmaking.  This is a character that is suffering and we, as the viewer, are constantly following Rosetta and wonder what moral choices she will make, in order to survive.  How far will she go?  It is reminiscent to Italian Neorealism featuring the challenges of the poor, but in this case, a documentary realism style approach, cinema avant-garde style shooting via handheld and showcasing a young woman who is alone, abandoned and devoid of hope.  Does hope even exist for young Rosetta?

Heartbreaking and real, Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne's award-winning film ""Rosetta"" is a compelling film featuring a wonderful performance by newcomer milie Dequenne.  Highly recommended!",1354320000,,9393,4.80536494073612
