This 2011 Gergiev/Kent/Brown/Mariinsky production of Strauss' Die Frau Ohne Schatten has gotten some bad reviews on Amazon, which I do not believe are justified. Yes, I admit that the production itself is highly imperfect... The opening scene (usually sure-fire musical excitement) falls flat; the voices (as mixed in the final soundtrack) are often drowned out by the orchestra; the bizarre pan-Asian cultural appropriation of the Magical realms, with geisha-white-face and the whiff of Colonial India married to Russian nesting dolls and Tibetan temples and Chinese-dragon-patterned Japanese kimonos, is just downright peculiar and out of sync with contemporary culture. And, yes, the all-Russian cast has problems with clear German diction. That said...

Valery Gergiev is an impassioned theatrical conductor of one of the world's greatest opera orchestras. Their musical performance is exciting, muscular, emotionally true. Perhaps a little crude in interpretation on occasion, but always entertaining, often magical, and utterly thrilling when it counts. Once you get past the boring beginning (briefly enlivened by the wonderful singing of Mlada Khudoley's Empress), the opera really picks up in the filthy Laundromat of Barak the Dyer (Edem Umerov) and his Wife (Olga Sergeeva), and cooks along from there all the way to the end. The three brothers are utterly forgettable, but Umerov and Sergeeva deliver great acting, singing, chemistry... even Olga Savova's rather lackluster Nurse comes vividly to life in this section. There was a warmth and humanity that I really appreciate.

This particular production caught on fire in the 2nd Act, thanks to the thrilling performance of Olga Sergeeva's Dyer's Wife. Wow! In her big scene, she really cooks! There are not many opera films which capture that kind of visceral excitement, so this particular performance would be worth owning just for that. But there's more.

The 3rd Act (which too often feels hammy and boring) zooms along in this production. The four principals do a bang-up job. Ignore the Nurse (who is vocally OK but otherwise ho hum). Mlada Khudoley as the Empress, especially, takes her big climactic scene and knocks it out of the park, very enjoyable. Barak and his Wife are also particularly wonderful here. By the time you get to ""Nun will ich jubeln,"" things fairly sizzle.

This production is plagued with cheapness, unfortunately, as well as some questionable decision making in production and direction. The blocking for camera is not great. However, once you get past the first scene, it's never boring. This film made me want to keep watching even though I was supposed to be doing something else, which is always a good sign. And, more often than not, the show was extremely exciting, even thrilling. I turned on the DVD just to see how it was, and, after a good laugh at the beginning and a few caustic comments, kept watching compulsively until the very end!

Other productions may be more consistent or artistically perfect, but this performance has the kind of thrilling moments which opera aficionados crave. That's why I gave it a high score. If you can look past the many, many imperfections, this performance delivers the visceral goods.",1478131200,2,3250,5.228406909788868
8612593,1,B00F65N42A,"I've known this work since I was a student in Vienna.  A musically brilliant DIE FRAU was presented with Bhm and the recording cast from the year before.  Since then I've seen DIE FRAU in most of the major opera houses in the world.  i know the work and have heard all of the great Strauss singers from the early 1950s in these roles.  Concerning this specific new DIE FRAU from Russia:  it's a disaster from beginning to end.  No point to write out musical reasons... if you don't know sloppy intonation, the weirdest German anywhere, indifferent characterizations, a production with the costumes continuously getting in the way of movement and comfort....well if you cannot hear or see these, then you deserve what you get.  There are so many other DIE FRAU dvds now available, but this isn't worth even a few pennies let alone your time for getting through this mess!",1415232000,,870,4.684210526315789
8612594,1,B00F65N42A,"Just as I won't bother to say anything the production or the musical performance, and I'll let everyone maintain whatever opinions he/she might have about the music and libretto. You might suppose, of course, that if I bought this DVD, it was because I expected something good. The fact is that the sound recording of this production is so horrible that I gave up after only 10 or 15 minutes. My guess is that it was recorded -- and filmed -- on equipment salvaged from the siege of Leningrad. The voices have the distant, timbre-less quality of what you'd hear from the last balcony of a large opera house with spotty acoustics. The instruments sound as if somebody recorded them with a single mike from a seat in the 10th row of the orchestra ... but against the wall, under the shadow of the boxes. There's no inter-penetration of voices and instruments. It's an insult to DVD opera buyers to offer such a travesty, which doesn't even have the excuse of being old.",1395273600,7,967,4.595375722543353
8612595,1,B00F65N42A,"This is a very disappointing release.  Unfortunately there is hardly anything positive to say about it except that the filming is generally good and appropriate, nice interplay between full stage and close-up (but see qualification below).

First, the singing is altogether indifferent.  Some of the voices seem pleasant, even interesting (for instance that of the Empress)  but only Barak actually sings what sounds vaguely like German.  Hofmannsthal's text is dramatic, poetic and specific and needs to be heard clearly.  The nurse in particular just utters a bunch of vague gutteral sounds, I am sorry to say she sounds a bit like she has marbles in her mouth, there is simply no clearly enunciated German there.  For me, the lack of clear diction throughout this performance is inexcusable in what purports to be an international production, if sung completely by Russians.  The acting, such as it is, mostly reminds me of the old Bolshoi performances, rather stiff and wooden.  When the Dyer's wife takes off and tries to act ""modern"" it is exaggerated and uncomfortable, definitely amateur; her voice also develops a troublesome wobble in the last act.  Much of the time the various singers are staring nervously at the conductor (and perhaps for good reason, see below).

With the acting and singing at a sub-par level, it is difficult to evaluate fairly Jonathan Kent's production. Kent has some notable other DVD releases (Turn of the Screw/ Glyndebourne and Tosca/Royal Opera London).  Here he opts for what looks like a Soviet era laundromat for the Dyer's shop which has interesting possibilities.  But then it is difficult to tell how that possibly relates to the exotic location of the South-Eastern Island Emperor and Empress which is composed chiefly of gigantic plants and padded doors with rather fantastic orientalizing costumes.  In the final scene this all comes together(?) when a bunch of oddly floating objects appears in the sky, ranging from a clothes washer to the Dyer's bed to the drooping roots of the exotic flowers and the padded imperial door.  There is an interesting and suggestive touch after the final quartet when the two couples retreat and a large group of what appear to be their progeny emerge, all dressed in contemporary clothes, old and young, rich and poor together--this presumably is meant as what happens when we care for one another across class and gender lines.  But it is hard to see how Kent otherwise envisions the relation and ultimate mingling of earthly and magical realms; this may be the result of the dark filming of the magical ones. (The Munich/Japanese/Sawallisch production is fantastically effective in this regard.) There are ugly large video projections of giant flying black birds, billowing clouds and crashing waves during the orchestral interludes.

Gergiev's typical fluttering conducting is given a rather menacing touch (not to mention his menacing mien) since instead of the traditional baton he sports what looks to me like a large sewing needle in his right hand (another reviewer calls it a toothpick which is a nicer idea). In general his interpretation of the score strikes me as angular, edgy and sharp, alongside some rather mushy flowing passages.  It hardly measures up to the romantic sweep, power and subtlety of the other DVD versions of this opera--Solti, Sawallisch and the magical Christian Thielemann. Also we are forced to look at repeated distracting shots of Gergiev's nervous conducting throughout the performance.

I kept hoping over the three and one half hours that this magnificent opera would somehow emerge from this pretentious Mariinsky production. But with almost no audible German singing, a staging that requires some serious acting and a rather dry and lackluster orchestra, it is hard for me to think of a more disappointing DVD/Blu-ray from what purports to be an opera house of international standing.  It will be a long time before I buy another over-priced Marrinsky release of anything but Russian material.",1388620800,7,4021,5.147465437788019
8612596,4,B00F65N42A,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift after having seen a performance at the Metropolitan Opera.  I am now somewhat obsessed with this score. (I also added the classic Karl Bhm recording, with its huge cuts.)  Admittedly, this is a difficult story to understand, and I liked the English synopsis very much: it not only gives plot details, but explains a few of the symbolic touches.  The production is terrific, for it really contrasts the fairy-tale world of the Emperor and Empress with the mundane world of mortals by updating Barak's hut to a very drab and dingy looking laundromat (something many of us have experienced, I'm sure).  Most of the spectacle and fantasy elements come from inventive lighting and digital projections upon a front scrim. (Only occasionally did I find the projections intrusive.)  The final scene is stunning, and stage director Jonathan Kent makes the point of the whole opera quite clear: it's about what it takes to be truly human.

Valery Gergiev's conducting is definitely peculiar (with a toothpick!?), but the Mariinsky orchestra plays brilliantly.  The singing and acting from the principals are somewhat spotty, but this is a tough sing to begin with. Avgust Amonov (Emperor) makes a lot of noise and not much music, and his onstage stiffness is not eased by his costume. Edem Umerov (Barak) gives a very good performance overall, though a touch more warmth would be welcome. Olga Sergeev (Barak's wife) acts with naturalness, but spreads the top of the voice more and more as the performance goes on; when she doesn't work so hard, she's quite good.
Olga Savova (Nurse) gives the most unified performance of the lot - well sung, with no camp in the characterization.  Mlada Khudoley (Empress) sings the role extremely well, but again, the costuming makes her look frumpy instead of ethereal. (As the daughter of Keikobad, the ruler of the spirits, she should be made to look more unnaturally pretty, or exotic. She's already far too human from the beginning.)

I would rather give this performance 3 1/2 stars, but because of the effectiveness of the production,  I'm o.k with giving it 4 stars.  It's a very nice addition to my growing fascination with Strauss' epic fairy tale.",1388534400,3,2223,4.932975871313673
8612597,4,B00F65N42A,"I have admired the Strauss/Hofmannstahl opera ""Die Frau ohne Schatten"" since I first heard orchestral excerpts as a teenager; hearing the complete opera only increased my regard. However, I have never been able to surrender completely to the way I have with Parsifal, Pelleas et Melisande, Don Giovanni, Otello, Lulu and, more recently, L'Amour de loin. Much of Strauss's music has a Wagnerian richness and nobility, but he also has those disturbing passages when his orchestra screams to no good effect. And there is something inherent in Hofmannstahl's libretto which I find vexes me. I just cannot see the elaborate test of these admittedly flawed characters set up by Keikobad as anything other than an abuse of power. And furthermore the assumption that couples who may not want children are necessarily selfish and unworthy I find reprehensible. There . . . I said what I have to say, and enough said! What you really want from me is an assessment of this production. I would give it a B+ to an A-. I found Valery Gergiev's conducting to be eloquent and spacious; he does not rush scenes nor does he allow this sprawling opera to drag. The closing act showed Gergiev, the orchestra and the two couples at their very best. The singing just soared and then it continued to soar and stayed up there in the empyrean until the final chords; my good mood and the audience's lasted through the long line of curtain calls as we showered the cast with our appreciation. However, not every scene matched the closing one in excellence. The tenor Avgust Amanov who sang the Emperor has a suitably heroic voice but his acting was so stiff that he was barely credible. Edem Umerov who sang Barak has the right mellow baritone voice for the part but he sang too softly until the closing act when his voice suddenly flourished. The two sopranos were quite good for the most part, but I have memories of more beautiful voices which interfered often. But about Olga Savova who sang the almost expressionistic role of the Nurse I have only the highest praise. She sang with a full, clear voice, capturing both the cunning and the devotion of this ambiguous character. Her acting was equally skillful. By the way, Keikobad indirectly orders her to steal a mortal woman's shadow and then punishes her at the end for fulfilling her mission. Talk about divine entrapment! Sorry, I earlier promised I wouldn't grouse about the libretto. The production is half magical and half grungy. The world of Barak and his wife is like something out of an old TV show, like the Honeymooners (remember that?). It's really depressing, because we are seeing it as she sees it. Barak, of course, sees it differently, but we never are given his point of view, only his wife's. I suppose this ugly set serves the reality of the storyline. But the world of the Emperor and Empress is truly magical. It reminded me of other Mariinsky Theater productions of Russian operas with their fantasy settings and fairy tale designs. Lighting and stage smoke are used creatively to enhance the sheer wonder of this pure world above the squalor of the mortal world way below. And since all the principals have been raised to this paradisal world, this is the setting which provides a beautiful background for the glorious singing of the last act. Believe me the last twenty minutes are stunning! But when the singing is over and the orchestral is playing Strauss's long fade-out, from back stage the director has couples of all ages, some twenty-something, others seniors and every age between, slowly walk forward to the edge of the stage in a tight crowd. These, of course, are all the couples who are supposed to unselfishly give birth to and raise children. But they sure don't look happy. I have rarely seen on a stage at the supposedly triumphant end of a drama so many dour faces and enervated movements. Does parenthood have to be seen as such a chore, such a sacrifice of joy, what were Strauss and Hofmannstahl thinking? Or is this the director's unflattering reaction to the opera's message? In any case, during the curtain calls, the audience was neither dour nor enervated. They responded with enthusiasm and delight, and I must admit I too was caught up in their rapturous approval. Valery Gergiev looks like a very, very happy man!",1387152000,9,4298,4.778225806451613
