4482669,5,B004VJJFNO,"There is something about a con man that only takes from the rich and gives to the poor, ok so it's him, that captures the adventure in all of us. Once caught, he turns his life around, sort of, and works with the FBI agent that caught him. This show has it all, drama, intrigue romance and humor. The acting is awesome and the characters are so believable, you want to invite them to your home for dinner.  White Collar is destined to be a classic, no doubt in my mind.
Sincerly,

4482670,5,B004VJJFNO,This show is outstanding. Keeps you entertained and captivated all the time.  Especially Neal's smile. =) The friendship that develops with Neal & Peter is great considering one is an FBI agent and the other an ex-con.  Highly recommend.  Definitely a must see!,1310083200,,261,5.023255813953488
4482671,4,B004VJJFNO,"I got the DVD's early, which I was impressed with, and the show itself is good (I only bought it after confirming that it's one of the cleanest shows ever) but then when I watched the gagreel, I discovered that it's not censored. The show is pretty much family-friendly, but the language in the gag-reel is foul and not fitting to be watched.",1308441600,5,342,4.444444444444445
4482672,5,B004VJJFNO,"I became addicted to White Collar from the very beginning. For those of you unfamiliar with the premise, a con artist escapes from prison, is caught by the FBI, and they enlist his assistance catching other white collar criminals (i.e. art thieves, jewelry thieves, etc). This set is a great deal for a wonderful television series. If you don't own either series, they both retail for about $40 apiece. Season two released only a week or so ago and season 3 just started on USA so you can very easily catch up if you have missed a few episodes. Great plot, great cast, and let's face it. Matt Bomer is serious eye candy for the ladies. Seriously though, the plot will keep everyone's attention and is well worth a watch.",1308009600,7,720,4.546153846153846
4482673,4,B004VJJFNO,"I don't think I've ever quite heard of a show quite like ""White Collar,"" in which the FBI decides to employ a brilliant criminal to help them bust other ""white collar"" criminals. While it has an intriguing new twist on the odd-couple cop show, it also has witty writing, a murky conspiracy within the FBI, and some excellent actors with plenty of chemistry.

While searching for a thief known as the Dutchman, FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) hears that gentleman thief/conman/counterfeiter Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer)-- who he put in prison -- has escaped, only to allow himself to be recaptured. Caffrey is desperate to find his girlfriend Kate, and so he makes Burke an offer: free him from prison, and he'll help him catch the Dutchman.

Though he's dubious about Neal, Peter reluctantly agrees. After only a few hours out, Neal has a new wardrobe, a luxurious apartment and a wealthy landlady who doesn't care that he's a former thief. And he's working for the FBI.

Together, the two of them work out countless white collar crimes, ranging from organ trafficking to political corruption, from a priceless Bible to Neil's old enemies. But Neil's real interest is in finding his girlfriend Kate, and a mysterious music box that holds the key to her fate -- as well as a long-buried secret tangled in a conspiracy within the FBI.

""White Collar"" elegant, smart and charming, to the point where you don't really care that it has some painfully unrealistic moments (trotting their only witness onto a rooftop party with the KILLER nearby?), and a few slow spots.  But the writers have a knack for winding together the one-off cases with an overarcing plot about a corrupt FBI agent who is conspiring against Neal and Peter.

There's plenty of hilarious dialogue (""It's a loft, seized in a DEA bust -- fifteen hundred square feet, service elevator. It's perfect!"" ""Is that a chalk outline?"" ""I'm sure they've cleaned that up by now"") and suspenseful little scenes where Neal and/or Mozzie disguise themselves to infiltrate secure places where the FBI can't go without a warrant.

But the show's heart is DeKay and Bomer. DeKay is a snappy, sharp-edged FBI agent willing to bend the rules to get the job done. And Bomer is a sort of 21st-century Remington Steele: boyishly handsome, clever, charming, refined, and a little bit rakish. At the same time, you really feel sorry for him because of a devastating loss he suffers.

There's also a solid supporting cast -- Tiffani Thiessen as Peter's loving, long-suffering wife, and Willie Garson as the hilarious Mozzie (""I just said that to a guy who enjoys killing people with his bare hands!""). Also good performances by Diahann Carroll and Noah Emmerich, as well as Marsha Thomason as a hard-nosed but kind FBI rookie.

It sounds like just another odd-couple cop show, but ""White Collar Seasons 1 and 2"" have excellent writing, acting and some grippingly suspenseful plots.",1306540800,23,2920,4.894736842105263
4482674,5,B004VJJFNO,White Collar isn't just about a guy being the best con man in the world and working for the FBI.  There are intricate interwoven storylines throughout the first season that keep you wanting more.,1319846400,,195,4.735294117647059

4482679,5,B004VJJFNO,"I have been hooked on White Collar since it's premiere episode and getting Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD together for the price of Season 2 was a terrific buy!  The only problem with DVDs is that the episodes are in odd numbers  (3 on some 5 on others) and have breaks in unusual places, such as not breaking at a season half break on the DVD.  It's not a big issue, just a quirky one.

Even with the quirks of the DVD, I love this show, it's sophisticated, interesting, and has characters that you really care about it. I have watched both seasons again on DVD and like them both just as much the second time. Great show and a great buy on the DVDs!",1311465600,,643,4.079365079365079

8443417,5,B004VJJFNO,"I was so incredibly excited to see White Collar debut back in the fall of 2009. The idea of a thief working for the government dates back to the late sixties, but hasn't been seen on television or the big screen since. This updated version is action-packed, romantic, and well written. Matt Bomer as the incorrigible Neal Caffrey rocks the screen with his suave, and just plain ""hot"" good looks. Matt sells the con-artist charm like he was born to play it! I highly recommend this show. It's pure entertainment.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requisition-For-A-Thief-Book-1-A-Diamond-for-the-Taking/dp/146996788X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requisition For: A Thief: Book 1- A Diamond for the Taking</a>",1329955200,,746,6.252427184466019
