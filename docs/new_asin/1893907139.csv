202229,3,1893907139,"I inherited this dvd from someone who decided not to pursue guitar.  I already knew several chords and a couple of strumming patterns.  Most of the songs are in the key of G major, but use more than 3 chords (G, C, D).  There are 3 chords emphasized, but a few more are also used periodically (Em, G7, D7, A7, B7).  All of the strumming is done with a pick, no fingerstyles.  It's easy to see what he is playing.  The type of music he plays is very limited.  With what i knew already and being able to play some simple songs, i still found this dvd challenging in some areas.  I liked working to get to a point where i could keep up with some of his fast editions of the songs (he first does it slow).  I really improved my ability to pick individual strings and learned how to do a few bass runs.  I did feel that the difference between the slow and fast versions on the last song were too vast.  There were also a few times that the tablature was written differently than what he was actually playing.  I am now going to look for a dvd with more styles of music and strumming, as well as fingerstyles.",1294444800,2,1103,4.126760563380282
202230,5,1893907139,"It's a very easy system and it's not confusing. I used to play bass by ear, but I haven't played for years.

This book is a great help. Now I'm learning to read music. I'm so glad I bought this. It's worth every penny. Oh, and get the book! You'll be happy you did.",1244678400,,265,3.9074074074074074
202231,5,1893907139,"I bought this for my nephew.  He wanted to learn how to play the guitar.  He didn't stick with it, but the information is easy to understand and follow.",1235779200,,152,4.206896551724138
202232,5,1893907139,I played the sax for a couple of years but then decided to pick up the bass.  This DVD gave me a good start as far as basic fundamentals that every begginer should know.  If you have never played the bass guitar this DVD is a great starting point.  I have been at it about a month and already I am starting to get a feel for it and have starting playing a few songs.,1138406400,7,366,3.8533333333333335
202233,5,1893907139,"Bert Casey's DVD starts off with simple things (as previous reviewer noted, three chords). However, it goes way beyond that by the end. The lessons build slowly and progressively in order to avoid beginner frustration/burnout. If you are diligent and practice every night for 15 to 30 minutes, you will be playing quite well within six months -- hey, there is no ""miracle method"" to get you playing acoustic guitar in three weeks. It takes work, but Bert Casey's method eventually pays off.

Note: This DVD focuses on bluegrass and flatpicking styles of guitar. Also note: There is a companion book that you should check out if you are serious about learning how to play guitar.",1096416000,22,678,4.844827586206897
202234,3,1893907139,"Overall, a decent introduction to playing acoustic guitar.  It begins with essential basics, like how to hold the guitar and the pick and how to strum.  It then proceeds to show the basic chords and then then the instructor plays and signs the songs (bluegrass standards most of which I'd never heard of:).
The entire videotape has a an on-screen timer counter running, handy for reviewing sections later, and there's a companion book which is useful. Its a bit short at 1 hour, I wish it proceeded to show other styles of picking, but for around $10, its a decent introduction for the complete beginner.",997833600,25,604,4.742857142857143

7801067,5,1893907139,This book allows someone who has never played the guitar to pick up the guitar and start learning how to play immediately.,1398729600,,122,4.590909090909091
7801068,4,1893907139,I wish Mr. Casey had begun with chords D and A7 rather than G and C otherwise I can recommend this primer.,1397347200,,106,3.8636363636363638
7801069,5,1893907139,I like it better than Rocksmith because it is the real thing.  You are playing real songs and notes and not just playing a game by rote and reaction to a visuel.  Anyone who is serious about playing with a band should consider this CD.,1394755200,2,235,4.2
