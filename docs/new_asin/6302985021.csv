I wonder that this title still needs some review, but I am doing this with a great pleasure. The movie is made according to Lou Cannon, who is President Reagan's biographer and Mr. Cannon wrote also a great book about Reagan and his many sides. The movie will tell and disclose many bhidden aspects of Reagan's service to his beloved nation  and you will see how brave he was while he fought and struggled for the peace around the world. He struggled and fought for the entrapped and enslaved nations within the Warsaw Bloc and the Evil Empire. I would call President Reagan as the Century Leader! Get the title while it is still available online!",970531200,5,739,4.514925373134329
