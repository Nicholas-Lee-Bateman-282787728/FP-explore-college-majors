Arrived really quickly. as descried - no hassles

2 flicks for 4 buck is pretty good VFM. - up to a point - there comes a point - as with any graph - where you go past the tipping point.

fortunately we're a ways off that point here.

Hard to put spoilers in comedy films - especially ones that lean heavily on the visuals.

If I'm honest I saw this WAAAAY back and sought it out for just the 'Cab Callow-esque) routine at what I remember as the ending. As a young 'un I laughed like a drain at it.

what a difference a lifetime makes.. The 'skits' I though so daring and fantastic now seem as old and tired as myself. To be fair though, AT THE TIME they were all that and a bag chips. And some of that occasionally peeps through. And the '....loose shoes' song whils not having the power to deprive me of breath for laughin anymore, still made me smile knowingly. Maybe because I've learned it all so very true.

As for the filp side film - bye bye baby, I fail to see what the connection is. the film is bilge of the first order. IT wasn't amusing, racy or, or, or... wel anything it was just pants. Quite what one woman would see in the male lead is beyond me let alone two.

And talk a bout a grind. cheese and rice it went on annoyingly the same UNFUNNY scenario several time over.

If it had been funny that would be excusable. Had it had any discernable eroticism/nudity, again that would have made a difference. But it didn't. It was just BORING.

The stars are all for a wonderful trip down memory lane. even if some of the pitstops are just wrong with 21st century outlook.

ACID TEST: would I buy it again/recommend? Yes but only the loose shoes part.",1449705600,,1720,4.204268292682927

I have been really disappointed in the past with Tunnelvision and Amazon Woman On The Moon, and I had read up that this was another one where they put a well known star that was in it on the front cover who only has a short appearance in the movie... ya know like how they slapped Jack Nicolson on the cover of ""Little Shop Of Horrors""

Well, I figured for 89 cents, I'm sure I wouldn't be to disappointed as it was cheap for a coffee coaster if it bombed.

However, now that I have finally seen it, it will never be a coffee coaster.

Sure enough, as suspected, Bill Murray is only in it for the blink of an eye, and his scene is not really that funny. But it does have some good jokes in it.

Not everything is on mark, and some of it really stinks, but it has it's moments.

I enjoyed the opening Huge scene. Particularly a line about how far he can p%$#. And other little things like that throughout the film like ""these guys know how to use there pom poms, but can they f%$#""?

My favorite was one of the closing acts, a guy wakes up and cant get any from his wife, his shoes won't fit, and his bathrooms iced over, so that night he sings a great song about.

Well, thats the review of the movie, 3 stars for the film. It's not Kentucky Fried Movie, but it's far better then Tunnelvision & Amazon Woman On The Moon.

The quality of the film seems to be taken right off of a VHS or Beta tape. You can see the static lines now and then and even distorts for a second before it comes back. But, I can not see anyone demanding that this thing be restored to theater quality or remastered in 5.1, so it is what it is and it's better thing nothing. And I paid under a dollar for it, so how can you really complain about that.

The DVD I got came as a flip side with Bye Bye Baby on the other side of it. The Menu features the usual play all or chapter selection and also includes a small biography of 3 actors and the director, and also has a cheap little quiz game to play! Ten question about the movie, to see if you can get 100%... nothing special about it, but it's ok.

No subtitles, the sound can be pretty bad in some areas, the quality of the film is not the best, but the thing is watchable, turn the volume up and have a laugh, it gives you more then 89 cents worth of laughs, guaranteed!

- Bye Bye Baby... I dunno what these two movies have in common. I tried to watch it, but turned it off. I used to watch Thunder In Paradise, but it's still not enough to make me watch Carole Alt in whatever the hell this movie was about. I have no idea why they have put these two movies on flip sides of each other, but hey, for 89cents, I'll take it.",1199577600,,2855,4.007042253521127
