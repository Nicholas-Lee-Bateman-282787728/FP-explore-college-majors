8300569,1,B001F0TT74,"Unstructured French road film with a totally unbelievable plot structure. Sergi Lopez is appealing in his role as half of this hitchhiking twosome, but the actor playing the Russian sidekick is merely annoying. It is 133 minutes long, and the humor in it is sparse. Pass on this one.",1524355200,,283,4.795918367346939
8300570,5,B001F0TT74,"Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival 1997. A great film, with great actings. Sergi Lpez and Sacha Bourdos are hilarious. Excellent dvd quality!",1393718400,,161,5.0
8300571,4,B001F0TT74,"A fun and uplifting story. One never knows what will happen next, and the characters keep evolving throughout the entire movie. Definitely worth watching.",1361577600,,154,5.458333333333333
8300572,3,B001F0TT74,"Two emigrants, of the USSR and Spain, crossed over somewhere in a French country-side.

A Spaniard is naturally more sex-active and job-established, while a cone ""Russian"" is second-year studying the free world opportunities and landed in hospital, practicing a course.

Than things changed and what, probably, links this very-British-multination-story-on-a-Fench-landscape with comedy genre is two these lads sitting at the dinner table surrounded by near a soccer team of kids this woman gave birth to from different males met.

TOOOOOOOOO long movie.",1321488000,,553,5.802469135802469
8300573,3,B001F0TT74,"This was a pleasant french film. Through a set of unusual circumstances, two men end up hitchhiking through the countryside, looking for love and a little lust, meeting people and a few beautiful women, building a friendship together along the way, and learning something about life from each other. The pace of the story is consistent throughout, by no means action-packed, and there are no intense plot conflicts to figure out; it's just a pleasant story with interesting characters that one can enjoy and in places relate to their feelings. My only criticism is that the story ended rather abruptly, leaving a little bit unresolved.  Some movies do this on purpose; this one rather felt like they ran out of time.",1295913600,,716,4.917355371900826
