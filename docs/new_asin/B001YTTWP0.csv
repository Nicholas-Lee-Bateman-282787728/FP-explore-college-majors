3829874,4,B001YTTWP0,"A smart, funny, well-executed Korean ""western"" taking place in Manchuria durning the Japanese expansionist wars of the 1930's.

Although the title and basic plot advertise the film's thematic connection to Leone's ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"", there are tons of references to other Leone films: notably ""Fistful of Dollars"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".  These references are subtle and don't parody the original Leone scenes so much as cleverly augment a refreshingly original execution of a common plot device.

Beyond the western trappings, it's a quintessentially Asian film with quirks, editing and cinematography more characteristic of east-Asian cinema than mainstream Hollywood productions.

That said, a common complaint is the film's uneven pacing and overdose of action scenes.  While every gunfight is superbly executed in its own right, the movie's remarkable energy becomes almost draining by the final climax.",1259712000,,933,5.496503496503497

3829876,3,B001YTTWP0,"The film itself is worth every penny.  It's a great, great, great film, but the DVD is just okay.  In fact, the menu appears as if it were made very hastily.  I wish there were some features about the making of the film, which the DVD lacks.  The film gets 5 stars, the product 3.",1253318400,5,280,4.036363636363636
3829877,4,B001YTTWP0,"n the surface, Kim Ji-Won's (""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" ""A Bittersweet Life"") 2008 film, ""The Good, The Bad & the Weird,"" is clearly a homage to Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns, but it also draws much inspiration, in terms of tone and temperament, from much more lighthearted fare like Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones"" films.

Shot in Western China near the Gobi Desert, the film is set in a harsh, flat landscape that could just as easily stand in for the American Southwest circa 1860, as well as Manchuria in the 1930's. Into this inhospitable terrain has come, it seems, every Korean thief, gunfighter and gangster, all fleeing the brutality of the Japanese Occupation of Korea (1910-1945), including: a noble, if cold-blooded, bounty hunter Do-Weon (""The Good,"") played by Woo Sung Jun (the heroic former slave in ""Musa the Warrior,""); a vicious, if terribly insecure, urban gangster turned train robber, Park Chang-Yi (""The Bad""), played by Rom-Com hearthrob Lee Byeong-heon (who surprised many audiences with his portrayal of a young gangster in ""A Bittersweet Life""), and Sang Kang-Ho (who has given great lead performances in lauded Korean dramas like ""Joint Security Area,"" ""Memories of Murder,"" and ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,"") who carries much of the film with his comedic portrayal of Yoon Tae-Gu (""The Weird""), a doofus of a bandit, who kicks off the action by making off with a priceless Q'ing Dynasty treasure map.

It's the race for said map, by mercenaries hired by pro- and anti-Japanese forces, as well as local thieves and roving bands of bandits, that drives the story, as seen in lively, extended action-packed set pieces: a bloody train robbery, a crazed gun battle in a sprawling desert marketplace, and a wild horse-motorcycle-jeep & truck chase across miles of territory. There is very little depth here (which is a tad disappointing given the films huge budget and 130 minute running time), but on the whole, the film is an enjoyable ride, loaded with sharp, often funny characterizations, elaborate and intense action scenes, and a general good humor that lends a welcome bouyancy to the often crazed proceedings. The movie should easily sate the appetite of almost all action movie fans, prime yourself for a fun fast moving ride through shallow waters and you should do fine.",1242432000,9,2310,5.076315789473684

3829879,4,B001YTTWP0,"My expectations for this film were through the roof. It's basically a Korean all-star game: directed by Ji-woon Kim, he of A Bittersweet Life and A Tale of Two Sisters fame (not to mention The Quiet Family), and starring three of Korea's finest (or at least most popular) actors, Woo-sung Jung, Byung-hun Lee, and (one of my favorite actors, Korean or otherwise) Kang-ho Song.

The production values are top notch, the direction creative and self-assured, the special effects worth the time and money spent on them. I love the kill scenes as directed by Kim, especially one of the first ones where a tough guy is running from train car to train car, bursting through doors like they don't exist and then BAM! He's five feet behind where he was. You have to see it to appreciate it, I guess. The timing and the focus on the result instead of the impact makes the impact seem more impactful. Whoever edited this film did a great job.

Woo-sung Jung plays the Good, and he's a cute guy who oozes goodness, so that's good. His character is perhaps a bit under-played/under-developed but that's the nature of Good, isn't it? Byung-hun Lee as the Bad has a little bit too much contemporary in his swagger and look. He's more arrogant than Bad, but we're supposed to dislike him so that's good too. Not surprisingly, it's Kang-ho Song, as the Weird, who steals the show. He runs through this movie like a chicken or a turkey with its head cut off but never misses a beat. He's having a good time and makes sure that we do too. He's able to do things that many other actors are incapable of like delivering predictable lines with equal parts sincerity and irony so that we won't even think of groaning out loud. He's so adorably slightly plump and likeable that even when ... well, I don't want to give it away ... we like him. We really do.

Caught up in all the fun and excitement I almost forgot that, with very few exceptions, movies with lots of gun fights are stupid.

I have nothing against remakes. But this isn't a really remake. This one's got Weird, the other one had Ugly. And they do different stuff in this one but the basic story arc is similar.",1241654400,,2152,4.4961636828644505
3829880,4,B001YTTWP0,"Small wonder that after director Kim Jee-Woon's magnificent ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" and the terrific ""A Bittersweet Life"" that his next film would be so eagerly anticipated. ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird"" has won numerous awards in Asia, achieved box-office acclaim in South Korea and has been selected for the Cannes film festival. I've said before that an Asian western isn't exactly an original concept; there was a video game called ""Western Samurai"", the Hong Kong produced ""Peace Hotel"" and most recently, Takashi Mike's ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" from Japan. Well, it seems like South Korea won't be left behind and with Kim Jee-Woon at the helm, expectations are rather high and the man doesn't disappoint.

A two-bit bumbling crook named Tae-Goo ""The Weird"" (Song Kang-Ho, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) robs a train only to unintentionally make off with a Quing Dynasty treasure map. Everyone wants this map; the Japanese army, the Korean independence group as well as a lot of shady characters. On Tae-goo's tail is a relentless killer named Park Chang-Yi ""The Bad"" (Lee Byung-Hyun, A Bittersweet Life) who is also after the map and has a seemingly personal reason as to why he wants Tae-Goo's head on a plate. In hot pursuit for both of them is a bounty hunter named Park Do-Won (Jung Woo-Sung, The Restless) who can do nicely with the bounty for Chang-Yi's capture or the treasure itself. Now, these three men are on a collision course--who would win out in the end?

Kim Jee-Woon's ""The Good the Bad the Weird"" is an extremely well-made film and is a highly entertaining genre-busting affair. This chaotic period similar to the wild west in America, a Machuria-set ""kimchi"" western (as opposed to ""spaghetti"" or even ""sukiyaki"") is a melting pot of all things awesome about westerns and looks like a homage to Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"". There's a train heist, lots of shoot-outs in a small town and cool characters. You'll see bits and pieces of ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" (so obvious with the film's title), ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and even Miike's ""Sukiyaki Western Django"". The film has a very large budget and it shows, the film is exquisitely shot and the superb style and camerawork reminded me of Ryuhei Kitamura (Azumi). Director Kim definitely knows his stuff in style and with the film's intriguing concept, Asian and Korean cinema fans have reason to see this film, and it is definitely something that a ""solid"" Asian film fan just can't miss.

The film's set designs and architecture maintain some of that ""dynasty-era"" Korean period but it does have a strong touch of the old west. It has some rather creative touches; there is some swordplay, knives used with brutality, there's a big guy with a huge hammer, a ""sleeping Buddha"" under construction, rifles with telescopes, motorcycles and jeeps, saloons and more--all these contribute to the film's ""mixing of genres"" style. Director Kim also seems to be having a lot of fun with the film, as he never forgets his touches of humor to help the film's pace and his stunning camerawork which proves to be the film`s showstopper. Explosions and gunfire are aplenty; highlights include a very cool town gunfight and a very long chase sequence with the ensembled cast supported by dozens and dozens of extras. I've read that Kim actually had cameramen hanging on wires to shoot the desert scenes--Kim Jee-Woon's talent shines through.

The action scenes are very exciting and exquisitely executed. It looks like director Kim took some pointers from Ryuhei Kitamura because they are just so full of ""coolness"" that can make action scribe John Woo a little jealous. Kim also avoids the use of CGI in the action and depends mostly on elaborate stunts and old-fashioned camera trickey; there is minimal use of CGI enhanced effects but only in the film's set designs. Ok, so some scenes required a large suspension of disbelief, I rather found Jung Woo-Sung's Do-Won's skills with a gun a little too over-the-top especially when he engages a large number of the Japanese army. He never even gets grazed by a bullet so either Do-Won is unbelievably good or these guys just supremely suck. But hey, this is a minor complaint, after all I don't think this film was meant to be taken seriously and more of a homage film. Hey, please take note that Kim doesn't hold back with the blood--and the way he executes it kept the film from having too much of that ""comic bookish"" feel. There is also a legend of a certain ""Finger chopper"" that gives some surprises and I felt that the screenplay played its cards well.

Song Kang-Ho's Tae-Goo arguably steals the show and proves to be the film's most interesting character--the actor also proves as to why he is one of South Korea's most sought after performers. The man can act in almost any film I've seen that further cements his reputation in versatility. Lee Byung Hyun does have the most intense presence onscreen, his character along with Song Kang-Ho's Tae-goo are the kind of characters that can elevate the film into ""cult status"". Jung Woo-Sung's ""the Good"" character feels a little too cool and lacks precision, but the actor does do the best with what he has. Still, the three popular actors mesh very well and has dynamic chemistry. Oh, the women are also great-looking and serves to titillate the male audience.

""The Good, The Bad, The Weird"" is a very polished film that lived up to my expectations. The film's plot isn't too deep, but the film's ""wow"" factor is just so incredibly impressive that I can look pass the very simple plot which makes it essentially a chase film. It is a solid film, that exudes popcorn entertainment but its characters do carry much of the film's weight. It may be little too pre-occupied in becoming captivated with itself but its small flaws aren't really worth to nitpick. The film is an action-packed affair that action junkies will never become bored--as for the rest, they can find something else to like in the film--its characters, style and performers will definitely impress. I'm happy to say that Kim Jee-Woon's film lived up to the hype.

Highly Recommended! [4 - Stars]

Note: The 3-disc Korean region-3 release has both the theatrical uncut Korean version and the International version which may arguably be a better paced, leaner film. The Korean cut has more development to Tae-goo's character and some extra scenes in the end. Luckily both versions are available in the Korean dvd release.",1237075200,7,6468,4.868301544050863

3829888,5,B001YTTWP0,"The Good, The Bad, The Weird is a movie Ive been meaning to see for at least 6 years. I first read about it on a dvd review site and it sounded awesome. For no reason, I never got around to it, despite it being in my queue for so long. The other night, I gave in and finally gave it a shot, and man was I surprised. Not only is this one of the best movies Ive seen this year, its one of the most fun to watch. This is one of those rare action movies that manages to keep a steady pace, never have a dull moment, not have any forced dramatic moments just to make itself serious for a moment, and at the same time pays tribute to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly in a fantastic way.

Regarding the story, this sucker is all over the place and I can only really tell you the basics. Theres a treasure map somewhere on a train, and the best hitman out there, Park Chang-yi, is sent to recover it. Before he can, Yoon Tae-goo, an odd bandit, manages to get it and make it off the train alive. At the same time, a mysterious cowboy, Park Do-won, shows up in hopes of collecting the bounty on Chang-yi. Yoon Tae-goo thinks hes in the clear, but is eventually captured by Park Do-won, and they come to a semi-agreement that theyll both look for the treasure and split it 40-60. Elsewhere, Chang-yi is beginning to get upset that Yoon Tae-goo got away, for various personal reasons. More becomes clear as the movie goes on, and you learn a lot about each character, enough to the point where you might end up siding with everyone. The journey for the treasure is long and takes the characters through deserts, a crowded market town, a seemingly relaxing hotel, and more.

All three characters really do live up to their titles of Good, Bad and Weird. Yoon Tae-goo has this weird way of running around and doing basic things like sneaking up on people. He reminded me a lot of Wario from the Nintendo games in how some of his actions were. Park Chang-yi gets your attention in every scene hes in. The actor who plays him, Lee Byung-hun, does an excellent job of looking deranged while not overdoing it, and still acting like a normal person at times. I actually wish there were more scenes with him. This movie is over 2 hours long and while hes in there a good amount, it really does feel more like Yoon Tae-goos movie than anyone elses. I really liked Park Do-won and his seemingly invincible horse, riding through explosions and gunfire like its nothing. He captures a lot of the classic movie cowboy mannerisms perfectly and never crosses into John Wayne territory. There are some secondary characters that show up now and then, and there are a couple of memorable ones (well-dressed bandits on horses), but this movie is all about the three main characters, and Im thankful for that.

Where the movie shines is the action. I was surprised to find out that its rated R, as it doesnt have THAT much gore. In fact, a lot of kills are similar to old westerns, where people just fall down when they get shot. Sure, there are a couple of brutal deaths, but the camera never focuses on them, and more is implied than shown. This could easily be a PG-13 film. You get tons of shootout scenes that are actually meaningful and have some memorable bits. Just when you think one sides about to go down, another group shows up and both sides have to start all over. The final chase sequence though, is a sight to behold. Youd think the entire world was at war with how it goes down. On top of all this action is a killer soundtrack, full of classical guitar and surf music riffs thrown into the mix. It kills me to see that the soundtrack is so hard to get now and goes for big bucks, because its quickly become one of my favorites. Finally, something that I wondered about until near the end- its very hard to figure out when the heck this movie takes place, but 2/3 through, its revealed big time. I have no problems with this, but if they hadnt included the groups that they did, this could easily have taken place in its own world or alternate timeline.

I tend to dread watching movies that are over the hour and a half mark these days. The Good, The Bad, The Weird though, never once felt like it was 2+ hours long. I didn't want it to end. It may not be the absolute best Ive seen this year, but its definitely in my top 5. Western fans or people who just want some fun action are in for a treat here.",1449792000,3,4388,4.2895054282267795

If he were still alive, he would have loved this one.  No special effects.  It's all the actors doing the work, not stunt people.  They even had to take horse riding lessons in advance. It was filmed in China and the weather was brutal.  Kudos to the actors and entire film crew for a job well done.

The Good:  Played by Jung Woo-Sung.  He did an excellent job as the bounty hunter.  I was totally impressed with his horse riding skills while shooting a rifle that he cocked while spinning it.  At a full gallop, while standing in the stirrups.  He has the classic cowboy look and it looked great on him.

The Bad:  Played by Lee Byung-hun.  He made a fantastic bad guy that was slightly psychotic and totally driven to be the best bad guy ever.  He likes playing with knives and is a quick draw  dead shot with a gun. Dresses in a pin stripe blue suit and is a bit fussy about his hair.  Antagonist to The Weird.

The Weird:  Played by Sung Kang-ho.  He was definitely weird, but there's layers of stuff going on behind all of that that weirdness.  He drives the vintage side car motorcycle, dresses like a cross between a nomad and a steam punk.  Antagonist to The Bad.

Throw in random other bad guys, the Chinese Army, vintage side car motorcycles, gangs, drugs, train robberies, double dealing, horses, guns, huge chase scenes with panoramic views along with a bunch of other stuff and it totals up to AWESOME.  It was a well acted, well directed and well produced movie.  I've already watched it twice and will be watching it again real soon after I get a recliner to park in front of my big screen TV.

They go into great lengths to explain how it is made and extraordinary detail on the costumes, animals, the actors, the behind the scenes people...  If that isn't enough, then it is worth watching again.  Highly, highly recommended.  Lots of action and funny too.

They do things in here that Hollywood does not and puts American film making to shame.  We are this pro-Second Amendment country and the South Koreans get it right.  They know their firearms, and when they are fired, they don't all sound the same; different calibers and types of firearms go ""BOOM"" differently and you hear that in this film.  For those of us you have had firearms training, understand the proper ways to handle guns.  American films/shows almost always, good or bad characters, hold their firearms wrong and rarely reload.  This film, you see a character holding a gun wrong and paying the consequences, and not only reloading, but also doing so on horseback.  You cannot give this movie enough stars, the authenticity is fantastic.",1407024000,6,1154,4.917098445595855

I wanted to root for one of the characters in particular, but then a late-game revelation made me think twice about who I was cheering on. This is the kind of film that takes its time setting up action sequence after action sequence, fantastically shot and entertainingly made, but the ending seriously made me scratch my head. It simply happens; afterwards there's little explanation given. Also.....

(spoilers)

It's difficult for me to believe that the character of Tae-Goo has settled into his new surroundings without anyone knowing his former past as the ""finger chopper."" Everyone knows that he was in a duel with Chang-Yi, but Tae-Goo doesn't remember this at all during the film. Which means he's either ignoring it, or everyone knows he's the Finger Chopper, or they don't, or -- confusion. And then the ending gives no explanations. It just ends.

Horses, motorcycles, and jeeps abound without any explanation.  There were times when I laughed out loud because I wasn't expecting something.

It is a fine send-up of the Western genre, with special parody of the spaghetti western, and the direction is expert and interesting. The whole thing takes place in the Manchurian desert before World War II, and it manages to include a number of people all of whom are after a treasure map which is supposed to lead to a trove buried by the Qing Dynasty.

I absolutely loved the 'Americanized' slang they used throughout, it added to the comedic atmosphere. I thought perhaps this would be a spoof on an Eastwood movie, and I suppose it could have been. But this movie was very humorous, and the mixture of horses and 1940's military vehicles was kinda weird, but doggone it, this thing just worked. The vistas of China and the Gobi desert really made this feel like the 'Old West', and the cinematography ws well done. It reminded me of some of the later American westerns that included automobiles in the correct period. I really enjoyed it, and it stayed pretty true to not only what I would expect from a western in general, but also what I was hoping for in an Asian comedy/western. Yes, it has some pretty good action scenes, and it is not entirely a comedy, it just winds up being pretty funny because the actors did such a fine job. This was a gamble for me, thought I might get a Jackie Chan wannabe, but I was HAPPILY wrong- this movie is pretty darned good!
4 stars, though, because I just couldn't understand why a motorcycle or a military jeep could't go faster than a horse- those parts were pretty unbelievable. Worth watching twice!",1382140800,,1306,4.585470085470085

What made this movie a complete surprise was that it almost seemed like a livelier reboot. In place of the slower parts of the original version, this movie has an excellent mixture of plot pacing, action, and comedy. Characters are not cliche'd and actually reveal depth to themselves throughout the movie.

The only downside is that some folks might not like having to read English subtitles, but I tend to be biased and not care since I'm a huge fan of foreign flicks.

I think someone in Korea watched the Clint Eastwood spaghetti  westerns (probably The Good, Bad, and Ugly), and then wrote their own script using Manchuria for their wild East.  The movie takes place probably in the late 1930's, and, if you don't take it seriously (or are on some sort of mild drug), it can be kind of funny and entertaining.  The plot, if you can call it one, concerns a treasure map that four different groups (gangsters, individuals, Japanese military) seek.  The train robbery was quite strange; three different groups or individuals were trying to rob it at the same time, creating mayhem at times.  Horses, motorcycles, and Japanese military vehicles (and the trains) are the main transportation.  Lots of shooting, quite a few  casualties, and some interesting vendettas (especially at the end, when they have the three gunman in a tri shoot out, much like Good, Bad, and Ugly).",1377216000,,994,4.875

3830005,5,B001YTTWP0,"Imagine a American Western film, but set it in the early Twentieth Century, include bandits and mysterious bounty hunters, petty thieves, train robbery and a treasure map. Now drive it over the top so that it includes all types of weapons and modes of transportations, like swords and machine guns mounted on jeeps and motorbikes. Now, move it all and drop it in Manchuria, at this point you might be close to imagining the Korean film The Good, The Bad, The Weird. When I say that the film is set in the 1930's, when Japan was controlling Manchuria and Korea, do not take that to mean that there is any historical accuracy in this film at all. It has the historical accuracy of an Indiana Jones film with the same crazy stunts. Also, like an Indiana Jones film it revolves around a treasure that everyone is trying to find.

 The three main characters are the The Good, Park Do-won, played by Jung Woo-sung. Many foreign film viewers might remember him as Yeo-sol, the slave in Musa. Park Do-won is a bounty hunter after The Bad and The Weird. The Bad, Park Chang-yi, played by Lee Byung-hun, who many Americans will know as Storm Shadow from the G.I. Joe franchise. Park Chang-yi is a hired gun with a gang that is paid to go after the train carrying the map. However, someone gets to the map before he does, by just a few minutes. The Weird, Yoon Tae-goo, played by Song Kang-ho, who some might know from The Host, is a petty thief who by pure coincidence robs the train that Park Chang-yi is trying to rob. All the while Park Do-won has hidden himself among the passengers to catch Park Chang-yi. When Yoon Tae-goo makes a run from the train with the map, both Chang-yi and Do-won follow, thus starting what is one of the greatest chase movies of all time, which includes a scene with one lone motorcyclist being chased by a horde of comprised of three different groups of armed men riding everything from horses to jeeps.

 This is not a movie for dramatists, there is no character development or touching scenes of inner turmoil or revealing inner depths. The characters are what they are, and while two-dimensional at times, they're never boring. Jung Woo-sung, like his chacarter in Musa, does a silent good guy with the best of them. In this film he is more like an acrobatic Clint Eastwood. Lee Byung-hun plays a great villain, cold blooded, dressed in black, the classic badass who murders his own men if they disappoint. The film is billed as an action-comedy, and that is mainly because of Song Kang-ho, who doesn't tell jokes but uses his skills as a physical comedian. His character goes through action sequence after action sequence seeming to stay alive by pure luck, like falling down at the right time. The music might also be a comedic element, though it is very well done. The film is filled with a fast paced, Spanish guitar led Mariachi score. Though the score is quite good, it does bring to mind Spaghetti Westerns and mixed with the films locale, a more techno beat and the great timing of score it became pretty entertaining by itself. While none of this is really funny, it is fun.

 This movie is not for purists of any kind either. As mentioned early, it is not historical accurate. Also, don't bother counting bullets, or determining the physics behind the shots taken. We all know someone who ruins movies by pointing out that the firearm being used doesn't hold that many bullets and would have needed to be reloaded. They will also say things like, ""No way he could've made that shot! That is impossible!"" Yes, it is, that is why it is in the movie. Some people might nit-pick at some of the CGI effects. There are not many, but they are somewhat cartoonish. They don't spoil the fun and the movie is not CGI heavy, so it was easy to overlook. Like so many good Asian action films The Good, The Bad, The Weird, is meant to be a circus performance with a story to piece it together. It is just pure fun, treat it no other way.",1374019200,,3959,4.522346368715084

3830021,4,B001YTTWP0,"This self-dubbed ""kimchee western"" wears its inspiration on its sleeve, throws caution to the wind and just goes for it. And, unexpectedly, it's an almost-unanimous success. Although it's spiced by a fresh, eastern sense of direction and a series of ""did they really just try that"" camera angles, the mood feels right, the scenery looks right and the cast is right at home on horseback with their weapons drawn, cocked and pointed. It's much gorier than the Leone classics it tries to emulate, which makes it a bit less serious, but the three leads make up for that with their performances. Woo-sung Jung (The Good) is the standout, channeling Lee Van Cleef's lawful bounty hunter in Fistful of Dollars, but Kang-ho Song (The Weird) keeps him in good company with his impersonation of Eli Wallach's smarter-than-he-seems rogue from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Byung-hun Lee (The Bad) seems more like Prince in cowboy boots than a western gunman, but he does more to make the role his own than the others. A fine blend of big-budget action and last-generation western ethos, it's just a bit long and the constant winks and nods to The Man With No Name trilogy occasionally wear thin.",1367971200,,1186,4.818627450980392

3830031,3,B001YTTWP0,"I admit I had higher expectations for this movie than it delivered.  It's not bad at all, and especially impressive is the cinematography, with a definite Tarantino type of feel.  What I was somewhat let down by was the last 40 minutes or so and the conclusion.  It just seemed the writing and story editing didn't keep pace with the higher quality production and filming.

I'm semi-familiar with Korean movies, having spent a bit of time in South Korea in the 90's and early 00's, and I've witnessed a definite maturation of their whole Korean film-making industry.  Because of that, I ordered this movie with moderately higher hopes than were met.  Given the first half of the movie, I wasn't disappointed.  Kang-ho Song, who plays the titular role of ""the Weird"" and played a similar role in ""the Host"" is pretty hilarious in his delivery, and helps keep the comedic momentum moving with his performance.  Likewise the editing keeps the story moving along at a good pace.  The character of ""the Bad"" is a little over-the-top, and seems a little too modern for the story setting (especially his haircut), but he fits well-enough with the mood of the movie as a whole, so I could tolerate him easily enough.  ""The Good"" is the character least explored in this movie, and by the end, I really didn't care whether he lived or died.  There's a slight plot twist and shoot-out at the end (following a LARGE, unnecessarily long, multi-party chase and gun-fight), but the whole story set-up just didn't conclude in any kind of satisfying way.

All-in-all, not a bad movie, but a lot of potential wasn't explored.  What started out much more on parity with Tarantino somewhat slipped into ""almost parody"" by the end of the movie.  Great shot at the target, but it just didn't quite hit it.

The scene where the ""Weird"" shoots it out with the bad guys in a town full of outlaws in Manchuria while wearing an old brass diving helmet is worth the price of admission alone.  The film is a takeoff/homage to....I'll let you guess.  The setting in Asia's Wild West - Manchuria - right before World War 2 is intriguing and there are numerous off the cuff references to the Korean independence movement (from Japan), the way the Japanese were (are?) seen by the Chinese and Koreans  -""Kill them all!"" a Japanese officer orders his troops when confronted by a confusing mix of Chinese, Korean and Manchurian outlaws.  The interplay of the three main characters, all big stars in Asia, is well-scripted, the action scenes are clever and originally staged and.....it's a great film!

This is what I watch action movies for - and after a spate of sluggish, bloated superhero ""blockbusters,"" I was feeling pretty burnt out on action movies. This film restored my waning faith in the action/adventure genre.

The story is simple and the film doesn't waste much time with it. There is a map to a mythical treasure in 1930s Manchuria. Everyone wants it, from the Japanese Army to gangs of Korean rebels and mobsters. The principal characters in the race for the treasure, however, are:

The Good: a no nonsense character reminiscent, of course, of Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name.
The Bad: the most legendary assassin in Manchuria.
The Weird: a petty thief with a mysterious past.

Once the movie gets the story out of the way, it confidently follows the encounters and adventures of these three men. The film is a tribute to Westerns, kung fu acrobatics, and outrageous stunts - but it frames them so well, so gleefully, that the movie seems fresh rather than rehashed. The actions scenes here are the star of the show: shootouts that dare to dream big, and continously top themselves until the spectacular final act: a very long (but never boring) chase through the desert when all the map-seeking factions collide.

I've said enough. If you like Westerns, foreign films, action movies, or just fun movies that don't take themselves too seriously, go see this. I promise you'll have a blast. Typing this is just making me want to go watch it again.",1339027200,,1561,4.706959706959707

Yoon Tae-Goo aka The Weird is first to get his hands on the map unintentionally aboard a train, stealing it from the Japanese army. Hot on his heals aboard the train is Park Chang-Yi aka The Bad a hit man hired to retrieve the map. Looking for both men is Park Do-Won aka The Good a bounty hunter looking t cash in. As The Weird makes his way across the desert with the map all parties involved follow suit and the war begins for the map. The quest to whatever treasure may at the end of the map is one wild and violent ride, but a fun one.

Director Kim Jee-Woon who you may remember from his films like ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""I Saw the Devil"" and of course ""A Bittersweet Life"" really delivers here. Visually this is one of the best films I have ever watched. The camera keeps moving and the visuals are stunning, from sets to props to just everything on screen. It is no wonder that the film has won numerous awards including for the acting. Song Kang-Ho is excellent as the weird and adds so much to this film, he and the character are very charismatic. Lee Byung-hun is absolutely brilliant as The Bad in my opinion and just comes off as the perfect villain. Then of course there is Jung Woo-sung who plays The Good with an almost outlaw like coolness to him. That of course makes him feel a bit more like the people he chases and that adds a little edge to him.

These three guys mesh so well together and make for a perfect on screen team of actors. Add in the over the top action and comedy and you have a really good time. This really is one of the most fun films I own and I can honestly say I have watched it multiple times. In fact I can say that both versions or should I say cuts of the film are really good, although they end rather differently. Also the entire cast here was great as was all involved because the finished product is very well done.

You know it feels like I am over praising this film but I really do enjoy this flick. Everyone that I have shown this to have loved the flick. In fact people that I convinced to watch this on Netflix ending up liking it so much they went out to buy it. The DVD/Blu-Ray comes with all kinds of great special features so I really do recommend buying this. So with all that said I say check this flick out right now, you may not love it like I do but I am sure you will like it.",1334102400,4,2944,4.104166666666667
3830043,4,B001YTTWP0,"A beautifully shot foreign action film from Korea that is a slick visual stunner: great use of color, lighting, and cinemaphotography/camera angles. Despite its high-brow looks the action is still there, done very well, and is almost non-stop. If you want realism or grit in your movies however this one ain't for you. Instead it has just enough fun and humor to put it into the same genre as Big Trouble in Little China&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Trouble-in-Little-China-Blu-ray/dp/B0028ZDJF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Trouble in Little China [Blu-ray</a>], although nowhere near as over the top.

The story line is completely different, and is essentially an asian remake of ""The Good, The Bad, and the The Ugly"" combined with the chase-comedy classic ""Its a Mad Mad World"". Doesn't matter much if you've never seen those, it still stands very well on its own. Aside from a VERY long chase scene at the end that starts out good but overstays its welcome, this is a very entertaining movie if you take it for what it is and are willing to suspend belief for a couple hours.  The stunts are top notch, but put an emphasis on style over reality.

If you are going back and forth based on the somewhat goofy DVD cover, the use of the word ""weird"" in the title, or the fact that it is a Korean movie, definitely put those doubts aside and pick it up. For a Korean film this is a big budget production and a lot of fun.",1332028800,,1472,4.951417004048583

3830046,3,B001YTTWP0,"Lots of non stop action in this frenetic movie. It's like the characters were all hyperactive kids who then grew up and amped up the hyperactivity with caffeine and steroids and then became overly violent.  The sets were kind of surreal, the violence was over the top, the characters did not seem like real people and the storyline was rather thin. I found it kind of dragged on too long and the ending was disappointing but the movie was definitely something very different and for that reason I watched the whole thing. I watched it initially because it had the actor Song Kang-ho in it but I must say I liked him much better in the movies Sympathy For Mr Vengeance, The Host,Joint Security Area and Secret Sunshine.",1330646400,,718,4.609375
3830047,3,B001YTTWP0,"How does a marksman, who shoots down an entire Japanese platoon all by himself while on a horse, can't shoot down a single man running away from him? What's more, the marksman doesn't have the common sense to crouch and position himself at the target. Instead, he keeps shooting and missing while running after him in the open desert. There are many such little inconsistencies in this movie that makes it less than special.

The action sequences are too long and too fabricated. It is too much ""the main characters are all Korean and they can all easily kill non-Koreans with ease"" theme.

Contrary to a popular belief, this movie is not really a ripoff of ""The Good, Bad, and Ugly"". The characters and storyline are vastly different enough to warrant that this movie is original in its content.

Lee Byung Hun, who plays the ""bad"" guy, did a wonderful job of acting. He was very convicing in his role.

Cool superflous scene when The Bad hears a centipede moving in his room at night and pins it to the wall with a throwing knife, then shoots the hilt of the knife to drive it deeper into the wood. Yes, he's very muscular, with a ridiculously-sculpted stomach. Diving helmets save lives in desert town shootouts (but what are they doing so far from the ocean anyway?). Blood splatter on camera lens (ewww!). ""I'll prove who's best. Don't die till ten, and be sure to watch."" Rescued kids, then where did they go?

3830049,4,B001YTTWP0,"THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD is director Kim Jee-woon's riff on Sergio Leone's classic THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, and despite the ripoff title it's a film that manages to become its own entity. Kim Jee-woon infuses his film with its own sense of bravura. It's certainly worth a peek if only for its exuberant excesses. The spectacular opening train robbery sequence should get your juices flowing. And this being an homage to Leone's vision of the spaghetti western, note that this isn't at all your conventional martial arts film. It's more of a wild shoot-'em-up, bold pistoleros clearing leather, firearms presiding over nunchuks. There is also a honking big mallet.

The (not much of a) plot revolves around three characters: a cool-as-ice bounty hunter (Woo-sung Jung, the Good), an assassin obsessed with being the best gunhand (Byung-hun Lee, the Bad), and a thieving buffoon (Kang-ho Song, the Weird). The three brace each other across the lawless desert frontier of 1930's Manchuria, in a freewheeling chase after a stolen treasure map. Hindering their progress are a rowdy complement of bandits, gangsters, and the Japanese army. Everyone's furiously scrambling, everyone's so trigger happy. And lurking somewhere in all this is the legendary bogeyman known as the Finger Chopper.

THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD eventually falls victim to its own mad predilections. The characters are uniformly so stylized that it's hard to invest emotionally in any of them. They just don't feel real or believable. It's like watching a Warner Bros. cartoon with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck as wild west gunslingers. Appropriately, the film engages in all manner of cartoony mayhem and violence, and these action sequences are explosive and very fun to watch. The stunts and choreography are pretty dang brilliant. Plot-wise, there is a reveal near the end which caught me off guard, and that was a welcome surprise. THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD should be savored for its frisky Eastern (Korean) take on the American Old West genre, and there are frequent outrageous comic bits, so you'll laugh. It's a nice, lighthearted nod to Sergio Leone. I wished I like the characters more.

And I think it's worth noting that I'm not a big fan of western movies at all, but this movie is one that I would gladly watch over and over because of the three lead actors. I adore all of them and watch movies because of them individually. The only thing I didn't like about this version of the movie was that the ending you'd see in the original version has an additional sequence at the end between The Weird and The Good, but this version cut off that ending. I'm still really happy with this purchase though.",1316822400,,630,4.258333333333334
3830056,5,B001YTTWP0,"I got the Blu-Ray of this movie quickly and at a great Amazon price. I had previously only heard of this movie form previews of it on other Blu-rays. I did a little research before buying it and saw many raves from reviewers. I was not dissapointed!

Almost immediately, the setting and tone of this movie make you feel like you are watching a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. I would call it a KimChi Western, as it seems ot have created a whole new genre!

I started watching the film past midnight, and I intended to watch just the start and catch up with the rest the next day. I was sucked in, and wacthed over half of the film before I reluctantly succumbed to the calling of Morpheus and social obligations. When I watched it again the next day I started from the beginning.

It is set in WWII in the deserts of Manchuria. The three main characters are all portrayed well, but I must say that the Weird and the Bad stole the show from the Good IMHO. I found direction to be superb, some of the action seemed to be a little silly, but only a little.

It is a nice hunk of a movie clocking in at a little over 2 hours. I would have watched hours more!

THERE IS NO ENGLISH DUBBING OF THIS FILM ON THIS BLU-RAY! That is fine by me, as I believe films should be always viewed in their original language, but others might see this as a possible flaw.

Still, I give it 5 stars.",1316131200,4,1378,4.181132075471698

Anyway finally got to see it and instantly loved it. The best part is the big chase scene when ""The Weird"" has everybody after him!

The GB&W is action from the get go and it rarely let's you stop to take a breath. Very little use of CG (or at the least it's non-intrusive except for the credits at the beginning). The actors do most their own stunts according to the bonus footage.",1315094400,,538,4.37
3830059,4,B001YTTWP0,"This piece of Asian action cinema opens with a playfully done CGI sequence.  While it may not be what you're looking for in this movie, it does send the audience a message that the filmmakers were trying to make this movie cool in every way possible.  The result was a visually appealing portal to an amusingly odd movie.  To the credit of all levels of film production, even the opening credits were well done.  You'll see what I mean when you watch it.  A big surprise for me was how beautifully shot the movie was.  A-plus to the cinematography team.

 Don't expect to readily understand who represents the good, the bad and the weird.  I feel that the title is representative of a lost-in-translation concept of its original form that was deliberately riding the coattails of Clint Eastwood's 1966 epic.  That said, I think Chang-yi, the ""finger chopper"", would be ""the bad"".  He is the only one referred to as ""bad"" during the movie that I can remember.  I recall little reference to anyone ""good"" or ""weird"".  Although, Tae-goo is a bumbling fool and a bit weird.  So is Do-won good?  And what about those Genghis Khan-ites?

Much of the flick is composed with a good sense of humor.  Various bandits are all seeking the same treasure map--yes, a treasure map--and they cat-and-mouse and battle it out.  It takes place in the Old West...of China.  Lots of guns, some swords, and a gratuitous battle axe or spear here or there.  But don't expect Hard-Boiled/Equilibrium gun-fu or new wave Hong Kong blade choreography.  It's a bit more slap-dash than that.  If you came for Wachowski brothers-style Matrix combat you will be sorely disappointed.

 So, about halfway through the movie there's a good, longer action sequence.  It's a bit more Hong Kongy in that the entire set, which is quite extensive, serves as a three-dimensional obstacle course rich with props.  The sequence is rather well-done and has both its funny and Asian-action-movie unlikely moments.  Embracing the Jackie-Chan-silliness, look for Tae-goo to ""run zigzag to confuse"" the rival gang's marksmanship.  Or when Tae-goo, who almost single-handedly delivers all humor to the flick, puts on an old-school deep sea diving helmet (which he clearly stole from the set of Men of Honor) which apparently serves as a the only logical target to his foes.

 Contrastingly, Tae-goo's buddy, Man-gil, gets the serious end of the movie.  Most bloodletting seems to be from his abused body and he's the only one to ever seem terrified in the movie.  So, as I jump from tone to tone, we see that there is no real tone for this movie.  The tone shifts conveniently, and not necessarily smoothly, with the scene.

 As mentioned with the title, much is lost in translation when these Asian sensations are released in the United States.  I don't agree with the title choice and I feel that parts of the plot were not properly explained because the translators didn't have an adequate vocabulary, and the pace was erratic.  Despite all this, I managed to find a moral nestled deep within the movie:  Never trust women...or pimps...especially if they sell drugs and call themselves freedom fighters!  These women are called tricks for a reason.  They dose Tae-goo's drink and blow opium smoke in his face.  [Is Tae-goo gonna' have to choke a bitch!?!]  After he is captured and imprisoned by their pimp, he escapes by spearing a guard in the anus and kicks--yes, actually KICKS--it in deeper!  Multiple times!!!  Oh, that's not the only time that happens in the movie.  So we have a moral and a very funny and unique scene to take home from this.

 Now let's throw in a pointlessly huge chase scene, which wasn't as entertaining as it could have been, and the movie is suddenly losing some of my interest.  You don't follow geisha-hookers, drug-dealing pimps, and anal death with some lame chase scene.  It's okay, though.  There was a little plot twist and an entertaining gunfight at the end.  It's no Fight Club brain teaser or Tombstone showdown, but fun nonetheless.

 Amazon reviews average out at 4/5.  As an Asian cinema enthusiast I think I agree, but only in that capacity.  Critical movie buffs will dislike this (I think).  However, if nothing else, it's extremely entertaining.  Even the chase scene, which I thought was bad, was honestly fun--however mostly because of how pointless I found it.  I can also say that I liked this movie more than Sukiyaki Western Django (but I also found that to be Takashi Miike's worst movie).  I hope that Django doesn't scare anyone away from watching The Good, the Bad, the Weird or the much newer The Warrior's Way.  Many Amazon reviewers will lead you astray with ""best ever"" statements for various aspects of the movie.  Don't get me wrong, see the movie.  But don't expect the best action scenes, best gunfights, best stunts, or best character interactions.  Instead expect a lot of good and entertaining.  That way you'll be disappointed by less and, perhaps, pleasantly surprised by more.

 For the superfans out there Kang Ho-Song, the ""weird"", was the star of The Thirst, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, and The Host (to name the majors).  By the way, SEE ALL OF THESE in the intentionally listed order!!!!!  I think this guy is great.  Byung-Hun Lee, ""the bad"", was Storm Shadow for those of you who suffered through the recent G. I. Joe movie.  Expect greatness from him in the future.  Ji-Woon Kim, the director, is also someone to follow.",1309564800,,5454,4.820540540540541
3830060,4,B001YTTWP0,"The Good, the Bad, the Weird is action packed and full of 'AH HA' moments as it takes the American Western and transplants it into Central Asia.  Although the movie lifts a lot from its namesake the Good/Bad/Ugly, i.e, the three main characters mimic their counterparts Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, and Lee Van Cleef, the plot has enough unique twists and turns and incredible action and stunt work to make this movie stand out on its own. Any movie which has a battle including the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, a bounty hunter, and a hitman and his gang all chasing the same thief is worth checking out!

3830061,3,B001YTTWP0,"I love this film. I am admittedly a junkie for Korean cinema, and this is one of the better films to come from that country in the past few years. A really exciting, action-filled ""eastern"" that takes place in the early 20th century in Manchuria. There are some flat-out great gun fights and chases throughout the entire film. Actually, the movie is like one giant chase with ample set pieces. The camera work and pacing is excellent and the performances are quite memorable. The tone is comically light, but never cartoonish. If you consider yourself a fan of action cinema, this is a must-watch.

BUT, the blu-ray is 1080i!! Most of the time when Asian films get a 1080i transfer, it's because that's the only one available and the studio releasing the film is lazy/cheap. Like with some of the HK/Chinese blus. What that means practically is that there was pixellating in the image when the camera panned slowly. Also, in wide shots with lots of little detail, the image gets kinda blocky. This is a particularly unforgivable offense as there is another, apparently great 1080p transfer available in other markets. Very lame IFC. Sorry.",1302652800,30,1139,4.841025641025641

3830064,4,B001YTTWP0,"The Good, the Bad, and the Weird doesn't quite live up to its namesake, but it comes very close. It captures the feeling of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly without ever stepping on its toes, so don't go into it expecting a true remake. That isn't what this movie is, and that is a good thing. Some films never need to be remade. I am 29, and I can say without any hesitation that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was one of the greatest films of all time. It truly stood the test of time, and these folks clearly agreed.

  This is not a martial arts movie, and while many characters obviously know martial arts, that is not how they tend to settle their grievances. This is a western, and they settle disputes with their guns. The characters (and this is not limited to the three main characters) are all very entertaining. They all have their reasons, and while you won't always agree with them, you understand where they are coming from. The fact that this is a Korean movie only shows in its cast, so you don't need to know anything about their culture to `get' it. The film makers were not trying to cash in on a playful name, they clearly love the genre and it shows.

  This was a very fun movie, and despite its length, it didn't drag on or overstay its welcome. I was actually shocked when it ended, because it didn't seem like over 2 hours had gone by. What it comes down to is this: If you don't mind subtitles and are thinking of buying The Good, the Bad and the Weird, then you probably should.",1300320000,,1505,4.2264808362369335

The production values are pretty good and the characters are interesting. It involves a treasure map and is set in the period of the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. Apparently, there were a lot of expatriate Koreans in Manchuria at that time. Anyhow, watch and enjoy this shoot-em-up. Oh yeah, there are the English subtitles to read.

Woon also does use the mainstream and idea of the dollars trilogy, yet still adding utmost originality to this film, set in the 1930's. The three Korean actors are based on the original G.B.& U. characters, Blonde, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. This film released in 2008 and now released 2010 on video, rolls with the punches, loaded with non-stop action, forget about a dull moment, when bullets aren't flying, some comedy is added especially with the Tuco character. Another surprise is the transfer and audio of this dvd, absolutely stunning, shot in China, adding to the pictorial visionary and cinematography - being a hardcore spaghetti western collector, and really was skeptical about this film, my thoughts changed after watching, The Good, The Bad, The Weird, seeing is believing.

Not super important for me, but when i try and get my friends and family together to watch, i get a lot of eyes rolling when they hear they have to read subtitles.

3830071,3,B001YTTWP0,The title of this movie should've been: For A Few Fingers More. The movie was about a thief and treasure map that nobody could read nor believe that it was real! It had action but the movie tried too hard to make people laugh. It was ok not great just ok. Rent before you buy. It was a western and had plenty of action but the main characters clearly were borrowing their roles from other actors and that's just wrong. In any western be authentic or get out of town! I mean there was a greedy hitman who despite enjoyed killing anyone his real purpose was trying to find the guy that chopped off his finger during a fight! The bounty hunter was in it for the money and prey whoever or wherever it came from and the thief was agreedy idiot who was in it from the begining for the money! You can find this type of movie anywhere and it would be better this piece of nothing! Still rent it before you buy it!,1289001600,2,905,4.1477272727272725
3830072,5,B001YTTWP0,"This movie has everything! From the very first scene (amazing) to the very last (did NOT see that coming) I was enthralled. A South Korean film set in 1940's Manchuria, this film is the funniest action-packed western you'll ever hope to see. I watched it with my 8 year old son, re-rented it 2 days later at his urging and ordered it from Amazon the next day to save rental fees. With the unexpected soundtrack (I don't want to ruin it for you) play this movie loud. I can't decide if this or Inception was the best movie I've seen all year. The difference is I could watch this movie ten times and not tire of it. What are you waiting for? Click on ""Add to Cart""!!",1288396800,15,665,4.244094488188976
3830073,5,B001YTTWP0,"This is basically a Korean rework of the Italian western ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". Its set in the ""wild east"" of the 1930s with Japanese, Koreans and assorted others going after hidden treasure. The film had a far larger budget than the old Italian westerns and it shows. But it not pure homiage and has a style all its own. The pacing is excellent. The fight scenes are original as are the settings. The film also has a sense of humor.

Its the most entertaining action film I've seen in a long while. The setting was a very imaginative choice as well.",1288051200,,561,4.3428571428571425
3830074,4,B001YTTWP0,"Now if I said this movie was about 3 Koreans (one bad, one good and one weird) in China during the Japanese occupation as they hunt for ancient treasure in Manchuria and it's filmed as a western - you might be saying to yourself, ""I think I'll give this one a pass,""  but give it a try.  It works in a magical way as you sit back and watch an amazing story fly by.

We learn at the beginning that there is an ancient treasure map that a Crime Lord intends to sell and then steal back.  He sends the top assassin (the Bad) to handle this job.  Flash to a train chugging along as a spaghetti western score plays.  The three main characters run across each other as they try to reach their different objectives on the train.  Bad is looking to steal back the treasure map, Good is a bounty hunter and there to catch Bad, and Weird is just looking for anything that can be converted to easy cash.  Weird ends up with the map but has no idea what it is at first.  He soon learns the truth and so begins the mad dash to Manchuria to find the hidden treasure.  Weird is determined and not the Black Market Gang, the Tribesmen, Bad and his rag tag bunch of criminals or even a troop of Japanese soldiers is going to stop him.

Not everybody is what they seem just like this movie. It is a good, bad and weird mix of western, action, mystery and comedy.  Although the movie slipped in spots, it kept me glued to the screen throughout.  It was fun watching and I would highly recommend this entertaining film as long as subtitles don't bother you.",1287878400,,1537,4.204778156996587

3830076,4,B001YTTWP0,"I have been watching a lot of foreign films and in terms of content, storytelling, acting and the overall product I find that the Korean films are the best. I have watched Thirst, The Host, and Memories of Murder this year and they were superb in all aspects of storytelling. The Good, Bad and the Weird movie can also be considered an addition to the list.
This is a tribute to the movie Good, Bad and Ugly by Sergio Leone. While this a loose translation and the settings have changed, essentially this movie at heart is still a western even though the location has changed to 1930's Manchuria. Three people, the good, bad and the weird are on the lookout of a treasure map. The movie follows them on their individual trail, their skirmishes with each other and with the Japanese Army who are also on the lookout for this map. Needless to say, the action scenes are spectacular. The desert and the barren landscapes have been shot beautifully. The characters are well developed and the movie itself is a treat to watch. I watched the Korean version which has an ending which is more upbeat than the American version. I loved it. Four stars 9/27/10",1285977600,,1148,4.577669902912621
3830077,3,B001YTTWP0,"It's a comedy Western movie in  Korean style. Some scenes are hilarious scenes. The action scenes are exciting and non-stop with very little use of CGI. There is no depth in the plot and the characters. It's also completely nonsense but I don't mind. It's just a comedy! The acting is good enough to keep me watching for 2 hours. The twist ending is entertaining.

In short, it's worth watching once.",1284768000,2,400,4.619718309859155
3830078,4,B001YTTWP0,"First, I DID like this movie. It was entertaining, funny, full of action, well made, etc. It came with plenty of special features such as a behind the scenes, 2 part making-of featurettes, interviews and more. I especially enjoyed in the behind the scenes where they show how the whole crew truly looks out for one another when a staff member riding next to a train, falls and suffers some minor injuries. Also, the weather (Tornado, rainbows, etc) it seemed like the cast took the time to make use of, and enjoy what they had to use ""on the fly"". This is something we Americans do not usually show in our movies.
The only bad thing is, it is ONLY in Korean. There is no english soundtrack. You are stuck watching it in Korean language with english subtitles and Korean language tends to be fast spoken so the subtitles are gone too fast for some people. Although I made it through ok, I definately saw the difference from a regular subtitled movie that some people may not be happy with.
It is worth the money and I give it 4 stars.",1284508800,,1033,4.4136125654450264

3830080,4,B001YTTWP0,"I saw the trailers for this and it looked cool so I gave it a shot. Boy, this is one wild ride. It's set in China in, I believe, the 30s but it's loaded with anachronisms so there is a bit of a head spin going on there.

The plot revolves around a map that may be a treasure map but may hold information key to getting Korea out from under the thumb of the Chinese. The map falls into the hands of a vest pocket crook who tries to make his way to the noted location while dodging everyone else who is looking for it.

This is a fun, cool movie with lots going on. The plot is involved. The colors are many and the action is outstanding. You would be hard pressed to find action scenes choreographed and directed as well as the ones here. You have some really good characters dressed in some really cool outfits. This is like sitting down at a feast where the food just keeps coming.

On the ""could have been better"" side of things is the introduction of the characters. As this is an obvious homage to Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly you do need to compare the two. In Leone's epic the first leg of the movie is spent introducing you to the the three main dudes. and he does a great job of it. The Clint Eastwoodish character in this movie almost falls into a scene. You're not certain right away who he is or why he's there. Likewise with the Korean ""ugly/weird"" character: He arrives after the plot for the double cross on the map has already been set up. He sort of comes in on the fly. The one character who they take some time with in the beginning is the ""bad"" guy but even he is more of a sketch. To be fair, you do get to know them as the movie goes on but I could have used better character set-up. Also, In Leone's film the plot is extremely well written. The story builds very specifically and logically. Here, things aren't as tight. I felt like I was running from here to there for no real reason.

That being said, this is still a heck of a movie and well worth the time spent for anyone who really enjoys film.",1282521600,,2031,4.10831234256927
3830081,5,B001YTTWP0,Awesome film...only vaguely like its namesake but full of action and humor.  The cinematography is wonderful and the action sequences well paced.  My only gripe would be that the sun was shining brightly during the heavy rain sequence at the Ghost Market but that is minor.  An outstanding film and I strongly recommend it for all fans of Westerns.,1282435200,,348,4.864406779661017

3830083,4,B001YTTWP0,"Sergio Leone on a bender in 1930s Manchuria.

Almost non-stop action, most of it tongue in cheek but nicely choreographed, lots of color and pizazz, and above all an endearing sense of absurdity make this a pleasure to watch. Director Ji-Woon knows the genre well and delights in subverting it without mercy; the guy in the diving helmet was one of my favorites. Any movie that takes itself this unseriously yet also delivers thrills and humor is a success by any measure; that it's Korean and does Hollywood one better makes it all the more fun.

Some of the violence is a little overdone, but it's all rather comic-bookish anyhow. The real highlight for me were the many incredibly long, tight tracking shots, full of wild angles and unexpected twists and turns of the camera. Shots like that take great care and preparation and for so many of them to work so well is no mean feat (the extras docs show just how wild some of these set-ups were). To have it all be this wacky and light-hearted yet also so breakneck is a real achievement. Plus the acting is both gleefully hammy and surprisingly well done: I never once thought, ""What a crappy take."" Somehow it all just fits, once again in the spirit of the best spaghetti westerns.

It does go on a little longer than it might have, with too much time spent pontificatin' to no real end, but that and the occasional gratuitously graphic violence were my only qualms. I loved that there was no English-language dubbing (which is so often so bad), just the original Korean and good subtitles full of flavor and colloquial feel. This is how it should be done. All in all, it's an over the top shoot-em-up and delivers on that promise in spades, diamonds and treasure maps.

The blu-ray is very nicely done, not a flawless transfer but very good, and there are a bunch of solid extras, including various interviews and making-ofs; it's a nice package and will no doubt contribute to this film's inevitable cult status. There've been a few other Asian westerns but this one is in a league of its own, and the quality of the image along with the color and the humor make it a real treat to watch. And it's almost all shot outdoors in natural light, often in gloriously huge mountainous wilderness, so it feels very real even with all its goofiness, and the final motorcycle/horse/jeep battle is a true classic.

[A note to any surfers out there: when you see the sea in the distance at 1:18:02, check out those insane, endless tubes peeling off in a perfect set. Surf Manchuria!]

If you like westerns, Asian cinema, great cinematography, nutty genre humor, or/and just a good old-fashioned fun movie, Good Bad Weird is for you.",1282089600,17,2675,4.632911392405063
3830084,4,B001YTTWP0,"""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" is an entry into the genera of Asian Westerns, and is probably the best of the limited array already available. Essentially, ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" (the film is named after the three main characters) is a chase movie from start to finish, and as such has a very limited storyline.  Set in the Manchuria in the 1930's, during the Japanese occupation, The Weird (Song Kang-ho of JSA, Memories of Murder, The Host) robs a train (in a very nifty opening sequence) and comes across a treasure map in the hands of the Japanese.  The Bad (Lee Byung-hun of JSA, A Bittersweet Life) is an assassin tasked with stealing the map, and after initially being foiled by The Weird, begins to pursue The Weird.  The Good (Jung Woo-sung of Musa) is a bounty hunter who is also after the map, and then, like The Bad, pursues The Weird.  The Good captures the Weird, The Bad then tracks the pair of them, the ""Ghost gang"" is also after the map, and then the Japanese get involved with trying to retrieve the map.  It all culminates in a lengthy action packed finale in the Manchurian desert.

A Korean production, ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" is a truly impressive effort, reputed to be Korea's most expensive film production to date and it shows.  There are some great set pieces - there is a bustling ""Ghost Town"", reminiscent of a wild west frontier town, and of course the backdrop for much of the film is the desert.  The overall sets and costumes are great, and have very real lived in quality to them.  The camera work is fantastic - there are some jaw dropping angles and long, sweeping shots galore.  The plentiful action sequences are well choreographed and shot.  I really enjoyed the characterisation of The Bad - a suave and debonair Lee has a field day with this role, and steals every scene he is in.  Song reproduces his bumbling and slightly dense everyday man role from ""The Host"", and thus is playing somewhat to type.  Nonetheless, both of these characters add humour to the film.  Jung makes a good fist of his role and probably has more intensive stunt sequences than the other two (apparently he broke his arm during filming) but is still overshadowed by the other leads.

There are some minor niggles - the film is probably 15 minutes too long, and some action sequences could have been trimmed down without sacrificing the story (there isn't much to it after all!).  There are also a few of those long meaningful shots of character's faces as they contemplate their fate/options/events... which I have noticed that many Korean directors indulge themselves in.  The lack of a substantive plot didn't bother me - after all it is clearly an action film, and not intended to be fine art.

All in all, ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" does do credit to Korean film.  Because of its western angle, ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" should have broader appeal than just Asian film aficionados.  It is just rollicking good (brainless) fun.

Note: There is an International Version (which is the subject of this review) and a Korean version of The Good, the Bad, the Weird.  There are extra scenes in the Korea version, the most significant of which relate to the Korean resistance backstory - the absence of these scenes from the International Version doesn't detract from the overall story.  There is also an extended ending sequence.  Apparently, there is a three disc DVD release available in Korea which has both versions of the film.",1281744000,3,3471,4.661740558292283
3830085,5,B001YTTWP0,"Asian westerns are a rare breed of film. As of this writing, I'm only aware of three: ""Tears of the Black Tiger"" (2000, Thailand), ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" (2007, Japan), and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Weird"" (2008, South Korea). The Thai entry was pretty good, with excellent use of color and some decent humor. The Japanese entry (directed by the wildly popular Takashi Miike) was a piece of trash that had horrible scriptwriting, lame action scenes on the whole, and a penchant for provoking maximum irritation on the part of the viewer.

Enter South Korean director Ji-woon Kim, the mastermind behind the single greatest film ever made - ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (2003) - and the man who gave us other quality films such as ""A Bittersweet Life"" (2005), ""Memories"" (2002), and the very funny ""Quiet Family"" (1998) and ""Foul King"" (2000). While ""A Bittersweet Life"" demonstrated Kim's talent for directing action, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Weird"" (""GBW"") is an entirely different beast due to the elaborate setups of epic shootouts involving dozens upon dozens of actors. This is not an easy step to take, but Kim pulled it off in masterful fashion.

Unlike Miike's crapfest - which only had one decent clash near the end - GBW is packed with the best set of wild west style shootouts of any film I've ever seen. There are a number of reasons for this, but the big one is the genius of Kim's camera-work and directing skill. I kid you not, the lengthy tracking shots are no less than sheer brilliance. The camera will begin with one particular character/scenario only to then move in unique ways with zoom ins, zoom outs, aerial maneuvers, and high speed helicopter/crane shots to gradually reveal the action of a different character/scenario - thus linking the events together without the need for editing. If nothing else, Kim should be applauded for his camera-work, because with GBW he has convincingly ascended to a level that's equal to guys like Dario Argento and Andrei Tarkovsky. Yeah, it's that damn SPECTACULAR.

Byung-hun Lee (from ""A Bittersweet Life"") and Woo-sung Jung (from ""Musa: The Warrior"") do well with their characters, but it's Kang-ho Song who steals the show. I know that some will complain that Kang-ho uses his trademark dim-witted awkwardness a bit too much, but he does it so well that I don't mind seeing it so long as it's used in different ways. Fortunately, he has some classic scenes in GBW - a few of which are laugh-out-loud hilarious.

Those expecting the dramatic weight that made ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" (1966) so awesome will be sorely disappointed. This is an all out action film at its core, and only uses a few ideas from Sergio Leone's classic as a springboard for non-stop popcorn entertainment. The films are so different that they are not even remotely comparable. That does not mean, however, that GBW dips to the pathetic levels of some Hollywood epics. At no point during this film did I gather the impression that Kim was pandering to create a hollow, empty product because the outcome has so much energy and spirit. (It was only after reading online comments that drew the comparison.) Even more convincing is that GBW is 99% CGI free, which is anti-Hollywood to the extreme. If you want to see an Asian film industry that sacrifices quality in an attempt to ape Hollywood, look no further than recent Chinese historical epics like ""The Warlords"" (2007) and ""Red Cliff"" (2008). Now THOSE are some essentially worthless fluff pieces - one of which was directed by a now-worthless director (John Woo) who has used the same two clichs for the past 20 years. GBW, on the other hand, is a resounding success - further solidifying Ji-woon Kim's status as one of the best directors alive today.

Hollywood cinema is really becoming superfluous in the grand scheme of things. You can basically find every kind of film in non-American countries, and the fact that they're surpassing their American counterparts in terms of sheer entertainment value is a nasty indictment on the cinema of the west. Times are changing - and American movie-making will crumble from within as the mega studios keep churning out garbage for a quick buck. I say, good riddance.",1279238400,11,4213,4.829639889196676
3830086,4,B001YTTWP0,"The movie is not much more than I stated in the title of my review, yet it is a non-stop, action-packed roller-coaster ride through Manchuria during the 1930`s with 3 principal characters- the Good, The Bad, and the Weird, tho the character lines get fuzzy more often than once. It`s little more than a chase film over a map for buried treasure ala Indiana Jones, yet the director, Kim Ji-Hoon ('A Tale of Two Sisters', probably the most beautiful horror film I`ve ever seen, 'A Bittersweet Life', a terrific revenge flick as only Asians can produce) and lead actor Kang-ho Song ('Thirst', 'Memories Of Murder', 'Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance', 'R-Point', 'Spider Forest', 'The Host', 'JSA', etc.) do such remarkable jobs , along with a stellar cast of eccentric starring and peripheral characters, that the movie suceeds on many levels at once. It`s a Western-Action-Comedy-Revenge Hybrid that has little down-time, even though it clocks in at 2 1/4 hours. I typically don`t enjoy action movies, tho I`ve developed a weakness for Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns and several Asian exceptions, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one, the action sequences would make John Woo or Takashi Miike envious. It`s Epic proportions outstrip 'Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan', and I`m a big fan of Tadanobu Asano`s films. This one`s got it all, for a (family) movie of its type (and it has its flaws,`natch, don`t get me wrong) - if you even remotely liked Miike`s 'Sukiyaki Western Django', try this one on for size, I considered it an infinitely more enjoyable film.",1276387200,2,1550,4.988416988416988
3830087,4,B001YTTWP0,"Small wonder that after director Kim Jee-Woon's magnificent ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" and the terrific ""A Bittersweet Life"" that his next film would be so eagerly anticipated. ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird"" has won numerous awards in Asia, achieved box-office acclaim in South Korea and has been selected for the Cannes film festival. I've said before that an Asian western isn't exactly an original concept; there was a video game called ""Western Samurai"", the Hong Kong produced ""Peace Hotel"" and most recently, Takashi Mike's ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" from Japan. Well, it seems like South Korea won't be left behind and with Kim Jee-Woon at the helm, expectations are rather high and the man doesn't disappoint.

A two-bit bumbling crook named Tae-Goo ""The Weird"" (Song Kang-Ho, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) robs a train only to unintentionally make off with a Quing Dynasty treasure map. Everyone wants this map; the Japanese army, the Korean independence group as well as a lot of shady characters. On Tae-goo's tail is a relentless killer named Park Chang-Yi ""The Bad"" (Lee Byung-Hyun, A Bittersweet Life) who is also after the map and has a seemingly personal reason as to why he wants Tae-Goo's head on a plate. In hot pursuit for both of them is a bounty hunter named Park Do-Won (Jung Woo-Sung, The Restless) who can do nicely with the bounty for Chang-Yi's capture or the treasure itself. Now, these three men are on a collision course--who would win out in the end?

Kim Jee-Woon's ""The Good the Bad the Weird"" is an extremely well-made film and is a highly entertaining genre-busting affair. This chaotic period similar to the wild west in America, a Machuria-set ""kimchi"" western (as opposed to ""sukiyaki"") is a melting pot of all things awesome about westerns and looks like a homage to Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"". There's a train heist, lots of shoot-outs in a small town and cool characters. You'll see bits and pieces of ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" (so obvious with the film's title), ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and even Miike's ""Sukiyaki Western Django"". The film has a very large budget and it shows, the film is exquisitely shot and the superb style and camerawork reminded me of Ryuhei Kitamura (Azumi). Director Kim definitely knows his stuff in style and with the film's intriguing concept, Asian and Korean cinema fans have reason to see this film, and it is definitely something that a ""solid"" Asian film fan just can't miss.

The film's set designs and architecture maintain some of that ""dynasty-era"" Korean period but it does have a strong touch of the old west. It has some rather creative touches; there is some swordplay, knives used with brutality, there's a big guy with a huge hammer, a ""sleeping Buddha"" under construction, rifles with telescopes, motorcycles and jeeps, saloons and more--all these contribute to the film's ""mixing of genres"" style. Director Kim also seems to be having a lot of fun with the film, as he never forgets his touches of humor to help the film's pace and his stunning camerawork which proves to be the film`s showstopper. Explosions and gunfire are aplenty; highlights include a very cool town gunfight and a very long chase sequence with the ensembled cast supported by dozens of extras.  I've read that Kim actually had cameramen hanging on wires to shoot the desert scenes--Kim Jee-Woon's talent shines through.

The action scenes are very exciting and exquisitely executed. It looks like director Kim took some pointers from Ryuhei Kitamura because they are just so full of ""coolness"" that can make action scribe John Woo a little jealous. Kim also avoids the use of CGI in the action and depends mostly on elaborate stunts and old-fashioned camera trickey; there is minimal use of CGI enhanced effects but only in the film's set designs. Ok, so some scenes required a large suspension of disbelief, I rather found Jung Woo-Sung's Do-Won's skills with a gun a little too over-the-top especially when he engages a large number of the Japanese army. He never even gets grazed by a bullet so either Do-Won is unbelievably good or these guys just supremely suck. But hey, this is a minor complaint, after all I don't think this film was meant to be taken seriously and more of a homage film. Hey, please take note that Kim doesn't hold back with the blood--and the way he executes it kept the film from having too much of that ""comic bookish"" feel. There is also a legend of a certain ""Finger chopper"" that gives some surprises and I felt that the screenplay played its cards well.

Song Kang-Ho's Tae-Goo arguably steals the show and proves to be the film's most interesting character--the actor also proves as to why he is one of South Korea's most sought after performers. The man can act in almost any film I've seen that further cements his reputation in versatility. Lee Byung Hyun does have the most intense presence onscreen, his character along with Song Kang-Ho's Tae-goo are the kind of characters that can elevate the film into ""cult status"". Jung Woo-Sung's ""the Good"" character feels a little too cool and lacks precision, but the actor does do the best with what he has. Still, the three popular actors mesh very well and has dynamic chemistry. Oh, the women are also great-looking and serves to titillate the male audience.

""The Good, The Bad, The Weird"" is a very polished film that lived up to my expectations. The film's plot isn't too deep, but the film's ""wow"" factor is just so incredibly impressive that I can look pass the very simple plot which makes it essentially a chase film. It is a solid film, that exudes popcorn entertainment but its characters do carry much of the film's weight. It may be little too pre-occupied in becoming captivated with itself but its small flaws aren't really worth to nitpick. The film is an action-packed affair that action junkies will never become bored--as for the rest, they can find something else to like in the film--its characters, style and performers will definitely impress. I'm happy to say that Kim Jee-Woon's film lived up to the hype.

Highly Recommended! [4 - Stars]

There are two versions of the film. The International version (the one presented in Cannes) is arguably the better paced, leaner film that maintains a touch of mystery at the end. The Korean 130 minute cut has more development to Tae-Goo's character and an extended climax that answers a lot of questions. The official U.S. version is expected to have the original 130 minute version.",1276214400,59,6500,4.853922452660054
3830088,4,B001YTTWP0,"Westerns aren't what they used to be. Just about any fan of the genre will agree with that statement, but they do still get it right every once in awhile. What are some of the better westerns since the early '90s? Tombstone and Unforgiven are probably on that list somewhere. It's more than likely that the 3:10 to Yuma remake from 2007 and Appaloosa from 2008 are two of the better westerns from recent years. It's safe to say that The Good, The Bad, The Weird is the best Korean western to date, but it's not like it has much competition. The only other film that comes close is Sukiyaki Western Django by Japanese director Takashi Miike. The film has Miike's fingerprints all over it, but the fact that it was shot in English hurt it more than anything else. The Good, The Bad, The Weird may not have much competition, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great film. It just makes it that much easier to have the film be in a class all on its own.

The highlight of the film is every shootout the characters find themselves in. The choreography is done so well that you almost feel like you're a part of the action taking shelter behind a wall to reload or taking that last deep breath before making a run for it. The film is also an incredible mix of action and comedy. Some of the comedy included in Korean films, or any foreign film for that matter, either goes over people's heads when it's shown in other countries or just isn't funny at all. That's not the case here. The comedy was definitely at least chuckle-worthy all the way through the film. Nearly everything Yoon Tae-goo does is hilarious in some form or another. Most westerns seem to have the legitimate bad ass featured either as the main character or a strong supporting character. To name a few examples, 3:10 to Yuma (2007) had Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) and The Dollars Trilogy had the man with no name. The Good, The Bad, The Weird has three. Do-won, Chang-yi, and Tae-goo are all intriguing in their own right. Do-won is an amazing shot, rarely misses, and just wants to do what's right (for the right price, of course), Chang-yi can't stand being second best to anyone, and then there's Tae-goo. Sure, he may be a simple train thief with a bounty on his head that's equivalent to a used piano, but there's more to his character than the goofy dimwit he portrays himself as.

While the film is incredible, some will find that the storyline is practically wafer thin. The storyline is basically, ""somebody else has a map we want, so let's take it,"" in a nutshell. It wasn't really an issue for me and I'm usually one of the first people to point out that a film has a weak story. It gets the job done here or everything else is done so well that it doesn't matter that the story may or may not be weak in the end. The wondering of what the map is and why everyone in Manchuria wants it was very reminiscent of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, which is meant purely as a compliment.

The Good, The Bad, The Weird is a fantastic blend of absorbing action sequences, beautiful cinematography, strong performances, and a dash of lighthearted comedy. It's safe to say that I'm not the biggest western genre fan around, but it's films like this that make me want to dive head first into the genre and not look back.",1268524800,4,3300,4.4243421052631575
3830089,2,B001YTTWP0,"I recently purchased this DVD. Bad news: Bad, blurry transfer. Clearly somebody downloaded a low-res, compressed version, pressed it on disk and distributed it to vendors who don't bother to check out their foreign titles (hello Amazon!). Elsewhere in the world, this outstanding film is available on blu-ray. *Sigh*",1262044800,2,316,5.469387755102041
3830090,3,B001YTTWP0,"I had very high expectations for this film and was a little disappointed. Some sequences were to long and there was nothing original or creative in the action or story. It's still a decent flick and entertaining, just nothing special. It's without saying it's no where near as good as Sergio Leone's masterpieces but most films aren't and this film wasn't trying to be. It's a dumb action movie that's very well made. It just seems that the director was writing the script as he was filming it. Another recent asian western is 'Sukiyaki Western Django' and I found it to be much more enjoyable than this.",1260144000,,604,4.654205607476635

8348150,5,B001YTTWP0,"If you don't count Spaghetti Westerns, this is definitely my favorite foreign Western.  It takes place during the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in the 1930's, right before the start of WWII.  Despite the title, it is NOT a ripoff of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  The plots are only slightly similar, as there is a good guy, a bad guy, and a guy who is somewhere in between, and they're all looking for treasure.

Great action sequences, great cinematography, and a great cast.  Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.  The actor who plays the ""bad"" guy is very recognizable, as he shows up in a lot of American movies these days.  A serious throwback to the Hollywood days of old; there are plenty of cool stunts and very real explosions, instead of it being all CG like most American movies today.  There is limited use of CGI, such as the bird of prey at the beginning of the movie, which is really the only thing that bothered me.  The big chase sequence toward the end of the movie is reminiscent of the final chase in The Road Warrior.  Rival gangs, the main characters and the Japanese military all get in the mix.

Overall I enjoyed this movie so much that I have watched it several times.  I had it on DVD when it was first released and I recently bought the Bluray.  I have seen this movie show up on more than one ""Greatest 50 Westerns"" lists.  Don't miss this movie if you enjoy Westerns!  I'm not sure if there is an English dub; I've only watched with subtitles.",1525651200,,1475,4.431226765799257
8348151,5,B001YTTWP0,"Purchased it after Netflix took it off. That's how good it is. Fast slick action. Gun fight scenes and stunts are top notch. Music hot and fun. Plot was well connected with an ending that surprised me. Scenery, costumes, props(check out authenticity of train car interiors)well implemented. Choreography is great. Horses, motorcycle, jeeps all racing like crazy across the plain, sometimes in opposite directions. The bounty hunter twirling shotguns and rifles is my favorite! Loved it. American studios just don't do period movies/dramas as well as Asia and Turkey.",1522195200,,566,5.370786516853933
8348152,5,B001YTTWP0,"Perhaps one of my favorite movies. Incredible non-stop action (and violence) in an interesting historical setting. An engaging plot with great cinematography & effects, some CG, but still good. Interesting characters and a nice twist at the end.",1520380800,,245,5.473684210526316

8348158,5,B001YTTWP0,"I do not profess to be any kind of movie critic however in my humble opinion this is a wonderful film. I saw the title and had to watch. This movie is not some kind of remake of ""The good the bad and the ugly"". This film stands on its own. Viewers may find some similarity to the great Sergio Leone film, but I myself consider any similarities to be few.
In this film we do find the story of 3 engaging characters which fate has brought together. I did find myself wanting to know more about the past of the main characters, however you need not know more than what is revealed. There is an abundance of action scenes that are absolutely marvellous. The cinematography was top shelf all the way. One of the best uses of a train in a movie. The film is fairly fast paced with little time to catch your breath once things get going, which it should be when you are in a race to find treasure before someone else.
If you like action movies, westerns, or Quentin Tarantino films then you simply must watch this one.
The only negative thing I have to say is that I could not watch it in a theater on the big screen. This film is big enough to make full use of the largest screen you can see it on.
My humble opinion, thanks for reading.",1475280000,,1231,4.154811715481172
