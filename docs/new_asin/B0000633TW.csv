1687612,5,B0000633TW,"Having lived through the hype of Episode 1 in Los Angeles, as well as having my life impacted by the Star Wars phenomenon, this film was both insightful and extremely funny. And it also makes you realize you aren't half the Star Wars geek you think you are. If you even remotely like Star Wars, you will love this movie.",1021334400,2,320,4.35
1687613,5,B0000633TW,"Expect the unexpected with this one, people. I saw this at a screening in LA and was taken by how SERIOUS these people were. And as we all know, SERIOUS weirdos is SERIOUSLY FUNNY. Trekkies are too easy. A beat-scratching Boba Fett mobile DJ figure, now that's the good stuff. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1021334400,,316,5.215686274509804
1687614,5,B0000633TW,This is a hilarious film!!  I saw it at the Santa Babara Film Festival and couldn't beleive how freaky Star Wars nuts can be.  These people are serious about their knowledge of the force and what it can do.  Very entertaining.,1021334400,,226,4.463414634146342
1687615,4,B0000633TW,"If you've ever wondered why there are so many Star Wars [fans] out there, and either laughed with or at them, you'll dig this movie.  You meet  those people throughout the country who actually waited a month on line to get tickets for the first showing of the SW prequel a few years back.  Some of them are in costume, some of them perform SW related music, some of them end up not even liking the movie.  It's extremely entertaining and actually ends up being kind of moving because you learn something pretty meaningful about the human condition and have more compassion for those people who, by no fault of their own, grew up with some pretty basic human needs going unmet.  Very quick pace, fun tone, and engaging throughout.",1021334400,,729,4.576923076923077
1687616,5,B0000633TW,"I caught this one at Slamdance...pretty [darn] funny. Yeah I remember that bit with the grumpy driver. I was waiting for the Tie-Fighter Pilot to admit to faking that lisp, but...hmmm. That was some priceless moment. My friend complained that the movie seemed a bit mean-spirited sometimes but I thought it should have been more condemning...but I guess that would be proselytizing when a good doc shows things for how they really are, and this one certainly did that. I loved the banter between the filmakers and the supposed ""professional"" newscaster. That guy was a real cheeseball. I recommend! Hope they have commentary on this DVD... Either way I'll buy it.",1021248000,,663,4.981981981981982
1687617,4,B0000633TW,This is a pretty funny movie.  Definitely the funniest documentary I've seen.  I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie.  You gotta see it - it's fun to laugh at star wars geeks.,1020816000,,183,4.484848484848484
1687618,5,B0000633TW,"This film is a must for any collector of Star Wars-related products or media.  It offers an excellent potrayal of the fans that have made the whole ""Star Wars""-thing an integral component of American culture.  Also there are several candid and hilarious interviews with various clebrities about the Star Wars phenomenon.  Don't miss the Joe Pesci on the golf course clip.",1020729600,,371,5.049180327868853
1687619,5,B0000633TW,"A truly inspired documentary that both embraces and laughs at the very phenomenon it dissects. ""A Galaxy Far Far Away"" broke attendance records when it opened the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. This film more than portrays the inner workings of the Star Wars fan but more importantly seeks to answer why the phenomenon has caught on the way it has.
Sure there are people in the film to make you groan, but there are others who you deeply empathize with. More than just a film meant to capatilize on the fandom it portrays, it seeks something deeper and yet remains thoroughly entertaining and humorous as well.
Loaded with celebrity cameos, though not all of them with sound (as seen in the film's coda), ""A Galaxy Far, Far Away"" is meant not only for any fan of ""Star Wars"" but also any fan of life and what makes our society what it is.
The film is worth viewing for the supergenius himslef, who parades around as Boba Fett playing remixed Star Wars inspired dance songs and for a truly brilliant scene comparing the power of need: fans pushing and shoving for the newly released Star Wars action figure versus citizens of Kosovo pushing and shoving for a single piece of bread.",1020643200,6,1193,4.605633802816901
1687620,5,B0000633TW,"I saw this movie in Los Angeles when it was in release this year.  I thought the personal style of the documentary was right for the type of subject it covers.  This is not a film about death row inmates, so the filmmakers were wise not to take them selves too seriously.  However, they do take their subjects seriously.  These people substitute Star Wars for the things their generation have been deprived of.  They do it with humor of course, but still, they do it.
It's a refreshingly different doc about sub cultures.  It doesn't mock it's subjects.  Star Wars has had an enormous impact not just on 'geeks' but on mainstream culture as well.  This film caters to the regular Joe who may not ever camp out on line for anything, but is curious about those who do and why.
There are gritty DIY sequences, like when they interview an airport shuttle van driver at night, a crotchety old guy who hates 'them young people', and at the same time fluid, sometimes shocking sequences (there are allusions to Kosovo that come out of nowhere).
I always thought SW was a great example of myth in cinema.  A Galaxy Far, Far Away tackles the mythological and succeeds in doing it with humor.",1019779200,,1182,4.537735849056604
7958494,3,B0000633TW,"Kinda offbeat, but if you are interested in Star Wars fandom, it's worth watching once or twice.",1425772800,,96,4.705882352941177

7958496,5,B0000633TW,"I didn't know what to expect from a documentary about fandom, but I guessed it wouldn't be good.  Generally, this type of documentary leans in one of two directions: 1) it demonstrates how geeks are crazier than everyone else so ""normal"" people can feel better about themselves, or 2) it slavishly focuses on one aspect of a hobby to the exclusion of any negative commentary about the subject.

What's surprising about A Galaxy, Far, Far Away is that it actually provides a balanced view of the two perspectives by showing the extremes.  In essence, this is a journey about one producer trying to understand why everyone was so excited about Star Wars.

We're not talking about ""I like Star Wars"" kinds of fandom.  We're talking about camping out in front of a movie theater 42 days before the fourth entry in George Lucas' series.

I remember the days leading up to that first movie. There was Star Wars merchandise in every single store: shoe stores had Star Wars shoes, toy stores had Star Wars toys, book stores had Star Wars books, ad infinitum.  It finally struck me where else I had seen such cross-channel marketing...a holiday.

In essence, Lucas created a national holiday.  There was no merchant who wasn't somehow touched by the film's release.  Many of my coworkers took the day off to see it, just like it were a holiday.  A Star Wars holiday (not to be confused with the Star Wars holiday special).

Tariq Jalil, the director and narrator, takes us along on the journey to understand why Americans were so excited about what amounts to a couple hours of staring at a big screen. And he uncovers a couple of truths along the way.

Jalil interviews fans, from the rock star Jedi singing about the force to the technician who names his son Anakin, from the four kids who remind you of college chums camping out in front of a theater, to comedians who rap lyrics about the Force.  Jalil also interviews movie stars.  We hear from Roger Corman, James Duval, Andy Garcia, Meat Loaf, Joe Pesci, and other people Jalil forgot to turn the microphone on for.  Their assessments range from dismissive to supportive, from philosophical to freaked out.  Which pretty much reflects how everyone who isn't a fan felt about the phenomenon.

On the negative side, Jalil points out the extravagance.  Only in America could people huddle together in a crowd, clawing and fighting, to get the first Star Wars action figures.  He drives this point home by cutting in scenes of crowds in Kosovo scrambling for food.  It might sound like a heavy-handed approach until you realize just how similar the two scenes are. At one point I wasn't able to tell the difference.

As one observant young lady points out, the amount of money and manpower dedicated to providing security, food, transportation, and lodging to millions of Star Wars fans could change the world.  But Americans don't do that.  Instead, they spend it on a fantasy world...because they can.

If the documentary stopped there, it would be a horrible slam on fandom.  For a little while, I felt dirty afterwards for liking Star Wars.  But then Jalil then asks the tough questions. Forget asking why people like Star Wars when a camera is pointed in their face.  Ask them about their personal lives, and suddenly it all comes into focus.

Many of the kids in this documentary have issues with their fathers.  And they're not ""I don't like my dad"" issues either.  Their fathers are abusive or completely absent, situations where children have no childhood to speak of.  These kids like Star Wars so much because they dislike their lives in equal amounts.  The plot connects with them in ways that other media can't.

And that's the conclusion Jalil comes to.  Maybe the fans aren't perfect.  Maybe they could focus their efforts on something more constructive.  But there are a lot worse things.  If Americans want to believe in a mystical force of good, in the power for families to come together despite their differences, then maybe their devotion isn't so bad after all.  In the old days we used to call that religion.  Today, we call it Star Wars.",1142640000,14,4105,4.742937853107344
7958497,5,B0000633TW,"This was a blast to watch. Since it was filmed during the pre-TPM buildup, it serves not only has a humorous and sometimes serious look at the event, but is a cool time capsule as well. It's been 6 years but I can still remember opening night and it was bananas. Highly recommended.",1111881600,,282,4.339622641509434
7958498,2,B0000633TW,"I personally don't belong to any fandom, but I was interested in seeing this film because I have studied popular culture for some years now. The makers of the film claim this to be a documentary about the Star Wars fandom, but in reality they have tried to find the most geeky and weird fans out there and make them look stupid. It is obvious that the film makers don't really understand the phenomenon themselves, and the film won't give you any insight about it either. It might be funny and entertaining in its own way, but at the expense of other people.

Instead of really trying to understand the fans or interviewing academics who have actually studied popular culture, they have decided to ask the opinions of name actors and other famous people who have as little insight as themselves have, and who don't have anything interesting to say. The film goes through all the typical prejudices about fans: that they are sad people who have mental problems and can't tell the difference between fiction and reality. All this film does is spread further misconceptions about a particular group of people, which is sad. The technical part of the film doesn't always work either. Occasionly you can't hear what people are saying in the film. Some parts of the interviews have been subtitled, but there should have been a lot more.

Not recommended.",1106352000,7,1348,4.756410256410256
7958499,4,B0000633TW,"I just watched this documentary tonight. so, I thought I'd put my two cents worth into what I think about the DVD, as well as the Star Wars phenomenon in general.
  First off, I have to say that for the most part this DVD has been put together quite well. It has some pretty good rockin' background music, and it covers the phenomenon of Star Wars as well as the specific build up of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The only complaint I really have about the DVD is that the bonus features menu for the deleted scenes doesn't leave the last feature you just watched selected or the next feature selected in the list. In other words, after each deleted scene, you have to start from the top of the menu again instead of where you left off. But other than that, it's a well put together DVD. And the bonus features are good.
  I must say, even though I know how big Star Wars is, I never actually got to experience hype that big until watching this DVD. I knew about the crazy people camping out waiting a month and a half for the movie and whatnot. But to actually be a part of it I never was really. The most I've done was get in line two hours before the midnight showing on opening night of Episode II with my ticket in hand. And even that was a big event. But to actually have a documentary dive into different areas around the U.S. and talk to people waiting in line for 42 days and to just see all the craziness behind it is incredible.
  They documented the Toys 'R' Us mayhem of May 3, 1999 with legions of Star Wars fans lining up just to buy the new toys. They covered people who actually believe the force is real and claim Jedi as their religion. They interviewed famous stars like Meat Loaf and Joe Pesci about what their thoughts were on the Star Wars phenomenon. They talked about costumes, the lines, the toys, the ""religion,"" the force, the conventions, the lack of father figures in these geeks lives, etc. They even compared the crowds pushing each other around to get to the toy they want to the crowds in Kosova pushing each other around just to get food. Very ironic. They definitely did cover the phenomenon. So overall, it's a very interesting documentary.
  When I watched this DVD, I realized that I'm better off being a low-key fan like I am. Sure, I have a Star Wars website. Sure, I collect Star Wars stuff. Sure, I went to the midnight showing of Episode II. But I'm not insane and out of my mind like these people are. I mean, this documentary really shows how nuts these people actually are. Star Wars is their life. Maybe that's why I wasn't so let down by The Phantom Menace like some of these fans in the documentary were. I mean, they practically deserve to be let down. One shouldn't build up a movie, no matter how big of a movie it is, to be the second coming. One is destined for a let down then - even the director of this DVD, Tariq Jalil, says this in the commentary. Sure, there will always be people who will be let down no matter what. But has anyone noticed how many more fans were pleased with Attack of the Clones than with The Phantom Menace?  TPM had 16 years in the waiting, and enough inescapable hype in 1998 through May 1999 to sink us into a black hole. And that's exactly what happened. People got sucked into a black hole, thinking that the movie sucked beyond belief, when in reality it's only them that's the problem.  AOTC had only three years of waiting, and the hype was considerably low-key on purpose. And most fans walked out loving the film. The fan-base's opinion of the movie wasn't split down the middle like with TPM.
  So I'm glad that I didn't build these movies up to be more than movies. I mean, they are a phenomenon and one cannot escape that. And I don't think one should. It's good to be fascinated with something and to even make it a big part of your life. I don't get down on those fans for doing what they did. I think it's cool that they waited in line that long to see The Phantom Menace. I mean, the hype is fun and exciting. But it's when the hype alters the opinion of what should be a good movie that it gets to be too much. My advice for fans of Star Wars would be to basically get a life, but not forget about the movies. In other words, find other things to focus on, but still enjoy the genre that is Star Wars. It's a great hobby, and a great phenomenon that one should not be ashamed of being a part of. It's ok to have this hobby. But don't let it have you.",1034380800,19,4461,4.235294117647059
7958500,1,B0000633TW,"Really disappointing. You would think it wouldn't be hard to make a fascinating documentary about the world's obsession with Star Wars, and yet the filmmakers somehow manage to make it look like there's nothing to say. There's absolutely no reason there needs to be so much footage of them walking around talking about what they're doing. Nor do I need to see repeated scenes of guys playing the kazoo or a turntable-carrying Boba Fett. Really not worth the plastic disc it's laser-enscribed on.",1023062400,11,495,4.975903614457831
