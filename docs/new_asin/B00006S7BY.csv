7972930,2,B00006S7BY,"This VHS tape cassette is a nice introduction to Square Dancing but although 65 mainstream moves are mentioned in the description, a very few are actually covered.  We expected much more.  There certainly was enough room for more tape on the cassette to instruct many more moves and for the price, it should have been there.",1109030400,11,324,4.767857142857143
