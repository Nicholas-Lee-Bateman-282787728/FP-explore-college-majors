The first half of the work focuses on George W. and the Iraq War.  Because that president's term is ending and many of us are hoping for a certain victory from a certain Illinoisan, that didn't seem as pressing to me now.  The second half was more informative for me.  It speaks about the EU's power over American corporations.  It concludes by saying, ""With China and India rising in power, Europe and the US had better come up with a way to get along better.""  The work stated that Europe has far more non-Christians than the US has and that Americans don't know that keeping moderate religious people happy may be the key to getting radicals not to act violently.

There are some things I would do differently in this work.  Near the end, an American is interviewed saying, ""Europe will change when they have their own 9-11.""  However, earlier in the documentary, the narrator says Spanish voters ousted their leader when 200 citizens were killed in a terrorist attack.  The narrator presents accessible newborn care as a shocker or excessive, however, Europe does some of that because its birth rate is so low, unlike the rates in the US.  It has nothing to do with disagreements on foreign policy.

American Bush supporters won't feel left out in this discussion due to the narrator.  He asks Europeans, ""Why is the EU banning American cosmetics that may or may not cause cancer but every European who I see at caf'es are smoking all up in people's faces?""  He also asks, ""You French don't like us invading Iraq but you sure weren't complaining when we invaded France in the 1940s to get rid of its enemies.""  He even says Europe could afford such extensive social programs because the US was providing for its military needs.

This is the first time I've seen Friedman speak and move, as I've only read and seen him in print.  Even for video recorders, he has big, juicy lips just like comedian Steve Harvey.  Like in Skip Gates' documentaries, he dumbs things down for his audience.  He admits to being a Rhodes scholar (or something like that), then asks dumb questions like, ""You mean to say that many European countries have universal health care!?""  This program may be ""beneath"" him in some ways.",1216684800,,2449,4.742316784869977
