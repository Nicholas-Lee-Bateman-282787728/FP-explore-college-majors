8746013,5,B019TGK442,"Excellent. One of my all time favourites. I love the actors and even though the plot isn't too unique to it's genre, it's a fun, entertaining, cute movie that let's us see into the lives of Taiwanese teenagers in the 90's. I recommend it to anyone who loves a fun chic flick..",1465948800,,276,4.326923076923077
8746014,5,B019TGK442,"Great movie! Captures the nostalgia of the 90's really well.  Super sweet, funny and heartwarming, if you've ever had romantic daydreams of your favorite star, or spent your days trying to find ways to impress the boy you had a not-so-secret crush on, or realized that the person you love may be your best friend who's seen you through it all... or if you've just ever been a typical teenage high school girl then this movie is for you.  The Taiwanese title is actually, ""My Time as a Teenage Girl,"" but I think Our Times really works too because at the end of the day you may realize, like I did, that the movie is really talking about your teenage high schools days.  Absolutely loved this movie. It was filled with laughter and tears and all in a very good way.",1464566400,3,764,4.404255319148936
8746015,3,B019TGK442,"Our Times is ""a hit Taiwanese romance"" not likely to be appreciated out of context.

Plot 6/10: Trope central. We quickly go retro with workaholic protagonist Lin Truly taking us down memory lane to her high school days (in the 1990s). I'm not so sure about the ugly duckling trope; we first see the younger Lin with glasses and what I can only guess is supposed to be ugly hair. After ditching the glasses and getting a different cut, voil&agrave;! she is a catch. I didn't notice much of a difference, but then again, I don't read Vogue. There are two guys to keep track of: the ""boss"" of a school gang opposite the good boy (Lin's crush). This is no West Side Story, however. The gangs are comical, and there is no real sense of jeopardy until towards the end. There's another girl thrown into the mix just to complicate things (Minmin, who is as cute as a bug on Hello Kitty's nose... yes, I know Hello Kitty is Japanese, I'm only using a turn of phrase). The last 5-10 minutes of Our Times at least provides a couple twists, at once utterly predictable and slightly refreshing. In sum, Our Times should win an award for fitting in more tropes than any film ever.

Actors 8/10: No real complaints. Sure, I could pick some nits, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since I don't live in the ROC. Hong Kong Cantopop star Andy Lau Tak-wah shows up as himself (forgot to mention: Lin Truly has been wanting to see him in concert since she was a girl).

Direction & cinematography 8/10: Director Yu Shan Chen (a woman) made sure Our Times came together seamlessly. The cinematography ranges from good to excellent, albeit nothing groundbreaking.

Romance 9/10: As you may have guessed from the jacket's cover picture, Our Times is intended to be a romance. It can easily be classified as a romcom of the ""cute"" variety. Too cute for U.S. audiences (I'd venture to say), but if you can manage to sit through the first 2 hours (yeah, it's long) of Our Times, the end will give romantics what they crave.

North American appeal 4/10: Our Times knows its target demographic, and middle-aged white fellas like me is surely not it. Even young women in the States are not likely to latch onto this flick as something relatable. Sure, some things are universal if you are human (like puppy love and the love of puppies, both of which are present here), but Our Times is so cartoonish and sugary sweet that you just can't take it seriously unless you are, well, the target audience in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. The music is particularly awful (unless you actually are a fan of Cantonese / Mandarin pop music). Our Times mimics Hollywood flicks to an embarrassing degree, but things get lost in translation, which leads me to...

Humor 6/10: Our Times has its moments, but the laughs out of me were likely not intended by the screenwriter (instead, they had to do with cultural differences). There's a fat girl who is usually seen with food in hand [do I need to say more about that?] The humor is at times what you would expect from an American 1980s teen movie, but without the obligatory crudeness. Our Times is oddly sanitized but for randomly inserted expletives (which could be due to a translator who did the subtitles). I did occasionally laugh, but if I had been in a Taipei cinema it would have been out of sync with laughter from the audience.

Weirdness factor 8/10: Probably because I'm a North American, I found parts of Our Times bizarrely humorous, such as a school auditorium scene where we hear slightly metallic music (along the lines of Twisted Sister's ""We're Not Gonna Take It"") as the students rebel against a tyrannical school director. Big kids like me can only laugh at this student revolt (they ask to be punished, showing solidarity with a scapegoated student), with Lin Truly shouting, ""Director. I have something serious to report now. My skirt is 3cm higher than my knee. My socks are not 100% white. My jacket's zipper never pulled high enough. Please punish me, sir."" Twister Sister indeed. In contrast to Lin Truly's rather mild confession, another student tells the director to ""eat sh-t!""... leading me to say, ""WTF?""

Final thoughts: Cultural relativism is the term of the day when viewing this. I was absolutely not the target demographic for Our Times, but despite feeling a bit sick to my stomach from the maple syrup covered brown sugar that was being shoveled down my throat, I almost felt tears welling up in eyes for a second (don't tell anyone I said that).",1452297600,2,4504,4.62828535669587
