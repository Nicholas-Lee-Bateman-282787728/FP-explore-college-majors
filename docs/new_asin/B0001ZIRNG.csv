8019095,5,B0001ZIRNG,"This is a very compelling documentary about Native American struggles to protect places they consider sacred. Every time I watch it I see something new as beautiful visuals and excellent interviews reveal complex conflicts over landscapes we all love - Mt. Shasta, Devils Tower, the Hopi mesas. Lakota scholar Vine Deloria Jr. is the intellectual star of In the Light of Reverence, observing at the end: ""The basic problem is that American society is a 'rights society' not a 'responsibility society.' What you've got is each individual saying, 'Well, I have a right to do this.' Having religious places, and revolving your religion around that, means you are always in contact with the earth, you're responsible for it and to it."" You can get this film from Netflix on DVD. It is a very powerful educational tool in classrooms from 7th grade through college and starts wonderful discussions.",1224806400,,892,5.033783783783784
8019096,5,B0001ZIRNG,"This documentary showed in shocking clarity how the arrogance and greed of modern America has led to the destruction of some of the most sacred spaces and civilizations.  Be prepared to feel shock, disgust, and anger.  Highly recommended!",1196121600,2,238,5.2368421052631575
8019097,3,B0001ZIRNG,"Many people would think that tensions between Native Americans and whites are a thing of the past.  However, this documentary shows a schism between three tribes and white outsiders.

If non-Christians took over and did whatever they wanted to the Vatican City or Jerusalem, most Americans would be up in arms.  However, these tribes describe how certain mountains are sacred to them and yet the majority people pooh-pooh the idea.  People say ridiculous things like, ""Rock climbing is my religion!""  (I dare someone to go to their local church and assert that idea.)  Another fallacy is, ""They should respect our culture.""  Puh-leez!  White American culture is global and has no chance of disappearing like Native cultures seriously may.  The Eurocentricity in the Natives' foes is truly disheartening.

This may be a wonderful documentary for lawyers and law students to watch.  These controversies point to how the U.S. Constitution's rights of free speech and freedom of religion are inadequate.  In Western thought, churches can be placed anywhere and land is meant to be owned.  However, these tribes show that nature can be its own church.  Just having the right to say, ""I believe in X."" is simply insufficient.

Many people are used to thinking of Native tribes and environmentalists as natural allies.  However, here, along with corporations, nature-lovers and New Age religionists are to blame for the tribes' concerns.  This documentary tacitly looks at divisions between people on the Left.

Most Native American tribes have reservations in the West, rather than the East.  This documentary covers a diverse handful of Native tribes and their battles.  However, I wonder if Eastern tribes have already resolved some of these issues.  Did they lead the way, at least in terms of the law and property rights, that Western tribes could copy?

This documentary may frustrate and sadden many.  For those who know about the history of Federal Indian law, one sees that all interventions have been flawed.  Forcing Natives to practice Christianity, to attend boarding schools, or to own land as individuals has not helped anything.  This documentary shows, again, how there may be compromise, but no side will go home happy.",1117670400,7,2230,5.162011173184357
