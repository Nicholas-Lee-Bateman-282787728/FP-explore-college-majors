4498597,5,B004Y1P0GU,"I was wonderfully surprised by this movie. The format of it is unlike anything I've seen before, as you experience the same day (or set of days) through four different characters, and the day looks very different and sheds new insight depending on which character you are with, though each intersects with the other. It is an intimate and raw portrayal of a family coming to terms with themselves, who they are as individuals and how they fit together. I loved it, and consider myself quite a harsh film critic (there are very few films that I have continued to think about for as long afterwards as I have with this one). Highly recommended.",1355270400,5,642,4.640350877192983
4498598,3,B004Y1P0GU,"I will explain, but, first, the synopsis:

A woman, dying of cancer, celebrates her last Christmas with her family. Her spouse, who is more like an ""occasional husband,"" is distant from his responsibilities as husband and father. Her three daughters (Nina, Anna, and Christine) all have problems of their own, with Nina being a widow with two children, Anna is married and having an affair, and Christine, youngest and a med student, has lesbian urges. Each faces their own problems through their dying mother's words, who, in turn, must come to terms with her own past.

As a male viewer, and a person who has not to deal with any of the issues touched upon in the movie, I felt myself distanced from having any empathy for the characters. If, perhaps, I dealt with a parent who was dying in a matter of weeks, or I was a widow, or I was gay, or I had committed adultery, I might have been able to focus on at least one of the characters. My wife, too, had problems finding empathy with any of the characters. That doesn't say that the movie failed. It didn't quite do that. It is a complex character study with fine acting all around. I had sympathy, but not empathy, so a select audience is needed to at least enjoy the movie and find the characters more interesting.

There are flaws with the movie:

For one (and this is a BIG problem): I am one of those people who believe that sound is the most difficult and important element in filmmaking. I don't know whether it is the DVD release (by Film Movement) which is the problem, or that the sound work was just bad. I tend to believe (due to the several stereo sound scenes that worked on my speakers) that it is definitely the movie. I had to adjust the volume several times, because, whoever did the mixing and on-site sound work was not a great pick! Examples: Music would often drown out dialogue. The tracks do not seem to be mixed properly. Dialogue in several of the scenes (without the music) would also be echo-y or muffled. I had to constantly turn the volume up and replay scenes. There are sound edits (from one scene to the next) where there would be a very harsh sound (of an item on-screen, like the dropping of a fork) that would just be ear-shattering and inappropriate, given the scene. A better example would be the 2-4 note piano soundtrack that sounded like my little children pounding on the high-pitched notes! That happens many times in the movie. The final musical number and lyrics are inappropriate for the ending of the movie. It was like the director, during post-production, threw something in there for financial (budgetary) reasons, and not because it was needed.

Another problem I had is this (constantly) unnecessary hand-held camera effect, that seems to be the staple product of cinema and television. Film makers MUST understand the reasoning behind the use of hand-held camerawork, which has now become a FAD and NOT A PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT. I do understand the use of the hand-held, but this movie would be more powerful without it. The movie owes alot, and I mean ALOT, to Ingmar Bergman! Ingmar didn't need hand-held ALL of the time. There is this passionate need to use one by newer filmmakers. NO, STOP!

The movie also misses by attempting to be subjective, or, even more apt, either a documentary or a third (unseen) person document. The director jars the movie by giving the daughters interviews, but then the acknowledgment of the camera is gone. A bad sign of filmmaking is doing this. The ""interviews"" are unnecessary. Let the story play itself out. Again, what works in ""The Office"" and ""Modern Family"" - and you really need to examine those TV shows and it's documentary style - doesn't mean that because it works there that it will work ALL of the time.

Lastly, the story of Christine, the youngest. Her segment is the shortest of them all, and the other two stories could have easily been as short. The character is a med student, but the actress looks like an 18-year-old. She's just too young-looking and her actions are more of an 18-year-old, not a med student. Even if you do believe it, her story seems to be the advertising and selling point of the movie, but this is erroneous. Just so a movie has a lesbian character (just look at the cover - a scene at the end of the movie, just before the ending credits), doesn't mean everyone should go out and buy the product. Her story is the shortest, but also the weakest, because it doesn't hardly touch upon her personal relationship at all. The character broods and the actress seems to not be able to play the character (which is probably the fault of how she is written). She is even angry in a couple of scenes, but, when her two sisters' stories are told in-depth, her story is lacking any depth. However, to be fair, her story, separate from her sisters, is used to bond mother to daughter - the ""coming to terms"" story.

Overall, not a bad film for a first-and-only-feature director, but not a great movie, either. Good effort, but lacking in quality production and post-production ways (I realize that it is a low-budget movie), but being sloppy is no excuse. Acting is very good, as is the Bergmanesque narrative. The movie could easily be a companion piece to (and be cross-analyzed with) Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries."" Note the red-painted rooms.

3 of 5 stars, mostly because of problems with quality of the work and loss of empathy with characters - I am not the right viewer, and neither is my wife. 4 stars for great acting and mother-daughter narrative. Good try, but not a horrible mess.",1331596800,4,5565,4.624493927125506

This is a film about a dying mother and her three daughters, and how her last gift to her children is to tell them the truth and leave them with a sense of their own lovable nature.  The acting is superb, the sense of each character is more three dimensional and realistic than we are used to in our own films, and the subject matter is coming to terms with your life before it is over. I did really love this movie, but I would recommend it to people who are willing to enter into that twilight area of grieving and letting go with an open heart.  This will not be the movie you want to watch for entertainment or distraction or escapism.  This movie was well suited to me, as I am going through a period of loss, and I appreciated the writing, acting, and filmic structure.  Well done, but not for everyone.",1426636800,13,841,4.2375
