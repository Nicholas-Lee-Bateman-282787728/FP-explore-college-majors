8745879,4,B019R19HV0,"CPO Sharkey: The Best of Season Two is a collection of six complete broadcast episodes from the second and final season of the sitcom as they originally aired on NBC-TV. Don Rickles, known for his trademark insult comedy, stars as 24-year naval veteran Chief Petty Officer Otto Sharkey. Stationed at the Navy Training Center in San Diego, California, Sharkey is in charge of a company of new recruits. Its his job to make sailors out of a collection of diverse ethnic types, most of whom have never been away from home before. Despite his verbal barbs and withering looks, he has the heart of a softie.

The New Captain, the first episode of Season Two, finds Sharkey fuming when his beer belly comes under attack from a tough new captain (Richard X. Slattery). In Sharkey Flies Over the Cuckoos Nest, Sharkey goes in for a routine physical at the base hospital and is mistaken for a psychiatric patient. Natalie, Sharkeys girlfriend, accuses him of being insensitive in Close Encounters of the Worst Kind. Captain Buckner is ordered to take on Sharkey as his personal aide in Captains Right-Hand Man, and an upcoming flight unnerves the navy CPO in Fear of Flying. The Used Car Caper, which was the series final episode, airing on April 28, 1978, finds Sharkey bailing out his men by foiling a crooked used-car dealer.

There are no bonus features on the single-disc DVD.",1459036800,,1372,4.784810126582278
