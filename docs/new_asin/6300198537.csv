222640,5,6300198537,"I saw this movie years ago, and am glad it is still available on video.  It's remarkable for many reasons:  a superb musical score by Francis Lai (he wrote the music for ""A Man and a Woman,"" and this film's score has the same emotional tone); Charles Bronson's wonderful portrayal of a complex character; top-notch acting all around; a well-concieved plot with enough twists to keep you wondering; and a lush, handsome presentation.
It does all this without being overly arty or self-conscious.  It's a movie that's very easy to watch, and very easy to like.",1048118400,,558,4.791666666666667
222641,5,6300198537,"This is not a guy movie or a femminist movie.
This is the the story of a young fiance and daughter who is not able to ask for help when she is attacked and thinks she has to handle things herself.  Charles Bronson is the Detective who comes, after the fact, and figures out what happened. He ends up protecting her. The story has a different twist at the end, and is a wonderful portrayal of small town girl in over her head and
rescued by the big city, hard as nails, honorable cop.  Must have for Charles Bronson fans.",1006819200,6,520,4.19

222663,4,6300198537,"From the days when Charles Bronson was yet to be typecast as cops or vigilantes and was working his way up to stardom in continental thrillers, Rene Clement's Rider in the Rain is an interesting psychological cat-and-mouse thriller that never really scales the heights but is a lot more intriguing that much of the star's more generic output. Marlene Jobert is raped by an intruder she subsequently kills, but out of a sense of shame - and possibly concerns over her jealous husband - disposes of the body rather than reporting it to the police, only for Charles Bronson's American stranger to suddenly start intruding on her life and asking her why she killed him. It soon becomes clear that he's got an agenda of his own that doesn't necessarily involve the police as he threatens, plies her with liquor and brings to the surface memories of her troubled childhood, with the odd reference to Alice in Wonderland (such as Bronson being described as having a Cheshire Cat smile) implying that all may not be as it seems as their relationship gets curiouser and curiouser...

A kind of companion piece to the more devious Someone Behind the Door, critics loved it back in 1970, Bronson thought enough of it to try to remake it in 1983 while Jim Morrison was reportedly so taken with it he was inspired to write Riders on the Storm, but it's more decent than great, feeling like it could have benefited from being shorter and tighter than its near two-hour running time. Optimum's UK DVD earns an extra star for including both the English language version and the simultaneously shot French-language version - not a dubbed print (although Bronson is dubbed) but alternate takes, running four minutes longer. There's no additional footage beyond a slightly longer and more detailed end credits sequence, more a case of a slightly different tempo and much better performances from the French and Italian co-stars (Jobert's mother is also allowed to be a bit warmer towards her in the French version). There are no other extras but a decent widescreen print which is infinitely superior to the atrocious UK public domain issue from Orbit Media that had been the only way to see the film for a long time. Both have the same cover image, so be careful you order the Optimum release.",1390608000,5,2275,4.788804071246819

222675,5,6300198537,I loved the book and loved the movie and I love Charles Bronson.  I had previously owned both the book and the movie but gave them to my sister who was having trouble finding them so then I had to replace my copies because there are enough twists and turns in this story to warrant reading and/or seeing it again and again and again.  I highly recommend both the book and the movie.,1382400000,,382,4.219178082191781
222676,3,6300198537,"Not a bad story for its period. However it reminds me of the Kenneth More character in ""39 Steps"". Both male leads have a condescending attitude toward 'NAIVE' ladies. Maybe that helps one identify this as a 'Period Piece'.",1353628800,,223,4.743589743589744

222678,2,6300198537,"***Update Feb 2010 - Optimum Home Entertainment in the UK have released Rider On The Rain on Region 2 DVD and can be found on Amazon.co.uk. The transfer is perfect and has the English and French versions, but you will need a Region free DVD player. If ordering Optimum's DVD release, do not get it mixed up with Orbit Media's release of Rider On The Rain which has similar cover art and is an even worse version than this Region 1 release.***

I got my DVD through [...], the cover art is the same as this one listed on Amazon, DVD sleeve is purple in colour with a photo of Bronson(waste up on the right side of the DVD cover with Bronson facing to the left) in a dark gray t-shirt (photograph is not related to this film), the words RIDER and RAIN appear in large capitalised red lettering with ""on the"" in lower case white lettering along with Bronson's name also in white in lower case lettering with the C and B capitalised, all top centre of the DVD cover. The [...] version is half the price of the amazon.com version.

Assuming these are the same DVD transfers, it is another public domain non DVD quality release. It appears to be taken from a medium quality VHS. It is anamorphic as described on the [...] website and it also does appear to be in widescreen although I'm not sure if it is original aspect ration widescreen but nothing appears obvious to be missing from the left or right based on the framing of scenes. I watched this DVD through a projector onto a 140"" screen so perhaps the following picture quality description may not be as negative on a 30"", 40"" or 50"" TV screen, the picture quality is watchable but is very soft in places with background actors, buildings, objects etc having no detail at times which is expected from a VHS copy. The image did not have any major print damage or scratches, it looks like what it is, a fairly worn VHS transfer to DVD. Again as listed on the [...] website, this is indeed in 5.1 surround sound, the actors dialogue comes through crisp and clear through all speakers attached to my home theater amp and all ambient sound effects are also crisp and clear albeit with a very low minor hissing sound which is not that noticeable, however the same can not be said for the musical score which at times for some reason sounds like a CD player running off batteries that are almost dead but still trying to play the CD, that's the best way I can think to describe it. Strangely though, during scenes where the musical score is played along with dialogue, the dialogue is perfectly fine. I also noticed that the transfer seems to be cropped slightly top and bottom, at times during the opening of particular scene's, it appears as if the camera is positioned just a little to low cutting of the actors heads from the nose up until the camera moves into the scene and the framing corrects itself.

I read up on the Orbit Media DVD released in the UK and I checked if the cuts made by Orbit Media to their version are intact in this version. This DVD version appears to be intact and uncut. As I have only just now watched this film for the first time, I can not be sure that the film is here 100% in its entirety but it does appear to be so.

I really did enjoy this Bronson film and I wish that a respectable DVD distributor will find a high quality print and release this on DVD properly but for now from reading about other public domain versions of this film, I think this DVD version might just be a case of the best we will get until that time.",1212278400,24,3506,4.348091603053435
222679,2,6300198537,"I had been anticipating the release of this movie on DVD for a long time, but what a disappointment it turned out to be.  The picture is about the same as my old Star VHS tape, but the sound is a disaster.  The Francis Lai score sounds like an old tape recorder in its death throes.  This appears to be a bootleg item.  Judging from the reviews here, Amazon should pull this item and return all copies to the distributor -- if they can be found.  Save your money until a better release comes out.",1209945600,5,496,4.178947368421053
222680,1,6300198537,"Without a doubt the worst ""B"" movie made and damn sure NOT worth $13.98!!
The only reason Jill Ireland (this was her worst) ever got in any movies is because she was married to Charles Bronson, and her small part was pitiful. Charles was not his best in this one but you have to remember this was made in 69', and the fight's well it's bad to!

222681,2,6300198537,"The movie is fairly good, this DVD release is not.  Trinity Home Entertainment, (AKA 905 ENTERTAINMENT) released another DVD which I unfortunately purchased.  Beware this releaser.  This release suffers from VHS video quality and horrible wow on the audio track, rendering the background music unlistenable.  I have to wonder if Trinity has legally gained the reights to release these movies on DVD as the quality is so poor.  Someone should investigate them.  A web search does not produce much in the way of an address or location, or otherwise who these people are.  Amazon should investigate just who they are buying from.  The products from this releaser are worse than anything I have seen from any other source.  Beware ""The Next Man"" on DVD starring Sean Connerly.  The original source had to be a slow speed VHS recording of a TV broadcast of the movie, there were obvious reception distortion problems plus the run time was shortened to that allowable by a 2 hour broadcast, ie; 93 minutes or so.",1182902400,7,1006,4.864705882352941
222682,4,6300198537,"I saw this film on its run in US theaters in 1970.  Not unlike a Hitchcock film, the tension is built on character development.  Bronson still a bit before he reached superstar popularity, in an understated, superb performance. But for me, his co-star, Marlene Jobert, really heats up the screen, with a complex, multi-layered portrayal, in this sophisticated tale of rape, survival, romance. Clement's direction deserves recognition: the rich hues, the weather blend with continually fluctuating moods on a rather intimate level to tell the story. Good show.",1165795200,3,559,5.340909090909091
222683,5,6300198537,"Director Rene Clement's top quality thriller, ""Rider on the Rain"" (1969) (I don't know where this ""Rider in the Rain"" keeps popping up!), is based on a Sebastien Japrisot story, probably one of his best if they all are not  (""Trap for Cinderella"" (never filmed) and ""Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun"" with Samantha Eggar (NOT on video) were exceptional) and should be viewed as the re-start of his career as we all sat back in 1969 and waited for his ""next film"" which turned out to be ""The Deadly Trap"" with Faye Dunaway and Frank Langella, also very good and not available on video.  The old pro, Clement (""Purple Noon,"" ""Joy House"" and ""Forbidden Games"" (just a few)) had become a new ""auteur"" with ""Rider ON the Rain"" never mistaken  for ""in the rain"" as with this DVD pressing the movie sounds like it is ""under water."" Marlene Jobert as ""Melancoly"" steals the film from Charles Bronson in this his comeback picture.  It ceases to amaze me ""what people will do"" and this DVD printing is one of the worst I've ever bought.  (I have a feeling ""Rider in the Rain"" is a catch-all for the relentlessly poor DVD pressing and they wouldn't even bother to make the title certain).  Am I supposed to be thankful for such a poor quality DVD pressing?  Is it asking too much?  Actually, the picture is a masterpiece.  It makes the blending of the Hitchcock/Japrisot that there will never be as close as possible.  Honors to Clement, Jobert for the exquisite performance as ""Melancoly"" and Bronson.",1164672000,18,1497,4.593984962406015

222695,1,6300198537,"Some poor sound... really just the music and at times a little unclear picture. But the film has a great plot and Bronson is at his best as a tough but caring hero, well worth having for any Bronson fan.........",1158710400,4,211,4.3

222697,2,6300198537,"..apparently a GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER from 1970...

I'm sure Charles Bronson fans will find plenty to enjoy with this DVD (oddly enough, even fans of early 70s italian horror might find this to be up their alley)...Anyone who is familiar with these ""fly by night"" DVD companies should know what to expect out of the transfer...VHS quality with pretty shaky sound.
Whats sad/interesting ultimately for me is that this is directed by Rene Clement... a man with a long history with just as many fans as detractors. Being someone that has never been a big fan of the guy, I can't tell you how his style ultimately mutated to this. But its sad to me when you consider that his contemporaries like Bresson were striving to achieve cinematic truth and perfection at the very same time that Clement had resorted to this (bloodless thriller) revenge ""flick"". Fans of late 60s, early 70s eurotrash horror,drive-in films will find plenty to enjoy. Casual fans of Clement's early work might find this to be a bit depressing (especially after witnessing the uninspired rape scene that was more akin to a slasher film than a ""masterful"" director). I bought the thing for archival purposes only...the same reason I own a copy of Edward Dmytryk's SHALAKO (starring Sean Connery and Brigette Bardot, if you can imagine! ha). This DVD is presented in the FULL SCREEN format...I could not find whether this is the theatrical release format or not.
p.s. the freckle faced protagonist in this movie is pretty damn cute!",1146700800,,1495,4.862745098039215
222698,3,6300198537,"""Rider"" is an interesting flick, but has an odd disregard for logic that reminds me of David Lynch's film noir takes or Dario Argento's films (without the blood). I'm not sure if this was on purpose or not.
This particular DVD, however, is just a digital transfer of a VHS master; thus it replicates the look of an old VHS tape perfectly! For the price, it's better than nothing for the Bronson fan, but a very, very far cry from an actual digital master of the film.

ps-- The film is not, as previously stated, ""dubbed flawlessly."" It was filmed in two versions--one in French with Bronson dubbed, one in English with the main French actors all speaking English along with Bronson (some minor characters are dubbed--though not flawlessly).",1141603200,12,741,4.744186046511628
222699,4,6300198537,"This movie is not your typical Charles Bronson movie. Of course...Bronson is Bronson and he is as menacing as ever in this but the movie is not a typical Bronson film. There is no ultra high body count and piles of dead bodies and bullet casings at the hands of Bronson. It is a story that centers more around the female star and her perdicament. She is alone in her house while her hubby is away. She is then brutally assaulted and raped by a stranger who breaks into their home. She then manages to kill her attacker. She tries to dump the body and cover up the crime. Enter Bronson as a stranger who seems to know more than he is letting on and who also menaces the young brutalized woman. Is he friend or foe? Is he hero or villian? What is his connection to he rapist, to the crime, to the girl? This all leads to a very good movie and one of the best roles that Bronson had ever sunk his teeth into. For all you fans of the killing machine Bronson movies, you may be disappointed by this movie because it is heads and tails above any of them but not full of all the action and adventure that they had. But for all of you fans of good movies and fans of Bronson the actor I think you will enjoy this movie. It is a foreign film but the copy I have is dubbed flawlessly and is done very well and you never even notice that it is a foreign flick but if you do it actually adds to the richness of the story and the acting.",1140739200,5,1424,4.035335689045937

""No one ever comes by bus"" Melody explains to her mother as she watches. ""Then he must have come in on the rain.""

Its definitely one of his more unusual roles and you get to see his more comedic side at times. The film is heavy on atmosphere and it might take you a couple of viewings before you really ""get it"".

I own two biographies of Bronson and he is quoted as stating that this film and Red Sun are probably his personal favorites. Rider on the Rain(1969) was really the first film where Bronson was the only starring male. His huge fame in France began with Honor Among Thieves(1968) but he co-starred with Alain Delon in that film. In Rider on the Rain, Bronson's acting shows quite a broad range and is literally fun to watch. I often wonder how he would have done with a comedy role. With the right director and the right script, Bronson was actually capable of acting with a humorous twinkle in his eye. In Rider on the Rain, Bronson gets to show confidence, anger, sympathy, affection, violence, determination, and a curious fearlessness. His female co-star, Marlene Jobert, is a wonderful mix of helplessness and strength and adds tremendously to the films overall success. Of course, the directing and the dialogue also add greatly but in this particular film, without Bronson's presence, the film would have, in my opinion, failed thoroughly.
