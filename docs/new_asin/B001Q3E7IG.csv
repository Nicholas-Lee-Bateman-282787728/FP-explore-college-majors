3762617,1,B001Q3E7IG,This is not a movie. It is a number of seemingly random images and dialog pulled together in the order of what is suggested but denied as the story of a very famous artist. Imagery is very striking and poses are pulled from deep shadows reminiscent of works by Caravaggio. That's it.,1317081600,4,283,4.461538461538462
3762618,5,B001Q3E7IG,"A recent trip to Italy, and seeing numerous paintings by Caravaggio, piqued my interest in his life & work. Subsequently I have sought out several books & movies (from Amazon) devoted to his story. What emerged was a fascinating tale of an artistic individual who rocked the Renaissance art world with his (at the time) revolutionary dramatic use of light and dark and naturalistic realism in his paintings, As is often the case, such originality was controversial in its' time with the art establsihment and Caravaggio's personal penchant for associating with the 'common people'  put him at odds with the religious power structure that was the source for most of the large commissions to artists of that day.  Apparently, Caravaggio so offended the sensibilities of his time that there was a concerted effort to suppress many of his works and it was only with a relatively recent resurgence of interest in his work that many of his pieces have been 're-discovered' and properly attributed to his hand. This DVD biopic is an Italian production (originally aired as a lengthy TV mini-series) and it gives a pretty accurate accounting of the major events in his life and the mood of the period in which he worked.  As an artist myself, I found the 'appreciation' for talented painters back in the Renaissance to be very interesting - they were regarded almost like 'rock-stars' and their talent was greatly respected and sought after by monied collectors.  It was this 'status' that seemingly saved Caravaggio's life on numerous occasions - along with certain deep personal connections to powerful families in the elite political structure.  It was a turbulent time that he lived in and his rebellious nature got him consistently in trouble and kept him on the run from his enemies-hastening his premature death .

Having also watched the more 'creative' take on Caravaggio's life lensed by British film-maker Derek Jarman - I would say I found this Italian version more satisfying in terms of really re-creating a sense of the period and the artist's angst and motivations. The cinematography is exceptional and captures a sense of the light of Caravaggio's canvases and there are many instances showing 'set-ups' for specific well known paintings. This is a long watch (nearly 4 hours) broken into 2 parts and it covers the artist's life from age 6 until his ignominious death at age 39.  The principle actors were all excellent in their roles and the lead bore a striking resemblence to the real Caravaggio, as he depicted himself in several of his paintings.  This film really captures the feeling of these tumultuous times of immense political intrigue and artistic invention - highly recommended.",1306195200,19,2701,5.026845637583893
3762619,4,B001Q3E7IG,"Although it's a long movie and perhaps a couple of parts might have been left out or done differently, the pathos of such a life in history is gripping. We get a glimpse into the eccentricities and the uncompromising creative standards of these classic artists, and one can only wonder in amazement at what the ""others"" must have been like (Beethoven, DaVinci, etc.). The story is so powerful and the acting so authentic that I didn't even notice the sub titles.  A must see for anybody interested in great entertainment, excellent acting, and seeing another example of the power of the human spirit in history. jhhms",1296432000,6,617,4.820754716981132
3762620,5,B001Q3E7IG,"I'm a longtime Caravaggio fan and thoroughly enjoyed this film. Perhaps a little more romantic than biographic, still entertaining nonetheless.

Had it been in English instead of Italian, I could have enjoyed the beautiful scenery better (my focus was on the subtitles, afterall), but this is not the fault of the film, rather of my ignorance in not speaking Italian (to that end, dubbing would be a nice feature here, but it's not offered). Casting was wonderful (several of the actors/actresses actually resembled the figures in the masters' work), the story was compelling and engaging, and even though you know what happens next, you're still held in suspense.",1296345600,5,664,5.148148148148148
3762621,4,B001Q3E7IG,"Part 1 at 100 min, Part 2 at 109 min, compressed onto one disk. (An earlier DVD, from 01 Distribution, was only 130 min, and was critcized for its gaps. I find no reliable info for a 6-hr version--the story can hardly be stretched to such length.) There are no supplements. The optional English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack are of the ""hearing-impaired"" type, and verbally denote the sound effects.

Physical aspects of this international co-production are fine, as is the cinematography. The musical score, sometimes with chorus and soprano, appears frequently. The script follows Caravaggio from 6 years old, when his village is struck by plague, to his death from abandonment, fever, and exhaustion at age 39. Many ""facts"" of his life and artistic endeavors, his friends and enemies, are woven into the script, and the film moves along at a fast pace. But the script shuns literary qualities, such as the English writers bring to their tv series, and maintains a connect-the-dots simplicity. Alesio Boni as Caravaggio is called upon for much action but little depth-acting.

I think the film was made by the ""dub-everything"" Italian method. First, capture the images without microphones. Subsequently, have the actors, or even alternative voice-actors, in the recording studio add the dialogue to segments. This process can result in some over-emphatic deliveries.

So, the film is a first-class production, which you'll enjoy watching. But like me, you may find it does not elicit emotional involvement.",1284249600,17,1515,5.226337448559671
3762622,4,B001Q3E7IG,"(Not to be confused with the Derek Jarman version.)

According to IMDb, the original Italian ""Caravaggio"" (2007), two-episode TV mini-series, runs 180 minutes, which I have not seen. The 130 minute version that I watched is far from perfect. The narrative is rushed and too many characters clutter up the screen, but the film is still worth watching for the star Alessio Boni's dedicated acting as Caravaggio, and the ravishing photography of three-time Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro.

""Caravaggio"" follows the life of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610), an Italian painter, whose life had been the central theme of films and TV shows several times before, most notably in Derek Jarman's 1986 film (Tilda Swinton's debut). The new Italian film is more conventional in its narrative structure, with key episodes of his life including his illness, success and brawls in Rome, subsequent troubles, and death.

Caravaggio lived in the same period of Shakespeare, and like Shakespeare some part his life is still shrouded in mystery. Instead of speculating on the biographical background, the new film focuses the complex personality of the artist, who is fascinated with the worlds of light and darkness. Alessio Boni turns in strong performance as Caravaggio, but what makes the film special is the camera of Vittorio Storaro, which captures the contrast of light and shadow so beautifully.

The 130 minute version is deeply flawed with its hurried narrative pace and loose threads, but the lush cinematography, and the nice costume and production designs make up for it. The film also includes a few sword fight sequence, and they are surprisingly thrilling.",1270166400,22,1667,5.279245283018868
8334943,5,B001Q3E7IG,"I  found this movie very convincing, having gotten  my Masters Degree in Art History at Hunter College.  The paintings of Caravaggio are beautifully shown and the artist's short temper in full display.  His love life isn't fully shown: I he was bisexual at the least.  I have a score of books on the artist,  including one called M which is very informative. It has been years since I've read them.  I've visited Rome and Milan and seen all his paintings save the great ones in Malta.  Alessio Boni is a fine actor and all of the cast performs well.  The Director deserves credit for creating a fast-moving film that captures the period to perfection.  Even if you don't know Italian the subtitles are hardly necessary: the pictures tell the whole story.",1525219200,,754,4.687022900763359

A genius, exploited by others and by his own inner demons makes for a most memorable and moving experience for the viewer, at least for me!  I would definitely recommend viewing it!
