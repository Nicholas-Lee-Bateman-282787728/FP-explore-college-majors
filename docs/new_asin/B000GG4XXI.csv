2610745,5,B000GG4XXI,"LEGEND VS. LEGEND KILLER MATCH - HULK HOGAN VS. RANDY ORTON

Randy has been saying that he will fight Hogan at some point or another, and he finally acted by challenging Hogan to a Legend vs. Legend Killer match at SummerSlam. Orton later RKO'd Hulk onto his own car trunk. Both men are undefeated in singles matches at SummerSlam, and Randy would end Hulk's record by 'killing' off the biggest Legend of all time! I don't like Hogan much (he has a way too big ego!), but he can wrestle well. Randy is the best in the business and always makes matches great, so this would be a classic match-up. No matter how big Hogan's ego is, the WWE can't let Randy lose another Legend vs. Legend Killer match (i.e. the stupid decision of letting Undertaker beat Randy at WrestleMania 21) or else he will lose his entire image. I think that Orton will win similar to how he beat Angle at Vengeance, i.e. Hulk gets pushed into the exposed turnbuckle, Orton then grabs a chair and tries to hit Hogan, Hogan moves and hits the Big Boot, Orton moves out of the way of the Legdrop, and connects with the awesome RKO! Brooke Hogan will then be at ringside for Randy's matches as they may become the new TV couple (or something like that - wonder if Orton will apear on Hogan Knows Best). This will makes Randy a legend in himself! As Hogan is so egotistic, this will definetly be the main event, but he just can't be allowed to win! RKO rules!

Winner: 'LEGEND KILLER' RANDY ORTON

10/10

WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - WORLD CHAMPION KING BOOKER (W/ SHARMELL) VS. BATISTA

I'm not sure who will win this, as WWE might be waiting until No Mercy before Batista wins the gold back and then he can retain until WrestleMania 23, but I'm still going with Batista. This match should be amazing, as it will be all about Batista and his rise to the top once again! Batista is the best on SmackDown!, and I'm guessing the Scissors Kick will be attempted, missed, and Batista hits the Levithan Spinebuster and then the Batista Bomb for the win (hopefully).

Winner: (NEW WORLD CHAMPION) BATISTA

10/10

LAST ENCOUNTER - STREET FIGHT FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP - WWE CHAMPION EDGE (W/ LITA) VS. JOHN CENA

Edge won the WWE gold by pinning RVD on July 3rd edition of RAW, but it was Cena's F-U that knocked Van Dam out. Cena and Edge will most likely collide in a 'Last Encounter' Street Fight (No DQ/ No Holds Barred etc.), but Edge will definetly retain. Edge needs a longer title reign this time, and Cena is rumoured to be going back to SmackDown! This match should be brutal, with Steel Chairs, Steel Ring Steps etc. Edge will hold onto the title until Unforgiven when he will lose to Randy Orton (who NEEDS another WWE/ World Championship reign) or maybe to Triple H. Lita will help Edge win, and Cena might then go back to SmackDown! and start a war with Batista for the World Title. There are rumours of this match being Edge or Cena vs. Kane - with Cena rumoured to win the title back on July 24th edition of RAW. If it is the Champ vs. Kane then Kane will win and finally become the new WWE Champion!

Winner: WWE CHAMPION EDGE (OR KANE IF THE MATCH CHANGES)

9/10

2-ON-7 NO DQ HANDICAP MATCH - D-GENERATION X VS. SPIRIT SQUAD, SHANE & MR. MCMAHON

This match would be great, as long as it doesn't go in the main event instead of the Legend vs. Legend Killer match. D-X will win, but they won't stay around after SummerSlam as HBK needs knee surgery and Triple H wants the WWE Championship...again. Triple H might 'shock' everybody by nailing HBK with a Sledgehammer after the match, giving an 'injury' excuse for HBK leaving WWE for a while. There will be blood, and lots of Sweet Chin Music and Pedigrees! And the McMahons will bow down to King!

Winners: D-GENERATION X

8/10

ECW CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - ECW CHAMPION BIG SHOW VS. RVD VS. KURT ANGLE

This would be interesting to see, and Big Show's ECW gold will be defended at SummerSlam against somebody. Angle is the best on ECW besides Van Dam, though because RVD was suspended he has to lose the WWE and ECW Championships. RVD's high-flying extreme moves combined with Angle's great technical wrestling and Big Shows strength gives us a very unpredictable match-up, but I'm going with Angle, as he hasn't ever been beaten at SummerSlam.

Winner: NEW ECW CHAMPION KURT ANGLE

8/10

LAST RIDE MATCH - UNDERTAKER & KANE VS. THE GREAT KHALI & KHOSROW DAIVARI

This will be brutal, with the losers leaving the WWE. Undertaker will win again at the Great American Bash thanks to Kane, and he will Tombstone Khali and Kane will Chokeslam Daivari before making them Rest in Peace! Khali and Khosrow will leave WWE after this.

Winner: UNDERTAKER & KANE - BROTHERS OF DESTRUCTION!

9/10

INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - I.C. CHAMPION JOHNNY NITRO (W/ MELINA) VS. CARLITO (W/ TRISH STRATUS)

After seeing what happened at Vengeance between these two and Shelton Benjamin, this match should be great. Nitro will lose the gold here, and Carlio can take home what he should have won at Vengeance...now that's cool! Expect some brawling from Nitro, and some innovative high-flying moves from Carlito. Trish will take out Melina and help Carlito win.

Winner: (NEW INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPION) CARLITO

9/10

UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - U.S. CHAMPION FINLAY VS. LASHLEY

As Lashley can't fight now at the Bash, Finlay will retain against Regal and it will be Finlay against Lashley at SummerSlam. This will be no different to any of their other matches, except that the Little B@$tard will be under the ring for Finlay.

Winner: (NEW UNITED STATES CHAMPION) LASHLEY

7/10

NO DQ MATCH - MICK FOLEY (AS CACTUS JACK) VS. RIC FLAIR

I don't know if this will happen at SummerSlam or at Unforgiven, as there might be to many hardcore-style matches at SummerSlam for this to go ahead. If it does, it should be about as long as their Vengeance match, but with Barbed-Wire Tables, Steel Chairs, and Foley's favourite: the Barbed-Wire 2X4! Foley should win, as he needs a good singles win on PPV this year. Ths will be as hardcore as Edge vs. Foley at 'Mania 22!

Winner: MICK FOLEY

10/10

EDDIE GUERRERO TRIBUTE MATCH - REY MYSTERIO VS. CHRIS BENOIT (SPECIAL REFEREE: CHAVO GUERRERO)

I don't think that Chavo will turn on Rey...yet...as they have been close since Eddie died, and Benoit was also a great friend of Eddie. I think that this has a good chance of happening, with Benoit returning after injury and Rey losing at the Bash. Benoit will win with the Crossface, and they will all honour Eddie after the match. The tribute match couldn't happen at ECW because of Benoit's injury, but it could happen here.

WINNER: CHRIS BENOIT

2610748,4,B000GG4XXI,"The most recognizable figure in sports entertainment history returned to summerslam to face the legend killer randy orton. Unfortunately, Hogan's ailments were more visible and apparent than ever which downgraded the match to mostly brawling. The match came to a close when hogan kicked out of the rko and eventually hit his patented leg drop for the 1 2 3. In spite of hogan's bad knees, hip, and back, orton and hogan manage to pull off a decent match. Another notable match was edge vs. cena for the wwe title. Not much to say about this one since these two faced each other numerous times on ppv and on raw. Another pretty good match between these two. Edge retains the title. As far as king booker vs. Batista goes, i can sum up my thoughts on this match with a word from Farooq (ron simmons): DAMN! (accompanied by a disgusted look). DX versus the mcmahons was pretty good though. The beginning of the match was lame, however. DX did their part of giving the fans one of the best matches of the ppv. Lastly, Big show vs. sabu basically resembled a watered down wwe hardcore match. The mere presence of hogan at this event combined with the fighting between DX and the mcmahons carried this show. The card was attractive on paper but some of the matches fell short of my expectations. That is why i rate this ppv a 4 out of 5. I welcome your comments.

More run of the mill stuff from these guys. It was fun for what it was, but again, this had more of that 'first match in a major program' feel to it as neither guy really uncorked the stuff they're capable of. Nothing overly horrendous or anything but nothing really went anywhere per sae. **1/4

Extreme Rules Match- ECW Championship

Big Show(c) vs Sabu

Take the hundred of so Sabu botches out of the match, it was pretty good. Big Show's been flat out awesome since about late November-early December last year and threw out a fun World title match, taking about nine million bumps. There wasn't a whole hell of a lot to this other than a bunch of table spots and Sabu using all the toys he can to try and put himself on equal footing with the big man. Unfortunately for Sabu, it doesn't work out in his favor. Decent match **1/2

Legend vs Legend Killer

Hulk Hogan vs Randy Orton

Considering Hogan came into this match injured, I'm surprised it was even average. The insanely hot crowd (I was there) helped drag some fun out of an otherwise terrible match. **

""I Quit"" match

Ric Flair vs Mick Foley

This was absolutely fantastic. Flair is still Flair and lends creedence to the 'it's not how much you do, it's how you do it'. Great, fun, intense, and bloody blow off to what I considered the best feud of the year. Hateful Flair is the best. ***3/4

World Heavyweight Championship

King Booker(c) vs Batista

Plain and simple, these two go together like oil and water. A dead crowd, ZERO chemistry and the fact that Batista was working a match he just wasn't ready to work (coming off injury) all added up to a pretty miserable match. The botch at the end was pretty rough as well. *3/4

DX vs McMahons

A lot of fun. It wasn't all that great but it was a lot of fun. A ton of HBK and Triple H essentially kicking the crap out of the McMahons for about 20 minutes. A mega hot crowd made an absolutely simple match pretty enjoyable. **3/4

WWE Championship

Edge(c) vs John Cena

Absolutely solid stuff. These two, at the beginning of the whole program in the winter, didn't really mesh well but over time have learned to work very well with each other. Absolutely enjoyable and the whole not getting DQ'd thing was pretty fun as well as Edge and Lita spend 90% of the match figuring out a way to cheat and keep the title. I really enjoyed the heck out of this. Only their match in December on Raw would surpass this one. ***3/4

Overall: There was only one real stinker on this card. Mysterio-Chavo is sort of just 'there' but everything else was at the very least fun. I wouldn't call this the best Summerslam i've ever seen, but it was a pretty solid offering all things considered. Edge-Cena and Flair-Foley are excellent matches while DX-McMahons, Hogan-Orton and Show-Sabu give us all sorts of fun.",1174003200,,2845,4.468085106382978

Hulk Hogan vs Randy Orton

Now, not being a huge fan of Randy Orton (and this being the first time I've ever seen Hogan perform), my obvious choice was to back the Hulkster.

This was not a horrible match, and the excitement for Hogan was very, very there, but maybe Hulk should have let Randy win this one

2610755,3,B000GG4XXI,"In two years, SummerSlam went from being my favorite PPV of the year to being the most disappointing one.  I mean, outside interfearence in every other match and some matches were just bad to watch.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero - Personally, I never liked the Eddie Guerrero storyline & I never will.  With that aside, it was an alright match but they've had better.  The real highlight for me though was hearing the crowd BOO whenever they would copy Eddie's moves like the Three Amigos suplex.  Then when Vickie came out, they kept putting the camera on her back & forth.  Again, the match was decent & only because them putting over ""fighting for Eddie"" storyling & Vickie Guerrero took away from it.

ECW Championship Big Show vs. Sabu - In a nutshell, I just saw this as Sabu being a spotmoney for Big Show to dominate.  The match wasn't smooth as Sabu is also so fast paced & tryin' to be innovative that his spots look sloppy at times plus some of the props like the tables were having some problems as well.  Just again, Sabu was a body for Show to dominate over.

Randy Orton vs. Hulk Hogan - This match was kept short due to Hogan having a ""bad knee"" but it was as usual Orton selling & bumping around to make Hogan look better than he is.  I'll give this match more credit than usual because Hogan at least sold the RKO finisher from Orton by not kicking out & just having his foot underneath the rope.

""I Quit"" Match: Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley - Seeing Ric Flair take these hardcore spots in his shape & age in the ring is really to see.  This was the best match on the card so far but it got a little weak towards the end with Melina running in.  But still, the match is something to see.

World Heavyweight Champion King Booker vs. Batista - I'm sorry but it just really seemed like Batista was really off in this match & it made it seem just bad.  I mean, it's not horrible but you just expected a better performance between the both of them as Booker can only have a good match if his opposition is good too.

DX vs. The McMahons - I did not like this match PERIOD!  The only thing that entertained me was the crowd not giving DX the pop the Hogan got earlier in the night to the point to where DX was asking for more cheers & even mocked Hogan in the end.  To summerize, DX squashed the Spirit Squad like they did all summer long...then squashed Finlay, Kennedy, and Regal...Big Show comes in, takes out HBK in the ring, and chokeslams HHH through a table outside the ring...The McMahon's then do their best impressions of the Legion Of Doom & Hart Foundation on HBK until HHH comes in for the big save...Umaga comes out & beats up HHH before Kane shows up & they brawl to the back...DX beats the McMahons.  Again, I didn't like it as it was just OVERKILL.

WWE Championship Edge vs. John Cena - Cena put in a strong performance here and Edge's almost comical reactions to Lita trying to help him when he could lose the belt on a DQ added an element of humor to the match.  The ending was a little weak (brass knucks to the BACK of the head), overall, the match saved this event from ending on a bad note.

DVD extras include the two SummerSlam commericals with Kane & Viscera going after the last hot dog at the party and the potato sack race with Shelton & Carlito & Candice.  There's also a recap of what happened the next night on RAW involving Cena, Edge, and the returning Jeff Hardy.

Overall, this PPV just was disappointing to me & I would only recommend for a video rental as only 2-3 matches were worth watching again & again.",1163980800,9,3558,4.290419161676646

Raw is suppose to be the flagship of WWE, but its always the same old stuff every week. DX/McMahons and Edge/Cena. ECW is a shell of its former self, all the rooster is castrated. Its sad to watch the glory days of ECW, then watch is now. The change is astromonical. I saw a house show in July and was very disappointed with the product. Smackdown is the best bet for WWE right now. They have fresh talent and amazing matchs. I haven't recieved Smackdown since it started, but thanks to the CW network, I can watch it now. I saw Smackdown three times last year and every show was a steller production. RAW needs new ideas, ECW is a complete joke and might be gone by December, and Smackdown is the best bet right now. That is my opinon and I know everyone has one.

Big Show VS Sabu: Wow they really treated ECW good. Opening spot on anther subpar edition of Summerslam. I saw these guys wrestle a house show and that was better.

Hulk Hogan VS Randy Orton: I cannot believe Hogan was put over Orton. Hogan had a bum knee but still managed to win it. Orton has gone thru rough times over the past few years but hey he's the world champion now!

Ric Flair VS Mick Foley: A very brutal match between two legends. The only real reason to watch this show. Flair has put on some amazing hardcore matches in the last few years.

King Booker VS Batista: A dud of a match. Two good wrestlers and one bad match.

2610759,4,B000GG4XXI,"Summerslam 2006 had it's fair share of good matches. The Rey/Chavo match, although involving a touchy subject with the late, great Eddie Guerrero, was another high flying well paced match between the two. Mick Foley/Ric Flair put on an expected bloodbath that would make anyone cringe in their final battle of their fued [which in my opinion has been fued of the year so far] And also despite being in John Cena's neck of the woods, the crowd in Boston had some harsh words for Cena, but that didn't stop him and Edge putting on an okay main event.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero:

High flying shown at it's best. This reminded me of their matches in the first half of 2004 when they were fighting for the Crusierweight title. Vickie Guerrero comes at ringside and, ""accidentally"" knocks Rey off the top rope which allows Chavo to hit a brainbuster and then get the win with the Frog Splash. 8/10 [nice match but they really need to let Eddie rest in peace instead of being put in storyline after storyline.]

ECW World Heavyweight Championship

Extreme Rules Match

The Big Show [Champion] vs. Sabu:

This whole ECW thing with, ""Extreme Rules Matches"" is just plain stupid, but it was still an okay match. Sabu uses a lot of chairs, which was expected, and more than a few tables were used.  One spot saw Sabu send Big Show through a table that was set up in one of the corners of the ring. The Big Show put the steel steps into the ring and bridged them with another table. Sabu then gave a DDT to Big Show through the same table! In the end Sabu got yet another table but Big Show caught him in midair after jumping and chokeslammed him through the table for the win. 8.5/10 [A few botched spots by Sabu but this is still a very good match.]

Hulk Hogan vs. Randy Orton:

THANK GOD this was not the main event. Hogan was ""injured"" so he was even slower than ususal, if you can imagine that for a second. Randy Orton should be in the title picture but instead just becomes another stat in Hulk's long winning streak just because he's afraid [even now] of losing his top spot. Orton at one point looked like he had won but the ref reversed the decision because Hulk's foot was on the bottom rope. Skip this match, nothing special and Hogan wins with the predictable leg drop. 5/10

I Quit Match

Rick Flair vs. Mick Foley:

This is what you don't want to see if you hate the sight of blood. A LOT of barbed wire was in this one and both men bleed like damn rivers were gushing out of their forheads. At one point Flair chopped Foley in the chest with Mr. Socko wrapped in barbed wire on his hand. Foley then threw open a bag of tacks and gave a scoop slam to Flair onto them. Both men refused to quit after taking tremendous beatings from each other. At the end Melina tried to quit for Foley but Flair wouldn't let her and was about to hit Melina with the bat when Foley said, ""I Quit,"" to protect Melina. 9.5/10 [This was a lot shorter than I thought it would be, but the punishment these two do to each other is enough to earn my respect once again for these men.]

World Heavyweight Championshp

Booker T [Champion] vs. Batista:

This was a waste of time. Halfway through the match [the short match that is] Sharmell runs in and causes Booker T to get disqualified. The fans boo the hell out of the finish and I don't blame them. After the match Batista beats up Booker but messes up the Batista Bomb which the fans boo again. 4/10

Vince and Shane McMahon vs. Degeneration X:

This was actually a pretty good match. At Unforgiven inside Hell in a Cell should be the end of this fued, but this was a good stepping stone in their fued. Before the match even started Vince  sent out The Spirit Squad, Fit Finlay, William Regal, Ken Kennedy, and finally the Big Show to take out DX. Big Show even chokeslammed HHH through the announce table.

The match began and The McMahons tried everything in their power to pin HBK. HHH recovers and then Umaga comes out to attack DX. Kane then makes an appearance and fights Umaga. In the end Shawn Michales hit Sweet Chin Music to Shane McMahon in midair in an impressive spot and HHH hit Vince with a trashcan and got the win. 9/10

WWE Championship

Edge [Champion] vs. John Cena:

People booed Cena even though it was near his hometown. During the match Lita threw a steel chair in the ring but Edge didn't want her to hit Cena because the title would change hands on a DQ. A lot of back and forth action and near the end Lita gave Edge some brass knucks and Edge nailed Cena with them to win and keep the title. 8.5/10

Summerslam 2006 was good for the Rey/Chavo match, The I Quit Match [which was really brutal] DX/McMahon match was entertaining to see, and the WWE Title match was okay to see. This Summerslam was a good ppv event. This is recommended.",1157068800,10,4801,4.363636363636363

1. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero- This was a nice way to kick off the show. ALot of people thought that this was not going to be a good match but i liked it. Lots of fast paced action right from the get go. Also lots of high risk moves. The paret i did not lkike was when vickie guerrero got involved. Nice choice as opener and a surprising ending. WInner CHavo Guerrero. Match Rating 7/10.

2. Big SHow vs. Sabu for the ecw title in a extreme rules match- Nice place for this on the card. These 2 realy worked well together. There were a few bothced moves in this match but it did not hurt it to much. There was non stop action from the begining with some sick chair shots and tons of table action including a sick ddt through the table. It was finished with a runnig chockslam through a table. WInner and still ecw champ hte big show. Match Rating 7.5/10.

3. Hulk Hogan vs. Randy Orton- This was a up and down match. I was not looking as foward to this match as i was to the one with michales last year. It was okay and about 10 minutes in lenght. Alot of this match was controlled by orton and the only problem was hogan hit one move and one it was wierd but not a horriable. WInner Hulk Hogan. Match Rating 6/10.

4. Mick Foley vs. Rick Flair in a i quit match- This match was absolutly brutal is the only way u can describe it. The only complant i would have about the match is i wish it could have been a little longer. Besides that u had everthing from barb wire to thumbtacks to barb wire bats to chairs. Awsome math and hope they could do something like thi sagin this year, Winner Rick Flair. Match Rating 9/10.

5. King Booker vs. Batistia for the WHT- This was a preaty soild match except for the dumb ending. SOild 12 minutes of wrestling aciton i wiush the ending would have been different seeing this was smackdows main event. Booker and batitia looked really good and worked well together. Proboly a rematch that will be schedual to come up. WInner by dq Batistia. match Rating 6/10.

6. Dx vs. The McMahons- I was surprised that this was not made into a no dq match or something but than i saw the begining and i saw why they made it a regualr tag. Interesting way to start offf the show with everyone coming out to protect the mcmahons. SIck Spot in the begining were hhh gets chockslammed through the announce table. Then most of the match was just back and forth tag but when hhh got the tag the match really picked up. Umaga came down to help the mcmhons but than kane came and took him out. A nice trash can shot and a sick swet chin music in mid air deliverd to shane. WInners DX. Match Rating 8/10.

7. Edge vs. John Cena for the wwe title- This was a awosme way to close out the show. The crowd reaction was great as there were people that were accualty booing cena in his homeotwn. Lots of the match was controlled by edge but cena fought back and the last few minutes of the  match i was on the dge of my seet. Nice to see that cena did nto win agian and they accualty let edge keep the title. WInner and still wwe champ edge. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give summerslam 2006 a grade of 52/70 which is a 74% which means this is a awsome ppv. I woul drecomedn that u get this when it comes out a very good ppv.

2610761,4,B000GG4XXI,"In their best PPV outing thus far this year the WWE created a filler free card with three matches that were well above average. There were surprises (though no huge ones) and the matches themselves were solid throughout. Yes, we did have to endure another Hulk Hogan match, and they even let him win, which to me is a crime against humanity. Other than that my complaints are few and far between.

The under-card contained two very good matches. The first being Big Show vs. Sabu for the ECW title. I know there were a few missed spots, but I'm going to forgive them because this was a blast to watch. The mixing of Sabu with Big Show is just as interesting as watching Big Show mix with ECW style matches. He's not the ideal opponent for Sabu, but he is a unique one. Just a few years back, when the WWF had to actually compete with ECW, these matches common at every event. Sabu's misery is our pleasure, and I gleaned a lot from this match. Then there is also the ""I Quit"" match between Mick Foley and Ric Flair. Now here are two wrestlers whose bodies are well past their prime. But their name value and will to compete still thrive. In true hardcore fashion the match makes you cringe and want to look away. And I don't want to hear about how it's all fake either, because we should all be sophisticated enough by now to know that wrestling is predetermined not fake. Of course I am aware that this is no Japanese Death Match, but for WWE in 2006 this is as hardcore as you're going to get. The ending did stick to the ""I Quit"" formula, because Vince can't bear to have one of his wrestlers look weak. His wrestlers are noble, not weak.

Finally, we come to the top of the card. I will skip right over King Booker vs. Batista, only to say that they seemed to be having communication problems, and that the ending was unexpected and brutally disappointing. The showstopper, however, was the DX vs. The McMahon's match. The match of the night proved very successful in a very new school type of booking. It showed that you can have a very good, entertaining match without a whole lot of wrestling. When Vince Russo was preaching more drama less wrestling, this is what he had in mind. It told a story in which caricatures (egotistical boss, uppity employees, brownnosers) all filled their roles, and the twists kept the audience guessing. Vince McMahon should be applauded again for making a fortune by lampooning his own type, greedy maniacal bosses. Nobody really thinks their boss is going to start a Kiss My A** club, but we all believe that secretly nothing would please our bosses more. Plus the homage to Demolition and the Legion of Doom is one of the few ways old time wrestling fans (like me) are paid back for years of loyalty. Lastly, we have Edge vs. John Cena in what was a perfectly fine match. Everything goes by the book, but at least Cena seemed to care tonight. In the end the right guy won, in the right way, even though that surprised me. Just please answer me one question, why did Tazz and Joey Styles even show up? ***3/4",1156291200,5,3048,4.431372549019608
2610762,5,B000GG4XXI,"Chavo vs Rey Mysterio jr.: A lot of action but it would've been better if Vickie Guerrero didn't come out and tell them to stop fighting. They don't listen of course but still it was distracting in another wise great match. I would've liked to have seen Chavo win without her accidenty knocking Rey off the top rope. Chavo then nails the brainbuster and then the frog splash for the win.

8/10

  Sabu vs The Big Show (ECW title): I figured Sabu would lose and then Cena and Batista would win their world title matches. That surprisingly didn't happen eventhough Sabu still lost this one. I wish he won though. Sure Big Show's ECW matches are surprisingly entertaining but Sabu deserved to win this one. They both take some bumps, especially Sabu of course. Sabu goes to put Big Show through a table with an airial move and Show catches him and choke slams him through the table for the win.

7/10

  Randy Orton vs Hogan: Orton probably should've won this one. Plus I thought this was all about Orton wanting Brooke yet she doesn't make even one appearance during the match. So this was yet another big match for Hogan to win and then just disapear again afterwards. Orton hit the RKO and pinned Hogan but Hogan's foot was on the rope during the 3 count. So the match is restarted after the ref notices the foot on the rope. While Orton argues with the ref, Hogan gets up and Hulks up then quickle nails the big boot and Orton as to sell it  by laying down like 15 seconds or more as Hogan asks the fans if they want the leg drop.

  7 out of 10

  Mick Foley vs Ric Flair (I Quit): This one is all bleedning and pain and no wrestling. Both men beat the crap out of each other but Flair owns the last half of the match. The ref trys to stop the match after Flair hurts Foley bad but Flair won't let the match end. Melina then throws in the towel and Flair still won't let the match end. Flair then threatens to hit Melina with a barbed wire bat and then Foley Quits. Not bad but like the Rey match it would've been better if it had no woman involvement.

8/10

  Booker vs Batista: The weaker match of the night. When Beniot comes back they should just give him the belt whether Batista is better on the mic or not. Beniot still has better matches with Booker and...better matches period! Plus Booker is better when he's not...King Booker. If only the WWE actually gave him the belt when he was actually over with the fans. Plus Batista just looked weak here. After Sharmel caused the DQ by jumping on his back he barely even could do the Batista bomb on Booker. Yet I'm sure he will still get the belt from Booker even if he isn't champ material right now. Just like Cena will still get the belt from Edge.

5/10

  DX vs The McMahons: Umaga, Regal, Big Show, The Spirit Squard, Finlay and Kennedy attack DX with Umaga and Show hurting them the most. Kane comes out and gets rid of Umaga although I'm sure Kane will be the next to get beat with that from the butt straight to the throat thumb move that Umaga does. When the match starts Shawn gets beat up by the McMahons for awhile before HHH gets tagged in. End comes when Shane teases doing a Van Terminator on HHH, Shawn superkicked hims though. HHH hit Vince with a garbage can, Shawn used a superkick and HHH pinned Vince after a pedigree.

8/10

  Cena vs Edge (World title): Cena had the match won a few times and the end comes when Edge hits Cena with brassknucks. Surprisingly not the end that I expected but I'm sure since Edge won he haven't seen the last of Cena vs Edge. Cena will still most likely win the belt from him. That is if HHH doesn't decide to push himself as champ as a face this time and take the belt from Edge. Still I doubt Cena will just be pushed in the back.

8/10

  In all it was a good ppv with an almost solid card despite the Batista match being weak. It's one of the better WWE ppvs in awhile anyway.",1156032000,3,3891,4.253061224489796

8131881,3,B000GG4XXI,"This was a sad ppv to be in the pretty exciting year of 2006, but had some nice matches.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero
This was a nice opener to a dissapointing ppv. This was practically a cruiserweight match and did have some nice highflying action. These two always have pretty good matches, and this feud continued all the way to no mercy where these two met up in a falls count anywhere, but these two put on a nice match. 3/5

Extreme Rules match for the ECW championship
Big Show vs. Sabu
Well, that tuesday before the ppv, Sabu defeated RVD in a ladder match for the number one contendership to the title. These two, minus the height advantage, these two made a pretty good match. This was the time of ECW becoming a part of the WWE, and they pushed them nicely. This match had chairs, broken tables, and pretty nice action. There were three huge table spots in this match that i enjoyed very well. But Show did pull off a good win. 3.5/5

Hulk Hogan vs. Randy Orton
What i have to say about this match is that it is ten freaking minuets of slow, boring, out of place action. This had a nice build up leading to the match but was just a load of crap once these two faced here. Im sorry to all Hogan fans, but he sucks here. 1/5

I Quit match
Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley
This was the most hardcore match on the card. Because of the stipulation, i had a nice feeling how this would turn out. These men practically beatthe living crap out of each other and was just bloodied at the end. There was barbed wire boards, barbed wire bats, tacs, and much more. This match was slow at times, but lived up to expectations. 3.75/5

World Heavyweight championship
Booker T vs. Batista
This match was another cluncker. This match really stunk easpecially at the end when Booker got himself disqualified. This match had no spark, and was just a waste of 13 minuets. This match had some moments, but they just wern't good enough to save this match. This was the down side of the two last matches of the ppv. 2/5

WWE championship
Edge vs. John Cena
This was the worst encounter between these two superstars. This match didn't even exceed the sixteen minuet mark. This was sthe longest match of the night and it was only fifteen minuets. But the action was pretty good, its just this match could have been a whole lot better. this match was a waste after the shot to the back of the head from Edge with brass knucks. The crowd was really dissapointed, but this was a perfect storyline to put up fot the unforgiven TLC match between these two. Watchable, but very screwy. 3.5/5

Sadly, this ppv was a waste for the biggest event of the summer, and no match on my review made it to either four stars, or higher. So, i don't really recommend it. But thanks for reading and please rate!",1279152000,2,2773,4.352030947775629

The worst matches were the Chavo Guerrero-Rey Mysterio match which was a mess like SuperMan 3 and the crowd hated it so much that VKM was probably going to push the angle for another 6 months,The Hulk Hogan-Randy Orton match & its angle leading up to that match was a total mess like The Gargabe Pail Kids Movie but the Boston crowd still loved it & was still alive thoughtout the match and last but not least...The ECW Championship match between Sabu & The Big Show in which Sabu messed up many times eventhough the crowd in Boston were 6 millions times more into that match than they were for the opener. The World's Championship match between King Booker & Batista was a feel nothing match and belive me I felt nothing. The WWE Championship between John Cena & Edge was a good soild match. I give this event a 6 out of 10.",1277164800,,1011,4.298429319371728
8131883,3,B000GG4XXI,"I seriously don't understand what happened to the Summerslam PPV in recent years. It used to be a fantastic show, but lately there's been some very average shows, including this one, the 2006 edition.

I just watched this PPV and found it to be very mediocre.

Here's a rundown:

Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero

This opening match served to get the crowd hyped up and it did that. Other then that, it was a decidedly average match. I think Chavo and Rey have had better together, and the ending of the match was ruined by Vickie Guerrero coming to ringside. I could have done without her appearance. The wrestling on display was good, but the ending was weak. Not a terrible match, but not fantastic either. (3/5)

ECW World Championship Match
Big Show (champion) vs Sabu

This match was ECW's first appearance at a WWE PPV since the brand was reestablished, and it wasn't good. This match was FULL of botches - I know Sabu is a hardcore wrestler and isn't a technical guy, but the whole match was a mess. There was a couple of good spots though, but overall this was a disaster. I'll give it a 2 cos of the couple of good spots. (2/5)

""Legend vs Legend Killer"" match
Hulk Hogan vs Randy Orton

For the second Summerslam in a row, Hogan is in a match. Unfortunately, this match isn't a patch on his match with Shawn Michaels from the 05 Summerslam. This match lasted 10 minutes and most of that was just a waste of time, if you ask me. I'm not Hogan or Orton's biggest fan to be honest, and I found this kind of boring, mainly because Hogan acted like how he always does and won the match (that's not a spoiler as everybody knew it would happen anyway). The bright spot of the match for me was actually Orton RKOing Hulk and the referee almost missing Hogan's leg on the ropes. Otherwise, this was not a good match. (2/5)

""I Quit"" match
Ric Flair vs Mick Foley

This was one of the better matches on the card. It wasn't really a wrestling match at all though, it was mostly brawling with weapon use. Both Flair and Foley bled absolute buckets and there was some sick spots including barbed wire and thumbtacks. The ending was weak though with Melina getting involved. But this was a major improvement over the previous match. (3.5/5)

World Heavyweight Championship match
King Booker (champion) (w/ Queen Sharmell) vs Batista

I swear Batista cannot get a decent Summerslam match (his only decent one recently was with John Cena in 2008), as yet again he's involved in a lacklustre match with King Booker, that AGAIN ends in a DQ (his match in 2005 ended in DQ also as did his 07 match!). The wrestling displayed was fine, but the match was just mediocre. During Booker's headlocks, the crowd chanted ""boring!"" and I agree with them, it was dull. Yet again, another bad match for the Animal at Summerslam. (2/5)

D-Generation X (Triple H & Shawn Michaels) vs Mr. McMahon & Shane McMahon

This was another huge mess of a match. I love DX, I really do, but this definitely isn't one of their best outings. It's mainly because the match didn't get started until after Vince and Shane sent out the Spirit Squad, Finlay, Mr Kennedy, William Regal AND Big Show to take out DX. Amusingly, the Spirit Squad lasted about 10 seconds, but the other four guys did the job. Triple H went through the ECW announce table and Big Show took out Shawn. The match FINALLY began and Vince and Shane just beat up Shawn for about ten minutes, doing their best impressions of Demolition and the Hart Foundation, until Triple H got back in it and DX took over the match. A good outcome with DX picking up the win, but this match was messy and Vince and Shane dominated for WAY too long. I gave it 3 though cos JR is absolutely hilarious on commentary during this match. (3/5)

WWE Championship Match
Edge (champion) (w/ Lita) vs John Cena

This match was contested in John's hometown. Everybody is saying John was booed more then Edge, but John had lots of fans IMO and when John had Edge in the STFU, the crowd were going insane for Edge to tap out. Anyway, this match was probably the best of the whole night. The stipulation was that if Edge got DQed, he'd lose the title. Lita tried to help Edge cheat - she threw him a chair and Edge freaked out on her, it was really funny. Some great wrestling was displayed from both men, until the end when John had the STFU on and Lita put brass knuckles on Edge's hand. What I don't get is, when Lita leapt on top of John and Edge, WHY didn't the ref DQ Edge?! The ending was bad, but the rest of the match was good, so it gets the best rating. (4/5)

The DVD extras were good, there's four.

The first two were little promo videos for Summerslam. The superstars were having a huge party (as Summerslam is ""the biggest party of the summer"") and different things were happening. The first video showed DX barbequing and there's only one sausage left - Kane and Viscera both spot it and try to get there before each other. Funny things ensue as Kane knocks over the Spirit Squad and Viscera smacks into Chris Masters. Unfortunately for them, Coach sees the sausage and eats it, and just as he does, Kane and Viscera walk up and glare at him, it's funny. The other is a sack race between Shelton Benjamin, Carlito and Candice Michelle. Shelton & Carlito jump off but Candice decides to act all sexy to win. Carlito stops and stares at her xD It's funny also and Candice looks absolutely stunning.

The third was the making of the Summerslam promos - you hear from the superstars and see how the above videos were made. The ending cracked me up with Shawn Michaels and a very long sausage xD

The last is a video package outlining what happened on Raw the night after Summerslam. This whole package was edited bizarrely if you ask me. It starts with Edge coming out to the ring and telling everybody he'd win at Summerslam, then cuts to Lita at the waterfront - where she throws John Cena's spinner belt into the water. Edge then debuts his Rated R spinner belt, and challenges anybody in the back to beat him. The returning Jeff Hardy comes out and challenges him. Next we see highlights from their match, and it's weird cos they play this music in the background while all the while JR and King keep doing commentary, I was like huh? for the whole thing. The match ends in a DQ when John Cena comes out and begins brawling with Edge. They brawl right out of the arena and to the waterfront where they throw each other into things. It ends with John throwing Edge into the water xD The last few seconds of the video show Edge being helped out of the water and onto a boat.

Overall, a VERY average Summerslam. The main event, DX vs McMahons and Foley vs Flair matches were probably the best this show had to offer.

I don't really recommend this show, unless you're collecting PPVs (like me, I'm collecting every PPV released, I have 105 right now). Rent it if you really want to see it. 3 stars.",1273017600,,6915,4.428346456692913
8131884,2,B000GG4XXI,"Summer Slam had some decent matches but really nothing that will be remembered maybe except for the I Quit Match but other than that not a lot of good matches or segments at all. I do feel this Summer Slam was a tad better than Summer Slam 2007.

1. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guererro
I really did enjoy watching this match but I personally didn't like the whole Eddie storyline. I believe this match would have been a whole lot better if it wasn't centered around him. Some nice high risk and some good brawling as well, I was a little shocked by the brawling between Rey & Chavo. The ending & interference defiantly hurt this one a lot but like I said I felt it would have been a better match if it wasn't based on Eddie. Nice opener. 3.5/5

2. Ecw World Championship
Big Show vs. Sabu- Extreme Rules
Pretty good match. Big Show took some hard head shots from Sabu in this one with the chair. Some nice table spots as well. Sabu also takes a brutal Vader bamb from the Big Show in this one. Pretty strong match from Ecw right here. Good match. 3.5/5

3. Randy Orton vs. Hulk Hogan
You knew this was just a matter of time that this was going to go down between probably the ultimate Legend and the Legend Killer. The match wasn't horrible at all but it did went down hill a few times during the match. Orton works on Hogan's leg for the better part of the duration of the match. It was a little short though but it wasn't all that bad of a
match. 3/5

4. ""I Quit"" Match
Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley
Pretty good match but I was shocked that Flair was going to go this violent but he did. There were some viscious shots with the barb wire in this one, Flair even knifehead chops Foley with the barb wire around his hand which was cool to see. Very bloody too in this one. I enjoyed this one as well but the ending defiantly took away from this one, I felt this match needed a cleaner ending then the way it did ended but good match nevertheless. 4/5

5. World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs. King Booker w/ Sharmell
This match had bad written all over it and especially because of Booker's stupid a55 king gimmick he was doing during the time period. I didn't really enjoyed nothing from this match, I really hated this match. Nothing good I have to say about this one. The DQ at the end really made the match worst than it already was. Poor championship match. 1.5/5

6. D-Generation X vs. Mr. McMahon & Shane McMahon
I found this match more amusing than of anything. I really enjoyed how The McMahons took out Triple H with the announce table before Vince would officially start the match. The McMahons had the advantage for the most part of the match. I also liked how the McMahons was pulling off these legendary tag moves, I really got a kick out of that. More of a handicap match in the beginning but it turned out to be a better match later on down the road, I really liked this tag match but it was soon overshadowed thanks to their Hell in the Cell match at Unforgiven. 4/5

7. WWE Championship
Edge w/ Lita vs. John Cena
The match had a stupid stipulation cause if Edge got DQed on purpose than he would loose the title to Cena. The match did get kind of stupid when Lita was trying to give weapons to Edge for him to try to use them, I just found that part totally ridiculous. I'm very glad their TLC match made up for their horrible matches throughout the year. Another poor title match, least I thought it was. 2.5/5

Summer Slam wasn't all that good but I do felt it was better than 07's. I wouldn't recommend on getting this one, yall should invest in getting Unforgiven 06 before this one. Not a very good ppv to say the least.",1217462400,2,3640,4.257597684515195
8131885,4,B000GG4XXI,"1) CHAVO GUERRERO VS. REY MYSYERIO
THESE MEN COULD HAVE PUT ON A LOT BETTER MATCH TOGETHER IF THEY HAD MORE TIME.  BUT, ITS A SOLID OPENER.  VICKY GUERRERO'S INTERFERENCE KIND OF RUINS IT THOUGH.  WINNER: CHAVO GUERRERO 6/10

2) SABU VS. BIG SHOW (ECW WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP)
THIS MATCH WAS PRETTY AWESOME.  THERE IS TONS OF TABLES IN THIS MATCH.  OF COURSE BIG SHOW WHENS THOUGH WITH A CHOKE SLAM THROUGH A TABLE. WINNER: BIG SHOW 8/10

3) RANDY ORTON VS. HULK HOGAN (LEGEND VS. LEGEND KILLER)
THIS MATCH WAS VERY DISSAPOINTING.  I EXPECTED A MATCH KING OF LIKE 2005'S SUMMERSLAM WITH HBK VS. HOGAN BUT THAT DIDNT HAPPEN.  AND, I THINK ITS RIDICULOUS WHEN THE REF RESTARTS THE MATCH.  ORTON SHOULDVE WON TIHS MATCH BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE DIDNT. WINNER: HULK HOGAN 7/10

4) MICK FOLEY VS. RIC FLAIR (I QUIT MATCH)
THIS WAS PROBABLY THE WORST I QUIT MATCH IVE EVER SEEN.  EXSPECIALLY WITH TWO LEGENDS IN THE MATCH.  WELL THERES NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS MATCH EXCEPT MELINA INTERFERES IN THE END AND FOLEY QUITS. WINNER: RIC FLAIR 7/10

5) KING BOOKER VS. BATISTA (WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP)
THIS WAS ALSO A DISSAPOINTING MATCH.  BATISTA SHOULDVE WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP RIGHT HERE BUT SHARMELL INTERFERES AND IT ENDS IN A DQ.  WINNER: BATISTA (DQ) 7/10

6) DX VS. THE MCMAHONS
WELL FIRST THE MCMAHONS HAVE SOME PEOPLE COME IN AND HELP BUT THE ONLY ONES THAT REALLY MATTER ARE UMAGA AND BIG SHOW.  THEY BEAT UP DX FOR A WHILE BUT THEN KANE COMES OUT AND BEATS UP UMAGA.  THEN AFTER ALL THIS THE MATCH STARTS.  DX GETS BEAT FOR A WHILE BY THE MCMAHONS BUT THEN SHANE TRYS TO GO POST TO POST WITH A DROP KICK BUT GETS SOME SWEET CHIN MUSIC IN MID AIR! AFTER THAT VINCE COMES IN THE RING AND GETS HIT WITH A SWEET CHIN MUSIC FOLLOWED BY A PEDIGREE FOR THE WIN.  WINNERS: DX 9/10

7) JOHN CENA VS. EDGE (WWE CHAMPIONSHIP)
THIS MATCH TO ME WAS NOT THAT GOOD FOR A MAIN EVENT.  THE MCMAHONS VS. DX MATCH WAS A LOT BETTER AND SHOULDVE BEEN MAIN EVENT.  BUT EDGE WINS AFTER HE HITS CENA WITH BRASS KNUCKLES.  WINNER: EDGE 8/10",1183766400,,2014,4.392953929539296
