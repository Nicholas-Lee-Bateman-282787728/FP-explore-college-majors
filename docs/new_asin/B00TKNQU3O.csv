7012578,4,B00TKNQU3O,A superficial but good documentary about Ronaldo's life. It covers the main aspects of his personal and professional life with no much details. He is a great player who is an inspiration to young generations,1438214400,,207,4.942857142857143
7012579,3,B00TKNQU3O,I am a huge fan of Cristiano Ronaldo I was hoping to learn more about him from this documentary basically it tells you pretty much the basic things you already know and at times its focus is only off cristiano and talks about other former football players and other gossip like Cristiano being linked to Paris Hilton it was okay I wish would have like interviews from Cristiano and maybe his family members it's not boring nor is it exciting either I rather wait for official documentary Ronaldo coming this Fall I'm sure it will be far better.,1434412800,5,544,4.561224489795919

7012583,2,B00TKNQU3O,"The script was disappointingly repetitive, as were the visuals.  You can get a great deal more of Ronaldo's brilliant footwork on You Tube.  That being said, the documentary did touch on aspects of his life I was unaware of, such as how poor he was growing up and his support of charities, and kindness to children.  That was nice.",1471824000,,331,4.576271186440678

7012618,4,B00TKNQU3O,Interesting and informative.  I have more respect for Mr. Ronaldo than I did before seeing this.  He isn't just a pretty face that can play soccer.,1459209600,,147,4.615384615384615
7012619,1,B00TKNQU3O,"Goes back and forth in time without any understandable reason.
Jumping from one story to another with no transition.",1459036800,,116,5.157894736842105

7012623,2,B00TKNQU3O,"I love CR7 since 2005, but I expected more of this movie. As a long time fan, I would have like to see more of his hard training sessions, the feelings he had during the world cups with more details, more details about how he handle frustration and the feeling of despair and failure. I would have like this movie to be more of an inspiration to kids playing soccer than just info about Cristiano. Sorry babe.",1454544000,,409,4.324675324675325
7012624,4,B00TKNQU3O,I honestly expected a little more out of this movie. Overall it was pretty good. It gives you a little inside of what he goes through on a daily basis.,1453680000,,151,4.066666666666666
7012625,3,B00TKNQU3O,"Thought this was the new movie but it isn't. Like others have mentioned, it's a vanity fluff story. Stuff I already knew being a fan. Hope the new movie will reveal more.",1449014400,,170,4.34375

7012635,2,B00TKNQU3O,"I wanted to love this movie, but it was just ok. Part of Cristiano's appeal for me is his ego, but this movie showed a bit too much ego. There's a part about Messi and Ronaldo's rivalry and it was just totally unnecessary. Basically comparing their looks, who's better looking. That was a big turn off. But it was nice to see Ronaldo the philanthropist. The movie gave me almost a propaganda feeling....",1447286400,2,403,4.534246575342466

7012637,1,B00TKNQU3O,"Documentary would be categorically wrong. All this film does is say how great Ronaldo is. He is so humble. He is so extravagant...but also humble. He is such a great player.

8702137,3,B00TKNQU3O,It didn't focus entirely on him which is what is what I expected.  Furthermore they took shots of slums in India and other third world nations rather than real shots of his neighborhood to exaggerate his poor upbringing in Portugal.,1484697600,,232,4.8
8702138,4,B00TKNQU3O,Good biographical film,1484092800,,22,6.666666666666667
8702139,5,B00TKNQU3O,"This was the Ronaldo so few people know about.

The show was insightful and very broad giving us more than just a birds eye view into the life of one of football's greatest player of his generation. It features not only his rise from the streets of his hometown in Portugal to the master he is at Real Madrid, but also into his private family life and the things he endured including watching his mother battle with cancer.

This one is a definite recommend.",1484092800,,458,4.440476190476191
