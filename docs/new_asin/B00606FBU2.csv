4911824,5,B00606FBU2,"I am also a David Tennant fan from the US, and was so excited to see The Decoy Bride available here on Amazon.  It was a really cute movie that was a bit quirky at times, laugh at loud funny (at least I did), and enjoyable to watch.  David was (as usual) fantastic and Kelly MacDonald was lovely to watch as well.  The island was a gorgeous backdrop for the story too.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys chick flickish movies, and/or is a David Tennant fan:)",1328572800,20,464,4.238636363636363
4911825,5,B00606FBU2,"I've just watched this movie one and three-fourths times in a row (all D.T. scenes), and then I went back and watched my favorite scenes again, twice. I jumped on the opportunity to see this movie in the US since I'm a die-hard David Tennant fan, and where do we get this much screen time with him lately? This was even better than I expected, and I'd recommend it as a good romp to anyone, fan of David Tennant or no. Best ten bucks ever spent! Enjoy!",1328313600,58,452,4.206896551724138

4911835,4,B00606FBU2,"The Decoy Bride was a rollicking flick starring a (possibly) young David Tenant and a lovely brunette girl who bears a weird resemblance to my sister. The plot contains as many decoys as its title (one?) and is as serpentine as the hedgehog-strewn paths of Hegg island, but if you can stick it out, it has a lot to offer. If nothing else, it was refreshingly unpredictable. Questions we were left with after the film (spoilers, Martha! Below!):

1. Would Lara really have pushed the mom off the cliff if it came down to it? This would have been a dark turn, but we can see it. Despite being desired by the majority of the male populace, Lara is a little unhinged. She just wants to have a good time and a good wedding!!
2. Why were the hedgehogs important?
3. Hedgehogs were such a prominent theme throughout the movie that when Katie asks James about the quills on his boxers, I immediately assumed that he had made love to a hedgehog. They literally could have picked any other animal or any other boxer pattern. This was intentionally confusing.
4. Why is Katie still single if literally everyone who meets her falls in love with her? Even the elderly old man (laird???) who owns the castle and sponsors the pet rock ladies wants to get hot and heavy.
6. If Katie lives in a Bed 'n Breakfast, a place literally chock full of rooms for people to change in, why did she invite David Tenant to get undressed with her in the kitchen with only a quilt in between them? She would have a room to change in because she literally lives there. She would also have clothes to change into for this reason. They did not have to be in towels for that long.
7. Was the bathroom actually haunted? What happened to the agents? The last we see of them, they are cowering in fright as a specter apparently breathes in their vicinity. What happens with this whole plot line? Are they killed? Are they possessed? If so, do they continue to live their lives in much the same way? What does a ghost cow DO when taking over a human body? Also, what is the nature of their relationship? The two agents, not the agents and the ghost cow. That was all strictly platonic.

Anyway, we enjoyed the movie. Four out of five stars, for unanswered questions.",1501718400,,2227,4.429268292682927

What I liked best about it was that while there was a bit of bickering between different characters, nowhere did the movie seem mean spirited. That might sound odd, but there were times when characters could have been mean, but weren't. I liked that!

However, being bored, I stuck with it, and was soon enchanted with  Kelly Macdonald (Katie). Her portrayal of her character was funny, a bit quirky, and completely believable and I found myself rooting for her immediately (as you're supposed to I guess).  David's character (James) is unfortunately an arse for the first half of the movie, but he eventually redeems himself as he slowly falls for Katie.  Decoy Bride was light and funny, silly and a little bit stupid in some parts, but overall a good, enjoyable movie.

4911907,4,B00606FBU2,"I have read all of the negative reviews and am left scratching my head.  Did they all watch the same movie I did?  It seems that one of the recurring themes is that the reviewers often were David Tennant fans and big Dr. Who junkies who were expecting.........Dr. Who in a rom-com?  I on the other hand, didn't even really know who David Tennant was, and have not really been enthusiastic about Dr. Who.  I really liked this movie and so much so, that it's one of the few movies that I would watch over again (along with The Hunt for Red October, The Godfather series, Nacho Libre, Ratatouille, Romantics Anonymous, Home Alone, The Princess Bride, Saints & Soldiers, The Temple of Doom, The School of Rock, Star Wars IV, and some others).  Another recurring theme was that the script was predictable, boring, and formulaic.  Well, it's a rom-com and I thought it was interesting and kind of different, as I've never seen a movie quite like this.  I mean, if you can't stay awake after the first 15 minutes, then perhaps you need a movie that starts right off with some explosions and naked people and stuff like that to keep your attention.  Or, if it's not cerebral enough for you, then I guess you can watch Jane Austen adaptations (which I do like, btw).  Too formulaic for you?  Try watching Eraserhead or something like that.  This movie, however,  is down to earth, very cute, fun, and certainly quirky.  Something I liked about this movie was that the character who was the famous movie star was NOT made out to be a bad person, which is usually the formula when there is a man with a woman and the nicer woman wins him because the first woman is such a shrew.  The part about the Paparazzo was great, btw, especially how it ends, which is surprising.  And finally, one negative comment in an otherwise somewhat positive review was that there wasn't enough sexual content.  Ummm.......don't we have that in just about any other of thousands of movies?  I liked that this movie didn't resort to that and the one time it did (the scene where thery're getting out of their wet clothes) was kind of contrived to me and although well done, wasn't really necessary.  A Rom-Com doesn't ALWAYS have to be a Sex-Com, which is what a lot of movies are, but this PG movie isn't, and THAT is not predictable or formulaic these days.  I give this movie 4 stars because I can watch it again and again, unlike most movies).",1433289600,,2415,4.523041474654378

I've seen it several times now, and each time it makes me laugh, makes me tear up.  Maybe it's the accents (I'm a sucker for a British or Scottish accent).  Maybe it's the playful writing or absurd plotline.  Either way, it gets to me.  I can't help it.",1431648000,,408,4.153846153846154

It's an adorable, utterly charming piece of fluff with lots of funny lines and situations. A terrific date movie or family movie.  And, although many of the stars, including the British Alice Eve, speak with an American accent, how can you not love Kelly McDonald's Scottish brogue?

All three leads are great but even Michael Urie's character, who is given the thankless task of converting an overgrown, musty castle into a bridal bower, is delightfully snarky.  And, yes, as others have said, it's SO nice that the ""other"" woman - the American movie star - is actually quite nice.

I've read the reviews and trust me the movie is getting better press on Amazon than IMDB and other places.  Here's what I say... Fall in love with it's simplicity!  The movie offers a repartee that is quite witty and playful.  Enjoy the ridiculous characters that only seem to make the movie that much funnier.  Give the movie a chance to put a smile on your face, make you giggle, or even laugh out loud!  I've watched it a total of 4 times now and each time I've found myself at the very least smiling even though i already know what is about to happen.  The only real thing that will impede upon your ability to enjoy this movie is if you can't simply watch a movie for what a movie was meant to do - ENTERTAIN!  I'm surprised at all the disparaging reviews as if the movie was written and produced solely to win awards or to become a box office sensation.

They turned what should have been an absolutely awful movie into a cute, despite its flaws, romantic comedy that I actually enjoyed watching.

Honestly, I wanted to like this, but it was rather dull and I kept waiting for it to get better, be more clever, have something emotionally bonding I could relate to, but it just coasted slowly along until the predictable ending.  David Tennant's character wasn't particularly likable as the insecure one-hit writer.  The two women he ends up choosing between are both very pleasant, attractive, and decent--which was a nice change from the usual tripe of the snooty, spoiled actress vs. the sincerely lovable shopgirl.  He was simply out of his league with the actress and finally realized the shopgirl was a better match.  Ho Hum.  I like David Tennant in his other work, but he brought nothing new or appealing to this film.  It was if he was on holiday and just walked through the role.

4912052,5,B00606FBU2,"Tennett along with a very talented cast brings this not widely distributive film a great performance that is deeply funny and heart felt, OK yes it is more of a chick flick or a drama buff film, but it's still a not to miss film. Besides the great performances by all the cast, there is all the laugh out loud plot, and heart warming plot. It does run a little slow in spots for people who want slap stick action or a fast developing plot. It is more a British kind of paced plot and drama and if you are not use to the way they develop there plots and there humor you may be frustrated by this film.

Kelly McDonald, now in Boardwalk Empire, acquits herself well. The scenery is nice.

4912122,5,B00606FBU2,"This movie has it all: great script, actors, chemistry. If you've ever seen Brave, it might throw you off a little to hear the voice of Merida say some of the things that she does, but that just added another level if enjoyment in my book. It'll make you laugh all the way through, yet it still has a really great message. There are some lines in there that are unforgettable. I won't spoil anything, but you'll know them when you hear them. It has elements both men and women would like. Probably not for the younger viewers (though there isn't really that much language to it that I can remember).

Like some other lower budget films, it replaces the special effects and sounds with a story that makes sense, characters that are more developed, and seems complete as a movie. That being said, it is a chick flick.",1390694400,,318,4.229508196721311

4912125,2,B00606FBU2,"This movie did have some mildly funny moments. The acting wasn't bad when the characters were to stand on their own. However, in the long run the chemistry between the love interests was pretty bland and did not appear as substantial and clever as the writers decided they would jump to conclude it should be. It fails to deliver a believable ""love"" story as the writing and acting get bogged down in inconsequential and shallow course work of obliviousness and pass by the intricacies involved in the evolution of a reasonably believable deep seated love story. The latter of which is needed in order to justify the ending that just dangled from the story oddly out of place.

P.S. If looking for a few laughs and don't mind that they might taper off and morph into a quite bland and trite love story, than give it a try. Worse that can happen is you might turn it off. Right?

Half the time when they came on screen I would start to roll my eyes and start to loose interest. The only islanders I did like was the deaf couple. Oh one other thing Lara was annoying at times.

4912179,5,B00606FBU2,"This one caught my eye because I am a fan of David Tennant (""Blackpool"") so it really was a pig in a poke. What I bought was actually a lovely little romantic comedy that has some of the wittiest dialogue I've had the pleasure to hear, no bad guys, and several people to root for.

We are on a remote island in the Hebrides where an internationally known movie star is trying to get married without the army of paparazzi who relentlessly hound her tracks. Her publicist and her staff have scouted out a castle on this particular island based on her favorite book written by her fianc&eacute;. They need a decoy to lure the photographers off the scent.

Here are some of the actors:
  * Alice Eve (""Star Trek into Darkness"") is that famous actress. Not only is she famous, she's smart, kind, talented and resourceful.
  * David Tennant (""Blackpool"") is the author of her favorite book. He now  has writer's block but is completely agog over his famous fianc&eacute;e.
  * Kelly MacDonald (""Boardwalk Empire"") is a local girl come home to lick her wounds. She followed a musician to London but discovered she still has a knack for finding guys who have a fear of commitment.

Our actress's staff decides to do a pretend wedding to throw the paparazzi off track. They offer our local girl a LOT of cash; it's tempting because her terminally ill mother wants to see the world before she dies.

This is a cheery little film with charming people, an off-beat hamlet, eccentric locals and lovely scenery. It's sweet and predictable, and I'm soooo glad! I got my copy from Amazon.",1378857600,2,1572,4.618705035971223

Which would mostly be fine, though when it conflicts with how likeable the main characters are it makes things problematic. The stars make do fairly well with what they have to work with in the script and dialog, though Tennant is called upon to be really crappy enough times that you wonder why it would be good for ANYONE to marry him.

As puff goes it works out well enough and there's enough fun moments to make the 90 minutes a reasonable investment of your time. If you're looking for something that actually does characterization and challenges go rewatch Say Anything.",1378771200,,709,4.717741935483871

4912182,2,B00606FBU2,"I've never found myself faced with the possibility of disagreeing with fellow Doctor Who fans before but I *can not* let this sit - I found the film very disappointing and even slightly cringe worthy at times. This seemed to be a golden opportunity to create a chick flick with a top-notch cast and plot line - two brilliant Scottish actors fumbling around looking for love and inspiration when it's right in front of there noses...what a goldmine! For some inexplicable reason, the film never seems to get off the ground.

The tone of the film seems to vary wily nily from touching romantic comedy (which I loved) to floundering flim flam Hollywood-esque paparazzi story (which I couldn't stand) without stark enough transitions to make switches between the two which made it very confusing to get caught up in. I noticed a lack of consistent connection between the two leads during these switches which was, unfortunately, distracting from the tender moments they were able to create now and then.

Even Tennant dressed in silly garb didn't blow my Doctor Who fevered mind. I can't believe I'm saying this but Tennant looks less tortured dressing up as a woman companion then a Scottish bagpiper. See YouTube clip below (*note* it's NSFW). Something's off if Tennant appears to be having more fun in the FNP clip then he appears to be in this entire movie.

No matter, no matter - I'll remain a loyal fan of both Tennant and romantic comedies...I'll keep the two separated in my mind with a healthy distance between them for the moment.

4912183,5,B00606FBU2,"As a David Tennant fan I had been eyeing watching this movie. I normally don't do 'chick flicks' for the stuff I watch but since I have prime and it was unlimited free streaming I bit.

I was pleasantly surprised at the story. So surprised in fact I've ordered the blu ray. The movie starts out with showing a loving couple trying to marry but because she's such a big superstar she can't have the private wedding that she wants. Zoom over to a small Scottish island that is middle of know where'sville and we meet the loving heroine of the story played by the delightful Kelly Macdonald (who I recognized the voice as Merida from Pixar's Brave, also one of my favorites). She recently broke up with someone and has moved back with her dying mother.

The woman from the loving couple from earlier has picked the island to have her wedding (because the soon to be husband, David Tennant, wrote a book where it took place on that island). The superstar's stalkerish #1 paperizze fan follows and hi jinks ensue.

All the actors/actress's in this movie come alive and the movie itself has such a wonderful charm about it. It could be watched by the whole family.

It's quirky & cute & most of the characters are sweet people that you cheer for.  Naturally, there are parts during which reality is pretty thin, but some of the best movies - especially love stories - are filled with holes that require a fair bit of suspended belief.  Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers movies were ridiculous, but charming.  Tennant & Macdonald are great, and there are a few scenes that make your heart hurt.

I picked out this movie to have something in the background while I practiced drawing. I ended up grabbing a few snacks, drinks, and settling in on the couch within the first 15 minutes.

The characters and plot are very easy-going. And while there are quite a few exaggerated scenes/characters played for laughs, they are more background. The characters are exaggerated just enough from real life to make it fun and interesting, but not so much that it's distracting or corny. The beautiful scenario of Northern Scotland didn't hurt, either.",1377388800,,774,5.0

The ""author"" is a guy who was able to pull of a huge scam of having a 1,000 page travel book published without knowing (or remembering) any of the facts in it and his fiancee doesn't know the truth. The ""decoy"" swears off men after being jilted and then within 2-3 days is already in love with someone who's already engaged and who was not nice to her.

You know. Also, if you're wondering, he does his British accent in this, not his native Scottish accent, even though the movie takes place on a Scottish Isle and stars opposite a Scottish actress. I was okay with it. David Tennant. OH, and you see him in his boxers at one point (wearing a v-neck white t-shirt as well). Knobby knees. Yep!",1374278400,,674,4.524590163934426

I don't usually go in for rom-coms, most have too much sex for me, are really shallow, or very contrived and silly. This was far-fetched, but not so terribly contrived that I found myself rolling my eyes. There was no sex (though it's mentioned, it's never seen) no nudity (there's an undressing scene but not completely; you don't see anything) little language (no F-bombs, a couple words early on, but nothing truly objectionable) and very little suggestive humor. I wouldn't let my nine-year-old watch, but I probably would my thirteen-year-old.

So what is it? What's left, you say? A sweet story with an adorably awkward female lead(""I'm hotter than I look!"" ROTFL) and an equally adorable male lead who play off eachother very well. David Tennant is unusually subdued (for him; for anyone else I'd say he's just normal; he usually has the energy of about three people) but plays the part of the blocked and totally fraudulent writer very, very well. You believe he's kind of a loser; a cute loser, but a loser nonetheless. And Kelly Macdonald plays a much better aspiring writer and the published writer's biggest critic. They end up accidentally married when she plays the decoy at his wedding to his celebrity fiancee, and then have to find a way out of the marriage so he can get married to the woman that 9,800 men out of 10,000 said was the perfect match for them. (""You realize that statistically that includes 800 gay men, don't you?"" Giggle.) Except maybe she's not the perfect match for him. Maybe he married the right woman...?

the reviews i found were pretty awful, but i thought what the heck, it has david tennant in it. the movie was delightful and lighthearted. as others have said the plot was predictable but sometimes that is just fine.

i am normally not a fan of romantic comedies, can't stand to watch katherine heigle and her overwrought acting style, but this is quiet and just plain enjoyable. tennant was great, easy to watch and i only saw a few of the mouth movements he made in dr. who, that i didn't like. i think he is going to have to outgrow the who mannerisms.

the ladies, alive eve and kelly mcdonald were both wonderful, also understated - most of the time. if you are not looking for heavy drama this is a perfect film, will make you smile and laugh.

And what about when personal growth is ""to overdose on daiquiris and be thrown into a volcano"" as Katie's mum puts it? A lovely story about likable characters finding their way. After watching this film several times, I began to appreciate how truly funny it is too.

Also, although Hegg is not a real island, there are many beautiful shots of Scotland in this film. So it has joined my other ""armchair travel"" rom-coms. Highly recommended.",1369440000,,749,4.717557251908397

The only element that was redeemable about this film was the cinemetography as it takes place in the Hebrides on one of the Islands, Hegg.  The story is about a Diva actress marrying a British writer(a bad one at that)and having their wedding ruined by paparazzi.  And actually that guy was about the funniest thing in the movie!  The wedding is to be held on this remote island and Kelly MacDonald who has recently become un-engaged from someone else agrees to pose as the bride because after all she is the only single woman there in a population of seventy five.  She is reluctant to do it but is offered 5,000 pounds, a big chunk of dough and she has this sickly mother....well you know the story.  After that this movie kind of fizzles.  There are some bad attempts to isolate the groom and fake bride from newsies who have already heard about this, and there's an attempt to escape from a turret in the castle where the honeymoon suite is located.  There's a lot of splashing, ruining the wedding dress, and a bond forms between the groom and fake bride.  I was tempted to stop the DVD after about a half hour, but decided to sit it out.

I'd never heard of any of the actors before but now I'm especially a big David Tennant fan and also really appreciate Kelly McDonald's contribution to the movie; it wouldn't be the same movie (nor nearly as good) without her. The supporting cast really make the movie as well, pretty unusual; everyone is just superb. A good, clean movie, you can even watch it with the kids. Those wanting more lusty stuff might be a little disappointed but if you watch it for the humor you might never stop laughing. I think the movie is smart, hilarious, easy to follow (predictable? maybe) and easy to share and recommend. Such an unusual find these days. I'd love to see more movies like this one in America, I give it five-plus stars.

I LOVE this movie!!! I watched it originally because it had David Tennant in it, and was surprised because at the time I hadn't even realized that it had the lady who voiced Merida (Brave) in it as well. This movie was MUCH better than I expected. A good comedic flick with humor for the whole family. There is no nudity (yes there is a bit with them in their johns, but there are no scenes of a sexual nature, so it is perfect for the whole family). All the actors play their roles brilliantly, and the humor feels natural and not so much a forced slap stick like many comedy movies now.

You will be left with memorable lines such as ""Are you going to fight like a man or just throw puffins at me?"", ""I'm a whole lot hotter than I look"", and ""Wolves?There's no wolves. We don't even have bees. She might stand on a hedgehog, which would be good, actually . . . because we're overrun"".

Despite that it's a little slow in the beginning, it does pick up as it goes, and I was really touched by one of the side relationships in the movie (you'll know which one I'm talking about if you watch it yourself).

4912243,5,B00606FBU2,"Starting off this movie I figured it would be ok; I was bored and David Tennant was in the movie (everyone loves the former Doctor). I gave it a try and to my liking it really surprised me. Although the movie was very predictable that's part of what makes a romantic comedy so great. The acting was pretty on par with this style movie, maybe not a pretty woman role but again this is an excellent advancement for these two actor/actress and the supporting people.

The movie did seem a bit slow in parts however it is late at night that I am watching this film so my attention span is less than. I would recommended to any other guy looking for a romantic movie to watch with your significant other (guy or girl)to put this one on, you with both get a kick out of some of the funny parts and David Tennant is awkward and funny enough to make any couple laugh a bit.

Kelly Macdonald did sell her part very well even if at times it was hard to take it seriously, due to the over dramatized back story they gave her. However she did play an excellent female lead to David as these two mesh very well on screen, with out over power each other. All and all I give this movie a 5 out of 5 and I would highly recommended anyone to watch this film!",1363651200,2,1241,4.145228215767635

The third star is for making all of the characters...even the less scrupulous, likable.  Yes, even the ""wrong"" woman is a lovely, likable person, and I have to appreciate that.  Most of the time in rom coms like this one, there is one horrendous person that makes you wonder what the ""hero/heroine"" is thinking to begin with.  Not this film.

I'm not normally a romantic comedy fan, which perhaps makes me biased, but he was a zany, funny actor on DW, so I thought I'd give it a shot since it was free to stream on prime. It was a way to pass two hours, but not a particularly great one.

Tennant is much more quiet and restrained in this film, still a little snarky, but not as funny as he was as the Doctor. McDonald was alright, but her performance wasn't memorable. The narrative as a whole was flat and unbelievable, and the characters of passing interest at the most.

If you want more of Tennant's more lively humor or more of the angst he portrayed as Ten, go re-watch an episode from series two, three, or four. Don't try this movie simply because you're a DW fan.",1359417600,2,825,4.282051282051282

My initial response was not a good one, and I would have given it two stars at that time. After several additional viewings, I've settled at three stars. I think Kelly Macdonald saves the film. She gives her character some life and levity. David Tennant, a gifted and usually brilliant actor, just seems so uncomfortable here. Maybe that's how his character is scripted, but that's not entirely clear. I didn't see him loosen up until almost the end of the film. Again, maybe that's the way it was written, but it left me, as the viewer, feeling uncomfortable. I've seen him play a number of different characters, some of whom were tightly wound, and one who was downright disturbing, but always felt like he was present in the role. I wasn't so sure here. I think the script is thin and somewhat silly. There are much better romantic comedies around. I watched it for the actors, not for the story.",1358121600,,1102,4.627551020408164

The heroine, Katie, is a typical woman.  She's believable in every way because she isn't model-like beauty and she isn't a damsel in distress bull.  I liked this character very much.

The hero, James, was also likeable.  But the writers could have developed his character more.  We don't learn much about why he decided to google about a place for his book.  Why he put so much detail about this Scottish Island called Hegg, calling it beautiful and all these other terms he used from a thesaurus. This book somehow became a bestseller.  And now the poor guy has writer's block.  But he is happy because he's about to marry a world famous actress (think Angelina Jolie).  But this woman doesn't want the press involved and with rightful reasons.  I just didn't really like her though. She comes off as needy and spoiled.

Loved it!  I thought this was a totally charming romantic comedy.  Kelly MacDonald is absolutely charming and her lilting way of speaking makes her near irresistible! This also has a good soundtrack.

Decent romantic comedy story (it follows the usual formula for a romantic comedy - but so what?).

First the script, which, according to the ""Making Of"" had been around for a few years before it finally was green lighted for production. Sadly, it seems as if no one had bothered to read, revise or edit the script so the continuity was lacking, as was character development and in a movie where characters are the key, that is crucial. At 89 minutes, it felt hacked in the editing which may have been necessary to cut out the worst parts. As in all Brit-Com Rom-com movies the hero,or heroine in this case, goes through trying situations that bring clarity and relief when the right people get together. In The Decoy Bride, the relief comes when the end credits roll. True, MacDonald and Tennant do show show some truly funny bits, but you can see them all in the trailer. In watching the ""Making Of"" it looked more like these fine actors did the film out of a sense of obligation to past due debts. The show must go on, and all that.

I thought it was pretty good. It's a romantic comedy, well written, acted and directed, and the scenery was gorgeous. The plot was reminiscent of Notting Hill  - (an actress being chased by the paparazzi) - but in this movie they use decoy brides to try and throw the paparazzi off.

Alos different, it's the groom and the decoy bride who carry the movie, so a different enough plot that I didn't feel I was watching a re-run.

It was really fun to watch - the chemistry between all the eclectic characters was just lovely, and the message of what lasting love really looks like is illustrated with a light but accurate brush. I particularly liked the modest humor and intelligence of the heroine, the extremely watchable comic ""marketing man"" played with sardonic perfection by Michael Urie, and the deaf elderly couple dancing to the appalling howl of bagpipes with the light of true love and tenderness in their eyes.

A beautiful message about love delivered in a charming note, I recommend it for anyone at home on an evening who would like a break and an emotional lift.

This has a totally different feel to it and places the viewer very quickly on a remote Scottish island where ordinarily nothing ever happens but that is about to change. The movie reeks with charm and atmosphere and captivated us from the very beginning.

4912347,5,B00606FBU2,"The first movie I saw Kelly Macdonald in was ""Girl In The Cafe"" & I loved it. With every picture I am all the more impressed. In this film she's a bit down on her luck, going back home to Mom on a little island in the Hebrides. The scenery alone is spectacular & Kelly is even more so. This does remind me somewhat of the Cary Grant & Katherine Hepburn films, where it's obvious to everyone but themselves they are meant for each other. So the film is all about delaying that until the last possible moment. "" Leap Year "" also comes to mind, but I'm remembering "" Bringing Up Baby "" or  "" Holiday "" as good examples. So general mayhem in-sues with a good bit of nasty verbal conflict, all in good fun, but it's her accent that makes her all the more fun for me to watch & listen to. Of course, there is the Betty & Veronica aspect here, an old device ( i.e. A Midsummer's Night Dream ) although the two don't come to a catfight ( ......damn it....). There's lot's here to enjoy & I am going to come back to this one a few more times to see what I missed during the laughing too hard bits.

4912350,5,B00606FBU2,"David Tennant plays a writer, James Arber, whose published only one book in his life:  The Ornithologist's Wife which is about four inches thick and, from what everyone in the movie says about it, absolutely horrible.

The book takes place on the this tiny little Island off the coast of Scotland that no one's ever heard of or visits.

James is engaged to America's sweetheart, Actress Lara Tyler (played by Alice Eve), and paparazzi keep interrupting their wedding forcing them to post pone over and over again.

Finally, Lara decides to surprise her husband-to-be by having an Ornithologist's Wife themed wedding.

Sending her manager and assistant to the island the book takes place on, we meet our Heroine, Katie Nic Aodh (played by Kelly Macdonald), a poor young woman nursing a broken heart as she returned to her hometown after a broken engagement.  There, she's asked to write a travel guide to the island, trying to promote tourism.
When Lara's manager and assistant meet her, she brings them to the castle on the island where James' book takes place.  While these two Americans are expecting to see a beautiful, sprawling castle, they find themselves confronted by a falling apart pile of rocks.  They draw one conclusion:  James Googled his entire book!  He'd never been to the island in his life!

Getting to work, the two set about fixing up the castle for the wedding because what Lara wants, Lara gets.

While only 7 people in the whole world knew they were getting married on the Island, Lara's main paparazzo still managed to find them.  Lara disappears, not wanting to make the headlines again, and the assistant and manager both decide to throw a fake wedding anyway (not realizing that Scottish Marriage laws are different from American)!

They hire Kelly, bribing her with 5 thousand pounds, to dress up as the bride and go through with the wedding so they could fool the paparazzo and have the real wedding after Lara is located.  At first Kelly is reluctant but, knowing her mother is dying of cancer and her one last wish is to see the world, Kelly accepts the money and the job.
Problem:  They decide NOT to tell the groom!!

And this is just the beginning!  The movie is full of British humor as they run around trying to stay a step ahead of the Paparazzi and trying to find the true bride.  People keep following the map drawn out in The Ornithologist's Wife which keeps leading them to the wrong area since James had googled the whole book.

I really enjoyed this movie but might have only given it four stars until I got to the ending and the 'make up' line - that line when you realize the Happily Ever After is upon us.  That was the best line I've ever heard.  I actually teared up and this was a COMEDY!

So I highly recommend this movie.  I'm about to go watch it again.  Just remember, it is British comedy made for a British audience.  Their humor is a bit different from ours but I still find it funny and some things they're going to expect you to know without spelling it out for you.  But its still very easy to follow along with.

And my sister is wondering if the main actress is a makeup model because she looks so familiar to her, but I think it's just because she's a cosmetologist and she's totally got makeup models on the brain.

The one thing that did surprise me was the quality of the video.  I know it's not a big budget film but it's a recent film so I excepted a little higher quality visuals for an blu ray disc.  I will usually give a movie a break if there are a few lower quality scenes because of lighting or what not but in this case it just seemed to happen pretty often.  Not enough for me to hate the film just enough that I was thinking about it.

Being a small budget film I didn't expect any extras or ones worth watching but to my surprise there were a couple.  One that I really liked showed the different Special Effects layering of the scenes.

We usually by discs (partially blu ray) for the higher quality visuals and the extras.  I feel a little let down on the visuals.  As mentioned on the extras, didn't have any expectations for this film so any worth watching was more than we had hoped.

Would I buy this disc knowing all of this now?  I'm not sure how often we'll back to this one compared to other rom coms we have.  And of course as soon as we bought it, it came out on Netflix streaming...had I know that I definitely wouldn't have...but not everyone has Netflix.

4912380,5,B00606FBU2,"My wife loves all things David Tennant, and when she ran across a mention of The Decoy Bride she asked if we could order it. What I've seen of Tennant I liked, so I agreed and a couple of days later the disc arrived in my mailbox. I wasn't really expecting a lot - romantic comedies aren't often very deep, but they can be a lot of fun. The Decoy Bride delivered fun and more.

First of all, Tennant was perfect as James, the author of an enormous novel set on the (fictitious) Outer Hebrides island of Hegg, but it soon becomes clear that he really knows nothing about Hegg.  I had not seen Kelly MacDonald before, but she was delightful as Katie, the last single young woman on the island. The supporting cast was unfamiliar to me as well - yes, I know that some were in very popular TV shows - but they all played their part to perfection.

What really delighted me, though, was that director Sheree Folkson, also new to me, brought a perspective to the film not commonly found with plots similar to this. So you have the beautiful actress Lara, played by Alice Eve, who is to be wed to Tennant's James. In a typical Hollywood take on this theme, Lara would be a shrew, or shallow, generally unpleasant, or some combination of these.  But no, Lara is indeed as kind, generous, smart and resourceful as James protests she is. She just isn't the right match for James. Marco the paparazzo stalking Lara, is set up as a sort of villain, but he too has a good heart.  Indeed, everyone in this film, even those who do ""not so nice"" things, has redeeming elements. You can't hate anyone, and things work out for more of the cast than you might normally expect.

In some ways, The Decoy Bride reminds me of the Howard Hawks screwball comedies of the 1930s - smart scripting, enthusiastic acting and just a lot of fun. The beautiful settings, shot on the Isle of Man and in Scotland, are wonderful in their own regard.

The Blu-Ray disc has some extras: one deleted scene (not even worth viewing), interviews with the cast, director and writers (provided in short snippets), some ""behind the scenes"" shots (which were fun - I noticed that in these one of the cast asked for ""a cellphone"", but in the actual movie ""a mobile"" was correctly requested), and a clip about special effects (which were minimal.) The music of the movie was great as well.

My wife and I both enjoyed The Decoy Bride very much. It may seem like just another ""rom-com"", but it really rises above that. Highly recommended.",1341446400,5,2489,4.466960352422907

The writing was great, the chemistry, the overall pace - and I liked that it wasn't the traditional romance with the obvious ending. As an American I'm used to the guy getting the girl halfway through the movie so I was like ""Kiss her already you idiot!"" but it was just done perfectly.

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something light, something that will make them smile, (though I cried too), and something that leaves you glad to have spent two hours in another world. In other words, I highly recommend this to everyone!

Buy it and enjoy!",1337212800,14,808,4.482993197278912
4912389,5,B00606FBU2,"Admittedly, the only reason I got this film was to see David Tennant outside of the DOCTOR WHO realm. My expectations were low and so imagine my utter surprise when I found myself completely drawn in by this wonderful little comedy! The plot is pretty simple, but this film is so much more enjoyable because the writing is great and the actors are far more fun to watch than the standard American romantic comedy leads. Because the dialogue is delivered by actors who inhabit their character as opposed to actresses trying to pose as thespians, this film has a lot of heart going for it. And even though it's somewhat predictable, you cannot help but be entertained. No need to give you any plot points, but if you're a David Tennant fan, then you'll enjoy the film. If you like comedies that are not bombastic in their approach, then you'll be smitten. If you like excellent dialogue and quarky characters, then you might just fall in love with the film. Not the greatest story ever todl, but DECOY BRIDE is a far better film than anything featuring Katherine Hiegel and Jennifer Anniston. These actresses could learn a thing or two about sutbtleness, which is why this film works so well. Can't help it....I'm under the DECOY BRIDE's spell and am most likely going to buy this film on Blu Ray as it's a great film when you need cheering up and want a smile on your face!",1337040000,58,1372,4.558704453441296
4912390,5,B00606FBU2,"At the time I'm writing this, unfortunately, this movie is not available on DVD in the U.S., and as I cannot find any current plans to release it in the U.S., I finally bit the bullet and paid the Amazon rental price (especially since it's been lowered from it's original $9.99 price). I'm really glad I did. The movie started out a bit shaky, and I found myself really not liking any of the characters, even (I shudder to admit it because I adore the actor) David Tennant's character of James. In the beginning, James is kind of a prat, and Katie's a bit on the desperately awkward side and you find yourself wondering if you even want them to get together. As the movie goes on, the characters (and the laughs) improved and I found myself entirely wrapped up in the love story and laughing out loud as I watched. I will say that I would have liked it if Lara and, yeah, even Marco were better developed, but as it was, that would have taken away from the love story between James and Katie, so I suppose I'm okay with it. Definitely worth a view, except that now my problem is that I'm even more anxious to own it on DVD. Maybe someday... (hint, hint).",1334966400,3,1154,4.32258064516129

Isn't that why we all watch these types of films? So if your a fan of romantic comedies and love to pine after the male lead in the film or you just happen to love David tennant and want a happy ending.

It was an entertaining romantic comedy.  I love films that don't need to be sexually explicit in order to tell the story.  The odd country characters made an interesting side note to a nice little film.

It was 89 minutes well spent, and I'm actually going to watch it again.",1332028800,8,539,4.505154639175258
4912413,5,B00606FBU2,"This is a fantastic movie! Kelly Macdonald is the star of the show as the charming and loveable Katie, but David Tennant and Alice Eve produce very strong performances as well.

While the movie isn't very thought-invoking or deep, it is a wonderful fluff-filled romantic comedy. Kelly Macdonald is perfect in the role of Katie, a small town Scottish girl, who is a very relatable character. Kelly Macdonald proves that she has lots of talent, and can be both funny and serious. I will admit that I am a huge David Tennant fan, but I think that he is a very talented actor, and his performance here is certainly no letdown. Alice Eve is also lovely as Lara Tyler, movie actress extraordinaire, and the three main actors work together very well. I found some of the supporting actors, particularly Michael Urie to be interesting and charming.

All in all, the Decoy Bride is a well-written, well-acted romantic comedy. It's funny, it's sweet, and I would recommend it to anyone who is either a fan of David Tennant, or a fan of romantic comedies.",1331596800,4,1044,4.699453551912568

4912416,4,B00606FBU2,"Three and a half stars.

First, let me confess that I rented this because I'm a crazed David Tennant fan. And while I enjoyed this film, oddly enough I didn't find Tennant to be the strongest part of it. Tennant plays James in a far more restrained, less manic mode than he played the Doctor. James is amusingly snarky, and displays quite a bit of sweetness and vulnerability as the movie progresses, but he's lacking in energy, and doesn't really bounce off the screen. The character is also rather sober, which means Tennant doesn't get to smile nearly enough. Without smiles, he's a rather solemn-looking fellow, and his natural charm and joie de vivre fail to shine through in much of this movie. If I weren't already a Tennant fan, I'm not sure this movie would make me one.

The real star of ""The Decoy Bride"" is Kelly MacDonald. She's charming and adorable, playing an offbeat but delightful character very well. She also has a lot of chemistry with Tennant. Most of it is cute banter, but there is one scene where they're both getting out of wet clothes that is just dripping (so to speak) with sexual tension. Tennant also gets the sexual tension across convincingly in this scene, and I'd like to see more of it. The man can smolder like no one else on this planet.

That's something that's missing from too much of this movie-- sexual tension, longing, and kisses. Even though Katie and James are clearly falling for each other, I'd like to see a little more of their physical attraction onscreen. I felt just a little shorted in that department. Add to that an awkward contrivance near the end and minor characters that aren't well developed, and the movie didn't entirely gel for me. It does have some terrific moments-- the rescue scene, the aforementioned undressing scene, the ending itself-- but those moments don't quite add up to a wonderful movie.

Overall, I enjoyed the scenery and the accents (it's unfortunate that Tennant couldn't use his natural Scottish accent, but MacDonald's accent is terrific), and the romance was convincing enough to make this a pleasant way to spend ninety minutes. The movie was fun and sweet, and I'll probably buy the DVD if it ever becomes available. But if I weren't already a rabid, foaming-at-the-mouth David Tennant fangirl, I don't think this movie would have struck me as anything I needed to purchase for my DVD collection.",1330992000,12,2385,4.767554479418886
4912417,5,B00606FBU2,"While it's not a cinematic masterpiece, it is definitely a delightful watch. Subtle humor and an excellent cast add to the pleasure that is this movie. It was exactly what I expected: a sweet, charming movie with an expected plot. And a must-watch for David Tennant fans. I think I watched it about 5 or 6 times in one day.

4912418,5,B00606FBU2,"It's a case of: Writer meets Writer and two people who have nothing in common find out that they actually understand each other quite well, and even make a good pair.

4912419,5,B00606FBU2,"For delightful scenery, lovely accents and a nonformulaic approach to the usual chick flick formula, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  The plucky working class heroine maintains a dignity leavened by some goofy lines.  The clueless hero has some rough edges and selfish motives.  The celebrity princess is tough and can look out for herself!  And the path to the foregone conclusion?  Enough twists to keep us all entertained.  I shared my rental with a friend, and we laughed, and aaahed.  Even the villain of the piece turns out to have a heart of gold.  Add to that the charming moments of village life, seaside life, and people married so long they don't remember why they married, but love each other anyway, and this is a richly textured movie with a beating heart.  Yes, I want to watch it again.

8490131,2,B00606FBU2,"This looked stupid. I skipped over it like 10 times but finally, given the reviews, I gave it a shot. It was horrible. This is the story. A pretentious and annoying author has written an overly long book about a Scottish island. Hegg. Which is a big hit - it was never really clear. This author is engaged to the Angelnia Jolie of this world - Lara Tyler. How this happened I will never know. After their first wedding is ruined by the parprazzi they are determined to find a secluded spot and head for Hegg.  At Hegg, James Arber, the pretentious author, meets a local townie Katie. Their initial meet cute is supposed to be funny and cute but I just didn't get.  Pretentious author assumes that Katie lives in a public toilet -- even though when he meets her she has a big raincoat on.  He gets offended by her critique of his book and then for some unknown reason she asks him out.  I guess when you live on a small island you can't be too picky. Lara's manager finds out there is press on the island and comes up with the idea to grab Katie to be a faux bride. To stand in for Lara.  I never really got that. Lara has meanwhile run off to investigate how the press got there.

But wait for it... now, Katie and James get *faux* married but, really do get married as James signs something that makes them legally married... oh noooossss. That is like something right out of a 1931 movie. Who cares today? It is a piece of paper?

David Tennant is utterly uncharming and I can see no reason for Katie or Lara to find anything attractive about him.  I understand he has a massive following from some show but if you haven't seen it.. you won't be convinced here.  Katie is no find either as she is extremely awkward and if you have ever seen Kelly MacDonald she has a stilted way of speaking due to her accent which doesn't work well for romance.

There is just no reason for anyone to be ""falling"" in love here.  But yet, they are.  That is a sign of a bad romantic movie.  A lot of this movie just doesn't make sense and is extremely strained.

Just skip it.",1523145600,,2061,4.2378516624040925
