778006,4,630408434X,"This version of Lumet's THE GROUP is presented in the original 1:66 to 1 aspect ratio - however the DVD is letterboxed instead of anamorphiccally enhanced for 16:9 television screens.  Fox/MGM on demand DVDs would do well to follow suit with the WARNER BROS. archive collection and present their widescreen films progressively scanned, and with anamorphic enhancement.  I would expect that scope films in their catalogue (like TRAPEZE and TWO FOR THE SEESAW) are anamorphic, or there will be further customer complaints at their price point.  That said, the print used is acceptable and true to the theatrical look of the picture.

As for the film, it's a superb soap opera, thanks to Sidney Buchman's excellent adaptation of the Mary McCarthy novel.  The character vignettes are energetic, and combine for a telling mosaic of the decade preceding World War II.  The performances are perceptive ones, and by the time the picture is over, you're convinced that these characters have honestly evolved.  Photographed by Boris Kaufmann with a handsome clarity.  Sharp and smart.",1262822400,27,1074,5.203488372093023

778009,3,630408434X,"It is my view that some types of novel do better when adapted for Tv rather than the movies and The Group by Mary McCarthy is one example .While not a long novel -like Dickens or the great Victorians wrote ( whose books also cry out for TV rather than cinema simply because they are so long)-it is one with a great many characters and even at 150 minutes the movie simply cannot do justice to them all
The Group was one of the earliest movies to show  women's emotional development as individuals ,not simply lost souls awaiting salvation from the penis owning half of the world .
It is based on a book that is hard on the adapter having a focus on 8 graduates from Vassar in 1933 and tracing their lives over a 20 year period .It tries as does the book to give equal time to them all but in trying to cram so much into the movie the result is that it feels unweildy and some of the characters emerge as sketches not fully rounded portraits  .Much of the author's social and political views have been eliminated and the movie is the poorer for it

The women are Lakey (Candice Bergen -on debut)as the Sapphic ""Lakey"" Dottie( Joan Hackett);Priss ( Elizabeth Hartman)'Polly (Shirley Knight);Kay (Joanna Pettet) Pokey ( Mary-Robin Redd) 'Helena (Kathleen Widdoes) and Libby (Jessica Walter )The men in their lives are mostly weak and disposable

Director Sidney Lumet seems unsure if the material should be treated as satire or soap and it is the soap operish elements that fare better /And there are several of them -there are such soap staples as lesbianism ,alcoholism ,frigidity ,death and war . It seems appropriate given the ""soapish proceedings that Larry Hagman crops up as one of the men involved
The best episode for me was the lightest as Polly wryly copes with her eccentric father who is allegedly crazy and shrewdly exploits this ""fact""
The period detail in the De Luxe photography of Boris Kaufman is impeccable and the all NY female cast do well .The basic problems are the uncertainty of directorial tone and a movie too full of characters to give us a coherent and wholly focussed narrative

This is still a work that should be seen and its reltively unknown status is sad",1196812800,6,2187,4.58312020460358
778010,5,630408434X,"I first saw this movie when I was 11 and didn't understand half of what I was seeing because so much was coded or unsaid. This wonderful film is based on Mary McCarthy's book about 8 Vassar grads as they went forth, in the Depression Era, to make their contributions to emergent America and realize the potential of their educations.

This was the first movie I ever saw that discussed sexuality, marriage, and manners among the upper-middle class. This was the first film that used the words Lesbo and Sapphic. Other firsts were depictions of the mentally ill, adultery, female alcoholism, open marriage, domestic violence, psychoanalysis, pregnancy, childbearing and rearing, and childlessness within the historical context of the 1930s.

Somewhat a soap opera, the ensemble cast is excellent, the acting believable, and wardrobe breathtaking. So many hats, gowns, and everyday suits for women to enjoy.

A great film that I really wish was available for purchase.",1195430400,5,966,5.17948717948718

778012,4,630408434X,"Sidney Lumet gives this movie a glossy sheen, and it is certainly dated with a sense of pretension.  However, the story, about a group of lberal-educated women in the 30s/40s, is fascinating in its truly bold depiction of issues rarely raised in the movies of the 50s and 60s.  The issues these women confront as they weave themselves into ordinary life play like a prequel to Valley Of The Dolls -- with some camp intact.  Jessica Walter plays her frigid society girl to the hilt, while Shirley Knight has a gorgeous glow as perhaps the most humane member of the group.  The costumes and art direction are much more 50s/60s than 30s chic -- and this detracts from the story, which is infinitely more compelling and even shocking knowing that these women -- who speak freely of communism and lesbianism -- are essentially products of a Depression-era college.  Still, what fun to peek into the living quarters of these Manhattanites, and watch the soap suds rise.",993427200,25,963,4.77710843373494

probably not one that would appeal to men.  Still, it is interesting because it illustrates that times and circumstances may change, but human
nature does not.  It was a little like reading the diary of a lady in her youth who is no longer here - somewhat enjoyable, somewhat sad.  As Taylor

778134,3,630408434X,"Some people may deride 'The Group' as a soap opera. To which I would reply that I don't think it is -- it's much more complicated than the term allows, and even if it were just a soap, it's a beaut. The women's stories are varied and involving (and I think at one time or another I've met, or maybe been, most of them.)
Moreover, it's startling to realise this was a pre-Stonewall movie, given that the strongest, smartest, and most beautiful of the Group, and the only one who ends up in a happy relationship - Lakey, played by the heartstoppingly beautiful Candice Bergen - is an uncloseted, unabashed lesbian. At a time when 'The Children's Hour' and 'The Killing of Sister George' typified the treatment of gay women onscreen, and the obligatory ending for a gay character in books and movies was a choice between hanging yourself and blowing your brains out, I can't overstress what a brave movie this was. However, the bravery more or less ended there -- the bisexuality of Larry Hagman's character, strongly implied in Mary McCarthy's book, is here reduced to one double portrait on his artist roommate's wall that makes you go 'hmm.' In his final scene with Candice Bergen in her sportscar - a sly joke, in that everything about her little red coupe is inverted (steering wheel on the right, doors hinge in the back) watch Hagman's lips - one line was obviously censored and redubbed.
The movie is a different creature in many other ways from the book; though much dialogue is picked up verbatim, it's often given a different spin. The movie also, wisely, pares away much sociopolitical debate of the book, letting it emerge implicitly through the plot and characterisation rather than the didactic debates of McCarthy's novel. Characters who dominate in McCarthy's novel may recede into the background in the movie and vice versa. So consider them as separate creatures and enjoy both.
All the performances are good, and some are great. Among the women, I'd single out, in addition to Bergen, Jessica Walter as Libby; you feel vaguely guilty laughing at her. Among the men, of course, Larry Hagman is the standout; I'd rather watch him sleep than sit through most other actors' Hamlet. Here, in his Jeannie days, he is lean, loose-limbed and handsomely vulpine, as a bad guy in a very different mode from JR Ewing. In the last scene, an extended closeup a two-shot matching him against the amazing Bergen with her razor cheekbones and cut-diamond eyes, it's almost so distracting you don't hear the dialogue - just stare.
An unusual treat is the score, which brings to mind the unconventional zither score of 'The Third Man.' 'The Group' also passes up the usual orchestral score for entirely a cappella women's choir, ranging from 1930s novelty pop songs to Henry Purcell's 'Come Ye Sons of Art' (changed, in another nice touch, to 'daughters'; a lot of care went into this movie!).
Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD didn't have the same care devoted to it. 'The Group' has been neglected -- darned if I know why. The DVD has been made with the best available material, which is just sad. There are no extras and no scene selection, just the movie. Apparently this is the best DVD we're going to get. Having worn out my VHS copy, I'd rather have this than no DVD, but I could have wished for better.",1405296000,12,3313,4.723661485319516

778185,4,630408434X,"I was too young to see this movie when it came out, but I saw it in the 70's. It's pretty much like I remember. It reminds me of other films where the characters talk very fast at times, almost manic in some scenes. There is a bit of melodrama, but still, I knew that when I purchased it. It is neat to see the actresses at a young age, and Larry Hagman must have already been preparing for the JR Ewing role, as his character was a jerk. Candace Bergen is so young, it's hard to picture her as Murphy Brown. It had a pretty good ""group"" of stars, and although some have passed away, they remain forever young in this film. I know some reviews state that it is not complete, but I am happy enough with what is there. Better than not having it. I agree however that the cover art is very bad, and you would think it would be better since they charge nearly 20 bucks for the DVD. The low resolution image should not have been enlarged, as it loses clarity and the text is not legible. I will keep an eye out for images I can replace it with, but for now I will leave it as is.

Had not read the book first, but could tell it would have been much more detailed than the film, of course.

The movie does a good job of translating the book to the screen. The cast is superior, filled with great actors at the start of their careers. Candice Bergen was 19! Too bad we've lost so many of the cast.

Some on them have felt the hard times of the depression others are living off the interest of their interest, so even though they are all friends there are many different sides to them.  Based on the novel by Mary McCarthy it tries to cover all the aspects that she wrote about.  The basic story lines are there but much of McCarthy's nuance cannot be transferred to film.  Nevertheless, it is worth seeing even if only for all the new faces of the day including Candace Bergen's movie debut as Elinor Eastlake, the token lesbian as well as Larry Hagman's jerky alcoholic Harald.

It's especially nice to be able to see so many big stars when they were quite young (Larry Hagman, Candice Bergen and Richard Mulligan, to name a few). I don't think the film did the book justice and I wondered why filmmakers in 1966 felt the need to censor some parts to the point viewers might not be able to fully understand what is being talked about. Because this film doesn't let viewers get close to the girls, they can't empathize as well with the events that unfold; they cannot see themselves (or their friends) in the various characters. The book version does this quite well, which may be why it holds up over time. The book also gives free and easy social history lessons, showing the fascinating differences between being a college girl in the '30s and being one today.
