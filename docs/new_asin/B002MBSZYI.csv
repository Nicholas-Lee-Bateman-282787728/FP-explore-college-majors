8373801,5,B002MBSZYI,"I grew up in the 80's and of course I are familar with Europe's work.  I, like you have heard ""The Final Countdown"" 70,000 times since 1986 and feel it's a shame that most people only know the band from this one song.  This CD/DVD shows the band recorded Unplugged (mostly as the title suggests) and on fire 25 years into their career!  The setlist is well varied and draws from Europe's body of work going back to their first LP in 1983 as well as some great covers by Pink Floyd, UFO, Zeppelin and Thin Lizzy.  Are the covers better than the originals?  No, but every band member plays superb and prove they had all the right influences from the 70's.  Joey still sounds great and lends some nice acoustic guitar to mostly every song.  And John Norum, oh my God, this guy can play his ass off!  After seeing this, you'll forget all about that other Swedish guitar player from the 80's.  At least John's solos are varied and he is not overly concerned with speed (i.e. he plays with feeling, alot of it!)  Yes, they do perform ""The Final Countdown"" but in an entirely different arrangement that makes the song seem fresh again.  If you like hard rock from the 80's or even the 70's, give it a try.  I was surprised at how much I loved it.

PS - I know they released only the CD in 2009.  For some reason the CD/DVD combo was not released until 2010.  After owning the CD for a good year and knowing the video was out there I forked over some bucks and had no reget.  The only thing that disappoints me is the retail price that this going for (WTF).  I say shop around. (I got mine for $28.)",1272672000,2,1591,4.232558139534884
