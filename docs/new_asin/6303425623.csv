644679,5,6303425623,i have been waiting years for this movie to come out on disc.  this is a good history of the irish in there home land and then how they are treat when then get to the states. the movie has an outstanding cast.,1340323200,4,209,3.86046511627907
644680,5,6303425623,Very interesting story about the lives of the Irish people in Ireland and their progression into America.  Series packed with famous and talented actors.  Young (pre-Remington Steele) Pierce Brosnan is superb and true to his Irish origins.  Brosnan changes from a young insolent horse-boy to a well respected businessman.  Kate Mulgrew is also very good as his girlfriend and then wife.  Their relation is genuine and lovable.  A must-see mini-series!,1316995200,2,451,5.371428571428571
644681,1,6303425623,"I ordered a ""three"" cassette set of the mini series ""Manions of America"".  I received a ""one"" cassette, extended
play movie.  I viewed it on two different video players and the quality was terrible, adequate tracking was impossible and the images were fuzzy. The second time I tried to watch the movie, the tape inside broke! I am very dissatisfied with the product and I will not be ordering any more items in the future.

644682,5,6303425623,"This was a very enjoyable story, although the video was a bit dark in places,but this did not spoil the enjoyment. The musical soundtrack was also excellent.  The entire cast played very good parts, but I was particularly impressed with Kate Mulgrew, whose English accent for the historical period of the film was flawless [I am an English dialogue teacher, so I am speaking from experience].  I would not hesitate to recommend this mini-series to anyone.",1278979200,,455,4.973684210526316
644683,1,6303425623,"Boy, did my memory not serve me well on this! I remembered loving this when it came out a thousand years ago - perhaps my mind was clouded by Pierce Brosnan's beautifulness at the time. When I sat down to watch my newly purchased copy a couple of weeks ago and the credits listed Agnes Nixon (who created All My Children & One Life to Live) as the story creator and producer, I should have ejected it from my old VCR immediately and thrown it into the nearest bin. Alas, I was not that bright and managed to make it through about two-thirds of this corny, soapy mess before running screaming. No amount of money I paid was worth sticking it out until the end. The horrible dialog, bodice ripping romance novel storyline and bad Z grade miniseries 80's actors made for an excruciating experience. There's even a bit where Brosnan's poor servant character steals a kiss from Kate Mulgrew's spoiled rich girl, and when she raises up her riding crop to threaten him, he pulls her back down into an embrace by gentling her like he would a horse! ""Shh! Shh! Shh! Steady-steady!"" GAG. With all the horrible fake English and Irish accents around him, I'm surprised Brosnan made it through filming without throwing up. And thank God NBC paid to have his teeth fixed before he assumed the role of Remington Steele, or we might never have seen him on film ever again. They weren't hideous, but they weren't the pearly whites we're accustomed to. He did a lot of not smiling, but that may have been less about his teeth and more about this rotten production...",1253318400,11,1548,4.551971326164875
644684,5,6303425623,"This is the story of Rory O'Manion (Pierce Brosnan) from young adult hood and his fight against the oppressive English in Ireland. From the potato famine and loss of his mother, to his love for the English landlord's daughter Rachel (Kate Mulgrew: of Star Trek Voyager),and subsequent flight to the shores of America. From poor to rich in America, but still longing for the freedom for his beloved Ireland. Also starring Linda Purl (The Exorcist), Nicholas Hammond (Sound of Music, Spiderman), David Soul (Starsky & Hutch), and Simon MacCorkindale. Very moving, interesting to watch Pierce Brosnan in the early days of his career.",1070496000,14,630,5.12621359223301
644685,3,6303425623,"Pierce Brosnan and Kate Mulgrew lead an otherwise lifeless cast in this tale about an immigrant Irishman coming to America.  ""The Manions of America"" is sometimes educational, depicting the hardships of Ireland during the potato famine, but history quickly submits to romance between Brosnan and Mulgrew, turning the film into an oveblown melodrama.  However, it is a must see for romance viewers and for Brosnan fans who are tired of seeing him as James Bond.",975110400,7,460,5.12

It is the story of a brother and sister from Ireland and their struggle to make ends meet  along with the love they shared with their English spouses. Manions of America too is a more than six hour long lesson in Irish/American history.",1430265600,,319,4.678571428571429

644938,5,6303425623,This is the first show I saw Pierce Brosnan in and boy did he leave an impression.  With his blue eyes and cheeky looks.  An emotional story about the plight in Ireland and the love engendered by the people for their country.  The all consuming love of a woman for a man above all else.  A lovely series to have in any collection.,1410739200,,330,4.190476190476191

645059,5,6303425623,"I always enjoy a good historical fiction miniseries--especially when there's a good love story involved--and Manions definitely fits the bill. Brosnan and Mulgrew play their characters beautifully and the story, while a bit predictable at times, is definitely engaging. If you're a fan of Far and Away or Downton Abbey, you'll love The Manions of America.",1389744000,,355,5.357142857142857
645060,3,6303425623,"We found it hard to understand the dialog with the heavy Irish accents in the first half of the mini-series.

But Pierce is always gorgeous and great to look at.",1388448000,,352,4.661290322580645

645063,1,6303425623,"This DVD has terrible sound, which sounds like it was made in an ECHO CHAMBER, with a very ""TIN"" sound, making it impossible to understand anything that the actors are saying.

645066,5,6303425623,It was very interesting to learn this was Pierce Brosnan first movie. It has a good story about an Irish immigrant moving to Philadelphia.

and petticoats all the way!!!",1371168000,,194,5.5
645166,5,6303425623,Great film about the potato famine in Ireland.  It shows how immigrants had to leave their homelands and family behind to make a living in America.  When they could they brought their families over to join them.  They were not afraid to work hard to get ahead. This was one of Pierce's earlier movies before his teeth were fixed.,1369785600,,329,4.5423728813559325

645173,2,6303425623,"The portrayal of the way many of the Irish lived and were treated was fairly historical, but the rest was unbelievable, the plot was rubbish and unconnected, and also not believable, like they started as ""Shanty Irish"" and ended up cultured in a short period of time, also the cutured English lady is hububbing and romanticizing with the ""Shanty Irish""  to bad such good actors had to be wasted on this debacle.

Also , at that period of time, most of the Irish only spoke Gaelic, until they were forced to speak English in their schools, which most Irish weren't even attending at that time.",1344211200,,592,4.628571428571429
