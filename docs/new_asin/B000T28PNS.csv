If you're looking for content, then Kappa Mikey is not for you because it is WAY too zany.  What it lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in comedy.  So if you like funny cartoons then Kappa Mikey is for you, but if you desire drama then look somewhere else.",1193961600,5,392,4.2
2892745,5,B000T28PNS,"Even though this DVD isn't even out yet, unless they totally screw it up and rip everyone off somehow, I'm giving it five stars.  Why five stars for a DVD that hasn't even been released yet?  Because this show is that good!

For those who haven't seen Kappa Mikey.  It is sort of a parody of both American and Japanese cartoons.  It pokes fun at pop-culture from both countries too.  It is quite original, clever, intelligent, and hilarious.  It is also clean fun for the whole family.  If you haven't seen the show, you should give it a chance.  Find it on Nicktoons Network.  I was skeptical about the show from the previews, but gave it a chance and instantly became a fan.",1185753600,9,676,4.4227642276422765

8207410,3,B000T28PNS,"I was surprised that this DVD only contained three episodes. It really annoys me to see DVDs for cartoon episodes that are under a full season. I guess for $9 it's not so bad, though. They do have all of Season 1 DVD in Australia for $40, but I suggest going on iTunes. The entire series is $60 ($30 per season)",1351987200,4,311,4.114754098360656
8207411,5,B000T28PNS,"I bought the video for my granddaughter; this is only 1 purchase of many from the series.  She enjoys them very much.  When she returns, she will be purchasing more.  Thanks so much and I will let her know I submitted a review.",1343692800,,227,4.232558139534884
8207412,3,B000T28PNS,"No offence to the show or quality of the DVD itself but the price just wasn't right for this one, when you read the cover it says the names of 3 episodes plus bonus material that says bonus episode how to draw and other fun things but unless they count one of the 3 mentioned episodes there is no bonus episode like I said before it's just not worth the price I'd recommend this only to big Kappa Mikey fans.",1343001600,,408,4.1125
8207413,5,B000T28PNS,"i LOVE Kappa Mikey i think its the funniest show ever! anyway, this dvd has 3 season 1 episodes which r ""Lost in Transportation"", ""Easy Come, Easy Gonard"" and the bonus episode, ""The Man Who Would Be Mikey""! it also has dvd-rom features like the Kappa Mikey wallpaper, a Kappa Mikey game and how to draw Mikey! to make this dvd even more of a must-have, it even has a music video! well, hope u get the dvd and enjoy!",1260662400,8,416,4.2125
8207414,5,B000T28PNS,I love this show just for the comedy and lack of seriousness.  I go to this show when I am having a downer day and it makes me laugh so hard I think I am going to crack a rib.,1238716800,,175,3.375
8207415,3,B000T28PNS,"Did you think this movie would be intelligent? Cute. Teen age insults/ slurs abound, but made for a younger audience that wouldn't understand the language (and you don't want them to).  Tom and Jerry is funnier.  Movie that you watch once and don't want to watch with your friends, (but it's cool to admit you own one).  Better for fullfilling that list of ""wants"" than a belly ring and just as satisfying.",1222732800,,406,4.611111111111111
