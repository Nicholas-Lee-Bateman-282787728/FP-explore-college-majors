452038,5,6302289033,"Liza Minnelli plays Mavis Turner, an ex-Broadway dancer that prepares a mismatched group of seven women and one man to perform at a charity gala.
Guaranteed to keep your feet tapping and hands clapping.
Superb cast and another unique performance by the incomparable Liza Minnelli.",1041033600,5,280,5.2444444444444445
452039,5,6302289033,"STEPPING OUT is Liza Minnelli's last big-screen feature to date, before she concentrated on her concert performances and her health started to decline.
Liza plays Mavis Turner, a has-been Broadway hoofer who now teaches tap lessons and sings in a bar in her spare time.  The charming group of misfits who all come together once a week for their tap lesson share with Mavis the joys and sadness of their lives.  When the group is asked to perform at a charity gala, they realise what the group really can accomplish.
STEPPING OUT is a blue-haired version of A CHORUS LINE, charming, poignant and occasionally heartbreaking.  The immensely-talented ensemble of actors featured represent some of the best talent in movies today.
Among the actors are seasoned veteran Broadway performers Ellen Greene, Jane Krakowski and Bill Irwin, along with Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy and legendary Shelley Winters and Julie Walters.
Liza shows us her stuff in some great dance numbers, while her vocal prowess is also given time to shine.
A memorable film and very inspirational, STEPPING OUT is a great old-fashioned, feel-good movie.",988502400,29,1124,5.164835164835165
452040,3,6302289033,"It's a shame that many think this could be the last Liza movie ever made. It's a small film, slightly flawed, that serves as a showcase for Liza and her dancing abilities. Her supporting cast is unremarkable, with the exception of Shelley Winters. The plot line strays every time Liza is out of the picture. But, it's a likeable movie that will make you want to take tap dancing lessons.  Let's just hope that Liza gets better soon, so she can come back to the big screen",985651200,4,471,4.413793103448276
452041,4,6302289033,"This is one of the best ""feel good"" films on the market today.  It was sorely under-rated and Liza should have recieved major kudos for it!  If you like to smile this is the best film for you.",968198400,4,192,4.026315789473684
452042,5,6302289033,"This is a film that truly reminds you that they just don't make 'em like they used to.
I recently rediscovered this film only a couple of months ago when a local video store was selling off some of their old stock. I had  been a part of the stage version a year before, and had found the story to  be heart warming and charming.
And the film is much the same...truly a  forgotten gem of a film that will bring a smile to your face. Of special  note are Shelly Winter's wonderful comic moments, and Liza's amazing dance  segments. This film appears to capture Liza in the last of her great  years...before her health slipped away from her. In this film, she will  take your breath away with her rich voice and sublime dance skill.
Most  of all, this film will take you back to the golden days of movie musicals,  and remind you that they don't make 'em like they used to.",957139200,15,870,4.2560975609756095
452043,5,6302289033,"Actually, this film did receive a theatrical release, in October 1991. It was originally supposed to have been released in April 1991 to benefit from the great publicity Liza was getting with her smash stage show  ""Stepping Out at Radio City."" However, Paramount, for reasons  still unknown, delayed the release.
""Stepping Out"" was Liza's  first movie since the twin disasters ""Rent A Cop"" and  ""Arthur 2"" in 1988. Paramount unwisely pushed the film as a star  vehicle. In many ways it is, but it is also an ensemble piece, and could  have benefitted from sneak previews and more focused buzz. When Paramount  finally released it, they platformed it in NY and LA and the initial  results apparently panicked the studio. They more or less pulled the plug  on any significant advertising, and the movie lasted about four weeks  total. It received scattered dates across the country thereafter, but never  truly a wide release. ""Stepping Out"" had been a modest success in  Britain months earlier, even garnering a British Academy Award nomination  for the hilarious  Julie Walters (she deserved one here too). I've always  regretted Paramount's handling of the movie; it is truly an audience  picture (""Rocky"" meets ""A Chorus Line"") and some savvy  nurturing could have produced a hit, not to mention a resurrected Minnelli  movie career.
So I agree with the guy below who said this should have  been a hit. I was at the premiere and everyone thought this would put Liza  back on top in films. Alas, it was not to be. But this is her third best  movie, after ""Cabaret"" and ""The Sterile Cuckoo."" And it  is finding new life on video, it seems.",956275200,12,1639,4.820143884892087
452044,4,6302289033,"Its ashame,but no one will give Liza a break. This film went right to Video when it was released. I rented this movie and showed it to my friends who are not Liza Minnelli fans,they Loved it. This shouldn't have been a mega  hit,but a nice small film that makes you fill good inside. Everyone in the  Movie is great,and the tap dancing wants you to start taking tap dancing  lessions while your watching the film. Liza was having a great comeback at  this time. She was breaking records touring with ""Stepping out""and  never looked better. If this happens to be the last Liza Minnelli film,it  would be a fantastic last movie from one of the greatest entertainers ever.",953942400,5,669,4.579831932773109
452045,5,6302289033,"As a dance teacher, I found this movie to be an lovely  statement to all that is positive about dance and the benefit of dance class for everyone.  The lives of the dancers in this movie were all enhanced by their dance  experience. For those who are adult and want the dance experience in their  lives, this movie covers it all. It is funny, and sad and encouraging and  educational.  I would like to think that this movie also speaks to those  who have always wanted to dance but were afraid to try. This movie will  give them hope and courage to try and find the joy for themselves. Liza  Minelli does not over power the cast. As the star she is, you watch as the  story unfolds and the musical dances itself out.",913075200,15,716,4.276119402985074

I saw the show on the West End in the early '80s and it was fabulous. It's had many productions and won well deserved awards. This film departs from the play in places and if you have seen the original it will surprise you how well the film makers translated the English characters to Americans.
Very funny, lots of laughs.  I think this is Liza Minnelli's best screen role. Do yourself a favor and watch it with friends.",1432425600,,595,4.265486725663717

452337,5,6302289033,"I've liked this movie since the first time I saw it. The heroine has gotten her life into a bit of a mess, but she turns it around by making better choices and persevering. Her class of misfit dance students benefit from her example and help each other along the way. The dancing is great, especially Liza's solo, and even the practicing is fun to watch. There is humor and drama together, but thankfully the humor comes out on top. I'm sure women would like it better than men since it focuses on women who are in bad relationships and trying to get out.",1406937600,,555,4.346153846153846

And just when will they go to the effort to put this gem of the cinema on dvd or blue ray!  That's what I hope they do and soon.  Don't miss out on this great movie about people learning to dance and how they change and grow becoming more than teacher and class, they become extended family that reach in and grab  your heart strings.  Greatest movie of its kind that I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, by all means, do!  A real treat, and a treasure of an experience.  You'll be glad you did!

I think some of Liza's acting is a little over the top but the other characters are pretty well defined.  I bought the movie only because it is about an adult tap class full of misfits who bring it together nicely in the end. As an ancient adult misfit tapper myself, I related to some of the characters and felt a little motivated to keep trying after watching them.  Otherwise I would rent instead of buy (if you can find it)  It is not available in DVD and many of us no longer have VHS players.

It reminds me of my own dance class, right down to the one person who simply cannot get the dance step (i.e. Jeffery).

452404,5,6302289033,"I've just seen the stage play again............ yet feel that the film is deeper and more descriptive.  As I said on the UK site, I know that Richard Harris was unhappy with the re-write of his play for the film, but I think it really works.  So did every one else in the audience.

This film is  excellent.  I don't care whether the ""artistic"" critics liked it or not.  The audience loved it, I did and still do.  The acting is superb and the overall feel is of ordinary people coming to terms with the everyday struggles of life.  All of the cast are worth mention, but particular credit must go to Julie Walters as Vera, Shelley Winters as Mrs Frasier and Bill Irwin as Gregory; I'll never forget those windmills!!  Liza Minelli's shining talent is so reminiscent of her mother that it is spooky.  Fluffs a couple of lines, but that just adds to the charm.

Sequences in this film made me laugh so much it hurt - and other scenes disturbed me too; especially the Andy and Mr Pennington characters.  Nasty undertones.

This film has been grossly under-rated and unfairly panned in my view.

I think it will be regarded, in due course, as a rare gem.",1255564800,,1151,4.444976076555024
452405,5,6302289033,"This film has a poignant meaning to my life. I was born with spina-bifida and use a wheelchair to walk. I was miraculously blessed with my beautiful daughter almost 18 years ago, and when she was a toddler, this movie came on TV. She was transfixed, stood with a melting fruit-sicle in her hands and couldn't look away. Suddenly, out of the blue, she hollars ""5, 6, 7, 8!"" and stomps across the room grinning from ear to ear! Now she is a professional tap dancer who is nationally ranked and has worked with renowned choreographers like Brill Barrett and Greg Russell. She also beamed with tears when she introduced me to my childhood idol Arthur Duncan (tap dancer from Lawrence Welk show).  Watching my daughter dance is like I can dance myself, and to think it all started with this crazy little film! Liza gives a warm engaging performance not only as a hard working, down-on-her-luck tap teacher, but a vocalist, and a friend. There is an stunning ""improv"" jazz dance scene where she reprises a broadway level performance of Stepping Out. (makes me cry to watch it) Jane Krakowski now of 30 Rock fame, who is equal to any dance challenge, plays a tender young nurse coming to terms with life's disappointments. Stepping Out features an ensemble of characters including Julie Walters (Calender Girls, Harry Potter), the incredible credible Shelley Winters who is facing an unfair past-her-prime crisis, (and more) who compliment one another at every single p-k turn. Contrary to popular and mainstream belief, life isn't about perfection, it's about spirit, and dancing is about the passion you possess inside of your heart and soul.. if the body follows, it's a good day! I highly recommend Stepping Out to put in your collection and view as often as you need a good laugh, cry, revelation, or just to watch unforgettable performances. I wish I had three thumbs right now! ;)",1253404800,5,1880,4.820433436532507

452417,2,6302289033,"Liza Minelli is such a brilliantly expressive actor and dancer, that she can overcome any tired cliche that's thrown at her (starting with the title of this film), and this one has cliches that weren't even cliches in 1991. She's so great in every scene that the viewer forgets that the talents of Andrea Martin, for example, are wasted. Wasted. Shelley Winters gets a slightly better chance to show her skills, as the wizened, retired theatre exponent who nonetheless plays piano part-time for the troupe, almost *defiantly* lousy. (But at the big show, there she is in the orchestra pit!).
Yes, men are beasts throughout this early-era militant feminist flick. The only non-beast is the solitary xy-entity in the class, a sissified straight guy, badly acted and terrifically danced by Bill Irwin.
Liza plays a very talented but luckless dancer, good enough to be a successful understudy for a Broadway musical, but with a seven year period of rejection. She moves on to teaching dance during the day and singing in boyfriends' sorta jazz-rock group at night. Talkin' 'bout ""beasts"", this dude is a real sullen one; he's splittin' for the coast despite his lady's committment to a charity and the discovery that he's gonna be a daddy. As much as Irwin overacts, this guy is like some Kris Kristofferson wannabe, without the cigarettes and major chords. Amazing how the progressive, independent, intellectual Mavis (LM) has hooked up with this downbeat, self-absorbed bar band legend. She looks him straight in the eye and says, most demonstratively, she may or may not let the child be born, anyway. She'll telephone him when she works that part out. Her charity seems to extend to raising money for groups of people but not extending the gift of life to one. That's her Constitutional right...but it's a depressing turn in the character development for this plotline.
Another bad guy is the violent husband of another dancer, a meek, peaceful soul who works her heart out for the homeless, but somewhere along the way married a class-A humiliator, and over-rated Corporate climber. He shows up at the benefit to rip his wife away from the proceedings - but her meek male counterpart, Irwin, throws a punch at this guy...and he ducks away. Earlier, she established that the answer to a horrible marriage is to filander with the dancing partner. Interesting.
The movie spends alot of time with the back-stories of the dancers - a la ""A Chorus Line"" - and not enough with the actual footwork. How in the heck could they get that great with Shelley playing ""chopsticks"" in three tempos all day. And why wasn't she relegated to part-time receptionist [no sexism intended] when Irwin demonstrates a boogie woogie piano style that would turn Jerry Lee Lewis' head? No, no - we'll stick with Shelley and the play-by-numbers.
Okay, if we're gonna keep our shaky keyboardist, how can we polish our act? She's not exactly resourceful on the 88s. The film should have spent some kind of time on how these amateurs delt with *that* challenge.
In the end, we have the kind of Hollywood Musical that Liza Minelli's Mother and friend/co-worker Mickey Rooney excelled at. And the finale does have that ""feel good"" feeling - but coming from the dancing, from teamwork, not from assertions of independence.
And we have an added element to the big finale - Mavis gave birth! She didn't abort the child because she was too busy being a humanitarian!!",1204156800,,3431,4.896907216494846

452422,5,6302289033,"""Stepping Out"" is a very entertaining movie. I wish they would release this movie on DVD. I have watched my VHS of ""Stepping Out"" so much that I have just about warn it out.

This movie draws you into a story about a group of people who are taking a tap dancing class. As the movie progresses, you get to know and love each of these characters.

The tap dance class is invited to perform for a fund raising event that will include some of the best dance classes and performers in Buffalo, New York (where this story takes place). They are the hit of the show and the mistakes they make are thought to be intentional as part of the act. The audience loves them and asks them to return the following year.

Liza Minelli is great in this movie and her talent to act, sing and dance are emphasized in the film. I love the character she portrays. Shelley Winter is great as the fiesty piano player for the tap dancing class.

I would recommend this movie to anyone. Very entertaining, with a touch of compassion and heart. The movie ends with Liza singing and then the members of her class join her in a big tap dancing number. A very upbeat, feel good ending!",1146528000,7,1155,4.308755760368664
452423,4,6302289033,"Liza Minnelli, Shelley Winters, Carol Woods, Bill Irwin and numerous other equally talented actors put on an endearing, convincing and just plain fun to watch performance in Stepping Out. According to Liza, the actors had to work really hard to do this--and it shows! They learned to tap dance professionally eight hours a day for five weeks, six days a week and man, how they were able to make it look so easy in the film!

Minnelli plays the leader of a somewhat amateurish older group of performers who struggle from the word go to put on a good performance at a Buffalo theater. (In actuality the movie was filmed in Toronto.) They hustle really fast and despite some infighting they get it all together at practically the last minute--but when they see the Buffalo theater man how they get goosebumps!

I wasn't really expecting much from this film; as time has passed it really isn't remembered as well as Cabaret, New York, New York and Arthur as being a great vehicle for Liza Minnelli. Man, was I wrong! They all did great and the dancing scenes truly are works of art that help the plot continue ever so smoothly at the same time. The emotional story with its somewhat predictable ending is something you'll watch again and again. I don't want to be a plot spoiler; but obviously if you look at the cover art of the video you can pretty much already tell it's not a tragedy--they succeed despite tackling some meaningful life issues and obstacles and they share their giftedness with their audience.

The only diappointment was the lack of extras that we are all so commonly used to these days when we purchase a copy of a movie on DVD.

I recommend this movie for Liza fans as well as fans of great dance and theater. It's also an uplifting and inspiring story of what real people can do when their backs are to the wall and they truly focus in order to succeed.",1145232000,8,1873,4.5325443786982245
452424,5,6302289033,"I just watched this film again for the umpteenth time and I still love it.  It is a true showcase for Liza Minelli's singing and dancing talents and with a stellar cast; especially the wonderful Julie Walters, Tony-winner Bill Irwin, not to mention Shelly Winters, who is a hoot as Glenda Frazer.  I hope this will someday be produced on DVD because I'm afraid I may wear out my VHS version soon.  It's a real shame that this movie went unnoticed by mostly everyone.  It is truly a ""feel-good"" movie and I highly recommend it.",1118188800,2,526,4.505263157894737
452425,3,6302289033,"Stepping Out is a really good film involving 7 adult women (and 1 man) tap dancers, their instructor, Mavis Turner, and their pianist who plays their music they tap to. The story is all about Mavis Turner and her tappers who only tap for fun, but then they soon land a spot in one of the biggest charity convensions shows around, while also dealing with problems like pregnancy, finances, employment, and abuse. The plot was pretty good, and there was some humor too which was good. The dancing was preety good, considering they were older. I am a tap dancer myself, and had over 10 years of experience, and overall, the quality and difficulty of the steps just wasn't there. However, the film was entertaining and enjoyalbe. I recommend this one!",1057276800,5,747,4.709923664122138
