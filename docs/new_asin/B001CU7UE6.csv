8289519,4,B001CU7UE6,"This is a good movie especially if your a fan of good fellas, Donald Sutherland is great as jimmy burke, his accent was right on point! this movie concentrates on the luftansa heist and what happens after as the crew starts to self destruct! This movie also shows the fake-loyalties associated with working with the mafia, after the gambino family found out how much money was really stolen they decided they wanted it all! Jimmy really seemed to care about his crew, a quality not often seen in the mob, too bad they all had to get wacked out!! All in all a nice story line on a different take as to what happened after luftansa, a must have if you collect mafia movies....",1303948800,3,674,4.443548387096774
