4285589,1,B0047VOCT8,"Upon seeing this movie at the local Family Video, I thought that this movie would be similar to that of 1976's movie `Grizzly' in some way.  After putting in to watch the movie, the start of it seemed to have some kind of promise to it at the start of it.  Once it got to a point in the movie it seemed like that the bear was introduced a little too early possibly in this movie and wasn't expecting it to be around another 10 minutes later for it to make its appearance.  There is one thing that seems to be a little out of place though with this movie that I have noticed while watching the movie.  That was after the bear started attacking it seems like that the people trapped in the van were able to push it back on the tires with just four ordinary people, even when there was only two people left as well.

Another thing that seemed to bug me was that this movie while it seemed like it had the premise of `Grizzly' (1976), but watching it, it seemed to be like that of Cujo but with a bear instead of a rabid St. Bernard.  Though I don't expect much from a `B' movie or even if this was a lower class movie, it seemed like that it didn't take much to make this movie let alone making it seem a little more realistic in some way.  While it's only 82 minutes long, don't seem like a long time for a movie like this but maybe it's best that it isn't that long.  Overall I think that this movie could've been better and I give it 1.5 stars out of 5.",1286582400,,1453,4.020833333333333
4285590,2,B0047VOCT8,"Okay, Cujo was a dog gone wrong, while this bear merely wanted revenge for the killing of his mate.  But the rest of it seems more like what I wrote as my review title, with some drama thrown in:  brother vs. brother and so on.",1312416000,,227,4.022222222222222
4285591,1,B0047VOCT8,"This is more of a class D movie for ""Don't Buy"".The entire movie focuses on 4 people inside of a mini van and a bear that comes out of the same bushes from time to time to attack the people. At the end of the movie,the woman says sorry and the bear lets her live. The bear finally gets in the driver seat of the mini van so that it can try and drive home. The acting and background music was very lame. The ""Edge"" with Anthony Hopkins is a good bear movie and worth buying.",1312329600,2,473,3.9375
4285592,5,B0047VOCT8,"Bear is a very good movie, full of action and unexpected scenes. I love this movie and would recommend! You will love this movie as well...do not let the cover or title fool you, this movie is full of secrets and action. Very pleased.",1303257600,2,234,4.340909090909091
4285593,1,B0047VOCT8,"Two couples jockeying for the cover of ""Too Stupid to Live"" Magazine decide to take a detour through a remote stretch of California forest. In no time their mini-van gets a flat. A grizzly bear wanders nearby. One of them panics, whips out a handgun, and unloads an entire clip into it. Mama bear arrives to find her cub dead. Now these four have to contend with a bigger, meaner, angrier bear with divine retribution on her mind, and they have no means to defend themselves since numbnuts already pumped all his bullets into the younger bear.

Bear is rather bare bones plot-wise and almost as simplistic as its title. There is only so much you can do with a cast of four, a wrecked mini-van, and a live bear in a small section of woodland.

The crux of the non-bear related drama centers around a successful stockbroker older brother constantly belittling his partying kid brother to give up his pipe dream of becoming a famous rock musician in favor of getting a real job, and while he's at it, he might want to consider getting a girlfriend that's more marriage material (that last part won't be an issue for very long). For a while there it seemed like these two brothers were in a race to see who could be the bigger jerk.

Bear wastes almost no time getting right to these four broken down and trapped in their mini-van under siege by a pissed off bear. Entertaining enough; yet, the dilemma I found myself facing was whether or not I was supposed to be rooting for the people or the bear. Mama bear is right to be enraged, and all four initially came across as obnoxious yokels for whom grisly death would be doing the world a favor.

Let's sample some of the actual dialogue during the first half of their bear attack ordeal.

""Go! Go! Go! Go!""
""Come on!""
""Move! Move! Move!""
""That's a big bear!""
""Shhhhhhhhh!""
""Did you hear that?""
""What are you doing?""

There were moments where I realized what a remake of William Girdler's Grizzly would sound like if written by Rob Zombie.

This quartet's poor decision-making skills also left me wanting to slap my forehead. They had an opportunity to ram the bear to death with their vehicle as it was pressed against a tree, swiping at one of them that had climbed up to get away, but instead they just back the car up to the tree close enough for the person to jump down onto the roof to safety. Minutes later, now inside the wrecked mini-van the bear just toppled over before heading off to take a smoke break or something, the chance to flag down a passing truck is missed because these dolts try to get the driver's attention by staying inside the trashed car yelling and beating on the insides making muffled noises rather than actually getting out to flag the motorist down. After all of this has occurred, they're remarkably casual about their predicament until 'Smokey the Death Wish Bear' comes back to get the job done.",1301616000,5,2878,4.533718689788054
4285594,2,B0047VOCT8,This movie was stupid. There's so many flaws it's rediculous. I don't even think this will ever be on TV. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because its more funny than scary.,1298764800,2,177,4.085714285714285

4285596,3,B0047VOCT8,"Those scenes that feature the live bear are the main reason to watch this movie. The bear is the best actor of the bunch.

The script isn't very good. There's a lot of contrived animosity between the characters in this movie. That sort of fabricated conflict has become a common way of generating drama in Grade B projects. But the unrelieved carping and criticizing that goes on here, especially between the two brothers, is more tedious than usual. The more successful brother keeps up a stream of disapproval of his younger brother's lack of ambition and earning capacity. However everyone is so unpleasant to each other that it's hard to care what happens to any of the humans in this movie.

Only the bear is a sympathetic character. He makes us root for nature on the rampage here. With that deserved victory at stake, the movie held my interest - bear-ly.",1294358400,,862,4.701986754966887
4285597,5,B0047VOCT8,"Rented this at my local Redbox not expecting too much and was really surprised with how fun and entertaining this movie was!  An angry grizzly seeks revenge on a bunch of dumb city slickers looking for a short cut through the woods.  I don't know if anyone remembers OPEN WATER (divers attacked by a shark), but this is like OPEN WATER with a bear!!!  If you are looking for some fun, mindless entertainment, check this one out!!!",1292284800,3,430,4.558441558441558
4285598,2,B0047VOCT8,"Bear is about what you would expect for most Redbox flicks.  Low budget, not especially original, but with a few redeeming qualities.

Bear is the story of two young couples stranded in a minivan in the California wilderness.  They are attacked by a vicious grizzly bear with a motive to kill.  But as night creeps on, the victims begin to deal with another problem: their own dark secrets.

The good news is that the scenery makes for some decent visuals.  The film was shot in a California forest, and first time director John Rebel has a decent eye for nature scenes.  And kudos to the crew for helping to rebuild that forest when it was destroyed in an unrelated wildfire after filming.

The bad news is that the film is extremely low budget.  It's plagued with bad lighting and lots of weak dialogue.  A real grizzly is used for most shots not involving people, but a laughably bad costume is used for closeups.  While I did find the movie's ""personal secrets"" angle to be actually interesting, it still doesn't change the fact that Bear is basically a ""Cujo"" ripoff.

John Rebel is a first-time director, working with a shoestring budget.  That being said, you have to cut Bear some slack, don't expect a natural horror flick like Jaws.  I would definitely say that you shouldn't buy the DVD until you get a chance to rent it through Redbox first.",1291075200,10,1353,4.606694560669456

8418405,1,B0047VOCT8,"The movie wasn't that bad in the in the beginning, except for the fact that I seriously doubt that bears have flashbacks (the scene where he thinks about the cub getting shot). While, I believe a bear will fight for its young, I doubt it will go away and keep coming back the way this bear did. When bears kill they don't usually drag people around (like he did to the first girl), they just kill them. The part where the bear follows the brother to the restaurant and drags him back about a couple of miles instead of killing him was just ridiculous, in fact, it was so crazy that the actor playing the younger brother (Brendan Michael Coughlan) almost busted out laughing at the thought. After being drug back to the vehicle, the older brother states he saw their parents, but clearly in the scene he only made it to his white Porsche before the bear came out. So, the bear followed him about two miles or less, after seeing him in parking lot let him see his parents (why he didn't get the parents attention, I don't know), then dragged back him to the car for the others to see him die. But he didn't die then, he had to find out about his brother and wife's affair. And if he could run to the restaurant then they could have been out of there. And when he ran to the restaurant it was late, so the parents were still there, they were driving in the early part of the day. And the bear can sneak up on people without them hearing, yes a 500ILBS bear can apparently hold his breath(not making his usual grunting noises) and creep up on people in this movie. The ending was horrible, I mean the bear didn't kill her because she apologized. Really ? Speaking of talking to the bear, it was just goofy that the older brother would be cursing and threatening a bear.
The shooting of the movie could have been better, you can see the guy with the fake bear claw on his hand in one of the shots. You could tell it was a bear suit in many cases. The parts that work are when the characters are talking about their problems, not the so-called scary parts, because they aren't scary. They could have avoided the whole situation. Brendan Michael Coughlan is cute and I hope he gets better movies than this in the future.",1408665600,2,2213,4.309352517985611

This movie also brought back my great grandmother, but unfortunately she was a zombie...so I had to kill her. But hey, I highly recommend this product as a cure for all your illnesses, regardless.

This movie deserves more stars and I'm sad to see that isn't possible. Amazon needs to get on that. If you're an aspiring filmmaker, this is the movie to watch! The action, the gore, the romance, the comedy, the suspense, and the slightly pornographic scenes will make all you aspiring filmmakers excited. 10/10 would watch forever.",1382486400,2,658,4.721739130434782
8418408,3,B0047VOCT8,"""Bear"" (2010) is a low-budget nature-runs-amok flick in the manner of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prey/dp/B000JJRYDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prey</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Water/dp/B0017806DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Water</a>."" Like those films, the plot is simple and the location confined. The plot consists of four people, a mini-van and an attacking bear, that's it. The location is the mini-van and the surrounding desert-like forest, that's it. A third shortcoming is that -- except for the first eight minutes -- the entire film takes place at night! (Thankfully, you can clearly see what's going on throughout).

On the positive side, the story does stress characterization. In fact, the film gets increasingly more soap operatic as it moves along. On top of this is a very dramatic score along the lines of, say, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" and all the actors give it their best shot.

The film was shot in Angeles National Forest near Acton, CA, about an hour drive from Topanga State Park near Malibu, where ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Hunters/dp/B0007OCG6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch Hunters</a>"" was filmed. As such, there are some similarities: Both films involve a group of people being attacked by a large forest creature (or creatures), both take place in the same general vicinity, both have long stretches of night sequences, and both feature very dramatic scores. Regardless, ""Sasquatch Hunters"" is the better film, by far, because the plot and locations aren't one-dimensional. Another similar film is ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Skies-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000KF0GT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Skies (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" because it also has a thin plot and the same general location (Santa Clarita), but like ""Sasquatch Hunters"" ""Night Skies"" is the better film simply because it's not as limited in scope (take, for instance, the excellent ending to ""Night Skies"").

At 82 minutes this is a short film, but like ""Prey"" and ""Black Water"" it's sometimes hard to sit through just because it's so one-dimensional. Fortunately, the character dramatics, the score and the REAL bear tend to hold your attention, but just barely.

Despite its shortcomings, you have to respect director John Rebel because in many ways this is a respectable film made on a very small budget with a real bear and worthy actors. He did the best he could with what he had and it's a well-made movie, albeit one-dimensional and micro-budget.

Some might understandably complain that some parts of the story are highly unrealistic. For instance, one of the members of the party leaves the rest at the mini-van to get help. He hikes for at least a couple of miles where he encounters civilization and also the bear, which drags him all the way back to the mini-van! How did the bear drag him back to the vehicle? Did he have his leg in his maw or what? How come the guy showed no signs of serious injury from being dragged in such a manner for a couple of miles through hilly, forested terrain?

Because of this, I don't think the film's really about the bear attack; it's only this on the surface. So what's it really about? This is a story about the serious conflict of two brothers and their babes. One appears to be successful and happily married while the other is a struggling rock musician hoping to make it big. Appearances aren't always reality and many truths surface during the engagement with the bear. Will these awful truths further separate them or ultimately bring them together? Will they even survive?

FINAL WORD: The thin plot and confined-location of ""Bear"" are a huge detriment, but it has some positive qualities that make it worthwhile, like the emphasis on characterization and the dramatic score. If you have a taste for films like ""Prey,"" Black Water"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B004HY88BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>"" then you'll probably appreciate it, although it's the least of these.
