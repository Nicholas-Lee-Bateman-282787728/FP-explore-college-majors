7946659,2,B00005NB9T,"The first part of the movie is really enjoyable, Penelope Cruz as beautiful as ever, but by the time that the parts of the young lovers are taken over by the mature actors, these characters become not so likable, she for being so selfish and manipulative and him for being such a sap.
And I can not see how Penelope could ""grow"" to look like the other actress, I found her features rather unatractive, but beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and Penelope's is hard to match.
If you are not fluent in Spanish, beware, the titles are very small and white, very difficult to read, at times impossible.
For Penelope's fans, but remember, she is only in half the movie!",1274400000,,667,4.430894308943089
7946660,4,B00005NB9T,"This movie has a great soundtrack, and follows an interesting progression from the Spain of the 1960s to the present. There are a number of scenes in which historical figures or events form an inconsequential backdrop to the storyline. The movie is supposed to be a decades-long love story between two people from very different backgrounds that never end up together, but at times it seems more like the story of an ambitious and not-too-likable woman. This is born out in the ending which portrays more of her ambition rather than a romantically satisfying conclusion. There is also an odd transition from younger actors to older actors that do a good job but don't necessarily seem like they look quite right as older versions of the same people. If you are interested in a Penelope Cruz movie, there are better choices. She appears as the younger version of the main character for less than half of the film and isn't very likable.",1215475200,,935,4.777777777777778
7946661,3,B00005NB9T,"Two young people meet in the 60's as a result of their devotion to John Lennon, and have a recurring relationship during the next thirty years at the oddest of moments, in the most diverse places, and during very important moments that defined several decades. Pay attention as one couple of younger actors alternate with the other couple of older actors to recreate this 30 year span in this Spanish-French comedy.

7946663,3,B00005NB9T,"This film is a romanitic comedy about a couple whose relationship consists of a sequence of chance and planned encounters beginning in the sixties.  It is a conventional tale, well executed.  The passage of time requires two sets of actors, both well chosen.  The music and settings quite nice.  There are a few silly scenes, but overall it is a good movie for a quiet evening.

  Only complaint - the production seems to be made for Spanish television.  The picture quality is not great, and the subtitles are small, white, and often unreadable.",1110844800,,546,4.795698924731183
7946664,3,B00005NB9T,"Written and directed by Manuel Gmez Pereira in 1996, LOVE CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH is a spanish comedy presented by Vanguard in its original widescreen version with english subtitles. Only a trailer as bonus feature.
Santi and Diana first met under John Lennon's bed in Madrid while the Beatles were giving a press conference in a 5 star hotel. Over the years, the couple will meet again a number of times but their life together will not exceed a full week in a 30 years period. Santi and Diana are madly in love but who knows whether their love would have lasted so long if they had the opportunity to live together.
Four actors playing two characters, a couple of eccentric secondary parts and a few really hilarious scenes could persuade you to buy or rent this DVD. I've liked very much the first part of the movie that gives to Penlope Cruz the opportunity to create the character of a young hysterical Beatles fan. The director perfectly recreates the 60's with tricks that could have appeared in Robert Zemeckis' FORREST GUMP or Woody Allen's ZELIG.
The second part of the movie lacks of the energy distillated by Penlope and Gabino Diego. In my opinion, with 30 minutes less, the movie would have been a perfect romantic comedy. But LOVE CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH still is a very good surprise for the curious movie lover lost in the wide choice of the available DVD's.

7946665,4,B00005NB9T,"sta es una apariencia divertida en la infidelidad.  Penelope Cruz (Diana) es bella, como siempre.  El director recrea unas pocas escenas de viejas pelculas romnticas para ayudar a hacer esta historia. T podras comenzar a pensar en amores que t tuviste en el pasado. La pelcula es un poco largo. La banda sonora de msica acrecienta el romanticismo.  Me gusta el uso de los Beatles en la historia - te ayude a entender la referencia de tiempo de la pelcula.  Ve la pelcula con tu cario.  T no puedes remover los subttulos de la pelcula, desafortunadamente.",1008979200,9,554,4.729166666666667
