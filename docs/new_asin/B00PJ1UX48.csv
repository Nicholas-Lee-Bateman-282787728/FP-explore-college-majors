8688197,5,B00PJ1UX48,"This is still my most favorite ""30 for 30"" film.  The setting of this story couldn't be more perfect:  A present day visit to a storage room for Brian and his son where he unlocks his time capsule to tell us his story.  The story goes beyond football, as we discover that he Brian was also one of the first marketable and the most unique individuals in college sports history.  He also dwells on many things that he would change if he had to do it all over again.  Don't feel ashamed if you can manage a tear or two towards the end of the film.",1448668800,,544,4.09433962264151

8688203,5,B00PJ1UX48,"Tells the story of Brian Bosworth the great football player, but he becomes a caricature of himself. Has daddy issues. He retells the story to his son as they revisit his past at a storage facility.

He says too much and publication of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boz/dp/0385247478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boz</a>&nbsp;does him no favors. He goes to Seattle for a brief career where he feels he was a bust. Is able to find some success in 'Stone Cold'. Players, coaches, and announcers comment. Insightful. Aspires for redemption.",1436054400,,588,6.0843373493975905
