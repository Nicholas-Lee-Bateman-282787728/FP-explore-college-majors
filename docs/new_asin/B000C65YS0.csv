2452890,3,B000C65YS0,"Both movies on this DVD are entertaining and stand on their own merits, but the reason I bought this was to see Raise the Titanic again.  Like many fans of this movie, I look forward to a restored/enhanced/widescreen treatment one day.  Although this is not it, I was appreciative of the fact that the movie looks acceptable on this DVD.  It's fullscreen with widescreen credits, no real cleanup as evident by a moderate degree of speckling and faded color, and weak stereo audio with limited range.  But at least it isn't as low as the quality of the GoodTimes series of DVD releases.  For the price, this was acceptable, and it was nice to see this movie again.  In the meantime, I still look forward to seeing an enhanced widescreen version someday.

As far as Man Friday, same comments.

Both are enjoyable movies with excellent acting and great stories.  And with the low price, very worth the purchase even for basic fullscreen copies.

Now get to work on the enhanced versions please.",1138406400,36,991,4.709302325581396

2452907,5,B000C65YS0,"Raise The Titanic is based on the Clive Cussler novel of the same name. This is a great popcorn movie. Apparently there is a box full of an extremely rare mineral called Byzanium aboard the Titanic and this mineral is needed to create an inpregnable missile shield over the United States. The Navy is brought in to formulate a plan to raise the Titanic in order to get the mineral.

There are two wonderful scenes in the movie, the first is when, after decades on the bottom of the sea, the Titanic breaks the surface. The second scene i.e. when the Titanic is towed into New York harbor. The movie doesn't end there. All that I will say at this point is that we still have to deal with Russian agents. Terrific movie to watch and own.",1421884800,,735,4.364963503649635

2452915,5,B000C65YS0,"MAN FRIDAY is an excellent take on the Robinson Crusoe story, as told through the eyes of Crusoe's servant, Friday.

I remember renting this film 25 years ago when I was going to school in New York, and it is as good today as it was back then.  O'Toole (as Crusoe) is at his passionate best, whether flying into a fury, going nearly mad, getting deeply reflective and grief-filled, or prancing through the many whimsical, comic moments in the film.  Watching him in this film made me imagine what his Hamlet on stage must have been like, because Hamlet runs the same gamut of emotions that Crusoe does in this film.  Roundtree (as Friday) is fantastic, too, and plays off O'Toole extremely well, matching his mood, scene for scene, whether serious or comic.

I kept asking myself while watching the film, why wasn't this a bigger hit, especially in the mid-70's when it came out?  Seems to me a perfect reflection on what was going on socially in the country back then--an examination of who the real ""savage"" is.  The only answer I could think of was it was probably like Dustin Hoffman's ""Ishtar""--a fine movie that was before its time, and people just ""didn't get"".

Anyway, well, WELL worth the purchase, especially to diehard O'Toole fans, who will LOVE seeing him in one of the many brilliant performances of his distinguished career.",1393200000,,1340,4.721030042918455

There are negatives................of course the wreck was found five years later and it was confirmed it broke up before sinking, but to me the worst error was the trumpet...............the band on the Titanic was strings only..............oh well, I am glad I bought the dvd for those three scenes I mentioned.",1335312000,,901,5.171232876712328

I have a copy of the UK release of the film and although its in widescreen, the colors are very washed-out and the undersea photograph to dark to really understand what is going on.

Raise the Titanic has a great score, and wonderful cast, if u are into sunken ship wrecks, then u will like this film, the story itself is a little dull and u don't see the ship raise until towards the end of the film, im not certain as to why the writers felt they could pull this story off as the ship itself broke in two peices when it sank.

However early films before james camerons Titanic, such as a Night to Remember always showed the Titanic sinking entirely as one complete vessel. When i saw this film in the 80's i didn't know titanic had broken in two.",1314921600,,748,4.1875

It was lousy!  Made in the 70s with an obvious 70s feel to it (which was tolerable), but the actor portraying Dirk Pitt was wrong, his portrayal of Dirk Pitt was wrong, there was very little action although the novel was filled with it, they didn't tie up plot lines, etc.  In short, it was terrible.  There's another movie on the same disk, ""Man Friday."" I have no idea what it is about, but I'll give it a shot and see if it's worth keeping the disk, although I doubt it.

2452929,4,B000C65YS0,"...that Raise the Titanic was written and filmed before we knew the actual condition of the ship....Like most, I got this for RTT because it has always had sentimental value for me from my childhood, and frankly it is an entertaining film. The godawful tripe that Hollywood has been pumping out for over a decade now only raises the street value of films like this, I believe; films that were made with a firm dedication to the project and not part of some mass production line of throwaway, soulless garbage like today.
I doubt I will ever watch Man Friday, but as far as RTT goes it does appear rather aged on this release. Sadly, no special treatment has been given to it.
But no matter. There is no less of an emotional impact now to watch the ship break the surface than there ever was. Sure, some shots are sickeningly revealing of the miniature ship that was used, but by god that overhead shot in the sunlight--the one also used for the ending credits--looks as authentic as the real deal. How anyone couldn't feel a tug at their heart when seeing Titanic towed into New York at long last....Just unbelievable. Interesting storyline, as well.

I go out a year or two later and see the movie they made out of the book and it too was great because, well, they weren't exactly doing too much with The Titanic back in 1980 anyways.....

I go out a few years later when I got my first VCR and purchased the VHS version of RAISE THE TITANIC and it was Awesome because it was right around the time Ballard found the real one but yet was disappointed to find out that the movie wasn't exactly accurate because Cussler had the ship in one piece but who knew????........

What's the matter with the company?, they busting chops or something?, they can't get a license to put it out on REGION 1 all by itself?, come on people, this is the 21st century, we put a man on the moon, we can fit tons of info on a chip the size of a pinhead, they put out far inferior movies they have no business putting out before this one on DVD and we can't get the movies we want on DVD, this just isn't right.",1228521600,,1455,4.109154929577465

This was a big screen film and deserves better than the pan and scan it got.  While I realize that Clive Cussler absolutely hated this movie, I've always found it a good fun ride.  It's been decades since I read the novel so I can't recall what liberties were taken.  History, of course, has rendered it all moot as the Titanic did not sink in one piece.  As John Milius written prologue for THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JUDGE ROY BEAN  said: ""Maybe it's not the way it really was.  It was the way it should have been.""  Frankly, I liked Richard Jordan.  I thought he was well suited to the role -- also a stand out in LOGAN'S RUN and a made for tv production written by Stirling Silliphant (IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, ROUTE 66) THE FRENCH ATLANTIC AFFAIR based on a novel by Ernest Lehman.

2452969,5,B000C65YS0,"I purchased this DVD primarily to get a copy of RAISE THE TITANIC in this format. It is not the best transfer of this film. Some scenes are grainy and the stereo sound is right on the fringe of even being called stereo. However there are stereo elements there and you will just have to play with your receiver to maximize the effect.  I threw the sounds through my rear speakers to achieve the best effect I could manage. However, I like RAISE THE TITANIC and this copy is actually very viewable and I can recommend it as the best DVD copy out there at this time designed for Region 1. Just savor the moment.

There is something about RAISE THE TITANIC that continues to draw me to it. If I were unbiased I know that this is not one of the best films ever made and is probably not even considered a good film by many. However, beyond two scenes that I actually consider good filmmaking, there is a hokey but appealing quality to this film that I cannot seem to shake. I still remember the first time I saw RAISE THE TITANIC. What impressed me most about the entire film was its prologue. It was a montage of black & white photographs depicting the construction, the launching and the setting sail of the Titanic on its maiden voyage. The montage was accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful piece of music composed by John Barry. In this short yet effective composition John Barry captured the majesty of the Titanic, the romanticism of the sea and the mystique of Britain's maritime heritage in what I consider to be one of the best pieces of film scoring that I ever heard. John Barry's score seems more inspired by the actual tragedy of the Titanic and the unknown dangers of the cold Atlantic waters. Despite the shortcomings of the film, which can probably be attributed to weak editing and not necessarily the script, John Barry's music remains focused on the ship and the sentimentality its tragedy holds for Richard Jordan and Alec Guinness. Jordan and Guinness seem to be quixotically tied to the sea. The scene where Alec Guinness reminisces over his experiences aboard the sinking of the Titanic is a haunting and beautiful piece of histrionics. Guinness' heartbreaking sentimentality as he reverently hands over to Jordan the flag he took from the sinking Titanic many years before is one of the best pieces of film I have ever seen. Alec Guinness and Richard Jordan's performances and John Barry's score in this scene are truly heartfelt renderings by these craftsmen and stand as a genuine memoriam to the actual tragedy. This scene and the prologue really touched me and for that reason I always have enjoyed this film and it remains one of my favorites.

I have not watched this film in a while and I am very impressed by Richard Jordan's performance. This man died much too young and this film almost seems like a tribute to an actor who deserved much greater recognition. He gives a performance of determination tempered with a dedication to the memory of the TITANIC and is sincerely convincing as a man of strength who has braved the elements of the cruel Atlantic yet maintains a reverence for the perils of the sea and those who succumbed to those perils.
