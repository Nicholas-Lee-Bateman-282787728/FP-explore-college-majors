8343223,5,B001U9ON0S,"The Sovereign's Servant reminds me heavily of Brotherhood of the Wolf, a French adventure movie from roughly the same era, with a mix of historical events and ""supernatural"" overtones with this Black Rider. The Chevalier also dawns the leather overcoat made popular by Brotherhood of the Wolf, and there are a few cinematography shots that reminded me of the movie, too. I say this as a compliment as Brotherhood of the Wolf is one of my favorite movies, and if you're going to homage a film, that's a good one to start with. Outside of those homages, The Sovereign's Servant stands out on it's own as a great film. It's a really fun adventure movie with beautifully crafted smallsword duels, and nicely portrayed 18th Century war techniques. This movie blew me away in terms of it's production quality, storytelling, action sequences, and cinematography. I loved it so much that I watched it twice in the same day.

Highly recommended to folks who enjoy period action-adventure movies, especially those set in Eastern Europe and during the Sun-King's era.",1417219200,2,1056,4.966101694915254
8343224,5,B001U9ON0S,"This is a spendid adventure film that takes place during the great Northern War of 1700 - 1710.  The film follows the adventures of two French aristocrats sent into exile because of dueling in the luxurious Court of Louis XIV.  One follows the fortunes of the Russians under Peter the Great, the other goes with the Swedes under Charles XII.

Those who like period action films can't go wrong with THE SOVEREIGN'S SERVANT (English language Title).  It seems to have a little bit of everything in a fast paced format.  The production value is sumptious.

The Battle of Poltava at the end of the film fought in the Ukraine in 1709 saw the finale eclipse of Sweden as a major military power and marked the emergence of Russia onto the European stage.  The battle itself is first-rate and is probably the best 18th century action piece ever put onto film.  The Swedish army is made to look a lot larger than it actually was, and there is perhaps a bit too much close combat, but the uniforms, equipment and special effects are superb.  Being that it was produced in 2009 it marks the 200th anniversary of the event.

This film should be made available in English sub-title on Amazon.  This is the best 18th Century battle scene I have ever seen and hopefully it will serve as a model for future movies of this genre.  Bug Amazon to get this title in English subs!",1319241600,4,1359,4.524590163934426
