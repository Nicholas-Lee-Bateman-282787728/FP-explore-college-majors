2252659,4,B0007YXQPA,"That title may exaggerate a little, but not too much; this film has some beautifully acted, very funny moments that actually stood out in our memories as much as the dramatic lightning storms pictured. The director, David Giancola, obviously has a deep appreciation of comedy as the comedy moments in the film are remarkably well done.

The story is family friendly and captures some very natural family situations in a small town that is facing some big challenges. There really are some outstanding comedic moments during the movie that are worth the price of admission.

The hero, a teen age boy named Eric, played by Jesse Eisenberg, makes an important discovery and no one will  believe him; the movie is the story of his rising to the occasion and taking the necessary steps to save his community.

We enjoyed it and my wife, who is not a fan of disaster movies, said it was good and we both got some really good laughs from certain scenes. This is one I think the whole family can enjoy; while it is not a great movie it is a fun movie that entertains.",1325548800,5,1059,4.557894736842106

2252661,4,B0007YXQPA,"The lightning effects are kind of bad but I think it adds charm to this movie.

The story line is an awesome father and son story. Just make sure to suspend your belief regarding the science at the end of the movie.

If you like corny and charming natural disaster movies (like Absolute Zero) then you will enjoy this movie!",1309910400,,324,4.383333333333334

2252667,5,B0007YXQPA,"This film is very good for effects from natural disasters, (lightning storms in this film) to the relationship between a father and his son. I am a big fan of John Schneider way back to his Dukes of Hazzard days, and recently brought Night Of The Twisters another natural disaster film starring John so I could not wait to get this release to. It is amazing that lightning storms like this could happen though hopefully not, and the destruction that can occur from it. The film was made in 2000 and even though it does not contain any extras it is still worth getting. So if your a John Schneider fan or a person who likes natural disaster movies then I absolutely reccomend it and buying the Night Of The Twisters DVD to.",1156377600,25,722,4.43609022556391

2252680,5,B0007YXQPA,I really enjoyed this movie.  I like films that star John Schneider.  This one is exciting to watch and had no profanity.  I just wished they made more movies that was exciting and leave out the profanity.  I have no TV because of this reason which goes to say that movies does not to have to have profanity or sex to be good.  I get the edited dvd's and watch on my computer.  The only issue I had with this film was that the resolution was not that well but was still able to watch it.  Well worth watching more than once.,1464307200,,524,4.078431372549019

2252697,5,B0007YXQPA,"One of my favorite disaster movies.  About a young boy and his dad who are always at odds.  The son is a weather buff and has discovered two terrible storms converging on their town of Rutledge.  No one will believe him except his teacher who is off trying to get his pregnant wife to the hospital, which isn't going as planned.  The kids in this movie are great as in John Schneider, I really think the casting of this movie was really well done.  I highly recommend this movie for disaster buffs.  It is one of the better disaster movies.",1425340800,,540,4.35

Too bad, but still a good fun sci fi.  I'd recommend it.  And no, I won't tell you about it.  That just spoils the story.  If you like sci fi without murder and mayhem but with a good plot, this is for you.  It's a good family film.",1416960000,,404,4.1688311688311686

2252707,5,B0007YXQPA,"Another good movie to show students in school about the relationships between father-son, student-new student, teacher-son. The protagonist, a teenage weather nut, believes a once in a lifetime storm is about to hit. Will his dad finally agree that his son does know what he's talking about and risk it all to save many? There's also a sub-plot with a chain store and the mayor--makes for interesting dynamics amongst the characters.

2252731,3,B0007YXQPA,"I am a weather junkie, love WeatherNationTV.  When I saw this, I thought, might be interesting. The characters are paper thin, no substance.  The title tells all, lightning is the star, the rest of the cast are high paid extras.  The kid who is the nerd who studies storms is our hero. The father hasn't a clue about him son's interest, he treats him as though he was infectious. I was taken aback when I saw WKRP's Gary Sandy in a bizarre role as a trouble maker. The saving grace, some good lighning shots, it's okay for the special effects.",1391558400,,543,4.41
2252732,5,B0007YXQPA,"An enjoyable movie, lots of conflict and action, suspense and a cute little teen romance. A little profaniity, but otherwise a good family film. The acting is convincing and the special effects are plenty good enough, even some humor at times too. Probably wouldn't win at the Sundance Film Festival, but I watched it at least twice (at different times) and enjoyed it both times.
