8679824,5,B00NQGRSJQ,Great Dvd. I like getting to choose how long I will stretch.,1487980800,,60,4.083333333333333
8679825,5,B00NQGRSJQ,"This is a perfectly fine yoga dvd that gives you choices of five minutes, fifteen minutes, or thirty minutes of quality yoga moves. I like this one as it is more athletic, has a more beginner feel although there are three levels to choose from that make it challenging enough, and the mystical aspects of yoga are not present if you are not in the mood for that. Didio is pleasant and gives good pointers, and all three routines are relaxing. These are good add-ons when you don't want a complex routine but you do want the flexibility and stretching benefits of yoga.",1457827200,3,568,4.524271844660194
