4286008,5,B0048CC3A6,I already own this movie on DVD but was tired of having to take the DVD & my portable DVD player when I was away from home & wanted to watch it. Now I have it available any time via my iPad.,1368230400,,190,3.5476190476190474
4286009,3,B0048CC3A6,"I enjoy watching Salman Khan's films very much because of his ability to portray the brave and romantic person who finds the woman he loves,in addition to the lovely songs,and the beautiful landscapes of India which are always present. Salman plays the role of Raju, a handsome young man who loves his childhood friend Juti and both them are determined to get married but they face some obstacles in their path when a prostitute and her ruthless brother interfere into the lives of Raju's sister and her wealthy husband who is Juti's older brother. The plot was written very well and it deserves 10 out 10 and of course,Bollywood always produces the best films that touch our souls and hearts.",1301961600,4,693,4.783333333333333
8418623,4,B0048CC3A6,"Pooja (Ashwini Bhave) marries well and brings her young brother with her.  Raju (Salman Khan) grows up into a simple man, intensely devoted to his sister and her husband, Thakur (Jackie Shroff).  The family breaks apart, however, when Raju and Thakur's sister (Rhambha) fall in love, and when Thakur becomes bewitched by a prostitute (Shweta Menon).

This is a drama focusing mainly on the bond between brother and sister, the importance of family, and how much one will risk for those he loves.  The romantic musical numbers do not fit in with Khan's role, unfortunately, and are a distraction.  The rest of the story is good, though, and is certainly a movie worth watching.",1491436800,,676,4.894736842105263

I was doing my pharmacy calculations, very boring
Play a movie to help you keep awake ;)
When you get bored, watch the movie, and keep on rocking calculations.",1459728000,,199,4.714285714285714
8418628,3,B0048CC3A6,"The opening scene where he buys a blouse for his sister when he went to the tailor to get the shirt she was asking him to buy is the most touching.  That scene brought emotion.  Then it went to the antagonist, a corrupt policeman.  I like the fight scenes.  I love the super horse who fought with them.  The rest, the women with natural hair were great but when they transformed to hair-sprayed versions it reminded me of the 1980s.  The older sister and her husband were great.  The remaining 2 hours were cheesy, I agree with other reviewer.",1445126400,,543,4.424242424242424
8418629,4,B0048CC3A6,"Cool movie. Classic Salman Khan.  Romance, classism, love vs. hate, kindness vs. cruelty and everyone who should win, wins in the end.  Love it.",1442534400,,144,4.958333333333333
