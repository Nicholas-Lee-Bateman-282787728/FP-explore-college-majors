8164454,3,B000LVEWNO,"OK, this DVD which in reality is a digital copy of an old VHS/Bata Max tape carries with it all that it implies.  Buck is out of focus most of the time and the framing and editing are at best ""crude"".  The information contained in the video is rock solid but they truly need to reshoot this with some current technology and a competent camera operator.  I found that I was starting to get a headache trying to focus in on what Buck was doing.....",1406505600,3,446,4.223529411764706
8164455,3,B000LVEWNO,"but for an ignorant like me, I cannot figure out, see or understand the exercise on this DVD. I bought the book and the book is a lot better. I quit doing it because it is so cold. I got two fillies in November and I am busy with them. I am waiting for better weather to restart again with the exercises of the book.",1358899200,2,316,3.876923076923077
