8274478,4,B0019LWYJ4,"Italian comedy ""Manuale d'amore"" consists of four loosely connected episodes about love. The theme taken up in each chapter is all familiar to us - falling in love, crisis in marriage, betrayed wife and deserted husband - but the film is benefited from the delightful turns from the actors especially Carlo Verdone as hapless husband and Margherita Buy as neglected wife.

We don't need many words to describe the content of this comedy. It begins with the Episode One about young unemployed boy Tommaso (Silvio Muccino, brother of director  Gabriele Muccino of ""The Persuit of Happyness"") chasing the beautiful girl he met in the street. Episode Two is about a married couple Marco (Sergio Rubini) and Barbara (Margherita Buy) trying to save their marriage from collapse desperately.

In Episode Three we see a female traffic officer Ornella (Luciana Littizzetto) cheated by her husband and the consequence of her outrage. Episode Four wraps up the entire film with a story about a 50-something doctor (Carlo Verdone) trying to face the fact that his wife suddenly left him without saying anything.

The film starts shakily, but gets better from the second chapter where the story really kicks in. Despite the potentially serious topic dealt here, the film's tone is light as a whole, and it sometimes almost becomes a farce with all too familiar scenes like a man hiding under the bed. This is not ""Annie Hall,"" but director Giovanni Veronesi keeps the good pace with the apt use of voiceovers, making us laugh with the characters, not at them.

This is a pleasant and funny comedy, surprising pleasure from Italy where it became a hit.",1189296000,,1638,4.963503649635037

But I strongly recommend I assure you that you will find one if not all, of the stories told in this film true to your own. LOVE IT!",1186704000,,308,4.327586206896552
