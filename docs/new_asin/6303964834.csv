7857468,4,6303964834,Not much to see in this b-movie except some nice color photography and a charming Errol Flynn performance. Essential for Flynn completists.,1500854400,,139,5.363636363636363
7857469,5,6303964834,"I have been waiting a long time to get this.  Hopefully it will be released on DVD soon.  Thankyou, very fast delivery",1467244800,,118,4.318181818181818
7857470,2,6303964834,"The producers of this film tried too hard to make this similar to the great classic film ""Casablanca.""  The heroine looks a little Scandinavian and her accent and voice are similar to Ingrid Bergman's, although she's not as pretty.  There is a sinister Sidney Greenstreet type character who lurks on the balcony.  The local inspector keeps his eye on the Errol Flynn character in the same way the local police watched Casablanca's Rick.  The lovers have a special song, ""When I Fall in Love,"" that is played on the piano by a black singer (Nat King Cole), reminiscent of Sam playing ""As Time Goes By"" in Casablanca.  It wasn't enjoyable because I kept wishing it were Casablanca.",1419984000,,679,4.769230769230769
7857471,4,6303964834,"I saw this movie for the first time today and enjoyed every bit of it.  The only actors I'm familiar with are Col. Klink from Hogans Heroes and the old guy playing Aziz (Vladamir Sokoloff) from a number of character actor roles. Maybe that's why I liked it so, I came to it with nothing to compare the main actor roles to.  Unfortunately, I only know of Errol Flynn from hearsay and his name is synonymous with swashbuckling.  This movie is anything but that.

How can you not like a movie that starts off with Nat King Cole singing ""That Song?"" The song that stays with you throughout the movie and probably the rest of your day? The technicolor and ""That Song"" set the tone for a very engrossing story about love lost and the hope for finding it again.  And if you've never been or dreamed of being in love, shame on you.

Sometimes the magic in a movie comes from not knowing the magician's secret. In other words watching as if the entire story and its actors are new and unfamiliar. Too often today we carry the ""been there done that"" attitude and miss out on some wonderful experiences. Istanbul is an experience that can take you to another time and place if given the chance.  There's an innocence about it.  It doesn't yell its intent, it whispers it.  So try not to be intruded upon while watching or you might not hear the magic.",1390435200,2,1340,4.392712550607287
7857472,5,6303964834,"Errol Flynn really was a gifted actor, not just a swashbuckler playing a role and this movie (one of his last) is proof positive. This role would have fit Tom Selllick to a T and had great reviews. My only complaint was in the lighting of the movie and I believe that this was planned. I loved this movie.",1377561600,2,305,4.186440677966102
7857473,2,6303964834,"ISTANBUL is a bizarre piece of work, starring a clearly overweight and raddled Errol Flynn as a romantic hero caught up in a web of intrigue in 1950s Istanbul. He sleepwalks through the film, a pale shadow of his former self. The locations are of interest to anyone either unacquainted with the city of Istanbul, or to those who would like to know what it looked like before the developers changed its vista forever. John Bentley, a stalwart British B-Movie actor of the mid-50s, looks uncomfortable playing a Turkish police inspector, as he should be. For aficionadoes only.",1345852800,2,575,4.877551020408164
7857474,5,6303964834,"...with shockingly old Errol Flynn, shockingly cheek-boned Cornell Borchers and shockingly young Nat ""King"" Cole.  Bought this on a whim at a yard sale and the wife and I watched it this morning over breakfast.

This 1996 re-issue of the original 1956 remake of the 1947 original ""Singapore"" version is nice but actually nothing terribly special (man gets girl and diamonds, man loses girl and hides diamonds, man finds girl and diamonds, man gets girl and loses diamonds) except for the outstanding rendition by Cole of ""When I Fall In Love.""

But it was a pleasant 85 minutes and a blast from the past.  And that song will be going through my head all day.

It's a keeper.",1241913600,4,674,4.677966101694915
7857475,5,6303964834,1957's ISTANBUL came late in Errol Flynn's career and perhaps that's why I like it. It combines Errol Flynn's tried and true histrionics now tempered with a world-weary demeanor with new cinematic filmmaking of the 1950s including Cinemascope under Joseph Pevney's taught direction and William Daniels evocatively suspenseful cinematography. I truly enjoy the more relaxed pace of this film of mystery and foreign intrigue. Unfortunately this is yet another film that failed to launch the career of Cornell Borchers (NEVER SAY GOODBYE with Rock Hudson).,1196726400,8,553,5.517647058823529
7857476,1,6303964834,I really felt sorry for Errol watching this movie. He looks so uncomfortable and doesn't seem to know what to do with his hands. Count how many times a double is used for Flynn in even the most routine shots-like  walking into a building. They hired a unit to shoot some location stuff but  didn't bother to send the cast. I'm starting to yawn just thinking about  this deadly dull waste of time. Nat King Cole is great for 5 minutes  in  Technicolor but the rest of the picture stinks.,960422400,6,486,4.355555555555555
7857477,2,6303964834,"Possibly in an attempt to give this sad little epic a ""Casablanca"" flavor, Nat Cole sings ""When I Fall in Love"" about sixteen times, while bleary-eyed Errol Flynn tries to get  a bead on lost-yet-not-quite-lost love, gorgeous Cornell Borchers (what's  with that name? sounds like a Russian sneezing). There's also something  about a fire and some lost diamonds, or pearls, or gold... I wasn't really  paying attention. If you're looking for Flynn at the end of his tether, try  to find a bootleg of the glorious ""Big Boodle"" or the truly  awesome ""Cuban Rebel Girls,"" both filmed in pre-Castro Cuba and  both highly enjoyable provided you have enough rum handy.",958780800,6,661,4.954545454545454
