8122471,1,B000FGZ2WK,The plot is predictable from beginning to the end. The characters are sketchy. It is not really scary to be a thriller and not that sexy to count as erotic/porn. The only use is if you need to kill 80 minutes of your time.,1168905600,,222,4.068181818181818
8122472,3,B000FGZ2WK,"Okay, right up front, there is indeed fake snuffing going on here - a throat slash (without near enough blood) and a chick gets her hair mussed by a pistol bullet with lots of blood.  There's also several whipping scenes, lot's of nudity and a big blonde girl playing the lead instead of a guy, which means even more nude scenes, including the finale where she gets tied up and prepared to shuffle off the mortal coil, but the calvary shows up of course.  What, I spoiled it for you?  Like she was going to get carved up?

The plot is pretty easy to guess, her sister (or something) disappears into the world of porn and big blonde sis dives into the cesspool to find her (I think, I didn't have the volume up).  Whereupon she's exposed to all sorts of totally stereotypical sleazeballs and lots of bdsm scenes, all of which she screws up her face in disgust at, even though it's mostly for play of course, nightclub type stuff, only gee, maybe some of it is real!  The rest you can figure out.

Considering the NTRL factor (nudity to total running length) and the number of sleaze scenes, this should rate pretty high, but you have to pull back the applause a bit when the scenes are considered in connection with the rest of the flick.  What I mean is, a fake whipping scene that pretends to be real has a lot more impact than a fake whipping scene that is actually depicted as play acting, even if the special effects are superior, and the whipping here looks as real as it gets outside those hard Eastern Europe loops going around now.  So, four stars in sleaze scene terms, but one pulled back for context.",1148774400,7,1611,4.397306397306397
