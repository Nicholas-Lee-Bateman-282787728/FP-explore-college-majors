901993,5,6304546300,As a teenager I read the whole series.  Watched the movies not sure how many times and decided to have it in my DVD collection.,1466121600,,127,4.08
901994,5,6304546300,"I  saw  this  movie  at  Wal mart  for  sale  on  VHS,  I  guess  that  must  have  been  about  10  yrs  ago.  I  knew  I  had  to  get  it.  So  here  I  am  now  watching  it  whenever  I  feel  like  it.
I  enjoy  every  moment  of  this  movie.  Hopefully  I  won't  wear  it  out  on  VHS  anytime  soon  &  end  up  having  to  buy  the  DVD  from  Amazon.  I  probably  will  sooner  or  later  though.  (Hoyt  Axton)  narrates  at  the  beginning.  After  the  big  match  race  from  the  original  all  seems  well  that  ends  well.  &  still  having  no  idea  who  the  horse  actually  belongs  to  or  where  it  really  came  from,  he  keeps  the  horse.  Alec  &  his  mother  decide  to  have  their  own  piece  of  land  for  them  &  the  horse  outside  of  the  city.  &  build  a  barn.  After  everything  that  happens  in  this  movie  you  got  to  wonder  whether  or  not  they  were  wasting  their  time.  All  Henry Daily  (Mickey Rooney)  said  to  Alec Ramsey  (Kelly Reno)  is  that  the  horse  is  a  desert  horse.  &  is  originally  from  a  place  called  Casablanca.  Where  the  real  owners  are.  When  word  got  around  about  Alec  winning  the  race,  I  guess  they  must  have  gone  from  country  to  country  looking  for  the  black,  Alec's  own  personal  name  for  the  horse.  &  without  proof  they  tell  the  clerk  at  the  airport  the  horse  was  stolen  from  them  &  that  they  haven't  come  to  buy  him.  They  did  have  a  picture  of  the  horse,  &  that's  about  it.
They  neglected  to  explain  stuff,  as  well  as  to  Alec's  mother  (Teri Gar).
They  had  to  get  him  before  the  Urruk  leader  Kurr  did  who  sets  the  barn  on  fire  after  the  horse  attacks  him.  Giving  a  perfect  diversion.  Nobody  except  Alec  sees  the  horse  being  kidnapped,  &  he  wastes  no  time.
Despite  the  odds  stacked  against  him  Alec  begins  his  journey.  The  only  thing  he  told  his  mother  was  that  he  knew  where  the  black  was  going  &  he  was  going  after  him.  Its  often  hard  to  reach  an  understanding  with  your  family  when  your  facing  a  problem  like  this,  but  you  know  in  your  heart  what  you  got  to  do.  &  that's  all  that  really  counts.  So  lets  just  say  Alec  would  be  content  to  face  his  mother  later  on,  after  he  got  back  home.
&  had  to  find  a  way  to  handle  &  talk  to  the  original  owners  in  the  most  peaceful  manner.  He  meets  Raj  (Vincent Spano)  who's  intelligent  &  understanding.
All  Alec  seems  to  really  care  about  is  resolving  his  problem.  Not  Raj's  opinions  on  him  forgetting  the  horse.  No  sense  in  trying  to  get  Alec's  mind  off  of  the  horse  whose  main  name  is  Sheaton.  Some  kind  of  an  Arabian  name.
In  their  country  they  treat  guests  &  visitors  the  right  way.  Their  way  is  (They  do  not  refuse  guests  or  visitors)  Alec  assumes  the  protection  from  Raj  &  Mezlar.  He  doesn't  mind  facing  off  against  the  consequences  the  desert  offers  if  things  do  get  tough  for  them.  &  he  learns  something  about  how  the  Arabian  people  are  as  he  travels  with  a  tribe  on  their  way  to  the  oasis,  first  off  Raj,  just  after  they  first  met,  tells  Alec  not  to  wet  his  head  with  the  water,  just  your  head  cloth. Cause  water  is  scarce.  I  think  its  a  different  thing  over  there  compared  to  what  we're  use  to.  Even  though  Raj  &  Alec  argued  a  little  bit  they  still  became  very  good  friends.  Sometimes  when  you  got  a  strong  bond  with  an  animal,  a  sacrifice  is  going  to  be  made,  trying  to  get  things  back  to  normal  &  get  to  the  reasonable  side  with  whoever  doesn't  come  without  obstacles.  I've  never  read  the  book.  I'm  not  much  on  reading  anyways.  I  liked  Alec's  approach  when  he  got  to  Abu Ben Ishak's  village.  Knew  how  to  handle  himself,  &  Abu Ben Ishak,  learned  one  thing.  How  to  be  reasonable.  In  the  beginning  he  only  wanted  the  horse  for  his  own  reasons,  to  win  the  race,  &  Sheaton  must  have  been  some  sort  of  Value  to  Ben Ishak.
During  his  granddaughters  practice  lessons  being  as  it  is  she  said  that  she  was  the  Blacks  rider,  she  is  bucked off.  &  Abu  Ben Ishak  had  told  Alec  not  to  interfere.  &  my  guess  is  that  Alec  took  off  after  the  Black  to  catch  him  &  bring  him  back  after  the  girl  got  thrown  off.  I  didn't  see  that  part.  But  its  my  hint  that  that's  what  happened.  That's  why  he  had  decided  that  it  was  time  for  Alex  to  leave  &  return  to  his  own  country.
&  Kurr,  the  Urruk  leader  who  wants  to  stop  Sheaton  from  winning  the  race  is  dealt  with,  after  Alec  learned  Raj's  friend  &  protector  Mezlar  was  alive  &  being  held  as  a  prisoner  in  the  Urruk  village  that  Alec  escapes  from,  &  frees  Mezlar.  This  is  one  exciting  movie  I've  enjoyed  ever  since  it  was  made.
Its  got  the  action,  &  the  adventure.  &  Alec  survives  no  matter  how  dangerous  things  are  around  him.  In  the  end  everything  turns  out  fine  between  him  &  Ben Ishak.  Who  can  say  more  about  the  movie.  I  loved  every  part  of  it.  Alec  taking  a  stand.  Becoming  an  adult  or  acting  like  one  at  an  early  age.  True  friendship  between  you  &  a  horse  or  a  dog  is  worth  it  if  you  got  a  certain  type  of  problem.  No  matter  how  urgent  it  is.  I'll  say  Alec  did  what  he  had  to  do.
{Spoiler Alert},
At  the  end  Alec  says  I  think  he  belongs  here.  But  promises  to  come  back  &  visit.  He  discovers  the  blacks  happiness  when  he  sees  him  with  their  herd  of  horses.  I  was  very  surprised  that  after  Alec  winning  the  race  he  doesn't  decide  to  take  the  horse  back  to  America.  Just  loosens  the  halter  &  sets  him  free  to  be  with  the  other  horses.  I'm  sure  Raj  or  somebody  would  have  helped  him  take  the  horse  back  across  the  desert.  Arranging  how  to  get  the  horse  back  to  America  whether  it  would  be  by  boat  or  plane,  I  guess  Alec  &  his  Mother  would  probably  be  on  their  own  with  that.  Either  that  or  Alec  may  want  to  convince  his  mother  to  move  out  to  that  country  so  they  both  could  see  the  black  more  regularly.  Choosing  to  say  goodbye  must  have  been  difficult.
He  just  decided  he  wanted  what  was  best  for  him.
Its  normal  for  us  the  viewers  to  be  just  a  little  bit  puzzled.",1464566400,,6732,4.16120218579235
901995,5,6304546300,"Francis Ford Coppola, who has a grand respect for Algerians and Algeria (where most of this movie was filmed) had intended even before The Black Stallion was completed, to revise the location of Walter Farley's sequel from the Arabian gulf coast to Algeria's Mediterranean coast and Algeria's sahara (desert in Arabic) and to use the ancient culture of the amazigh/Touareg people as the protector of their heritage of millennia of horsemanship.  However, due to prior commitments, Coppola had to cede the directing to Robert Dalva while maintaining editorial control as Executive producer.

Casablanca had to be used as an intermediate location due to maintain the historical accuracy of the era of Farley's narrative, and as entrance into the vast sahara -stretching from western sahara (still under Spanish control) across North Africa of which Algeria has more than the lion's share. The fortress scenes where The Black was held captive is in Djanet, Algeria, and the desert scenes with the huge dark boulders is south of Tamanrasset, as were some of the interior rooms where Alec and the young Touareg daughter  of Ben Ishak plotted to 'save' the Black from he father. The oasis and date palmeries were classic Algeria with the luscious baskets of deglet nour dattes (dates in English). Alec's clothing were Touareg -from his flowing turban to the blue of his gandoura.

Coppola's genius is the attention to detail he gives to any of his productions and directorial works.  Case in point in the scene where Alec invites Ben Ishak's daughter into his room, and she demurs by remaining in the hallway in keeping with the tradition of the Berbers then as now.  The use of very typical Berber-Arabic discussions and ultra politeness was and is the epitome of the difference between the too casualness of the West and the polite structure and nuance of North Africa.  Even  the set dressings with the wall hangings ands the divans and low beds were perfectly used to showcase the Berber culture. and using just a soupon of the languages of Southern Algeria gave the western audience a taste of the real north Africans as opposed to the western media's focus of violence and mayhem.  Pay attention to the scene of Alce and his friend being found by Raj's father and companions---when Raj spies his father he shouts 'Abouyia! Abouyia!' Father! Father! When Alec wins the race and Ben Ishak assesses the horse of the loosing riders he comes upon Raj... and in typical Berber-Arabian fashion says: Your fiend's horse is spared!

The then Algerian Minister of Culture and Tourism and his staff worked hand in hand with Coppola's staff to showcase Algeria's beautiful desert and land as well as her people.

A few criticism are that the names of the non-western characters were not authentic and a few of the props were not appropriate-like the hand of Fatima is never used to invoke a malediction as it was in this movie.

The Black Stallion Returns does justice to the Saharans and their culture as it retains the theme of Walter Farley's book f the same name.  the scenery is beautifully filmed, the script is superb, the camerawork exquisite, and the direction marvelous in perfect cadence to the hoof beats of the horses racing thru the sands of the Sahara.",1463443200,,3255,4.907103825136612

It does differ a bit from the book, as most movies do, but it was similar enough to satisfy us and it was fun to have some faces to put with the names we'd come to know from reading the book.  The book had peaked my daughter's interest in Saudi Arabia and so the scenery was quite interesting to her as well.  I was wondering where it had been filmed and at the end it said it had been filmed in the Middle East (I forget the country!) so there was some authentic terrain.

902616,3,6304546300,"Certainly this is a far cry from the magnificent, magical dream-poem that is the original Black Stallion movie. More of a standard animal/adventure film for younger viewers and if you think about it that way, it's not too bad. Most of the original cast (except Mr. Rooney) return and it was made in a timely enough way that Kelly Reno is still relatively young and charming -- a really non-actorish child actor and part of the whole appeal. I read both books as a little tyke, but didn't remember the second book too well. It seems to me that many of the details were changed but the general idea of the Black being kidnapped back to his original home in an Arabic country is retained.
Alec's adventures chasing his horse are appealing and interesting, and so is the climactic race at the end. But the story just peters out, and we never see Alec return home or what he does without his beloved horse now. (You do have to wonder in a kid's film why there is no resolution with his poor mom (Terri Garr), who had to be frantic when her young son mysteriously disappears for about three months.)
I applied the ""11 year old girl who is horse crazy"" test to this film, and decided it would definitely pass. That is who it is really made for, despite the male protagonist (and there is a girl rider in the plot, although she gets the heave-ho in favor of the hero). And that girl (me, about a million years ago) would have enjoyed this, although not as much as the original. It would have held my attention and I would have wanted to view it several times.
If your children loved the first film, this much more prosaic sequel would probably be of interest. Just don't expect great art.",1065225600,17,1680,4.422580645161291
902617,2,6304546300,"As with the first Black Stallion movie, I probably would have liked this one better if I hadn't read the book first. There are lots of things that are changed -- for example, the setting for the Black's home is changed to North Africa instead of Saudi Arabia, and Alec ends up going off on the journey by himself, instead of with Henry and Mr. Volence, the owner of one of the horses who ran against Alec in the match race. But these are changes I can handle. The one thing that really irks me is the way Abu Ishak was portrayed. In the book, Abu Ishak was a pretty nice guy. He offered Alec a reward when he came to claim the Black -- legally and tactfully -- and understood how much Alec loved the Black. When Alec and his travelling companions find Abu Ishak's home, Abu Ishak warmly welcomes them. In the film, however the same character is a total jerk. He ruthlessly snatches the Black away after setting the Ramsay's barn on fire to create a diversion, and even ties Alec up at the pier to stop him from following them. And when Alec treks all the way across the desert to find him, Abu Ishak only allows Alec to stay after Alec coerces him into it by appealing to his conscience. Only at the end at the film does he show something resembling kindness. The ending in the film was OK, but I like the book's ending better, when Ishak promises Alec the Black's first colt. I suppose the directors wanted to make sure there wouldn't be another sequel. Cass-Ole's presence was about the only thing that made this film very appealing.

Alec does some incredibly.. well.. hard to understand things -- like running after the people who are very obviously stealing his horse and getting their attention by yelling ""stop"".  Right, like they're gonna do that.
The book, too, differs greatly in the telling of this story, but personally, I think that this one's better.  In the book version you get the whole planned trip to try to buy a horse off of ben Ishak, but here it's just something that Alec has to do to get his horse back, he does anything he can, motivated by his love.  No doubt the book conveys his emotions too, but I think the movie improved upon the theme.
I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times, and it still gives me chills to this day, more and more as I get older.  The plot isn't that mystifying, and except for a few minor surprise twists don't really make for a suspenseful watch, but if you just watch it for the other aspects, you won't be disappointed.  The race scene is unquestionably one of the high points.  Others are the one where Alec almost reunites with his horse, the one where he actually does, etc.  The music too... More than just touching.

902621,5,6304546300,"I watched this movie in the theater when it first came out. It was a great movie. I cried when Abu ben Ishak claimed the stallion from Alec, while  Alec was trying to encourage the stallion to gallop away, who refused to  move. The book is much different from the movie but both book and movie are  great to read and to watch. I would have liked to see Abu go to Alec's home  and explain about Shetan(the Black's true Arabian name) being his and that  the stallion was stolen from him. (somewhat similar to what the book did.)  Instead they had them kidnap the stallion, wrong thing to do, if Alec was  smart he would have turned back to the cops that must have been at the  house while the barn was burning down and told them that someone was  stealing his horse. But he didn't. What he did was run after the thieves  and get into the trailer with the Black. But they must have stopped once or  twice on the way to the waterfront werehouse. Alex could have easily have  escaped with the Black before they reached the werehouse. The whole movie  was great, a few things were not by the book but I guess that's how  Hollywood wanted the movie to be. I still love both movie and book.",941241600,13,1182,4.242152466367713

7874770,5,6304546300,"As a very young girl, (approx 3 yrs old or younger) I watched this movie and the Black Stallion.
I have always loved horses, but watching this struck me so deeply.  The relationship between human and horse was so beautiful.
I knew at that young age that I wanted to ride, train, work with horses.
Now as an equine professional I am still struck by the relationship these movies portray.  Every rider dreams of having a relationship like thag with a horse. Most never get it.  I was lucky enough to have have had it with a Thoroughbred.  I was a pre-teen when I met him.  And he chose me as his human. It really was like a story. So to honor Rev I am now writing a novel about our years together.  It's a true story, and I am honored to have had this experience to share.
So thank you Walter Farley for your stories of The Black.  And thank you to those who made these movies. For touching my life as a young child. The beauty of each horse is to be cherished. I will be forever grateful to a Thoroughbred whose registered name was Potlatch, but we called him The Reverend.",1517875200,,1072,4.2254901960784315
