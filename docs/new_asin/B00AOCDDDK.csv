5463042,5,B00AOCDDDK,WHEN I SAW THIS ON UP TV STATION I DECIDED IT WAS WORTHY TO PURCHASE FOR MY LIBRARY COLLECTION OF MOVIES AND SERIES.NOW I CAN WATCH IT WHENEVER I WISH.,1375142400,,151,4.066666666666666
5463043,1,B00AOCDDDK,"Maybe it is because I am a westerner, but this movie on top of lousy acting is so far-fetched as to almost be comedic. Obviously the writer has never had anything to do with horses and certainly not wild stallions. I have been photographing wild horses for years and this bit of fluff is nonsense.",1373328000,5,297,4.418181818181818
5463044,5,B00AOCDDDK,"This is so great I have watched it over and over again.
My dad even watched it while flying on a trip, and enjoyed it very much.",1370563200,4,128,3.7777777777777777
5463045,4,B00AOCDDDK,"It's not the next blockbuster, but the movie is well done and easy to watch.  If you're looking for clean family fun, this is a fine choice to watch together with kids and parents of all ages.  Kristofferson does a good job anchoring the cast, and some of the other actors show a lot of promise, even in their archetypal roles.  The film has a ""movie of the week"" vibe that's a bit kitsch, but also appeals to a broad cross section of people, so that's ok.  Gorgeous shots of Western Canada throughout, and some nice camera work add to the  appeal.",1370217600,5,548,4.333333333333333
5463046,3,B00AOCDDDK,I now have this movie in my collection but found it tacky just as well it had horses in it but gives kids the wrong idea about wild horses and bad horse whispering,1365465600,,163,3.9696969696969697
5463047,2,B00AOCDDDK,"I have loved horses since I knew what the word 'horse' meant.  I am 63 yrs old and have not been without a horse since I got my first pony for my 11th birthday.  I've loved them, ridden them for pleasure and exhibited them in horse shows.  WHY, oh WHY can't directors, producers and screen writers make a movie about horses that is realistic??????  For those who would comment that this is a movie about a family sticking together in difficult times, I say it IS.  But it could have been made just as effectively with total realism about horses.  Yet they have a man and his daughter capturing what is supposedly a wild stallion (a STALLION, yet!!) and completely training him to compete in a race that will occur in 2 weeks...2 WEEKS!!!  That's completely implausible!!!  The movie could have had the same uplifting theme using a time frame of at least a year and not a meager 2 weeks to train this WILD stallion for a race.

Another total escape from reality is a rich, snobby banker trying to buy the stallion because the horse is so fast he could, perhaps, be raced in the Preakness or the Kentucky Derby!!!  PLEASE!!!  The only breed of horse allowed to run in any of these races is a Thoroughbred registered by the Jockey Club.  You know... a horse like Man O' War, Seabiscuit, Secretariat, War Admiral, etc.......

And the ending almost had me wanting to pass out.  Selfish, greedy, wealthy people who try to use and abuse everyone do NOT suddenly become all 'warm and fuzzy' as these people did.

The scenery WAS beautiful as were the horses, but the poor acting and completely unrealistic horse aspect negated all of the positives.  I bought the damn thing and wish I had my money back.  Even more, I wish I could have my Saturday night back:  I wasted 91 minutes of my life with this......",1363478400,12,1799,4.5
5463048,3,B00AOCDDDK,"OK..completely predictable but so what.  I knew exactly what was going to happen through the entire movie within the first 18 minutes from beginning to end.  A family in financial trouble decide to try to save the farm by planting a new type of crop, one that makes more money on the market than their current one. They are wonderful parents who are utterly in love and supportive of each other. Their daughter is a good girl who helps out and will do whatever she can to pitch in. She also has the best manners ever.

OK...so you are wondering where the beautiful Midnight black stallion on the cover comes in right?! Well, one day the father is riding to clear his head about the financial problems and his wife's idea about the new crop when he spots a stunning horse just prancing around in the wild.  He decides to try to catch the horse so he can enter a horse race and hopefully win a huge sum of money that would help his family.

So, my thoughts, Kris Kristofferson who I am a huge fan of and if you have ever seen A Star is Born you would know why. He was beautiful looks like he should be playing the grandpa and not the father of this young girl however, I do love him so we will let the fact that I had a hard time understanding him. However, I am a fan of Miss Ferland who was in Eclipse, Cabin In The Woods, The Haunting Hour, Silent Hill and Kingdom Hospital and thought she was perfect as the good, cowboy hat wearing, horse riding daughter.

It is a sweet movie. Even the teen relationship is sweet!  Great family movie full of inspiration and a reminder on how we should never give up!",1361491200,7,1604,4.256578947368421

5463058,1,B00AOCDDDK,"this is the worst horse movie of all time. in the beginning, when the horse starts bucking, he has horse shoes on! a wild horse for pete's sake! and the when the dad is breaking the horse, the reins keep switching in the closeups, and when they are going after the horse, they do a closeup of the riders, it looks like a mop is portrayed as the horse's mane. this part continues throughout the movie. plus, at the end, with the race, when the stallion and the rider goes over the jump, the saddle turns english! that is really stupid! it's not like you can't jump in a western saddle!!!
last but not least, when they almost catch the horse at the beginning of the movie, the horse runs over a rope to trigger the gate to close, the camera does a closeup of the horse's feet and it is clearly two blocks of wood with stilts going over the rope.
Overall, the movie is terrible.
don't waste your money on something that it is totally NOT worth.",1455235200,2,941,4.262569832402234

Life is at the brink and I had to my cell phone shut off because we can't make our 11,000 mortgage payment on land worth 300,000.  We have this pretty black stallion TOTALLY WILD that my grandpa...I mean...my dad catches with a high tech, high security prison gate, but the horse breaks out of it.  Unbelievable!

5463071,1,B00AOCDDDK,"This movie is completely unrealistic in regards to the horse part. First off the horse looks really well groomed to be wild. If they wanted to portray a wild horse then at least let him look the part. Secondly when they somehow capture the horse he is all of a sudden tame and eating grain like he does it every day. A wild horse would have no clue what grain is and it would take them some time to get used to it. The next ridiculously unrealistic scene was how he was magically haltered and saddled out of the blue. Then the girl just hops right up! So stupidly dangerous and not at all the proper way to portray what it is to train a horse let alone a wild stallion! When the horse starts bucking you can see he has all 4 shoes on! Really people?!? Horseshoes on a ""Wild Horse""?! I could go on and on but you get my drift. Typical Hollywood fluff that's so fake. Not worth your time or money.",1414713600,3,895,4.12

5463078,2,B00AOCDDDK,This film was miscast and a very weak supporting cast. I would pass this one up. I did not even finish it.  Kris Kristofferson usually turns in a good performance but this one misfired. He should have been cast as the grandfather not the father.,1407369600,,245,4.444444444444445

5463085,3,B00AOCDDDK,This is a ok typical horse movie where a horse (supposedly wild) comes out of the wild to help save a family. It has a good ending but not a movie that keeps you interested in it.,1395619200,,179,3.864864864864865

5463091,1,B00AOCDDDK,"Kris K should have known better.  WHY didn't they hire at least one person that knew something about a horse?  Stupid, sappy, illogical, ALL of the horse stuff was wrong and trashy except for the McCall saddle.",1375488000,4,210,4.648648648648648
8555287,1,B00AOCDDDK,amazingly disappointing - acting/video all amateurish.,1530316800,,54,8.166666666666666
8555288,2,B00AOCDDDK,"Don't get me wrong, I love horses and horse movies, tv shows, books, etc.  The Black Stallion is a favorite book and movie. If you want fabulous pictures, check out Robert Vavra.
Watched this last night on tv and found it very predictable - farm family in dire financial straights, last ditch effort crop is washed out (after selling livestock and signing last dich loan), yadda, yadda, yadda.  Wild black stallion appears (um, the Black?), girl befriends, dad breaks to saddle...you know the rest. Racing scenes were slo-mo and boring as all get out. Especially bad were the close-ups during the race. Want good racing, watch Man From Snowy River or the Black Stallion.
If you still insist on watching this, do it for free.  I sure would not waste money on it.",1529798400,,761,4.706766917293233
