8040118,3,B00068B5PU,"I love Dolly Parton, but this DVD should be given away free as an advertisement for her albums. She gives about a 20 second review of each song on an album. Her cute voice and bubbly personality was fun at first to watch, but after several minutes it became like watching  commercials.",1426464000,2,285,4.480769230769231

8040120,5,B00068B5PU,"""Dolly Parton: Behind The Scenes"" was originally available only at a well-known department store so the fact Amazon has a few copies left for sale is really remarkable. Featuring an in-debth interview with the Queen of Country Music, this DVD came out way back in 2003 and Dolly discusses her two big projects she had out that year: the beautiful all-female tribute album ""Just Because I'm A Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton"" and Dolly's in-studio patriotic/gospel record ""For God and Country. Dolly talks about the singers who took her songs and gave them new meaning like Allison Krauss (""9 to 5""), Shania Twain (""Coat of Many Colors"") and Melissa Etheridge (""I Will Always Love You"").

 Dolly then discusses her ""For God and Country"" record and how much doing the album, especially after 9 11, meant to her. Dolly is also seen recording her beautiful ""Color Me America"" song.",1334793600,5,874,4.898648648648648
