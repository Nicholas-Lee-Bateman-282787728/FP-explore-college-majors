8561106,1,B00B1TVLZW,"To the author / presenter / celebrity human lie detector / everything else.

If i can give this a -5 (minus five) stars i would. Absolute disaster. Firstly, the dvd that i received was faulty.  The data surface of the disc was damaged. This was obviously done during manufacturing and pressing/replication of the dvd. Hence, the disc will not play. It simply freezes. Dvd cover is beyond cheap and amateurish which brings me to my next point.

The production of this program would be done better by 7 year olds. To the people that made this program (if there were any people) i would say "" Google video production and you might learn something. To Wendy, apparently famous human lie detector - Please use proper microphones and not the ones on your camera or the dodgy one in the hand. Audio is atrocious. For a lady that claims to be on tv and famous magazines you waste first few minutes of this dvd by advertising yourself for the very same dvd. this is embarrassing. Daaaa.....We already bought the dvd. Remember.

You filmed this entire program in your room and backyard. Please stop with those dissolve transitions anymore.
Where is the dvd menu Wendy? Your professional video people should know this. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You did this all by your self.
Do i even try to describe the content and presentation? Embarrassing. It looks you just read all of it 5 minutes before you started filming. And then you ""revealed"" the secrets to us. I feel sooooooo.........LIED TO. OR IS DECEIVED A BETTER WORD. Do i detect sarcasm in my voice? Hmmmm

Stay away from this DVD. I wouldn't allow this on youtube either. That's how bad it is.",1371600000,4,1638,4.63448275862069
