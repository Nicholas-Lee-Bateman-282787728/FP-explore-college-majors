I have been giving copies to people who are unaware of the film. It is/was local - to Louisville, KY - &...it's Derby season! Thank you!",1492560000,,295,3.933333333333333
8194699,3,B000Q66QBU,"I bought this DVD to see Adale O'Brien (Betty) in the film. She played the secretary to Professor Driskoll (Frank Langella) and appeared in a few scenes. I found the cinematography to be first rate especially in highlighting the beauty of Louisville especially famous Churchill Downs (famous for the Kentucky Derby). There are plenty of scenes at Churchill Downs and I have never seen green grass to so lovely onscreen in my life. The horses were a plus too.

Sadly, the writing is weak to me. The storyline about three literature graduate students at the University of Louisville and their love lives never really measure up to me. This is an independent film after all. Frank Langella does his best in playing the literature professor who shares an interest in the horses. Many members of the cast were associated with the Actors Theatre of Louisville (1981 Regional Tony Award recipient) and perhaps the finest theatrical institution in the country. While researching the Actors Theatre of Louisville's production history, I had to see who Adale O'Brien is in the film.

The film was done entirely on location in Louisville, Kentucky. If I have a wish, there would be more films from there. As with most independent films, you have to appreciate it. This film could be better with stronger writing and perhaps older characters. There is only one special feature with behind the scenes for a few minutes. I would have liked to have seen the behind the scenes and the history of the film along with the cast members.

I have co-workers who are avid horse trainers and enthusiasts. I can't wait to give them this DVD so they can enjoy it.",1487462400,,1638,4.801418439716312
8194700,2,B000Q66QBU,"A really hard movie to watch. One star for Frank Langella, he's phoning it in but still the only actor in this, and one star for me because I was an extra in quite a few scenes. Hollywood!",1417996800,,188,3.973684210526316
8194701,1,B000Q66QBU,Flimsy film. Acting is mostly wooden. Pacing is flaccid. Dialogue seems scraped from a fraternity floor. Fear no spoiler alert from viewers because the script telegraphs the plot line Ina heavy handed honk. Even the incandescent Frank Langella can't pull this one out of the porridge. Spend your money on an edible Twinkie instead of this inert bit of detritus.,1404864000,,361,5.033333333333333
8194702,5,B000Q66QBU,"In one film, Bruce Marshall Romans captures the essence of Louisville, love and Langella. The real life Professor Driscoll was one of my wife's father's best friends. According to those who knew and loved him, Romans' movie is a fitting tribute and Langella was the perfect choice to play him. This movie will be your best Amazon find in at least a month, if not longer!",1385424000,,370,4.621212121212121
8194703,4,B000Q66QBU,"I purchased this movie because my cousin, Adale O'Brien, was listed as one of the characters. Although I wanted to see my cousin in film, I found this to be a most enjoyable story, nicely presented, and the background scenery of the Kentucky horse racing track was a real treat.",1300320000,,278,4.58
8194704,3,B000Q66QBU,"This low-budget but well-directed Bill Romans-penned and -starring comedy does better with its nerdy guy banter and easy-going plot than its visions of at what it's like for writers in academia. Judging from the experience of William (Romans), it involves hanging out with friends, hooking up with women way too hot for you, and being too afraid to take the leap to really try writing.

But the strongest parts of the film don't involve writing. The story sees William pursue a blonde-haired beauty while he shtups a hot library clerk and a sex-only brunette vixen who rings him for booty calls. His two best friends, also in grad school for creative writing--played charismatically by Kevin Butler and David S. Jung--run into their own girl troubles.  The film works most when it stays away from any wise pretensions to literary wisdom, with the sole exception of Frank Langella. His screen presence cannot be denied, even in this oddly quiet-voiced role as William's professor who does a less venomous but equally insulting take on John Houseman's epic legal schoolmaster of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase/dp/B00008UALL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase</a>.
