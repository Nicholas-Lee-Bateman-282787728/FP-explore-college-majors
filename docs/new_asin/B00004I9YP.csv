7920475,4,B00004I9YP,"there are a lot of steps taught in this salsa dance lesson video but maybe because of time constraint and a lot of amalgamation involved, the method of teaching is way too fast for anyone to easily grasp.  the steps are terrific if you are already an advance salsa dancer.
the only saving grace for me in this video is the bonus merengue lessons which are easier to follow and the bonus steps are really worthwhile to include in your repertoire. you will enjoy the merengue steps here plus i like the beautiful legs of the lady teacher.",1305417600,,536,4.469387755102041
7920476,4,B00004I9YP,"I bought this video a few days ago and then read the comments on this product page and I was bit hesitant to open the video. However, it is great and in fact one the best that I own from the Josie Neglia series. The salsa moves are excellent, popular, but for advanced salsa dancers only. I found the moves to be great refreshers since I have been taken salsa lessons for almost 10 years now and dance regularly. These moves serve as refreshers for those who are salsa dancers and possibly instructors. If you are a beginner this video is not for you and in fact there's nothing on the box that says ""beginner salsa"" therefore I am not sure where the notion of this video being for beginners originated. Once again the moves are fantastic, common and will help you to break down the moves more if that's what is needed to perfect them.
The downfall of this video to me is the merengue section. The moves are simple; they are shown very quickly and demonstrated all together at the end. I also found that Josie and her partner are not good merengue dancers at all. They are definitely dancing out of time on the moves and I think considering that the salsa section was so advanced and strong they could have done a better display of moves in this section.
The setting and the space for demonstration in this video is excellent. It seems to be an empty nightclub dance floor, which gives them plenty of space to move and be natural. I emphasize this video is a great refresher of advanced salsa moves for those who are at an advanced level and beyond. I do recommend this purchase for ""salseros"".",1054598400,16,1594,4.425170068027211
7920477,5,B00004I9YP,"This video is best when you learn from Josie Neglia's Dance Hot Salsa Videos 1&2 which break down every pattern count-for-count.
This video is great because it teaches leaders how to put a few steps together in a sequence to create flow.
My boyfriend memorized all the 8 combinations and uses them when we dance in the club.  He liked it because he used to always get stuck when he danced in the clubs.  He didn't know which step to do next so he would do the basic step over and over again until he remembered the next step.  This video changed alll that!  He learned these combinations (5 or 6 patterns put together) and now he looks SMOOTH!
I definitely recommend this video to leaders especially.",1032048000,5,700,4.488188976377953
7920478,5,B00004I9YP,Salsa & Merengue 1-2-3 is a video of Salsa combinations from basic to advanced. This video is better viewed after you have learned the steps in her Hot Salsa series. Please note forms/ patterns/ combinations like this  are used to teach you how to flow from one move to the next without a  break. Please do not use these patterns in a nightclub as many other people  also know these patterns & they will may laugh at you. Please note the  tempo of the Salsa music in her videos. If the music is faster remember to  speed up the moves. I have read comments on the message boards about people  using these forms to different speeds of music. The idea is to use these  forms then change then to suit the music. Mix the forms up. Josie also  includes some basic shines.  Josie uses the same pattern to teach as her  Hot Salsa video. Josie then teaches the basic Merengue techniques.,948153600,29,878,4.39751552795031
