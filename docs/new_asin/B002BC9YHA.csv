3892977,4,B002BC9YHA,"In the city of Kchi, on the bucolic island of Shikoku, Taku Morisaki and Yutaka Matsuno form a love triangle with Rikako Muto, an attractive transfer student from Tokyo. Told through an extended flashback, this Studio Ghibli film (made for TV no less) is a poignant tale of teenage love and alienation. When Rikako transfers to his school, Taku does not know what to make of her, but quickly finds himself by turns bewildered and put off by her. Rikako, with her strange Tokyo accent, finds herself alienated from most of her classmates, save for Taku and Yutaka.

What follows can be best described as your typical teenage experience that makes me quite glad that my teenage years are now over a decade behind me. As for the animation, it's your typical high quality Studio Ghibli fare. What you won't find here are any fantastical elements. But if you enjoyed Only Yesterday, then you will enjoy Ocean Waves. This now makes the eighth Studio Ghibli film I have reviewed on here (and the 12th I have seen), and while they all somehow capture a piece of that enigmatic slice of Japan that is so intoxicating to foreigners like myself, it is clear that the movies do it through either realism or through fantasy and very rarely through both at the same time.

Now on to Pom Poko.",1350950400,5,1278,4.6255506607929515
3892978,5,B002BC9YHA,"I'm a huge fan of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. I've seen everything they've released, even every episode of Future Boy Conan. After seeing the major releases, I was clamoring for more, so I went about tracking down each and every Studio Ghibli show they've ever released. Ocean Waves and Only Yesterday were difficult to find, but worth the effort.

Ocean Waves is an adolescent story about growing up in a small town, and the allure of the big city. It's surprisingly complex for an anime feature, and is a rewarding film to watch. I've watched it several times, and it demonstrates perfectly how Miyazaki can pull you into a film. In the same way Totoro was seen through the eyes of a child, Ocean Waves shows us life through the eyes of several adolescent high schoolers. Even though the stories are very different, the grip with which Miyazaki holds the viewers attention is impressive.

If you enjoy Studio Ghibli's earlier efforts, I see no reason why these more obscure films would disappoint. I'd also suggest stopping by Studio Ghibli's website to see which titles you haven't yet seen. Pom Poko, Whisper of the Heart, and even the zany Yamada's (all of which include English dubs) are all worthwhile.",1334448000,19,1209,4.8076923076923075
3892979,5,B002BC9YHA,"Ocean Waves (I Can Hear the Sea) tells the story of a love triangle that develops between two good friends and the new girl in school who transferred from Tokyo. The new girl, Rikako, is at first appears arrogant and distant, but eventually makes friends. Another Studio Ghibli jewel. Yes, I am a Ghibli fanboi.",1318291200,5,311,4.672727272727273
3892980,5,B002BC9YHA,"""Ocean Waves"" was made by Tomomo Mochizuki of Studio Ghibli and it is one of the loveliest of the non-Miyazaki movies from this studio, although it is a fine example of the Studio Ghibli styles and philosophy.
The story is a deceptively simple one (like that of ""Only Yesterday"" and ""Whisper of the Heart"") and it concerns three people, two boys, Kochi and Taku, and a girl, Rikako. Kochi and Taku go to highschool in a sleepy coastal town on the island of Shikoku, they seem like pretty average boys and then along comes an attractive transfer student from Tokyo, the tempestuous Rikako. Both boys develop an interest in Rikako and difficulties arise when Rikako hoodwinks Taku into a trip to see her divorced parents in Tokyo....

""Ocean Waves"" is very far from the powerfully vivid fantasies of ""Spirited Away"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and the magnificent epic human dramas of ""Nausica: The Valley of the Wind"" and ""Princess Mononoke"". Rather it is a pastel water colour painting by comparison - a film rich in gentle and unspoken emotions. It is a graceful and gentle film - a film to be enjoyed on a peaceful afternoon or a warm Summer night, perhaps. I have watched it three times and I've enjoyed it each time.

The music for this film is very good - all orchestral music with some piano music too.

The use of small screen for several moments in a couple of places betrays the origin of this movie - it was made for television in the early 1990s. Li",1314921600,10,1462,4.593869731800766
3892981,4,B002BC9YHA,"`Ocean Waves' is one of the more obscure films in the Ghibli catalogue and whilst it has less of a fantasy feel to it than their other films, it still has a certain charm. This follows two boys and a girl at school who strike up an unusual friendship. She is very impudent and rude and they can't seem to stop helping her when she is gets into awkward situations. There are also the inevitable tensions when any relationship triangle occurs. This has the attention to detail that I have come to expect from Ghibli films and the animation is as precise and beautiful as ever, indeed it reminds me of a great deal of `The Cat Returns' in animation style. There is the occasional use of small screens within a larger white screen, usually linking various scenes, that I haven't seen in Ghibli films before and whilst it didn't seem to add a great deal to the film, it didn't detract from it either. There is no English dubbing for this film and the subtitles and Japanese language lend this a certain authentic feel I enjoy when watching anime films. The extras are very sparse on the DVD, in fact all you get is a trailer for the film. All in all this is an OK film, it isn't very strong on story and after recent outstanding Ghibli films I found this a little disappointing, but in it's own right it is perfectly enjoyable and a nice way to spend 70 minutes of your time. This is easy going, inoffensive and worth adding to your Ghibli/anime collection at some point.

8360969,5,B002BC9YHA,"Another amazing Myiazaki movie. I admit, I succumbed and got all 19 movies plus a Totoro diorama to mark the spot on the shelf. Ponyo was the gateway drug though.
