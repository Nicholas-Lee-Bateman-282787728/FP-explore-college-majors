8124965,1,B000FOMSVU,If anybody has seen the original movie they will be sorely disappointed with this copy. A lot of the scenes are out of order and they cut out a lot of parts. I had to return this movie because it's not the original no matter what this company says.,1488585600,,248,4.081632653061225
8124966,2,B000FOMSVU,"A cute romantic comedy with gravity defying Akshay Kumar, the always adorable Karisma Kapoor, and the greatly missed sidekick Laxmikant Berde. Too bad Eros couldn't release a better version. Low resolution, the sides have been chopped, clearly some frames are missing (I'm guessing a better print isn't available), and the subtitles are frustratingly delayed. I'm still glad I have it, but it's a disappointing presentation.",1454198400,,424,5.538461538461538
8124967,3,B000FOMSVU,"a very restrained performance from jumping jack jeetu, and chintu excels in his Urdu dialog delivery. The movie is authentic and dialogs classic. The story might seem cheesy for a few (a love triangle) but the movie should be seen not for the story but for the period, acting and language. Rekha supports well with her tawayuff character. Watch the movie if you are a nostalgic film buff of the late seventies and early eighties. This movie seems to be one of the chosen few...nay...the only one to be made on the grand Urdu culture of Lucknow and Muslim Northern India of the past, replete with its full glory and perhaps, debauchery and filthy wealth of its Nawabs.",1302480000,,667,4.661016949152542
