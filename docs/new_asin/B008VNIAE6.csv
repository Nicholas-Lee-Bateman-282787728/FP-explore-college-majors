5185355,2,B008VNIAE6,"I bought this movie thinking it was actual full length movie for my nephews.  My youngest nephew didn't like it because he said ""It didn't make me laugh"" and I agree that the movie is somewhat on the boring side.  Also this is more like an episode than a movie, this DVD is a whopping 25 minutes long, there are special features and such but my nephews are not interested in that stuff.

EDIT: Also I'd like to add that this movie is available on Netflix as of Dec 4, 2012 so you may want to check it out there before purchasing it.",1354579200,15,532,4.145631067961165

5185361,4,B008VNIAE6,"Since this Christmas special (or holiday special, whatever people call it) is very good. I will admit, I'm not a HUGE fan of movies where the character is torn, but like I said, since this involves ""Kung Fu Panda"", I enjoy it well enough. Po struggling to keep up with the Kung Fu winter Feast is funny, and so is the bunny chef trying to restore his honor. I do feel a tiny bit sorry for Shifu when he was embarrassed about Po and the rest of the Kung Fu masters going to Po's party, but seeing everyone happy and helping others, I'm glad he decided that it was perfect. I know if I were Po, I couldn't handle the kung fu party. I also liked the DVD feature that shows how to use chopsticks. It will probably come in handy later on.",1352678400,3,733,4.1328671328671325

5185364,5,B008VNIAE6,"Of all DreamWorks franchises, Kung Fu Panda is my favorite.  (Theyve got a couple of great stand alones as well that could become favorite franchises, but thats another post.)  Still, I somehow missed Kung Fu Panda Holiday when it aired on TV.  Fortunately, I was able to catch up with it on DVD.

The Winter Festival is coming, and Po (voiced by Jack Black) is looking forward to the annual feast.  He and his father always serve a festive meal in the family restaurant for their friends who have no one else to celebrate the day with.  Its become a tradition that everyone looks forward to.

However, this year, as the newly discovered Dragon Warrior, it is Pos responsibility to create a feast for all the Kung Fu masters in China.  Suddenly, every gesture he makes has incredible meaning.  Will he be able to pull of the feast or will the pressure be too much for him?  And what about his own family tradition?

Anyone who has seen a Christmas special or two knows where this is going.  However, the journey to get there is still fun and the final few scenes are very rewarding.  Po is always a lovable main character, and his antics keep you engaged throughout the entire show.  I do feel this is a bit more aimed at kids rather than their parents.  They will enjoy it the most, although theres nothing here that will irritate or annoy parents.

While Christmas is never mentioned in the special, it is obvious this is a Christmas special.  Of course, since the franchise is set in ancient China, it makes sense they would not celebrate the holiday the way we do.  Still, there are enough similarities that it will give you that glorious feeling you get from Christmas specials.

The voice cast from the movie is back for this special, and they do a delightful job of bringing their characters to life again.  The focus is really on Po, so most of the supporting cast doesn't have much to do, but when they are around, they are great.  The animation might be a bit scaled back since it was done for TV, but it is still impressive and enjoyable.

Im sorry I missed Kung Fu Panda Holiday when it was on TV, but Im glad I got a chance to see it now.  Any fan of the franchise will enjoy seeing their friends again every December.

NOTE: I watched this as part of the Dreamworks Holiday Collection, which I received in exchange for my honest review.",1434067200,,2350,4.4496487119437935

5185371,5,B008VNIAE6,"This is one of the better holiday short movies, it carries the Kung Fu Panda theme in less that 1 hour yet still keeps the charm of the
movie",1388620800,,141,3.896551724137931
5185372,3,B008VNIAE6,"Set during the holiday time after Po has become the Dragon Warrior, KUNG FUN PANDA HOLIDAY focusing on a tough choice Po has to make. As the Dragon Warrior, he is informed my Master Shifu that he is responsible for hosting the Winter Feast for all the Kung Fu Masters. However, he torn because the Winter Feast has always been a time that he and his father have spent together fixing chicken noodle soup for all the poor in the community. Hosting the Winter Feast is a huge honor, but spending the Winter Feast with his father is also very important. With the help from the Furious Five and a rabbit cook named Wo Hop, Po thinks he will be able to appease both his father and Master Shifu. However, Po realizes that even with all the help, he has to choose between the two.

In terms of the Kung Fu Panda series, KUNG FU HOLIDAY is an excellent special. It fits right in with the world established in the original KUNG FU PANDA movie. The movie also has all the voices from the movie back for this special (Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, David Cross, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, etc.). That doesnt always happen for short specials like this, so its really nice when it does.

With that said, in terms of Christmas specials, KUNG FU HOLIDAY doesnt really fit. The movie is marketed and sold at Christmas and is often packaged with other Christmas specials. However, this is NOT a Christmas movie. The holiday being celebrated is the Winter Feast, a holiday which seems most similar to the Dongzhi Festival that is a celebration of the winter solstice in many eastern countries of the world. This doesnt make the movie a bad movie, but I know of parents who were disappointed after watching this special because it wasn't a Christmas movie. Also, the short is only about 22 minutes, not including the credits.

Overall, KUNG FU PANDA HOLIDAY is a decent winter short set in the world of Kung Fu Panda. Personally, I just found it okay, but I believe those who are fans of the movie will probably really enjoy it.

The DVD includes several extras including a short on how to use chopsticks, a short on how Wo Hop the rabbit was drawn, some games, and lots of Dreamworks shorts.",1388361600,2,2194,4.5188916876574305

5185396,4,B008VNIAE6,"The thing I liked best about this short holiday special is that Dreamworks didn't take shortcuts. Instead of just using whomever to voice the actors, they hired the original cast to come back, including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Jackie Chan, and so forth. Clearly, they could have skipped this step, particularly for some lesser characters that barely make an appearance, but using all the original voices goes a LONG way toward making this a quality production. Also great is that the animation is top notch, embracing the unique, vibrant style that the feature length films pioneered.

Unfortunately, this holiday special is only twenty-something minutes long, which makes it a questionable purchase (you would be far better off buying Kung Fu Panda 1 or 2), but as a holiday special that you catch on TV (or Netflix, for that matter) along with Rudolph and whatnot, it works great! Po is as endearing and lovable as ever, voiced by the brilliant Jack Black, and I enjoyed watching this short story unfold, as it explored the relationship between father and son, and the significance of family during the holidays.",1356393600,,1143,5.015789473684211
