8050668,3,B0007R4TQ2,"This video is interesting, but not quite what I had envisioned based on the title.  I had thought this was going to be a video about a safari in Botswana with Peter Capstick, or at least a safari in which he would provide a running dialogue.  Instead, this video is really a sales pitch for safaris in Botswana with some appearances by PC.  For those of you who don't know who PC is (or was), he was an African safari hunter/guide and probably the best author of safari literature of the `modern' era.  He passed away in 1996.  In this video, we follow one of the producers of the video company that made this film (Westlake Entertainment) as he goes on safari in Botswana.  We actually follow hunts in three different regions of Botswana, none of the hunts are actually guided by Capstick.  Most of the hunting is grazing animals (oryx, etc.), not big game.  PC shows up after the animal is killed to say a few things about the trophy quality, etc.  There are also a few segments in which PC describes how he carries his gun, hunting safety, his choice of clothes, etc.  The narrator continually intersperses phrases like `experience of a lifetime', `you'll want to return again and again', and `friends forever' throughout the video.  I really got the sense that they were trying to sell people on purchasing safari packages.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of great African cinematography in this video and some good hunting scenes and lots of information about safaris and the fauna in general, but it is definitely NOT a video of `Hunting with Capstick' or some such thing.  As such, this is probably worth a rental by anyone who enjoys PC's books or has an interest in African hunting (or even hunting in general), but at $25 this is not likely a video you'll watch over and over again.  You're probably better off spending your money on a few more boxes of ammunition.",1163203200,6,1879,4.570149253731343
