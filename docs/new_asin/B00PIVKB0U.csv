6808802,5,B00PIVKB0U,I never thought the final two films would ever be released. So I was extremely happy to see it pop up as a suggestion when I logged onto Amazon today. Great memories. Just pre-ordered mine. Thanks Paramount!,1417824000,15,207,4.621621621621622

6808815,3,B00PIVKB0U,"These two films are the lesser of the series but far from disappointing. I am sure I must have seen them sometime in the 70's but they left not the same lingering impression as The House Without A Christmas Tree. The character of Addie is truly likeable and it would have been nice to have seen her growing up and confront the world beyond her small town. The films can all be very ""old fashioned"" at times but that is certainly to it's strength as they are little glimpses back to a time that were deceptively simple. As Addie grows she faces more adult emotions and situations which are still just as valid today as they were then. The stories are not so simple and designed to provide ""warm fuzzies"" for the viewer. All the main actors are exceptional....most especially Lisa Lucas. I'm sure I had a deep crush on her in my youth. Addie and the King of Hearts was a bit puzzling at times when Addie developes a crush on the substitute teacher with intent to see it become something more. Her father (played with gruff and sadness by Jason Robards) and her grandmother (played with a quiet strength by Mildred Natwick) seem to think little of a relationship between a 14-year-old girl and a man in his early twenties.....but who hasn't had a crush on a teacher or two in their lifetimes. The Easter Promise is probably the weakest of the series as Addie befriends an actress who has resturned to her hometown to settle some family business. It has moments but it never really comes together as a drama. I have no regrets adding these films to my own collection and may improve on repeat viewings. Addie's strength and courage as she faces all the challenges of growing up is very sweet and very encouraging. She is a wonderfully positive role model for anyone regardless if they are female or male. There are good lessons to be imparted that are presented without the sugary coating and the schmaltz.",1483574400,,1902,4.564327485380117
6808816,5,B00PIVKB0U,I have all four of these family classics now and enjoy all of them.,1482192000,,67,3.857142857142857
6808817,4,B00PIVKB0U,First I had been looking for both these films for a long time.  I had the Easter Promise on VHS but really wanted it on DVD.  Now I have all four of the Addie Mills movies that I remembered watching while growing up in the 70's.  Jean Simmons is great in the Easter promise and I had forgotten Richard Hatch was in Addie and the King of Hearts.  These films will be part of our annual  holiday viewing in my household.,1474502400,,418,4.111111111111111

6808821,5,B00PIVKB0U,"Am so glad I found this DVD.  I am a fan of old movies...they take me back.  I have ""A House Without a Christmas Tree"" and ""The Thanksgiving Treasure.""  They are good family movies for the holidays. Adding these to my collection was just what I needed.  I love to snuggle under a blanket and put these movies on...very endearing.",1465430400,,329,4.433333333333334

6808839,4,B00PIVKB0U,"I am giving this set a mixed review because however much I love the character of Addie Mills, the third and fourth specials are not as good as the first two. Please do not let that stop you from buying them, because anything about Addie is better than no Addie at all!

In THE EASTER PROMISE, twelve year old Addie Mills is thrilled to learn that Constance Payne, a famous stage actress, is returning to Clear River to sell her late mother's house and is eager to meet her because of the glamour associated with her being on stage. She and her friends take the woman flowers to welcome her home. But Constance Payne has problems that the girls don't understand and Addie will have the friendship tested by the end of the story. I do love the sleepover scene with Addie and her friends (and the subsequent scenes when they are decorating the Easter eggs and teasing Terry, and the humorous parts of the Style Show), and also the scene on the worksite where Addie brings her dad the cake and lemonade and they talk about Constance's father.

One of the bigger disappointments is the setting itself. In the first two specials CBS also allowed the story to be filmed ""on location,"" if not in Nebraska, at least on the prairies, the Canadian prairies, and in a little town in Ontario, Uxbridge, that looked a lot like Nebraska must have looked back then. You didn't have the LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE effect with ""Minnesota"" looking like the southern California hills and it lent much to the verisimilitude of the story. The exteriors for THE EASTER PROMISE are filmed on a stage set and it shows very, very badly on videotape, especially a scene where Addie arrives when James and Grandma are working in the vegetable garden and also in the scenes where Constance's house is visited. The situation which has been so carefully crafted previously is jolted by the glaring sets and for me, at least, the illusion was ruined. One scene has Addie visiting James on the job and he is using his crane near a wooden bridge that has been used in so many television shows that it sticks out like that proverbial sore thumb in the background.

They couldn't even be bothered to try to duplicate the ""Clear River"" scenes of the first two stories and it diverges wildly from Addie's original opening narration to HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE where she declares that Clear River is so small there are no buildings over three stories tall and the town has no traffic light because none is needed. The closing scene clearly shows a downtown that is a lot larger (and taller) than Addie described.

Every time I watch ADDIE AND THE KING OF HEARTS I am disappointed that the series of stories ended on such a low note. Everything in the story is by-the-numbers: Addie's jealousy, her crush, James' involvement with a woman totally unlike his first wife, the handsome teacher who encourages Addie but turns out to be engaged to be married. No one seems to have his/her heart in the performance, especially Jason Robards, who was so magnificent as the grieving man of the first story. This touches on a lot of emotional issues with Addie reacting to her dad paying attention to another woman after thirteen years and her very real and eventually hurtful crush on her substitute teacher, but none of the emotions seem real. Diane Ladd's performance is the most lively, but slightly overdone. I wish they had used the story the way the book arranged it--except for including Irene's story of her past from the television version, which was superior to the book version, and also the corsage scene from the television version--and recast the roles of Cora Sue and Billy Wild (especially since Addie seemed at a loss without a best friend to bounce her emotions off). And the sets look cheap; if you notice, the door to the living room is always half-closed because they never rebuilt the actual room, and even the school cloakroom lacks the richness of the one in the first story. Not the best send-off for an otherwise excellent set of films.",1427068800,14,4020,4.657746478873239

6808842,5,B00PIVKB0U,"Two cute movies, same family as HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE.  In these two movies on one DVD, Addie is growing up and finding it hard to understand her cantankerous father during the 1940's.  Her grandma continues to be a help to both Addie and her father.  Our family enjoyed both movies on this DVD.  We would recommend it.",1426291200,,328,4.508474576271187

6808845,4,B00PIVKB0U,"I have not seen either of these since they first aired. All the crap they show on TV now and they can't show old stuff like this, which is a step above. I think ""The Easter Promise"" is better. The last one, ""Addie and the King of Hearts"", has Lisa Lucas not acting like the old Addie. It looks like she was feeling very awkward in real life.",1424563200,,341,4.029411764705882
6808846,5,B00PIVKB0U,These movies were my favorite growing up and they are still amazing to watch. The way they are filmed is almost like watch a stage play. Great family viewing.,1424044800,,158,4.482758620689655

6808849,5,B00PIVKB0U,"At one time, the three main television networks use to develop their own films for television.  CBS seemed the most focus on family entertainment, a concept that seems to only exist on a few cable channels today.  The Addie Mills stories was one of them.  It has taken me a long time to get all 4 holiday stories on DVD or VHS.  I was so happy when Amazon announced preorders for this doublef featured Addie Mills set.  It's easy to read the summaries, so I won't retell them here.  I do guarantee that these stories are true to real life stories, that are about us!  The stories are about the normal interactions between family members, our dreams, hopes, challenges, and disappointments.  And yet, the end of each story always brings out the real character in each of us, that shines beyond where we might be lost because of the changes of technology in our lives.

These stories are timeless; and they will deeply penetrate the pure souls of our children, as well as our own hearts on how we interact with our children.  All four stories, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day, and Easter, are great to play and replay on each of these holidays.",1423699200,3,1150,4.620689655172414
6808850,5,B00PIVKB0U,"The DVD contains two movies that are family friendly. The star is a young girl named Addie and she lives with her father and grandmother.

Addie says what is on her mind and she has a strong will. In the movie THE EASTER PROMISE, Addie helps a hometown Broadway star who has lost her job, once again find enjoyment in life and a reason to live.

Easter is the promise of new life. Everyone faces some kind of personal challenges. Being a friend to someone who is facing difficulties is a blessing to that person and the one who is the friend. All of these were themes in this movie.
