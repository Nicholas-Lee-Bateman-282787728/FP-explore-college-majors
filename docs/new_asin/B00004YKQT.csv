1376177,4,B00004YKQT,Don't Drink the Water is hysterical!  I am a huge Woody Allen Fan and have seen nearly all of his movies.  There are some movies by Woody that even I'm not that fond of BUT.....this is not one of them.  This movie is entertaining and well cast.  There is a lot going on and everytime I watch it I find something different that gets me going!  Buy this movie and keep an eye on the subtleties.  You won't be disappointed!,1008374400,20,420,4.1875
1376178,1,B00004YKQT,"OK, so I didn't actually watch the whole thing, and maybe (just maybe) it got better at the end... but I just couldn't take it anymore!  If what Woody was going for was a chaotic mess then he succeeded.  It was filmed partially as a docu-comedy with a narrator and hand held camera (reminiscent of ""Take the Money and Run), but without the character interviews.  This shaky camera technique is difficult to watch, limits the possible shots, and detracts from your ability to ""suspend disbelief.""  Am I supposed to think there's a guy there with a camera filming reality?  If so, why don't the people notice it or talk to it?  It would have been better filmed as the Broadway play it was written to be.
But that's just the start of the problems...
This movie lacked any sense of comedic timing!  It was almost as if there had been no rehearsals at all (more of the docu-comedy technique?).  Woody overpowered everyone in every scene he was in.  Michael J. Fox looked like he didn't know what he was supposed to do or say next, but struggled along like a trooper trying not to do an impersonation of Woody Allen.  Unlike Miyam Bialack, who showed she could stretch from playing ""Blossom"" by playing a female version of Woody.  By the way, she also looked far too young for the role.  Julie Kavner is always good, but there really wasn't anything for her to do but talk on the phone.  And I was just embarrassed for Dom DeLouise who appeared to be adlibbing over the top while everyone around him tried to ignore him.",999993600,2,1514,4.501831501831502
1376179,3,B00004YKQT,"This 1994 TV movie released to video in late 2000 tells an inane tale of a Jewish American family that, while vacationing in Russia, is mistaken for a ring of spies during the height of the cold war in the 1960's.  This is the story of their exploits as they are holed up in the American Embassy waiting for their chance to return to the U.S.
The story was written and directed by Woody Allen, who is one of the most accomplished auteurs in the history of film.  It is clear that Allen purposely dumbed this screenplay down for TV.  Instead of his trademark cerebral humor that cuts like a scalpel, he uses a machine gun approach, hitting the viewer with a fusillade of lowbrow jokes and slapstick gags.  The humor ranges from insipid silliness to standard sitcom fare with occasional intellectual ironies thrown in for his devoted fans.  Though most of it is infantile, the sheer volume of material (literally five to ten jokes and gags a minute) insures that something will tickle you every couple of minutes.
The cast is rich with accomplished comedic talent.  Michael J. Fox plays the son of an ambassador who is a hapless diplomat in training.  His frenetic and tortured style of comedy is perfect for this role.  Dom DeLuise adds his wacky brand of humor as a priest who has been in hiding in the embassy for six years and is trying to learn to be an amateur magician.  For him, the extra inhabitants of the embassy represent a captive audience on whom he can inflict one botched magic trick after another.  Julie Kavner brings her whiny New York accent and her wonderful sense of sarcastic timing to play off Woody Allen's inimitably overwrought caricature of himself.  Kavner is a refreshing change for Allen.  We are used to seeing him across from flaky wimps played by Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.  The use of the bluntly badgering Kavner added significant energy to his performance.  The cast is rounded out by Mayim Bialik (TV's, Blossom) who was decent, but not great as the Jewish American Princess in captivity.
Overall, this was a good comedy that was significantly below Woody Allen's standard.  There are plenty of funny lines, but it is a much too farcical.  I rated it a 6/10.  If you enjoy Woody Allen's normal introspective and intellectual humor, this might be a disappointment.",975801600,2,2301,4.698254364089776
1376180,4,B00004YKQT,"In the TV-movie version of Allen's phenomenally funny play, a host of wonderful cast-members make this a delightful film.  Allen and Kavner are funny, as usual, playing a bickering couple on the run.  A pleasent surprise in this film is Dom DeLuise's comedic performance as the ""in-house"" priest at the embassy.  His ill-timed magic tricks and Eastern European accent made the movie!  Now that it has finally made the trip from the small screen to the video market, I highly recommend this innoxious film.",974851200,2,505,4.976190476190476

1376203,4,B00004YKQT,"I missed the original movie of Woody's film from his stage play. I liked the cast of this one, so I ordered it. I am a Woody fan, so it and the original with Jackie Gleason are must sees. The play from the 60's has a cold war era story. Also, it has the kind of humor and one liners from Woody's pre-Annie Hall era. It has a vaudeville/burlesque sensibility, like an old Bob Hope film. Woody apparently admired Bob Hope films as he suggests in the recent 3 hour PBS documentary about him. The documentary is available on Amazon Instant Video, I believe.",1363737600,2,553,4.326923076923077

But then I started seeing it in a new light.
Apparently it is a filmed version of a Broadway play Allen wrote.
It has to viewed as another of his slapstick comedies, like Take the Money and Run or Bananas
Just a series of gags. Rather consciously conceived I think like a Marx Bros. movie where the premises are all over the top.
All the characters are cartoons and I think the movie gets funnier and funnier as it goes along.",1353024000,,544,4.29126213592233

This TV movie is marginally better, has a good music track but is thoroughly unfunny. Allen and Kavner endlessly annoy as whiny tourists trapped at the US embassy in Moscow. Bialik is plain-looking; not sure why Fox's character is attracted to her. For Woody completists only.

A rare look at the complexities of the former Communist world through the antics in the US Embassy of an invented country of Vulgaria.

Michael J. Fox, Dom DeLuise and the girl playing Woody's daughter stink.  Their combined horrible acting brings down the movie.  Casting Fox in this role is beyond comprehension!  His ""acting"" was pathedtic.  He couldn't stand still for even a few seconds in a scene.  Woody should have burned all copies since this leaves a bad taste for his other great films.

1376215,3,B00004YKQT,"`Don't Drink the Water', directed by Woody Allen and based on a Broadway play by Allen is distinctly different from most of his other films due to its dated and just ordinarily funny plot and jokes.

As amazing as it may be to say this, almost all of Allen's movies hold up extremely well over time. There seem to be no serious dependencies on the events of the day. Even Zellig, which takes place in a definite time in history, stands up as well as, for example, `Casablanca' or `The Godfather' based on the durability of the story. The movie under consideration, however, depends a lot on early cold war situations as they may have played out in an American embassy in Prague, Budapest, or Warsaw in the early sixties. Much of the background depends on the pre-Cuban Missile Crisis Kennedy administration. Even the title pictures Eastern Europe as not much more advanced in public sanitation as a Banana Republic, let alone our favorite target of such jokes, Mexico.

I believe this movie, which may have been made for television, was filmed relatively recently, probably after Michael J. Fox left `Family Ties' and while or before he began his last TV series before retiring due to Parkinson's Disease. I have strong suspicions, however, that the play was written in the early sixties, not too long after the time in which the play takes place.

One result of this being an adaptation from a stage play is that there is little or none of Allen's visual humor. All on screen business is written to be done on a stage with one scene on stage at a time. There are also practically none of Allen's favorite topics and plot tricks. This is nothing more than a stage comedy, and virtually none of Allen's other movies are `nothing more than stage comedies'.

That does not mean this is not funny. Allen is as good a joke writer as he ever was. It's just that the movie doesn't engage our interest. Compared to, for example, two average Allen movies, `Shadows and Fog' and `A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy', the characters simply don't sustain our interest. This may be due in part to weaker acting by Fox, Kavner, DeLuise, and Herrmann, when compared to Mia Farrow, John Malkovich, Jose Ferrer, and Tony Roberts, but I don't think so, as the principle's are pretty well cast into parts for which they are eminently suited. Julie Kavner, for example, plays almost exactly the same role as she does in the excellent `Radio Days'.

Even the plot resolution and the minor love interest are predictable.

So, while I am a great Woody Allen fan, I suggest this is one of the very few of his works you can pass up without feeling any sense of loss. It is enjoyable to watch once, but it has little staying power.",1120953600,9,2701,4.616666666666666
1376216,5,B00004YKQT,"From their entrance into the American Embassy to their exit, the Hollanders are a handful. It's funny just watching Michael J. Fox's character attempting to deal with all the craziness that occurs as soon as they arrive. I don't know where Woody Allen comes up with such interesting storylines for his movies; the set ups are completely unique, and they pave the way for such easy and instant laughter. I rarely choose to check out movies that I haven't seen before because I'm always wanting to watch my favorites again & again, like this one.",1109721600,7,544,4.7368421052631575
1376217,4,B00004YKQT,"Somehat uneven and not as tight in terms of plot as many other Allen films -- basically more of a setup (wacky family seeking asylum in embassy) to let the jokes roll -- but many laugh-out-loud moments and gags.  I often find Dom DeLuise to be just too much, but here he shows a little restraint and gets the priest character just right.  His ""priest"" has a network of intelligence behind him, & he telephones them with ""subtle"" coded messages such as, ""The boy with the blue hair is fondling a chipmunk."" He also performs some of the best magic routines I've ever seen; best because they are so hilariously stupid.  ROFLMAO to see him giving the tricks away either as he's performing them or immediately afterward, when he casually put down the ""secret"" prop or whatever in plain view.

Great laughs, easy to watch -- Allen gives us one of his lowbrow characters rather than his intellectual neurotic types.

1376218,5,B00004YKQT,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have NEVER been a Woody Allen fan.  I had seen some of his earlier movies and just never got into them.  However, I got hold of a copy of ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" with Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Angelica Huston and, of course, Woody.  I have just about worn it out because I've watched it over and over.  I went to the video store and browsed through their Woody Allen titles and saw ""Don't Drink the Water"".  I decided to give it a try since I like Dom Deloise, Julie Kavner and Michael J. Fox.  Let me tell you, there are very few movies I see that make me truly laugh out loud - this one did.  The entire premise of the movie is so funny.  Woody takes his wife and daughter on a vacation to Russia (who goes to Russia for a vacation!?!), does the usual tourist routine, and ends up being chased by KGB agents because they think Woody and family are spies!  Woody was taking pictures of the sunset and he must have photographed something that would make the agents think he was spying.  Anyway, Woody and family take off running and go to the American Embassy in Russia to seek asylum.  And believe me, the place is an asylum.  Michael J. is the son of the Ambassador.  The Ambassador has to return to Washington, D.C. and reluctantly leaves the embassy in Michael J.'s hands (Michael has been pretty much a screw-up all of his life) so his father doesn't trust him.  As soon as Woody and family reach the embassy the fun begins.  There is an Italian priest, played by Dom Deloise, who had to seek asylum at the embassy and has been there for years.  He's really into magic tricks and thinks he's a real pro.  The embassy chef cooks all kinds of exotic foods that drive Woody nuts (Woody is a New Jersey caterer) and Woody and the chef have an ongoing battle.  The daughter falls for Michael J., the mother, Julie Kavner, ends up taking over the housekeeping at the embassy, a visiting Middle Eastern dignitary arrives and...just watch this movie!  There is so much I can't begin to tell it all but trust me if you like just good old fashioned comedy you'll enjoy this.  I highly recommend it - that's why I came to Amazon to find a copy because you can't find it at local video stores to buy.  Every time I watch it I see something that sets me off laughing.  If this movie does not make you laugh you have a serious problem with your funnybone!!",1100390400,32,2393,4.318385650224215
1376219,4,B00004YKQT,"What kind of Woody Allen fan are you?  Do you favor his heavy, drama-laden homages to Bergman?  His film noir?  His zany early comedies?
If you love the latter, you'll probably like this ""lost"" gem.  A bit like ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" which was resurrected years after it was written, ""Don't Drink the Water"" conjures the early days of Allen's career with zany comedy full of larger than life characters and over-the-top performances.
The cast is great, the script is too, the plot moves along nicely and in general I had great fun.  Yes, it seems a bit claustrophobic at times and a bit stagey, but many of Allen's recent work has a similar feel regardless of the genre.
All in all it is an enjoyable farce that harkens back to the golden days of Allen's comic genius.",1089244800,16,772,4.605839416058394

The embarassment of the jewish author, who strangely didn't attend the staging due to pregnancy (and started the well known gossip story of a love affair with the dignatary), made him start a re write, which lead him to just leave the title and change everything else (including his famous B&W credit card to the more festive Filemn Pacheco, which sadly didn't make it to the final cut).
If you wanna see Michael J. Fox not traveling to the future (or the past) this is the movie you want to steal from a relative who already owns it and is not that aware of the things he has bought.
