8047064,1,B0007DBB8A,"I purchase language learning products for a French library and thought that this product may be helpful to our library patrons. As I was preparing it to add to the collection, I read over their key words and phrases guide and found NINE MISTAKES!!! The most glaring mistake was that they translated the number 10 as ""diez"" which is the spanish translation. Words were misspelled and the accents on words were wrong or missing. Even on the DVD I found the same mistake as mentioned above. I would not trust this manufacturer to give me the correct information as they obviously did not hire a native French speaker to proofread their product. It is cheap and has no real value in my opinion.",1392940800,,690,4.617886178861789
8047065,1,B0007DBB8A,"The DVD case arrived broken.  ok, bad start but I moved past it.  I put the DVD in and it stopped suddenly after the introduction.  I pressed play again.  The first section started up, ok... now we're making progress.  But, every third phrase section on the DVD had garbled audio so I couldn't hear all the phrases.  So much for that.

But wait, there's more!  There's an included PC/Mac software disc.  I installed the Mac software.  When I ran it, it asked me which language(s) and phrases I wanted to install.  uh, don't you know?  I selected a couple of sections of French to install off the Disc.  Then program died and I needed to force quit it.

The good news is that it was cheap and over quickly.  Now I'm trying a Learn a Language in 10 Days course.  It's about the same price but there's no software to install or DVDs to watch.  It's just audio which I can install on my iPod.  Look up pimsleurapproach and I hope we have better luck than this wonderful product.",1362268800,,974,4.346368715083799
8047066,1,B0007DBB8A,Not at all what I expected hard to understand french phrase only said once and once is obviously not enough to hear the pronounciation. The topics are useless and way too long. I was expecting simple phrases such as where why how much please thankyou etc nothing of this. A waste of money as far as I am concerned it will probably end up in the bin.,1328400000,,349,4.223880597014926
8047067,4,B0007DBB8A,This is very basic. I wanted something more in depth; but very easy to learn from.,1167955200,,82,4.1875
8047068,1,B0007DBB8A,"I have been learning languages for many years and had different kinds of video, DVD language courses. This French 101 is, unfortunately, my biggest disappointment. It's just repetition of vocabulary in a very boring and very slow way which is not effective as much as you expect. I hope I will be able to return it.",1161129600,3,315,4.642857142857143
8047069,5,B0007DBB8A,"Hi...I was going to France for a few weeks and had no prior knowledge of the language...a friend turned me on the Travel Linguist series and I found it extremely helpful. The native speakers especially helped my pronunciation, and paired with the phoenetic spellings I developed a better understanding of French pronunciation in general (no small feat for an English speaker). It's easy to use and divided into chapters so you can learn at your own pace and be gradually challenged with speed and new vocabulary. I really recommend this product!",1130889600,7,545,5.0
8047070,1,B0007DBB8A,"Don't waste your money. This is boring, repetitive (in a bad way) and slow. Try a Standard Deviants language dvd instead, I got both and SD rocks and is fun to learn from.",1129593600,5,171,4.212121212121212
8047071,5,B0007DBB8A,My family is hosting a French exchange student for the summer and she was impressed with the French words and phrases we already knew when she arrived.  This is a very simple DVD that teaches basic French words and phrases.  It won't teach you complicated grammar but if you're just starting to learn French this will get you started.,1122595200,13,334,4.6440677966101696
