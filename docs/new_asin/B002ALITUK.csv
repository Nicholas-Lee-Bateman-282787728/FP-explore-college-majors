3886433,5,B002ALITUK,"I bought 7 DVDs and one book (incl CD) at Amazon, where two were double DVDs - all ""learning how to play the mandolin"" type of DVDs.
I am super satisfied. Perfect price and delivery time! I received a 100 dollar TAX/VAT bill for the package, but still it was 165 dollar cheaper than in Norway.. Not to promote shopping out of your country, but if there is something special you need, and you can find it on the internet, try makin' a bargain once in a while!!

On this DVD you can hear Mr Ronnie McCory and Del McCory playing a fantastic tune together. This track alone makes this DVD worth its money!! Pluss a bunch of good extra tracks.

This is my second time buying stuff from Amazon. Nice store!

8359719,5,B002ALITUK,"This is a sampler DVD with excerpts from some of their best selling mandolin, instructional DVDs by Homespun.  I have the Great Bluegrass Guitar Lessons as well.

Learning from nine different teachers can seem disjointed but this composite DVD gives the viewer a wide exposure to the range of lessons and different styles and teachers available through Homespun tapes.  There is something for everybody and they endeavor to offer easy lessons for beginners, and more advanced lessons for those at higher levels.  All of the lessons are great and are worth working on.  My favorite so far is Norman Blake's teaching of the Civil War fiddle song, ""John Brown's March""; beautiful melody that is not difficult to learn.  Norman is a patient and good teacher. I am very satisfied with the DVD if that is all I do with it but, I am sure to complete the other lessons as well.

This DVD is something of an advertisement, as there is a $5 discount should you decide to buy any of the full length DVDs that are excepted here.  Also, the DVD comes with a full tablature of the lessons that can be viewed on your computer, or downloaded.",1381795200,6,1126,4.623115577889447
8359720,3,B002ALITUK,"repackaged from other mandolin dvd tutorials, so if you have already invested in some of these dvd tutorials you will find that you have already paid for some of these lessons already",1370476800,,183,4.75
8359721,5,B002ALITUK,"Further, you get the personal reasons and feeling of why nine people like the mandolin, and the incredibly different ways to feel about playing",1360972800,,143,5.0
8359722,5,B002ALITUK,"This is an excellent intermediate lesson video. I find it extremely informative and fun to watch! I pick up 80 percent of music by ear so the video wasn't intimidating to learn from but for those who need a visual aid on paper, the DVD has a PDF Booklet you can print out. I know someone said on here they found it frustrating that the dvd didn't come with a booklet but that's just not true. Pop it in to your computer, open the DVD without running it's contents and you'll see a file for the booklet. That's where you find the materials necessary to follow along. I'll take this DVD over any paid instructor any day. If you want to be taught by some of the best mandolin players in the world, buy this DVD!",1347235200,7,708,4.213235294117647
8359723,4,B002ALITUK,"The only thing that would have made this item even better, or completely fantastic is if they could have included the documents from each of the master's instructional series.  It is a little frustrating to hear them talk about the text references while they're giving advice and of course being able to see the music while they're playing would have made their techniques even more concrete.",1333152000,7,392,4.9393939393939394
8359724,5,B002ALITUK,"Must have for any aspiring mandolin players. Probably need a little stringed instrument experience, as in using a pick or plectrum, but there is a virtual plethora of information here. In actual lessons it's probably worth 10 times this amount.",1329782400,4,244,5.125
8359725,5,B002ALITUK,"not for the beginner, only because you have to know your chords already. but if you know your chords it will teach you some great riffs, and diffrent styles on the mandolin. Very easy learning, great teaching, they slow evrything down. This was for my twelve year old son who had just learned his chords he loves it.",1269907200,20,316,4.4655172413793105
