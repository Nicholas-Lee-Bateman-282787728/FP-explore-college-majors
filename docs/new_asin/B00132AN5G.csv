8326607,5,B00132AN5G,"I was struggling, trying to make my first slip cover, for a sofa, no less.  What was I thinking? With out this tape, I would have wasted not only the cost of the fabric, but a lot of time and suffered a lot of frustration.  With help from a more experienced friend and the benefit of this tape, I completed the cover and I must say, it looks pretty good. Clare Driscoll, the 'master' was precise in her directions, and very understandable.  Somethings, like tuck ins, still need a little trial and error practice.  Good luck!",1297814400,,525,4.4375
