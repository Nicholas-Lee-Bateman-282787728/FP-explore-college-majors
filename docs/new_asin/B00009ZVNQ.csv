7994690,5,B00009ZVNQ,"I had the Hoober-Bloob Highway when I was a kid and saw the ads for the Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and ALWAYS wanted to see it.  I was looking for good clean, non-violent movies for my three year old and came across an old favorite!  Still love this movie and the one I hadn't seen is cute too!  Can't wait to get the Lorax!  Great price, perfect condition, arrived really fast!",1301529600,,386,4.175675675675675
7994691,5,B00009ZVNQ,The Dr. Seuss vs. Cat in the Hat feud represents the modern workplace in many ways.  There is always someone who possesses vast technological knowledge trying to get one over on the happy simple guy.  That is all I can think of to write about right now.,1264204800,,253,4.361702127659575
7994692,3,B00009ZVNQ,"The case boasts of the shows being re-mastered, but there are streaks in the backgrounds from negative fading.
These are the later 1980's Depatie-Freling TV specials, not the classic Chuck Jones cartoons. (The Jones toons are issued by Warner Brothers).  They have their creative moments, but much of the time they feel like cheap imitations of Dr. Seuss.
The Hoober-Bloob Highway is the superior of the two shorts.
Why only two 22 minute shorts? Universal could have gotten all four of their Dr. Seuss DVD releases on one DVD!",1070323200,15,527,4.921348314606742
7994693,4,B00009ZVNQ,"What I am writing is a continuation of my last review.  I actually have seen The Hoober-Bloob Highway"" and just did not take in the name of this cartoon while seeing it on television.  I am giving it four stars up since I did not find it quite as enjoyable as ""The Grinch Grinches The Cat In The Hat.""  Anyway, the cartoon deals a man in space who has taken the place of stalks (that myhtical baby delivery method) so he can help them make decisions about how to begin and live through their earthly lives before sending them down there along his hoober-bloob highway.  However, you will only see him dealing with one particular baby whom he tries to advise with a great deal of trouble while showing it some films of what might occur on earth.  He even ends up giving the baby boy the option of not going down to earth.  The production is not necessarily adventurous since it involves decision-making rather than physical struggles.",1066608000,,933,4.523809523809524
