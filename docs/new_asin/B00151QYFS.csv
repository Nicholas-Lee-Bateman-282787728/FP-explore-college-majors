3139338,5,B00151QYFS,"This is a great comedy for men and women of any age.  There are plenty of laughs for Adams Fans from his other shows like Loveline, The Man Show and his Morning Radio show.  But it also has a wide appeal for those who may not be familiar with Carolla.  Very funny without relying on movie cliches like most other comedies made recently.  It has a fun and uplifting story with excellent and genuine performances from every role.

A great Romantic Comedy, perfect for dates and couples.  No matter who you are you will find something to enjoy in this movie.

Also don't fear the R rating.  It has 2 F Bombs that are in context and not vulgar.  There is no violence other than some boxing.  No sex, nudity or suggestive conversation.  No gross out humor or anything offensive for that matter.  unless you are super uptight you won't find anything in here that you would feel uncomfortable showing your 10 year old.

if you don't buy it, at least do yourself a favor and rent it.  But you'll probably end up buying it later if you rent it.",1212019200,15,1035,4.378947368421053
3139339,5,B00151QYFS,"When I saw this in the theatre, also watching it with me were men and women in their mid-20s to senior citizens.  Everyone laughed throughout.  It appeals to both male and female sensibilities.  If you enjoy good cinema, you'll love this one.",1212019200,6,242,4.714285714285714
3139340,5,B00151QYFS,"I saw this movie about four times in theaters, not because I am a Ace Corolla fan(which I am) but because this is a great movie.  We live in a day and age where crappy movies make millions (good luck chuck?) and a great movie like the Hammer could not find the founding to be put into more than twenty theaters.  This is a great movie and Adam Corolla holds his own in this movie.

The general story is one most people can relate to, a middle aged guy whose life has lead him to one dead end after another.  One day he gets a second change to make something of himself in the boxing ring and decides to take a chance one more time.  Finding rivalry, friendship and a new love this movie has everything a person could want in a GOOD comedy.
It stars Adam Corolla and his real life friend Ozzy in a great movie to watch on a Saturday night.  A movie for ALL AGES even thought it does have a R rating it is more a PG that a R movie.  Most people recognize the Ace Man from The Man Show or Love Line but this movie is a polar opposite romantic comedy about one man trying to do one last thing with his life.

You may not have seen it in the theaters but own it on DVD and see that Adam Corolla is a great leading man and a true comedic great.  Peace.",1212019200,5,1246,3.952
3139341,5,B00151QYFS,"When I heard this was an independent film project by Adam Carolla, I assumed it was going to be at least fun to watch and since I'm a fan of Adam I decided to support him by watching this movie. Let me just say that this movie is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Make no mistake with The Hammer, it wasn't simply ""better than expected"", it is genuinely a great movie, very funny, and very fun to watch.

It's the perfect movie to buy on DVD, because many people haven't seen or heard of it, so when you've got people over at the house looking at your DVD collection, The Hammer is one you're going to convince them to watch every time.",1208908800,62,647,4.134920634920635
3139342,5,B00151QYFS,"Carolla and Juergensen have a hit here!  The Hammer, loosely based on Adam Carolla's real life as a simple carpenter -- before the his top-rated morning radio show, before his turning-point friendship with now Tonight Show host Jimmy Kimmel, before The Man Show -- is an authentic view into the dreams, doubts and struggles of an average guy trying to make a better life for himself in the tough world of boxing without losing his ethics. Carolla's trademark wit will keep you laughing through the entire movie; the boxing scenes provide enough action for guys; Juergensen as the smart love interest hits just the right note; the entire film simply amuses, delights and charms. Buy This Classic Movie! You will love it regardless of whether you know who Carolla is. I just saw this movie Friday and can't stop smiling and recommending it. Mainstream reviews are uniformly positive; Ebert & gave it 2 thumbs way up!",1206403200,58,914,4.858974358974359

3139349,5,B00151QYFS,"It's not a big-budget film, but it's got a lot to offer content-wise. Kinda-sorta it's romantic comedy, but Carolla's artistic style seems to emphasize the process of achievement as an underdog, such that the ""coming out a winner"" is the ""getting the girl"" rather than actual winning the heart of a woman. This style element didn't harm my ability to enjoy the film since the romance is symbolic more than a driver of plot. Carolla is rightly celebrated for his rags-to-riches fame in his personal life, so it suits him to make stories surrounding the kinds of trials that have carried him to the success everyone wants. As a native of the area where this film is shot, I appreciated the Hollywood/Glendale locations. It established an important feel to the film, and cements Carolla's brand. The Oswoldo character is of tremendous value comedically, and functions not unlike Pedro in Napoleon Dynamite. However, his overly thick accent may frustrate some viewers. It's intentional, of course, to have Oswoldo barely able to communicate in English &agrave; la Manuel in Fawlty Towers. Since there was likely no budget for dialogue replacement, the ideal level of unintelligibility may not have been achieved. Watch Road Hard if you enjoyed this. Familiar themes for Carolla fans and just the thing to watch on a plane.",1504569600,,1318,5.0228310502283104

3139352,5,B00151QYFS,"I'm an Adam Carolla fanatic. I've been following his work since the late 90's when he was doing Lovelines and the Man Show. I'm perpetually impressed with his material and output. His recent documentaries are amazing! While I didn't love his second movie, ""Road Hard"" as much, this movie was a surprise charmer.

It's got a few bumps in the road but overall it's a solid, feel-good movie with great writing and Mr. Carolla's signature acerbic wit and style. It's worth the watch for the Jane Lynch scene alone. The romantic elements move the story forward in a heart-felt way without making you want to puke in your mouth.

Overall, if you are an Adam Carolla fan, you're in for a treat. I would recommend this to anyone in the mood for something charming, funny and a little edgy.",1499990400,,781,4.611510791366906

But not all all, it was about relationships, friendships and doing the right thing with boxing as a foundation to the plot. I enjoyed all the little one liners, Adam did a great job on his deliveries and I was really impressed with his boxing chops.

That comfort zone makes things believable and definitely relatable to the 40 something trying to figure out where the hell do I go from here.  Of course parts of the movie could have been done better, but if you appreciate the blunt humor of Carolla this movie delivers its $5 worth, and gives you a reason to drink a couple beers.",1434672000,,513,4.446808510638298

It's not the outrageous, visceral humor that you'd see in a Ted or Hangover (which are both very, very funny), but it's a laugh riot nonetheless. But as funny as it is, it's got an inspirational, uplifting story driving it all. If you're hitting that point in your life where you're down about the choices you've made, the things you've done -- or haven't done -- The Hammer will make you want to pick yourself up and give you the gumption to Get It On .... because there's no choice but to Get It On -- Mandate: Get It On!",1433721600,,627,4.367521367521367

That being said, his subtle humor and body language may give you a false impression as to his true ""wheel spinning"" brain. He see's the world in a very pragmatic way and in so doing he derives his creative juices in a way that the average ""Joe"" may not quite get! That being said, look for the little things in the human interaction that most people don't see or care to see. Then you may experience the genius of his film art.",1427328000,,486,4.236559139784946

3139465,2,B00151QYFS,"I love Adam but geez he sure ain't an actor. What's funny is he would be the first one to mock guys for being surrounded by ""yes men"" who just won't tell you that you don't come off genuine on screen (at all) yet he is clearly surrounded by them. The movie did have some good jokes and I just love Adams pov but mercy this movie just didn't work for me and it had everything to do with adams acting. He just released Road Hard and is complaining pretty heavily about getting bad reviews and I think it's laughable that he just refuses to believe that it's possible he might not be what he thinks he is onscreen. Don't even get me started with the final scene of the Hammer. Yuck....I think I could do more with my iPhone and a couple buddies. Adam would tear me a new one if he read this im sure but he'd prob take the high road and say I'm not worth getting upset over and do or say anything to give the impression he doesn't care about little people like me (like he always does) but there are some of us out here who can see through the facade and know that your every moment is spent trying to justify yourself in the eyes of the one who you think matter. Hahahaha, we all matter Adam, even little ole me. Little ole going nowhere pos me. I love it, at least I've given him what he wants. a preconceived opinion of him which I based this review on.....hahaha.....now he can write me off because the movie wasn't what I said it was, I just have some vendetta against him.

He was a carpenter, boxer, comedian and lover ::SNIFF:: (Carolla fans will get what the sniff means).  Adam's real life friend Ozzie is a great addition to the movie.  He has no acting experience but some how plays a great part, he barely speaks English in real life so this seems even more impressive.

This movie loosely follows his life story up until the point where his career took off.  It is well written and funny throughout.

The story and setting are heart warming realistic regular guy places and situations, and the moral of the story is that heart and hard work are never wasted.  See this movie.  There are no car chases, silly jokes or dead end plot lines.  Get away from the billion dollar computer generated blockbusters for an hour and a half and see a real movie with some good comedy, real life drama and actual human beings being human beings.

Is it a special-effects extravaganza?  Nope.  And it's still perfect.  One of my favorite movies in recent memory.

Hollywood should take lessons from Mr. Carolla.  Period.",1382572800,,367,5.315789473684211

Great flick, can watch with your significant other.  Cant say enough about it.",1382054400,,344,4.151515151515151

3139626,5,B00151QYFS,"How this movie didn't get more press at it's original release, I'm not sure. This is definitely a classic film, with Carolla giving one of his best performances ever. The experiences in this movie are based off of Adam's real life construction jobs in the 90's. Oswaldo, one of the characters in the movie, is played by Adam's buddy that he met on the construction site.

The story is one of the best sports underdog films to ever come out. Can't write enough positives about this movie. Do yourself a favor, no matter what your opinion on the man show, or Carolla's other works, RENT THIS MOVIE. It's certified 'fresh' on rotten tomatoes, so you know it's good.",1380844800,,662,4.610169491525424

3139630,4,B00151QYFS,Good movie - very funny dialog. Adam Carolla's monotone delivery of sarcasm is top shelf.

This is a great small movie and proves, once again, that a good film is good because of the story it tells not the CGI, FX, or celebrity of the cast.  Mr. Carolla takes the themes of his life (if you know his other work) and creates a compelling story about a loser who becomes a success. The film works because while the message of the movie is serious, Carolla tells his story with great humanity and humor. There is a short jump roping scene that is simply one of funniest 60 seconds ever captured on film. The two main characters are likable and believable.  The supporting characters are, to some extent, caricatures.  But, they serve the purpose of moving the story forward.  Oswaldo Castillo is hilarious and a brilliant piece of casting by Mr. Carolla.",1379116800,,860,4.452229299363057

I always thought Carolla was a bit of a stiff on the ""Man Show"", the I saw ""The Adam Carolla Project"" and I understand a little more that he is just a guy, he was not professionally trained but rather came up through rough carpentry and working his ass off.  I never knew he boxed until I saw this show.  He has a lot of great stuff in here, my only criticism is that he seems to try to get all his material in this one movie.  There is some bad language but otherwise I would feel perfectly comfortable watching this with my kids.

3139706,5,B00151QYFS,"I really wasn't that surprised that The Hammer turned out as good as it did. I know some of the criticism that's been laid out is that Carolla just plays himself. I'm not gonna disagree with that fact on the whole. He's basically taken a number of facts and times from his personal life and experiences to build this character. That doesn't make the story any less interesting or fun. A lot of writers do that so the critique is essentially pointless .

I love the story of a man who at one point in his younger years was an up and coming amateur boxer with tons of talent. Could have been great if not for injuries and other curve balls life threw at him. It's a very amusing and heart warming tale to see him get back into the higher end of enjoying life and realizing some dreams of a better existence. All the while with a backstabbing manager and woman troubles on the side. I think Carolla really put together a very solid story that's very entertaining. No there aren't a ton of out loud riotous laughs, mostly some really good chuckles and a few laugh out loud moments. Whoever declared it law though that comedy couldn't be fulfilling while being more subtle and subdued? It's a genuine tale inspired by a lot of his experiences so the comedies in the reality. Watch it and decide for yourself. You might just really enjoy it.",1358553600,,1335,4.426829268292683

I think the movie is pretty sincere, and some parts are a bit ham-fisted, but not out of place.

I have one particular gripe, and that is near the end of the movie.  The fight scene would have been much more compelling and enjoyable if we didn't have the ringside announcer spoon feeding us the action on the screen complete with editorial commentary to tell us what he thinks the fighters must be feeling at this moment.  It felt very unnatural and distracting.  I think it would have meant more if we were allowed to experience the scene and draw our own conclusions.  I really wish that scene would have been reworked to cut out the chatter and speculation.

Otherwise, a fine movie, well worth seeing if you are a Carolla fan.",1356393600,,844,4.371794871794871

As a huge Adam Carolla fan, and a female (yes, we do ineed, exist) I listen to his podcast daily on iTunes  (if you don't already listen, you're really missing out). Carolla writes, stars and  helped produce this feature and it will impress you.

I know that it sounds generic, but if you like Adam Carolla, you will like The Hammer. It doesn't strive for more than it can offer, and It was really interesting getting to see the things that Adam often talks about in his podcast play out in real-life situations.

3139730,5,B00151QYFS,"My appreciation of Adam Carolla continues to rise above my first impressions in the 90's of him as a loud-mouthed twenty something on Loveline. He is building his Pirate Ship thru a ground breaking podcast empire, funny autobiographical books and live shows. He has multiple talents but his secret is the entrepreneurial gene his classmates at NHH lacked. I'm going to Seattle from Oregon to see him with Dennis Prager in Dec.  I brought some of my initial skepticism to this movie a couple years ago but it won me over with how very good it is. The writing is solid with unexpected twists which is a real feat when trying yet another boxing film. Acting is natural. In this case that means good. It obviously drawns from incidents in Adam's life and that adds to the interest if you are a fan. Recently I watched it for a second time and my positive impressions were confirmed. Ozzie, one of Adam's real life pals, is great by the way.  The film is enjoyable, funny, touching at times. In other words its a really good movie.",1353715200,,1026,4.54054054054054

The breakout scene-stealer of the movie is, of course Oswaldo ""Ozzy"" Castillo. Somehow, Castillo manages to elevate Carolla's star power to new heights.

The story soars, but is grounded in an abundance of Adam's signature sarcasm and dry humor. We see ourselves in Adam's plight as he longs for a shot at glory.

Carolla does exactly that writing about a down on his luck carpenter and evening fitness boxing instructor who comes into his own later in life. Lack of self esteem seems to have kept him check till spotted by a local trainer noticing his ""heavy left""...the hammer. Out of work and a girl friend he finds renewed inspiration in a student and a hope at making the Olympic team. Its not high art but the story is sweet and pacing is kept up with Carolla's jokes and lively patter. He is accompanied by a proud Nicaraguan named Ozzie...who, is mostly indecipherable throughout the film but steals scenes left and right. Its a sharp contrast that works Carolla's wit. It becomes a tad predictable in the end but it was well rounded and enjoyed.",1347408000,,802,4.576388888888889

After watching The Hammer, I have to say that it's pretty good! I mean he's no Daniel Day-Lewis, but it was better than 90% of movies on cable or premium channels.

The story was compelling, I empathized with the characters and bought into the story almost immediately. Adam's acting could have been a little better, sometimes he looked lazy in the ring and in the romantic scenes. Ozzie should be in more movies. And, it was very funny.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it!

With an underlying theme that talks close to home about the reality of the working world that made Adam the man he is, this movie shares a great tale of an unknown up and comer with the dream to box and the talent to do it.

Adam has built his own brand through his radio and podcast work and he is, without a doubt, the go to broadcast for understanding how and what living in LA is all about. Making the film The Hammer is an achievement that spawns from exactly what he discusses often on his show. Take an idea, not just any but a good idea, put all you've got into it and if you truly have the talent to compete - you too can create something that has value and worth.

If you're looking for a film that inspires, makes you laugh and will find it's way into your DVD player over and over, this is the one. Familiar tones to what make a great indie film along with the spice that turns a flick into a cult classic - The Hammer is, and should be, the next purchase you make for your favorites collection.

The choice of music was lousy, the romance was ""normal"" ""sane"", ""nice"" but not hot.  There were some good parts of the movie.  Ozzy was actually very funny and endearing, some of the dialogue was good, the directing was okay, it looked good for a film done on a shoestring budget,  It had a lot of heart.

Then Loveline on MTV was canceled and stopped being carried on the radio in my area. I never heard his morning show but I've found thousands of mp3s of old Loveline shows which I listen to regularly and I enjoy his podcast and have listened to it since it started. I say all of that because from that I've grown to know and like Adam. Unfortunately, while he's very funny in his rants, he's also repetitive and he can't act to save his life. If you know and like Carolla's rants, this movie is basically just a collection of some of his standard rants with a movie built around them. The rants themselves include several of his classics and are good but they feel like they've been shoehorned into the story (because they have). I should also say that while I've listened to Adam for years, I've stopped listening to his podcast simply because he is so repetitive. This movie is more of the same from Adam Carolla. Nothing really new or exciting. If you know and enjoy Adam then you'll enjoy the movie well enough, maybe even love it if you're a huge Carolla fan.

The movie is solid and is actually decent for watching with your lady. There's enough guy stuff and romance stuff to keep you both interested. I still think it's funny how Adam just employs his friends to be in all of his stuff, considering none of them are actors or comedians.

The movie is semi-autobiographical in a way, since Adam's character is a construction worker and boxing instructor while living in the San Fernando Valley, much like Adam's life was as a young adult.

He has a very casual charm, but his acerbic wit that I have come to love is very present.  This movie isn't breaking any new ground, but it's a very well done underdog story with rom-com elements.

3139785,5,B00151QYFS,"I don't know why it took me so long to buy this video. I was a devoted fan of Adam Carolla on LA's KLSX right up to day the station canned its talk format and descended into the depths of mumble music. Carolla demonstrated rapier brilliance from day he showed up on KRLA as Mr. Birchum, the hilarious gravel voiced shop teacher that you would never want your kid to spend an hour with. From there to Love Line, bouts with TV's Man Show, and finally to the morning radio slot vacated by the vastly self-over-rated Howard Stern. Although he takes wicked pleasure in detailing his misspent youth--how do you flunk out of junior college really?--Carolla has impeccable creds to make a movie about a struggling carpenter taking one last shot at boxing glory. Carolla has carpentered and he has boxed, both for real. ""Hammer"" is an inspired concept that captures both pursuits in a single word.

Since taking possession of the DVD, I've watched it with various groups of people. Everyone without exception has enjoyed it. You don't need to love or even approve of boxing to get caught up in the story, which has an ending that is fitting but not predictable, moving but not gooey. Carolla has gone on record that he never expects the Hammer to make a dime of profit. I'm happy to have contributed a few bucks toward reducing the deficit. And I can't wait for his next venture.",1270512000,,1370,4.591836734693878

3139804,3,B00151QYFS,"The main problem with The Hammer is that it is so thoroughly mediocre.  It's purportedly a comedy, but it's not very funny.  Most of the humor is supposed to come from Adam Carolla's signature rants that have been awkwardly shoe-horned into the script, but it rarely works.  Carolla, while a legitimately funny media personality, is also a very, very bad actor, and he never comes off as anything other than stilted and ineffective in the leading role.  The plot is overly contrived, and the supposedly ""witty"" dialogue is consistently ho-hum.  The film does work on the level of being a relationship movie, but here again, while it's not terrible, it also can't be construed as good.

If you're desperate for something to watch, you could do worse, but you could also do a lot better than this.  Skip it.",1267142400,,805,4.748201438848921

Some people compare this movie to Rocky because it is a boxing movie, I would compare it more to ""Tin Cup"", but with boxing instead of golf.  It's a nice romantic comedy with good boxing scenes.  We were woken up early by the daughter at 3am.  She was up for the day, so I snuck one by the goalie, and talked the lady into finally seeing the movie.  She might have liked the movie more than I did, and she hated Carolla.  She was won over by it, and even was telling her friends to see the movie.

I hope Adam makes more movies.  This movie came out in limited release right before Valentine's day.  This would have been a good movie to come out right before Valentine's day.

The story is simple Carolla plays a regular guy who doesn't apply himself and hasn't had much success financially or emotionally. He gets a second chance after his girlfriend leaves him and a boxing manager sees something in him.

The film works because Carolla eases up on his usual attics and plays a very likable guy and the relationship between him and Juergensen is realistic.

The plot is remarkably simple, so I won't spoil it by mentioning it here. The strength of the movie is the simplicity of the message and how genuinely it was conveyed. The cast did a wonderful job, and Adam's humor turns the most mundane scenes into the highlights of the movie.

Some will dismiss Adam Carolla as a racist and thereby assuming everything he did was racist. There was a few lines of racial slur and stereotypes, but the movie is filled with sincere inter-racial friendship, and any rational person would be able to see that Adam Carolla uses race as a topic of harmless humor.

The good news is, he certainly didn't disappoint. It was a well-written and believable story filled with interesting characters and clever plot lines. Adam's ad-libbing was even better than expected and his love interest, played by Heather Jeurgensen, is cute, funny and poignant in all the right places. The cherry picking of quirks and pet peeves from the real life Adam Carolla really fleshed out the Ferro character and the use of Adam's personal handyman, Oswaldo Castillo, made for laughs throughout.",1246060800,,849,5.0212765957446805

Carolla's a pretty funny guy, quick-witted and self-deprecating, so that the movie has its share of funny is a gimme - but, hey, that it would also have heart? I wasn't expecting that. Adam Carolla plays the down-and-out Jerry Ferro, an ex-Golden Gloves boxer and now a struggling unlicensed carpenter - although he holds evening boxing classes at the local gym. Jerry's 40th birthday drops like the hammer of doom, the same day landing him a scuffle with his boss which then loses him his construction gig and his fed-up girlfriend. But he gets a second shot at his boxing dream when he's invited to the Olympic boxing tryouts. Surprisingly, Jerry also gets a second shot at romance. All his life, Jerry has found ways to eff up his life. How's he gonna mess this one up?

THE HAMMER - Jerry Ferro's boxing nickname, not because he's a handyman but because of the pop in his left hand - is one of those innocuous-looking films you accidentally pause on while you're flipping thru channels but then end up sticking around for until the closing credits. Even though Carolla's character is an unmitigated slacker, this is a film which espouses that blue collar perspective. Even if the story itself is predictable, Carolla's low key yet spot-on performance drives the thing. I've never perceived him as the endearing sort, but as world-weary loser Jerry Ferro, Carolla right away pulls you into his corner. Me, I very quickly ended up caring what happens to Jerry Ferro. THE HAMMER is touted as a comedic underdog sports flick, but, thanks to Carolla and Heather Juergensen's chemistry, it's also a surprisingly touching romantic movie.

Carolla and the good-natured Oswaldo Castillo have been long time friends in real life and they do good things together in the film. The scenes with Jerry Ferro and his loyal best bud Ozzy (Castillo) are terrific and very funny and surprisingly heartfelt (and at this point I should probably stop using the word ""surprisingly""). THE HAMMER is very funny, with much of the humor coming from Carolla's riffs and drily delivered one-liners. However, some of the situational comedy are gold, such as when the Hammer is already wrapped and gloved up but then needing to use the bathroom or the scene with the rousing ""Eye of the Tiger"" anthem playing on as Ferro keeps on hitting his alarm clock's snooze button. And word to the wise if you're a fan of the La Brea Tar Pits, Ferro relentlessly bags on that place on his day date with the public defender cutie (""The La Brea Tar Pits? Wow, this date's officially been downgraded to a field trip."").

Carolla used to be a carpenter and a boxing instructor so both fields are ably represented here. I must say that Adam Carolla is convincing as a has-been, aging boxer. And Jerry Ferro seems to be a cat who, even when immersed in the boxing world, still can't help but wax knowledgeable on all things home improvement-y. This even lands him in trouble with a power puncher named Malice Blake (real life pugilist Jeff Lacy who, by the way, used to be good but now needs to hang it up). Ferro's ""toggle bolts"" rant lands him in the squared circle with Malice, in which Ferro takes his lumps but then unleashes a left hook (or maybe it was a left cross) and knocks down Malice. As a longtime boxing fan, this scene is ironic to me because Jeff Lacy's nickname is ""Left Hook."" Anyway, it's his one punch pummelling of Malice which ushers Ferro back to the world of competitive boxing. I like that this film is riddled with plenty of feel-good underdog moments like that.

His ex-partner Jimmy Kimmel may have the higher profile, but Adam Carolla's no slouch in the wiseacre department. I've watched him regularly on the raunchy Man Show and listened to his popular radio show for a long while now (although, sadly, his radio show's gone kaput). Carolla's been on various television shows, but THE HAMMER is his first lead role on the big screen and he makes the most of it. If you want to see a funny movie that's more than just a funny movie, if you want to see another side of Adam Carolla - a more introspective side - and if you want to see a bit (not a lot, just a bit) of behind-the-scenes stuff in the world of the sweet science, then give THE HAMMER a try. I guarantee you'll stay the full round.",1242000000,2,4548,4.602959309494452
3139822,5,B00151QYFS,I have become a fan of Adam Carolla - specifically in his radio days after taking over after Howard.  This movie is hysterical and is a great flick.  Its classic Adam!,1236902400,,167,4.354838709677419

3139826,5,B00151QYFS,"I listen to Carolla on the radio every day and every guest compliments Adam on the Hammer.  My first thought was they were a bunch of kiss ups and there was no way this unknown movie could be any good.  Well my curiosity got the best of me and I bought the movie.

First the movie is low budget, but comes across as well produced independent.  The movie appears to be shot on location at several areas and was well done.  The acting was somewhat cheesey but Carolla is not a movie star and held his own.

The plot has been mentioned in every review and nothing to add.  The movie is about a down and out carpenter who gets a chance to realize his dreams and change his life around.  It is a feel good movie and worth your time and money.  The guests were telling the truth the Hammer is a good movie, lets hope Mr. Carolla has an opportunity to do another movie.",1234396800,,862,4.144578313253012

Or the date montage(s) with the new love interest...ugh, extra cheesy!
The movie isn't awful. It's a great story about someone taking a risk and going after what they want.
It just has some cheesy roll your eyes moments.

3139829,5,B00151QYFS,"How often does a film come along where myself, a Carolla fan who's not offended by anyone/thing, my female friends not into sports, and my 81 year old mother who dislikes nudity, cussing, and violence, all come to love together? This is it. As Adam says, the R-rating was due to, I believe, one 'bad' word uttered once. Overall this was a truly original film, maybe not in terms of the storyline and procedure, but due to the fact it has universal appeal to everyone and can be serious, inspirational, and full of comedy, while never pandering to any emotion. I, being a Carolla fan know of his humor, but a lot of others may only have heard of him and think he is dirty, sexist, raunchy, etc... a la Howard Stern. But those of us who know his full gamut of thought, also a la Stern, know there is much more there. While many other films capture certain themes or emotions as well or better, The Hammer captures them all masterfully into a widely and wildly entertaining 90 minutes of near-perfect entertainment. And one step further, as one other reviewer noted, I bought a 'gift' copy for a friend, sent the jacket to Adam's radio show, and got a personally signed copy back in time for an Xmas gift. What a great surprise and due to it's limited theatrical release hopefully others can get a chance to experience a great entertainment joy in the aftermarket world of DVD.",1231459200,,1374,4.522088353413655
3139830,5,B00151QYFS,"""The Hammer"" is a funny movie that only gets better as it goes along.  This is a great ""Date Night"" dvd.  It has strong comedy chops while carrying a humble love story plot line.  Warm, funny and fuzzy.  A good time.",1229731200,,216,4.195121951219512
3139831,4,B00151QYFS,"This is a very likeable, root-for-the-underdog, feel-good movie that everyone can like.  One could mistakenly think that was a description of ""The Karate Kid,"" but it applies equally well to ""The Hammer.""

In fact, there are many parallels between ""Karate Kid"" and ""The Hammer.""  They both have underdog fighters as their protagonists, they both have boy-meets-girl love stories, they both have wisecracking older fighters mentoring a younger fighter, and they both culminate in fight tournament, feel-good climaxes.  And while neither movie is high art, they are both lighthearted, humor-filled romps that stand up to repeated viewings.

The protagonist, Jerry Ferro, is played by Adam Carolla, and is loosely based upon his own experiences as a carpenter/boxing instructor before he broke into the entertainment industry on ""Loveline"" and ""The Man Show.""  Imagine Karate Kid's Daniel-san becoming a 40-year old, sharing all his Miyagi-taught wisdom with a younger fighter, while simultaneously training for a comeback fight tournament, and you have a basic template for Ferro.

Thanks to his real life boxing background, Carolla brings a great sense of realism to the boxing, and especially the rope skipping scenes.  His dramatic skills aren't as impressive, though one could argue that Ferro is intentionally written to emulate Carolla's real life, semi-stiff affect.  If that was the intent, then I'd have to concede that Carolla's performance is spot-on perfect (since it wouldn't be an act at all).  In any case, half of Ferro's lines are Carolla-isms delivered in his real life comedian style, so this slightly weak link is generally not noticeable.

In ""The Karate Kid,"" the weakest link is probably the boy-girl love story.  ""The Hammer,"" on the other hand, has a pretty compelling love story thanks to great writing, and a strong performance by the love interest played by Heather Juergensen.  And it's really hard to not admire ""the candle scene"" (I won't make this a spoiler by saying any more than that).

That being said, the movie's greatest strength is its humor.  You rarely have to go more than a minute or two between laughs.  A movie that sends you on your way with a belly full of laughs, and a warm fuzzy feeling about underdogs catching a break is a can't-miss combo.  Like I said earlier, this is not high art, so I'm giving it 4-stars instead of 5.  But don't let that deter you from seeing this -- Karate Kid is also only 4-stars, and you sure wouldn't want to have missed that one, right?",1229731200,,2516,5.021686746987951

A surprisingly engaging romance along with some laugh out loud moments make this one movie that will leave you smiling from start to finish.

There is extremely limited promotion for this film, so that really was the only way to hear bout this movie. I decided to check it out on DVD since it never came to the NJ area via film, and I must say it was well worth the purchase. It had lots of laughs, a few sentimental moments, and a well written script. Carolla plays a great role in a very interesting and quirky movie. It proves that there is more to him than being the second banana to Jimmy Kimmel on The Man Show",1219622400,,569,4.089285714285714

Wonderfully balanced with a nice blend of humor, love, work ethic and just plain entertainment value.
I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't waiting for the pyrotechnics, bare breasts or gratuitious use of the ""F"" word.
I only wonder why it's rated R...except that it isn't distributed by the big guns...who can buy a rating.  This thing should be PG.

He has a natural presence and somehow creates interest and laughs without seeming to try at all.  Heather Juergensen is a perfect romantic lead, charming and adorable, pretty, but thankfully not just Barbie doll eye-candy.  Adam is not an actor, but there are worse performers to spend an hour and a half with.  Adam's never terribly dynamic, but his wisecracks and his gift for carefully observed and well told complaints is without peer.  I'm a boxing fan, but I don't think one needs to like boxing to enjoy this film.  One may need to like Adam Carolla.

His rants were enjoyable, the concepts for some of the jokes were really unique and some of the scenes were laugh-out-loud funny.  Also, the boxing scenes were top notch.  What really made the movie work was Adam's relationship with Ozzie.  One can tell they are friends off-screen just by the way they interacted throughout the film.

3139854,4,B00151QYFS,"I found out about this movie completely by accident, while searching Amazon for items related to Adam Carolla, of whom I am a big fan.  I knew nothing about this movie before seeing it, and to tell the truth my expectations were quite low.

The movie is, however, much better than I would have thought.  Fans of Adam Carolla will have little to complain about, as the movie features great doses of his characteristic black wit.  The script is also quite decent.

The movie is not without its problems, however.  It asks the viewer to take it seriously in areas where it really has no business doing so.

First of all, Adam Carolla is one of those people like Steve Martin or Conan O'Brien, who have been sarcastic wags in the public eye so effectively and for so long that by this point it's impossible to take them seriously in a formal dramatic role.  And that's the surprising part about this movie: by and large it is a straight movie, complete with a romantic interest and an uplifting ending.  I was fully expecting the movie to have some sort of bitter, misanthropic conclusion; what I was not expecting was that the movie in many respects would be so conventional and straightforward.  And when you have a guy like Adam Carolla who has spent so much of his professional career spouting off on subjects as unsavory as bodily fluids and nether regions, it's virtually impossible to let the movie work whatever effect it was aiming at.

The other area in which it is difficult to take the movie seriously is a core plot point: the fact that the aging Carolla is in fact a gifted boxer and invariably strikes down formidable foes is, well, a bit tough to swallow.  Once or twice would have been okay, but dozens and dozens in a row?  That was getting ridiculous, and the sight of it made it difficult to take the movie seriously in other areas.

So, in conclusion, not a great film but one certainly worth two hours of your time.  If you're a Carolla fan, however, it's worth watching twice just so you can get the full dollop of his wit.",1217721600,,2042,4.495934959349594

Adam's impressive rope-skipping is fun to watch and there was a very cool fight scene where some of the action was shot from ground level to show off boxing footwork.

Everyone I know who watched the movie liked it. They all seemed to laugh more than I did, though, and I think I know why: I'm too big an Adam fan.  I listen to The Adam Carolla Show way more than is probably good for me, and since there was no advertising budget for this movie, there were a few months of ""Hammer"" bombardment where audio drops from the movie were played over and over until some of the jokes were ""F'ed out"" as Adam would say.

The material is mature and handled with utter grace but Adam Carolla, who if you consider his body of work, delivers a performance worthy of recognition. It's subtle, nuanced and self deprecating in a way that makes you want to root for the underdog. I've recommended this to all my friends because it's a a great little film that should have seen a wider theatrical release. If this is the kind of material that Adam has been looking to do his entire career I believe he's better suited for it. If you're thinking it's going to  be an outlandish comedy based on ""crank yankers"", ""the man show"" or ""drawn together"" you're going to be disappointed, this is a solid romantic comedy and the first performance from Adam that not only represents his true maturity level but honors his abilities as a dramatic and comedic actor at the same time. It's a must buy from me.

PS- the R rating was completely unwarrented. Children of about 10 would be able to enjoy this movie with no problem.",1217203200,2,1194,4.523148148148148

I decided to give the movie a try after repeatedly hearing him pat himself on the back about how good it was and how it didn't get any bad reviews. Well, I was highly disappointed to say the least. If you like predictable movies and bad acting, you'll love this movie! The only redeeming quality(and thus a second star for my review) is the leading lady, played by Heather Juergensen. She is very charming, but unfortunately, couldn't save the movie on her own. Please don't waste your time/money on this film, if only to dissuade Adam from acting in the future!

For the months leading up to the DVD release, there was a long line of guests on his show and listeners who would call in and rave about how hillarious it was, so I was really expecting something great.  Also, Adam played quite a few clips from the movie on his radio show over the months before the DVD came out.  So by the time the DVD came out, I felt like I had already seen it.  Most of the jokes were observations that Adam has already ranted about on his show, and with all of the clips I'd heard, I didn't feel like there was a whole lot of new material for me.  I'm sure I would have liked it a lot more if I had never listened to Adam before as it all would have been new material for me.  With that said, it is a good movie, and there are some parts that will make you laugh out loud.  I think it is a great way for people to meet Adam for the first time, fall in love with his humor, and then be converted to his radio show.

All of us liked the movie and its hard to get us all to agree on anything.
It's 3 weeks later and I still remember some good scenes! It was very entertaining and insightful despite the negative connotations the former co-host of The Man Show might have on this movie. The Man Show was high brow humor about a low brow subject. With The Hammer, you get high brow comedy about a former boxer coming of age.

I'm puzzled as to why it was rated R, with only two uses of the f-bomb, no sexual content, and no graphic violence.

3139880,3,B00151QYFS,"I have been a fan of Adam Carolla since he sat alongside Dr. Drew on the radio show ""Love Line.""  I listened to him from the first day he was on Dr. Drew's show until he left to move on to bigger and better things for himself.  I even sat in the audience of his TV show ""The Man Show"" which I really enjoyed.  However, I have to say much to Adam's chagrin that he is a lousy actor.  He is too much of a stiff in front of the camera and always has been.  His acting in ""The Hammer"" is ""NO"" exception.

My guess has to be that the other people who left an overwhelming positive review here on Amazon for ""The Hammer"" must certainly be his pals in Hollywood.  The idea of Adam portraying a carpenter and a boxer is so ridiculous because if you know Adam you know that he used to work as a carpenter and met Jimmy Kimmel while giving him boxing lessons.  Suffice to say that there was no need to make an effort here where Adam had to research his character for the movie since he is essentially in a role as himself.

Adam, I really like your work in radio and I strongly believe that that is where you need to keep yourself.  You have a very quick wit and your salt of the earth comedy leaves me in stitches.  Sorry Adam, but this is my honest opinion and it pains me because I really wanted to like your movie.

I just bumped my rating up to three stars today because when I wrote this comment 5 years ago I did not realize that I was stating that ""I HATED IT""  I did not hate the movie, I just hoped that it would be more comic relief entertainment because up to the movie release date Adam had always made me laugh out loud.",1216425600,10,1647,4.0588235294117645

You won't hear me comparing this movie to The Man Show like a lot of half baked movie fans because it is not The Man Show and it shouldn't carry an R rating.  The MPAA really effed up on that one.  This is a sweet love story about a down and out contractor who gets a second round in the ring of life.  Along the way he meets a girl, falls in love and shows off his left hook.  His real life carpenter Ozzie is hilarious as Carolla's best friend, Ozzie.

3139891,5,B00151QYFS,"Adam Carolla's first effort as a filmmaker is at some point going to make him into a bonafide movie star.  Carolla has that rare natural talent to be entertaining and spontaneously creative seemingly without effort.  This movie does not have the look and feel of the typical independent movie.  It has the look of a lot of studio polish; the acting and casting is spot on and the plot and story telling are first rate.  It's a good story, well told - the essence of good writing with a proper beginning, middle, and ending.

It's amazing that all the elements came together in his first effort.  It's much like a first novel when you are surprised it turns outs to be good.  I'm looking forward to Carolla's next film.  He's playing himself here and so is playing to his strength.  A wise move.  Whatever script he gets next time needs to accommodate Carolla's ability to come up with clever banter as he does daily in his morning radio show.

It would be neat if he got cast as a bad guy in a straight action or drama film just to see if he could act as someone other than himself.  With his talent, I think it's a sure thing.  It's probably an even surer bet that his next film will be a comedy and even better than this one.  We're looking at a franchise actor in Adam Carolla.  His star is about to rise even higher.  Talent like this is appreciated because it is so rare.

The Hammer is a sure bet.  The ""R"" rating is one of those quirks of the MPAA system.  Any movie that contains the ""F"" word gets the ""R"" rating automatically.  That word is uttered once and in a very humorous context.  This isn't an offensive film by any reasonable standard.  It's a good film and you probably haven't seen any good movies lately.",1215820800,6,1724,4.338557993730408

3139895,4,B00151QYFS,"I have been aware of this movie because of a daily morning self promotion by Adam Carolla on his morning radio show. Adam has always been a favorite of mine ever since his wise cracking co-hosting time on Lovelines TV show in the early 90's.

His morning radio show has been a mix of satire, intelligent conversation (specially with the absence of bully co-host Bonaducci who is likable but a better fit elsewhere)...and Teresa an equally intelligent, funny cohost. Being a fan, I wanted Adam to succeed with this movie...so... I rented this title on Netflix.

I found the movie interesting. Adam is an unlikely leading man, his face tends to exhibit one emotion, one with a permanent smirk. The movie suffered from an 'inexpensive' production which gave a feel of an after-school special, made for tv movie. The lighting seemed unnatural on many occasions, some acting less fluid, fight scenes leaving one wanting more. However, both the story and the script, exhibited the satire, smart wisecracking humor, and an honesty in this unlikely romantic comedy.

 A better production would have definitely elevated the feel of this movie but the story won me over. After seeing it I would be inclined to buy a copy...or copy it. Great job Adam and cast ! Thumbs up !",1215734400,,1262,4.828703703703703

3139897,5,B00151QYFS,"I bought this DVD because I'm a longtime fan of Adam Carolla, but you don't have to be a fan to appreciate this absolutely priceless film. If you're expecting raunchy Man Show humor, you won't find it here. This is a sweet, inspiring, romantic comedy that equals The Wedding Singer for striking the perfect blend of quirky humor, likeable characters, and a fabulous feel-good ending.

The Hammer is a semi-autobiographical film about a middle-aged loser (Carolla's Jerry Ferro) who gets the chance to pursue his lifelong dream, a shot at the Olympic Boxing Team. The story is told beautifully with the help of a perfect cast of characters. Oswaldo Castillo, Carolla's real-life construction friend, is particularly likeable as Jerry's sidekick Ozzie. Castillo's Nicaraguan accent is so thick that he is often impossible to understand, which only makes the character more endearing. The uncredited cameo by Jane Lynch as the lesbian Jerry argues with at the hardware store is side splittingly funny.

Viewers from Southern California will no doubt appreciate some of the local humor and scenery, but you don't have to be from Los Angeles to enjoy Jerry's laugh out loud ""date"" at the LaBrea Tar Pits.

This film is rated R for ""Brief Language,"" which amounts to the use of the F word once or twice. Other than that, this film is as wholesome as it gets. There is no nudity, sexual situations, violence, or excessive profanity. I would have no problem allowing a 12-year-old to watch this.

The Hammer is a story of friendship, love, and pursuing your dreams. May this film find the success on the small screen that it missed in its limited run theatrical release.",1215561600,3,1662,4.925
3139898,3,B00151QYFS,"I saw this on a DVD Rental (from Blockbuster Online) and noticed that it was listed as ""Excusive Rental"" from them.  Well, I just checked on Netflix and it is available. What gives?  If something is called ""exclusive"" what does that mean?  Sorry, 1 dropped star for this.  I hate Exclusive marketing, with a passion!!!!  I am a big videogamer, and the videogame companies love to use BS Exclusive offers, only to offer them on competing systems just months later, often.  I'm sick of this!

Sorry Adam, 1 dropped star for this (I would have given it 4 stars, without this faux pau.)

I watched this with great interest.  I am a HUGE Adam Carolla fan. I listen to his podcasts religiously.  So my expectations were very high!  I have to say, I was not disappointed.  This was a very funny movie.  I would recommend it to anyone, even if you rent from Netflix, because they rent it there too.

I have to agree about with Adam being upset about this film getting an R Rating. I think I heard one F bomb, and about two P Bombs, but the problem was they came in the first 10 minutes of the film, so that may be the reason why they censors called it R.  It was definitly a PG-13 in my book.  Something to think about next time though.  Spread out the bad words.

The film was also clearly low budget, but that didn't detract from the film's greatness.  Good job!

It's not all golden though, it was a somewhat low budget film and some times that shows through, mainly through the fight music. However, the rants of Adam Carolla make up for it. This movie had 2 F words (and I have only noticed one of them, I was told that it has 2)  and no other inappropriate elements, yet, it has a R rating.

3139904,4,B00151QYFS,"Carolla, much like Howard Stern in ""Private Parts,"" surprises us with a tender, funny movie that is 3-dimensional without selling out Adam's always-present dark side.
Unlike Stern, Carolla relies on story more than caricature and boobies.  This movie may not be believable in the larger sense, but more importantly it is believable minute by minute.  Like ""Rocky,"" ""The Bad News Bears"" or nurse porn, the movie makes you WANT to believe.
I paid ""The Hammer"" the ultimate compliment- I bought instead of duping it.  We need to support good product, and whether you like ""The Man Show"" or not (it's my least favorite of Carolla's efforts) you will like this movie.
Heather Juergensen is a great, believable pick as the love interest.  She is beautiful the way real women are beautiful- from the inside out.  So many female stars are smoking hot and nothing more.  Unless they're going to get naked, it's boring.  Another part of Carolla's evident maturity is the film's pace.  He also avoids the dogtired formula of the sophomoric schlubs and the hotties who either bust their balls or have a thing for fat losers in need of a shave.  Carolla's characters earn our trust and our empathy.  He does a little ""Annie Hall"" walk-and-zing dating at the LaBrea tarpits; he gives a nod to ""Rounders"" with Jerry's dream-raping girlfriend, and his relationship with his rival light-heavyweight is textured and three-dimensional, like a high-end molded plastic vagina.  Lastly, Ozzie Castillo is a delight.  The Somozista bastards couldn't destroy his great heart.
It's not a perfect film, but it may be a perfect first film.  I'd rank it (genre differences notwithstanding) just below ""Shakes the Clown"" and ""Swingers.""  Of course, both of those films were largely carried by supporting cast members- here Adam carries the movie on his own.
The other performances are fine, it's just that there's no Vince Vaughan-type of foil.
In terms of ""Why didn't they...?"" that's a cheap move made by people who talk about movies but never make them.  The only thing I did that about as I watched was about Adam's arms.  Having some real guns wouldn't have (in my opinion) distanced us from the character who swings a hammer for living, teaches boxing, and has a deadly left.  It's like he went to Steven Segal's action movie training camp.  Now, whenever I hear a fight bell ring a get a craving for KFC....",1215129600,,2385,4.890547263681592

It's easy to put yourself behind Jerry's corner and feel like you actually have a stake in his success and happiness.  After watching the DVD, I was baffled as to why it was rated R for ""brief language"".  The MPAA is a joke though, so what are you gonna do?

The humor is clever and smart and a nice change of pace from recent big budget comedies that rely on stoner/male anatomy humor and gross out gags for easy laughs.  Also, the love story is sweet and convincing as Adam and Heather Juergensen have great on-screen chemistry.

The DVD extras are plentiful and worth checking out.  The commentary provided by Adam and writer Kevin Hench is very entertaining, and the deleted scenes will leave you scratching your head as to why they were cut, particularly the deleted La Brea Tar Pits scene which I thought was hilarious.  The conversation with Ozzie and Adam is also great as Ozzie talks about his journey from being an EMT in Nicaragua to swinging a hammer with Adam in the San Fernando Valley.

Rather than manufacturing a bullet proof flight suite to defeat an unknown enemy, don't get me wrong, Iron Man is very good. This movie reminds me of a book by Charles Mingus: 'Beneath The Underdog'.

This is a great, great movie and should be an indictment on the MPAA because there's no way it deserves its R rating.  There's one F bomb and that's the end of its edginess.  It just feels like Hollywood wanted to knock this movie out, but it really didn't.  I love it, my friends love it, and my Carolla hating wife tolerated it.

3139936,5,B00151QYFS,"Adam Carolla commented that this movie was about an 8.5, but it had an extra likability and charm to it that other, equally satisfying movies on a technical level, do not have.  That statement defines as well as possible the special affection that most viewers walk away from this film with.  While an 8.5 is rare to find in theaters this day - or decade, there is something that connects with you when watching this film.  Maybe it's due to the universal themes it tells in its story and the fact that it doesn't confine itself to one genre, or any tired production cliches.
In the tale of this main character's life, there are great laughs, tumultuous challenges, determinism, and humanity.  It forgoes the mainstream movie model mold, to have the courage to flow between varying moods to best express these emotions and themes.  One scene may have no laughs, while exploring romance or drama instead.  Each aspect of this story is singularly richer due to that respect of the viewer's intelligence, while working in harmony when the time is right to create a wonderful and rare tapestry of composition, touching on many themes and emotions at once.
This film is composed with that fresh independence and it also looks the part.  Far from a negative point, certain scenes clearly lack the Hollywood polish and relentlessly overproduced timing.  There is a spirit of good friends, who happen to know what good comedy and good art is, getting together with their free time to put it on film - while done professionally and in skillful craft, it is not drowning in its own diluted stylism.
As I said, this film is not one genre more than the other; it's the life of a man who is middle aged and ready to take a chance, who luckily has a great sense of humor along the ride.  In fact, I would place Adam Carolla's character in the same league as Woody Allen and Larry David in that incredibly difficult role of the self-depricating, worldly complainer, whom is still charming and never loses your affection.  Beyond those legendary entertainers often portrayed roles, Carolla adds even more dimensions in his character, in the form of a man who knows when to be serious or romantic, in addition to that inviting wit and humor.
The Hammer is a movie that doesn't come along often.  It may be about an 8.5 on paper, but there is an unbelievably fresh vitality and meaning that comes through above all else and earns your affection; also earning it a near perfect rating, due to it's universal draw and long-unseen unique delivery.  It connects on a level that is reserved for our most beloved classic films.  For that, it is an excellent film with a story you may be familiar with, but delivered with a passion and brilliant humanity the likes of which I've never seen, nor expect to again any time soon.

Went to San Diego opening weekend to see a movie starring the Aceman, Adam Carollla. Wait, only two 'L's in Carolla.

Delete! Delete.

My two regrets about the movie are that I only saw it once, and that my hero Tom Brady isn't in it. As it is, it is only the funniest, wittiest, and best movie of the year, be it independent or studio-driven. If you doubled down and added some Brady, it is the perfect film, bar none.

Don't make the same mistake I did, online movie review readers. Buy two copies of the DVD so you can see it twice. It is that funny. Then send one copy each to the Aceman and Tom Brady, asking that they sign and return. When you don't get either copy back, buy another copy for future enjoyment.

A great Romantic Comedy, perfect for dates and couples.  No matter who you are you will find something to enjoy in this movie.

Also don't fear the R rating.  It has 2 F Bombs that are in context and not vulgar.  There is no violence other than some boxing.  No sex, nudity or suggestive conversation.  No gross out humor or anything offensive for that matter.  unless you are super uptight you won't find anything in here that you would feel uncomfortable showing your 10 year old.

We live in a day and age where crappy movies make millions (good luck chuck?) and a great movie like the Hammer could not find the founding to be put into more than twenty theaters.  This is a great movie and Adam Corolla holds his own in this movie.

The general story is one most people can relate to, a middle aged guy whose life has lead him to one dead end after another.  One day he gets a second change to make something of himself in the boxing ring and decides to take a chance one more time.  Finding rivalry, friendship and a new love this movie has everything a person could want in a GOOD comedy.
It stars Adam Corolla and his real life friend Ozzy in a great movie to watch on a Saturday night.  A movie for ALL AGES even thought it does have a R rating it is more a PG that a R movie.  Most people recognize the Ace Man from The Man Show or Love Line but this movie is a polar opposite romantic comedy about one man trying to do one last thing with his life.

Make no mistake with The Hammer, it wasn't simply ""better than expected"", it is genuinely a great movie, very funny, and very fun to watch.

It's the perfect movie to buy on DVD, because many people haven't seen or heard of it, so when you've got people over at the house looking at your DVD collection, The Hammer is one you're going to convince them to watch every time.",1208908800,62,647,4.134920634920635
3373839,5,B00151QYFS,"Carolla and Juergensen have a hit here!  The Hammer, loosely based on Adam Carolla's real life as a simple carpenter -- before the his top-rated morning radio show, before his turning-point friendship with now Tonight Show host Jimmy Kimmel, before The Man Show -- is an authentic view into the dreams, doubts and struggles of an average guy trying to make a better life for himself in the tough world of boxing without losing his ethics. Carolla's trademark wit will keep you laughing through the entire movie; the boxing scenes provide enough action for guys; Juergensen as the smart love interest hits just the right note; the entire film simply amuses, delights and charms. Buy This Classic Movie! You will love it regardless of whether you know who Carolla is. I just saw this movie Friday and can't stop smiling and recommending it. Mainstream reviews are uniformly positive; Ebert & gave it 2 thumbs way up!",1206403200,58,914,4.858974358974359

3373846,5,B00151QYFS,"It's not a big-budget film, but it's got a lot to offer content-wise. Kinda-sorta it's romantic comedy, but Carolla's artistic style seems to emphasize the process of achievement as an underdog, such that the ""coming out a winner"" is the ""getting the girl"" rather than actual winning the heart of a woman. This style element didn't harm my ability to enjoy the film since the romance is symbolic more than a driver of plot. Carolla is rightly celebrated for his rags-to-riches fame in his personal life, so it suits him to make stories surrounding the kinds of trials that have carried him to the success everyone wants. As a native of the area where this film is shot, I appreciated the Hollywood/Glendale locations. It established an important feel to the film, and cements Carolla's brand. The Oswoldo character is of tremendous value comedically, and functions not unlike Pedro in Napoleon Dynamite. However, his overly thick accent may frustrate some viewers. It's intentional, of course, to have Oswoldo barely able to communicate in English &agrave; la Manuel in Fawlty Towers. Since there was likely no budget for dialogue replacement, the ideal level of unintelligibility may not have been achieved. Watch Road Hard if you enjoyed this. Familiar themes for Carolla fans and just the thing to watch on a plane.",1504569600,,1318,5.0228310502283104

3373849,5,B00151QYFS,"I'm an Adam Carolla fanatic. I've been following his work since the late 90's when he was doing Lovelines and the Man Show. I'm perpetually impressed with his material and output. His recent documentaries are amazing! While I didn't love his second movie, ""Road Hard"" as much, this movie was a surprise charmer.

It's got a few bumps in the road but overall it's a solid, feel-good movie with great writing and Mr. Carolla's signature acerbic wit and style. It's worth the watch for the Jane Lynch scene alone. The romantic elements move the story forward in a heart-felt way without making you want to puke in your mouth.

Overall, if you are an Adam Carolla fan, you're in for a treat. I would recommend this to anyone in the mood for something charming, funny and a little edgy.",1499990400,,781,4.611510791366906

That being said, his subtle humor and body language may give you a false impression as to his true ""wheel spinning"" brain. He see's the world in a very pragmatic way and in so doing he derives his creative juices in a way that the average ""Joe"" may not quite get! That being said, look for the little things in the human interaction that most people don't see or care to see. Then you may experience the genius of his film art.",1427328000,,486,4.236559139784946

3373962,2,B00151QYFS,"I love Adam but geez he sure ain't an actor. What's funny is he would be the first one to mock guys for being surrounded by ""yes men"" who just won't tell you that you don't come off genuine on screen (at all) yet he is clearly surrounded by them. The movie did have some good jokes and I just love Adams pov but mercy this movie just didn't work for me and it had everything to do with adams acting. He just released Road Hard and is complaining pretty heavily about getting bad reviews and I think it's laughable that he just refuses to believe that it's possible he might not be what he thinks he is onscreen. Don't even get me started with the final scene of the Hammer. Yuck....I think I could do more with my iPhone and a couple buddies. Adam would tear me a new one if he read this im sure but he'd prob take the high road and say I'm not worth getting upset over and do or say anything to give the impression he doesn't care about little people like me (like he always does) but there are some of us out here who can see through the facade and know that your every moment is spent trying to justify yourself in the eyes of the one who you think matter. Hahahaha, we all matter Adam, even little ole me. Little ole going nowhere pos me. I love it, at least I've given him what he wants. a preconceived opinion of him which I based this review on.....hahaha.....now he can write me off because the movie wasn't what I said it was, I just have some vendetta against him.

If you have no idea who Adam Carolla is, you'll likely still enjoy the movie.  It has quality writing and believable performances from the actors. This movie is semi autobiographic for Carolla.  He was a carpenter, boxer, comedian and lover ::SNIFF:: (Carolla fans will get what the sniff means).  Adam's real life friend Ozzie is a great addition to the movie.  He has no acting experience but some how plays a great part, he barely speaks English in real life so this seems even more impressive.  I especially enjoyed the jump rope scene where Carolla is showing off to his love interest while wearing headphones.

Great soundtrack too!",1398729600,,315,5.117647058823529
3374067,5,B00151QYFS,"I love everything Carolla does. Books, Podcasts, etc. I instantly loved the movie. Forced my parents to watch it and they laughed to the point of tears throughout the film.

I've followed his career as he got his own radio shows and a couple of TV series (Crank Yankers and The Man Show).  This movie loosely follows his life story up until the point where his career took off.  It is well written and funny throughout.

The Hammer shows his sincere side and is just good film making.  It's not pretentious, overblown, sexist or silly.  The story and setting are heart warming realistic regular guy places and situations, and the moral of the story is that heart and hard work are never wasted.  See this movie.  There are no car chases, silly jokes or dead end plot lines.  Get away from the billion dollar computer generated blockbusters for an hour and a half and see a real movie with some good comedy, real life drama and actual human beings being human beings.  You won't be disappointed.  This is good film making.",1396915200,,785,4.63768115942029

The experiences in this movie are based off of Adam's real life construction jobs in the 90's. Oswaldo, one of the characters in the movie, is played by Adam's buddy that he met on the construction site.

The story is one of the best sports underdog films to ever come out. Can't write enough positives about this movie. Do yourself a favor, no matter what your opinion on the man show, or Carolla's other works, RENT THIS MOVIE. It's certified 'fresh' on rotten tomatoes, so you know it's good.",1380844800,,662,4.610169491525424

3374127,4,B00151QYFS,Good movie - very funny dialog. Adam Carolla's monotone delivery of sarcasm is top shelf. I hope he continues to produce films developed around his Pulp Fiction meets Jerry Seinfeld style of humor. There's a great song in the film i've been trying to track down but no luck yet. Please reply if you know know the songs or where I can find a list.,1379894400,,346,4.338461538461538
3374128,5,B00151QYFS,"Carolla is a funny man. This film is a true representation of the working mans hardships. Done well on a small budget, Ozzie is hillarious especially if you've worked in the trades. Check out the Adam carolla podcast for more of the funny man. He has another movie with a bit more of a budget coming soon called Road Hard.",1379635200,,322,4.383333333333334
3374129,5,B00151QYFS,"I've been listening to his podcast for over a year and was finally able to get a hold of this DVD.  This is a great small movie and proves, once again, that a good film is good because of the story it tells not the CGI, FX, or celebrity of the cast.  Mr. Carolla takes the themes of his life (if you know his other work) and creates a compelling story about a loser who becomes a success. The film works because while the message of the movie is serious, Carolla tells his story with great humanity and humor. There is a short jump roping scene that is simply one of funniest 60 seconds ever captured on film. The two main characters are likable and believable.  The supporting characters are, to some extent, caricatures.  But, they serve the purpose of moving the story forward.  Oswaldo Castillo is hilarious and a brilliant piece of casting by Mr. Carolla.",1379116800,,860,4.452229299363057

It's not an awful movie but it was predictable, and didn't really introduce any new ideas to the comedy genre.  I wouldn't purchase the movie or pay more than 3.99 for the rental.

I always thought Carolla was a bit of a stiff on the ""Man Show"", the I saw ""The Adam Carolla Project"" and I understand a little more that he is just a guy, he was not professionally trained but rather came up through rough carpentry and working his ass off.  I never knew he boxed until I saw this show.  He has a lot of great stuff in here, my only criticism is that he seems to try to get all his material in this one movie.  There is some bad language but otherwise I would feel perfectly comfortable watching this with my kids.  Carolla doesn't rely on over the top raunch and language to be funny but wit and true to life situations.  My wife also really loved this movie.",1363564800,,728,4.055944055944056

3374203,5,B00151QYFS,"I really wasn't that surprised that The Hammer turned out as good as it did. I know some of the criticism that's been laid out is that Carolla just plays himself. I'm not gonna disagree with that fact on the whole. He's basically taken a number of facts and times from his personal life and experiences to build this character. That doesn't make the story any less interesting or fun. A lot of writers do that so the critique is essentially pointless .

I love the story of a man who at one point in his younger years was an up and coming amateur boxer with tons of talent. Could have been great if not for injuries and other curve balls life threw at him. It's a very amusing and heart warming tale to see him get back into the higher end of enjoying life and realizing some dreams of a better existence. All the while with a backstabbing manager and woman troubles on the side. I think Carolla really put together a very solid story that's very entertaining. No there aren't a ton of out loud riotous laughs, mostly some really good chuckles and a few laugh out loud moments. Whoever declared it law though that comedy couldn't be fulfilling while being more subtle and subdued? It's a genuine tale inspired by a lot of his experiences so the comedies in the reality. Watch it and decide for yourself. You might just really enjoy it.",1358553600,,1335,4.426829268292683

Go to a sporting event in person and you'll hear worse the entire time. F-bombs removed, this movie could easily be PG. The story is feel good and the jokes are nonstop.

I think the movie is pretty sincere, and some parts are a bit ham-fisted, but not out of place.

I have one particular gripe, and that is near the end of the movie.  The fight scene would have been much more compelling and enjoyable if we didn't have the ringside announcer spoon feeding us the action on the screen complete with editorial commentary to tell us what he thinks the fighters must be feeling at this moment.  It felt very unnatural and distracting.  I think it would have meant more if we were allowed to experience the scene and draw our own conclusions.  I really wish that scene would have been reworked to cut out the chatter and speculation.

Otherwise, a fine movie, well worth seeing if you are a Carolla fan.",1356393600,,844,4.371794871794871

Carolla writes, stars and  helped produce this feature and it will impress you.

The story's excellent and, perhaps surprisingly, Adam's performance is top-notch. Indeed, the comedian proves he has the acting chops to carry a full-length feature film.

I know that it sounds generic, but if you like Adam Carolla, you will like The Hammer. It doesn't strive for more than it can offer, and It was really interesting getting to see the things that Adam often talks about in his podcast play out in real-life situations.

He is building his Pirate Ship thru a ground breaking podcast empire, funny autobiographical books and live shows. He has multiple talents but his secret is the entrepreneurial gene his classmates at NHH lacked. I'm going to Seattle from Oregon to see him with Dennis Prager in Dec.  I brought some of my initial skepticism to this movie a couple years ago but it won me over with how very good it is. The writing is solid with unexpected twists which is a real feat when trying yet another boxing film. Acting is natural. In this case that means good. It obviously drawns from incidents in Adam's life and that adds to the interest if you are a fan. Recently I watched it for a second time and my positive impressions were confirmed. Ozzie, one of Adam's real life pals, is great by the way.  The film is enjoyable, funny, touching at times. In other words its a really good movie.",1353715200,,1026,4.54054054054054

The breakout scene-stealer of the movie is, of course Oswaldo ""Ozzy"" Castillo. Somehow, Castillo manages to elevate Carolla's star power to new heights.

The story soars, but is grounded in an abundance of Adam's signature sarcasm and dry humor. We see ourselves in Adam's plight as he longs for a shot at glory.

Carolla does exactly that writing about a down on his luck carpenter and evening fitness boxing instructor who comes into his own later in life. Lack of self esteem seems to have kept him check till spotted by a local trainer noticing his ""heavy left""...the hammer. Out of work and a girl friend he finds renewed inspiration in a student and a hope at making the Olympic team. Its not high art but the story is sweet and pacing is kept up with Carolla's jokes and lively patter. He is accompanied by a proud Nicaraguan named Ozzie...who, is mostly indecipherable throughout the film but steals scenes left and right. Its a sharp contrast that works Carolla's wit.

After watching The Hammer, I have to say that it's pretty good! I mean he's no Daniel Day-Lewis, but it was better than 90% of movies on cable or premium channels.

The story was compelling, I empathized with the characters and bought into the story almost immediately. Adam's acting could have been a little better, sometimes he looked lazy in the ring and in the romantic scenes. Ozzie should be in more movies. And, it was very funny.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it!

However, get this movie on DVD. It's like $6 on DVD, and $10 to buy or $4 to rent on Amazon Instant Video. I opted for the instant option this Labor Day and was disappointed not to have the Extra Features from the DVD.",1346716800,,924,4.621951219512195

With an underlying theme that talks close to home about the reality of the working world that made Adam the man he is, this movie shares a great tale of an unknown up and comer with the dream to box and the talent to do it.

Adam has built his own brand through his radio and podcast work and he is, without a doubt, the go to broadcast for understanding how and what living in LA is all about. Making the film The Hammer is an achievement that spawns from exactly what he discusses often on his show. Take an idea, not just any but a good idea, put all you've got into it and if you truly have the talent to compete - you too can create something that has value and worth.

If you're looking for a film that inspires, makes you laugh and will find it's way into your DVD player over and over, this is the one.

The choice of music was lousy, the romance was ""normal"" ""sane"", ""nice"" but not hot.  There were some good parts of the movie.  Ozzy was actually very funny and endearing, some of the dialogue was good, the directing was okay, it looked good for a film done on a shoestring budget,  It had a lot of heart.

Then Loveline on MTV was canceled and stopped being carried on the radio in my area. I never heard his morning show but I've found thousands of mp3s of old Loveline shows which I listen to regularly and I enjoy his podcast and have listened to it since it started. I say all of that because from that I've grown to know and like Adam. Unfortunately, while he's very funny in his rants, he's also repetitive and he can't act to save his life. If you know and like Carolla's rants, this movie is basically just a collection of some of his standard rants with a movie built around them. The rants themselves include several of his classics and are good but they feel like they've been shoehorned into the story (because they have). I should also say that while I've listened to Adam for years, I've stopped listening to his podcast simply because he is so repetitive. This movie is more of the same from Adam Carolla. Nothing really new or exciting. If you know and enjoy Adam then you'll enjoy the movie well enough, maybe even love it if you're a huge Carolla fan.

The performances were all very good and the plot is much more realistic than most underdog sports films. The movie is well made with equal parts humor and heart.

I still think it's funny how Adam just employs his friends to be in all of his stuff, considering none of them are actors or comedians.

The movie is semi-autobiographical in a way, since Adam's character is a construction worker and boxing instructor while living in the San Fernando Valley, much like Adam's life was as a young adult.

3374282,5,B00151QYFS,"I don't know why it took me so long to buy this video. I was a devoted fan of Adam Carolla on LA's KLSX right up to day the station canned its talk format and descended into the depths of mumble music. Carolla demonstrated rapier brilliance from day he showed up on KRLA as Mr. Birchum, the hilarious gravel voiced shop teacher that you would never want your kid to spend an hour with. From there to Love Line, bouts with TV's Man Show, and finally to the morning radio slot vacated by the vastly self-over-rated Howard Stern. Although he takes wicked pleasure in detailing his misspent youth--how do you flunk out of junior college really?--Carolla has impeccable creds to make a movie about a struggling carpenter taking one last shot at boxing glory. Carolla has carpentered and he has boxed, both for real. ""Hammer"" is an inspired concept that captures both pursuits in a single word.

Since taking possession of the DVD, I've watched it with various groups of people. Everyone without exception has enjoyed it. You don't need to love or even approve of boxing to get caught up in the story, which has an ending that is fitting but not predictable, moving but not gooey. Carolla has gone on record that he never expects the Hammer to make a dime of profit. I'm happy to have contributed a few bucks toward reducing the deficit.

3374301,3,B00151QYFS,"The main problem with The Hammer is that it is so thoroughly mediocre.  It's purportedly a comedy, but it's not very funny.  Most of the humor is supposed to come from Adam Carolla's signature rants that have been awkwardly shoe-horned into the script, but it rarely works.  Carolla, while a legitimately funny media personality, is also a very, very bad actor, and he never comes off as anything other than stilted and ineffective in the leading role.  The plot is overly contrived, and the supposedly ""witty"" dialogue is consistently ho-hum.  The film does work on the level of being a relationship movie, but here again, while it's not terrible, it also can't be construed as good.

We were woken up early by the daughter at 3am.  She was up for the day, so I snuck one by the goalie, and talked the lady into finally seeing the movie.  She might have liked the movie more than I did, and she hated Carolla.  She was won over by it, and even was telling her friends to see the movie.

The story is simple Carolla plays a regular guy who doesn't apply himself and hasn't had much success financially or emotionally.

The film works because Carolla eases up on his usual attics and plays a very likable guy and the relationship between him and Juergensen is realistic.

Some will dismiss Adam Carolla as a racist and thereby assuming everything he did was racist.

The good news is, he certainly didn't disappoint. It was a well-written and believable story filled with interesting characters and clever plot lines. Adam's ad-libbing was even better than expected and his love interest, played by Heather Jeurgensen, is cute, funny and poignant in all the right places.

- Coach Bell: ""So you still have your amateur status?""
- Ferro: ""Not as a carpenter.""

Who would've thunk it, that Adam Carolla could make a sweet little film like THE HAMMER? Carolla's a pretty funny guy, quick-witted and self-deprecating, so that the movie has its share of funny is a gimme - but, hey, that it would also have heart? I wasn't expecting that. Adam Carolla plays the down-and-out Jerry Ferro, an ex-Golden Gloves boxer and now a struggling unlicensed carpenter - although he holds evening boxing classes at the local gym. Jerry's 40th birthday drops like the hammer of doom, the same day landing him a scuffle with his boss which then loses him his construction gig and his fed-up girlfriend. But he gets a second shot at his boxing dream when he's invited to the Olympic boxing tryouts. Surprisingly, Jerry also gets a second shot at romance. All his life, Jerry has found ways to eff up his life. How's he gonna mess this one up?

THE HAMMER - Jerry Ferro's boxing nickname, not because he's a handyman but because of the pop in his left hand - is one of those innocuous-looking films you accidentally pause on while you're flipping thru channels but then end up sticking around for until the closing credits. Even though Carolla's character is an unmitigated slacker, this is a film which espouses that blue collar perspective. Even if the story itself is predictable, Carolla's low key yet spot-on performance drives the thing. I've never perceived him as the endearing sort, but as world-weary loser Jerry Ferro, Carolla right away pulls you into his corner. Me, I very quickly ended up caring what happens to Jerry Ferro. THE HAMMER is touted as a comedic underdog sports flick, but, thanks to Carolla and Heather Juergensen's chemistry, it's also a surprisingly touching romantic movie.

Carolla and the good-natured Oswaldo Castillo have been long time friends in real life and they do good things together in the film. The scenes with Jerry Ferro and his loyal best bud Ozzy (Castillo) are terrific and very funny and surprisingly heartfelt (and at this point I should probably stop using the word ""surprisingly""). THE HAMMER is very funny, with much of the humor coming from Carolla's riffs and drily delivered one-liners. However, some of the situational comedy are gold, such as when the Hammer is already wrapped and gloved up but then needing to use the bathroom or the scene with the rousing ""Eye of the Tiger"" anthem playing on as Ferro keeps on hitting his alarm clock's snooze button. And word to the wise if you're a fan of the La Brea Tar Pits, Ferro relentlessly bags on that place on his day date with the public defender cutie (""The La Brea Tar Pits? Wow, this date's officially been downgraded to a field trip."").

Carolla used to be a carpenter and a boxing instructor so both fields are ably represented here. I must say that Adam Carolla is convincing as a has-been, aging boxer. And Jerry Ferro seems to be a cat who, even when immersed in the boxing world, still can't help but wax knowledgeable on all things home improvement-y. This even lands him in trouble with a power puncher named Malice Blake (real life pugilist Jeff Lacy who, by the way, used to be good but now needs to hang it up). Ferro's ""toggle bolts"" rant lands him in the squared circle with Malice, in which Ferro takes his lumps but then unleashes a left hook (or maybe it was a left cross) and knocks down Malice. As a longtime boxing fan, this scene is ironic to me because Jeff Lacy's nickname is ""Left Hook."" Anyway, it's his one punch pummelling of Malice which ushers Ferro back to the world of competitive boxing. I like that this film is riddled with plenty of feel-good underdog moments like that.

His ex-partner Jimmy Kimmel may have the higher profile, but Adam Carolla's no slouch in the wiseacre department. I've watched him regularly on the raunchy Man Show and listened to his popular radio show for a long while now (although, sadly, his radio show's gone kaput). Carolla's been on various television shows, but THE HAMMER is his first lead role on the big screen and he makes the most of it. If you want to see a funny movie that's more than just a funny movie, if you want to see another side of Adam Carolla - a more introspective side - and if you want to see a bit (not a lot, just a bit) of behind-the-scenes stuff in the world of the sweet science, then give THE HAMMER a try. I guarantee you'll stay the full round.",1242000000,2,4548,4.602959309494452

First the movie is low budget, but comes across as well produced independent.  The movie appears to be shot on location at several areas and was well done.  The acting was somewhat cheesey but Carolla is not a movie star and held his own.

The plot has been mentioned in every review and nothing to add.  The movie is about a down and out carpenter who gets a chance to realize his dreams and change his life around.  It is a feel good movie and worth your time and money.  The guests were telling the truth the Hammer is a good movie, lets hope Mr. Carolla has an opportunity to do another movie.",1234396800,,862,4.144578313253012

3374326,5,B00151QYFS,"How often does a film come along where myself, a Carolla fan who's not offended by anyone/thing, my female friends not into sports, and my 81 year old mother who dislikes nudity, cussing, and violence, all come to love together? This is it. As Adam says, the R-rating was due to, I believe, one 'bad' word uttered once. Overall this was a truly original film, maybe not in terms of the storyline and procedure, but due to the fact it has universal appeal to everyone and can be serious, inspirational, and full of comedy, while never pandering to any emotion. I, being a Carolla fan know of his humor, but a lot of others may only have heard of him and think he is dirty, sexist, raunchy, etc... a la Howard Stern. But those of us who know his full gamut of thought, also a la Stern, know there is much more there. While many other films capture certain themes or emotions as well or better, The Hammer captures them all masterfully into a widely and wildly entertaining 90 minutes of near-perfect entertainment. And one step further, as one other reviewer noted, I bought a 'gift' copy for a friend, sent the jacket to Adam's radio show, and got a personally signed copy back in time for an Xmas gift. What a great surprise and due to it's limited theatrical release hopefully others can get a chance to experience a great entertainment joy in the aftermarket world of DVD.",1231459200,,1374,4.522088353413655

3374328,4,B00151QYFS,"This is a very likeable, root-for-the-underdog, feel-good movie that everyone can like.  One could mistakenly think that was a description of ""The Karate Kid,"" but it applies equally well to ""The Hammer.""

In fact, there are many parallels between ""Karate Kid"" and ""The Hammer.""  They both have underdog fighters as their protagonists, they both have boy-meets-girl love stories, they both have wisecracking older fighters mentoring a younger fighter, and they both culminate in fight tournament, feel-good climaxes.  And while neither movie is high art, they are both lighthearted, humor-filled romps that stand up to repeated viewings.

The protagonist, Jerry Ferro, is played by Adam Carolla, and is loosely based upon his own experiences as a carpenter/boxing instructor before he broke into the entertainment industry on ""Loveline"" and ""The Man Show.""  Imagine Karate Kid's Daniel-san becoming a 40-year old, sharing all his Miyagi-taught wisdom with a younger fighter, while simultaneously training for a comeback fight tournament, and you have a basic template for Ferro.

Thanks to his real life boxing background, Carolla brings a great sense of realism to the boxing, and especially the rope skipping scenes.  His dramatic skills aren't as impressive, though one could argue that Ferro is intentionally written to emulate Carolla's real life, semi-stiff affect.  If that was the intent, then I'd have to concede that Carolla's performance is spot-on perfect (since it wouldn't be an act at all).  In any case, half of Ferro's lines are Carolla-isms delivered in his real life comedian style, so this slightly weak link is generally not noticeable.

In ""The Karate Kid,"" the weakest link is probably the boy-girl love story.  ""The Hammer,"" on the other hand, has a pretty compelling love story thanks to great writing, and a strong performance by the love interest played by Heather Juergensen.  And it's really hard to not admire ""the candle scene"" (I won't make this a spoiler by saying any more than that).

That being said, the movie's greatest strength is its humor.  You rarely have to go more than a minute or two between laughs.  A movie that sends you on your way with a belly full of laughs, and a warm fuzzy feeling about underdogs catching a break is a can't-miss combo.  Like I said earlier, this is not high art, so I'm giving it 4-stars instead of 5.  But don't let that deter you from seeing this -- Karate Kid is also only 4-stars, and you sure wouldn't want to have missed that one, right?",1229731200,,2516,5.021686746987951

I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't waiting for the pyrotechnics, bare breasts or gratuitious use of the ""F"" word.

Heather Juergensen is a perfect romantic lead, charming and adorable, pretty, but thankfully not just Barbie doll eye-candy.  Adam is not an actor, but there are worse performers to spend an hour and a half with.  Adam's never terribly dynamic, but his wisecracks and his gift for carefully observed and well told complaints is without peer.

What really made the movie work was Adam's relationship with Ozzie.  One can tell they are friends off-screen just by the way they interacted throughout the film.

3374351,4,B00151QYFS,"I found out about this movie completely by accident, while searching Amazon for items related to Adam Carolla, of whom I am a big fan.  I knew nothing about this movie before seeing it, and to tell the truth my expectations were quite low.

The movie is, however, much better than I would have thought.  Fans of Adam Carolla will have little to complain about, as the movie features great doses of his characteristic black wit.  The script is also quite decent.

The movie is not without its problems, however.  It asks the viewer to take it seriously in areas where it really has no business doing so.

First of all, Adam Carolla is one of those people like Steve Martin or Conan O'Brien, who have been sarcastic wags in the public eye so effectively and for so long that by this point it's impossible to take them seriously in a formal dramatic role.  And that's the surprising part about this movie: by and large it is a straight movie, complete with a romantic interest and an uplifting ending.  I was fully expecting the movie to have some sort of bitter, misanthropic conclusion; what I was not expecting was that the movie in many respects would be so conventional and straightforward.  And when you have a guy like Adam Carolla who has spent so much of his professional career spouting off on subjects as unsavory as bodily fluids and nether regions, it's virtually impossible to let the movie work whatever effect it was aiming at.

The other area in which it is difficult to take the movie seriously is a core plot point: the fact that the aging Carolla is in fact a gifted boxer and invariably strikes down formidable foes is, well, a bit tough to swallow.  Once or twice would have been okay, but dozens and dozens in a row?  That was getting ridiculous, and the sight of it made it difficult to take the movie seriously in other areas.

So, in conclusion, not a great film but one certainly worth two hours of your time.  If you're a Carolla fan, however, it's worth watching twice just so you can get the full dollop of his wit.",1217721600,,2042,4.495934959349594

Everyone I know who watched the movie liked it. They all seemed to laugh more than I did, though, and I think I know why: I'm too big an Adam fan.  I listen to The Adam Carolla Show way more than is probably good for me, and since there was no advertising budget for this movie, there were a few months of ""Hammer"" bombardment where audio drops from the movie were played over and over until some of the jokes were ""F'ed out"" as Adam would say.

It's subtle, nuanced and self deprecating in a way that makes you want to root for the underdog. I've recommended this to all my friends because it's a a great little film that should have seen a wider theatrical release. If this is the kind of material that Adam has been looking to do his entire career I believe he's better suited for it. If you're thinking it's going to  be an outlandish comedy based on ""crank yankers"", ""the man show"" or ""drawn together"" you're going to be disappointed, this is a solid romantic comedy and the first performance from Adam that not only represents his true maturity level but honors his abilities as a dramatic and comedic actor at the same time.

3374367,2,B00151QYFS,"I must admit, I fell for the hype. I liked Adam on Loveline and The Man Show, but his morning radio show is pretty lame, unless you like meandering drivel. I only listen during Mark and Brian commercials(and if Kevin and Bean also are at commercial). I decided to give the movie a try after repeatedly hearing him pat himself on the back about how good it was and how it didn't get any bad reviews. Well, I was highly disappointed to say the least. If you like predictable movies and bad acting, you'll love this movie! The only redeeming quality(and thus a second star for my review) is the leading lady, played by Heather Juergensen. She is very charming, but unfortunately, couldn't save the movie on her own. Please don't waste your time/money on this film, if only to dissuade Adam from acting in the future! He was on Tim Conway Jr's radio show again last night, and said all of the reviews on Amazon were glowing- he must not have checked recently!",1217030400,4,955,4.494252873563219

For the months leading up to the DVD release, there was a long line of guests on his show and listeners who would call in and rave about how hillarious it was, so I was really expecting something great.  Also, Adam played quite a few clips from the movie on his radio show over the months before the DVD came out.  So by the time the DVD came out, I felt like I had already seen it.  Most of the jokes were observations that Adam has already ranted about on his show, and with all of the clips I'd heard, I didn't feel like there was a whole lot of new material for me.  I'm sure I would have liked it a lot more if I had never listened to Adam before as it all would have been new material for me.  With that said, it is a good movie, and there are some parts that will make you laugh out loud.  I think it is a great way for people to meet Adam for the first time, fall in love with his humor, and then be converted to his radio show.

All of us liked the movie and its hard to get us all to agree on anything.
It's 3 weeks later and I still remember some good scenes! It was very entertaining and insightful despite the negative connotations the former co-host of The Man Show might have on this movie. The Man Show was high brow humor about a low brow subject. With The Hammer, you get high brow comedy about a former boxer coming of age.

I'm puzzled as to why it was rated R, with only two uses of the f-bomb, no sexual content, and no graphic violence.

3374377,3,B00151QYFS,"I have been a fan of Adam Carolla since he sat alongside Dr. Drew on the radio show ""Love Line.""  I listened to him from the first day he was on Dr. Drew's show until he left to move on to bigger and better things for himself.  I even sat in the audience of his TV show ""The Man Show"" which I really enjoyed.  However, I have to say much to Adam's chagrin that he is a lousy actor.  He is too much of a stiff in front of the camera and always has been.  His acting in ""The Hammer"" is ""NO"" exception.

My guess has to be that the other people who left an overwhelming positive review here on Amazon for ""The Hammer"" must certainly be his pals in Hollywood.  The idea of Adam portraying a carpenter and a boxer is so ridiculous because if you know Adam you know that he used to work as a carpenter and met Jimmy Kimmel while giving him boxing lessons.  Suffice to say that there was no need to make an effort here where Adam had to research his character for the movie since he is essentially in a role as himself.

Adam, I really like your work in radio and I strongly believe that that is where you need to keep yourself.  You have a very quick wit and your salt of the earth comedy leaves me in stitches.  Sorry Adam, but this is my honest opinion and it pains me because I really wanted to like your movie.

I just bumped my rating up to three stars today because when I wrote this comment 5 years ago I did not realize that I was stating that ""I HATED IT""  I did not hate the movie, I just hoped that it would be more comic relief entertainment because up to the movie release date Adam had always made me laugh out loud.",1216425600,10,1647,4.0588235294117645

You won't hear me comparing this movie to The Man Show like a lot of half baked movie fans because it is not The Man Show and it shouldn't carry an R rating.  The MPAA really effed up on that one.  This is a sweet love story about a down and out contractor who gets a second round in the ring of life.  Along the way he meets a girl, falls in love and shows off his left hook.  His real life carpenter Ozzie is hilarious as Carolla's best friend, Ozzie.

3374388,5,B00151QYFS,"Adam Carolla's first effort as a filmmaker is at some point going to make him into a bonafide movie star.  Carolla has that rare natural talent to be entertaining and spontaneously creative seemingly without effort.  This movie does not have the look and feel of the typical independent movie.  It has the look of a lot of studio polish; the acting and casting is spot on and the plot and story telling are first rate.  It's a good story, well told - the essence of good writing with a proper beginning, middle, and ending.

It's amazing that all the elements came together in his first effort.  It's much like a first novel when you are surprised it turns outs to be good.  I'm looking forward to Carolla's next film.  He's playing himself here and so is playing to his strength.  A wise move.  Whatever script he gets next time needs to accommodate Carolla's ability to come up with clever banter as he does daily in his morning radio show.

It would be neat if he got cast as a bad guy in a straight action or drama film just to see if he could act as someone other than himself.  With his talent, I think it's a sure thing.  It's probably an even surer bet that his next film will be a comedy and even better than this one.  We're looking at a franchise actor in Adam Carolla.  His star is about to rise even higher.  Talent like this is appreciated because it is so rare.

The Hammer is a sure bet.  The ""R"" rating is one of those quirks of the MPAA system.  Any movie that contains the ""F"" word gets the ""R"" rating automatically.  That word is uttered once and in a very humorous context.  This isn't an offensive film by any reasonable standard.  It's a good film and you probably haven't seen any good movies lately.",1215820800,6,1724,4.338557993730408

3374392,4,B00151QYFS,"I have been aware of this movie because of a daily morning self promotion by Adam Carolla on his morning radio show. Adam has always been a favorite of mine ever since his wise cracking co-hosting time on Lovelines TV show in the early 90's.

His morning radio show has been a mix of satire, intelligent conversation (specially with the absence of bully co-host Bonaducci who is likable but a better fit elsewhere)...and Teresa an equally intelligent, funny cohost. Being a fan, I wanted Adam to succeed with this movie...so... I rented this title on Netflix.

I found the movie interesting. Adam is an unlikely leading man, his face tends to exhibit one emotion, one with a permanent smirk. The movie suffered from an 'inexpensive' production which gave a feel of an after-school special, made for tv movie. The lighting seemed unnatural on many occasions, some acting less fluid, fight scenes leaving one wanting more. However, both the story and the script, exhibited the satire, smart wisecracking humor, and an honesty in this unlikely romantic comedy.

 A better production would have definitely elevated the feel of this movie but the story won me over. After seeing it I would be inclined to buy a copy...or copy it. Great job Adam and cast ! Thumbs up !",1215734400,,1262,4.828703703703703

3374394,5,B00151QYFS,"I bought this DVD because I'm a longtime fan of Adam Carolla, but you don't have to be a fan to appreciate this absolutely priceless film. If you're expecting raunchy Man Show humor, you won't find it here. This is a sweet, inspiring, romantic comedy that equals The Wedding Singer for striking the perfect blend of quirky humor, likeable characters, and a fabulous feel-good ending.

The Hammer is a semi-autobiographical film about a middle-aged loser (Carolla's Jerry Ferro) who gets the chance to pursue his lifelong dream, a shot at the Olympic Boxing Team. The story is told beautifully with the help of a perfect cast of characters. Oswaldo Castillo, Carolla's real-life construction friend, is particularly likeable as Jerry's sidekick Ozzie. Castillo's Nicaraguan accent is so thick that he is often impossible to understand, which only makes the character more endearing. The uncredited cameo by Jane Lynch as the lesbian Jerry argues with at the hardware store is side splittingly funny.

Viewers from Southern California will no doubt appreciate some of the local humor and scenery, but you don't have to be from Los Angeles to enjoy Jerry's laugh out loud ""date"" at the LaBrea Tar Pits.

This film is rated R for ""Brief Language,"" which amounts to the use of the F word once or twice. Other than that, this film is as wholesome as it gets. There is no nudity, sexual situations, violence, or excessive profanity. I would have no problem allowing a 12-year-old to watch this.

The Hammer is a story of friendship, love, and pursuing your dreams. May this film find the success on the small screen that it missed in its limited run theatrical release.",1215561600,3,1662,4.925
3374395,3,B00151QYFS,"I saw this on a DVD Rental (from Blockbuster Online) and noticed that it was listed as ""Excusive Rental"" from them.  Well, I just checked on Netflix and it is available. What gives?  If something is called ""exclusive"" what does that mean?  Sorry, 1 dropped star for this.  I hate Exclusive marketing, with a passion!!!!  I am a big videogamer, and the videogame companies love to use BS Exclusive offers, only to offer them on competing systems just months later, often.  I'm sick of this!

Sorry Adam, 1 dropped star for this (I would have given it 4 stars, without this faux pau.)

I watched this with great interest.  I am a HUGE Adam Carolla fan. I listen to his podcasts religiously.  So my expectations were very high!  I have to say, I was not disappointed.  This was a very funny movie.  I would recommend it to anyone, even if you rent from Netflix, because they rent it there too.

I have to agree about with Adam being upset about this film getting an R Rating. I think I heard one F bomb, and about two P Bombs, but the problem was they came in the first 10 minutes of the film, so that may be the reason why they censors called it R.  It was definitly a PG-13 in my book.  Something to think about next time though.  Spread out the bad words.

The film was also clearly low budget, but that didn't detract from the film's greatness.  Good job!

His eyes got really wide, and he asked in a shocking tone, ""What? Why?!"" I told him that there was one F-bomb in there, and he couldn't even remember where.

It's not all golden though, it was a somewhat low budget film and some times that shows through, mainly through the fight music. However, the rants of Adam Carolla make up for it. This movie had 2 F words (and I have only noticed one of them, I was told that it has 2)  and no other inappropriate elements, yet, it has a R rating.

3374401,4,B00151QYFS,"Carolla, much like Howard Stern in ""Private Parts,"" surprises us with a tender, funny movie that is 3-dimensional without selling out Adam's always-present dark side.
Unlike Stern, Carolla relies on story more than caricature and boobies.  This movie may not be believable in the larger sense, but more importantly it is believable minute by minute.  Like ""Rocky,"" ""The Bad News Bears"" or nurse porn, the movie makes you WANT to believe.
I paid ""The Hammer"" the ultimate compliment- I bought instead of duping it.  We need to support good product, and whether you like ""The Man Show"" or not (it's my least favorite of Carolla's efforts) you will like this movie.
Heather Juergensen is a great, believable pick as the love interest.  She is beautiful the way real women are beautiful- from the inside out.  So many female stars are smoking hot and nothing more.  Unless they're going to get naked, it's boring.  Another part of Carolla's evident maturity is the film's pace.  He also avoids the dogtired formula of the sophomoric schlubs and the hotties who either bust their balls or have a thing for fat losers in need of a shave.  Carolla's characters earn our trust and our empathy.  He does a little ""Annie Hall"" walk-and-zing dating at the LaBrea tarpits; he gives a nod to ""Rounders"" with Jerry's dream-raping girlfriend, and his relationship with his rival light-heavyweight is textured and three-dimensional, like a high-end molded plastic vagina.  Lastly, Ozzie Castillo is a delight.  The Somozista bastards couldn't destroy his great heart.
It's not a perfect film, but it may be a perfect first film.  I'd rank it (genre differences notwithstanding) just below ""Shakes the Clown"" and ""Swingers.""  Of course, both of those films were largely carried by supporting cast members- here Adam carries the movie on his own.
The other performances are fine, it's just that there's no Vince Vaughan-type of foil.
In terms of ""Why didn't they...?"" that's a cheap move made by people who talk about movies but never make them.  The only thing I did that about as I watched was about Adam's arms.  Having some real guns wouldn't have (in my opinion) distanced us from the character who swings a hammer for living, teaches boxing, and has a deadly left.  It's like he went to Steven Segal's action movie training camp.  Now, whenever I hear a fight bell ring a get a craving for KFC....",1215129600,,2385,4.890547263681592

3374415,5,B00151QYFS,"The Hammer is one of the funniest and sweetest movies I've seen in a long time.  The humor is clever and smart and a nice change of pace from recent big budget comedies that rely on stoner/male anatomy humor and gross out gags for easy laughs.  Also, the love story is sweet and convincing as Adam and Heather Juergensen have great on-screen chemistry.

The DVD extras are plentiful and worth checking out.  The commentary provided by Adam and writer Kevin Hench is very entertaining, and the deleted scenes will leave you scratching your head as to why they were cut, particularly the deleted La Brea Tar Pits scene which I thought was hilarious.  The conversation with Ozzie and Adam is also great as Ozzie talks about his journey from being an EMT in Nicaragua to swinging a hammer with Adam in the San Fernando Valley.

This is a great, great movie and should be an indictment on the MPAA because there's no way it deserves its R rating.  There's one F bomb and that's the end of its edginess.

3374433,5,B00151QYFS,"Adam Carolla commented that this movie was about an 8.5, but it had an extra likability and charm to it that other, equally satisfying movies on a technical level, do not have.  That statement defines as well as possible the special affection that most viewers walk away from this film with.  While an 8.5 is rare to find in theaters this day - or decade, there is something that connects with you when watching this film.  Maybe it's due to the universal themes it tells in its story and the fact that it doesn't confine itself to one genre, or any tired production cliches.
In the tale of this main character's life, there are great laughs, tumultuous challenges, determinism, and humanity.  It forgoes the mainstream movie model mold, to have the courage to flow between varying moods to best express these emotions and themes.  One scene may have no laughs, while exploring romance or drama instead.  Each aspect of this story is singularly richer due to that respect of the viewer's intelligence, while working in harmony when the time is right to create a wonderful and rare tapestry of composition, touching on many themes and emotions at once.
This film is composed with that fresh independence and it also looks the part.  Far from a negative point, certain scenes clearly lack the Hollywood polish and relentlessly overproduced timing.  There is a spirit of good friends, who happen to know what good comedy and good art is, getting together with their free time to put it on film - while done professionally and in skillful craft, it is not drowning in its own diluted stylism.
As I said, this film is not one genre more than the other; it's the life of a man who is middle aged and ready to take a chance, who luckily has a great sense of humor along the ride.  In fact, I would place Adam Carolla's character in the same league as Woody Allen and Larry David in that incredibly difficult role of the self-depricating, worldly complainer, whom is still charming and never loses your affection.  Beyond those legendary entertainers often portrayed roles, Carolla adds even more dimensions in his character, in the form of a man who knows when to be serious or romantic, in addition to that inviting wit and humor.
The Hammer is a movie that doesn't come along often.  It may be about an 8.5 on paper, but there is an unbelievably fresh vitality and meaning that comes through above all else and earns your affection; also earning it a near perfect rating, due to it's universal draw and long-unseen unique delivery.  It connects on a level that is reserved for our most beloved classic films.  For that, it is an excellent film with a story you may be familiar with, but delivered with a passion and brilliant humanity the likes of which I've never seen, nor expect to again any time soon.

Went to San Diego opening weekend to see a movie starring the Aceman, Adam Carollla. Wait, only two 'L's in Carolla.

Delete! Delete.

My two regrets about the movie are that I only saw it once, and that my hero Tom Brady isn't in it. As it is, it is only the funniest, wittiest, and best movie of the year, be it independent or studio-driven. If you doubled down and added some Brady, it is the perfect film, bar none.

Don't make the same mistake I did, online movie review readers. Buy two copies of the DVD so you can see it twice. It is that funny. Then send one copy each to the Aceman and Tom Brady, asking that they sign and return. When you don't get either copy back, buy another copy for future enjoyment.

8257214,5,B00151QYFS,"I used to love listening to Adam Carolla on Loveline back in the late 90's, so I consider myself a fan. Still, though, I was really impressed with this movie. He's not a great actor, but he is better than I expected him to be. He's definitely good enough that it doesn't distract from the movie. I would say the same about the budget of the movie. Obviously it was a low budget film, but it's a movie about people not cgi, so it being low budget doesn't really factor in much.

The movie itself is, I guess, a romantic comedy, but it's kind of man's romantic comedy. Carolla's character is getting back into boxing at the age of 40, and he's spent a lot of time working construction. The film has a lot to offer ""masculine"" men who usually don't like romcoms geared more toward women. Much of the dialogue in this movie is about construction (what kind of trowel to use, what kind of screws to use, etc) and boxing (how to use your lower body to create more power behind your punches). My husband, who does work construction, really liked the movie.

Along with all that, however, the movie does focus on the love life of the character. One girl leaves him and he's trying to start a new relationship. I thought the emotional parts were handled well and, for the most part, didn't seem too cheesy.

My favorite thing about the movie was that it was genuinely funny without being hackneyed. I laughed out loud many times. And even though, a summary of it, may make the plot seem somewhat clichd, the dialogue seems genuine and fresh. I found the characters believable and likeable.",1511481600,,1580,4.479166666666667
