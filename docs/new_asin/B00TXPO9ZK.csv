7022955,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"Great addition to any martial arts resource library. Rory Miller always says it as it is. The drills and exercises here are incredibly simple and fun, but serve to show you openings/gifts from your opponents, and also the ones you present to your opponents. I`d recommend seeking out anything by Mr Miller. Always worth the money. But as he says,""once you`ve read/watched it, get up and do it!""",1434412800,3,394,4.8088235294117645
7022956,5,B00TXPO9ZK,Another great DVD by Rory Miller!,1432252800,,33,4.666666666666667
7022957,5,B00TXPO9ZK,This is another extent program form Rory Miller. They did a great job explaining what is going on and giving examples. This is not for someone looking for self-defense or to get into martial arts. This program is for people who are practicing and want to further their art. You will need partners and this program is only helpful if you will practice it!!! It will augment any style very well and an important part of martial arts that I feel gets forgotten a lot.,1431388800,,464,4.470588235294118
7022958,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"As always Rory Miller manages to break down a complex Topic to easy understandable pieces. He has this motivating and entertaining way of teaching and the knowledge and skill to put his teachings on solid ground. Since this is not so much about specific techniques but about principles and general ideas, it might not be perfect for a beginner (but surely worth a try), but really good stuff for the advanced martial artist (or self defense fan). Sometimes the sound is not perfect but the content more then compensates.",1431216000,10,520,4.853932584269663
7022959,5,B00TXPO9ZK,This is a great training video showcasing close range like I have never thought. Rory has years of experience he puts into these DVDs. I like how he takes people he never met from various martial arts and shows how these systems cam adapt this super close range fighting.,1430956800,4,271,4.551020408163265
7022960,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"Rory Miller's DVD INfighting offers great training tips and ideas for practitioners of any martial art, be it TMA (Traditional Martial Art) or MMA (Mixed Martial Art).  As a traditionally trained martial artist with over a decade of instructional experience, I found Sgt. Miller's insights and philosophy about close quarter hand-to-hand combat very insightful and useful by providing a lot of ammo for thought about the potential deficiencies of some traditional arts and how we typically train.  In this DVD, Sgt. Miller demonstrates a ""new"" way of sparring that emphasizes the potential, if not likely, dirty reality of street fighting in a manner that is safe for students, making this a terrific training video.  Practitioners of grappling arts such as judo and jujitsu will be more comfortable with his tactics and methods; practitioners of striking arts may not - and that should be a great reality check.  The viewer can walk away with a handful of methods on hurting opponents at ""zero distance"" that are not typically taught in the traditional setting.

Sgt. Miller comes from a background of experience.  Taken from YMAA's author profile:  He served for seventeen years in corrections working maximum security, booking and mental health; leading a tactical team; and has taught subjects ranging from Defensive Tactics and Use of Force to First Aid and Crisis Communications with the Mentally Ill. For fourteen months he was an advisor to the Iraqi Corrections System working in the combat zones of the Middle East. He holds a BS degree in Psychology and has served in the National Guard as a Combat Medic.  He is an accomplished author (Meditations on Violence, for example).  In summary, he understands the realities of fighting, mental attitude and demeanor, and combat injuries, i.e. how to hurt people and how people get hurt.  Just like his writing style, his presentation style is straight forward, honest, no BS, and to-the-point, adding credence to his authority and expertise.  The guy clearly knows what he is talking about.

The only negative I could think of is that I wish there was some kind of insert in the DVD case that provided an outline or at least a chapter list of the concepts covered in the video making it easier to jump to specific chapters for review.  Regardless, this video will be rewarding to all martial artists, guaranteed!",1430265600,4,2367,5.038461538461538
7022961,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"Like all of Rory Miller's other dvd and book offerings, the ""Infighting"" dvd is packed with great and valuable information.  It is an excellent stand-alone source of info on this subject; and is also an excellent supplement to those other works.  The material presented is very useful and realistic; and practicing these techniques regularly so that your body and mind can develop some instinctive memory of the actions may save your hide some wear and tear, should the appropriate situation arise.  I highly recommend this dvd!",1429488000,,528,5.116279069767442
7022962,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"Infighting by Rory Miller is an excellent follow-up to his other self-protection DVD's and book's. In this DVD, you are shown real fighting techniques which go beyond the martial arts practices. The fighting techniques are shown in well illustrated and demonstrated action scenes in which a person is more likely to find himself.

The action is up real close to the possible opponent and you are shown how to protect yourself as well as how to control and defeat the other person. The action is very real and is done in slow action and then in real time. Some of the movements can be really debilitating as it is very serious type of fighting.

The demonstrators are fighting in close and almost full contact so the student should be aware that injury is possible. Rory Miller lets you know several times over that these movements cannot be learned by sitting on the couch and watching. No matter how many times you watch this
DVD the most important angle is to practice the movements over and over again. The body must learn the muscle memory and the brain has to react in the way you train.

For people willing to learn and actually practice these lessons,  there is a wealth of information and a lot of fun involved. This DVD should be watched in conjunction with Miller's previous self-defense movies and books

To caution how serious this type of in-fighting is, Rory Miller tells you that if you find yourself in this situation, you should think of changing your lifestyle.

Great DVD to add to your collection.",1429142400,,1517,4.684210526315789
7022963,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"Infighting is not a self defense DVD or a means of dealing with violence like Rory Millers work on Scaling Force. Rather it is a method of training and conditioning while still having fun and not getting killed. Unlike other YMAA productions, this one is not filmed using students in uniforms against a blue drape background and shiny wooden floors. Rather, think of the afterhours, underground bars of the early 70's. People in tee shirts, khaki pants, some sneakers some sandals,  some long hair. Dark paneling , dirty drop ceiling tiles, a few hanging lights, two poles in the way and a raised stage with a big brown mattress. Now take that cast of characters and pair them up, big and small, woman and men torso to torso, close enough to gouge, bite and strangle but unable to wing looping punches or big kicks. What you get from those pairings is Infighting, very up close and personal. No room to do katas and no time to do separate offence and defense. You will learn quickly to protect your void spots, (that space at the back of your neck when you are jammed against the others chest), take advantage of the gift of your opponent giving you the sweet spot, ( he overpowers you and jams you to your knees in front of him, don't struggle to get up, go lower and take out his testicles) and you will soon realize that you must remain fluid and follow the flow. You might realize that you can multitask buy gouging and pinching at the same time you sweep a leg and twist a neck. The instructions show how to do things in slow motion first to find the mistakes, then to speed up the flow and finally how to not care about what is coming and focus on your center. If your center and principles are strong, you can offset the opponents center and finish him without punches or kicks. This DVD uses lots of techniques taken from Judo and Karate and turned into close range applications. I have no experience with either of those arts, but I did see some of the same things we use in Xinyi and Bagua, such as whip energy, pi chuan and some of the bagua sticking and turning techniques.
 I always learn something new and interesting with every piece of material produced my YMAA.  Mr. Miller explained why he does not like to choke people and would rather strangle them. Choking cuts off air  usually from the front of the throat, strangling cuts off blood flow, usually from the side of the neck. When people are choked it takes longer and the struggle longer trying to get your hands off of them. When you strangle someone they go down quicker with less fuss. Also, choking can damage the trachea and cause a delayed, unintended death.

Mr. Miller repeats several times that you must get off of the couch, turn off the TV and actually get sweaty, bloody and sometimes even produce a tear of two in order to fully understand Infighting.  He does recommend that you try not to pee or crap your pants though, as that is even a bit too intense for him, although it is not out of the realm of training if that's what it takes to understand. He is not above using the ""F"" word several times and I am not referring to Fun, which he also uses. Have fun, don't get mad, get even.",1428969600,17,3171,4.411965811965812
7022964,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"Products like INFighting are the reason I love Rory Millers work. The purpose of the DVD is to teach a close range, hands on type of sparring that Miller dubs Infighting, essentially, Judo with striking techniques.  Miller breaks down each of the major components of Infighting  namely striking, kicking, locking, throwing, and gouging/pressure point control in an accessible and principles based approach that makes it easy to practice and apply for anyone with at least a little bit of a martial arts background.

If you are a teacher, the material is easy to integrate into any martial arts class. I started drilling it with a few students the other night and ended class by playing the Infighting game, it was a blast, we all left sweaty, a bit beat up, and with huge smiles on our faces.

The only drawback to the DVD is that it does not cover ground fighting at all. For as frequently as you will find yourself on your back while playing Infighting, a principles based section like the ones presented for the other elements of the game would have been appreciated, especially for those with no background in grappling arts.

INFighting is a rough-and-tumble and aggressive game. If you really don't like getting hit, you may want to avoid this one. For me, however, it was the most fun I had doing martial arts in a long time!",1428537600,7,1332,4.6995708154506435
7022965,5,B00TXPO9ZK,Rory Miller is one of the best people in business of personal protection.,1452211200,,73,4.6923076923076925
7022966,1,B00TXPO9ZK,"A pathetic dvd, that's all I'm saying. Unlike the doctored cover, where the ""supposed"" cop us nailing someone across the jaw, they spend this dvd doing what the wannabe officer calls ""play time"" (I'm not kidding you either) and  he pantomimes the moves on a stoic partner. They then wrestle and laugh together. The use of the term ""Goomba's"" in his dvds in slightly offensive, since he may not know that at one time it was derogatory against us Italian-Americans. He says this in his other dvd mainly, once or twice ""Scaling Force"".

This guy can't even hold his breath, is out of shape, and you hear him heaving on the microphone. It's like seeing an out of shape gym instructor or trainer, it's de-motivating. Suck it in bro, suck it in. He's thin in the shoulders, but got a gut from the side.

Overall it's an awful dvd. This is ""imitation fighting"",where no moves are actually done, and it's horrendous when he says right off the bat that we'd learn nothing visually from any video, let alone his video, cuz it's impossible to. I'm sorry, what? Why are you even selling this as a dvd then?!? It's like, tell me, since you can't prove you are a cop and home instructor, why should I even keep your product? Instantly returned this dvd! Over an hour waste of time.

Try Kelly McCann's dvds. He's also known as Jim Grover. One is his pen name. He trained top security firms in private security and developed a street fighting method you where CAN learn a few things from home. Especially, on a dummy (like the BOB XL, for instance). I am not advertising for his methods, but rather advocating for them. They look a little different at first, but what he teaches is street fighting, not martial arts.

I recommend checking it out even though it's more expensive. You get what you pay for at least! I sure got a big reminder of that premise with this wannabe's collection! I can't understand all the positive reviews...very strange, 15-20 positive reviews on some dvds and yet the content is not worth it at all.

EDIT 9/26/15:

Some reviewers are saying this is Not a self-defense dvd like the others like it's justification of an issue. If anything, it should be MORE of a self-defense dvd than than others. Let me copy and paste from the description to prove it:

You will learn basic Infighting Building Blocks, including:
Moving a Body
Locks
Takedowns
Gouges
Striking
Kicking
Leverage
Strangles and Chokes
Spine Manipulation

None of this was shown at all. Only when he said stop and ""I COULD have done this to them"", making a take down gesture, can he even remotely say he tried  ""In Fighting"". You learn nothing from home.",1448496000,6,2629,4.610278372591006

7022968,5,B00TXPO9ZK,"This DVD was sent to me directly from YMAA for review.

All real time, close-quarters, hand-to-hand encounters involving lethal force, be it is urban warfare, battlefield combat or security/law enforcement/civilian scenarios, possess key consistencies, regarding the successful kinematic applications of principles needed to prevail in this arena of lethality and control. Few contemporary martial disciplines integrate all of these principles into their daily curricula. It was good to see Rory Miller, both instructing and integrating several of these consistencies in his new INFIGHTING training DVD, beyond a mere sporting menu.

This 79 minute, full-color/NTSC instructional DVD provides a delicate balance between solid sports applications with combative kinematics needed to navigate close-quarters combatives, with a degree of fitness and athleticism. Miller does verbally make the distinction between the sporting arena and the combative arena. I would have liked to have witnessed these distinctions continuing throughout the video, comparing sports applicability to combative applicability. This is the one weakness of the video. The two arenas remain movement and mindset specific, of which this fact was conveyed in the video, but not specifically clarified in each application. The blending of sport and combat were, at times, seamless, which misleads the viewer, at times.

Within this DVD, Mr. Miller offers instructional chapters including his training methodology under the Chiron Training paradigm (www.chirontraining.com), plus applications for moving the body, creating locks, capitalizing on takedowns, engaging gouges and biting, deploying hand striking, kicking, leverage points each human possesses, strangles and chokes, spine manipulations, elements of defense, components of time, and chaining techniques as the adversary provides (stacking/gifts).

When we critically inspect this list of applications from a close-quarters stand-point, coupled with a need to potentially control a lethal adversary, the consistencies needed to successfully accomplish this task revolves around swiftly and abruptly, engaging three-dimensional movement void of any lulls in those applications, against a resistant adversarys head and hips, achieving relative-superiority in this process. Millers DVD of INFIGHTING actually addresses this. Maybe not in these specific terms, but this message is conveyed throughout his instructions of the aforementioned chapters of how to work against your training partner.

For comparison, many of the training applications of slow, supple, relaxed flowing drills, remind me of similar movements found in the Russian Systema, and those drills found throughout the various forms of neijiaquan disciplines. The kinesiologic value of such drills are immeasurable in developing essential procedure memory of critical psychomotor skills to the automaticity required for one wanting to be able to prevail in a violent, close-quarters encounter.

Miller provides a solid beginning peek, addressing several core-consistencies (timing, positioning, head and hip control, abrupt three-dimensional movement, driven through the adversary, and allowing the opponent to dictate what we need to engage) found in real-time CQB. Obviously not all the consistencies can be covered in a 79 minute DVD, comprehensively, but this video offers important stepping stones toward the development of a strong and solid foundation needed to navigate such intense waters found in CQB.

There are many more valuable lessons waiting to be uncovered in this INFIGHTING arena, including weapons, that I hope Rory Miller and YMAA will address in future DVD packages.  Rory Miller remains an individual most capable for addressing such future topics.

I highly recommend this DVD as a good starting point for immersion into the deep waters of CQB.

Rory breaks down amazing things like power generation from close distances, joint locks, disruptions, strikes, and more.

The concepts were amazing, and the exercises and drills he shows were extremely useful - I have begun incorporating them into my own training and my martial arts classes.

The only thing I found less-than-useful were the scenes of students practicing, I imagine that one could learn from watching them perform the techniques, but I didn't find I got much out of it - it's something you just have to practice on your own.

This is another fine DVD from Rory Miller. Miller is an experienced martial artist, experienced corrections officer, an experienced trainer, and an analytical thinker with a degree in psychology. His books and DVDs tend to be very well done and interesting on many levels. This one is no exception.
In In-fighting, Miller is up to his usual high standards and focuses on an important and interesting topic. The cover claims that this DVD will develop your close-range combat reflexes and the DVD focuses on exactly that. Miller describes the focus as martial arts, and not self-defense. The intent is to focus on improving fighting when the fighters are at clinch range which he also describes as torso to torso or halitosis range.
Miller is an experienced trainer and a master teacher. He begins by discussing how to learn the techniques and principles taught in the DVD. Play, he says, more than once, and he emphasizes repeatedly that to learn the materials on the DVD one must go out and practice. The format of the DVD is like Millers other DVDs. There are a group of people in a place, Miller teaches, explains, and demonstrates, then the students practice as Miller comments and clarifies. Personally, Ive seen all five of Millers DVDs and felt this format fits four of the five (there was one, Scaling Force, that I thought would have been done better with a different format), and it fits this one, as well.
For an hour and 18 minutes, the group practices and Miller explains and clarifieds. Subjects covered include not just techniques like throws, sweeps, chokes, and strikes, as well as ways to destroy the opponents structure and the use of leverage and leverage points, but also training methodology and some of the building blocks required to develop the skills that the video is designed to impart. These building blocks include an introduction to how to move peoples bodies, locks, and takedowns. Its all well done and well explained and well demonstrated.
In conclusion this is well done DVD. A martial arts teacher or class could easily use it as the basis for many drills and useful skill building practice. The concepts are interesting, the techniques clearly explained, this is a good addition to most martial arts libraries.",1435190400,6,2304,4.953488372093023
