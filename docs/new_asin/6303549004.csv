683573,5,6303549004,"Wow! I cannot get this movie out of my thoughts, it was an excellent portrayal of the turbulent marriage between T. S. Eliot and his lovely wife, Vivienne. First of all here is a 'bravo' to Miranda Richardson and  Willem Dafoe, they obviously spent many hours perfecting the characters  they portrayed so well. I understood what each were going through and it  was a tragedy in the end that they could not live their lives together. It  was obvious the love was there, but it was a sad, misunderstood love.  Excellent job Mandy, you've proved your great acting capabilities to me  once again, you never let your fans down do you? I highly recommend this  movie to anyone, it was amazing and I cannot quit thinking about it.",946684800,13,723,4.6015625

683611,3,6303549004,"""Tom and Viv"" (1994) a Miramax biopic starring Willem Dafoe as the world-famous 20th century anglophile American poet T.S. Eliot, (""The Wasteland,"" ""The Four Quartets"") and Miranda Richardson as his unfortunate wife Vivienne Haigh-Wood, opens on the Oxford school days of the poet -- who was initially from St. Louis.  We find him studying with Lord Bertrand Russell, well-known anti-war philosopher: another of Russell's students is Vivienne's brother, upon whose memories this film is based.  It was filmed on location, around Oxford and London, and garnered two Oscar nominations, plus two other awards.

Tom and Viv elope, and it's basically all downhill from there: she has gynecological and emotional problems that disrupt even the honeymoon.  Dafoe does the best he can with a part that's not written on the page: Richardson turns in one of her trademark manic performances.  Rosemary Harris almost carries the picture as Viv's worried mum. We meet, briefly, the celebrated early 20th century literary group that centered around Bloomsbury, London-- Virginia Woolf and company.  We get the obligatory slow Oxford river boating scenes, but the story stays slow, and doesn't really go anywhere.  The sound's often bad, and the film's confusing.  It raises the issue of why Eliot behaves as he did; and though you can't insist that a movie should do so, it doesn't answer the questions it's raised.  It's the kind of movie, unfortunately, that gives art films a bad name.",1188777600,4,1475,5.189873417721519
683612,3,6303549004,"I have watched ""Tom & Viv"" a few times now. After the first time, my foremost thought was ""What a looney!"", in regards to Vivien Eliot and her behavior. But, after more careful viewing and consideration, I've reconsidered that initial, first impression. While Vivien most definitely suffered from psychological problems, compounded by a hormonal condition, it is also a well known fact that physicians of the day considered most emotional and psychological problems in women to  be due to ""hysteria"", due to the fact that women had female parts.  Seriously, some doctors (or practioners calling themselves such) thought such ""hysteria"" could be controlled by either genital stimulation or hysterectomy. Both of these are outrageous and extreme, but then again, in this day and age, so is the idea of ""moral insanity"".  Then again, if T.S. Eliot WAS as much of a stiff and a prig as this movie implies, who can blame her for pouring chocolate into his mail slot, when some snotty secretary throws the chocolate bar she leaves her husband back out of the slot? C'mon... what woman hasn't been pissed enough at her husband/boyfriend to do something ""extreme"", at one time or another.  Take her emotional/mental state, add the hormonal imbalance and then consider, is it HER fault she acts on her impulse? Granted, she loses it completely with the knife/taxicab incident, but then again, earlier in the film, we overhear that she is being given ETHER, as treatment!!! The ignorance of the medical profession of that time makes one shudder!!! This film is, if nothing else, a window onto a terrible time in history for women. The ignorance with which they are treated and the patriarchal mindset of society leaves them precious little way in defense of themselves. Vivien had no where to turn for help, her father having left Tom in charge of her monies. She was probably quite desperate and couldn't do anything at all to help herself. If Tom was as dedicated to the church and conforming to society's ""norms"", her life must've been hell. You can see the utter helplessness on her face when the ""inquisitors"" come to ""quiz"" her, to see if she's crazy or not. (And, the ""quiz"" is ridiculous!!!) Then, the poor thing is grabbed up while having tea with a friend, in public!!! How awful! Just think what todays medicine could have done for her. Why, even back then, she's finally told there IS help for her, and that she has been left to rot by Tom... it's just so sad. It's all a sad commentary on society's treatment of women. If she had been born today, she might have been a brilliant author (or whatever), in her own right. Miranda Richardson may be playing it ""over the top"", as some have said, but then again, what if that was how it was? How tragic, for both Vivian, and in the end, Tom, as well. Remember, as this movie tells it, he was never informed of her ""conditions"" before their wedding. If this is true, he was tricked into a life of hell, by both her and her family.  And, given what recourse he had, what could he have done? But, without their life together, would we have a work like ""The Wasteland""? Hmm... food for thought. Anything with Willem Dafoe, Miranda Richardson and the rest of this marvelous cast is still better than most of the pap that Hollywood churns out... any day.",1152316800,6,3295,4.713541666666667
683613,3,6303549004,"I studied Eliot in college, wrote a couple of papers about his poetry, did all the research about the references in the ""Waste Land,"" studied the editing of his poetry by Ezra Pound (who is glaringly, completely absent in this movie), read Eliot's criticisms, and listened to the recordings of Eliot reading his poetry. I have great respect for Eliot as a poet, but when I saw that there was a dramatic movie about him I thought, my God, how could that be anything but boring? Well, I wasn't completely bored. There was a certain gripping in the question of ""what to do with Viv?"" There certainly wasn't much of anything at all to do with his poetry. Richardson's performance kept any life there was in this film. What in the world was going on with Dafoe's performance? It just went from stiff to stiffer. It was inhuman. You could have put a lampshade on his head and stuck him in the corner for awhile. I worried that someone would bump into him and they wouldn't be able to get him back up off the floor. Watching this has definitely colored my mental image of T.S. Eliot, and not for the better. Beware of this if you have interest in the real Eliot. The question is, of course, is there any truth in this? It's hard to believe, but what do I know? Perhaps it was an attempt to turn Eliot into one of ""the hollow men."" If it was, it was pretty dumb. I give it three stars for the historical recreation, the performances of everyone except the very questionable performance of Dafoe, and the attempt, at least, at making an intelligent film. I did really like the Dante-like ending, though, and perhaps that was a last minute idea that could have rescued this film--if they had used strong, fragmented, referential imagery like that throughout the movie which reflected Eliot's Wasteland poetry. At least that would have given me some indication that the filmakers had actually read any of it.",1150934400,7,1897,4.5659824046920825
683614,3,6303549004,"What a strange little movie. First: Willem Dafoe as T.S. Eliot. Way too physical and intense, too New York, to make a convincing Eliot. At 39, he's too old for the young Eliot at the beginning and too young for the weary wartime Eliot we see at the end. Yet stick with it, the pacing and intonation (carefully cribbed from recordings of Eliot's readings) gain power over time. By the end I almost believed. But not quite!

Next: Miranda (""Viv"") Richardson. The movie can't seem to make up its mind about her. A brilliant woman eclipsed by her husband's fame? A free spirit suffocated by Eliot's need for a stodgy English life? Victim of an undiagnosed hormonal imbalance? Of a patriarchal society where the Lunacy Act and the male trustees her father leaves her fortune to (Eliot and her brother, as it happens) conspire to lock her up?  A high-strung eccentric (chocolate in the mail slot) or stark raving mad? The movie flirts with all these options without really digging into any one of them.

Eliot too appears alternately as a duped lover, loving caretaker, and cold-hearted ogre who locks his wife away when she threatens to hurt his career. The upshot is that you never know these two at all. Why they fall in love, why they keep insisting they're in love through a sterile marriage, what makes either of them brilliant, what each needed in the other--we're told without ever really being shown. Blame it on the narrator, Viv's brother, whose reminiscences formed the basis of the play this movie's based on. Off to the war and then to Africa, conservative and cheerily philistine about what makes England England, he's not the best person to get inside a literary couple like Tom & Viv. The upshot? A middle-of-the-road period piece that trots out a series of clichs without showing much interest in getting beyond the surface of this brilliant, tragic couple.",1139875200,10,1869,4.780185758513932
683615,3,6303549004,"Watching TOM & VIV is an exercise in frustration.  In fact, it reminded me of all that's suspect about film biographies.  Too sketchy on the one hand, and taking too many liberties with the facts on the other.  (Those may be interrelated problems, come to think of it, both stemming from the near impossibility of compressing a whole life into two hours.)  Every once in a while, something like KINSEY comes along that tells its tale in an original and fairly comprehensive way.  But this 1994 release is not of that order.

In fact the nagging sensation that I got from viewing TOM & VIV was that I was really taking the lazy man's way out.  I didn't know much about T.S. Eliot's life before. And I didn't learn a heck of a lot from this movie either.  I don't know about you, but when a fact-based movie leaves me feeling that way, I tend to feel cheated.  You may not always know if there's a superior book or other source material out there (this movie is based on a play, which may or may not have actually been better), but a movie like this makes you feel like you need to do a whole lot more research before you can even talk about such key issues as: whether or not it's accurate; whether or not it's fair;  whether or not it even begins to approach the truth of its subjects' lives.

Miranda Richardson and (in a surprisingly understated way) Willem Dafoe try their level best to bring depth to their underwritten parts.  The film wants to be somewhat fair, and while many viewers (see some of the critiques below) will probably come away thinking that Eliot was a ""monster,"" it is apparent that the film is actually trying for a somewhat more nuanced view.  A bit of a cad, certainly a prig--and an artist who fled from emotion rather than embracing it.  But did he cruelly institutionalize his mentally unstable wife and deliberately keep her there even after it became clear that she was suffering more from hormonal imbalance rather than insanity?  Or was he simply acting out of the same ignorance as all her doctors and, for that matter, her family?  Since he did not act alone in these matters, it hardly seems fair to single him out for vilification.

Or maybe it does.  But we need more facts, s'il vous plait. And maybe a better narrative would help.  Apparently, there was some difficulty getting the estate's permission to quote extensively from Eliot's actual poetry.  The one or two examples of same are riveting and suggestive of what this movie could have been had it focused more on the artist's art--and if it had given us a glimpse or two more of the nature of the Eliots' actual collaboration.  Vivienne is described as his muse and his best reader, but that's the problem.  She's DESCRIBED.  We don't see much of their supposed collaboration (well, there is a scene where they're reviewing proofs of THE WASTELAND) and wind up pretty much having to take the characters' word for it.

There were moments when I was reminded of another film about a genius who married badly and whose wife wound up in an asylum.  Ken Russell's MUSIC LOVERS covered much of the same ground.  And while many found Russell's film wildly uneven, it had panache and a kind of reckless energy that a more staid, solmemn piece like TOM & VIV could benefit from.

When all is said and done, the film leaves you wondering which is worse: the moral failings of artists or the artistic failings of moralists.",1129248000,9,3409,4.555008210180624
683616,4,6303549004,"It's plain and simple that TS Eliot was a monster!!  Viv was a highly intelligent, creative and very misunderstood woman.  Good Grief, she was married to a stick who had no business marry a woman with all her livliness.  Today, Viv would be the life of the party, and Tom, Tom who!!  She had no where to go with all her creativity and that would make anyone mad.  She was suffering from hormonal imbalance, not insanity.  Poor Viv. There was no one who understood what she was going through.  And those ridiculous doctors! Idiots!! And then with HER money, he has her commited. A perfectly sane woman commited and just freaking leaves her there!!! But the part in the movie that I loved, was when her mother let him have it. If I were Viv's mother, I probably would have said it the same calm and classy way she did and then I would've of added by screaming ""Now give me back every penny of Viv's money, you ratbastard!!!

683619,2,6303549004,"And yet the movie is too long. What's to ""dissect"" in their relationship? She's mentally unstable, he's incredibly straightlaced ... and the film doesn't feel it has to show us any more than this, over and  over. I realize it's constrained by a) being adapted from a play and b) the  Eliot estate's stinginess with permission to quote (I do like the way some  lines from ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" are sprinkled  innocuously in the dialogue, though). But it sure makes him out to be the  bad guy, staying married to her only because he's in charge of her family's  estate and good Anglicans do not get divorced. You see the trouble she had,  and then some, but you don't see that he, too, was pushed to the edge of a  nervous breakdown in 1921. As a longtime fan of Eliot's poetry, I can  certainly that the writers and directors of this film have an understanding  of its dispassionate nature and the man who could create that ... but there  had to be more to Old Possum than this stiff and cold portrait.",963964800,8,1017,4.413978494623656
7850515,5,6303549004,"I don't have a history of the story or of the people for whom this movie is about, but I loved it when I saw it many years ago.  It showcases the misunderstanding and lack of knowledge in women's health issues in the 1920's (and even into the 60's and 70's).  Viv is actually an intelligent woman with a burdensome health issue.  When unaffected she's bright, personable and far more capable than her husband.  She is the brains and backbone when she's healthy, but untreatable hormone issues sends her off the grid at times.  The ending is sad and makes one ache for her plight.  I watched this film again with my daughter who was in med school at the time, to show her what women went through for centuries until research came up with medications to help curtail the symptoms.  Tom turns out to be a jerk in the end.  I know there are people who defend him as a victim in his own right, much the same as one defends any abuse.  But the fact is, there is no exuse.  Nobody had a gun to his head forcing him to stay.  Is institutionalizing your wife away, even after a visit from American doctors advising him of help available, more noble than a divorce?  If he stayed in a situation (by his lust for money) that , by his own choice, drove him nearly to a nervous break-down, then in the end, he proves himself to be a  greedy, manipulative, narcissist.",1456099200,,1354,4.325396825396825

7850518,2,6303549004,"Mister T.S. Eliot was a conservative  Anglo Catholic ex-pat American ex-banker who associated with the fascist anti-semitic Ezra Pound but that being as it may does not automatically kill this film screen play that is the product byproduct of Mr. Michael Hastings where today even with Mr. Eliot's questionable history he rises to mythic proportions.

I myself was introduced to his work thorough an audio product of his work ""Murder in THe Cathedral"" ""a verse drama by T. S. Eliot that portrays the assassination of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170, first performed in 1935"" in what this films causes me to rethink his hypocritical manner as he asks in that play of Becket ""do you"" serve your ""king or your god"" to which I beg to argue that it seems TS Eliot as the corrupted blue blood Harvard educated cur seems to have thought himself but king and god. At which point I question his internment in the  Poets Corner of  of Westminster Abbey in England. Perhaps he served his country well and that was not the United States as he preferred England and became English though not I may add a good Englishman but a rake, a coward, a scoundrel; and a good writer who was a cultural parasite that was placed in a position at Faber and Faber as an old connected part of the ""firm""  to be enabled through means of advancing like minded high society poison (minds) of many in the general public while his world was dying on the battle fields of WWI and WWII from which he learned little. As Faber and Faber see to survive today based on their tricks of the trade.

This film on TS Eliot and his first wife I have to judge it for it fails for many reasons not because a lack of good acting and production but because the script in question is second rate in what is ironic a first class writer who was a second class human being depicted by first rate acting in a second rate film script. As I saw better aristocrats and accents depicted in the films of the 1940s where they had some first hand experiences with those sorts.

The film in review simply failed, as it failed to mention Ezra Pound and the those around Eliot and the influence of fascist and right wing on the upper crust of British society prior to WWII as it was a film that referenced WWI as a mere simply a skimpy footnote though approx 33% of the 1914 graduating class at Oxford attended (TS Eliot's class) were killed on the battlefields of a very stupid war in Europe to preserve the empires that financed the very stupid shallow people TS Eliot was so impressed with in what he represented and in life mingled with well as it is interesting to note that he seemingly was soullessly depicted by this film which can be seen as a success though of whom I am unsure.

So I blast it with two stars only as though I do not hate it I without seeing it in some greater sense do not like it.",1393891200,,2870,4.40188679245283
7850519,5,6303549004,"I very much liked this biographical study of T. S. Eliot and his first wife.  It showed Eliot in a good light dealing with an obviously sick woman.  Unlike the critic's take on Dafoe's acting, I  thought he was womderful as was the actress who played his wife.. This film held my interest through out. and I would watch it again.",1388188800,,329,4.360655737704918
7850520,3,6303549004,"I read Eliot's poetry in college and liked it a lot, but knew very little of his personal life.  So I was very interested in this film.  From reading some of the comments from people who knew more of the facts of Eliot's life, this film doesn't seem to shed much real light.  We get some facts--he was an American Anglophile who met and quickly married a wealthy Englishwoman.  It seemed to be a perfect case of opposites attracting and then repelling.  He was more English than the King and she wanted to be free of the constraints of her culture. We first see her kicking up her heels and throwing caution to the wind. She romanticized being poor and criticized him for taking a sensible job in a bank. He becomes more and more straight-laced, spends a considerable ammount of time with the Anglican bishop and eventually joins the church...while Viv creates scenes wherever she goes and even pulls a knife on Virginia Woolf in a taxi.

The film is confusing in that we don't really know what Vivienne's problem was.  At first it seems that the problem was physical--she had irregular periods.  But then it became evident that her mood swings were much worse than that problem would account for.  The film is a Rorshack test for viewers' attitudes;  some believe that Viv was just a high-spirited, brilliant girl who was thwarted by Eliot's stuffiness.  Some call Eliot an outright monster who married her for her money and drained her life away.  I saw a different picture--that of a long-suffering man who seemed to be deeply in love with a genuinely mentally ill woman and who put up with her outrageous behavior for many years before finally consenting to have her hospitalized.  This decision was made jointly with her mother and brother, and at the recommendation of her doctors. I was reminded of Lincoln, another long suffering man who loved and put up with a very difficult wife.

The last part, showing Viv in the mental hospital where she seemed perfectly sane and looked  wonderfully healthy, was confusing. Had she only been suffering from an undiagnosed hormonal imbalance and was she then receiving treatment for it?  Is that why she seemed well?  If she had been genuinely cured, why didn't anyone bother to release her?  Eliot was back in the US and her brother was in Africa but weren't they in communication?  It's hard to believe that the whole family just dumped her in this hospital and forgot about her.

The character of the mother is shown in a confusing way, too.  For most of the film she is very sympathetic to Eliot.  Then there is a dramatic scene in which she blames him for wrecking Viv's life and her own.  Rosemary Harris is sublime, as usual, but even she doesn't make this credible.  I had to wonder, too, why the family didn't intervene in Viv's illness much earlier and just seemed content to let Eliot bear the whole burden of caring for her.

The ending tries to say that, in spite of their separation that they each harbored a deep love for the other.  It's a nice try but wasn't really believable.

In a way the film seems exploitative---taking the tragic events of a well-known man, bringing them to the world but not in a way that offers any clarity or light. It left me depressed and I think Eliot would have hated it.",1365292800,2,3265,4.613518197573657

As ever, I am amused by some of the more stern and unforgiving reviews elsewhere on Amazon; for some people nothing is ever good enough and too many people just cannot wait (as we say in the UK) "" to put the boot in"" and damn a perfectly serious, well-crafted, if rather grim little movie. If you are looking for a feel-good, relaxing film - this isn't it, but I found it intelligent and sensitive in the manner that it portrays poor Viv sympathetically and Eliot's heroic devotion to her and his marriage vows. It is certainly valuable, too, in the manner that it illuminates Eliot's poetry; links between his circumstances and their married life are subtly established when the dialogue echoes famous lines, or excerpts from the poems sparingly comment upon the content of the film. Eliot is expertly embodied by Willem Dafoe; he comes across as more English than the English, complete with a rather (deliberately exaggerated?) clipped English accent and a permanent case of emotional constipation which found its release in the verse. As Eliot says in the film, poetry is expression ""free from emotion"" - and that really shows here. Miranda Richardson gives a chilling and touching performance as Viv, bringing out her qualities as well as her frightening afflictions; we realise to what degree theirs was a relationship of mutual dependence - though I would have liked more on Ezra Pound's influence over Eliot's final drafts. The film is dark-hued yet sometimes funny. Apart from its intrinsic value, it is very useful as a teaching aid, helping my students to understand the historical context of the texts we are studying and the biographical circumstances behind the verse. So even if others claim that the film taught them nothing, I have to say that it enhanced our appreciation of a great poet.",1223510400,5,1926,4.804216867469879
7850523,4,6303549004,"Tom and Viv  (Brian Gilbert, 1994)

Brian Gilbert's quietly heartbreaking drama Tom and Viv came and went with barely a blip at the box office, though it did get nominated for two Academy Awards; it should have been much more widely seen, I think. But what does the American moviegoing public, especially in the nineties, care for the life and marriage of a poet? For Tom and Viv are T. S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe, once again ignored by the Academy) and his mentally unstable wife Vivienne (Miranda Richardson, who did get a nomination for Best Actress).

The plot is simple and straightforward: American expatriate Tom, who according to the narration of Vivienne's brother Maurice (Tim Dutton) is trying to out-English the English, finds everything he's looking for in England in the person of Vivienne: she's upperclass, moneyed, a member of the British society, but with a wild, untameable streak. He falls in love and they elope, realizing only after they're married that Vivienne isn't just high-spirited, she's quite mentally unsound. Thus, Tom is brought in under the wing of Vivienne's family, made one of them by proxy, and much of the film alternates between Tom's attempts to handle Viv's erratic behavior and him commiserating with various family members. Finally, with everyone at the end of their collective rope, Tom and Maurice come up with a plan that will satisfy everyone except Vivienne herself.

This is a film that plays itself very close to the vest. It's staid, almost glacial on the surface, but simmers beneath with rage and despair. Dafoe and Richardson are both brilliant in their roles, and make an essentially plotless biopic into gripping viewing. Highly recommended. ****",1201046400,7,1699,5.057142857142857
7850524,3,6303549004,"With a sound cast headed by Miranda Richardson and Willem Dafoe, Tom & Viv is a good film about a spirited woman dealt an unfair hand in life, and the selfish man she married. It's also a slightly shocking film for portions of its subject matter, including some parts that might make certain male audience members squirm.

The story itself really made me dislike T.S. Eliot: and for once it was for more than just his---I think---bad poetry. This film tells what was once only whispered among Eliot scholars and was later forgotten, that being Eliot's unforgivably callous treatment of his decidedly hormonally unbalanced first wife, Viv. True, the ""mercurial"" and foul-mouthed proto-Flapper Vivienne Eliot was no doubt a trial for someone like the choleric Tom to bear, in fact they were a mismatched pair from the start, but for a man to lock his wife away for the duration of her remaining life, including for years long past the time there was any medical need for it (assuming there ever was)...it takes a cold being to be capable of that.

Never having been a fan of Eliot's work, I don't know enough about the details of the marriage at the heart of this story to comment on any errors this movie contained, but if it is reflective of the actual fate of Mrs. Eliot, then it's something people ought to know about the man whose playful little jottings gave us the musical Cats as well as those (IMHO) painfully awful pieces endemic in college textbooks, Murder in the Cathedral, and The Waste Land.

Good performances and a worthy revelation about a literary icon's heartlessness in his private life, but ultimately only three and a half stars, primarily for the fact that the script as written wasn't able to fully sustain the story at its final length.",1197158400,2,1760,4.726384364820847
