This is obviously a trip into Alexis Arquette's narcistic childish fantasy.... like grow up!. The title of the movie is great, thats what sucked me in. The film quality is ""home movie"" quality, the DVD and jacket look like it was ""knocked up"" on someones home computor. The dialogue is so imature and very unfunny,a couple of two year olds dressed in mommy's clothes could have done better. Destined for the trash can Im afraid! Dont buy it and waste your money. Dont say I didn't warn you. The money spent making this movie is a complete waste, Id rather give the money spent making and producing this movie to homeless bums.

8157531,1,B000KJU0YW,"I wanted this movie because of Alexis Arquette.  I knew it was a low budget, dumb movie. Something to watch on a rainy day.",1478563200,,123,4.125
8157532,4,B000KJU0YW,Good B movie. It was fun to watch.,1442707200,,34,3.375
8157533,1,B000KJU0YW,If you loved Starrbooty you might think this is fair but I doubt it. It is about the same quality which is extremely poor. The Arquette family black sheep proves he can't carry a movie here. This is like a bad Youtube video at best. Skip it!,1375142400,,241,4.148936170212766
8157534,4,B000KJU0YW,"This movie is super funny and ridiculous, which is just what I was looking for.  The problem is that the copy I purchased as a gift for my friend had issues, and refused to play the last 25% of the film.",1368835200,,203,3.951219512195122
8157535,1,B000KJU0YW,"God... As a gay man, I grow weary of watching such abhoring, and pointless creations...I was expecting something hillarious, but instead we are stuck with lifeless (litterally) character references, & a REALLY pointless storyline...

Again, The film is as dumbed down as its title suggests, it would be EASILY classified as ""Snuff Film"", because ALL you see throughout the film is two TERRIBLY tragic drag queens, killing people, the agents & agencies responsible for the killings, and, as if it weren't obvious enough, them two, getting off on a vast array of class A drugs...

All this and there seems to be a soupcon of humour, and I truly don't know if it even classifies as laughable... I had to tickle myself to be able to afford even a smile while watching this.

If you want to watch drug diffused drag queens, killing people that they have been asked to, with over acted & under-dialogued characters, then go ahead & buy the dvd. For the rest of you, who ARE indeed wondering if this is a b-grade comedy or not, get yourself a copy of ""Dance Flick"", because at least you'll get a few great laughs from that! With this one, You ain't missing much!",1312070400,,1155,4.624390243902439
8157536,4,B000KJU0YW,"At a first glance, ""Killer Drag Queens on Dope"" is a film that, depending on one's mood, comes across as either annoyingly stupid or hilariously campy.  But dig a little deeper, and you realize that it's actually a clever gender-bending of any number of stereotypes involving not only realworld masculine and feminine roles, but also hackneyed Hollywood portrayals of men and women.

It's also, by the way, just an incredibly fun film to watch.  Alexis Arquette as Ginger, one of the drag queen killers, steals the whole show with her acting versatility.  (She's also gorgeous, by the way.)  Omar Alexis' performance as her sidekick Coco is also good (ditto on the gorgeous part), as is Don Edmonds' deadpanned and hilarious performance as Uncle A, the mafia don.

Things move from fun to interesting when you realize just how many gender stereotypies get busted by this movie.  Bobby, Ginger's studly boyfriend and Uncle A's designated hitman, is too squeamish to pull off his assignments, and hands them over to his girl, Ginger.  On the other hand, Ginger and Coco, feminine in an over-the-top way, are perfectly able and willing to whack guys.  Uncle A's very masculine henchmen are all buffoons who, although kinda lovable, are ""girly"" in their timidity.  And Uncle A, who comes across as a brutal piece of work somewhere between Don Corleone and Charles Manson, does a surprising bit of gender-bending himself at film's end.

Sets are minimalistic, the sound is sometimes tinny, and occasionally the editing is choppy and abrupt.  I don't know if all this is a consequence of an extremely low budget, or if it's an intentional mimicking of the poor quality of the cheap 1970s exploitation films that ""Killer Drag Queens"" seems to be spoofing.  But either way, it works.",1213574400,4,1775,4.956081081081081
8157537,4,B000KJU0YW,"I expected this movie to be crap, but it's really quite charming. Ginger, super unbeatable hit woman, and her BFF CoCo, are a fabulous killing team. Well, Ginger kills and CoCo lends moral support. Ginger's boyfriend, Bobby, has been ordered by his crime family to do some hits, but he's farmed out the job to Ginger and CoCo (who do wonderful kills that include drawing fake eyes on the lids of one of their marks!). But when it comes out that Bobby isn't really doing the hits, his family is mortified, and now Ginger and CoCo are being hunted! This is a campy, kitchy film with lots of great moments: ginger on a roller-derby killing spree, the ladies having a tea-party with acid sugar cubes...really quite sharp!",1191456000,,717,4.653543307086614
8157538,4,B000KJU0YW,"PLOT:
'Killer Drag Queens On Dope'. The title of the film says it all. Alexis Arquette (A.K.A. Eva Destruction) and Omar Alexis play 2 drag queens, Ginger and Coco, who are hired killers. The movie get's crazier with Coco's Lovely Linda Doll obsession, and Ginger(Alexis Arquette)'s romance. Oh, yeah, and they do some drugs. (Nothing worse that what you see on TV.)

PRO'S AND CON'S:
This is not an Oscar Award winning film and is rather low budget. The fight scenes are below the Matrix level, but flow smoothly. I think it just adds to the humor. The music is enjoyable. It has a 70's buddy-cop sound to it. You know, the funky guitar along with some techno beats.

This film is light and upbeat. With Coco's doll obsession, the crazy 'jobs', and wacky characters, this film is very comical! I found myself laughing often throughout the movie.

WHAT I LEARNED

There are 4 things I learned from this film:

1. Be your fabulous self and proud!
2. Being 'in-between' male and female can be the best of both worlds.
3. When planning a murder in costume, make sure your weapons matche your outfit.
4. Alexis Arquette has nice legs (I think I knew that before though...)

RATING:
My rating? 4 Lovely Linda Dolls out of 5
(4/5)",1182038400,5,1224,4.591743119266055
8157539,5,B000KJU0YW,"This movie is very entertaining.  Alexis Arquette and Omar Alexis are great as the 2 leads, very funny and camp.  Sure the quality of the film isn't the best but its an independent movie what do you expect?  They didn't have alot of money to make it. I love this movie and highly reccomend it.....a lot of fun!",1147737600,2,310,4.310344827586207
