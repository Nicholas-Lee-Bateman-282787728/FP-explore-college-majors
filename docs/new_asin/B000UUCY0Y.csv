This is motorcycle racing in it's purest form. Wild speeds on closed public roads. At the Isle of Mann there is no run out like on a moto GP course, low side here and there is no airfence at the end of your slide. Hey, don't get me wrong I love watching GP racing and it's no walk in the park, this is just a different breed of cat.

The commentary is a hoot! The announcers truly love the sport. Thier easy style lends a nice balance to the knife edge competition and danger. I really liked the casual aplomb of their quips.

2007 being the 100th anniversary of this event made this year and this review historically significant. There are some good special features highlighting the original bikes with great footage of a wide variety of machines from the past. On board camera shots put video games to shame.

I was a little confused about the compatibility of these discs with my DVD player. This item is listed as ""non DVD"". NTSC is the North American format and they worked fine in my player.

Motorcycles as life blood. Fever pitch at the Isle of Mann. Life on the edge. Kick ass poetry in motion!",1195344000,9,1237,4.384279475982533
