8134374,5,B000GTDX2M,"An overlooked gem from the Disney film vaults.  First broadcast on May 22, 1977, this film about a young woman's hopes of becoming a horse racing jockey creates the story that was just made for ""The Wonderful World of Disney.""  Original story was written by legendary Disney story man, James Algar.  The 48 minute film was shot on location in Simi Valley (not far from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library).  The Executive Producer of the film was Ron Miller.

Thankfully, this great little film hasn't been lost and survives for another generation to enjoy.  Nicely preserved and the film stock has held up well for this DVD presentation.",1386547200,3,641,4.888888888888889

The horse is the story is named Woodhill, and he is beautiful but very difficult to work with. He has a bad reputation for hurting his own riders.
