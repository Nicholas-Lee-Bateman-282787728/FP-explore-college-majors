1276198,3,B00003CXJ1,Owen Wilson provides some good laughs. Jackie Chan has good moments. His best scene is getting high on the peace pipe and laughing like Ichabod Crane if you know what I mean. The fights are bottom of the barrel but the chemistry of the film's two stars somewhat salvage this film. The film is punctuated by great small roles. If you can accept this film as a buddy picture with nothing else of note to add to the proceedings then this film is almost a winner.,1469923200,,459,4.348837209302325

1276352,4,B00003CXJ1,"Shanghai noon is a classic Jackie Chan movie in my opinion. It was made at a time when he had recently been introduced to US audiences and was looking for something a little more American-plot driven and mainstream. Enter Owen Wilson and a script that allows Jackie Chan to bring his signature- style, incredible kung fu and comedy in a more American style, buddy cop film.
  Owen Wilson plays a cowboy outlaw who can't shoot straight to save his life (unless it's  a true miracle-but I don't want to spoil anything), but he has the brains and a big heart. Jackie Chan plays an Imperial guard whom practically begs to take the assignment of going to the US to bring back the Princess. The two meet in an unexpected way, and, well, you have to watch it to see the rest. The two have chemistry, which is not a surprise considering their personalities, and the film really helps bring out Jackie Chan's comedic style with a recognizable voice, face and the on-screen persona that is so well played my Owen Wilson. A little something new combined with something that American audiences are more used to seeing. It's a great idea and one that audiences gave their  thumbs up to as well, being so successful they went on to make Shanghai Knights which was released just three years later.
  This movie pays homage to the wild west and American westerns while introducing a little of Asian history in the US and a hint of Chinese culture, too. I would suggest renting or buying it if you're a fan of Owen Wilson or Jackie Chan. It doesn't feature as many fight scenes as some of his other movies but the ones that are in there will make you smile. We watched it through Amazon  on-demand using our TiVo  Premiere and it worked great. No need to download this one as it streamed up in HD pretty quickly, a very nice surprise. Grab your PC, Mac or TV remote and a movie snack and we will see you in OK corral At high noon, Shaghai Noon... to say ""howdy, partner."" Enjoy the show!",1461024000,,1970,4.4527777777777775

1276713,5,B00003CXJ1,"Just the right mix of action and comedy. My second time watching it, and I still laughed at all the fun parts. Owen Wilson is a little off sometimes because of the writing, I think. But these two are great together, and some of Jackie Chan's best climbing scenes are in this movie. Lucy Liu is good as well, though I would have liked to have seen more. When she starts fighting the bad guy, it's cool, but it doesn't last long enough. Given that the Native American woman saves Jackie and Owen all the time, I think the writers/directors missed a chance to have Lucy Liu save herself, and just have Jackie fight the people from his own monastery. Oh well, still a great movie.",1427414400,,676,4.373015873015873

1276809,5,B00003CXJ1,"Princess Pei-Pei, to escape an arranged marriage, runs away to America, not realizing the American tutor who helps her is actually kidnapping her for her father's old enemy. The Imperial guards sent after her with the ransom includes one very mediocre Chon Wang who has worshipped her from afar. When the train he and the others are on is robbed, the Great Adventure begins with Chon ending up as the Shanghai Kid, an outlaw the likes of which the West has never before seen.

This is a fun movie full of Jackie Chan feats  to delight the eye and boggle the mind.  Owen Wilson is great as the totally inept braggart of a bankrobber who is basically good at heart, and the two make a great enough team to film a sequel to this story.  There are cliches galore, little in-jokes about Westerns, etc., through the characters names, snarky remarks, and even posters on the sides of barns. It's fast-paced and funny, with plenty of recognizable faces who've since become more recognizable in TV series.  Lucy Liu is lovely and delicate-looking as Pei-Pei but shows a China doll isn't necessarily as fragile as she appears, in her own fight scenes.  The one in the bell tower of the Mission is especially exciting.

This movie was filmed in the Forbidden City and Canada and the scenery, especially the far-off view of the snow-covered mountains, is especially beautiful.",1417132800,,1364,4.754237288135593

It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title ""Shanghai Noon"" is a comical take on ""High Noon"" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's ""The Mummy."" It's not as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it's better than its sequels.

Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is really funny, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.

Back in the late 90's, early 00's when his style of comedic martial arts and entertainingly staged action sequences littered the movie theaters.  Back when his broken English was mocked by his American co-stars.  Back when every movie he starred in revolved around a stolen Princess (or some sort of important female).  Yes, `Shanghai Noon' differs very little from other Chan vehicles like `Rush Hour'.  The gags are similar; the premise seems like just another variation of the same, except instead of Chris Tucker's arrogant hilarity we have Owen Wilson pandering his breed of comedy.  I prefer Chris Tucker, by a country mile (never understood the fascination with the Owen brothers, despite occasionally appreciating their `talent').  In the end, `Shanghai Noon' feels like a wasted opportunity.  Sure, it switches up the local, but there is nothing here that we haven't seen before.

It also introduced a much wider English-speaking audience to the charm and talents of Asian star Jackie Chan, who now is well-known everywhere.

This is considered one of Chan's better films and the setting certainly is different than normal for him: the American Old West. Good action scenes, some solid humor, fun characters and nice cinematography are all the pluses. Chan speaks English so there is no need for dubbing, either.

The only ""minus"" I found was the final action scene going on too long, but that's typical of modern action films. All in all, this is a very entertaining movie. Owen Wlson and Lucy Liu also are two big reasons this film became so popular.",1240444800,,838,4.655405405405405

I've watched both actors (especially Owen Wilson) in many movies since this one's release in 2000, but I can hardly say they've improved as their comedic stylings were as solid then as they remain today.

Jackie's sidekick in Shanghai Noon is a great comedian.  He has a look and a voice quality that is very unique.  Perfect casting for the part.  The jail house scene between the two is priceless.

I also really like the music right from the beginning.  The music sets the mood and really supports the action.

1277486,4,B00003CXJ1,"A tagline for this film is: ""Western Action, Eastern Flavor. Won Ton Of Adventure"" Indeed, Shanghai Noon is a Won Ton of adventure that is absolutely entertaining and just fantastically funny.

Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are one dynamite team. They have fantastic chemistry that gives hilarious moments and wonderfull one liners.
They both give there own twist to the film: Chan, who is well known for doing his own stunts and action has once again succeded in making some jawdropping fightscenes mixed with nice Chan humor. Expect great fightmoments that have been perfectly choreographed by Chan himself and well captured on camera by director Tom Dey.
Now Owen Wilson is aboslutely hilarious with his performace as the relaxed cowboy Roy O'bannon. The way he talks, moves and portrays his character is of great entertainment value and helps the film alot. Then there is the way he deals with Chan's Character Chon Wang which is just pure funny.

The movie itself, looking at the lighting, sets, camerawork, locations and music is well produced and made. The film gives a nice western feeling. It actually has all the elements you expect in a western: the classic duals, gun shooting, indians, horseriding, great wide landscapes, sunsets, salones, even the vultures are present. In other words, a true treat for western fans. Oh, another word to those true western fans: look and listen closely, you will see and hear a lot of references to those old classic western from the Sergio Leone era. Defenitly fun to see.

Well now: the action, the comedy, Chan and Wilson, it's all a perfect mix for some nice movie entertainment at any time of the week. Nice popcorn fun where you can forget your worries for a moment and just simply enjoy.
Characters to love, action and humor to enjoy: you will be wanting more, and thats when you have to take a look at the equally succesful sequel: Shanghai Knights.
Like Roy O'bannon says himself in the film: ""That's beautiful."" And it just is. Experience the reason why the movies where invented and made for in the first place a long time ago: entertainment.",1161388800,,2098,4.854748603351955

The thin story has Chan playing a woefully incompetent and disobediant Chinese Imperial Palace Guard demanding he help bring back the Emperor's daughter, Princess Pei-Pei (Lucy Liu) whose run off to America.  In short course, Chan meets a bumbling gang of bandits led by the always hyper relaxed Owen Wilson.  Before long, the two are engaging in bar brawls and visting the ladies of the evening at the local cathouse.  Meanwhile, Princess Pei-Pei has ended up in human bondage - enslaved to a former Imperial Palace Guard who has big, diabolical plans for her.

Don't expect anything more than fun, fantastic action sequences and slick comedic set-ups and this movie will grow on you.  It's not the typical western, nor is it the typical martial arts eastern.  It's a great hybrid of both and I can definitely see why a sequel followed.",1155168000,,1158,4.745

Character actor Xander Berkeley is very good too as the no good sheriff, Nathaniel Van Cleef (Notice the play on western actor Lee van Cleef's name).  The anachronistic referrals to pop culture such as John Wayne and Wyatt Earp being terrible cowboy names; Wilson calling Chan Dr. No in one sequence; and the reference to the likelihood of Chinese food catching on in the West are all fun sequences.

Jackie Chan's martial arts exhibitions are mesmerizing as always, and Owen Wilson is great as the goofy counterpoint to Chan's earnest character.

1277581,4,B00003CXJ1,"It's a film like this that I love. It had me on the ground laughing out loud and intensely captivated by the cool and crazy action sequences. Jackie Chan does what he does best, playing a martial arts master, and Owen Wilson does what he does best, just being a laid back type of guy. From the moment you first meet Wilson, even though he's robbing a train, you can sense his laid-back style.

Jackie's character, of course, is entirely serious. He has to rescue a Chinese princess who has been kidnapped and he meets up with Wilson along the way (doesn't at all sound like Rush Hour). Throw in some mortal enemies and there you have it. Oh, and this all takes place in the Wild West. I thought that the plot was well thought out, but at times it rushed things. There is almost no transition from the end of the middle to the end of the movie.

Owen Wilson alone is hilarious but he works best when he's teamed up with someone else (See Starsky and Hutch). There is definitely great chemistry between him and Jackie. They play off of each other very well but don't get annoying either. One hilarious scene involves them stuck in a jail cell together. This is when they first really get to know each other and Owen introduces Jackie to his laid back style. They help each other break out, and from then on they are partners. There are some good montages of Owen introducing Jackie to the ways of the west.

But everything isn't always peachy between the two partners. They have their disagreements, and well, they tend to lead to some funny situations. Their final feud is perhaps a little too predictable, but the comedy makes up for it.

I'd definitely recommend this film. Jackie Chan's fighting is, as usually, amazing. He takes on both Cowboys and Indians and uses everything in the West to his advantage. There is a rather long scene involving him attacking multiple people with a horseshoe attached to a rope. They really did a great job of keeping a good balance of both action and comedy. Owen Wilson has the ability to laugh at anything and make the audience laugh at everything. This is by far one of the best action comedies out there.",1090540800,,2146,4.494871794871795

That's about all, though. Owen Wilson's wide-eyed naivete was over-used, and Chan's athleticism and physical comedy were under-used. The plot was adequate to keep the characters moving and to alternate between bad guys every now and then. Still, it's not the kind of movie that will keep you up late with its deep philosophy - or even with its bad puns.
Perhaps the funniest scene is the bathtub drink-off (no nudity, lots of bubbles). On the second thought, maybe it was the bloopers during the final credits.

1277666,4,B00003CXJ1,"Pairing Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson together may seem the most unlikely thing to do since color televisions were first invented. But both of these actors are funny, in one way or another--Chan through his innocence, Wilson through his sarcastic, snide remarks. Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writer--he shares writing credits on such films as ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""
Chan, on the other hand, is a better martial arts master than Jet Li and a more likable character actor than Chow Yun Fat (whose disastrous film ""Bulletproof Monk"" made me want to split his head open to prevent him from ever making another American mainstream motion picture ever again).
In ""Shanghai Noon,"" Chan plays Chon Wang, a 19th century Chinese martial arts master who ventures out to Nevada in order to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), whose name is misused by Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) on at last one occasion.
After Chon Wang (mistakenly pronounced ""John Wayne"") meets up with Roy, the two decide to form an alliance and rescue the princess -- one for honor, the other for loads of money awaiting them upon her safe arrival back home in Imperial China's Forbidden City.
Roy is a lousy wannabe cowboy who used to stage clumsy train robberies along with his band of thieves, who betrayed him and left him for dead. He offers his help to Wang, and tries to play it cool, but he can't -- after all, he's not a very convincing cowboy. But, as the smarmy wisecracking sidekicks always are, O'Bannon just wants money. But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger, he realizes that money isn't everything.
Sounds routine, doesn't it? Well, it is, to a certain extent. But it succeeds due to a fine cast -- Chan and Wilson are extraordinarily good together; so good, in fact, that Chris Tucker is just a forgotten memory by the time that the film is over.
It's a classic spin on the Old West formula; what ""The Princess Bride"" or ""Shrek"" did for fairy tales, ""Shanghai Noon"" does for Westerns. All the old cliches are poked fun at in a light way. And as great as Chan is, and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas, Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan.
Chan's martial arts are usually the highlights of these films, but in this he proves he can do more than just kick -- he can be funny. Well, okay, he proved that in ""Rush Hour"" (1998), but I like this better.
The jokes in ""Shanghai Noon"" aren't ""great,"" but I laughed a lot at this film. It's smarter than one might think, and is certainly one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite some time. Probably years. I wasn't expecting much (especially because I wasn't an enormous fan of the sequel--see below), but if fun could be rated on a scale of 1 - 10, this would be an 11.
I give this film nothing more than four out of five stars because it's not a great film on all critical levels. But it's certainly fun--likely more fun than any film you'll see for quite some time--and for that it will soon be earning a place in my sacred DVD collection.
I must say that I wasn't a huge fan of ""Shanghai Knights,"" the sequel to ""Shanghai Noon,"" which involved Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon venturing to England in order to save Wang's sister.

Owen Wilson is so charming as the hapless but innocent crook Roy O'Bannon who teams up Jackie Chan's Chong Wang/John Wayne to put an evil Sheriff out of business, rescue a Princess and defeat some stock Chinese Bad Guy. It's all harmless stuff with some neat fight scenes that never get too violent and a gleefully light-hearted sense of humor.

1277672,5,B00003CXJ1,"This is a movie that the whole family likes. And the true test is that we have watched it 20 times, and there is only one scene we skip!
This is the story of an imperial guard, Chong Wang, pronounced John Wayne, played by Jackie Chan, who is out to rescue the imperial princess.  She has been kidnapped and is being ransomed for gold.  He meets and ultimately teams up with a train robber named Roy OBannon, his outlaw name.  Roys live has been one of robbing trains and spending all the money in brothels.  Meeting Chong gives Roys life a purpous that it had always lacked.  Roys joins Chong in his noble quest and the journey is tremendous fun for the viewer.
For many of us, this is the movie that introduced us to Owen Wilson.  Owen plays a semi-compitent non stop jabber mouth, which plays well with the laconic Chan.
The fight scenes with Chan are amazing and inventive, as we have come to expect from a Jackie Chan movie.  One wonders how long he can keep doing his own stunts.  When he has to slow down, his creative mind, acting ability and big grin should carry him nicely for a long time.

1277762,5,B00003CXJ1,"""Shanghai Noon"" is a five star film when judged by its enjoyability and not by more presumptuous artistic standards.  But in a world were so many movies fail big time and fall short of their potential there is ample reason to celebrate a fun movie like this one.  Besides, when it comes to martial arts films it is clear to me that Jackie Chan is a perfect combination of the athleticism of Gene Kelly with the ability of Fred Astaire to work with whatever is laying about the location.  Seriously, think about it; Chan doing a fight sequence with elk antlers just like Astaire dancing with a hat rack.
The point of the plot is to get Jackie Chan's character, Chon Wang, into the Wild West of the Nevada frontier in 1881.  Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Lui) of the Imperial Court becomes the victim of a kidnapping plot and is taken to the United States.  Three warriors are sent to deliver the ransom, along with a royal interpreter; Chon Wang tags along to carry the baggage.  Unfortunately the train on which the Chinese are traveling is the target of wannabee outlaw Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and his inept gang.  The two become partners in rescuing the princess, although Roy is more interested in the gold.  Consequently the plot is a model of predictability but serves its purpose of getting us from one amazing fight sequence to the next.
The pairing of Chan and Wilson is similar to that of Chan and Chris Tucker in the ""Rush Hour"" movies, contrasting Chan's halting English with an ultra-verbal co-star.  But there is a significant difference in that Wilson is more low keyed in his verbosity, making for what I think is a better contrast.  The point that I knew this movie was really going to work was when Chon comes across Roy buried up to his neck in the sand.  Instead of digging Roy out of the hole, Chon simply gives him a pair of chopsticks and suggests Roy dig himself out.  Of course, Roy does, which is important because it gives the character credibility for holding his own, at least on some level, with Chon, which he certainly does in their first fight scene together.  More importantly, they are both fish out of water when it comes to the Wild West.
Jackie Chan's creativity in fight sequences is astounding and setting the action in a Western gives it an added vitality.  However, Chan also has an opportunity to do some ""real"" acting in this film with several early scenes that require emotional responses.  Across the board this may well be Chan's best performance.  There are also references to at least two dozen westerns, from the attempt to blow open a safe on a train from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" to a villain being named Van Cleef just liked the actor who played the ""bad"" guy in ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.""  These assorted homages, nudges, and winks to past westerns is just part of the general sense of joy that permeates this film (and give you something to do when you watch the film a second time).  Shanghai Noon is just a fun film that avoids insulting the intelligence of its audience.  We need more movies like this one (which explains the recent sequel).",1049673600,,3114,4.568345323741007

Noon follows the formula without a hitch, which will be a godsend to some, but total boredom for others.  Perhaps a better way of determining your enjoyment of the movie is asking yourself whether or not you find Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan funny guys.  Personally, I've always found Wilson irritating, but Chan has had his moments, even if most of them were back in Hong Kong.  Their pairing leads to maybe two decent laughs, both during that jailbreak scene, which is another example of good set-up that ends with a botched gag.
The story is nothing to write about, really, just something about a kidnapped princess and the mismatched partners who have to save her.  There are a few obligatory things to point out.  Lucy Lui's Princess Pei Pei, in spite of all her ""strong"" moments as a caring ruler, is little more than a damsel in distress.  Just when she gets the opportunity to kick ... at the end by all her lonesome, she needs to be saved yet again.  And does anyone else find it annoying it's her impetuousness that starts this whole mess in the first place?  Then there's the Indian girl, played by Brandon Merrill, who serves no other purpose than to help out our heroes simply because the screenwriters can't think of any other way to resolve a cliffhanger.
The finale gets dragged in syrupy sentimentality, with that whole ""do the right thing"" angle that can be touching when delivered well, but not here.  As much as I like law-abiding citizens, it seems rather odd and not entirely believable Wilson's rowdy cowboy character would simply turn into a man of ""honor"" so abruptly.  And when you think about it, the Chan/Wilson pairing doesn't add up to much when you realize the former doesn't even trust the latter until the last five minutes.  Their arguments over greed and honor are numerous, repetitive, taken way too seriously and weigh the whole movie down.
On a semi-bright side, Chan's moves are still impressive, so you can expect a few somewhat enjoyable fight scenes.  Unfortunately, Chan's elaborate costumes tend to obscure his moves, which sort of defeats the whole purpose of these action sequences (the Blade series suffered from a similar flaw, as Snipes' character rarely fought without his huge, overflowing coat on).  To sum it up, Shanghai Noon is pretty much second-rate on all counts as a buddy picture, you'd be better off sticking with any of the Lethal Weapons or Die Hard: With a Vengeance.",1041292800,,2638,4.769230769230769

1277770,5,B00003CXJ1,"This has got to be Jackie's best movie so far! Even better than Rush Hour. Yes, I am a Jack Chan fan. Not a fan of Martial Arts movies in general, but Jackie always plays such a nice, innocent guy, and his movies are always so full of comedy and hilarious fighting action, that it's hard not to become a loyal Chan fan. Shanghai Noon is no exception, and the chemistry between Jackie and the always hilarious Owen Wilson is wonderful! The plot is simple, but works great for the comedy and fighting sequences that are the real focus here. Jackie plays Chon Wang, a misfit member of the Chinese Royal Guard. When the Princess runs away to America to avoid marrying a less than charming suitor, Chon manages to join the rescue party. But while riding across the old west aboard a train, the men experience a hold-up, and Chon's uncle is unfortunately killed. Chasing after the villains, Chon is quickly seperated from his companions and alone in the unfriendly and wild, old west. He stumbles upon a tribe of Sioux Indians, and after a night of puffing on the peace pipe, wakes up with a beautiful new wife that he really doesn't want. Not long after that, he makes friends with the laid-back, talkative, and bumbling outlaw-wannabe, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Roy proceeds to teach the humorless Chon the ways of the west, but is the worst teacher anyone could possibly hope to team up with. The laughs flow continuously, as Roy and Chon try to survive against the likes of Marshall Nathan Van Cleef, the evil Lo Fong, and Crazy Wallace, the train robbing Texan, all the while determined to rescue the Chinese Princess from her new captors.
  The movie is typically sweet comedy from kickster Jackie Chan and smooth talker Owen Wilson, backed by a great soundtrack of modern cowboy songs like ""I Wanna Be A Cowboy,"" and ""Back In the Saddle Again."" The DVD has a nice pile of extras too.  You just can't go wrong by picking this one up if you like a good laugh and a sweet story with a feel-good ending.",1029801600,,2002,4.555555555555555
1277840,4,B00003CXJ1,"In Short:
Pros
1: Jackie Chan has the perfect part in this movie, very believable role for him.
2: Pretty clean humor you could watch it with the family (even the Indian peace pipe scene does not expressly state it's marijuana).
3: Excellant chemistry between Chan and Wilson.
4: Yes there are fight scenes here but not much blood at all.
Pro or Con:
1: There are fewer stunts and fight scenes than in some other Chan movies and they tend to be more in line with what you see in other movies at times.  For some this is a good thing for others not but it's still got some good action sequences to go with the comedy.
Cons
Nothing significant really.
I'm a fan of Jackie Chan's so it's no wonder that I liked this but I also think it is one of his better movies.
It's a pretty good take on a standard plotline involving the good guys saving the princess and works very well as a vehicle for the humor and stunts we get with most any Chan movie. Chan and Wilson have good on screen chemistry and create an endearing image of a likeable cowboy want-a-be and a Chinese immigrant come from the emperors court to save his princess.
I thought the scene where Chan is befriended by a local Indian tribe after saving one of the chiefs daughters was one of the highlights but I do kind of wonder what an Indian would make of it (it involves Marijuana and some interesting conversation subtitles). Man Who Fights In Dress is instantly liked by the Indians even though no one can understand him.
Owen Wilson's character is a contemporary take on the American cowboy and old west opportunist. He equals Chan on the humor side perhaps but not on the stunt end, that is Jackie's show through and through. The standard out takes and bloopers are at the end but are shorter than I've seen on other Chan films, whether there was fewer of them or what I don't know. It's a very small part of the product of course that does not detract from the film.
I would not say this is Chan's best movie for stunts necessarily and the fighting choreography has been better in other pictures. What I rate this film so highly for is the overall pace of it and the flow of the movie. This is one of those movies that seem to fly past even though it is in fact a standard length picture leaving you wishing there was more.
It's really very good in my opinion.",1029110400,,2325,4.320366132723112
1277841,4,B00003CXJ1,"This is a great movie if your not looking for an in depth story line and character development.  It's basically another Jackie Chan action movie but it has a twist, this time Jackie's in the old west.  The action is wonderful (vintage Jackie Chan) and the comedy is also vintage Jackie so if your a Jackie Chan fan then you should find this movie entertaining.
Owen Wilson also does a great job as the outlaw wanna be in this movie.  Wilson has a different comedical air to him which I happen to enjoy but which isn't for everyone.  If you liked him in Meet the Parents then you'll like him in this as well, basically the same type of comedy with a different roll.
Lucy Liu's character really doesn't add anything to this movie.  She plays the princess kidnapped from China and brought to America which spawns Jackie coming to save her.  Although her part is crucial within the story it really is secondary and really doesn't add anything or allow Liu to shine.
Basically if your a Jackie Chan fan or an Owen Wilson fan you won't be disappointed with this film.  It adds originality to Jackie's fight scenes and gives you his classic comedy combined with Wilson's unique style of comedy.  It's deffinately worth the money!",1023667200,,1222,4.573394495412844
1277842,5,B00003CXJ1,"I had heard of ""Shanghai Noon"" when it had first come out, but didn't have much interest in it. But a few weeks ago I decided to try it out once and found it thoroughly entertaining!
Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) decides to leave the Forbidden City of China to go off to America. But when she arrives in Carson City with her English teacher, she realizes she has been in fact kidnapped, master minded by a traitor, Lo Fong (Roger Yuan). It's up to the Chinese Imperial Guards to save her. One Imperial Guard, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is separated from his fellow mates and is stuck in the West without a clue where Carson City is! He ties up with Indians for a while, marrying the beautiful Indian princess, Falling Leaves (Brandon Merrill) then gradually teams up with 'not quite your average outlaw' Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). With the Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley) on their tale, will they ever save the princess?
PLOT: The plot of the story is average if not very original. But the acting, action, and humor makes ""Shanghai Noon"" to be a five-star great movie!
ACTING: Though most people may not believe it, this is my first Jackie Chan movie to watch. Throughout the whole movie he has this sort of wise yet innocent manner about it since he has no clue how to act in the west. Lucy Liu does not come out that much in the movie yet she has her moments. She's so regal that she's great for the part of the princess in captive. Brandon Merrill, a real-life rodeo champion, is very cool as another princess with lots of guts, getting Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson out of trouble. But I must say, Owen Wilson of Roy O'Bannon steals the whole film. He's just so into his part that you can't believe he's only acting!
ACTION: As all Jackie Chan movies are, ""Shanghai Noon"" is action packed. Because it's a movie how 'East meets West', it has both kung fu and gun fighting. Chan gets to use antlers, a horshoe whip, his pony-tail, and other ingenious weapons while the character of Roy gets to use his 'skills?' as a gunfighter. Lots of great scenes but my favorites are: the bar fight scene, the two Roy O'Bannon versus the Marshall 'stand-offs', and Jackie Chan versus Lo Fong.
HUMOR: The whole movie is filled with lots of one-liners you just naturally memorize and subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) humor. Most of the humor is given off to perfection by Owen Wilson though Jackie Chan has his moments. Here are a few of my favorite lines:
Roy O'Bannon: My name's Roy O'Bannon.
Chon Wang: Chon Wang.
Roy O'Bannon: ""John Wayne""? That's a terrible cowboy name! That's not going to work. And neither is the ponytail.
Roy O'Bannon: We're men, not pinatas!
Roy O'Bannon: On the count of three. 1... 2... 2 1/2... 2 and 7/8... 3!
Roy O'Bannon: I may not know karate, but I know crazy.
And basically the whole movie is simply hilarious. There's some bloopers at the end of th movie that is just funny! I especially love the one when Jackie Chan is 'fixing' Owen Wilson's shoulder! The music is very cool also, not at all the normal 'western type' of music you would listen to in a typical western movie, but of course, ""Shanghai Noon"" is NOT a typical western movie. I highly recommend it for anyone how wants a good laugh and some great action/adventure.
PG-13 RATING: The movie is rated PG-13 because of language and some scenes. Best for older teenagers and adults.",1023494400,,3375,4.534426229508196
1277843,4,B00003CXJ1,"I was prepared to dislike Shanghai Noon. One genre I don't like because I don't get it is martial arts. Like professional wrestling, these movies always seem so fake to me, even when they do star Jackie Chan, who admittedly is a good actor. Another type of film I am not often keen on is the western. Shanghai Noon takes place in the wild West of the late 19th Century and contains a lot of kung fu madness. Unexpectedly, I thoroughly enjoyed the picture, for it is, first and foremost, a comedy on the order of Blazing Saddles and Cat Ballou.
The story opens in China's forbidden city, where Chon Wang [Jackie Chan] is one of the palace guards. He knows Princes Pei Pei is unhappy because she is being forced to marry a most unpleasant nobleman. He overhears her talking to a visiting American, who says he can smuggle her to freedom in America. Chon tries to stop this plan, but the princess is determined and soon leaves. It turns out that the American is working with a former imperial guard. A ransom letter appears. If 100,000 pieces of gold isn't delivered to Carson City, Nevada in two months, it says, the princess is history. Chon talks the emperor into letting him go with the guards delivering the gold. This group is in for some major culture shock and has a hard time even finding Nevada. Along the way, the train they are on is robbed by a gang lead by a hilariously inept cowboy named Roy O'Bannon [Owen Wilson]. At this point Chon is separated from the other Chinese. Chon and Roy's paths keep intersecting, and a grudging alliance develops. Roy is more than willing to help find a beautiful princess and a chest full of gold. Somewhere in all this, Chon manages to get captured by Indians, who marry him off to one of their own princesses.
The plot is silly, but that is often an element of comedy. When the absurdity of it all works, as it does in Shanghai Noon, the results are funny. The trick is to play it with a wink and a nod, letting the audience know that nothing is to be taken seriously. Chan and Wilson pull this off masterfully. Chan gleefully makes fun of himself, parodying all the kung fu roles which made him famous. Wilson has brilliant comic timing.
This is a surprisingly adult comedy, one that is more rowdy than risque. One of the funniest scenes involves the pair having a drinking contest while sitting in metal bathtubs in a house of ill repute. Another segment has Chon smoking a peace pipe with the Indians. What they are smoking is definitely not tobacco.
I suppose some of Chan's fans were disappointed because the level of violence is so low. There are several big fights that show off his skills, but these are presented in a way more akin to the westerns of old than to the modern gore fest. I think the choice to do this made Shanghai Noon much more enjoyable because it keeps reality from ever rearing its ugly head.",1016409600,,2868,4.4751908396946565
1277844,3,B00003CXJ1,"'Shanghai Noon' offers two versions of Chinese hierarchical communities - the Imperial Family and their vassals in the Forbidden City; and Lo Fong's slave colony in Carson City.  It is between these negative extremes of Chinese stereotypes; unwavering, robotic devotion, submission and identity-suppression; ruthless Fu-Manchu-like sadism - that Jackie Chan must negotiate, while still retaining those positive Chinese characteristics - humour, loyalty, friendship, adaptability, style and skill (especially, of course, martial arts).  And, what is this miraculous Third Way?  Why, the American Way, of course!  Chan is the classic American immigrant who leaves a repressive, hierarchical autocracy, learns the English language and American, 'democratic' manners, traverses the continent, works hard, bringing native skill to the land, rising to a position of respectability and power in the community, having once been perceived as 'low', even 'bad'.  In Chan's case, it is the move from the unthinking execution of arbitrary orders, to the exercise of free will that propels his narrative.  He is not alone - this is probably the most ethnically diverse Western in Hollywood, with Chinese, Irish and Indians as the norm against which clash the malevolent, mercenary WASPS.  Jackie Chan becomes John Wayne.  The comedy makes much predictable fun of culture clashes.  And yet there is a disturbing, strangely ritualistic sequence, where, in their first appearance, the Indians (in this case, Crow) are as whooping, barbaric and murderous, as deprived of voice or inner life, as in any John Ford Western.
I found 'Noon' to be a bit disappointing, especially when compared to 'Rush Hour', Chan's breakthrough American film (in fact, that movie's plot - Chinaman travels to America to rescue the abducted daughter of an important personage; the victim even has a few chop socky skills of her own - is simply regurgitated and transplanted out West).  Chan and Owen Wilson are engaging enough individually, but they don't have the same chemistry Chan had with Chris Tucker, largely because the script isn't awfully funny.  The set-pieces are disappointingly perfunctory, and even the elaborate bell-tower denouement (like 'Rush Hour', Jackie Chan films must climax on a high) is more spectacular than exciting or inventive.  There is no engagement with the West as either a lived-in historical place, as an important cultural site, or as settings for innumerable Westerns - cliches from the latter are invoked, but the film-makers seem to think centring them on a Chinaman stops them being cliches.
I know it's 'only' an action-comedy, but look, for instance, at Leone's 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly', another unlikely double act that polemically engaged with cultural and cinematic myths of the West, but also provided literally explosive set-pieces and consistently strong comedy.",1013558400,,2880,5.447191011235955
1277845,4,B00003CXJ1,"My first impression of this film was another Jackie Chan movie. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy his stunts and his special talent; it's just I think he needs a better story and script to make a good movie. Makeing a Western sounded kind of far fetched. I wsn't going to rent this movie at first, but when I saw that owen Wilson was in it, who was hilarious in Meet THe Parents, I picked this one up. I thought this movie was yet again meaning less not that good of a plot, or if you want to look at the plot of friendship than I guess that was acceptable. It was a riot, Owen Wilson almost every word he said made me laugh. Jackie's serious role made me laugh because he was totally an opposite from Owen, witch made this even more funnier. A great movie.

Jackie certainly gets good marks in my books, but the real star of Shanghai Noon is Owen Wilson who proves with a fantastic chemistry-filled and swashbuckling attitude that he can go above and beyond The Haunting. The script of Shanghai Noon is very cool, with neat one-liners and plenty of interesting and likeable characters. The photography is amazing, with the stunning western backdrops and brilliantly filmed fight sequences. Speaking of those, there are some very good fight sequences, but some may argue it is not up to Chan's standards. The film also drags on for too long near the end.

Every character in this film, except the two princesses (Chinese and Native American), is mediocre. However, in their element they take on Superman-like qualities, especially during the martial arts sequences.
Chan plays a member of the Chinese Imperial Guard, whose mission in coming to the American Wild West during the latter half of the 1800s, is to rescue a princess and return her to China. After the second martial arts sequence, he becomes an adopted member of a Native American tribe, and the ""husband"" of the stunningly beautiful (and wholesome-looking) daughter of the chief. She ends up bailing him out of several desperate situations. She also ends up paired with the other male lead at the end of the film.
He is a marginally competent train robber named Roy O'Bannon, whose main interest isn't the money, but the women the money buys, and buy them he does. O'Bannon is really a nice guy once we overlook the armed robbery. (Will the young Native American princess make him an honest man?)
Chan's schticks include placing his martial arts skills in impossible contexts, foiling the bad guys, and exploiting his heavy Chinese accent for our entertainment. Much as I hesitate to admit it, it works. The film is as enjoyable as it is light, and it is light as a feather.

Chan and Owen Wilson work well as a team, and they inject something extra into what is otherwise a rather disjointed story, keeping the whole enterprise from sinking below average. But that still leaves it firmly in the realm of film mrdiocrity. Finally, there are the martial arts sequences.

Although the fight/action scenes are surprising, much of the humor is expected; it has been done enough times that you see it coming (like the scene where they dynamite the safe...I remember seeing this in ""The Outlaw"" with Kirk Douglas and a young Arnold Schwarzenegger).

Action-wise it will probably disappoint die hard Jackie fan(atic)s (who may not care that Jackie IS 47 and is perhaps investigating other ways of making action movies which DON'T involve dangerous stunts - after all, he has escaped death a number of times - he can't keep on being lucky forever!) If you approach this movie with this in mind and also realising it is a parody of all the best-loved western cliches - more a comedy than an action kung fu flick - then you will really enjoy it.  If you like this movie, then you will probably like his just-released DVD ""Accidental Spy"", which in a surprise switch shows a more sombre side of JC.  Again, a good story line, a reasonable amount of action, but not many stunts.  Anyway, ""Shanghai Noon"" DVD is a great buy with LOTS of bonus material, including deleted scenes.  Buy and enjoy!!",989712000,,1018,4.5
1278217,4,B00003CXJ1,"Shanghai Noon is by far the best Jackie Chan movie made in the US.  It is much more enjoyable than the over-rated Rush Hour.  For me a large part of that is because I find Owen Wilson to be much more entertaining and amiable than the grating human cartoon, Chris Tucker.  But even more than Tucker, the fight scenes are much closer to his Hong Kong films.  Close but still not quite there.  The action has all of Jackie's trademark acrobatics and fast editing.  It seems to be slowed down a bit from Rumble In The Bronx, Supercop or any of his other HK films though.
There is a great deal of chemistry between Jackie and Owen and a lot of that has to do with Jackie's Mr Nice Guy persona.  You can't help but feel he's everybody's friend.  The relationship of the two characters reminded me a lot of the Robert DeNiro/Charles Grodin relationship in Midnight Run.  Owen Wilson is the footloose rouge trying to get the stiff uptight Chan to relax and take life as it comes.  This is a fun buddy film that I would highly recommend.",989020800,,1028,4.363157894736842
1278218,4,B00003CXJ1,"I didn't like this Jackie Chan movie as much as I did his others. I found the fighting sequences much too short and not as thrilling. Chong, played by Jackie, accidently gets a wife, but she seemed to only be added to get Chong and Roy, (Owen Wilson) out of trouble at the last minute. However, I loved Owen Wislon's character, Roy, and he was great as Jackie's co-star. The comedy scenes were comical, espcially in the Indian village.  The plot was fairly good, but seemed to stop at some points. I got the feeling that Jackie just got the urge to do a western, and apart from the short fight scenes, an Indian wife that's only good for last minute rescues, and a couple other small things, Jackie did it surprising well. This was a good western comedy with great characters and acting, and although it doesn't seem to be up to Jackie's usual standards, I believe it's definatly worth seeing.",988243200,,893,4.512345679012346
1278219,5,B00003CXJ1,"True, I can say without hisitation that my favorite Jackie Chan films (Operation Condor, Who Am I, Project A, Police Story II) were under his Hong Kong contract, and not the one in the US.  Why?  It's because they have the awesome action that I have come to love about Jackie, mixed in with the charm.  If you compare the action scenes in Rush Hour to Legend of the Drunken Master, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's all about the action and the charm.
So yes, it is tragic that like Rush Hour, the action is kept simple and in small amount with very few stunts.  However, that is because it would cost a lot more to make the action scenes with thirty guys because of the Hollywood union.  Still, Jackie Chan still charms us, and makes us laugh as much as ever.  He here plays like an American actor, playing in a duet rather than center spotlight.  It's actually funny that Jackie is a better actor than most American stars.  However, Owen Wilson, the co-star, isn't an example of a weak American star, and you won't see what I mean unless you see some Leonardo Dicaprio.
Still, I like the character as much as the action, and when one fails, the other can still deliver a good movie.  This movie luckily focuses more on character development than in any other Jackie Chan movie, and the scene in which Jackie Chan finally raises to his feet, standing up agaist his Chinese owners, is a nice dramatic scene.  So yes, the nice amount of drama and the large amount of charm make up for the lack of action nicely, and then you don't even have to remind yourself that Hollywood has an excuse for the lack of action.

Why this movie didn't beat out Mission Impossible 2 is anyone's guess. What it lacks in an admittedly slender plot it makes up for in seeing the interaction between the laid back Owen Wilson & the stoic Jackie Chan.

1278272,5,B00003CXJ1,"Shanghai Noon is not one of the most spectacular action movies of Jackie Chen, but sure is one of the funniest.  Definitely worth seeing!
Despite of the fewer fighting scenes, Jackie Chen makes sure that you find every fight exciting, funny and real. (Of course! It's what Chen famous for!) He also added more diverse and cross-cultural jokes in, which he started doing since Rush Hour, make the movie funnier and more colorful.
Jackie Chen has a great cast team.  I can't think of anyone else could be better than Owen Wilson as the western partner of Jackie Chen.  Even the minor roles were well chosen, such as other Imperial guards and the Indians.  None of them makes any of the fighting seems fake.  The princess, on the other hand, could have been played better by someone else.  Lucy Liu is a good actress, but not a perfect candidate for this movie.  She was not funny enough and she speaks as if she is reading a script.  But this didn't effect the rating of the movie.  Over all, It's still a 5-star movie!
If you like Shanghai Noon, I would also recommend Once Upon China and America (with Jet Li), which is an earlier version of Shanghai Noon.

This film has all the usual elements of your typical western - the train robbery, bad guys turning on each other, saloon fights, shootouts etc.- but there is so much more. Along with the incredible Jackie Chan stunts, there are a number of scenes that are low key by comparison yet still a real joy (and laugh) to watch. Jackie Chan's experience with smoking the peace pipe with his future father-in-law, and Jackie's tub scene with Owen Wilson will test your ability to control your bladder.  And just in case the viewer doesn't catch the parallels with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, they even throw in a parody of the climactic shootout in Bolivia. The chemistry between Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson is apparent - they play off each other very well, and both characters realize at a gut level that they need each other to survive the rigors of the wild west.  For Jackie Chan it's a culture thing,whereas Owen Wilson seems to be a modern day New Ager not making sense of what is happening in his life, and still trying to find his niche.  This film is a real delight if you have the right mindset from the start - not a film to be taken seriously - just be ready to laugh.....a lot!",978307200,,1264,4.439655172413793
1278275,4,B00003CXJ1,"Since 1962, Jackie Chan has appeared in over 70 films in China, but until recently, he was virtually unknown to most U.S. audiences.  He has always been well known among those who enjoy martial arts and he is famous in those circles as the daredevil actor who does all his own stunts, some of which have been wildly dangerous.
However, Chan has always transcended his martial arts confinements, because besides being a talented martial arts athlete and stuntman, he is also an excellent comedian.  He is a master of physical comedy who has often been compared with Buster Keaton, whom he idolizes.  Now that he is learning to speak English, he is sure to become a big hit in the states.
""Shanghai Noon"" along with his smash hit ""Rush Hour"" (grossing $141 Million at the box office) have marked a turning point in his career.  The emphasis in both films is on Jackie Chan the comedian rather than Jackie Chan the stuntman and karate expert.  Sure, there are numerous scenes where he frenetically subdues a dozen or so thugs while climbing up walls and somersaulting through the air, but these action scenes are far sparser and less spectacular than in his Chinese films.
""Shanghai Noon"" didn't do as well at the box office as ""Rush Hour"" (still a respectable $55 Million), but it was actually the better film.  Chan is clearly the star in this film whereas he was overshadowed by Chris Tucker's outrageousness in ""Rush Hour"".  Despite its insubstantial story, a sendup of American Westerns with a side order of Chinese, this film is a good showcase for Chan's broad range of talents, especially his physical comedy.
Owen Wilson adds a wry note to the film by creating a bank robber that is as out of place in the American West as an Asian cowboy.  Wilson plays his part like a California surfer who has recently completed a set of Tony Robbins tapes.  He is so incongruous with his surroundings that almost everything he does is funny.
Though not a superlative film, ""Shanghai Noon"" is entertaining and funny and worth seeing for light comedic entertainment.  I rated it a 7/10.  It continues to establish Jackie Chan as a comedic force to be reckoned with, and from whom we are likely to get much great entertainment in the future.",977788800,,2231,4.709511568123394

The second thing on the video is previews. Here is the problem. I couldn't fast forward through them. I had to press the menu button to get past them.

He had a few good stunts, but they just  didn't seem to pack as much a punch (and the jump  from the train car to another looked totally fake,  like Jackie had assistance of some kind). This was  the first time that I had ever thought that.
Owen Wilson was consistent in his irritation. He & his  character really brought the film way down with horribly dull lines and acting. Never before had I had to fight to stay awake at a JC flick. Yet, it wasn't just his fault. There was also  the tepid storyline.
Like other reviews here, I agree that this is just a  ""Rush Hour"" rip-off set in the old-west minus the laughs.  The only chuckles came from the outtakes after the movie -  but even one of them I hated since it had Jackie say (I think) {profanity} after a mistake.
I was sorry that I had even rented this...another first.
Good things: breathtaking scenery & the camera work seemed  to be good; Jackie using the rope and horseshoe to defend himself was cool. But will that be enough for the fans? It wasn't for me.

What's the point of doing your own stunts if the use of close-ups, rapid cuts and slow-motion is going to make you look like every other action hero in a Hollywood movie?  I suppose the director, Tom Dey, can't be given all the blame for that since Jackie Chan's own production company was responsible for this film.  (Could it be that Jackie has reached a point where he feels that he needs some help from the camera?)

I saw it the movies, and have become a big Owen Wilson fan.  SO, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T LIKE HIM, DON'T BOTHER READING MY REVIEW..just kidding...it really was a cute film, i just love Owen.  His character has a dry sense of humor, not for all tastes, but if you are a fan of his work, you would love him in this.  He is both funny and charming.

Chan and Wilson meet up on a train that Wilson and his gang are trying to rob.  Chan is on his way to rescue the Princess PeiPei(a very quiet Lucy Liu, for once) from the bad guy. Roy and Chan Whang(or John Wayne, as Roy thought it was) become buddies and Roy teaches Chang how to be a cowboy(in his own way).  It is a buddy/comedy/western film.

1278372,4,B00003CXJ1,"It would be easy to write this off as ""Rush Hour Goes West,"" except that in every way, ""Shanghai Noon"" is the superior film: Jackie Chan's fish out of water character is more unique and further out of water, the action sequences are more spectacular, the premise (such as it is) is fairly unique and Owen Wilson is a better actor and comedian than Chris Tucker on his best day.
The premise -- Imperial Guard Jackie Chan goes from the Forbidden City to wild west Nevada to team up with easy going train robber Owen Wilson to rescue Western-minded Chinese princess Lucy Liu (who, for once, doesn't have any dominatrix parts to play in this movie) from eeeeeeeeeeeevil Chinese ""traitor"" and villainous marshal -- is basically just a frame to hook on pretty girls, some rather anachronistic seemingly ad-libbed dialogue by Wilson and, of course, one spectacular fight sequence after another.
The fights, alas, are fewer than in Chan's earlier films -- age and injury are catching up to him -- but they're still wildly inventive, with the best being a sequence in which he uses nearby saplings to fight off a horde of angry Crow.
Plot points are picked up and cast off as needed -- for instance, why the shotgun wedding bride switches her romantic allegience at the end isn't really explained (although the deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some of the gaps -- but ""Shanghai Noon"" isn't trying to be ""Lonesome Dove"" or even ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" It's fluff of the ""Young Guns"" tier, but it rises to the top of that subgenre, and is an immensely enjoyable and pleasant film, suitable for swashbuckling cowboys and not-too-bad desperadoes.",974505600,,1648,4.765734265734266

Nice simple story: a disillusioned Chinese princess (played surprisingly well by Lucy Liu) is tricked into going to America where she is held for ransom. 3 of the Imperial Guard are sent to rescue her and along tags Chan because he feels responsibile for the princesses predicament.
Along the way Chan meets Owen Wilson who does a great job as a James Garner kind of ""things-are-out of control"" cowboy and together they team up to rescue Liu. Well there are bar room brawls and Chan's amazing prowess with a horseshoe and some rope (and by the way he gets married to a squaw who turns out to be an ingenious sharpshooter).
Of course all turns out well. There are lots of high jinks, some not too bad baddies and lots of opportunities for Chan to bond with Wilson. It is a great Sunday afternoon kind of movie, reminiscent of those old comedey westerns.
The most striking thing for me was Lucy Liu. I must admit that I had only seen her in Allie McBeal and so really expected much of the same. In reality she played the princess really well: quiet pride and sensitivity! On the strength of this I am now looking forward to Charlie's Angels.

1278449,2,B00003CXJ1,"Likeable as it undoubtedly is, `Shanghai Noon' never manages to elicit more than a few mild chuckles during its 110-minute running time. You sure can't blame the actors for not trying since both Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson provide charm and energy to spare: Chan as a Chinese Imperial guardsman sent to America to ransom a kidnapped princess, and Wilson as a sardonic, well meaning, but bumbling highwayman who meet up and become unlikely buddies in the 1880's American West. The fault, therefore, must lie in the screenplay, which, though it has its heart in the right place, never breaks out into the full-fledged absurdism a set-up like this needs to really make it work. The film draws heavily from a number of earlier Western spoofs - i.e. the nick-of-time gallows rescue a la `Cat Ballou,' the mocking derision of Western movie star names in `Back to the Future III' (albeit in this case it is John Wayne who comes in for the ribbing as opposed to Clint Eastwood in the earlier film). There's even a bit of the atmosphere of `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' in the train robbery and the hiding-out-in-a-bordello scenes. Somehow, though, the authors of this film don't quite know what to do with all the elements they've gathered. Chan and Wilson certainly make for genial and entertaining partners, but the comic lines just aren't there for them to work with. Most of the jokes revolve around tired references to Chan's cross-cultural, fish-out-of-water bumbling. More successful are Wilson's glib one-liners that help to domesticate much of the action and make it relevant to modern audiences. The script, unfortunately, softens its edges by frequently lapsing into point-making sentimentality - particularly in the scenes with the shanghai-ed princess. These sequences interrupt the lighthearted, comic tone without adding any real depth to the proceedings.
Of course, one does not attend a Jackie Chan movie seeking either great acting or even decent comic timing from the martial arts stunt man extraordinaire. We come, of course, for the jaw dropping action sequences that are sure to be a major part of any Chan vehicle. Although we are not exactly disappointed by his work in `Shanghai Noon,' it was obviously decided early on in the making of this film to use this as a bridge to help Chan cross over into more mainstream filmmaking and, therefore, the moviemakers emphasize the story, dialogue and characters at the expense of the elaborate stunt work. That would be fine if the quality of the former were anywhere near the level necessary to overcome the insufficiency of the latter, but I'm afraid that Chan's physical action sequences in `Shanghai Noon,' though certainly not bad by any stretch of the imagination, still lack the no-holds-barred exuberance and playfulness of much of his previous, less narrative-oriented work.
`Shanghai Noon' is, I suppose, a tolerable time waster (and its glorious Nevada backgrounds make for some mighty impressive viewing), but, given the high energy level of its two stars, one wishes it were so much more.",972172800,,3067,5.051282051282051
1278450,3,B00003CXJ1,As of now this movie was great but the full screen they say you get along with the 2.35 is at this time not true. I have this dvd and there is NO FULL SCREEN ON IT AT ALL.

  The characters are fun and interesting. And how they interact together is a nice mix of humor and action. Jacki Chan fans should love this film. Anyone looking for a good laugh, then give this film a watch.",972000000,,419,4.225
1278452,5,B00003CXJ1,"I loved this movie. In fact, I got on Amazon to buy it today because I will be watching this over and over again. It's really funny but has warmth too in the relationship between Chan's character and Wilson's. They were both great. Jackie Chan is so wonderful and it was nice to see him in a comedy that is at least as good as ""Rush Hour"". Wilson is hilarious with his lines delivered in a quiet, dry way that makes him seem like a big child. The native american wife was a cool character but I wish she had been in it more. The DVD version has a lot of deleted scenes and other bonus features that are fun and interesting. I can't wait to see it again.",971913600,,653,4.069767441860465
1278453,4,B00003CXJ1,"After watching this one a few nights ago, I was simply shocked as to how much I enjoyed this one.  Shanghai Noon is a movie that is just so much fun to watch that it's just a real joy to sit through. I've never been a huge fan of Jackie Chan but I always thought that if he were actually given a good script for once, I may enjoy him in a movie.  Unfortunately, what they gave us first was the dismal Rush Hour, just a contrived buddy/cop story with the unfunny Chris Tucker doing his thing.  It was because of that film I was reluctant to watch this one.  I'm glad I did. Chan plays Chow Wein, an imperial guard from Old China who travels to the Old West to locate the kidnapped Princess  Pei Pei (Lucy Liu).  Once there, he crosses paths with bumbling bandit Roy (Owen Wilson).  As typical with these films, the two do not get along at first, but eventually, through a series of misadventures, the unlikely riding team become a duo and join forces to rescue the kidnapped princess. The majority of Shanghai Noon plays very typically, there's not too many surprises throughout, but that makes things even more impressive because despite the familiarity, this is still a very good movie.  Jackie Chan does his fair share of great fight scenes in this movie, some are among the most impressive that he's ever done-the bit with the Indians at the start and the confrontation involving the horseshoe are among the best.  His character is likable and partnered up with Owen Wilson, the two make for a great team.  Wilson almsot steals the show from Chan in this film, he's got a dry sense of humor and is frequently very funny.  Wilson is likely to turn into a big star in the future if this movie is any testament to his abilities. Shanghai Noon is a very good, fun movie, nothing more, but certainly nothing less.  Even those non Jackie Chan fans will find lots to enjoy here, this is an all too rare type of movie these days, one that just doesn't take itself all that seriously, but one that's a surefire crowd pleaser.",971827200,,2019,4.427027027027027
1278533,5,B00003CXJ1,"I have to admit, first off, that the above title of this review is stolen from a friend's child but--What can I say?  I loved this movie!  Is ""adorable"" a suitable word  to kick off a review of a fun kung fu western that makes no sense and has references to all kinds of not quite appropriate, for the time period, throwbacks, like John Wayne's name and other movies (see ""Butch cassidy and the Sundance Kid"")?
I had briefly looked over Jackie Chan's other movies but now I will go back and check them out further.  The man has a unique charm that is totally appealing, as well as that remarkable, remarkable classic beauty in his moves.  What a perfectionist.  And what a smile.  He lights up the screen with it. In a comedy, it's a killer combo.  The teasing aspect--he is kidding on the square in every scene--is really entertaining.
But what would he do without Owen Wilson?  What an incredibly perfect pairing.  Owen Wilson could spin straw out of gold with the way he delivers his lines.  He can make anything sound funny.
You know, all along, things will ""work out"", because in the beginning of the movie, during the train heist, Owen is such a loser at being a bad guy, and so flirty and distractable.  He's like...that kid you went to school with who was always getting into trouble and always had an excuse that no one believed and yet he always got out of whatever mess he had created.  I love guys like that.
He never tries to upstage Jackie Chan, when it is Jackie's turn to display the effortless power and purity he possess as a true kung fu master, either.
Together they make this movie a total delight.
I hope Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson make more movies together. I wanna see ""Wyatt Earp""(""what kind of name is THAT???"") and the ""Shanghai Kid"" (""awww, look, you got a better 'wanted' poster than I do!!!""), or variances thereof,--on a regular basis.  Sort of like Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Or Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Or any pairing of two people that together seems to enhance their appeal.  Cowboy duet par excellence.  and  HOW!!!!

1278534,5,B00003CXJ1,"I just wanted to add my thoughts about what really makes this movie so deep down enjoyable.  While all the other reviewers have praised it as simple entertainment, not burdened with heavy messages, I found something underneath all the great comedy, action, characters and scenery that I think also contributes a lot to the film's appeal.  There is a wonderful juxtaposition (yes I remember this word from my English lit classes lo these many years ago!) between the old and new worlds, between the traditional, homogeneous China, with its rigid rules and disciplined approach to life, and the new world of the American West, with its melting pot of cultures, its emphasis on individual freedom and all the possibilities AND problems that go with it.  The self-centered, sensitive, new-age cowboy Roy O'Bannon may have the answer that frees Chon Wang from his years of unquestioning servitude (""the sun may rise in the East but it sets here.."" a perfect trite-but- true O'Bannon-ism! ), but he still can't hit the side of a barn with his six-shooter.  To me, this movie showed both characters learning from each other exactly what their worlds lacked:  Chon Wang found the individual freedom and self-determination that opened the door to his dreams (Princess Pei Pei) and Roy O'Bannon found honor and courage and responsibility.  This movie speaks to us about problems that remain in America even today, where many people expect everything to be easy and fast, and where freedom is mistaken for entitlement.  Freedom (the new world) must be joined with discipline and integrity (the old world) for a human being to reach her/his full potential.  This movie lets you share in the achievement as Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon make their way farther along their paths.  While I laughed through the whole movie, I cared because of this human story.  It's not Pulitzer Prize material, but it makes the movie more than just the jokes.",971308800,,1925,4.950310559006211
1278535,4,B00003CXJ1,"Shagnai Noon is the latest from Jackie Chan and while it doesn't quite live up to Rush Hour it's still throroughly entertaining.  Chan plays an imperial guard sent to the Old West to escort his uncle and a crateful of gold which will presumably buy their princesses freedom.  We travel from the gray of 1880's China to the bright vibrant hues of Carson City, it's quite a ride trust me.  Along the way Jackie loses his uncle, showing a dramatic range I never knew he had, and hooks up with a wantabe cowboy by the name of Roy. Owen Wilson fills in for Chris Tucker as the comedic sidekick and suprisingly does almost as well.  His deadpan expressions and dry humor wonderfully offset Jackie's dead serious demeanor.  So the two set off to rescue the princess from the clutches of a cartel-like bad guy.  The recreation is something to see and the widescreen fomat preserves it in all it's integrity.  And the bonous features are worth the price of this DVD by themselves.  The deleted scenes are actually interesting, not like the typical babyfat we usually find on the cutting room floor, and the commentary by Chan, Wilson & Drey is very respectable.  Especially of interest is Jackie talking about all the conditions he had to endure.  He's a rare actor, one that's actually worth a twenty million dollar paycheck.",971308800,,1317,4.6869565217391305
1278536,5,B00003CXJ1,"Jackie Chan brought the genre of comedy action to life and he revitalizes it in his latest movie-Shanghai Noon. The comedy is not only physical but it is also witty with an ability to laugh at one's own mistakes. He revisits the old west and that old plot of having the good guys rescue the girl and foiling the plan of the bad guy. You may think, same old plot, it's probably boring but this movie contains that great twist. The comedy is fun and made me laugh harder than all of his old movies combined. try it out and you will realize that you just might be a Jackie Chan fan deep down inside.

1278537,5,B00003CXJ1,"Shanghai Noon is definitely one of my favorites from Jackie Chan. Although I love most of his movies, this one had a different style that made me laugh even louder. The wild west is just something he hadn't incorporated in this movies yet...and finally he did! I'll say it again and again, ""I STILL can't believe he does his own stunts! "" He is absolutely amazing! Especially in the scene when Jackie and the bandits are on the train and fighting and jumping from cart to cart. It's exciting just watching Jackie take that leap (because you know it's real...it's not any special effects...not the blue screen dubbed background). My favorite scene was when Jackie was being chased by the native tribal dudes. The flying axes really get your attention! Your heart races as you watch Jackie execute each move with flawless conviction. I also enjoy and appreciate how this movie (among other Jackie Chan/Chow Yun Fat/Jet Li flicks) is slowly bringing Chinese culture into the American mainstream. Just the use of mandarin in an American theater is a step up for the Asians. Lucy Liu and Owen Wilson also did a fine job. You'll really enjoy the out-takes at the end of the film.

1278538,4,B00003CXJ1,"Leave it to Jackie Chan to make the old west into his newest playground. This is a film that makes you wonder why there were so many serious westerns, with so few spoofs of them. Jackie Chan does a very interesting thing by taking the classic western story, and spicing it up with his own unbelievable stunts. There are many sequences here that make you realize what a talent he truly is, and makes you wonder why he is not a bigger star. Owen Wilson is also fit for his part, playing somewhat of a nieve cowboy, with a good heart and his mind in the right direction. Anyone who has seen this or is interested should know that the film was not made to be taken seriously. There was never a point where you were to expect this film to be deep and insightful, you were only supposed to see it as a film in which you have fun watching and enjoy yourself. This film holds true to both of those ideals.",970876800,,897,4.190751445086705
1278539,4,B00003CXJ1,"'Shanghai Noon' is a joy; a cliched, stereotypical, yet fun-loving
western that is as much a homage to Hollywood comedy oaters (such as
'Cat Ballou', 'Maverick', and 'Support Your Local Gunfighter') as it
is a Jackie Chan vehicle. Chan, showing less of the acrobatic martial
arts skills and hair-raising stunts than usual (perhaps as a
concession that he is approaching 50!), relies more on his charm and
sweetness, and it pays off! If you've never seen a Chan film before,
THIS is a great film to start with, as you'll see the sincerity and
wry humor that have endeared him to much of the world for the last 20
years.
Plotwise, the story is simple; a Chinese Imperial Princess
(Lucy Liu, one of the BUSIEST actresses in film!) is kidnapped by an
American tutor, and held hostage among Chinese laborers in the Old
West. Three Chinese Imperial guards are dispatched to deliver a ransom
of gold, and an inept fourth guard (Chan, who has a crush on the
Princess) is added, as a kind of servant to the others.
Enroute by
train to deliver the ransom, a holdup occurs, which introduces Owen
Wilson, as an equally inept, but thoroughly likable bandit...then the
fun begins, with doublecrosses, cliche-spouting Indians, bar room
brawls, drunken horses, shootouts, and about every other Western
cliche you've ever seen, good-naturedly tossed in! The chemistry
between Chan and Wilson is terrific (MUCH better than Chan and Chris
Tucker, in 'Rush Hour'), and some of the inside jokes (look out for
the 'John Wayne' quips!) are priceless!...
The DVD edition is truly
amazing, with commentaries by Chan and director Tom Dey, a fabulous
'Making Of' documentary, even an interactive game where you get to
'direct' Chan in a sequence!
If you're looking for a DVD that
combines action, humor, and a taste of the classic Western comedies,
this film should be at the top of your list! You WON'T be
disappointed!",970790400,,1893,4.863777089783282

1278541,5,B00003CXJ1,"Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, stuntmaster, and comedian?  Of course he is all of them!  In most cases, good martial artists aren't Jerry Seinfield; look at Bruce Lee for example.  This movie is one of the top three funniest films of all time in my opinion along with ""Rush Hour"" and ""Spaceballs.""  It has very funny sequences and not to mention action-packed.  The movie also has crazy stunts which is normal in a Jacki Chan movie, and Owen Wilson makes the movie more...  Let's just say interesting.  The fight scenes look realistic, except for the style, and the acting is well done.
The movie is about an imperial guard (Chan) along with a relative of his and a few of their best men trying to find the Princess of China (Liu) and go to the US neogiating a ransom deal.  I highly recommend this movie beause the characters are stuck in some deep sh** and the outcome is funny.  Screw the movie critics who say that it's bad blah blah and it has a bad storyline yadda yadda and it's not funny and the movie didn't let him be himself and all that crap because they have no idea what a good movie is, don't like Chan because 60% of the critics are classified as a beached whale from all that snacking, don't get any of the jokes because they don't know what they mean, or are just dumb.

1278542,4,B00003CXJ1,"Jackie Chan's movie is never a thinking movie but a movie that entertains, & letting the viewers having a great time to be savoured with the loved ones.  I always liked to watch his movie in VCD or even DVD as they enable us to watch his stunts in slow motion or rewatch the scenes again & again.  What's deceptively simple is always been rehearsed couple of times as shown towards the closing credit of the movie.  Jackie's Asian movies used to be more intense but he's no longer 20 years old but a seasoned actor & stuntman of 46 years old.  Only by achieving his stardom in Hollywood that he's able to prolonging his career as he admitted in his autobiography, ""I Am Jackie Chan"".  Shanghai Noon captured the magical chemistry between 2 buddies ie. Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid, Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in Lethal Weapons.  Both Jackie & Owen are likeable characters & their performances were seamless.  Don't be too fussy over the plots but just enjoy the roller coaster ride.

What a great show! It was hilarious from start to finish.  Plus Jackie did a great job poking a little bit of fun at our American lack  of cultural or geographical sense.
The masterpiece though was casting  Owen Wilson as the ""good-bad-guy"", a cowboy with a sense of Zen  about him.  Owen was a perfect match opposite Chan.  This film achieved  character chemistry all the Wild Wild West should have had but  didn't.
Favorite scene-- of course it had to be the ""drinking  games"" while in the bath house.

1278623,5,B00003CXJ1,"Being the wizened old sod that I am, having passed my 30th year here on Earth, I can remember the bad old days when Jackie Chan was trying so  desperately to break into the European and American markets - I can  remember watching such 'Westernised' tosh as the Cannonball movies, Battle  Creek Brawl and (shudder) The Protector and then comparing them to the  Police Story and Drunken Master classics. I can remember sitting through  the pirated, badly dubbed, piss poor videos which made watching, and  enjoying, a Jackie Chan film a real chore. Thankfully this is now changing  with most of his back catalogue now available on dvd - although the audio  and visual quality of some of these titles are a bit hit and miss.
I  consider myself a pretty ardent J.C. fan and I can say, without  reservation, that Shanghai Noon is his best American movie by quite a long  way. Many will argue that Rush Hour is superior but stand the two  side-by-side and after repeat viewings - which is a must for any Chan flick  - S.N. stands head and shoulders above it's counterpart in terms of story,  script, action, cinematography, direction.... need I say more?
Special  mention must go to Owen Wilson who exudes the type of charisma and wit the  likes of Chris Tucker and his ilk can only dream of. The onscreen chemistry  between the two is genuinely engaging which is surprising considering they  didn't exactly get on when shooting first began. Also a quick mention to  first time director Tom Dey who manages to keep everything rolling along at  a healthy pace while allowing time for some priceless interludes (drinking  game, cowboy training).
If you don't leave the cinema with a smile on  your face you've either forgotten what going to the movies is all about or  you died in your seat midway through it. Role on the inevitable sequel -  UNO MS as Jackie would say with a mouth full of bubble bath.",968112000,,1895,4.63855421686747
