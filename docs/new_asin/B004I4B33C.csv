8430034,2,B004I4B33C,"Marcelo and Micaela can't have children. Like a good Catholic, she blames it on something she might of done. Micaela gets the idea to instead adopt her niece Letizia (Lolita would be too obvious) who has been away at a boarding school. Letizia could pass for 26, which she was at the time of the film.

Letizia has some special demonic powers in influencing people and moving small objects. Some of her powers are voodoo like. She works to take control over the family with sex being weapon.

This is not a great film. It seems to have a vision of a demon, some demonic powers combined with a Lolita theme. The English subtitles appear on the screen seemingly at random, generally about 3-4 seconds before they are spoken.

8430035,2,B004I4B33C,"Let me start-off by saying, I concur and completely agree with my fellow reviewer's ('4-Legged Defender'), assessment of this film. ""Diabolicamente...Letizia"" AKA ""Sex, Demons and Death"" from 1975 and directed by Salvatore Bugnatelli, was one cheesy and *incomplete mess! Here's the story in one paragraph or less:

Sweet and innocent 'Letizia' (Franca Gonella) has returned from boarding-school to live with her uncle and aunt (Grabiele Tinti and Magda Konopka). Her aunt is mentally unstable, since she had a nervous breakdown after the loss of her baby. 'Letizia' it seems, has returned to enact revenge on behalf of her mother. She has learned how to hypnotize/mesmerize people and work on their will, from a book on parapsychology (Franz Mesmer was all the rage, in the latter part of the 19th century and early 20th century).

I'm sure plenty of maniacs in this world, have taken advantage/misused Mesmer's work, but certainly not sweet 'Letizia' (chuckle...chuckle). Anyway, this would-be 'horror/shockfest' was one dull and deadly boring mess! And here's why: it sucked! Granted, the film does seem to be *missing footage that was probably damaged beyond repair. But running all of 93 minutes, how much? So, I can't see how that would have improved this horrible and stupid story, either way. I will add One Seven Movies clearly states on the box ""culled together from the last surviving original elements on 35 mm."" And the prints of this film must have been in some pretty bad shape, because there are parts that are still scratchy with jumps/skips. But overall, the film has been fully restored, as best possible. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), NR 93 mins. (BTW: The only female lead with full-frontal nudity, was that of Franca Gonella in a shower-scene, better than none!)

Love and Peace,

Ya say ya like yer horror flix simplified, undercooked and over-the-top? Ya say ya like yer horror flix without all dem fancy-schmancy doodads like plots, special EFX and narratives? Ya say ya like yer horror flix along wit' yer likker, ether rag and crack pipe? Then step right up, folks, 'cause we done got ourselves a winner!

All joking aside, this is probably the worst Eurohorror (minus the horror) film I've ever succumbed to, and that in itself speaks volumes, as I've seen hundreds. It's like Ed Wood, Doris Wishman and Jess Franco (during his Sub Rosa years) collaborated to produce a film in one day. It's so unredeemable and unintentionally funny, you'll have a new ladder-rung on your list of all-time ""so bad they're good"" list, assuming you go in for that sort of thing. If not, you'll probably gouge your eyes out before it hits the third act.

Cashing in on the international success of 'The Exorcist', this 'satanic sex thriller' (their words, not mine) is a psychotronic sunspot that'll leave you blinded by the on-screen blasphemy and unintended black humor. The acting's bad, the subtitles are poorly done, the attempts at scares will leave your jaw slack, the plotline patched together like an Amish quilt (it appears as though there are chunks of the film missing, which would explain the 'cut and run' editing) - had this flick been released before this, surely it would have become an episode of MST3K, giving 'Manos, Hand of Fate' a good run for worst horror film of all time. On top of everything else that's criminal, the final felony is the print(s) utilized - scratched, blemished, burnt out, washed out, chopped up - every reel is of a different though equally questionable quality, and the film was cobbled together from various elements. It took more effort than it was worth to restore this syphilitic cinematic cesspool. The two selling points presented by ONE7 Movies are the nudity (which is considerable but not when measured against the unholy hokiness happening on-screen) and the 'first time available' aspects - again negated by the travesty of the flick itself. It would appear that MYA Communications (which, after viewing a toolshed full of their films, I believe is an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience') has competition in ONE7 Movies, the latest hustler of unmemorable film artifacts presented in untrustworthy quality at prices that are ridiculous.

If you're in the mood for a few friends, a few drinks and a slew of controlled substances, this comes recommended for a few good laughs and WTF moments, otherwise, consider yourself duly warned. When it comes to 'Sex, Demons and Death' being on the board, I'll take Death, Alex, for $500...",1316044800,2,2849,4.929166666666666
