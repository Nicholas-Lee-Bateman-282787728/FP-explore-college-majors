7796795,1,1567301703,"Allegedly there are four stories in this film. I cannot discern a plot or purpose in any of them. We see a lot of images of people interacting and emoting, a lot of dialogue without coherence and some music (very little Mozart), but there is no obvious structure or context that binds any of this together into something with meaning. There are a few Mozart themes, but the relevance of Mozart to the film is unclear. I do not see any artistic purpose to this work. This appears to be a cinematic Rorschach test.  The blu-ray transfer and sound are good, but that is about all that is good here.",1486684800,,595,4.409090909090909
7796796,3,1567301703,"Don't get me wrong this is one of Godard's best movies, the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of this Cohen Media edition.
Yes, this is a good Blu Ray transfer and probably for many people the only available version of For Ever Mozart, but sometimes I wish Cohen Media would try a little bit harder with their subtitles. I have Hail Mary from Cohen, too, and some Resnais films, and in every one the subtitling is so lazy and frustrating, and this is no exception.
Not only, for some reason, have they decided to not transcribe any of the names (for example, ""It's Jerome, or it's Camille,"" is provided as ""It's him, or it's her,"" when neither Jerome nor Camille are indicated in the image to make this an excusable omission), which can easily be missed when you're watching a Godard movie and trying to read the subtitles, see as much as you can in the image and montage, and take note of the background soundtracks. You have to have a lot of trust in the translators when watching subtitled Godard. Also, when characters (don't say, ""But Godard has no characters""  each character has  in this film at least  an allegorical meaning to which their name is a reference) are mentioned later in scenes in which they don't appear, the pronouns again are used instead of names. Why? Malice, I guess, since I see no other reason.
Secondly, long phrases are cut down to be as short as possible in the subtitles when there is obviously much more in them than what has been translated. This happened too many times. Why bother subtitling if you're not ACTUALLY going to translate what is said?
It seems they asked themselves this question already, and took it the wrong way, which brings me to the third point: many long passages are simply not subtitled at all. There are passages in languages other than French, and while it would have been nice to have these translated, I can understand if they aren't. There are also passages where something that was said before (be is five or fifty minutes earlier in the movie) is repeated, and these were not subtitled. For Ever Mozart goes a lot faster than most late Godard movies, and it's impossible to read, let alone retain, every single word  if Godard has someone repeat something, it was probably important, and it would have been good to take advantage of that.
Furthermore, one of the dumbest decisions is when, towards the beginning of the film, the inter-title ""30 characters in search of a (hi)story"" appears on the screen for some 30 seconds  MORE than enough time to read it  and yet plastered underneath it is the English translation, while on the soundtrack whole conversations are happening in French which could easily have been translated without compromising our understanding of the title card. Not only that, but when the title card is taken away and we are shown the interlocutors of this dialogue continuing the conversation, the subtitles still fail to appear. There is a good five minutes of French dialogue after this which is untranslated for no reason.
Other times, they seem to just pick and choose what they feel like translating  sometimes we'll get a subtitle, sometimes we won't, there's no way to really predict it.
It's probably the laziest subtitling job EVER and that's saying something since subtitles have been around worldwide since 1929 with growing frequency.

I won't give it 1 star though, because this is probably the best version of the movie you can get as an English-speaker.",1468972800,3,3470,4.733443708609271
7796797,1,1567301703,Something provoked me to buy this movie and I wish I knew what it was so I would not do it again.  Unless you are desperate for a few nude shots there really isn't anything good about this movie.  Maybe it is better if you understand French.  The English subtitle version is basically a waste of time to watch.,1460160000,,310,4.220338983050848
7796798,4,1567301703,"For Ever Mozart is a strange bilingual pun, for in French it sounds like Dreaming Mozart. So, the title has at least two meanings, and I would add another in that severing the ""for"" in ""forever"" suggests the ""four"" segments which comprise the film. If that kind of thinkingbilingual puns and stretching for meaningis alien to you, then For Ever Mozart is probably not worth your time. There's very little plot or characterization on offer, and the usual pleasures of film are not to be found here.

Instead, we're firmly in what we might call Godard's ""aesthetic phase."" This has two meanings. The first is that we're in the era of Godard's increasing obsession with the beauty of nature. For Ever Mozart gives us some lovely images to look at. Godard is a master of framing, and the theatrical plot gives him every excuse to provide us with striking tableaux. The other important meaning behind ""aesthetic"" in this case is a reference to philosophy, which also increasingly occupies Godard throughout the eighties and nineties. From his dialoguewhich often sounds like a philosophical textto his allusions to philosophy, For Ever Mozart draws on and explicitly references a host of other cultural artifacts to fuel Godard's reflection on cinema and Sarajevo. Godard demands that we follow him, catching what allusions we can, forming the pieces with our ability to take in the beautiful imagery, and ultimately piecing together a film that is as much our film as Godard's.

Looking back, I think critics have dismissed For Ever Mozart for being Godard-by-numbers. It has all the things we expect from Godard except something surprising. When the entirety of Histoire(s) du Cinema(s) was completed two years later, and then the half-digital/half-film In Praise of Love (his next feature) appeared three years after that, For Ever Mozart was abandoned in the face of much more novel works.

For Ever Mozart (Blu-ray) from Cohen aims to help viewers re-evaluate Godard's film. Presented on the back of a theatrical re-release, this Blu-ray situates the film in Godard's oeuvre and offers support for both its beauty and importance. The 1.66:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is pretty great. The source print is in great shape, with no serious damage or wear to be found. The photography has a slightly drab look to it (like much of Godard's work, to be honest), but the transfer seems true to this photographic intention. Colors are a bit muted, but detail is good where it's not hampered by the softness of the photography. It's not an awe-inducing presentation, but it suits the film. The LPCM 2.0 French track is similarly impressive. Dialogue is clean and clear, with a bit of separation. My French isn't that great, but I suspect that like other Godard releases, the subtitle track for this release doesn't translate every single word. That works for the film, since Godard is often trying to overwhelm us, and it's often unlikely even native speakers can catch everything.

The extras, though, are where this release is going to convince most viewers. Four featurettes that haven't been available in America puts the movie in the context of Godard's world. First up is an interview with Jean-Claud Sussfeld, the assistant director of Godard's La Chinoise. He discusses his observations on Godard's working methods (including all the books he prepares with), as well as his experiences with Godard and his partner Anne Wiazemsky. We also hear from Wily Kurant, who was Godard's DP on Masculin/F minine. We learn more about Godard's working methods here as well. These two interviews are not as focused on For Ever Mozart, but illuminate Godard's work generally. More to the point is an interview with Franois Musy, the sound mixer, who discusses Godard's almost-singular use of sound and image. Finally, we hear from Antoine de Baecque, author of a book on Godard (which hasn't been translated into English, apparently). He also discusses the qualities of For Ever Mozart, including the ways the contemporary Serbian situation affected the director. We also get a commentary by critic/TIFF programmer James Quandt. Though he sounds like he's reading from a prepared essay, Quandt shares numerous insights about the film, including thematic content and production info. It's sometimes a bit dull to listen to, but it's highly informative. It might even be worthwhile to watch the film first with the commentary. Finally, the film's re-release trailer is also included. In the case we also get a small booklet, featuring an appreciative essay by Fergus Daly and an interview between filmmaker Hal Hartley and Godard himself.

7796799,5,1567301703,"This and ""Film Socialism"" are the two greatest late period Godard films in my opinion.  It encapsulates everything he was experimenting with in the 80's and 90's and recoups those discoveries with the innovations of his 60's work.

""For Ever Mozart"" is as good as any of Godard's famous 60's films and better than many.  It is a beautiful meditation on the value of art, film and music in society and well worth owning for any cinephile.",1383091200,6,437,4.64935064935065
7796800,2,1567301703,"While this film may have been a fun exercise for the director in constructing several narrative lines and some beautiful images, it is a muddled and disjointed film.

Luckily I have some knowledge of French or I would have been even more at a loss than I was to understand what message,if any, this film wished to convey.  The subtitles were few and far between and they were sorely needed in a movie with many story lines and so much dialogue dealing with philosophical matters.",1138492800,10,479,4.623529411764705
7796801,5,1567301703,"Godard's career is a difficult one to summarize or even to get a grasp on. After creating the seminal New Wave films of the Sixties we all know and love him for, Godard took a drastic turn in the late Sixties-early Seventies when he began making film within his ""Dziga-Vertov"" group, which were a group of didactic films that marked Godard's complete break from narrative film. After that dead-end, Godard made many beautiful and interesting documentary-theoretical films throughout the Seventies (the best being Numero Deux, Ici Et Ailleurs & Tout Va Bien). He returned to more narrative cinema in the 80's beginning with the little-seen ""SAUVE QUI PEUT (LA VIE)"". I find most of his 80's films to be pretty weak, besides some good ones up until 1985 or so. My whole point with this rant is that Godard seems to have had an artistic re-awakening in the 90's. Starting with ""Nouvelle Vague"" in 1990, Godard's Nineties films rank up with some of his best work in the early days. Although I prefer his more recent ""In Praise of Love"" to this, but I love them both and say that they should be essential viewing for any world cinema buffs.
