2638371,5,B000HIVIRY,this is one one the most fabulous and magical things I have ever viewed. I saw it at the film festival at convergence 13 and needed to buy my own copy to show to all my friends. absolutely lovely!!!!,1180483200,4,199,4.128205128205129
2638372,5,B000HIVIRY,"This would be an astonishing film under any circumstances, given its detail & dreamlike, sometimes nightmarish quality. Knowing that it was made by one person over 13 years only increases my admiration. Truly a labor of love! Rich colors, fascinating characters that capture both the innocence & exaggerated fears of a child's world, memorable images that seem almost archetypal -- just stunning. It has the look & flavor of a very old tale, repeated over countless generations. If you're looking for something different, something very far from the mass market animation that seems to exist solely to sell cheap merchandise, then you won't go wrong here. Most highly recommended!",1176163200,16,680,5.247706422018348
2638373,5,B000HIVIRY,"This is an excellent yet very ""odd"" film.  It's definitely not a ""normal"" film like you would find in the theaters.  I really loved the film, but some people may find it a bit too odd for their tastes.  If you like artsy, dark, and symbolic sort of stuff, you'll like this film.  If you go to movies thinking the Rock is the best actor evar, then don't watch this.

The animation is quite good, and the usage of colors and images is excellent.  It's quite amazing how much you can feel for the characters in this film.  The DVD comes with some extras where you get to see the artist's  paintings as she discusses them with another person.  I recommend this to anyone who likes the ""out of the norm"" artistic films.",1169251200,9,714,4.30827067669173
2638374,5,B000HIVIRY,"This film is not for everyone, but if you like things that are truly unusual and artistic, without a lot of dialogue, check this one out. This is not a kid's movie, even though it's a fairy tale of sorts. The artist who made the film took years to hand-craft each ""puppet"" (for lack of a better word -- this is not Sesame Street...). If you like dark, artistic animation such as The Nightmare Before Christmas or Spirited Away, and/or darkly dreamy fairy tales such as The Company of Wolves or Ginger Snaps, and/or films about dreams such as The Science of Sleep, you might check out this film.",1168473600,11,594,4.458715596330276
2638375,5,B000HIVIRY,"At first the idea of ""dialogue free"" scared me off, as did stop action animation, since Davy and Goliath and Gumby always freaked me out, but I read a review in Daily Variety that compared it to David Lynch and Beatrix Potter, so I had to check it out. WOW! Deep saturated colors, amazing music and most importantly deeply gorgeous storyline with phenomenal characters that really come alive. The layers of symbolism  and the tragic tale of love and loss make this a MUST HAVE for film fans into Dali, Browning, Lynch, etc. Awesome!",1163548800,16,532,4.659574468085107
2638376,5,B000HIVIRY,"I tremendously enjoyed this movie. This is animation at its best, with patient craftmanship used in the service of a genuine artistic vision. I won't summarize the plot, which is a bit secondary. It's much more about the experience, as would be the case for something out of the Quay's brothers or Svankmajer's drawers.",1259020800,,319,4.925925925925926
2638377,4,B000HIVIRY,"I didn't really know what to expect going in to this film. I had come across it many moons ago while looking for another DVD title, then spent the next year with it on my Wishlist. I'm glad I finally broke down one day and bought it for myself. It's an interesting film, not quite as I expected, but it is beautiful, and a strange, alluring triumph. One woman, over the course of a decade, doing all the set design and filming and lighting herself, shot a feature length stop motion animation of this magnitude. It shows that this film was a learning process for her, as the shots start out too fast, and in some places too flickery from lighting changes, but it isn't too long in to the film she finds her rhythm. And sometimes the intended story points aren't always as obvious to the viewer as they were to the film maker in her fevered creative state, but you can learn to forgive her these faults, seeing as she's providing us with such an amazing journey.

This film is a real achievement that needs to be seen to be believed.",1255824000,,1032,4.347150259067358
2638378,5,B000HIVIRY,"I have watched this twice in as many days and saw more the second time. That's a good thing to be able to gain insight into a movie the more you watch.
There is no dialogue. And thankfully so.  The music, the settings, the landscape, the creatures and the cinematography all create a world that stimulate your senses and imagination.
When you read a book, you are creating the world in your mind... when i watched this, i was creating the dialogue in my mind.  Being able to do so speaks volumes to how expressive the creatures are through the details in their subtle movement. The music was also simple and mystical - simple enough to allow your mind to make your own emotions to fit the scene.
Best description I can think of : An impressionist experience that took me on a relaxing vacation away from the world.",1229040000,4,814,4.456375838926174
2638379,5,B000HIVIRY,"a lovely piece of cinema/animation. the characters, depsite having no dialog, communicate their actions in a very realistic fashion, even if the story is somewhat unrealistic. it's fantasy and very well done. the colors, sets and cinematography are top notch, with great angles and compositions. it's no wonder this took so long to complete and i'm glad she took her time. certainly worth yours to watch it at least once and decide for yourself. i also encourage you to go to her site at cafepress and pick up a copy of the book that gives a better representation of the making of the film than the very tiny images that were used in the special features section of the dvd.",1214611200,2,674,4.625
2638380,4,B000HIVIRY,"I was expecting a lot from this film, but found myself multitasking the whole time. It was ""weird"" but not the proactive weird that sucks you in (well, it didn't suck me in). I love stop-motion filming but it almost seemed rushed considering I have seen it done with much more fluid motions. All in all it was interesting to see I suppose, but I would have much rather have watched someone else's copy and returned to them and been done with it. I think personally I just missed something.

However I did love the music. I would love to have a sound track of the instrumentals for sure.

Overall the story was strange but overly simplified (probably since there is no dialogs) however there are parts that seem to suddenly jump to a level that without words made no sense but most of those were ""trippy"" ""drugged up"" scenes that I thought weren't very creative. These points rarely seemed to be significant to the story, but spent a lot of time showing off something that would hopefully come off as different.

As sour as I sound, it's just that I was hoping for much more. It was interesting, creepy, but I have seen much better as of recently, and yet none of it was what I was truly looking for. My fault really, but I still feel it was under developed.

If you like very strange movies (as I do) this might be in your tastes. However what some people might find as small aspects they hit me as much more important and lacking of creativity.

I still give it 4 stars because over all it was interesting, i loved the music and it was decently fun. Also I would feel bad giving it only 3 stars, and yet I couldn't be persuaded easily to give it 5 considering it could have been so much more (even without involving more money considering my assumption was it was pretty low budget).",1209254400,,1784,4.377643504531722
2638381,5,B000HIVIRY,"I'm really not sure how to describe this movie, so I'll start with the bare facts. Cegavske appears to have started from some art-school sketchbooks, and assembled a gorgeous stop-animation, supposedly taking 13 years to complete. She did all the design, scripting and animation, so this was clearly a labor of love. She created remarkable characters and sets, beautifully crafted. The composer she engaged for the score did an outstanding job, especially in the unearthly tones of the mouses' dance.

All of which says nothing about the characters and plot of the movie, which I still can't quite put words to. It carried the sense of a fully-elaborated dream world, but of someone else's dreams. The different beings seemed to act out rituals of deep importance, all of which eluded me. Rich, detailed imagery abounds, almost like the imagery of a Tarot deck - but with all of the arcane meanings unspoken. The viewer rides along in this wordless world, sensing the characters' urgency but never making out the reason for it.

Cegavske's puppets and props bring that baffling world to life. Even though this medium has been used for years in children's entertainment, make no mistake: this is for grownups. Skittish children might not tolerate the deaths of characters, or scenes like the ""blood tea."" A few moments drag; the script's pacing seemed uneven, and the puppet's motions never flowed smoothly. I can't let the little things get in my way, though. This stands as an incredible work of creativity, and a glimpse into another mind's imaginings.

2638382,5,B000HIVIRY,"This movie is absolutely amazing. This isn't the type of movie you sit around and watch on the couch with your friends and a bowl of popcorn - it's a strange and surreal fairy tale. Every time I watch it, I am absolutely amazed that one person put this entire film together by herself, and that she was dedicated enough to stick with the project over the 13 years that it was in production. If you're looking for action or comedy, this movie isn't for you - if you are looking for a film that is unlike anything else out there, then I definitely recommend it. It's beautiful - I am so glad I bought it. If you like independent films, this is about as independent as it gets!",1205366400,7,674,4.232558139534884
2638383,5,B000HIVIRY,"The first time I saw this film was at an event in Portland,OR this year and was left stunned by it's intricacy. The movements created by this artist go beyond physical animations of the characters and scenery;details in the environment give off an eerie,emotional quality I have not yet seen or felt translated in a film done in this way. I was thrilled when my copy arrived and was able to revisit scenes that stuck in my head. The Oak Dwellers interested me the most the first time I watched this, being a seamstress myself, however a new favorite comes along with each viewing.

This DVD is a work of art, right down to the extra features included with the film. The production notes and commentary Christiana Cegavske includes in the disc adds a lot to the watching and appreciating of Blood Tea and Red String-I definitely appreciated all the hard work and details this woman gave to the film and more so after watching the extras ( I LOVE those portraits of the White Mice :)",1198540800,3,981,4.5423728813559325
2638384,5,B000HIVIRY,great stop-motion animation and a great story to match.interesting critique on society.must-have for lovers of the avant-garde.plus.....the gal who made it is quite the stunner!,1191456000,2,177,6.12
2638385,5,B000HIVIRY,"I love animation, especially stop motion and I have been researching the medium because I want to make my own film and I found this movie extremely inspiring. I have thought of all of the work involved with puppet making, set building, animating, camera work, etc. and the process is pretty overwhelming. To see someone do it on their own and to complete a 70 minute beautiful film blows me away and I have tremendous respect for the artist. I really love her costumes and props. Thank you Christiane for enduring and completing this masterpiece.",1185753600,2,546,4.757894736842105

8139932,5,B000HIVIRY,"Some of the coolest animation I've seen. SO glad it's on Prime. Perfectly eerie and kinda macabre, but also peaceful. I watch it regularly to lull me to sleep. Showed it to my friends as well.",1509494400,,192,4.361111111111111
8139933,5,B000HIVIRY,"Amazing. On the rarest of occasions an artist's creation will breathe with life. It can be cherished as a welcome friend or it can be mindlessly consumed like a cup of blood tea. Do not consume this film mouse style.

Absorb it with your full attention and see if you see what I see.  Art is mystical and this is one of the few examples I have seen that gives honor to that mystery.",1504137600,,382,4.148648648648648
8139934,5,B000HIVIRY,"This is stop motion used to great effect with the best parts of the edge between surrealism and conventional narrative. To make a story and a world that's just on the verge of making logical sense, but doesn't. It only makes emotional sense.

Yes, there is a type of traditional storytelling here, but it's not a story that you can describe sufficiently in words. This is an aspect of some surreal art, provoking raw emotional reaction that isn't tied to reason, or is just tied enough to it that it leaves you confused about why you feel so strongly about it. The medium of stop motion is in many ways ideal for this kind of effect. It is blatantly ""other"" from our experiences, more so than traditional or 3D animation. It easily dips into the ""uncanny valley,"" and that disconnection can allow you to identify with the characters, to project yourself into them.

With a narrative like this, there is a parallel to that identification. When the narrative doesn't make strict sense, it's open for you to make it your own narrative, to project your own reason and meaning into it.

And that's why this movie succeeds. It's beautiful, it's eerie (and what's life without danger?), and mysterious. It has just enough inscrutability to project yourself into this place that we could never really understand.",1500940800,2,1304,4.786666666666667
8139935,5,B000HIVIRY,"Love love love love... waiting impatiently for the artist to finish making her next one ;)
Silent (great background music tracks) claymation stop motion style film.
Viewer gets to interpret her visions, wonderful characters.",1436918400,,224,5.617647058823529
8139936,4,B000HIVIRY,"This is a wonderful film, even if imperfect, and certainly not for every taste. Some have criticized the lack of fluidity in the stop motion animation but for me that roughness, along with the crudeness of the fabrication of certain aspects of the characters, props and sets only added to the film's allure. It is a fully created if not fully realized world,that emphasizes its artifice while at the same time introducing enough realism to keep the viewer transfixed, yearning for clarity of meaning that never arrives. The film could be thought of as Coraline's poorer cousin, but a more complex cousin. Like Coraline it introduces a world normally reserved for children, but a world so  permeated by menace that it is unsuitable for them to see. Unlike Coraline the main character is not safe from that menace. Where Coraline introduced the threat to the self of the archetypal mother, Cegavske's film plays with themes suggestive not only of the archetypal mother, among others, but of the deaths suffered by the female gender whether in the act of birth, sex, or the creative process. Elements of fable,and religious and mythical symbolism combine within a world so familiar and so remote that it disturbingly recalls not so much fiction as dream. Cegavske demonstrates what I would call a remarkable intuitive ability, because the opacity of the plot leads one to believe  even she did not fully grasp the world her hands created. A clear theme in this film is thus the struggle to control what has been created whether by those who wish to own it (the mice) or those who made it (crows/director).. The artist is repeatedly reflected in the film, as the doll, as the bird (inspiration? Muse? which looks on at the doll/film bearing a skull/death head, or later ensnared by the tellingly spinster-like spider as it attempts to be reborn/re-inspired and fly/succeed.)  And understandably so, because for all of the deliberate fabrication that went into the film and the resulting density of possible meanings, the film suffers nonetheless imho from this waver in focus....  However one interprets this film, it is a creative effort well worth watching and thinking about.... few films manage to suggest as much with as little. I eagerly await her next film in what she has called the next part of this trilogy, entitled ""Seed in the Sand.""",1434153600,2,2342,4.921518987341772
8139937,5,B000HIVIRY,"I was at this weird little, artsy bar in Seattle a few weeks ago, around Halloween, and they were playing this movie on the wall, kind of like background visuals. They didn't have the audio on as there was loud rock music playing, but I was mesmerized by what was taking place in this very odd, stop-motion, film. The film kept replaying throughout the evening, and each time I caught more and more details as I sipped my beer and watched. My wife took a picture with her phone during the credits and when we got back to California a few days later, I looked it up and ordered Blood Tea and Red String, Christiane Cegavske's masterwork. This is a brilliantly constructed piece of dark wonderment. Simply awesome.",1417219200,2,712,4.5703125
8139938,5,B000HIVIRY,"This is the most unique stop-animation movie I've ever seen. It took the creator nearly 13 years to complete and the story she tells is fascinating. Anyone who has a creative mind would enjoy seeing this movie and would appreciate the great effort it took to write the story, create all of the sets, objects, and characters in such vivid colors.",1386547200,,345,4.672131147540983
8139939,3,B000HIVIRY,"At 1st glance this ""film"" is quite boring and tedious to watch.  But reflecting back on it some of it was PURE GENIUS.  I probably would have liked it more were it shorter as the lack of dialogue lost my interest after about 30 minutes.  If you are a die-hard Stop-motion animation person, then by all means rent, borrow, or buy this film.  For the average person I do not think you will like this very much as it is not a very ""mainstream"" movie by any accounts.  The pace seems very sloooow even for a stop- motion film.  thereofore i give it the rating of merely ok.",1286496000,,569,4.222222222222222
8139940,5,B000HIVIRY,"This is an effective film in stop motion. The silent film has weird music and strange color. Hard to explain it, just have to see it. I felt like I was on mushrooms or something. Neat little film.",1264464000,,196,4.184210526315789
