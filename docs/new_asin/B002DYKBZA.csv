3914257,5,B002DYKBZA,Saw it on the TV and loved it which is why I got it.  David Tennant is great and so is David Morrissey.  I am very pleased and it arrived in great condition and on time.,1255392000,,169,3.6666666666666665
3914258,5,B002DYKBZA,"This episode is exceptional, the only thing that would be better is if david Morrisey would ever star in the show in the future as the doctor. Love tennet as the doctor as well, hate to see him go bye! anyway a great christmas treat, filled with classic doctor who joy, and cybermen adventure. Don't miss this one! You certainly will enjoy! I give it a thumbs up!",1255219200,,363,4.352941176470588
3914259,5,B002DYKBZA,"The next doctor story is pretty good, with a couple of plot twists.  The thing I really love about this DVD is it includes the Concert of the Doctors music, which could have been a dvd in itself.  A fantasic add on for the price.",1255046400,,229,4.066666666666666
3914260,5,B002DYKBZA,"This Christmas Special has a bit more comedy than others, in my opinion. The whole ""Next Doctor"" bit is very entertaining. Although the method of how he came about, and their primary weapons against the Cybermen seems a bit far-fetched and silly.

In comparison to the general series, this special is a bit less serious and is not as thoroughly backed with details, but as long as you are familiar with the series most of the information fills in. It does introduce a new type of Cyber-unit and these information storage units called ""Info-Stamps"" that hold a load of data in picture format, it would seem. There is no real information on where this new Cyber-critter came from, and the Info-Stamps are a bit overly powerful. They can project the information on a wall, be plugged into the Cybermen and the information is immediately transferred, or one can pop the cap off of them and obliterate most anything with the wonderful power core. How handy! Sounds like the ultimate weapon/tool all wrapped up into one handy hand-held cylinder! Oh, and apparently, they can imprint a lot of information into a person's mind if they hold it wrong. I kind of feel that these little Info-Stamps were given a bit too much weight in the show. It just seemed like a much-too-easy solution to everything.

This DVD comes with a 1 Hour ""The Next Doctor"" episode, along with a 1 Hour ""Doctor Who at the Proms"" special which is a musical special that takes place at the Royal Albert Hall. It is entertaining to watch as well, although they mixed in a lot of clips from the show with the video of the performance. There were many familiar aliens from the new Doctor Who series running about the audience. It must have been an awesome experience to be there!

All in all, for the price, it was wonderful! Maybe not the best Doctor Who plot of all time, but it certainly helps break up this year without any new episodes! I enjoyed it, and am happy to have bought it!",1253318400,4,1949,4.578796561604585
3914261,5,B002DYKBZA,"Doctor Who: Next Doctor is the 2008 Christmas special, a Doctor Who tradition. It is, in a word, superb. Writer Russell T. Davies continues to add layers to Who mythology, and to the character himself, as he consistently does. The characterizations of Dr Who, the ""next dr,"" and Rosita (""next dr's"" companion) are fun and vibrant, the episode is loaded with action, and the FX in the climactic scenes are quite a spectacle. I will give nothing away, but let me say that the final scene is another one of those great, poignant moments that can't help but make you love the character of (and David Tennant's rendition of) the good doctor more than ever.

I suggest you also watch the extra, which is a concert, ""Doctor Who BBC Prom,"" hosted by Freema Agyeman, and recorded at Royal Albert Hall in London. It includes a full orchestra and choir performing music from the new series, including the epic Rose's Theme, along with various alien creatures from the series 1-4 interacting with the audience. It's great fun watching how the kids in the audience respond when, for instance, they are approached by a very convincing Cyberman. In addition, a mini-episode featuring Tennant, ""Music of the Spheres,"" is projected for the audience. It is interactive and pretty clever. This is just a very fun disc. The only flaw is that the episode is only an hour long :(",1253145600,4,1357,4.75
3914262,4,B002DYKBZA,"I enjoyed this DVD. I got it from Amazon. UK. On the UK edition, it includes a concert of Doctor Who music. Does this US version contain this? It hasn't been mentioned in the other reviews, so I thought I'd ask.",1252972800,,211,4.170731707317073
3914263,3,B002DYKBZA,"I'm a Dr. Who fan from way back - I spent my early years in Scotland and watched him on the BBC. I stopped soon after Tom Baker left. The new Doctors were just too way out there.  When the new series started, I was thrilled.  I've enjoyed almost all the episodes and specials.  There are only two exceptions. ""Daleks in Manhattan"" was terrible.  Laughable. Then giving individual Daleks time travel capabilities? Where did that come from? The Dalek / human hybrid? What was the costume budget - $5 and a dead squid?  This special reminds me of that episode.

The Cybermen rely on a human as a control circuit?  Rely on inefficient kids as labor, when adults or automation would be a lot faster.  What was the power source, coal?!? And again, all Daleks have time travel technology built in?

Now let's add the method the new ""Doctor"" becomes the Doctor.  By contact with what is a digital version of ""Doctor Who for Dummy Cybermen.""  Not watching it - touching it.  Totally unbelievable, even in the DoctorVerse. Just because you watch someone fire a gun, does not mean you can instantly build one from scratch, or use every firearm ever made. A key plot point that does not pan out.

Overall it was a good romp, the the mistakes are really grating.",1249257600,4,1249,4.547085201793722
3914264,4,B002DYKBZA,"... and it's not a horrible story. I've seen worse.

Plus, most of the Christmas specials are filled with fluff anyway, in keeping with the holiday spirit. That being said, this story is a fun bit of Christmas cheer, although it lacks depth on some levels, but I'll still line it up with the other Christmas specials for Christmas morning viewing. I will say though, I thought the Cyber-Shades were kind of creepy and I hope they bring them back at some point. On the other hand, the Cyber-King ""ship"" was a bit too much on the cheesy side for me, and while I first relished the character of Ms. Hartigan, she completely crashed and burned into the cheese fest.

Another thing that stirred the bee in my bonnet was the Rosita character, and I'm going to say something that a lot of people ~ especially fans of the new series ~ won't like: Enough with Rose Tyler, already! I mean, come on. Bleeding hearts of the world unite! Enough with the references, the inferences, the parallels, the longing, the tragedy of it all, etc. The writers, including Russell T. Davies, whom I happen to actually love, being a writer myself, have beat this like a dead horse and to a bloody pulp. Yes, we know the Doctor has great affection for her; yes, we know he can never be with her, but let's move on. Please.

It's for this reason that I am really anxious for Steven Moffat to take the reins of the series ~ and in a way, I'm glad there's a new Doctor. I love David Tennant and I think he's been absolutely brilliant ~ right up there with, if not surpassing, Tom Baker ~ but this whole, galactic playboy thing (as further evidenced in Planet of the Dead) is wearing thin. The character of the Doctor is NOT Captain Kirk and he is NOT about romantic baggage, thank you very much ~ and I'm saying that as a chick, who initially loved the character of Rose and her deeper friendship with the Doctor. It was different than the classic series, with a little more humanity thrown in, instead of the cold, androgynous, teacher-student, master-apprentice dynamic. But enough.

There, I said it. I feel much better now.

On the upside, David Morrissey's portrayal of ""The Doctor"" was quite fun to watch as a romanticized, chivalrous version of our favorite Time Lord, and some of his dialogue and interaction with the real Doctor was thrilling, thinking that this might just be a future version him, with memories lost. Alas, 'twas not meant to be, which is kind of a bummer, because I think Morrissey would have made a great eleventh Doctor.

On the whole, though, it's a fun little frolic ~ not on the A-list, but rather on the B-list, in the canon of the Whoniverse. But like I said, I've seen worse, and as we tick down the days and months to David Tennant's departure, I do feel a certain sadness. He's been MY Doctor of the revived series, just like Baker was in the classic, even though I loved Christopher Eccleston, too, and I will be sad when Tennant leaves.

But hey! Viva la Doctor! As one chapter ends, another begins. And that's what the Doctor's story is all about!",1248652800,15,3058,4.499099099099099
3914265,2,B002DYKBZA,"The first 25 minutes of this 2008 Christmas special is great!  The Doctor meeting the next Doctor includes some great dialogue moments.  The chemistry between David Tennant and David Morrissey is fantastic!  The plot takes a turn for the worst however.  The Cybermen, the so called villains of the story, are extremely underused and the main villain, while the actress does a superb job, the character just never works for me.  I really don't mind the cyber-shades as they are a kinda update for the cyber-mats of old.  The Cyber-King, once it is revealed turns out to be really absurd, even for DOCTOR WHO!

Spoilers

A few things that bothered me about this episode:

1.  The infostamp with video on all the doctors.  How did the cybermen get this information?  From the Daleks?  Possibly from Torchwood 1 it's never explained!

2.  The CyberKing is a fully functional Dreadnought class space ship.  How did the Doctor know this considering no cybermen ship in the past has ever looked like a giant Cyberman, and these cybermen are from a parallel universe!

3. There is no real resolution to the Jackson Lake character.

4. The Resolution for the main villain just didn't make any sense.

While this episode does have some fun moments the story quickly falls apart.  As a completest I will buy it but I really don't think it has much replay value.",1248048000,9,1350,4.737068965517241
3914266,5,B002DYKBZA,"The thing that immediately impressed me about ""The Next Doctor"" was that you don't necessarily have to be a long-time fan to enjoy it.  But for those viewers who ARE faithful followers of the traveling Time Lord (myself included), it's a fine combination of elements that have traditionally worked in Doctor Who stories.  The episode is full of action, humor, pathos, better-than-average performances, and a sense of wonder that has long been missing from t.v. science fiction.

[SPOILERS AHEAD] The Doctor is delighted to find himself in Victorian England at Christmastime.  He is soon surprised, however, to encounter another fellow claiming to be ""the one, the only, the best"" Doctor.  With his own companion, sonic screwdriver (sort of) and TARDIS (a wonderful twist which I refuse to spoil), this Doctor is man with some crucial memories missing.  What the REAL Doctor finds out about this mystery man is tragic yet inspiring, and touches on the whole history of the series.  Oh, and did I mention the Cybermen are on-hand as well?

The entire production is first-rate, from the gorgeously-realized snowy streets to the impressive spectacle of the Cyber King on the march.  Guest star David Morrisey is so good in his role, you almost wish he WAS the next Doctor.  And like the best of the modern episodes, the resolution is both satisfying and leaves you wanting to see more.

The disc also includes an interesting special, ""Doctor Who at the Proms.""  This is an hour-long concert of the show's music peformed at the Royal Albert Hall.  In addition to big screens projecting images from the show's first 4 seasons, there are actors dressed as Cybermen, Judoon, etc. that roam through the aisles to the delight of the crowd.  Freema Ageyman hosts, with a special appearance by Catherine Tate.  It's a fun way to enjoy the great music from the show.

I have no doubt that BBC will eventually release all the one-off specials featuring David Tennant in a box set when all is said and done.  But if you can't wait, ""The Next Doctor"" is a perfect way to pass the time.",1246320000,38,2069,4.81586402266289

3914287,4,B002DYKBZA,"THE NEXT DOCTOR was the first of a series of tv specials that were part of David Tennants send off as Doctor Who as well as a way to allow new show runner Steven Moffat to prepare to fully take control of the series. The NEXT DOCTOR aired on Christmas 2008.

The Doctor arrives in London, England in 1851 and immediately has a run-in with a man (David Morrisey) who claims to be The Doctor. At first The Doctor thinks the man is a future incarnation of himself. However, he soon deduces otherwise. Meanwhile, a bitter woman named Miss Hartigan is working with Cybermen to steal children throughout the city. For her help, she has been given great power and is promised that she will not be upgraded.

THE NEXT DOCTOR is a fairly decent episode of DOCTOR WHO. Its not as serious as some of the other specials that follow. You don't have to be bogged down with a lot of backstory to understand the episode. It helps if you have a basic familiarity with the character and the series, but its not even really necessary. Besides being a Christmas episode, THE NEXT DOCTOR is memorable in the series for introducing the Cybermen data storage devices known as infostamps and for introducing the Cybershades, a kind of cyberman that had the brain of a cat or dog.

I enjoyed the episode. Some things were a bit too predictable and convenient, but that often happens in Doctor Who. The episode doesnt reveal much about The Doctor, but thats what made it such a good Christmas episode.

THE NEXT DOCTOR DVD also includes an hour-long musical special called Doctor Who at the Proms which is a musical special that took place at the Royal Albert Hall.",1390348800,,1639,4.545762711864406

David Tennant gives a very tender and nuanced performance.  Every time I watch it, I find a new aspect to admire.

This story had a great plot, it was action-packed, adventurous, and full of funny parts. The performaces stand out as absolutely fantastic. The only thing that let me down is tha fact that these Cybermen are once again the ones from the parallel Earth. What happened to the Cybermen from our universe that were in the old series?

I did go ahead and order the dvd, however, waiting a while to watch the show a second time.
The key was viewing it with the continuity of a movie format, and appreciating once again, how it delved into the Doctor's emotions and character. The addition of the ""new"" doctor and his circumstances make for a really nice story, dramatically and, in fine Dr. Who fashion.  There is the trauma of cybermen, a slightly deranged female villain and the heroic work of the two doctors.
If you were unsure, as I was, then take a chance on this and view it once again.  Especially if you're following this last year closely, having all of them on hand on dvd will be a finale to this extraordinary series. This is an integral part of that.",1262822400,3,1004,4.416216216216216

""The Doctor"" said that in the end ""they break my heart."" Here is the Doctor's dilemma; he cannot stand to go through the pain of his travels alone, but he cannot stand the pain that comes from what he puts his companions through, or what an extended relationship with one of them will bring-the ultimate knowledge that he will outlive them-he will not grow old or die, but they will.

3914319,4,B002DYKBZA,"I think this special episode (""The Next Doctor"") out on DVD was good but could have been more exciting like the next special ""Planet of the Dead"".  Unfortunately, the suspense with the Cybermen was a bit lacking compared to the 2-part episodes (""Rise of Cybermen"" and ""The Age of Steel"") from Season 2 with Rose Tyler.  The ending was a letdown and totally a cop-out compared to the 2-parter from Season 2.  But, the real twist is figuring out this new ""Doctor"" character played by David Morrissey.  Yes, he was in ""Basic Instinct 2"" with Sharon Stone but at heart is a British actor deep in BBC productions.  Hearing him talk with the REAL ""Doctor"" is a hoot and you will easily be won-over with his emotional rollercoaster ride.  Cybermen are NOT scary in this special which is sad but I think writers were counting on the whole David against David banter to last for 60 minutes.  If you are a true ""Doctor Who"" fan, then get it.  If you are the occasional viewer, then check first with ""Planet of the Dead"" before ""The Next Doctor"".  Also, I can't wait for ""Waters of Mars"" and ""The End of Time"" 2-parter season finale.  I don't get the Dish but others can catch it on BBC America in December 19 for ""Waters of Mars"" and December 26 for the first part of ""The End of Time"".

3914323,3,B002DYKBZA,"First off, let me say that if ""The Next Doctor"" has any shortcomings, it's not the fault of the actors. The two Davids (Tennant and Morrissey) give some really stellar work here; nuanced, passionate and believable. Morrissey, in particular, gives a much better performance than this deserves. I would recommend seeing this special solely for their performances alone. Even the actress who plays Rosita is delightful, and I wish we saw more of her in this episode. The actual story, however, reeks of wasted potential, even for 60 minutes. For a premise this grand, you really need two hours to properly present it all. Failing that, however, you could at least make this Cyberman adventure distinguishable from the others. Simply jacking up the awful musical score to downright-intrusive levels won't do the trick.

The revelation about the ""next"" Doctor's nature is revealed pretty early on, which deflates most of what follows. The Cybermen have learned a few new tricks, including the part-simian versions that are covered in fur, but we don't delve into exactly what they are or why the Cybermen are making them. To put it bluntly, the whole affair feels by-the-numbers. It begins with a haphazard murder mystery which turns out to be superfluous; yes, the Doctor will snoop around and find the answers instantly; yes, the Doctor will casually overpower the villain with little to no effort; yes, everyone fawns over the Doctor (the camera literally zooms in whenever someone even mentions his name) and thinks he's the greatest thing since ice cream. The only thing lacking is...well, a plot. The villain's motives and overall aim are taken for granted; she's evil, she wants to rule the world. What else is there to know?

Well, nothing much, if you're a kid. In fact, the series as a whole has been drifting further and further away from the mass appeal of the earlier seasons, and is now catered exclusively toward kids. And rather dim kids, at that; the script is overloaded with exposition, literally narrating the Doctor's every move, no matter how obvious it is to the viewer. I shudder to think what will become of this series once David Tennant's seasoned grasp of the character and his mannerisms have left the show, and the lead performances become as hollow as everything else.",1255392000,10,2294,4.955844155844156

8366449,4,B002DYKBZA,"One and a half Doctors fumble around London on Christmas Eve 1851.  The real Doctor arrives in his TARDIS, the other one has a tethered aerial release developed in style gas balloon.  The real Doctor has his fancy screwdriver, the other doctor just has a screwdriver.  Naturally, this wants sorting out but all that must wait once the Cybermen show up, following the lead of the embittered Miss Mercy Hartigan, a spiteful woman with delusions of grandeur.  What began as a lark soon turns into a rescue mission.  Can the doctors save London before the Cyberking stomps it out of existence?

8366455,5,B002DYKBZA,"This one had me confused when it started, there is a man on earth calling himself the Doctor with a companion, but who is he really. These two men get into a huge adventure together. It's Christmas time and once again potentially the end of civiliation a we know it. If only we knew how often we came to being wiped out of exsistance and on Christmas too, we would probably all crawl into bubbles for protection.

This is a great special, you can watch it having never seen anothe Doctor Who episode before, or start with Series 1 with Christopher Eccleston and watch them in order. Wikipedia has a guide to the episodes on it.

David Tennant is still to date my favorite Doctor, dressed in a blue or brown suit with converse trainers in red or tan, he is a bundle, of energy, personality, great facial expressions, and humor and he's pretty cute too. Tennant is an incredible actor.

I would highly recommend Doctor Who to anyone who likes SciFi.",1435276800,,947,4.494186046511628
