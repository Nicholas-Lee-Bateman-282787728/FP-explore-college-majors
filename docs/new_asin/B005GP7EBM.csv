8471997,4,B005GP7EBM,"This 56-minute show aired on HBO in 2009 as part of their ""HBO Documentary"" series. The producing/directing team sought out unusual ""on line dating"" stories for a possible series and, from the nearly 100 stories submitted, they selected five for this program. Though not announced, it's possible there may be a follow-up.

Each of the five stories is different and they are arranged so that when you think, ""this is an unusual story"", the next one is even different. I don't want to reveal too much about them because that would spoil your enjoyment. Let me say that one story follows an online ""romance"" which later made national news and lead to the downfall of a political figure. Another shows just how far in distance someone will travel to me their online ""lover"". The last segment (which is the longest) will introduce you to more than online dating sites. There is a whole community of online folks who meet in a ""virtual fantasy world"" to not only date but hold discussion, converse and perform.

The bonus material on the DVD is almost as long as the feature film. There are a few deleted scenes, a 25-minute ""meet the producers and cast"" panel session videotaped after it's premiere (this was poorly recorded from a seat in the audience and is often difficult to hear) and a 25-minute segment of that ""fantasy site"" (it's called Second Life) with the Director and one of the participants conversing as Avatars. Oh yes, the trailer is there too.

I found the film - directed by Robert Kenner , who directed Food Inc"". - interesting to watch. I think it will appeal to those who are searching ""on line"" for a mate or companionship as well as others - like me - who just want to see a well-crafted documentary.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Robert Kenner, the Food, Inc. director, found five great couples to feature, each one engaging and interesting with a great story to tell. The best is definitely saved for last. Loved it!",1320710400,3,318,4.5964912280701755
