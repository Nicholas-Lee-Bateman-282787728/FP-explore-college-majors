8709591,4,B00V857TGO,"This disc, featuring Roger Norrington working with the Radio S. O. Stuttgart, was recorded in 1996. It was previously issued by Arthaus in 2005. The rehearsal sequences of Mozarts 39th Symphony take just under half the playing time and the remainder is devoted to a concert performance of the symphony recorded in the same venue with the conductor and the orchestra dressed as for a live performance but without an audience actually being present. In effect it is a studio performance recorded in full concert dress.

Roger Norrington was, for years, associated with period performance on the one hand and operatic performances with the Kent Opera. On this occasion the orchestra consists of modern instruments but far below the strength of a full-sized modern orchestra.

Norrington, unlike the other conductors so far featured in this series, spends quite a lot of rehearsal time explaining his overall concepts. He has a habit of lightening this with throwaway humorous remarks and gestures, many of which seem to pass by the orchestral members. This may simply be that Norrington uses English throughout and his orchestra is German. The apparent miss-match could be a linguistic or cultural outcome.

The tempo of the minuet in the rehearsal is particularly slow, a situation that eventually the leader of the orchestra questions  the pace could be described as leaden. Norrington agrees and admits to choosing the wrong tempo. The rehearsal then continues at a more flowing, but still leisurely pace. Having witnessed Solti and Kleiber in rehearsal in the same series plus numerous other conductors such as Abbado, Karajan, Tilson Thomas, Jansons. Paarvo Jarvi, Bychkov and Pappano elsewhere for example, this lack of positive direction, not to mention a questioning of a tempo choice, stands in direct contrast to others. That alone may make this disc a particular interest and food for thought.

Having witnessed Norrington in concert in much earlier days in the late 1980s with both the Kent Opera and the London Classical Players where he was a dynamic presence, his laid-back, mostly one-handed, almost diffident conducting style in the performance part of this disc, comes as a curious alternative vision to other conductors and to the impression created in concert those many years ago.

In terms of vision, the imaging on this disc is clear and the camera work is suitably revealing without being invasive. The sound is presented in good stereo which seems sufficient for the concept. The language used throughout is English and there are sub-titles in German, French and Spanish. The sleeve notes are interesting and informative.

On this showing, Norrington comes over as somewhat individual in his approach to rehearsing and, as such, this disc provides an alternative to the more demanding approaches favoured by numerous other conductors.",1432684800,,2856,5.222707423580786
