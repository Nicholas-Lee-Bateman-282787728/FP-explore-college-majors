2219051,5,B0007LXP5Y,I am a child of the 80's and I lived for Knight Rider. Come On! Come On Already! Get the rest of the series out on DVD because I loved it when they would hit Super Pursuit Mode! I forgot what season that started in but hey its all good.,1113177600,,236,3.74
2219052,5,B0007LXP5Y,"If you go to [...] it will give you a list of all episodes per season and a description of each.  ""Goliath Returns"" is in Season 2.  Another Amazon.com review posting said it wasn't.  I don't know where that person got their information from.  I guess we'll see who's right on April 12.  I have been waiting a long time for Knight Rider to be released on DVD.  Can't wait for Seasons 3 and 4.  Hopefully very soon with hopefully some great special features.",1110585600,3,457,4.369047619047619
2219053,3,B0007LXP5Y,"David Hasslehoff returns as Michael Knight... Season 2 suffered a bit... I was critical about the series losing Bonnie for April, but I give it three and a half stars which Amazon.com doesn't allow, because of David Hasslehoff's Double role in the 2 part Goliath! K.I.T.T. VS. Semi - How cool is that?! Plus Michael VS. Garth Knight - Evil twin brothers indeed! (By plastic surgery of course!) Wilton Knight's son Garth is the real son, and Michael is the son he always wanted.  A tale of Irony... Season 3 & 4 gets 4 stars! 3- Bonnie returns! YES! And 4- Super K.I.T.T. - even more cool... Plus R.C. Is cool...
I also wanted to comment that another review I read by someone here thought Season 2 had Goliath Returns... Not true... That was season 3... Good try though... I have official complete series print out, but not updated in my computer files to share yet, sorry, only Season 1... I am a slacker! (Forgive me?) -JM",1109635200,4,923,4.526946107784431
2219054,5,B0007LXP5Y,I have the first season and I cant wait until the second season comes out. I have been waiting a long time since i got the first season. So I do recomend this dvd to anyone who likes this season,1109548800,2,194,3.875
2219055,5,B0007LXP5Y,"I'm biased when it comes to my love for the second season of Knight Rider. You see, it was watching second season eps like 'Ring of Fire', 'Merchants of Death', 'Brother's Keeper', 'Big Iron' (these were some of my earliest KR memories) that made me fall in love with the show!! But seriously, even without these fond early memories, you can't deny the greatness that is Season 2! Two Goliath eps (two of the best KR eps) in one season?! Come on, you just can't beat that!! Especially, when the second one even surpasses the first one! Need I say more? How about the fact that Ann Turkel (the best 'femme fatale' of the series) is also featured twice in this season as Adrienne Margeaux in 'Soul Survivor' and 'Goliath Returns'! Other awesome eps include 'Merchants of Death' (with the AWESOME battle helicopter that fires sledgehammer missiles), 'Ring of Fire', 'Knightmares', 'A Good Knight's Work', and yes, even 'Mouth of the Snake' (despite the fact that Michael and KITT aren't the main focus there). Also the opening credits are the best for this season, April is as lovely as ever, and the turbo boosts of this season are more frequent and better than ever!!! Best season!!! Case Closed!",1108944000,10,1195,4.75
2219056,5,B0007LXP5Y,"Season 2 is perhaps one of the best and exciting seasons of Knight Rider.

2219061,5,B0007LXP5Y,"In 1983 I was captivated by the show and used to enjoy watching it, that was when I was 17 years old, now being over 50 and a bit more selective about my taste I was not sure about watching this show again and if it had aged nicely considering the advances in Computers, self-driving and parking cars, cameras and GPS and talking Devices and Assistants. To my Surprise, the Hoff and KITT and the whole show was as captivating and entertaining as it was when I first saw it. The action, dialog and KITTs sarcasm makes the show alive and enjoyable. The guest stars and stories are intriguing and thrilling, few techno-babble rubbish as in some of todays goofy shows, good music some of my favorite 80s songs WOW, and good action (real action  with no overdone CGI).  Its Fun, your kids or grand kids may join you and see what it was like to be back in the 80s. After ordering the 1st season, I ordered the 3 remaining seasons and I have enjoyed watching them. Technically, Great Picture, great Sound and Easy Slick Menus. Season 2 in particular is fun to watch! Very Nice, almost no dull moments!",1460419200,,1094,4.437810945273632

It seems that Knight wants to wage a war against criminals who operate above the law. And Michael is the man he has chosen to wage that war. He has created the ultimate car, the Knight Industries Two Thousand or KITT, which is laced with a virtually indestructible alloy, and is also capable of moving on its own and also talks. He gives the car to Michael, and gives him the new identity of Michael Knight. Michael is assisted by one of Knight's associates, Devon Miles. Bonnie is the mechanic who takes care of KITT. During the second season Bonnie was replaced by April, as the new mechanic. The folowing season she left and Bonnie returned.

2219081,1,B0007LXP5Y,I really liked this program so it was a disappointment to me that the first set arrived and they were two-sided disks and I had numerous scratches on them one side wouldn't even play at all. I returned it to get a replacement set. the disks were loose and fell out when opened as the spindles were broken. Then the episodes kept freezing and wouldn't play at all on some of them. As much as I like the program I returned the second set and gave up on getting anymore due to the repeated problems. Amazon what's great about their return policy as usual. It's a shame they didn't address the manufacturer on this issue as I had the same problem with season four and had to return two sets of those.,1423353600,,696,4.28030303030303

2219097,2,B0007LXP5Y,"Knight rider season 2 dvd 2014 reissue by Universal studio, there is nothing new here
all it is , is a repackaging of all the Discs in 1 clamshell keepcase with new cover art
the original 2004 release was a fold out Digi pak, understand the difference
Universal has done the exact same thing with season 1, 3 and 4
so all your doing is buying new repackaging actually if you buy this new 2014 release

Knight rider is one of my favourite 80's shows i grew up watching it
so it makes no sense to me why Universal would just do another DVD re-issue of this classic show
it makes more common sense to release this show on blu-ray actually
with all new clearer picture quality than the dvd release and new Master Audio quality

It Disgusts me why universal just re-issued this show again on DVD
when they can easily reissue all 4 seasons on blu-ray now a days
blu-ray is in now and has been since 2008, in my opinion DVD is forgotten the future is blu-ray quality.
you can get Master Audio 5.1 or 6.1 quality with blu-ray, not DVD

i love the show
so the 2 star rating is for this new 2014 reissue which Universal did not need to do
the 2004 versions of Knight rider are still available on amazon.com, so it makes no sense to me waste of money
if anything , universal studio should have reissue this show on blu-ray, not DVD again

2219102,5,B0007LXP5Y,"I have been a fan of Knight Rider for years, ever since I first saw it on USA Network back in the 90s. The car was cool, the driver was awesome, and the plots of good vs. evil were refreshingly clean and direct. April in particular was hot, the perfect combination of brains and beauty(and the way she stands up to Garth Knight is something to be remembered), and is a worthy replacement, albeit a temporary one, for Bonnie Barstow. Great fun all around.

(For the record, some people have written on here that the voice of K.I.T.T., William Daniels, passed away in the late 90s. That is not so. I just checked his biography, and he's not only still alive, he's currently filming a new series called Girl meets World, a spinoff of the 90s sitcom Boy Meets World. In both series, he plays the high school principal George Feeny. So rest easy, fans. ""K.I.T.T."" is alive and well.)",1403827200,,878,4.4875

2219110,4,B0007LXP5Y,"This was an enjoyable season, as the show was really beginning to hit its stride as remembered; the only detraction in this experience is that the second disc of the set played once, and then seemed to develop a problem of stalling and skipping.  Thus the four stars instead of five.  It may be this set alone, or it may be inherant to the disc production process.  I hope the former, as I plan to eventually buy this season again to replace it; I hope that this small risk does not prevent those who wish to have this show in their collection from making an attempt at getting it.",1390780800,,581,4.3119266055045875

all the wrong reasons.  Just watching the episode
Goliath will bring uncontrollable laughter.

There really is nothing better than watching
David Hasselhoff playing his evil twin, Garthe.

this volume (he reprised the role in Goliath Returns
in even more silly performances) a must-have for

2219130,4,B0007LXP5Y,"I've just bought all seasons and so far I'm into Season 2.

This is a fascinating show because I am looking at my past. When I was a small boy I didn't know how to interprete storylines well let alone American ones. Now I can easily understand and learn the whole story thanks in part due to the subtitles as well. It was also interesting to note that in some episodes there was only one (1) option of language = English and then some had no other language subtitles support. hahaha.. i thought that was funny. The development team didn't bother to hire translators I guess at those times.

I enjoy watching Knight Rider for the stories and for the action too, and there is so far enough action to keep me happy. I was a bit dissappointed though about 'Ring Of Fire' because the story was slow and it was a low budget episode because most of the action was in the bush!. It was perhaps the only time I remember getting up to deliberately stop the DVD player, as I had to do something else. But no worries I shall see that episode again!.",1232841600,,1037,4.285714285714286

2219137,5,B0007LXP5Y,"I love this over-the-top 1983-84 Season DVD of KNIGHT RIDER and it is even better than KNIGHT RIDER's 1982-83 Season even though this season left us mourning the loss of the foxy Bonnie Barstow, because the 2nd Season was more upgraded & even more stellar with more action in it than the 1st Season was along with the fact that this 1983-84 Season was also the season when NBC had moved KNIGHT RIDER to Sundays since NBC had announced in the Summer of 1983 that KNIGHT RIDER was jumping to a new day & time on Sunday August 28, 1983 at 8PM in order to help reel in more viewers to tune into watching this show since Fridays are usually family night which makes it harder to make time for your favorite shows as opposed to Sunday nights since most people have to go to work and to school on Mondays which decreased scheduling conflicts for KNIGHT RIDER viewers along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was still in its honeymoon phase of the show during this season & was still wiping everything out in the Nielsen ratings on top of that.

Therefore when NBC moved this Supercar drama to Sunday nights in the late Summer/early Fall of 1983, it gave me something to look forward to every Sunday, since I've never been too fond of Sundays, despite the fact that I still preferred KNIGHT RIDER on Friday nights, but it helped the DUKES OF HAZZARD get some of its viewers back since KNIGHT RIDER and the DUKES OF HAZZARD weren't on the same night anymore, especially not at the same time slot which helped get more people to tune in to watching the DUKES OF HAZZARD on Fridays again.

Therefore K.I.T.T. wasn't the hottest car on Friday nights anymore and the General Lee pretty much became the hottest car on Friday nights again even though KNIGHT RIDER was still K.O.ing the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the ratings and had already stole the Dukes thunder when this show premiered on NBC in the Autumn of 1982 since the Knight 2000 was able to do 10 times more than the General Lee could ever do.

Therefore CBS probably would've ended up cancelling the DUKES OF HAZZARD by the Spring of 1984 if NBC kept KNIGHT RIDER on Friday nights and moved KNIGHT RIDER from 9PM to 8PM on Fridays instead of moving KNIGHT RIDER from Friday nights at 9PM to Sunday nights at 8PM since KITT practically beat the General Lee to a pulp & really would've conflicted with the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 8PM time slot on CBS every Friday night along with the fact that the DUKES OF HAZZARD had already lost a lot of viewers through KNIGHT RIDER in the Fall of 1982 on top of that, but what I found kind of intriguing about NBC moving KNIGHT RIDER to Sundays in the early Fall of 1983 was the fact that KNIGHT RIDER had been shown on a Sunday night instead of a Friday night when it made its debut on NBC in September of 1982 since the pilot episode of KNIGHT RIDER was the only episode from the 1st Season that had its original air-date on a Sunday instead of a Friday, but the rest of the 1st Season episodes were shown on Fridays since KNIGHT RIDER was shown every Friday night at 9PM at the time starting with the ""Deadly Manuevers"" episode.

Therefore I was at first under the impression that maybe NBC was going to have KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights instead of Friday nights when they showed the pilot episode of KNIGHT RIDER for the very first time on NBC even though I had already heard in the Summer of 1982 that KNIGHT RIDER was going to be the hottest car on Friday nights like the General Lee from the DUKES OF HAZZARD used to be and that KNIGHT RIDER was coming to NBC in the Fall of 1982, but for some reason NBC had showed KNIGHT RIDER on a Sunday just that one time in its 1st Season, which may have been due to scheduling conflicts on NBC and/or perhaps to get more people to tune in to watching this show in order to get people hooked on it since it was the kind of show about a supercar that nobody had ever seen before as well as the car every other person wanted back then, especially kids, including myself.

In addition to that, I would have to say that KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season was probably when this show was at its peak and when KNIGHT RIDER had its best ratings since this show was still skyrocketing in the Nielsen ratings at an all-time high during this season since the ratings in KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season were even better than its First Season and better than its last 2 seasons since there was a slight decline in ratings when KNIGHT RIDER hit its Third Season, despite Bonnie's return to the show and April's departure from this show in the Autumn of 1984, plus the ratings dropped drastically to an all-time low during its last season when this shows reputation was tarnished in the Winter of 1986 which led to its cancellation in the Summer of 1986 after completing an unsuccessful Fourth Season on NBC.

Therefore the ratings on KNIGHT RIDER were never as good after this season and were never as strong as the first 2 seasons either after KITT got a new dashboard installed by Bonnie when she returned to the show in the 3rd Season and when newer shows like the short-lived Supercycle drama STREET HAWK premiered in the Winter of 1985 & stole KITTs thunder nearly killing this show practically beating it to a pulp since STREET HAWK had outclassed the Knight 2000 & had better ratings than KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF both did on top of that despite the fact that this show had better ratings when K.I.T.T. had his old dashboard than when he had his new dashboard since KITT was more upgraded with more additional upgraded features and accessories that he didn't have in this season or in the first 2 seasons either, which you could see for yourself when you watch an episode from this season and compare to watching an episode from the Third Season.

So not only did STREET HAWK K.O. KNIGHT RIDER in the Nielsen ratings, STREET HAWK & Jesse Mach(Rex Smith)also stole ""The Man, The Machine"" motto away from Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff) & KITT too since the ratings on STREET HAWK were at its peak when it made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985 on NBC's rival network ABC.

Therefore, KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF couldn't even touch STREET HAWK during its 3 1/2-month run on ABC either, but the fact that STREET HAWK was too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF & kept giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend not only led to its own cancellation, it also led to the cancellation & declining ratings of KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF too, especially since STREET HAWK premiered too soon after AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER both did since STREET HAWK made its series premiere in the Winter of 1985 even though it was originally scheduled to debut in the Fall of 1984, AIRWOLF made its series premiere on CBS the previous year back in the Winter of 1984, and KNIGHT RIDER made its series premiere in the Fall of 1982.

As a matter of fact, I was 11 years old in the 5th grade at Desert Gardens Elementary School in El Centro when this season was running on NBC.

I also noticed in the Second Season that KITT actually had some more upgraded features than they showed in the First Season too, even though KITT still had the same dashboard as he did in the 1st Season along with the fact that when David Hasselhoff had announced in a TV Guide article in June of 1983 that KNIGHT RIDER was moving to Sunday nights in the early Fall of 1983 and that the producers of this show had used 4 black '82 Pontiac Trans Ams to run the show, not just 1 Trans Am, in order to prevent costly repairs, since Hasselhoff even explained that in actuality whenever Michael & KITT did a stunt scene that they would use KITT lookalike cars to do the stunts and that sometimes the cars they used for all the stunt scenes would even break in half whenever the car landed during a turbo boost scene and would frequently have to replace and repair them whenever the outside of the stunt cars would get banged up or damaged by replacing the outer shell of the Trans Am stunt cars with a new outer shell underneath kind of like peeling the skin off of an onion, which was very similar to how the producers of the DUKES OF HAZZARD ran that show with the General Lee and how the producers ran the
FALL GUY with Colt Seavers fancy GMC Sierra Grande pick up since the General Lee and Colt's pick up both used to get racked up frequently during the stunt scenes on both the FALL GUY & the DUKES OF HAZZARD.

In fact I noticed that in most of the stunt scenes on KNIGHT RIDER, especially in the first 2 seasons of that show that they had Michael driving a black Trans Am KITT lookalike car with a regular round sterring wheel instead of using the main KITT with the fancy pilot style steering wheel with the fancy dashboard, especially when Michael drove KITT on rugged terrain or did major bumps or drove on 2 wheels in ski-mode since it would've been too hard, too risky and too expensive to do it with the main KITT with the fancy dashboard.

In addition something else I had noticed about KNIGHT RIDER's 1983-84 Season was this season had more 2-hour special episodes than any other season throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC like ""Goliath"", ""Mouth Of The Snake"", & ""Goliath Returns"" along with the fact that this was the season when technician April Curtis(Rebecca Holden)replaced spunky technician Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson), which was of course before Bonnie's return to the show in the Fall of 1984 when April departed along with William Daniels who played the high-strung arrogant Dr. Mark Craig on ST. ELSEWHERE providing his recurring uncredited role as the voice of KITT and Edward Mulhare making his recurring role as Michael's British overlyconcerned boss(Devon Miles)whom was also like a father figure to Michael just like Dr. Huer(Tim O'Connor)was to Buck(Gil Gerard) on BUCK ROGERS:IN THE 25TH CENTURY, but when April replaced Bonnie in this season it felt kind of like it did when Deputy Cletus(Rick Hurst)had replaced his predecessor Deputy Enos(Sonny Shroyer)as Sheriffs Rosco's fellow deputy on the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Dukes 3rd Season when Enos left the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the Fall of 1980, but when Bonnie returned to KNIGHT RIDER, it felt just like when Deputy Enos(Sonny Shroyer)had returned to the DUKES OF HAZZARD as Rosco's fellow deputy again in the Dukes 5th Season when Deputy Cletus(Rick Hurst)had eventually departed from that show in the Fall of 1982 after only 5 episodes.

In fact the reason why Bonnie's departure and replacement by April on KNIGHT RIDER felt just like Enos's departure and replacement by Cletus on the DUKES OF HAZZARD was because most people obviously preferred Bonnie to April and wanted Bonnie back on KNIGHT RIDER just like most people preferred Enos to Cletus and wanted Enos back on the DUKES OF HAZZARD since April didn't stand out as well as Bonnie did just like Cletus didn't stand out as well as Enos did.

In addition to that, it was interesting seeing David Hasselhoff playing his first dual role in the ""Goliath"" episode and then again in the ""Goliath Returns"" episode as both the reclusive crime-fighting investigator(Michael Knight) and as Wilton Knight's evil estranged son(Garthe Knight).

The ""Merchants Of Death"" episode was also kinda neat when Michael & KITT go up against a futuristic superchopper with heavy artillery, since it was kind of like watching KNIGHT RIDER battle AIRWOLF in a way, even though AIRWOLF hadn't even came out yet, which takes me back to memory lane when the Superchopper drama AIRWOLF made it's debut on CBS in January of 1984, especially since AIRWOLF became in hefty competition with KNIGHT RIDER along with the fact that AIRWOLF was on CBS every Saturday night while KNIGHT RIDER was on NBC every Sunday night, but KNIGHT RIDER still got better ratings than AIRWOLF did.

It was also interesting watching the recluse Michael reunite with his ex-fiancee Stevie(Catherine Hickland) in the ""Let It Be Me"" episode when he goes undercover as a singer to flush out the culprits who had Stevie's former band member/lover(John Patrick-Reger) killed along with the fact that the ""Let It Be Me"" episode used intriguing clips from the ""White Bird"" episode of when Michael was getting reaquainted with Stevie after his identity change and then Michael and Stevie singing a love song called ""Let It Be Me"" to one another towards the end of that episode just before saying another tearful goodbye along with the fact that I noticed KITT and many other things were more upgraded in the ""Let It Be Me"" episode than they were in the ""White Bird"" episode along with the fact that KITT and numerous other things on this show were more upgraded and improved in KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season than they were in the 1st Season, even though KITT didn't even have his new dashboard yet, but coincidentally, David Hasselhoff and Catherine Hickland were married in real life at the time during KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Seasons, but ended up in divorce not too long after NBC had cancelled this show in August of 1986.

I also noticed that Knight Rider's 1983-84 Season also had a lot of cool songs from the early 80's and even quite a few from the 70's that were resung by different artists on this show.

For instance in the episodes
*GOLIATH played the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by The Rolling Stones

*BROTHERS KEEPER played the song ""She Works Hard For The Money"" by Donna Summer

*MERCHANTS OF DEATH played the songs ""California Girls"" by The Beach Boys and ""Breakdown"" by Tom Petty

*BLIND SPOT played the songs ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello and ""Oye Como Va"" by Carlos Santana

*RETURN TO CADIZ played the song ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police

*KITT THE CAT played the sings ""Telefone"" by Sheena Easton

*CUSTOM KITT played the songs ""Promises Promises"" by Naked Eyes and ""One Thing Leads To Another"" by The Fixx

*SILENT KNIGHT played the songs ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart"" by Yes and ""Gypsy"" by Fleetwood Mac

*DIAMONDS AREN'T A GIRLS BEST FRIEND played the songs ""Human Touch"" by Rick Springfield and ""Ain't Nobody"" by Chaka Khan

*WHITE-LINE WARRIORS played the songs ""Crumblin Down"" by John Cougar-Mellencamp, ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello, and ""Rhiannon"" by Fleetwood Mac

*GOLIATH RETURNS played the song ""Heart & Soul"" by Huey Lewis & The News

*MOUTH OF THE SNAKE played the song ""Stay With Me Tonight"" by Jeffrey Osborne

*BIG IRON played the song ""Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys"" by Johnny Lee

But for some reason they didn't play the song ""Little Red Corvette"" by Prince in the ""White-Line Warriors"" episode or even in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode like they should have since that song was originally played on those episodes during their original air-dates on NBC and even when KNIGHT RIDER was shown in reruns on cable TV and in syndication.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Tim O'Connor in the ""Brother's Keeper"" episode after his co-starring days as Dr. Huer on BUCK ROGERS

*Mario Marcelino in the ""Race For Life"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & Molenski's fellow officer(Det. Jimmy Rivera)on the police drama HUNTER

*Joanne Pflug in the ""Diamonds Aren't A Girls Best Friend"" episode after her co-starring days as Colt Seavers agent(Big Jack)on THE FALL GUY

*Catherine Hickland in the ""Let It Be Me"" episode before her co-starring days on ONE LIFE TO LIVE and PORT CHARLES

*Robert O'Reilly in the ""A Good Knights Work"" episode before his co-starring days on STAR TREK:THE NEXT GENERATION and STAR TREK:DEEP SPACE 9

*Michael Fairman in the ""Brothers Keeper"" episode after his co-starring days as Mr. Heller on the short-lived Sci-Fi series THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR and before his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Mary-Beth Evans before her co-starring days as Kayla on DAYS OF OUR LIVES and before her co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL, and AS THE WORLD TURNS

*Lydia Cornell in the ""Speed Demons"" episode during her co-starring days on TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT

*Anne Lockhart in the ""Return To Cadiz"" episode after her co-starring days as Lt. Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*Lance LeGault in the ""Knight & Shining Armor"" episode during his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM and co-starring days as Magnum's disgruntled Navy nemesis(Col. Green)on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Shanna Reed in the ""Let It Be Me"" episode before her co-starring days on MAJOR DAD

*Robert Colbert in the ""Mouth Of The Snake"" episode after his co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Ethan Wayne in the ""Speed Demons"" episode before his co-starring days on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL and before his co-starring days as Los Angeles police Officer Matt Doyle on THE NEW ADAM-12

*Gerald Gordon in the ""Brothers Keeper"" episode during his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Dana Elcar in the ""Merchants Of Death"" episode before his co-starring days on MACGYVER

*Bryan Robbins in the ""Soul Survivor"" episode before his co-starring days on HEAD OF THE CLASS

*Peter Mark-Richman in the ""Goliath Returns"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA

*Bill Boyett in the ""Knightmares"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*L. Charles Taylor in the ""Mouth Of The Snake"" episode after his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Nicholas Coster in the ""Return To Cadiz"" episode after his co-starring days on SHERIFF LOBO, ONE LIFE TO LIVE, ALL MY CHILDREN, and before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA

The KNIGHT RIDER-Season 2 DVD also provided a brief summary of each episode including their original air-dates just like Universal did with the KNIGHT RIDER-Season 1 DVD and the KNIGHT RIDER-Season 3 DVD, plus they showed each and every episode complete and uncut just like they were shown when I watched them for the first time on NBC back in the early 1980's

For instance, the original air-dates to each 1983-1984 Season are
10/2/83-GOLIATH
10/9/83-BROTHER'S KEEPER
10/16/83-MERCHANTS OF DEATH
10/23/83-BLIND SPOT
10/30/83-RETURN TO CADIZ
11/6/83-KITT THE CAT
11/13/83-CUSTOM K.I.T.T.
11/27/83-SOUL SURVIVOR
12/4/83-RING OF FIRE
12/11/83: KNIGHTMARES
12/18/83: SILENT KNIGHT
1/8/84: A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR
1/15/84: DIAMOND'S AREN'T A GIRLS BEST FRIEND
1/29/84: WHITE-LINE WARRIORS
2/5/84: RACE FOR LIFE
2/12/84: SPEED DEMONS

5/13/84: LET IT BE ME
5/27/84: BIG IRON

KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season was also the 2nd most phenomenal year of KNIGHT RIDER on NBC too along with the fact that this was the season that gave me something to look forward to every Sunday, especially since I've never been very fond of Sundays, but at least I had something else to look forward to on Sunday nights before going back to school on Mondays, since KNIGHT RIDER was part of NBC's Sunday night line-up at the time along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was at its peak of its 4-year run on NBC during this season on top of that.

In fact, that reminds me of when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"", since that was their slogan on NBC back then from the Fall of 1983 thru the Spring of 1984.

I also noticed that after watching the 2-hour special episodes like ""Mouth Of The Snake"" and ""Goliath Returns"" on this KNIGHT RIDER-Season Two DVD that USA, WGN, Sci-Fi Channel, TV Land, and all the channels that showed the KNIGHT RIDER reruns in syndication had cut out so many scenes, especially in the 2-hour episodes, which was great to be able to see uncut, but such a shame that there were so many scenes in each episode that I didn't even know were actually there before, especially in the ""Mouth Of The Snake"" episode and ""Goliath Returns"" episodes, which made it seem like about half the scenes in those episodes were deleted to allot more time for commercials in between.

The only problem I have with this KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD is for some reason some of the episodes like ""Knightmares"", ""White-Line Warriors"" skip or freeze a lot at times, which may be due to each disc being dual-sided, which is perhaps part of the reason why Universal had decided to make & release the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD recently to compensate for all the flaws that Universal made with the 2-sided disc of each individual season box set of KNIGHT RIDER by redoing each episode on single-sided discs instead of double-sided discs, despite all the budget cuts and weak economy we've been having lately from the recession going on right now that former president(George Bush, Jr.)and Governor(Arnold Schwarzenneger) caused us.

Additionally, the one thing I could never understand about this season was the ""Goliath"" episode was not only the Season Premiere to KNIGHT RIDER's 2nd Season, it was also the very first episode with April Curtis(Rebecca Holden), but for some reason on the show there was never any formal introductions made that April had joined Michael, Devon, KITT, and the Foundation as their new co-worker as well as KITT's new mechanic acting as if April had already been on the show all along with no mention about Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson) or why Bonnie left the Foundation and got replaced by April either, plus I also noticed that Michael didn't flirt with April nearly as much as he flirted with Bonnie either, which was probably an indicator that Michael preferred Bonnie to April like most other people did.

In addition to that in the ""Big Iron"" episode, ""Big Iron"" was not only the Season Finale episode to KNIGHT RIDER's 1983-84 Season, but Michael & KITT mentioned April's name a lot in the ""Big Iron"" episode along with the fact that Rebecca Holden's name and credits were still in the introduction to the ""Big Iron"" episode like all the other episodes of this season even though April didn't even come out in the ""Big Iron"" episode, despite the fact that Michael & KITT kept mentioning April's name a lot in the ""Big Iron"" episode giving us the impression that April was still a part of the show and wasn't about to leave the show or the Foundation by a long shot, especially since ""Big Iron"" was the last episode of KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season, but then Bonnie returns to the show and to the Foundation as KITT's mechanic in the following episode ""Knight Of The Drones"", which by the way was the Season Premiere to KNIGHT RIDER's Third Season when Bonnie gives KITT a major upgrade with a major facelift with a new dashboard.

Therefore in actuality the ""Let It Be Me"" episode was Rebecca Holden's last real episode on this show, not the ""Big Iron"" episode since the ""Let It Be Me"" episode was when April made her last appearance on this show before Patricia McPherson's return to the show in September of 1984, but I also noticed that April didn't appear in the ""Mouth Of The Snake"" episode either, which therefore means there were at least 2 episodes in this season without April Curtis, despite her name on the introduction and credits to this season.

Overall, I recommend this DVD to anyone who bought and liked KNIGHT RIDER-Season One and I think anybody who was a KNIGHT RIDER fan like me who watched KNIGHT RIDER religiously on NBC every Friday night in the 1st Season and every Sunday night in the 2nd and 3rd Seasons would agree with me on this review for KNIGHT RIDER's Second Season.

Something else I noticed in this 1983-1984 Season was the hotel they used for the episodes ""Soul Survivor"", ""KITT The Cat"", and ""Goliath Returns"" was the SHERATON UNIVERSAL in Universal City and that they had also shown us the Universal movie distribution building in Universal City in the ""KITT The Cat"" episode too.

In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will be releasing the detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 on DVD on March 9th, 2010 and is now available for pre-order along with the fact this this DVD season of KNIGHT RIDER and MATT HOUSTON both take me back to memory lane to the Summer of 1988 when KNIGHT RIDER was shown at 5PM followed by MATT HOUSTON ar 6PM weekdays on KTLA from July of 1988 thru September of 1988.

By the way, the Shout Factory will finally be releasing STREET HAWK out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 which shall give all you high-tech fantasy TV show fans out there something else to look forward to.",1201132800,,24160,4.6966903073286055

The music is from progressive music in the day, the car is a big highlight of the show just like in Miami Vice (boats too) and the star keeps saying ""pal"", just like Sonny in Vice.

By the way, the intermissions have a car coming fast from the distant view and has it coming right at us.  The Prisoner, from the 60's, used the same exact shot only with an older sportcar.  Whew, is nothing original in tv?",1195862400,,507,4.185567010309279

2219141,4,B0007LXP5Y,"Ahhh... The early 1980's. Reagan was president, new wave dominated the radiowaves and MTV actually played MUSIC VIDEOS! Ask anyone who grew up during this period what their favorite non-animated show was as a kid and they'll probably say ""Knight Rider"" (unless they're from the south, then they'd probably say Dukes of Hazzard) KR, as its affectionately called by some fans, may seem quirky and obscure nowadays with its atari centipede sound effects, poofie aqua-net hairdo's, over-acting and ""sooo not the original artist"" song usage, but we didn't care...

To us this was the best thing on TV besides Smurfs and He-Man and it appealed to our parents as well. KR was like James Bond meets Herbie the Love Bug. While our mothers drooled over the blue-eyed hunky Hasselhoff, we were captivated by the ominous-looking but friendly talking black Trans Am, K.I.T.T. (Knight Industries Two Thousand) we giggled at the odd-couple banter between Michael and KITT, we smiled everytime theives tried to steal KITT and failed, and we cried when KITT got destroyed (but they -always- managed to fix him, otherwise there was no show).

I stumbled across Season 3 in a mall for $24. The visual quality of these discs is pretty good although what's really missing is some blooper outakes (yes, they exist and they're hilarious) director/actor interviews and a behind the scenes look at how all the KITT's were crafted by tv & movie car builder, George Barris. Another minus point is the double sided DVD's which are impossible to -NOT- smudge.",1143158400,2,1530,4.996078431372549

I thought it was my own DVD player until I tried it in other players and even my computer, and it did the very same thing.  The double sided discs have to go, but I guess all the seasons have been made now so it doesn't matter.  I would be willing to pay more money for single sided discs, and hope that Universal thinks of this for future releases of any TV show on DVD.

The episodes are very good quality, maybe not as good as some movie dvds, but definitely better than the quality of the show on tv. I like the dvd menu's and stuff. What i didn't like was having 3 double sided discs, i don't like double sided discs. But the packaging is good and discs are well protected and at the same time easily accessable.",1136851200,6,667,4.099236641221374
2219144,5,B0007LXP5Y,"Nothing anyone writes for a review is going to ""make"" you buy this DVD set - you are either a Knight Rider fan and get it, or you wish you were. :-)

That said, there are two problems with the DVD set. One is the lack of ""Behind the Scenes"" material. Shame on Universal for not unlocking the vaults. You know there is a wealth of bloopers, outtakes, and general footage the KR faithful would have given their eye teeth to have included in this set. Mores the pity they cannot see that pleasing the faithful will equal more profits.

Problem two - Same complaint as all DVD sets. Yes, we understand the ramifications of copying the DVD, and yes we are quite well aware by the 20th time we are watching a Universal product. Why do they constantly screw this one up? Put the theft and ID info on the first disk and leave the rest alone. It irks to no end not being able to bypass all the ""mandetory"" warning labels and such - why can't you just let us watch the episodes?

Yes, two-sided DVDs can be a pain, but the trade-off is having a more disks if Universal were to use single-sided disks. I haven't noticed anything out-of-the-ordinary when watching them - as others have written - and they appear to play just fine for me.

The bottom line is this - don't set your sights too high, and you won't be disappointed. Universal covered the basics, and that's all. But when it comes to Knight Rider, isn't that enough?",1135555200,2,1415,4.348484848484849
2219145,1,B0007LXP5Y,it was ok for one episode but sucked through the rest of the show and it is a copy cat and should be forgotten forever and never remembered for anything I hated this show for a lot of reasons and always will it was so fake that it made me die 3 times and the car never actually could go fast it wasn't even a muscle car it was crap and for one thing The Dukes of Hazzard is way better then this and The General Lee has beat KITT and is way better then some horrible car who talks all the time and thinks he's fast when he can't even go over a 100mph too. The General Lee could beat it any day.,1135123200,,593,3.7903225806451615
2219146,4,B0007LXP5Y,"Season 2 brought alot of changes -- namely April coming in to replace Bonnie ... which I do not think anyone has even bothered to mention?  KITT has some awesome lines in this season as well, especially when it came to Goliath.

As previously mentioned by others, my DVDs have skipped too, I just thought it was my player, since I have never cleaned it.  (Same goes with an episode of the He-Man 10 Best DVD set that I purchased, but I digress).

One thing that has disappointed me, however, is seeing one shot be crystal clear, and then the go to another camera shot, it is extremely dark and/or grainy.  I think for the price, and the fact that I totally disagree with the fact that Universal is being cheap and putting video on both sides, which can increase the chances of scratches and smudges, they could have spent the extra few cents and digitally remastered the video a heck of a lot better, and put all the episodes on Single discs.

To counter Darth Yoda's comment, Willam Daniels, the man that did the voice of KITT ... is *NOT* dead!(...)",1123027200,2,1051,4.447916666666667
2219147,4,B0007LXP5Y,"The 2 Goliath movies are worth buying season 2 alone, and lets not forget the talking car K.I.T.T. Sadly to say the voice of K.I.T.T. died in the late 1990's.  They were planning to bring back David Hasselhoff and a new Knight Rider, but without K.I.T.T. I doubt the series would last very long, plus Devon Miles was murdered, and there is no Bonnie, so what is the point?

2219149,4,B0007LXP5Y,"It's great to see Universal bring this entire series to DVD.  However, does anyone else who owns the Season 2 collection have issues with the discs skipping/pausing in their DVD players?

My player is about a year and a half old, and these are the only discs I've ever had problems with. (aside from scratched rental discs)  I'm getting episodes on both sides of each disc that  mysteriously have choppy playback. (strangely, they are fine in the DVD-ROM)

Any ideas why?  This is actually the second set I've owned.  The first had the same problems and I exchanged it in the store, but to no avail.  Was there a faulty batch of DVDs manufactured by Universal?",1117065600,,660,4.629310344827586
2219150,4,B0007LXP5Y,"This may come off as silly, since the show is centered around a car with A.I., but this season of Knight Rider was awesome in it's chezziness.  In this season we find K.I.T.T. receiving enhancements.  For instance, in one episode K.I.T.T. and Michael have a mission that taks place at the ocean.  Coincidentally this is the same episode that April gives K.I.T.T. an enhancement that will allow him to drive on water.  Of course that enhancement is never tested and is finally used while on a mission.

Next we have an episode in which K.I.T.T. is engulfed in flames.  I guess I forgot to mention that this was the episode in which April equipped K.I.T.T. with a new heat resistance coating.  Again this coating was never tested before Michael and K.I.T.T. needed the enhancement while on a mission.

Finally we have the parachute.  K.I.T.T. was equipped with the parachute enhancement but it was never tested.  You guessed it, Michael & K.I.T.T. tested it on a mission.

I often wonder what might have happened if K.I.T.T. was equipped with the parachute but was on the mission when he became engulfed in flame?  Or, if K.I.T.T. received the ride on water enhancement during the episode he drove off the cliff.  Of course K.I.T.T. received the right enhancement for the right episode.  Also, all these untested enhancements worked flawlessly.  I wonder what would happen if Michael & K.I.T.T. drove off a cliff, hit the parachute button only to find the system malfunctioned?  TV science is a thing to behold!

I am one of the few people that didn't mind April.  I also like Bonnie and am glad she came back in season three.  However, April was treated really poorly.  She was never properly introduced, out of the blue she just shows up as the mechanic and engineer for Knight Industries.  She seems to disappear just as easily.  Here today, forgotten by tomorrow.

Still, Knight Rider season two is a good buy.  The shows really are good and provide a nice break from routine and trials of everyday life.  Also, the packaging for the DVD's has improved from season one.  Now the disks come in slim clam shell cases instead of the wretched fold out booklet that season one came in.",1114473600,5,2182,4.721485411140583
2219151,5,B0007LXP5Y,"One of the more intriguing television shows of the early-1980s, Knight Rider (and K.I.T.T. in particular) captured the imagination of children everywhere while, at the same time, entertaining adults with its effective utilization of a traditional TV action genre. Knight Rider tells the story of an incredible crime fighting team brought together when the terminally-ill billionaire Wilton Knight saves the life of police officer Michael Long after Long gets shot in the face... When the billionaire helps out, providing Long with a new face and a new identity (Michael Knight), the young officer dedicates the remainder of his life to fighting injustice on behalf of the Foundation of Law and Government (FLAG). Singled out by Wilton Knight and aided by the staff of FLAG, Michael is teamed up with an extraordinary vehicle that, if necessary, is capable of fighting bad guys all by itself...

Knight Rider features David Hasselhoff in the role of Michael Knight, an ex-cop turned private crime fighter. But the true star of the show is Michael's car, K.I.T.T. (Knight Industries Two Thousand), a sleek black Pontiac Trans-Am impervious to bullets, fire, or most any type of mayhem. Outfitted with state-of-the-art, top secret Artificial Intelligence, K.I.T.T. is not only capable of self-operation (with his mission to protect all human life), but he's outfitted with smoke bombs, flamethrowers, infrared sensors, and countless other nifty gadgets. Able to verbally communicate with humans, K.I.T.T. maintains a special friendship with Michael, developing his own personality (which at times provides comic relief for the show). Just as criminal outlaws of the early-1980s feared the wrath of The A-Team, the prospect of a visit from Michael and K.I.T.T. certainly caused many sleepless nights for America's criminal element...

The Knight Rider (Season 2) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the two part season premiere ""Goliath"" in which Michael and K.I.T.T. are forced to do battle with Wilton Knight's ex-wife and son who enjoy the aid of a truck sporting many of the same capabilities as K.I.T.T... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Blind Spot"" in which Michael enlists the aid of a blind woman who is the only witness to a corrupt businessman's illegal practices, and ""Speed Demons"" in which Michael and K.I.T.T. are on high alert when an anonymous tipster warns that the upcoming Foundation sponsored motorcycle race will play home to a murder...

2219153,4,B0007LXP5Y,"This show was a guilty pleasure of mine in the early 80s, when I was in my teens.  Buying Season 2 gave me a reminder of KR at its best.  The two ""Goliath"" episodes with Hasselhoff hamming it up mercilessly in an evil part, Ann Turkel's first two appearances where she personifies female villainy at its best, and of course Season 2 I hold in higher regard than the others for the presence of Rebecca Holden as April Curtis among the regular cast (a sentiment that I know is not shared by most KR fans, but I don't care).

If you liked the show and don't remember it too much, you have to get this set for certain, despite the total lack of extras.  KR hit a peak with Season 2 and from then on (especially by the last season) it was pretty much downhill so this is a chance to see the show at its best.",1113696000,3,803,4.095541401273885

The 21 episodes deliver non-stop, never disappointing action! Starting with the ""Goliath"" right through to ""Big Iron,"" Michael and KITT made television fast and furious for its age. Yeah, there are no special features or bonuses in this one, but that's okay with me. I can't wait for seasons 3 and 4 to come out. Especially 4 with Super Pursuit Mode and Peter Parros as RC3.

If you don't like the way Universal released it... don't buy it.

As for selling your copy of season 1... shows how much of a ""true fan"" you are.  Also... as for buying the bootleg issue... I guess you have no problem with stealing then.
