Now, I hate that am giving this less than a 5 star rating, because it is really, really a great work out DVD. But The awkward dance thing between minutes 40-45 is just inexcusable. I treied to play along since I love dancing, but NO. This is an abs workout, what's the point for those 5 wasted minutes? And am not being uptight, I don't mind the playfull bits of dance and fun that Billy brings to his workouts. But when you are so into a workout, sweating up a storm, the last thing you need is silly dance routine that adds no value to the workout.
The good:
You will sweat! No matter what. It's a solid 53 minutes of fun ab workout ( minus the 5 minutes I explained above)
The music is awesome! Crank up the volume and you have a cardio party in your house
The sunny roof top is a nice change from the studio setup
Shelly picks up at the 50th minute for a great 4 minutes run. Most people complain about Shelly but I think she's a great motivation when you want to give up. I have never seen her lead like this before. I wished she had gone longer
The crew at the bottom of the stage working out with you are most familiar faces you'll see in a lot of Billy's dvds
The bad:
That awful 5 minutes. What i do is a round of kick, squats, ground house kicks...anything to keep my cardio going. Works great for me. This was just to give a heads up to those considering buying this dvd to know what to expect

All in all, am happy with this workout. Am a Tae Bo addict and this, I can run for one month straight without getting bored. Am in week 2 already had abs from Bootcamp Abs dvd, just need more definition. Get this, and get creative to get though that dance...",1469491200,2,1759,4.069164265129683
8660474,3,B00KOW4BRW,"I felt that it was a little too long, and there was too much dancing. Also, there wasn't any floor work (crunches, etc....) at all.",1425254400,,131,4.28
8660475,5,B00KOW4BRW,"I started working out with DVD's in the early 90's. Tae Bo was the first infomercial VHS set I ever bought over the telephone. I then got on the subscription to get a new Tae Bo Live VHS each month for $19.99 -- first year was the Basics Live, second year the Advanced Live.  This lead to my current collection of an embarrassing amount of work out DVD's of various types (yoga, pilates, fusions, HIIT cardio, Beachbody sets, barre, etc). I purchased various kickboxing workouts by other instructors and even though I liked them [Janis Saffell and Kimberly Spreen are good], nothing was like the original Tae Bo and Tae Bo Live as far as results.  Not even the Tae Bo Amped, PT 24/7 or Bootcamp series.
Decades, frustrating (Beachbody) workouts, and middle age softness later, I purchased Cardio Abs LIVE. Billy, Shellie and other familiar faces are on a platform on an L.A. rooftop instructing a group of people ready to workout (a big crowd of people of various ages and sizes!).  I thought, it must be super hot on that rooftop.
Then, the music was pumping and telling me to throw my hands up, Billy was getting me warmed up and very shortly, I was having a great time punching and kicking and counting along to 8 in my living room.  This is the Tae Bo DVD I've been waiting for!  The moves are familiar, the music motivating, the tempo doable, and since I'm familiar with this from the 90's Tae Bo Advanced Live workouts, there were no issues for me with the camera panning from the platform to the crowd of people. Then, around 40 minutes in, Billy starts a little dance break for about 15 minutes which was unexpected but so much fun (reminded me of Core Rhythms or Zumba).  Then, Billy asks Shellie if she wants to take the lead and she does for a fun series of punches that work the abs even more (my core and shoulders felt pretty fatigued at this point) and then Billy ends the workout with the usual Tai Chi-ish stretch and some words of inspiration to motivate me to come back and workout again.
I was amazed to see results in my waistline quickly (in about 10 days of doing the workout 7 times) -- nothing has given ME results like this so quickly!  And I have to say, when desirable results start happening, the diet really does clean up on its own and self-confidence really comes back and the WANT and actual DOING of the workout is there daily!  This is my best workout purchase of the year for those reasons and I didn't have to buy it with a lot of other gimmicks or shakes thrown in, it's just me moving in a way that I enjoy. I am so happy and grateful to Billy Blanks and Tae Bo that this Cardio Abs Live workout exceeded my expectations and gave me back something I didn't even know I was missing.",1417910400,3,2720,4.382936507936508
