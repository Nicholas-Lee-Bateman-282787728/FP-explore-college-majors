3415132,5,B0018CWEY4,"Portraying the twists and turns, fates and fortunes of life is what ""Grey's Anatomy"" all about, and with this fourth season this was no different. Some highlights:

- Christina still hasn't coped with the loss of Burke. Her obssession with perfectionism at work is a clear sign of that. Additionally, she has to deal with the tough temperament of Dr. Hahn, Burke's substitute, who just neglects Christina's existence.
- Derek develops a romantic relationship with one of the nurses at the hospital, but he clearly is still in love with Meredith, to the point they seem to get back together in the season finale after a very tough surgery that unites them under the same cause.
- The marriage between George and Callie turns out to be a failure, as well as the relationship between George and Izzie, who both initially thought they had real feelings for each other.
- Miranda's also with emotional issues regarding her marriage, once her devotion to work seems to be bigger than her family life.
- Meredith starts therapy in order to work out her insecurities toward things, especially her shaky relationship with Derek.

These were just a few of them. There's also the relationship between Alex and Rebecca, Lexie and Meredith, Callie and Hahn and Richard and Adelle that would take lines and lines to describe. Once again, this season was just about relationships. Medical cases, as always, are just in the background.

Some people complain they don't know where this show is going to. In fact, it is hard to predict with so many things happening in so different ways. What makes a TV show great is the unpredictability factor. Life is just that way: unpredictable. Things don't work out as planned, sometimes we make choices just to regret later, we do strange things and decisions in moments of weakness. When it comes to emotional issues, there is no logic involved, and expecting this show to be predictable would just ruin the magic it creates. This season is a good addition to fans who already own the previous seasons.",1214092800,7,2027,4.835734870317003
3415133,2,B0018CWEY4,".... with the rest of the fine folks here. What in the world happened to my Grey's? Seriously. What story line? This season was just tragic. Meredith and Derrick, Derrick and Meredith BLAH!!!!!! I wanted to slit MY wrists! Derrick and Rose, Meredith and Derrick kill people, Ava, Rebecca, Ava CYBILL whoever she is. What's with that??!?! Izzie...... I mean really - what story line??? The best she had all year was the pregnant AIDS lady. ONE and I mean 1 marriage seemed to be going okay - Tuck and Bailey and now they can't keep it together.

This was a season full of smut and sleeping around - worse than any season has been. We watched Christina get totally screwed over all season. Addison came in as a breath of fresh air only to leave again. Izzie and George??? Really? Callie and Hahn - forget about it. Just smut..... ridiculous smut. It's as though the writers never planned for the show to succeed and therefore used all their story lines in the first couple of seasons - so now we have Melrose Place in a hospital. It's just disappointing.

Bailey and Christina were about the only reason I stuck around and now that's not even cutting it. LOVE I mean LOVE this show but this season was about as confusing and nonsensicle as this review. So where are we now? George is the Chief's little #$%@&. Hahn and Callie.... huh??? Christina has been pansey-fied and been used to mop up the floor. Izzie - well.... did nothing all season but save a deer and take over the free clinic. The Chief - whined all year and finally got back with his wife. Meredith sought counseling and is now ""fixed"" and ready to be with Derrick......... again. McSteamy - still a horny #$$ but woth morals now?? I just didn't get it. It was once a great show with a terrific cast and an excellent plot line. Now it's nearly R rated fluff with a story thrown in to pass the time in between sheet scenes. It's turned into a really really bad B-rated Porno written by a college freshman for film class. Sorry but it's an opinion. I want my Grey's back.",1213833600,28,2031,4.442359249329758
3415134,5,B0018CWEY4,"After what some fans thought of as a third season flop, Season 4 of Grey's Anatomy brought the show back together with new and exciting plot twists, along with closure of some of last seasons plots. It combines the exact right amount of surgical drama with drama between the staff, inside and outside of the walls of Seattle Grace Hospital. The season, along with the original cast, adds Lexi Grey, Meredith's estranged sister, to the cast as a surgical intern. Anyone who watches this show will not be able to stop. Trust me on this one.",1213401600,2,538,4.614583333333333
3415135,5,B0018CWEY4,"At the beginning i didn't like this season but when it got closer to the final episodes, it reminded me what Greys was all about!!!!!

GREAT GREAT!!!!",1212451200,3,150,4.555555555555555
3415136,5,B0018CWEY4,"Season Four picks up in quality where the show dropped off during the third season. Grey's gets its groove back in a year that re-integrates the brilliant comedic writing and satisfying (yet not over-the-top) dramatic storylines that drew us to this show during the first two seasons.
The departure of Addison Montgomery at the end of season three was particularly saddening as her character added so much to the series. However, the new characters in season four introduce some fascinating unchartered territory for Shonda Rhimes to deal with. Erica Hahn, played by Brooke Smith, adds an interesting dynamic to the season as she replaces Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Her presence threatens Cristina Yang's ego and even has one characters questioning their sexuality. Meredith Grey's sister, Lexie (played by Chyler Leigh), also arrives at Seattle Grace and becomes a series regular in season four. Her presence lays out a potentially interesting story arch for Meredith, as she becomes the first member of her family who admires her and loves her unconditionally. For the first time, Meredith is forced to seek professional assistance in working out her personal issues- the scenes that she shares with her therapist provide some of the most entertaining material of the season.
New relationships are built, old ones crumble, and the staff at Seattle Grace is faced with challenges that deeply affect their lives in a season that reminds us of why we started watching Grey's in the first place!",1210982400,14,1523,5.17004048582996

3415164,2,B0018CWEY4,"Grey's Anatomy was never a great show, but it was definitely a pretty good show. Season 1, episode 1, is phenomenal. From there, the seasons slowly meander downward in quality - with spikes of greatness - until we get here. Season 4.

It stinks.

Everyone ends up sleeping with everyone else. Despite an entire episode being all about chemistry, there's none to be found anywhere on the screen. Each character acts wildly, totally divergent from any personality they might have once had. Relationships are ruined for a cheap giggle. Relationships are formed - and just as quickly broken - because sex! sex! sex!

Pretty people on camera is no longer enough to draw an audience in. Viewers demand more, these days. We no longer believe that the sexy 45-year old male lead needs to get the sexy 21-year-old female sub-lead. We want stories and believability; this season has none of those.

Cristina is de-fanged, suddenly weak and useless.
Meredith suddenly develops suicidal depression and can't be with Derek.
Izzy and George get together in a completely horrifying mis-cast ""relationship"". The two actors, while lovely and talented, have Z E R O chemistry.
Callie, a fantastic character with a ripe backstory, suddenly becomes a lesbian. Presumably to titilate the male fans? Who knows.
The new crop of interns shows up, which is a great chance to add some more relatable characters that aren't just underwear models! ...but that storyline is immediately dropped. Instead, we get boring, whitebread Lexie, half-sister to boring, whitebread Mere... ... zzz...

Whoops, sorry, I fell asleep.

Awful. Skip this season.",1479772800,,1617,5.129277566539924

However, after having watched the first three seasons and halfway through the fourth season, I find the characters to be seriously immature (all of them) and unprofessional. All the patients know everything about the private lives of the interns, residents, and nurses. This is because the characters in the show have no desire to protect the privacy of their personal lives. Not realistic.

The casting is superb ... although I do miss some characters when they are written out (I'm still not over Sloan and Lexie) ... that is how inevested you become in these characters.  My absolute favorite thing is the loyalty the original ""interns"" show each other ... they are family and no matter how they fight, they always have each others backs!  It is an absolutely wonderful time of my week to watch the ""twisted sisters"" and company and then to rewatch seasons on Amazon.",1376352000,,532,4.578947368421052

Sometimes the scenes would even be considered soft porn.  I have enough of an imagination of my own that I don't need to see that crap in my entertainment.  Mostly liked the first season but it went way down hill from there.  I'm done and I only got to season 4.  Could Hollywood please put out something worth our time????",1375056000,,479,4.448275862068965

BUT when I watch on the app on iPad EVERY 5-6 minutes the streaming completely stops and kicks me completely out of the app - I have to log back in, search for show, select show and when it comes back on it has reversed by 30 seconds.  It can take an hour to watch a 43 minute show !!

3415458,4,B0018CWEY4,"Grey's Anatomy, for all of its particular foibles, is a fairly dynamic and usually interesting show that has capable writers and a very strong cast. Season 4 is right around the time that it all begins to unravel--characters stepping out of their particular identities; plots going awry; events that seem increasingly unreasonable--and I think it's probably the last time a casual viewer of the show can simply shrug at what's happening and say, ""Ok, I'll buy that.""

The continued excellence of Sandra Oh and the general smarminess of Eric Dain are the great joys of the show. Watching the dude who plays Dr. Karev continue to be a man-child (while purporting to be a member of an elite surgical unit) and most of the other physicians shrug at their general care duties in favor of doing each other in a dimly lit hospital room is, at this point, a bit tiresome.",1365552000,,863,4.71523178807947

Every season is excellent. You'll find the most well rounded, lovable, and interesting characters on television. And you'll laugh out-loud as much as you'll cry. This series has been made so superbly, and it's one of the only shows that my husband and I both agree on, and that we both look forward to. There's not a person alive who cannot identify with at least one of these characters, and I love that the writers aren't afraid to encroach on an interesting array of subject matter.

3415517,2,B0018CWEY4,"Having never watched Grey's Anatomy before, I decided to rent Season 1 Disc 1 several weeks ago and was instantly hooked. I have since been marathoning through the seasons. I looked up reviews on Season 4 to see if it was just me, or if the acting and story lines had truly gone to hell. I was relieved to read that the writer's strike played a role, and so am regaining hope of recovery in Season 5.

Seasons 1-3 established each character with depth, and Season 4 threw all of it into doubt. Not only were the story lines ridiculous, the actors' personalities became very uncharacteristic and, therefore, no longer compelling or believable. They resorted to juvenile behaviors all around, petty bickering, and lost their humanity as they ravenously hungered for the worst patient traumas like vultures circling over prey.

Yang, one of the most interesting characters IMO, loses her confidence and her aggressive pursuit of surgical practice and becomes a flailing submissive resident who constantly bows her head in shame. O'Malley, formerly sexy with his adorable innocent personality, becomes a total goofball darting about with zero ""swagger."" Stevens, previously the most compassionate and emotionally attached intern, now behaves like a shallow high school girl who could care less about her patients (except in rare moments, when the old personalities and story lines come through temporarily).

Oh, and EVERY patient that EVERY doctor treats codes on the table, which became so predictable I had my fast-forward button under my thumb for these events. They also upped the gore factor - not my idea of better entertainment.

As for the lesbian conversion thing, it could have been an interesting twist if it were - AT ALL - believable. Since it had NOTHING to substantiate either character's inner sexual identity turmoil from the first 3 seasons (apparently written in by the substitute writing staff?), I'm guessing I'm not the only one who found it a pathetic storyline to watch.

If you are a Grey's fan, maybe you will ""tolerate"" this season as I did, half watching while half doing other things, in the hopes that you won't be too lost if/when the next season brings things back to life!

Whew... eesh... and ugh.",1328572800,,2228,4.991913746630728

What I thought was really neat about this set is the 'Season View' option for the discs.  It keeps track of what you have watched as your progress through the discs.  You can stop and start again, even remove the disc and watch something else.  When you come back to the series it remembers exactly where you were when it was last viewed and starts from that point.

The actors do a wonderful job of portraying their roles as well.  The best asset of this DvD are the bonus features.  The behind the scenes footage with the actors is truly entertaining.  I didn't find the extended episodes worth my money.  Most of the scenes are irrelevant.  Season 2/3 have better extended episode footage.  All the Grey's DvDs have excellent bonus features.

Did the network demand more shows? More seasons? Wasn't it suppose to take place over a set period of time? You can only permit so many seasons in that case and that line has been clearly crossed. It's struggling for new plot lines and dumping new characters on the viewers for any reason to stay alive. It's grown as pathetic as Lost.,1235174400,,504,4.372340425531915

the best thing on this season was the addition of Chyler Leigh as Meredith sister, she is beautiful and a great character.
i am watching season 5 and so far it is ok, far for the greatness of season 1,2 and 3 but seems like it will better than the four at least.

Great as usual though I think the characters are getting more emotionally retarded with each episode. It's funny really as Meredith used to be the main character but with each series the others come more into their own and personally, I prefer most of the other characters anyway - I especially like 'the Nazi' - probably the strongest character in the show in my opinion. The thing that sets Greys apart though is the quality of the writing - it's one of the strongest there is now - probably strong enough that a 100 chimps could still make it good if they used them instead of actors - OK, maybe that's a slight exaggeration  but really - the writing is faultless.

3415722,3,B0018CWEY4,"The first two seasons were great! The third season was good too. I didn't think the show would suffer quite as much without the Burke-Yang romance, but it has. I was hoping someone in Hollywood would make amends and bring the Burke character back........oh well! The fourth season is too chick flickish. I understand playing to your audience, but it's a medical drama too. The show has fallen into a drama strickly about women's issues, which are non-ending, complicated and sometimes too much. McSteamy is up to his old tricks, but here's the thing. If he's slept with the entire nursing staff, how come none of them are pregnant? If they're trying depict an iota of realism, someone would've (in his case, a whole lot of someone's) gotten pregnant by now. He's a good-looking doctor. Don't they keep their sperm in some kind of special bank or something?
And what's with the broken speech pattern of the Dr. Bailey character? It's as if everything she's involved with is so profound that she has to ponder some grandiose answer before she speaks. And one more complaint before I get off my soap box. If the show is based in Seattle, how come we don't see more Asians or billionaires in the show? The show hasn't lost it's fizzle but the days of staying up, watching too many episodes in one night are over. I think you will enjoy the series, but not like before.",1224115200,2,1364,4.617283950617284

I will be the first to admit I have never really been in to medical shows, but Grey's Anatomy is a show that has just the right amount of comedy mixed in with just the right amount of drama. Those two things along with the great cast take this far beyond just another medical TV show. The blu-ray of Greys Anatomy season four looks and sounds great, but not as good as Lost season 3. It still looks much better than regular DVD though. Below are the bonus features.

However Grey's has never really been a plot driven show, more focusing on the original cast and their loves, mistakes, dramatic highs and lows, and interactions as they advance within SGH. The sad loss of Addison to her spinoff Private Practice and not so sad loss of Burke after his departure at the wedding are made up for with the return of a strong previously seen surgeon and a new junior member of the Grey clan. I watched all 17 episodes back-to-back which is great with no ads to keep you close to the action and I was hooked all over again. I don't believe in spoilers, so just to say existing fans won't be disappointed and it is worth catching up with Addison in Private Practice if this is your kind of show.

I am impresssed that with the writer's strike, they managed to have a 5 disc set, i was expecting 3 at the least.

I think the reason why half the season was better than the first is due to Shonda Rimes focusing most of her attention back to the show.  The first half of the season, she was mostly in the private practice lot and wrote more there. I just hope she does a better job at multi-tasking for both shows, this upcoming season.

I love Meredith, my fav charactor, she has gone through a lot and now she realize she can't run away from it, and she has to go after what she wants.  The season finale is awesome and loved how everything came at a full circle!

Would I suggest others to get it? It depends on how much  you love grey's, if you've dedicated a lot of time watching greys, then add this to your collection.

I'm still in love with the dialogue, the symbolism that the writers put to the show to make you think, the awesome characters that make up the show.  I'm not that disappointed with the show other than the strike that put a hold onto it for awhile.",1221177600,,1304,4.106299212598425

Alex is just a head case in general and always will be, that is the only interesting thing about his character. Lexi and Meredith, OMG, this story line is really tedious. I want the old Grey's back. Here's hoping it is sexy and edgy and the characters start making better choices in their personal lives so we don't watch and think what a bunch of dumb-a%$#* they are.

The George and Izzie thing should have never happened they messed up the best friendship on the show.  Christina became weak, I honestly don't think she wouldve kissed Hahn's @$$ like that being the strong minded person she was.  I honestly thought Burke shouldve stayed or came back/or hell just replace Isaiah, Christina's personality showed more when dealing with him.  And why screw up Baileys relationship, she had the only one that was being held together, couldn't somebody be a good example.  Hahn, she should've stayed at the other hospital, I thought she was a lesbian from the jump but to put her with Callie, come on! The whole Callie/Sloan/Hahn thing complete smut.  Why! I did like Derek with Rose, don't know why, maybe I was just sick of Meredith, she needed a wake up call and that was Derek leaving for good.  Speaking of leaving for good, Why ADDISON! she shouldve have stayed, although season three they made her weak too, she wasn't the ballsy woman who stepped up to Meredith and said so you must be the girl sleeping with my husband.  Alex and Ava was a definate no for me, but to make the girl psycho just to get rid of the character...not working for me.  I did like the Addison/Alex thing. But why go back to Izzie.  No matter what they do, nothing will compare to Izzie and Denny, they have to make another him for Izzie why would she settle for less.  After the strike the hospital drama got better but the relationship side didn't work, I was happy for the Chief though but it couldve been written better.

Grey's tried to prove its worthiness as a successful series by bringing a large fan base into the fourth season.  This season, however, was a test to the devotedness of its viewers.  Grey's was a few short coming into their fourth season with the loss of Isaiah Washington's character--Dr. Preston Burke--and Kate Walsh's, Dr. Addison Montgomery.  The show tried to compensate the loss by bringing in Burke's rival, Dr. Haun (played by Brooke Smith) and throwing in another twist to Meredith's life--Lexie Grey.  This season's downfall was the entire first half (pre-strike), but admittedly got better as the season progressed.  Is it worth the price?  As a fan (and owner) of the first three seasons, I feel the need to complete the collection.

3415850,4,B0018CWEY4,"After the atrocious 3rd season, which can only be called painful, Grey's Anatomy ditched Isaiah Washington, a dead weight in most scenes in Season 3, with the exception of his excellent scenes with Patrick Dempsey. However, the show lost a lot of energy with the departure of Kate Walsh but manages to recover a little with the addition of Brooke Smith reprising her role as Erica Hahn, who shakes up the hospital in a good way.

The first three episodes are excessively weak, dragging on the silly Meredith and Derek ""broken up"" storyline. However, in ""The Heart of the Matter"" the focus on Callie Torres gives Sara Ramirez a chance to shine and starts an upward incline for the season. Episodes 9, 10 and 11 (""Crash into Me"" and ""Lay Your Hands on Me"") are strong, reminiscent of some of the average episodes of Season 2, especially with the focus on Chandra Wilson's Miranda Bailey. The show never goes wrong with a focus on her and she gives a great performance in ""Lay Your Hands on Me"". Her scene with Patrick Dempsey in that episode is one of the more touching moments in the series, quiet and poignant.

Post-strike, however, the show really took off gaining an energy and focus. Previously meandering, relationships and storylines started to move towards an end point, coming together in an excellent season finale that leaves you wondering where the characters are going to go from there. The strength of the season finale is that the two main cases, Meredith and Derek's clinical trial and the boy encased in concrete, are not based on fast-paced adrenaline but rather slower, emotionally driven cases.

One of the main drawbacks of the season is the underutilization of Sandra Oh. Without having Cristina being constantly punished and ""taught lessons"" in her relationship with Burke, it's almost like the writers have no idea what to do with her and instead have her bouncing around as a prop in the other character's storylines. The finale remedied a little of that, and left us with some hope that Cristina will have recovered enough to be strong in her own right again. Amazing performances by Sara Ramirez, Ellen Pompeo and surprising emotional depth in the last few episodes from Justin Chamber made this a good season for Grey's Anatomy, certainly better than the wholly depressing Season 3.",1218844800,7,2309,4.855329949238579
3415851,2,B0018CWEY4,"I was an obsessive Grey's fan for a long time- i loved the show from the moment I saw the pilot. Season 2, in my opinion, was even better than season 1, but then season three started to drag. Then came season 4. As much as I loved Greys, I stopped watching it after the first few episodes. I've read many fans say here that the show quality got better after the strike, and I did watch the season finale and was happy that the show seemed to be better. But will I watch season 5? No. I'm sorry, but Greys has gotten so melodramatic, and the characters so unlikable that I don't really care what happens to them anymore. My favorite characters, George and Izzie, became almost as selfish and self-absorbed as Meredith, which is truly sad. The other factor was the odd hookups. I knew the writers were desperate when I saw they were trying to put George and Izzie together, and after that relationship started I stopped watching the show. When a friend told me  that Callie had randomly turned into a lesbian I couldn't believe it. Come on! This show was always soapy and over-the-top, but the writing quality was always so strong that those factors didn't matter to me. Sadly, the storylines just became so weak that the things that used to make Greys irresistible eventually made me dislike it.

I can't stand to watch the show anymore.  And the borderline porn scene between Callie and McSteamy was as nauseating as anything I've ever seen.
Really good shows can succeed and be fantastic without resorting to lowly scenes such as that one.  I guess the writers have run out of juice.
No longer a fan and won't bother to buy season 4 because I have no interest in reliving any of what I saw.
And I agree with a the previous poster who said Dr. Bailey was the best character on the show.  Dr. Bailey, Addison(why did she go?), and the Chief were my favs for sure!

The main problem with this season is that the hookups and partner-swapping gets to ridiculous levels, almost as if the writers were trying to put people together until they figured out what worked.  It had the feel of something like 90210, when they had no choice but playing rotating partners with the cast members.

As a result, the romantic issues in the season became trite and annoying.  However, like I said, the finale portends for better episodes to come, so let's hope that happens!",1216944000,4,547,4.913043478260869

Okay, let's be honest this was so not a good season, at least by grey's standards.  The first few episodes were great even though the deer thing was little far-fetched, but ""Haunt Me Everyday"" was an amazing episode and probably my favorite of the season though the finale was great too, definitely season 2 finale status.  As for the bad parts, it nearly wasn't exciting as the rest of the seasons, I was bored for basically episode six before the last two episodes.  The storylines this season were horrible, seriously!  Callie being all weak and sucking at her job because George left was ridiculous, shes a strong women and I didn't really see her behaving that way.  And then she suddenly became a lezbian, which is so dumb.  Callie obviously has no reason to be on the show if shes not with George.  Write her off already(Hahn too, shes just the same).  And once again Mark is just a decoy for Derek, he has no point being on the show either, which is dissapointing because I really liked him too at first. And don't get me started on Lexie!  She is just there to follow Meredith around and be annoying, but I loved that George kissed her in the finale, I see definite potential there but I sort of feel a brother and sister connection. Though, there were some good storylines too.  First, im so glad we got to see Alex's emotional side because i've been waiting forever for this to come, he's not so bad.  Im glad Izzie and Alex got together but Im really mad the way they wrote Ava off because I liked her too.  Did she really have to be crazy?  Really?  Can't someone have a happy ending?  And on that note, im glad that Meredith and Derek finally got together.  Also, I don't know how often I have to say this but the new hookups are so tiring!  One of these days, one of those people are going to die of A.I.D's(not a bad way to write Izzie off, im sure you've heard of Katherines big mouth).  Im not even sure if I want to buy this one.",1216598400,4,1960,4.335164835164835
3415856,5,B0018CWEY4,"In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-3-of-Grey-s-Anatomy/dp/B000P6YNSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season 3 of Grey's Anatomy</a>&nbsp;everything fell apart. Everything that could go wrong did. George and Callie split, Izzie and George made a huge mistake (in my opinion) in trying to make things work out. Meredith feared commitment and Derek wanted to commit. And in the aftermath of Meredith's near death experience, she finally broke down. And then there is Burktina (Cristina and Burke)...which never happened. Like I said, everything that could go wrong did. Season 3 was about breaking the characters, exploring them and making all the mistakes. Season 4 is about mending and fixing those mistakes.

This season started slowly, painfully slow I shall say. The characters seemed stuck, all of them. And try as they might, they were unable and unwilling to change. Then, it happened, slowly, but surely, they started to evolve. They started to look beyond themselves and their problems and they started to grow and mature.

The first half of the season (pre-Writer's Strike) was slow and all consuming within itself; it refused to be bothered with the world around it. The first half of the season brought in a lot of change, but none of the characters were equipped or willing to deal with it. Cristina refused to confront her non-wedding, Meredith was still reeling from her near-death experience and her inability to commit with Derek. Nevermind the fact that she has to deal with a new sister! Izzie and George had to deal with a new relationship and a failed one. Alex had himself and Ava to deal with. We also saw some new characters and some characters leave. All in all the first half of the season was horrible, stale, and unable to foster change.

And then the strike happened, and the creative juices must have been at their peak because what we saw in those 5 last episodes was pure brilliance. The characters finally exploded into full blooded beings in our TVs, they were finally in route to who they are supposed to become and they are finally a testament to what Grey's Anatomy is supposed to be: great, emotional and captivating.

I mark the beginning of the change with the arrival of Addison, she came in waltzing in her Zen zone and her unwillingness to get stressed out and reminded everyone of who they are supposed to be and what they are supposed to be doing, all the meanwhile getting stressed herself. The show then became magnificent; my blas viewing of the show went out the window and FINALLY I became engaged in it once more. The second half of the season was so good that I made every other crappy episode worth it. It even made season 3 worth it because we finally got to see our characters evolve. Thus, whereas Season 3 was the breaking apart of everything, this Season 4 was the mending and evolution of Grey's Anatomy.",1216512000,29,2906,4.99793388429752
3415857,1,B0018CWEY4,"This season was absolutely brutal, as the show continues to sail headlong over the shark. It's become so utterly predictable and just plain bad, without even getting in to the whole ""Gizzy"" thing. No intent to flame the other reviewers here, but I'll just say that TV audiences (through the continuing ratings decline) and Katherine Heigl (comments re: not submitting her name for Emmy consideration) are both with me on this...",1216339200,9,428,5.042253521126761
3415858,4,B0018CWEY4,"Season 4 suffered because of the strike, like many shows.  Although, in Grey's the first episodes of the year were just...blah, a bit of a let down after the previous 3 entertaining and exciting seasons.  But not to worry, it picks up in a BIG way once the writers ended the strike and the season ends solidly and you'll be thankful you hung in there with all the ups and downs.

I, like many fans, was getting sick of Meredith and her whining.  Just when you thought she was going to grow up and stop sabatoging her life...she keeps it up.  But stay tuned till the end of this season!  Same for George and Izzy & Alex & Ava...it was a mess, but by the end things are figured out.  I think part of the reason the first episodes were rough going, was the introduction of several new characters.  By the end of the season we got to know them better and I enjoyed watching them on screen more.  Overall this season started a bit sour, but ended on a high note.",1215561600,21,957,4.214285714285714
3415859,4,B0018CWEY4,"Grey's is great...but the season premiere was pretty silly with that whole Izzie-deer thing, I mean, c'mon, I know it's TV and all, but let's have a little realism. I, too, felt she was pretty flat this whole season, but didn't we just learn that was because she is persuing more film roles (the reason she withdrew her name from the Emmy's).

Meredith and her progression with therapy was pretty cool; even with all her whininess (and her high pitched laughter), her future with Derek looks pretty promising. And who cares about Derek so long as he looks good!!

Callie and Hahn--I agree that's an interesting dynamic, but Grey's has been viewed as the multi-racial TV drama, so why not incorporate the whole lesbian thing too? It's not my cup of tea, but after what Callie's gone through (and Hahn never gave into Sloan's pursuit), that too was a natural progression.

Christina and the aftermath of Burke...you know, at the 3rd season finale, I thought the whole, ""I'm free"" thing was pretty powerful, but we haven't seen really anything more from Christina and how she wasn't herself when she was with Burke--but what HE made her. I think she will have some growth in the 5th season.

George is a bit of a geek--but whatever. Who didn't see him and Lexie getting together at some point?? Hasn't this show made sex with pretty much everyone standard??

Chief and Sloan--supporting characters with little weight this season (I think), but I do believe we will see Sloan's role grow more in the coming season. He doesn't do much but sleep with everyone, but that has to change at some point...?

Alex--I have yet to figure that one out, but Ava/Rebecca has to go away once and for all.

Bailey--our precious Bailey--who I think holds the show together--that was a big bummer about her and her husband, but she is trying to put her family first.

Overall, I believe the season was better after the strike was over and the writers and producers found once again what made Grey's so special in the first place. I believe they set up the end of season 4 for a great season 5....should be great to watch come the fall!!!",1214438400,18,2116,4.63903743315508
