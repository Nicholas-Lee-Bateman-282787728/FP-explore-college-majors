(Small note to point out: This was made by a private Group that did a good job, but the Documentary is leaning more toward a Christain way of looking at the Biblical Lands, rather than a neutral or non-religious way as many Documentaries would normally go. As a rather religious, Jew, I was not completely uncomfortable, but some fellow Jewish customers, might be.)",1393977600,,445,4.792207792207792
7990659,1,B00009ECCY,"I bought this DVD in hopes of getting a good feel for what to expect on my first trip to Israel.  What a mistake.  The DVD is more like someone's home movie of thier vacation to the Levant with minimal editing added in.  It presents very limited information and really is a waste of time and money to view or buy.  I also bought Lonely Planet's ""Israel and the Palestinian Territories, a much better deal for my money!",1187913600,5,418,4.32051282051282
