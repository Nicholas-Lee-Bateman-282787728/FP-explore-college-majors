8180405,5,B000NP46GQ,"First, I just want to say, thank you Master  Liang!!

Snake style forms are rare and beautiful.  A lot of snake techniques have found their way into other styles, such as Tai Ji, and even Young Chun.  Having seem a few forms online, and having once owned a book called The Striking Snake Maneuvers, I have had but a little experience with Snake Style.  I just received and watched through the entire video just now and one of the nice things about this form is that Master Liang goes through many of the  applications so that the student may be able to understand how better to express the form and how to be mindful of its motions.

The next thing that I like about this form is that the wave like motions that I have seen in several snake forms were no longer mysterious to me because I am beginning to understand their function and power.  Something very cool about Snake Creeps Down - which is a feature of Tai Ji forms like Simplified 24 Moves Tai ji, is that the motion is not only subtle, but it is also wave-like and supple - it is cool to see how the Snake style handles a motion without the influence of the Crane!

I also really enjoyed the foot-work.  There is one stance that I have seen several times in other snake forms, but which I don't know the proper name for (if anyone knows - tell me!) that looks like a modified bow stance with the rear leg dragging behind along the ground.  I could easily see how, when Master Liang hops up from the splits, how she could also hop up from this ""drag-leg"" stance, and how she could transition from the splits to this ""drag-leg"" stance and so on.

I also really like the bursts of energy, the grace and power, and the length of the form.  This form also seems to have some very high, very vertical toe kicks and some other unique features.  In any case, I don't know that I can sufficiently comment any more about the video until I give it a try and begin to understand more deeply from doing.  I have a feeling that there is a lot here that cannot be comprehended until the form has been digested and practiced for a sufficient amount of time.",1467072000,,2101,4.283544303797468

8180410,2,B000NP46GQ,"In all honesty, this is an excellent DVD, and Helen Liang is an outstanding performer. The information contained on the DVD is first-rate, and would benefit any WuShu practitioner.

I dislike it is for that very same reason: It's WUSHU. The dancy, no-contact kung fu, the post cultural revolution contribution to make-believe, the Chinese version of LARPing.

If you're a Wushu practitioner interested in the snake form, look no further. This dvd contains everything you need to know. If you're a martial artist looking for insights into this rare, almost extinct style, look elsewhere.",1412294400,4,586,5.223404255319149
8180411,4,B000NP46GQ,"demonstrate the art very well, is to copy well put together they could have added more death meaning more moves of the art over all not to bad",1325635200,,142,4.107142857142857
8180412,5,B000NP46GQ,"Everything in this DVD is wonderful--Helen Liang's technique is simply top-notch.  My only critique is that for those unfamiliar with the snake style, the DVD lacks a step-by-step breakdown of how to execute each phase of the form.  Some of the techniques and postures are rather complicated, and may require extra time and patience in order to be successfully digested.  Don't let that be a put-off for getting this video, however; this program is really a delight once you have put in the time and figured out how to dance the dance.",1295136000,8,535,4.793478260869565
