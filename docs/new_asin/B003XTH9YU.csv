8738806,5,B003XTH9YU,"I watched this movie in a German language English subtitled edition simply because it has Bud Spencer in a cameo role. I was pleasantly surprised that it was an enjoyable movie with an interesting story line about a hitman who felt compelled to explain honestly what he did to his date. There was comedy, adventure, and romance in this movie. I was certainly glad to see Bud Spencer working again, but this movie was good in its own right. I just wish it were available in an English language region 1 dvd. I would settle for just the region 1 part. I recommend it.",1284422400,,565,4.4423076923076925
