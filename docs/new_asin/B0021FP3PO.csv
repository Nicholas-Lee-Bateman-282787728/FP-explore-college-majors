3831883,5,B0021FP3PO,"""Murder She Wrote"" is the best thing that ever happened to TV!  The entire series 1 through 12 is spellbinding.  I have been a devoted fan of this series with Angela Lansbury all through the years.  Now, I am happy to say, I own the entire series on DVD and watch them over and over.  Whenever I want to relax with a good friend like Angela Lansbury I have the entire series to fall back on.  I never tire of any of them.  I have watched some of them as many as three times in one sitting.  They are great!

I would highly recommend the ""Murder She Wrote"" series to anyone who loves mystery stories.  Watch one and you are hooked for life!",1395187200,,639,4.130081300813008
3831884,5,B0021FP3PO,This is another of my favorites.  I have watched this over and over.  I couldn't believe they were going to make this program with someone else playing Jessica.  Never will catch on.  There just isn't anybody else who could carry it.,1394582400,,233,4.609756097560975

3831886,5,B0021FP3PO,"This delightful TV series came out in the 1980s and can still be seen in reruns today.  The marvelous Angela Lansbury plays Jessica Fletcher, small town Mainer and mystery novelist, (who becomes a bit more sophisticated as the series continues).  Ms. Lansbury's performance never varies - it's always excellent - as she takes her warm and appealing character through solving one murder mystery after another.  Why buy the DVDs when you can watch the show in reruns on TV?  because you can tune in any time you want - and not have to watch a single commercial.  Highly recommend the entire series or any portion thereof.",1392940800,,619,4.80188679245283

3831894,5,B0021FP3PO,Typically enjoyable Jessica.  The episodes that take place in Cabot Cove are always the best.  The police should not be the buffoons that they usually are though.,1386460800,,162,4.962962962962963

3831902,5,B0021FP3PO,"I recommend this product to viewers who long for more elegance and less gore in their detective stories.  The plots are well constructed, the  decor is in good taste and Angela Lansbury is a pleasure to watch, even if sometimes her character (like other main characters in other series--- Miss Marple, Poirot, James Bond, etc) is introduced a bit artificially. But, once the plot is launched, it is all suspense and eminently enjoyable.

I am delighted that this series is now available to the public.  I have been looking for it for a number of years. At last, I have the whole series, that is to say a lot of enjoyment ahead of me.",1364688000,,633,4.526315789473684

3831905,5,B0021FP3PO,I love murder mysteries and Murder She Wrote is fun to watch.  It includes mysteries set in locations around the world so it adds a little more interest to each episode. And it is nice sometimes to watch a murder mystery without all the blood and gore we see in the newer shows.,1358726400,,278,4.245283018867925
3831906,5,B0021FP3PO,"This set of Murder She Wrote is easy watching. I enjoy the locations switch between Cabot Cove and NYC and a couple abroad.

3831911,5,B0021FP3PO,"I can't really add anything to the other reviews. Angela Lansbury is great, as always, and the episodes are entertaining. Many times I can figure out 'who-dunnit', but sometimes I can't, so it keeps things interesting. I do kind of wish they didn't have the ""bonus episodes"" from the following season - then you have less to watch the next time.",1330300800,,345,4.672131147540983

3831925,5,B0021FP3PO,"I always have enjoyed ""Murder She Wrote"" and now I have another season in my collestion!
Wonderful stories of murder and a rather reluctant Jessica Fletcher/crime solver/writer, a series that celebrates one womens crime solving abilities when the police and other branches of the law fall short in their investagations. I Love it when her light bulb moments happen and always try to figure out who-done-it with her. I'm amazed somtimes at who the culprit turns out to be. I also get a lot of laughs, that balance out the drama well. Always there to help out a friend in need, set in many locations around the world. Wonderful in my eyes. Something I can watch without all the blood, gore and sexual mess of so many detective programs of today.",1256256000,6,743,4.679389312977099
