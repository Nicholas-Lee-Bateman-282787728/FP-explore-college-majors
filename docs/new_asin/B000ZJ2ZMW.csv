8235668,1,B000ZJ2ZMW,"I was trying to get the movie ""Bear Island"" and this 8 movie pack DVD popped up.  That indicated to me that the movie I wanted was included in the lot.  I tried to find out exactly movies were contained, but with no luck.  ""Bear Island"" was not one of them and I didn't like any of the other movies.  I believe the advertising and lack of info was extremely misleading.",1288656000,74,369,4.154929577464789
8235669,2,B000ZJ2ZMW,"This movie eight pack came up when I entered the name of a movie I was looking for. The description line seemed to indicate my movie was part of the pack. It wasn't. I kept the pack anyway, as some of the titles were good. None of the movies played all the way through, and one won't even load. Poor description, poor quality.",1268870400,48,326,4.190476190476191
