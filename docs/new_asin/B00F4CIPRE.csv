5967425,5,B00F4CIPRE,This is a great series. Dick Van Dyke is such a wonderful actor. You will love this series. You won't be disappointed.,1402617600,,118,4.409090909090909
5967426,4,B00F4CIPRE,"While I definitely enjoyed the series as a whole, and some of the episodes of season 8, it became clear that season 8 was the Van Dyke Family Hour season as fewer and fewer episodes took advantage of what Jesse and Amanda brought to the ensemble to showcase Barry Van Dyke's kids... who, to be honest, mostly fall flat.

However, as this is the final season, it is definitely worth owning to round out the series (especially, now that it's available separately without having to purchase the complete collection.)",1401494400,4,513,4.764044943820225
5967427,5,B00F4CIPRE,"A have-to for those who have waited all these years for the final seasons to be released.  The last season showcases each member of the cast and gives viewers what appears to be an inside look at the loving relationship between father and son, on screen as well as off.  You will relive some of the most exciting and touching episodes if you saw the original series.  If not, you will be sorry this is the last season.",1398988800,9,418,4.333333333333333

5967430,4,B00F4CIPRE,"Enjoyed the shows that I could actually view. Two of the discs were unwatchable  and I have returned the series for a refund. That in no way kept me from watching and enjoying  the rest of the discs. Dickinson Van Dyke was delightful as always. The supporting get cast was outstanding as usual. The guest stars were awesome, I knew almost all of them and their  acting skills shown in the scrilts. I can recommend  series 8 of Diagnosis Murder.",1463616000,,444,4.5125

The first three were good but the last three didn't work. It took 1.5 minutes to load then kept stopping. I'm very disappointed!!!",1432425600,,266,4.680851063829787
5967442,4,B00F4CIPRE,"Dick Van Dyke has been know to have enough charm to carry a series by himself, and this precisely is the case here!
  This is yet another hospital series, but there is absolutely none other like it to be sure, he. is clever, he is smart, and of course he is charming!
the production is quite good enough, and the producers did a good job in bring many of the contemporary performers everybody loves as guest stars in the series, if you enjoyed Van Dyke, and the old TV shows in the past, you are going to love this one!",1430438400,3,519,4.18

5967462,5,B00F4CIPRE,"Always enjoyed Diagnosis Murder and this season is no exception.  The murders are never depicted as grisly as they are on other shows, so the emphasis is on the characters and finding the guilty party.  Diagnosis is always entertaining.",1412208000,,236,5.0256410256410255

8612245,5,B00F4CIPRE,"Dick van Dyke & cast are great. A good combination of humor and mystery. A line for a lady coroner: ""I like working with people."" (dead people)",1520121600,,143,4.333333333333333
8612246,3,B00F4CIPRE,"Diagnosis Murder season eight, in which the series goes out not with style and grace but a whimper, bogged down by nepotism.  At this point, series regulars Charlie Schlatter (Dr. Jesse Travis) and Victoria Rowell (Dr. Amanda Bentley) are seriously downgraded to mere guest stars rarely used.  In their place, they favored Barry Van Dykes children instead, shoehorning them in whenever they could.  Otherwise, the series limped along the same as usual, repeating gags and bits long overused.  Dick Van Dyke is still doing magic, still singing, still dancingall at the oddest times.  Familiarity does breed contempt.",1519603200,,615,5.298969072164948
8612247,5,B00F4CIPRE,Great series. I have 6 of 8 seasons. Very entertaining.,1516924800,,55,4.6

8612250,2,B00F4CIPRE,I've been disappointed with season 8 thus far. It seems to lack the quality of the previous seasons. The scripts in the first four episodes have focused more on the characters that come with each episodes rather than how mark figures out who it is. I'm disappointed with the quality of the show and the poorly written scripts won't buy season 9 due to the fact that it is most likely the same.,1488499200,,393,4.397260273972603
8612251,5,B00F4CIPRE,"Wish shows as good as these would last for yrs, but all good things come to a end, Thanks Dick",1483142400,,94,3.75
8612252,5,B00F4CIPRE,Diagnosis Murder is an excellent program.  Will watch it again.,1477353600,,63,5.3
8612253,4,B00F4CIPRE,"A little disappointed in the ending, still love D.VanDyke and co.",1472428800,,65,5.0
