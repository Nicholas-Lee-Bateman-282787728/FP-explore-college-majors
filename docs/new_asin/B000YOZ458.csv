8233646,2,B000YOZ458,Horrible audio/video.  Spring for something else.  Very disappointed in this product. However... it is possible to watch assuming you already have seen it so you know for sure what you are seeing and hearing.  I gave two starts ONLY because it is watchable.  But just BARLEY!  Spring for a better copy.,1387238400,,302,4.8431372549019605
