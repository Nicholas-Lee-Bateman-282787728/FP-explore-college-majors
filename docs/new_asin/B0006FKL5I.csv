Although I would like to have seen a larger area where Jacob and family probably crossed the Jabbok River, and although the quality of photography was a bit ""older,"" I still gave it a 5.",1468800000,,256,4.565217391304348
8041278,4,B0006FKL5I,"He's a bit nerdy, and its an overview, not in depth, but I got it as a keepsake from my own tour of Holy Land sites in Jordan. I've been to Israel and Jordan, and of course the boundaries of all the layers of history there vary from the current international boundaries, so this helps show some of the pieces of the stories on the east side of the Jordan river.",1446336000,,361,4.098591549295775

the sites in the Jordan Valley and the other sites where Jesus walked.",1304812800,,148,4.6923076923076925
8041280,3,B0006FKL5I,"This program was somewhat less that I had expected or hope for. It does indeed explore biblical Jordan, as the title implies but it does so without much depth. The basic form of the program is that the host tells bible stories that took place in Jordan. While doing so, he walks around some of the sites concerned and shows some scenery. He even gives a bit of brief commentary. Unfortunately, he does not explore anything in much depth. It is all very superficial sometimes.

It must be admitted that the host is passionate about his subject and some of that passion is contagious. Mostly, he seems to desire to tell the biblical story and amaze people with it. As a pastor, I commend him for that; still, I would wish that some of the passion had been directed into more information. Also on the plus side, he does seem to cover each significant site from the scriptures.

This project was apparently a joint venture with the Jordanian government. I think that the Jordanians got their money's worth. It is better than the average tourist tape; I just wish it had been documentary quality.",1120089600,6,1091,4.618556701030927
