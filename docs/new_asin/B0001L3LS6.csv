8013870,5,B0001L3LS6,THE GREAT AMERICAN PAINTER OF LAST CENTURY....THE DVD IS EXCELENT,1404604800,,65,5.6
8013871,2,B0001L3LS6,I bought this hoping to show it to my high school students.  If I ever get really mad at them I just might.  The material is good but the presentation is like a bad college lecture.  I looked at the clock After an eternity of trying to give this video my attention to find that I had only made it through 18 minutes.,1391558400,,316,3.984126984126984
8013872,1,B0001L3LS6,"This video starts off practically midsentence.  Opening screen 'Jackson Pollock' then ""When Pollock lived with Barton....""  What?  Who is Barton and why are you referring to him like we know him?  The writer continues to do this throughout and it's very annoying.  The film shows his body of work (images are good) and the narrators speaks to each of them.  His pronunciation of common English words is off in some cases but the language of the writing is often just pompous and poorly done; words are oft repeated.  The music is odd at best.  When talking about the painting 'War' a single triangle is playing and morphs into a Frenchy accordion piece.  So weird.  I got very little out of this and am thankful that I only have 45 minutes invested in it.",1388448000,,755,4.609022556390977
8013873,3,B0001L3LS6,"I chose this rating because, while I enjoyed the art presentation regarding the artist, there was hardly any footage of the
artist at work or any footage of those times in History. However, I would recommend this video to any art lover, just to
view the beautiful art pieces and style of the artist.",1382054400,,299,4.555555555555555
8013874,4,B0001L3LS6,"Faster and easier introduction than reading a monograph.  Jackson Pollock (Artists of the 20th Century) presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is competent, detailed enough, and quite comprehensive, but only for a person with a solid art knowledge and established art understanding who is immune to the contentious remarks made by the narrator from time to time. Some works considered self-explanatory by the narrator are left without a comment. This documentary includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional work analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good.  The quality of video and sound is good. It has 11 chapters:

8013875,2,B0001L3LS6,"It's rather ironic that such a great painter is covered by such an amateurish film.  The narration sounds like it's being read from a textbook.  More often than not, it does not even seem to correlate with the painting being shown.  It does not help that there is no on-screen text identifying the paintings, let alone dates or medium.  The music seems haphazard, ending abruptly, mid-phrase, at the end of the film.
The only positive of this film -- the reason I would not give this film a 1-star rating -- is that the images of the paintings are very rich.  In fact, all you see are the paintings.
Not knowing anything about the filmmaker, my impression is that this is a film made by an art historian so deep into the subject matter that he does not know when he's being rather obscure in his references.  My (unfair) hunch is that he made this himself on his desktop computer.
Overall, the film left me confused and amused.  Next time I watch it, I will put on the radio or a CD, play some nice music, and just watch the DVD without sound.",1084233600,13,1043,4.373056994818653
