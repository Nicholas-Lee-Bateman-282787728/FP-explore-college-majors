6412168,4,B00KB0OAAU,"Varsity Blood has gotten plenty of lesser than kind reviews, and after having just watched it I don't understand why. Sure, it's not one of the best slasher movies ever made. And it's not even the best slasher to be released this year (that honor would probably go to Jersey Shore Massacre). However, it is better than a lot of slasher movies I've seen. It has a pretty good killer, a decent body count, some t & a, and gore. What is doesn't have is a sense of humor. It's played mostly serious, which doesn't exactly help. And the last half of the film takes place outdoors at night, so it is pretty dark. Still, this is a better than average slasher and fans of slashers should definitely watch it!",1409356800,,700,4.392307692307693
6412169,2,B00KB0OAAU,"This is another teen high school slasher who-dun-it. Head JV cheerleader Ginny gets killed on Halloween and now after one year it is Halloween again. The movie gives us the usual suspects: the father of the victim who goes missing, the unstable boy from the half way house is gone, the kid who wears the mascot costume is gone, Hanna's ""Carrie-like"" mom,  the boy who is picked on by the cheerleaders....everything but the creepy janitor. How could they miss him?

The movie gives us all the comical cliche suspects with a straight face. They should have played some ""Psycho"" stabbing music when they mentioned each one, and turn this into a rightful satire.

The acting was bad. However I think a special shout out needs to go to  Elyse Bigler who played Heather. She was comical as she read her lines worse than a first year drama club type. Unfortunately the film didn't get any better after they killed her (oops sorry) but I felt better.

Not a great slasher. No real comedy value unless you want to play MST at home.

6412170,1,B00KB0OAAU,"Now with a line like that, how could you go wrong?!  I must say,...I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a serious horror movie, or a spoof horror movie.  It's honestly like the casting director called all the agents and asked for their absolute WORST actors they had.  There were times when it was so bad I had to rewind it just to watch it again and make sure I wasn't imagining it.  Be that as it may, I REALLY liked the ""look"" of the movie.  It felt like I was watching an old school horror flick from the 80's.  Not sure if they used film or some type of filter on digital, but that was about the only thing I liked.

It's your typical generic story.  Super popular high school cheerleader dies in a freak accident and everyone blames everyone else. You know who the killer is going to be the whole time even though they try to sway you.  It doesn't work.  Much like EVERYTHING in this movie.

Final Verdict:  STAY FAR AWAY from this one!",1409270400,2,945,4.188888888888889
6412171,1,B00KB0OAAU,"Simply put, this movie has zero redeeming qualities, outside of perhaps some unintended humor at the absurdity of the acting and dialogue. Same plot that's been done a billion and a half times: a bunch of high school kids have a party and there is a masked killer on the loose, taking them out one by one.

While I appreciate what they were going for here, a kind of ""Varsity Blues"" meets ""Friday the 13th,"" the cast was too weak and the script was too bad to pull this movie over the line of respectability. I can't even recommend this one to fans of the low budget, indie horror film, as there are no scares and about 15 minutes into this movie you'll begin to kick yourself for buying or renting it in the first place. Avoid this clunker at all costs.",1408838400,2,754,4.309859154929577
8657113,2,B00KB0OAAU,Lets be straight A head cheerleader gets killed in some accident then A year later someone starts killing everyone that was there. Like nobody doesn't see that coming there's one cheerleader that gets it in the school showers I what is she doing taken A shower when the school closed and the main murder weapon an ax or something that looks like one.  But when its discovered who the killer is and why that takes the cake.,1464307200,,422,4.48051948051948
8657114,5,B00KB0OAAU,"I have been a fan of horror movies practically my entire life, and in particular, those of a slasher variety. I absolutley loved Bloody Homecoming, and was excited to take a look at the sophmore effort. I have NO idea how in the world this got some low reviews. Look, this movie delivers on what the basic formula is for this type of film. A nice, fun throwback to the days when these were being churned out in the 80's. The movie devotes time to character development and has plenty of nods to classic slasher lore (in particular, Friday the 13th). The atmosphere is cool, the music is well suited, the killer is masked, and when the kills begin to happen (this has a good body count), the practical f/x are well done. Some of the dialogue made me chuckle, and again, I found this kind of effort to be rewarding. It's a low budget, indie gem that is FULL of heart. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, because imo, it checked all of the boxes. Kudos Mr. Helgren, hope to see more of these types of films in the future.",1425081600,,1016,4.296875
8657115,4,B00KB0OAAU,"Loved this slasher flick, I was a huge fan of the other flick Helgren worked on called Bloody Homecoming too! This had a fun 80's plot with 90's slasher sensibilities, I don't know why all the negative reviews for this one...its quit fun. The killer has a unique costume and the kills are great, I say if you are a fan of slashers give it a whirl!",1423353600,,347,4.1940298507462686
8657116,1,B00KB0OAAU,"Pathetic and dreadful slasher movie about a bunch of high school students at a very small Halloween party who are targeted by a killer dressed as the team mascot.  The whole concept of showing, not telling was completely lost on the makers of Varsity Blood which is surprisingly talky but not very gory or suspenseful.

Where to start?  The terrible thing that happened the year before that might be inspiring the murders?  It's brought up in a hard to follow conversation rather than shown at the beginning of the movie like a classic slasher film.  The escaped mental patient who may be the killer?  His escape is mentioned in detail along with his recent medical history on a long radio call from the dispatcher to the local sheriff.  Near the end of the movie the heroine rips the mask off the killer and asks why he did all this.  He says do you want a list of reasons?  Then, believe it or not, he proceeds to provide a list of reasons.

At one point the teens come up with a plan--two will run away and act as a diversion to draw the killer's attention while a second couple makes for a nearby truck.  But the couple who are supposed to go for the truck proceed to have a loud argument as soon as they are outside so the killer never even goes after the couple acting as a diversion--and that couple runs pretty far away without ever realizing that the killer never actually followed them.

Varsity Blood probably has the talkiest characters you will ever see in a slasher film but the dialogue is mostly terrible and at times it goes on for so long you get the sensation of listening in on conversations where you have no idea who or what anyone is actually talking about.  The killer makes virtually no effort to kill the characters because they tend to be too stupid to fight back or run away.  There doesn't seem to be even a single  attempt to generate suspense at any point in the movie--it's just talk, talk, talk then some badly filmed murders, which seems to be the only way to shut most of these characters up.

This is such lazy garbage the people who made it should really be embarrassed.  Even bad 1980's slasher films have more ambition than this--something like Don't Answer the Phone or Hell Night look like masterpieces next to Varsity Blood.",1422403200,,2266,4.487804878048781
8657117,2,B00KB0OAAU,"Typical slasher film but with a cast of teenagers so one-dimensional they might bore you to death before they get butchered. The first half of the film, which sets up the slash party, moves so slowly and dully that you'll find yourself screaming at the screen, ""Hurry up and slaughter them already!"" After that, you really don't care much who dies, who survives, and who's behind the mask. For fans of the genre only, and even they will shrug their shoulders and say, ""Meh"" at this one.",1422057600,,486,4.597701149425287
8657118,1,B00KB0OAAU,"Terrible rubbish. Lame script, cookie cutter slasher with a Scooby Doo ending. Avoid.",1419638400,,85,5.615384615384615
8657119,1,B00KB0OAAU,"I had to warn the world about this movie....it is so very bad. The story is typical, but not even good typical. I can guarantee that none of the ""actors"" in this ""movie"" will ever amount to anything. Some are really bad and some others are worse. Any Academy Award winners in the bunch...not a chance. I will, however, bestow Best Abs to the character of Blaine as played by Blair Jackson. His abs did rock. The mother? she and her boyfriend are absolutely the worst....I'm begging you to not even consider this train wreck.",1413244800,,524,4.526315789473684
8657120,2,B00KB0OAAU,"Varsity Blood started out promising but most of the acting was so annoying it was sometimes hard to watch. It had everything I usually like in a formulaic slasher,a motive and back story from the killers point of view. Some good kills and a creepy setting filled with all the typical slasher flick teen stereotypes .

Even with all that in place it just didn't hit the spot. If your characters are annoying and can't act that's a wrap unless of course they're playing it for cheese appeal with one hysterical one liner after another. Unfortunately for Varsity Blood it took its self way too serious and didn't go for a more its so bad its good approach.

There were a couple of performances that were pretty good but I won't go into which ones. All in all this was a missed opportunity that could have,with a little more effort been acceptable.",1411516800,,844,4.546052631578948
8657121,5,B00KB0OAAU,Perfect throwback to 80s horror. I LOVE this movie!!!,1411344000,,53,5.0
8657122,3,B00KB0OAAU,"The name for this movie should have been all cheerleaders must die but since that title was already taken we get varsity blood. Will this movie change the horror genre,no but iit is still a fun little horror movie. Basically if you like Friday the 13th you will like this movie. On halloween the cheer squad and their jock boyfriends are partying and an accident leads to one of the cheerleaders death the next halloween someone has not forgotten and is killing the squad and the boyfriends off one at a time. Is it the boyfriend of the chick that got killed who is now in the loony bin?,s it the principal father of the dead chick? Or is it someone else? Plenty of gore,plenty of chicks in their bra and panties and one topless nude scene. Fun little horror movie, I recommend varsity blood for a watch on a Saturday night. I got this at walmart for $9.96. Other reviews where harsh and dead wrong,what did they expect from a low budget horror movie.",1410566400,,951,4.44
