You can go at your own pace, and do the exercises over and over again until your satisfied you have it right. She is one of my favorite art instructors. She has written quite a few books. I have several of her books, and I found them to be great too. I believe you will be happy with this purchase.",1443052800,5,400,4.207792207792208

7795626,3,1440334188,I think if you are a beginner in drawing this DVD would be good for you. A lot of this I already knew. But I think that Trudy Friends books or DVDs (if you can get them) are better.,1393891200,,181,3.6666666666666665
