Rob Jones

The Doors formed in 1965 in Los Angeles with a line up of Jim Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (keyboards), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums). Until the untimely death of their iconic lead singer in 1971 this four piece became a leading lyrical, musical and performance entity and, their star still shines brightly many years on.

A lustrous legacy has left a cause for celebration and carrying the baton with this ideal are UK based tribute group-The Doors Alive. This quartet is a European combo because its parts consist of a Dutchman, a couple of Hungarians and a Yorkshire lad. This make up alone confirms the global impact of their inspiration-and, a July 2016 show at The Acapela Studio, Pentyrch displayed that The Doors Alive do justice to a batch of illustrious tunes.

A selection of material that propelled the 60s icons to fame was also accompanied by several stage favourites that did not feature on studio albums but did crop up on live recordings. A two half set afforded quantity and quality-and, the interval had the players mingling freely with their audience.

It was not a surprise that a phenomenal, elongated Light my Fire was the top of the crop-and, the musicians earned their corn with a show of dexterity and durability. The career of The Doors was traversed and other renowned favourites such as Break on Through (To the other Side), Backdoor Man, Riders on the Storm, Five to One, Strange Days, Roadhouse Blues, LA Woman and The End led the pack of pristine pop. The respective lights of the aforementioned numbers will always shine bright-but, even some of the more obscure offerings hit the spot because this 2016 incarnation really replicate the rhythms with a potent, polished, and professional application.

21 year old Holland export Mike is a newer addition-but, The Doors Alive has not suffered because the looks and moves of the new incumbent offer a well studied portrayal of The Lizard King. The rest of the outfit also adopt key roles and in particular the nuances of Norbert paid testament to the momentum of Manzarek (who sadly passed away in 2013). Elsewhere, the beats were kept in check as each segment of this whole ensured that the standards did not drop-and, it is evident that these guys have clearly done their homework.

In the intimate settings of Acapela (which was once a church) The Doors Alive had a crowd in their faces and also looming from the gallery-so there was nowhere to escape. The aural attraction were put under pressure from certain adoring punters laboriously filming, jumping on stage and getting in they way of proceedings. Nonetheless, full credit to The Doors Alive for keeping their cool and delivering the goods.

When the Musics Over and it is time to leave everyone in attendance had been entertained and taken back to a period where The Doors were pioneers. Meanwhile, in the context of this unique venue it was even more of a treat to savour those seminal songs.
When it comes to honouring heroes The Doors Alive are kings of the highway!

Therefore, you have the original back catalogue of those lustrous long players and seminal singles. You have seen the Oliver Stone movie. you have read the many books. You have witnessed the tribute act. So what else can you do to bolster your experiences of this awesome act? Well, The Doors from the Outside DVD and its 139 minutes of analysis and action is an essential produce! A thorough account of the story of Morrison, Manazarek, Krieger and Densmore is cut apart and pieced together to form a tapestry of the tunes and a collage of this combo. Fabulous footage and scores of interviews including a hook up with Pamela Kennealy Morrison, widow of Jim makes for a pristine package. The Doors live on and their legacy can be seen through an array of acts-so, if you want to learn more about the roots, rhythms and roles of the primary parts of the whole get on the inside with From the Outside.",1474675200,,3965,4.766763848396502

8344175,3,B001UL7SOO,"Overall the story was interesting and input from people who ordinarily aren't too familiar to Doors fans. The only dislike was from this so called Mrs. Morrison, in her mind. Iv'e read the book by her, Strange Days, was not impressed, and most of what she has to say is difficult to believe. So, other than Patrica Kennealy, the Dvd was enjoyable and many people not familiar with The Doors would find it interesting. Hardcore Doors fans maybe not as much.",1360713600,2,456,4.6419753086419755
8344176,3,B001UL7SOO,"""The Doors from The Outside"" is a documentary released last year that has interviews with some of the people who were able to objectively view (in most cases) The Doors from the outside of their circle. Interviewed are mostly rock journalists who were around when The Doors were actively recording and performing.

""The Doors from the Outside"" goes through the recording history of The Doors with a nice amount of time given to each album with the journalist's commenting and critiquing The Doors albums. I found the critiques to be insightful and whether I agreed with the assessment or not that they were well informed assessments. The DVD runs a bit over 2 hours and includes archival footage of The Doors that the box says ""is the rarest footage..."" Most of the footage is known, I only noticed a few rare things or things I haven't seen before towards the end. But the centerpiece and attraction of the DVD are the interviews. People such as Richie Unterberger, Billy James, Richard Goldstein, Robert Christgau, Johnny Rogan, James Riordan, Doug Sundling, Marc Benno and Patricia Kennealy. Some of the interviews are superfluous, only needed to establish the early history of The Doors. Some are insightful and thoughtful, Richard Goldstein being an outstanding example. Marc Benno, who played guitar on L.A. Woman, has some surprisingly insightful remarks about Jim Morrison.

It does tease the panel discussion from the Critique show that The Doors did in the aftermath of the Miami incident, it isn't shown. As far as I know that panel discussion moderated by Goldstein and with Patricia Kennealy, Al Aronowitz, and Roscoe (a DJ) has never been seen. I think it's something Doors fans would like to see. Why it wasn't included on The Doors Soundstage I'll never know or understand.

This DVD does feature Patricia Kennealy rather prominently. Not only is she included in the interviews of the main body of the documentary, but she's the highlight of the special features with an interview in which she's pontificating on all things Morrison. Billed on this package as Patricia Morrison, Kennealy is a lightening rod in The Doors community. Whether you believe all that she says or take it with a grain of salt what she says, it's up to the viewer to decide.

Overall it's a nice package. Maybe something that's not a must have for fans, but something that will interest fans and adds to the collective knowledge of The Doors.",1286323200,4,2433,4.912408759124087
8344177,5,B001UL7SOO,"I can see why some people may not like this documentary. It's dry and British. Yet,it's a wonderful look at what the critics,then and now,think about their music. In 1971,the psychedelic tide had ebbed out. And left many bands ,high and dry. The Doors' music lives on and is still able to find new listeners,generation after generation. This documentary is slow and almost scientific in its approach to explain the 'Doors' influence. If you are a die-hard fan,you'll love this DVD.If you wanted a lot of music,you'll be disappointed here. The Doors were one of the few bands,that was able to ride the vibe and survive,with its unique Blues/Jazz/Hard rock sound. The lyrics were poetic and erudite. And still perfect for Top 40 radio. Oliver Stone's film was entertaining,yet only about thirty percent accurate. And most friends of Jimbo agree that the Lizard King would not have been happy with the film. This documentary also closes with the ambiguity of Morrison's death. Almost all agree his health was poor,so his death was not that big of a shock. But,his Parisian friends felt his health and mood was improving. I feel Morrison was set-up,perhaps by the CIA.Jim's father was a big-wig in the navy,and serving in Vietnam,during the Doors successful launch. Ironically,the Doors were the most popular radio music,over the GI air-waves. Jim having felt distant from his parents,claimed they were even 'dead'.Jim's death has always been shrouded in mystery. I think a pausible story is that the CIA,were closing in on Jim and Pamela Courson. Jim's soul-mate and anima gemella,Pamela,operated a successful L.A. fashion shoppe. While at the Left Bank,Pam sent Jim to pick up some 'packages' for her,at the Rock-n-Roll Circus discotheque. When Jim arrived he encountered the two drug couriers was soundly roughed-up by the two dark-clothed dudes and left in the loo. Jim was helped out,by fellow clubbers, and taken back to his flat. They put him in the bath-tub. And Pamela was then faced with a huge dilemma. If she called the police,her involvement with the drug-dealers would be fully exposed. Whether quick medical attention would have revived him is unknown. Jim expired in the tub,and she needed to have the body quickly interned,before the police became suspicious of 'foul-play' and 'drug-connections'.She was able to have the death ruled 'natural',within two days. Most believed it because of Morrison's depression, bloated frame and declined state of health. This documentary doesn't mention this version,yet does leave the window open to various possiblities of his final where-abouts. This documentary is a must for every true fan of the 'Doors'.",1274313600,14,2658,5.183720930232558
8344178,1,B001UL7SOO,"For such a ""talented person"", she seems to continue to capitalize on her ""marriage"" to Morrison.  Guess she didn't make enough money on the book she wrote under her ""married"" name.  Like the other reviewer indicated - its been almost 40 years - how much more information can there be and can anyone trust the ""memories""?  Lets just enjoy the fabulous music of the Doors and videos.",1270080000,2,381,4.656716417910448
