8017836,4,B0001XAP0G,"In La Marca del Zorrillo(1949, The Mark of the Skunk), Tin Tan/German Valdes plays a swashbuckler swordsman who battles Spanish troops in Old California. Tin Tan also plays his lazy-eyed, on screen father. This film spoofs classic Hollywood movies like The Mark of Zorro and The Adventures of Robin Hood. There's also anachronistic humor such as people in the 19th Century dancing to swing music! A young Silvia Pinal was quite lovely and sensual as Tin Tan's love interest. This film is six decades old, but it's more entertaining than most of the movies coming out of Mexico nowadays.",1265673600,,586,4.929292929292929
