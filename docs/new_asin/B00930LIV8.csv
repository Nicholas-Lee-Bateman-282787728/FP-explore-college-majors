5251203,5,B00930LIV8,"Thomas is a long - standing favorite in our house.  My four - year old son goes through phases where he wants to watch it all day every day!  We just went to Day out With Thomas a few weeks ago so he is definitely on another Thomas kick making this set's arrival perfect timing!

What's better than a new Thomas DVD?  FOUR new Thomas DVD's!  This set includes ""Calling all Engines,"" ""Come Ride the Rails,"" ""Tails from the Tracks"" and ""It's Great to be an Engine.""  It also includes a bonus poster map of the Island of Sodor!  I think this was actually my son's favorite part because it was something new and different and game him a visual of the home of the beloved Thomas and his friends.

Each DVD has several short, ten - minute episodes.  This is great for kids of all ages.  The really young ones can't sit for more than ten minutes and the older can just watch them all! As a mom I love Thomas not only because my son loves him, but because it's clean fun, has great lessons and creates thought provoking discussions.  My son is at the age that he asks me questions after he sees something wanting more information.  It's much easier to discuss hard issues when it's his idea and comes from Thomas instead of me!

With bonus features on each disc and a fun map, this four DVD set is quadruple the fun for any little boy on your Christmas list!",1354147200,2,1350,4.267716535433071
5251204,5,B00930LIV8,"If you are a Thomas the Train fan this is a great DVD set that your family will enjoy and if you are new to the series, this is a great set to start with. With so many fun episodes you will have a blast sharing this with your kids and your kids will be coming back asking for more and more (or at least my youngest daughter did). I have always enjoyed the Thomas the Train series, not only because of the writing of the series or the animation, but instead for the messages that it shares with children about friendship, hard work, dedication and so much more. It is these messages that make me bring my own children back for more and you will too!",1352246400,,648,4.110236220472441

8534950,1,B00930LIV8,"These DVDs say copyright 2012 and the cover picture looks like the more modern, less harsh looking Thomas stories, but the  actual stories are the older Thomas ones.  I am disappointed and will be sending these back.",1419638400,2,216,4.8108108108108105
