6698444,2,B00O1D37JS,I found this DVD to have weird exercises and little explanation. I was concerned at times that I might hurt myself by doing some of their moves. If you can't pick up stuff fast you'll be frustrated. Some of the exercises I found down right bizarre. I did like that you can pick the areas you want to focus on and then play that selection whether its 2 selections or more its nice to be able to customize.  I'm a fan of Exhale Core Fusion DVDs - Fred & Elizabeth. This is not even close.,1420070400,6,486,4.11578947368421

6698520,5,B00O1D37JS,"This is a pretty good workout.  You have lots of options and ways to mix and match.  No extra affectations (like a stupid balance ball) to distract you from exercise, which is the point.  I'd recommend this to anyone at any level, especially if you want to workout every day and don't always have a lot of time to do it.  I like the instructor too.",1430438400,5,348,4.2272727272727275

8681295,5,B00O1D37JS,This is a really great toning/ resistance workout. I love the convenience and versatility of the dvd since you can customize how you want to use it each time and the pacing of each segment is perfect. I've only been using this for a couple of weeks and I can feel and see results. It's really nice to have some new moves in my routine.,1531872000,,335,4.1692307692307695

8681300,5,B00O1D37JS,"I wish all of my exercise dvds were as good as this one...and I've got 'em all! Each exercise move is done in its basic form, then increases to intermediate difficulty, and finally, advanced. The instructor stays in the intermediate mode while one back-up stays in the beginner mode and another back-up in advanced. There is lots of variety and they don't stay on any exercise for a (boringly) long amount of time, which is my biggest peeve with Jillian Michaels. They also don't repeat a sequence, ala many other dull, repetitive exercise videos. Well done, Weight Watchers!",1504224000,4,575,4.877551020408164
