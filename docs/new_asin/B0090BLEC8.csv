I came to appreciate their culture even more after watching the series.  I bought it during a trip to Singapore and Malaysia, so I don't know about the English translations in this one.  However, it is worth watching if you love history and enjoy learning about different cultures.  It also has the added love story.  The cinematography, costumes, makeup, hair, etc was excellent!!  I can't wait to watch Part 2!!",1371168000,2,582,4.592233009708738
