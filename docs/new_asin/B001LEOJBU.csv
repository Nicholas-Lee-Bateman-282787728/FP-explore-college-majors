8317981,5,B001LEOJBU,"TNA Victory Road 2006 was another solid PPV from TNA in 2006. 2006 was an exciting year for TNA as The Icon Sting came out of retirement after five years. Christian Cage jumped to TNA from WWE to become a major player in TNA.

  Johnny Devine (with Alex Shelley) defeated Shark Boy. Average match to start the show. Good showing by Devine.

 The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas) (with Shane Douglas) defeated The Diamonds in the Rough (Elix Skipper and David Young) (with Simon Diamond. This was a great match The Naturals needed to get back on the winning track and this was a big match for them. Elix Skipper and David Young had a good showing too. Skipper is a very underrated wrestler. It was an entertaining solid tag match.

3  Monty Brown vs. Rhino. I was not happy with this match as it was too short and ended in a no contest. This could have been a great match had the powers to be allowed it to go longer and gave a winner. Both wrestlers are great so what I saw I liked it was just too brief a match. I like Monty too bad he didn't pick up the win.

4  The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez) (with Konnan) vs Sonjay Dutt and Ron Killings This was a solid bout. LAX were just starting to work their way up the ranks to the TNA Tag team title contention and matches like this showed they were serious threats to the TNA tag team titles. Dutt and Killings had a great showing. Dutt one of the more forgotten and underrated wrestlers in TNA. He was a pretty solid worker. Killings had been the world champion before so he added his talents to this match and made it even better. This was a good move by TNA to put in one of their best workers who hadn't been used much to help support the show.

5  Senshi (c) vs Kazarian This was a awesome match. Senshi is one of the best X-division wrestlers of all time. With Joe, Styles and Daniels moved to world title and tag team picture the X division was for the taking and no surprise Senshi stepped up and grabbed the prize ring. Kaz was always a great wrestler and these two put on a classic. Kaz went on years later to have one of the best matches in TNA history with Christian in a ladder match. Senshi of course would go onto have countless awesome matches. We see here in 2006 that these young guys are on their way to taking the step up the ladder. Kaz was promising and he really developed into a hell of a wrestler.

6  Raven vs Larry Zbyszko  Hair vs. Hair match.  This was a very short match and still fun. Any card with Raven on it will be solid. Raven when he came to TNA made it legit and helped it grow having the greatest match in TNA history in 2003 against Jeff Jarrett for the NWA title. It was too bad with the inclusion of Sting and Christian Raven's role in TNA diminished. But he had a great run in 2005 with the world title and his matches with Jeff Hardy. Still great to have Raven on the roster but it would be better for him to be working with a young talent to help put them over.

7  Chris Sabin and Jay Lethal vs The Paparazzi (Kevin Nash and Alex Shelley) (with Johnny Devine)  Fun match we had three of the greatest young stars in TNA in Sabin, Lethal and Shelly. Of course we had the great Kevin Nash in there too. I often wonder if it wasn't for his injuries if he would get a serious title run with the World title. The rumor was he was booked to beat Jarrett at Bound for Glory. Instead he got hurt and Rhino took his place. Nash was great in mentoring the young X division wrestlers and just being entertaining. For the match it was great. Three of the best young rising stars in TNA at the time in a solid match.

8  The James Gang (B.G. James and Kip James) and Abyss (with Father James Mitchell)  vs Team 3D (Brother Ray, Brother Devon and Brother Runt) This was a great match. Team 3D always can carry the ball to a great match. Abyss is great as always as the monster. The James Gang still had something left in the tank as they were nearing the end of their careers. It was great to see Brother Runt back in wrestling. He did a great job and was a welcome addition to TNA. It might not have done what he did for ECW in the 90s for them that he did for TNA in 2006 but he was still a great wrestler and good addition to the roster helping satisfy the hardcore fans.

9  Sirelda, A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels (c)  vs Gail Kim and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm)  Six-person Mixed tag team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship

  Great match. AMW and Styles and Daniels had some great wars. Their best match being at Slamiversary. The inclusion was Gail Kim was great as she is one of the greatest female wrestlers of all time. Most of her time in 2006 was a managing role which she was great at. I liked her as the manager but she was great for the womens wrestling in TNA. Styles and Daniels were really starting to gell as a great team. AMW of course has to be the greatest tag team in TNA History. In 2002 from then on when the company started they carried the tag team division. When you see great matches like this it's too bad AMW would break up.

10  Sting defeated Scott Steiner, Samoa Joe and Christian Cage  Road to Victory match to determine the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship

  This was the best match of the night. We knew who was going to win but we still wanted to see that happen. It was exciting to see Joe finally get in a big main event match with some of the established stars. Steiner at the time still had a lot left in the tank after his disappointing WWE run you wish he went to TNA in 2002 instead of WWE. Cage put on a great showing as I think TNA should have given him a longer run with the title in his first run. But they needed The Sting Jarrett angle to conclude. As for Sting this was his big match and he proved he still had it at 47. It was one of his biggest wins in 2006. Great match.

  In conclusion this dvd runs about eight dollars or less on ebay or amazon. I think its worth it. Pretty solid card and a must for any Sting fan. 2006 was one of the most exciting years for pro wrestling and TNA was looking awesome. With Joe moving to the title picture things were looking like they were headed in the right direction. Sting was doing everything he could to make TNA a known brand. And this was a breakout year for Cage as he showed he could be a mega star when given a chance. Cheers and enjoy!!",1420848000,2,6421,4.161681487469685
