8708859,5,B00UZSLDO4,Excellent series - not seen the English version but this is definitely worth watching,1481760000,,85,5.142857142857143
8708860,5,B00UZSLDO4,"Absolutely outstanding. Brilliantly scripted and acted, this series presents a thoroughly believable view of a potential alternate present that shows in many ways how far we've come--and how far we haven't. I bought a multi-regional DVD player exclusively for this series as it is not available is U.S. Format, and believe me, I am NOT disappointed. The only thing that dismays me is that season two is thus far unavailable with English subtitles.",1464220800,4,447,5.136986301369863
8708861,5,B00UZSLDO4,Better than the remake. Grittier. Some excellent performances overall. I'm anxious to see the second season.,1445299200,6,108,5.8125
8708862,5,B00UZSLDO4,"This is the English-subtitled version of Real Humans, the show that started it all and has been sold to numerous countries for remakes (such as Channel 4/AMC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Humans/dp/B010O43Z8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Humans</a>). The release on this web page, the Australian pressing of kta mnniskor, was the only one I could find with English subtitles (I got mine on ebay). It's Region 4 disc format, so of course be confident your player can handle that before dropping $50.

Here's a quick comparison of Real Humans versus Humans. In Real Humans:

 The androids are known as Hubots rather than Synths.

 More information is revealed to the audience up front; for example, the exact nature of the relationship between ""Anita"" and Leo remains undefined for most of the season in Humans. If you like mystery, watch Humans prior to watching Real Humans.

 The tone is both darker and (paradoxically) more humorous. Not only a bloody season premier, but a greater sense of urgency and more of an ""us against them"" mentality. An example of the humor is when David Eischer's android children walk into an abandoned church for refuge and one of them, aghast upon seeing Jesus on the crucifix (for the first time), exclaims ""Disgusting!""

 Niska is the undisputed leader of free androids (when Leo isn't around). While Niska in Humans has a fierce streak that we occasionally see, Niska in Real Humans is a robot you really do not want to mess with.

 The philosophical points are more readily expressed, such as Inger (Laura in Humans) expressing herself to and about Anita; additionally, Hubots replacing humans (in companionship, in the workforce) is more front and center.

So which is better, Real Humans or Humans? That is almost impossible to answer, because depending on which one you watch first, the other will probably seem flawed (The same dilemma as happened with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B00K6DMT0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B004JMNEE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>). The British production is a bit more polished than the Swedish one, yet each has details lacking in the other (i.e., watch both!)",1439164800,11,2366,5.9674556213017755
