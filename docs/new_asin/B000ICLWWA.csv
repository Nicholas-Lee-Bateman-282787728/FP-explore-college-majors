8145223,5,B000ICLWWA,"Who knew that modern Kashrut was such a farce?  THANK YOU, Jonathan, for opening so many peoples' eyes.  (And WHY have so many people been so quiet until now about the horrific violations of what Jews have been instructed to hold so sacred?)",1170892800,,241,4.5813953488372094
8145224,5,B000ICLWWA,"This is such an eye-opening video, it really proves that animals are hideously abused in slaughterhouses--even kosher ones. I could not in good conscience support such cruelty to animals. That's why I eat a totally vegetarian diet. That way I know for sure that animals did not suffer and die on my behalf. Thanks to Mr. Foer for shedding light on the treatment of animals in kosher slaughterhouses.",1162166400,3,399,4.882352941176471
8145225,5,B000ICLWWA,This is by far the best video I've ever seen about the kosher meat industry! Jonathan Safran Foer's brilliant analysis about the scandal at the AgriProcessors kosher mega-slaughterhouse is a must see for anybody like me who cares about keeping kosher. Some of the undercover scenes were quite graphic but the most shocking things in my opinion were how the corrupt owners of the plant and the kosher certification reps tried to defend such flagrant abuse. Highly recommended!,1161820800,2,475,5.102564102564102
8145226,5,B000ICLWWA,"Foer is so entertaining, while at the same time really making you think. It is great to see him talking about this issue that is so central to Judaism but doesn't seem to get much attention among Jews. I thought kosher meat was more humane, but to see that animals are beaten, starved, mutilated, and intensively confined while kosher authorities pay no heed, and even defend slaughterers who tear internal organs out of still conscious animals, makes me realize how wrong I was. This is a wake-up call. I highly recommend it.",1161820800,3,526,4.728260869565218
8145227,5,B000ICLWWA,"I am such a big fan of Jonathan Safran Foer, so it's not much of a surprise to find this amazing video by him. [...]

The DVD has a full length version and a bunch of extras, including b-roll interview footage of Mr. Foer, and a whole lot more.

A totally great value!",1158105600,,268,4.037735849056604
