Tons of music and tons of dancing!  really interesting way to see breakdancing perfomed in collaboration with electric improv music... you can see the ideas bouncing back and forth between the musicians and dancers, this is pretty unique to say the least... i was there at the original show and this DVD is the next best thing:)",1228867200,,362,4.73015873015873
