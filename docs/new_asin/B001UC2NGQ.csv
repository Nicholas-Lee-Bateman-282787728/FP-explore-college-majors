8343264,5,B001UC2NGQ,This is a great documentary. It looks at two very different directing personalities: Cecil B. DeMille and Eric von Stroheim. The types of movies they did were far different and the problems they had matched their personalities. With first-hand interviews and rare footage this is definitely worth watching if you like Hollywood history.,1448150400,,336,5.3584905660377355
8343265,5,B001UC2NGQ,"Only the second documentary-film ever made about Erich von Stroheim, the 1980 ""Hollywood; Silent Film -The Autocrats"" is perhaps the best(Episode 7) of the British 13-part mini-series. Archivist Kevin Brownlow and assistant David Gill unearthed rare,old,forgotten films to tell their story. They did good. The first half of ""TheAutocrats"" looks at Hollywood titan Cecil B. DeMille, the studio-supported director who came to southern California in 1914 to shoot ""The Squaw Man"" and never looked back. DeMille blended sex and religious spectacle with ""The Ten Commandments(1923)"" and ""King of Kings(1927)"". ""The Autocrats"" features rare clips from DeMille's ""Forbidden Fruit(1921)"" and"" Manslaughter(1922)"". One scene shows DeMille barking at extras on the soundstage. It was actually filmed much later for ""Sunset Boulevard(1950)"", an unusual classic with three Hollywood directors(one directing, Wyler, and two more as actors). The second-half of ""The Autocrats"" is Erich von Stroheim, the Austrian who started as an actor for D.W. Griffith. In 1919, Universal's Carl Laemmle allowed von Stroheim to direct ""Blind Husbands"", a racy(for it's time) story of infidelity that made a bundle. Von Stroheim's next movie, ""The Devil's Passkey"" is not even mentioned; perhaps because it is lost. Next came von Stroheim's ""Foolish Wives"", the first million-dollar movie. Von Stroheim directed four more films(including the 1924 ""Greed"") before his final project, ""Queen Kelly(1929)"", which was never released in the United States. Only the first half of ""Queen Kelly"" was  filmed before von Stroheim was fired. Wild spending ended von Stroheim as a director, and his final days were spent as an actor. ""The Autocrats"" shows von Stroheim directing a World-War 1 combat epic on a Hollywood back-lot. These scenes are from the very good 1932 ""The Lost Squadron"", which starred von Stroheim as a demented film director. In one scene, von Stroheim yells at the actors. In front of him is a row of ever-smaller director's megaphones. A funny touch. Von Stroheim only uses the biggest one. No official DVD of ""The Autocrats"" exists, only the VHS tape.",1401321600,,2134,5.447129909365559
