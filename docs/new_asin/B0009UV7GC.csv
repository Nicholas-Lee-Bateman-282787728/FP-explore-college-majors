8066733,4,B0009UV7GC,"The game continues on and things are getting more intense both in and outside the game.  More unwitting players join the crew of un-dead alien hunters and the aliens keep getting bigger and nastier.  Truely this show is incredible in that it never gets dull, with every episode you are hooked to see the next.  A word of warning though for those who feel the nudity is a bit gratuitous...this volume adds a new flavor to the bloody mayhem: sex, really intense sex.  So be warned, this show is not rated M for nothing.  Even so, the show still kicks *** and I have not been disappointed in the series yet.  Who will survive? Who will die? Who will fight? Only Gantz knows.",1135382400,,671,4.414634146341464
8066734,5,B0009UV7GC,"Gantz is definitively one of the best anime series I have ever seen. I never imagined that I would see an anime with so much suspense and intrigue. The characters are well developed, the story is unique, the dialogue is very real, the Gantz is evil, in fact the pilot is very strong and every chapter makes you want to see more and more.",1133827200,,337,4.28125
8066735,5,B0009UV7GC,"I reviewed the first edition of Gantz, and gave it four stars for the slowness in which the story comes out and the violence of the film. Now, with the start of the second season, I'm a true lover of this series. At the start of the second season, you know the characters and what to expect, and you've already seen some of the changes in them that has happened because of their horrible experience delivered to them by Gantz. Now, you get to watch the story unfold with the characters already used to Gantz. The story, while still slow, is more bearable because of the size of the DVD, and the animation gets better and better with the action. Highly recommended if you enjoyed the first season.",1129680000,,696,4.4453125
