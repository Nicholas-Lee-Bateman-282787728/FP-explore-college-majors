956838,1,6305046891,"I don't know where to begin, this film is so ridiculous. How about Gertrube Stein jumping up and down, jeering and cheering at a boxing match between Carradine and Lone, a match to decide an issue of honor, and in the middle of it, Lone starts doing Karate moves to win? How about Wallace Shawn in drag? How about a cut scene where, inexplicably, a group of people in modern clothing stand around the bar, staring directly into the camera, as it stops and sits with them in frame? How about a painter who can mimic Cezanne, Matisse, and Modigliani, but whose own paintings look like bad 1980's music video collages.

The portrayal of Hemingway is offensive, he rants and pontificates morosely, with little life. If Hemingway acted in real life as he did in this film, he wouldn't have had to commit suicide, someone else would have shot him. This film is a travesty, totally self indulgent garbage. Read a book about the period instead, it is doubtful you will find one as bad as this film.",1111881600,9,990,4.561797752808989
956839,3,6305046891,"Although this film is far from perfect it is a wonderful depiction of Paris during the infamous 1920's when all the great American writers and artists resided there.

Nick Hart (Keith Carradine) is a starving American artist who haunts little Parisian cafes with his charcoal pencil and drawing pad in hand as he sketches people he deems interesting. He becomes intrigued with a darkly mysterious woman named Rachel Stone (Linda Fiorentino) and her corruptly powerful husband Bertram Stone (John Lone). As the story unfolds we discover a past exists between Hart and Mrs. Stone and danger follows their lurking interests along Parisian streets. Mr. Stone is supposedly an art dealer/collector who seems to know all of the most important of people while reducing those he cares little for to pulp. A drunken Hemmingway (Kevin J. O'Connor) along with the likes of Alice B. Tolkas (Ali Giron) and her mate Gertrude Stein (Elsa Raven) make fleeting appearances during the film in a half-hearted attempt to maintain the allure of Paris during the 20's. Hart discovers a way to make a living through his involvement with a rich heiress (Geraldine Chaplin) and an influential gallery owner (Genevieve Bujold) but this connection could also be his decline.

If you are someone who carries on a romance with Paris and all that she holds then you will probably find this film very appealing. Director Alan Rudolph manages to capture what life must have been like during the time of Hemmingway, Fitzgerald and Stein as Americans in Paris. One would almost prefer he had made a film directly related to the famous people he randomly refers to in this movie, we all know they were in themselves extraordinarily interesting subjects. But overall this film is worth watching despite the little imperfections and a bit of bad acting here and there. Carradine and Fiorentino display a decent chemistry in order to carry the story to completion. As always though the true hero here is Paris, a city as old as it is timeless.",1100649600,7,2006,4.949554896142433
956840,3,6305046891,"For we English majors, Paris in 1926 is like Woodstock 1969.  The cerebral high jinks of the period are familiar.  The Dada movement, which is a self-parody of European artiness, has a cameo during a surrealistic funeral of the movie's cad.  Hemingway and Gertrude Stein are also parodied.  The literary icons are not treated well. Hemingway is a failure with two Parisian painted ladies and Stein comes off as a bully and a boxing fan, which is ridiculous.

I'm reading the life of Scott Fitzgerald now and I must admit that this fellow met everyone in Paris and New York with his mad wife in tow.  I wish someone would do a film about Scott and Zelda.  This wistfulness to experience the lives of the Celebes of an artistic and sociological watershed is the stuff dreams are made of.

The Moderns is really a forged masterpiece scam movie.  It is handled deftly, but we are not there for the crime and it's amusing consequences.  Art critics are satirized as pompous know it alls, which is always satisfying.  Tom Wolfe has already written books about modern art and architecture, which describes the fraud in art's periphery.  This film handles that well I think.

The problem with a bad movie: bad acting and a bad script, can harm a film, but not enough for aficionados such as myself, to abandon Paris in 1926.",1099267200,4,1316,4.645021645021645
956841,4,6305046891,"Between 15-18 years ago, filmmaker Alan Rudolph, a protege of Robert Altman's, came out with a trio of really excellent films that captured the feeling of the times and places they were set in beautifully. The first was ""Choose Me"", a story about singles in the tail end of the disco era and the effect casual sex has on its characters; ""Trouble In Mind"", to this day, the ONLY film that attempts to capture the bizarre zeitgeist of the early eighties and the late seventies, a time that every person over 30 has lived through cognitively, but no other filmmaker sought to fictionalize....
Then there was ""The Moderns"": A movie so thick with atmosphere, good acting and mood that you'll be hard pressed to find something to compare it with. The story centers around unemployed artist Nick Hart, (Keith Carradine, the star of Rudolph's other two masterpieces,) dealing with the sudden appearance back in his life of Rachel, a woman who blows hot and cold, and who just happens to be his peripatetic wife from an earlier life. The odd thing is, she's ALSO the wife of a shallow, materialistic so and so named Bert Stone, a ""little man"" who made his fortune in prophylactics. These parts are played by Linda Fiorentino and John Lone....Lone being a truly quirky bit of casting.
Despite her long absence from his life and Stone's presence, they rekindle their old relationship under Stone's nose, although he obviously suspects something from the beginning.
Set in Paris in the 20's, Hart and his fellow characters are pictured as having a peripheral connection with Gertrude Stein's inner circle, a circle that includes Ernest Hemingway. This is where the atmosphere comes in, along with excellent music, as Rudolph recreates the period and setting near-perfectly, allowing his actors to reveal the mechanics of bohemian relationships, circa 1925 or so...
In true Altman/Rudolph fashion, the ensemble cast's the thing, as every character seems to get equal screen time. Geraldine Chaplin has a turn here as one of Hart's paramours and sponsors and Genevieve Bujold is a cagy art dealer Hart has business with. Wallace Shawn also has a part as a ""passing scene"" columnist for a Parisian newspaper who contemplates suicide.
Rudolph pays attention to every tiny detail, and has his American characters speaking English in interplay with each other and his French characters speaking French. Bujold speaks a form of ""esperanto"" that includes BOTH languages throughout the film.
Can't afford that ticket to La Belle France? Rent this movie, break out the brie, boules and chablis and enjoy this substantial, quirky movie!",1047945600,51,2613,5.036951501154735
956842,5,6305046891,"This an entertaining, unassuming film, set in Paris of the 1920s.  I have always liked films set around this time because they are fun in terms of their music, the style of dress, and their mood.  This film loosely follows a struggling young artist (is there any other kind?) as he works on his craft in Paris.  Along the way, you have great costumes and great tunes.  I love the theme song played at the beginning of the film as well as that short ""Da-Da"" piece played in the middle.  Linda Fiorentino supplies the flapper beauty and oh boy is she pretty!  There are some historical figures that pop up in this movie, like a young Hemingway casting about in Paris, and they help to add to the flavour of the film.  If you like films such as ""Henry and June"" or Jennifer Jason Leigh's Dorothy Parker film from the 1990s, then you should give this DVD a spin.  You might enjoy it!",1028419200,13,879,4.3496932515337425
956843,4,6305046891,"I would give this movie five stars for myself, but objectively I recomend it at four. The other reviews do a good job of summing up. I just wanted to add that if your a fan of little touches and subtle humour, this is one of the greats. Hemmingway played more as the kind the drunken writer you might actually meet in real life, constantly giving out philosophy and observations in an un-solicited manner, obsessed with fair play (see the boxing match). Two American tourists in the cafe getting their literary facts wrong in the begining of the movie. An oil painting bobbing up and down as the background of a scene in a moving car... Hope I'm not giving away too much, but the little touches are part of why this is such a fun movie. If your into art, literature and the romantism of the twenties, but can still laugh at it and yourself, this is a great film.",1007596800,11,862,4.3602484472049685
956844,5,6305046891,"A good, solid movie.  I was drawn to this film by Alan Rudolph the director and Keith Carradine the lead actor, then when I saw the other members of the cast I knew the film HAD to be good.  It is set in the art and literature world of 1926 Paris, and has overtones of John Huston's ""Moulin Rouge"" in its occasional biographical sketches.  The characters are living in 1926, and the movie does such a good job of transporting the viewer to The Jazz Age Paris, that no one seems stale.  Keith Carradine once again does a great job of being a disillusioned, cynical man with still a heart of human goodness.  Geneiveve Bujold is excellent as a true, supporting friend, and Linda Fiorentino plays her part perfectly as a love who slips into and out of places, and not always when you would like her to. Geraldine Chaplin is terrific in her removed and superior manner in dealing with everyone.
The song ""Speak to me of Love"" sung slowly and softly in French thoughout parts of the film acts as a binding agent to keep bringing the events together to the main theme.  Most of the situations that come up are believable and attention holding, and it is a solidly enjoyable experience seeing them get worked out.
I drank the wine from its bottle.  I watched the movie.  It was good.",1006128000,14,1276,4.446351931330472
956845,4,6305046891,"I was probably drawn to THE MODERNS because of the 1920's Parisian settings.  I make no secret of the fact that, in another life, I must have been a very happy Parisian.  As the song says, I Love Paris.  Over the past  several years I have spent weeks on end wandering about the streets and  cafes of Paris, searching for the vestiges of the Paris of the lost  generation.  Amazingly enough, if you know where to look, a lot of that  Paris is still around.  For what's not still there, THE MODERNS is one of  the better ways of filling in the blanks.
In my opinion, the plot is just  an excuse to create a unique ambience and plop the viewer into the world of  Paris of the 20's and 30's.  We get glimpses of some of the expatriate  Americans who either made the Parisian scene famous, or became famous  because they were part of that era.  From my own investigations, I have  been led to believe that Hemingway was less of a fop and more of a bully  than the Hemingway of THE MODERNS.  As opposed to one of his fights as it  was portrayed here, Parisians are more apt to talk about the fight that he  picked, in the Falstaff Cafe in Montparnasse, with a man whom he outweighed  by 85 pounds and whom he beat severely.
Not to complain, however,  Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas et al, are only here as  backdrops, and they serve that function perfectly.  The plot, for what it's  worth, centers around a technically expert, but financially unsuccessful  artist named Nick Hart, portrayed by Keith Carridine; Nick's ex-wife and  sometimes lover, played by Linda Fiorentino; and a commissioned art  forgery.  A sub-plot or two also floats around. In particular there is one  about the potentially explosive animosity between Hart and his ex-wife's  current husband.  For comic relief there is a perennially depressed  reporter, known simply as Oiseau, played by Wallace Shawn.
Put all of  these characters, plots and sub-plots into the film can, shake vigorously  and out pops THE MODERNS.  Amazingly enough, I really liked this movie, and  I predict that you will too.",961027200,10,2078,4.638121546961326
956846,5,6305046891,"Sorry, the viewer from the Farmers Market, but you miss the point taking that movie at the face value.
That film is a real miracle, but for the different reasons. It's the essence of postmodernism, all the happenings  are brought to the surface by the undercurrents that are visible only to  these in the know.
Alan Rudolf mocks the Paris of Hemingway's ""The  Movable Feast"" and F.Scott Fitzjerald brilliantly, he takes on all the  components of the mythology and all the known characters are the subject of  a loving parody.
I've never thought that anyone can take seriously the  film's Hemingway, the blubbering drunk, who regals us with his  pseudo-meaningful phrases at the well-appointed intervals.
That's the  film for these who flinch from the words ""Parisian charm"" and  ""the life of boheme"", but are very happy to see all that  revisited by the culturally aware, inventive and intelligent director.",957484800,6,907,5.026845637583893
956958,5,6305046891,"This movie is near to the top of my list.  Being a painter and a lover of Paris, I couldn't help myself.  The movie is filled with scenes
in the 1920's - the hay day- of Paris for the famous American artists, writers, and musicians in Paris.  Art is an attraction for fraud and misadventure from those who only see the social boost and wealth represented in art and intellectual circles.  This movie  is a great spoof on everything and everybody, saying art is not to be taken too seriously.  One unexpected surprise is the soundtrack, a combination of actual French cabaret and contemporary mixes that have the allure and mystery of Paris nights.  The soundtrack alone is memorable winner.",1395705600,4,690,4.7
956959,1,6305046891,"I am one of those sappy people who love France, especially Paris, and will stoop to watch some of the worst pictures just because they are set there.  I am ashamed to admit it, but there it is.  However if you are not an addicted Francophile, just do yourself a favor and stay away from this.  I can't believe that the like of Genevieve Bujold, Geraldine Chaplin and Wallace Shawn agreed to appear in this.  They should REALLY be ashamed.  I won't waste any more of my time detailing the many reasons to avoid this film....I've already wasted two hours of my life.",1343606400,,564,4.436893203883495
956960,5,6305046891,"'The Moderns' is a moody , insightful film about love,  redemption, art and music. A fanciful 1920's Paris plays witness to the dramas that unfold. The soundtrack is incredible. Carradine is perfect. Linda Florentino is smooth and sensual (before she got boobs). Wallace Shawn  plays the dorky gossip columnist to a 'T'. John Lone (the bartender in Kill Bill) plays the bad guy ( but in the end kind of sympathetic). The cafe ambience is a steadfast landmark of Paris. Hemingway, Toklas, Stein,
James Joyce, and Sylvia Beach (proprietor of Shakespeare and Company (Paris) all make their appearances.  See this movie. Buy the dvd. Get the music. Dream it.",1295654400,3,654,4.981651376146789
956961,4,6305046891,"I love this movie and my only issue is that the VCR version, subtitled when the characters spoke French - some very amusing asides are lost in the DVD version because the French is not subtitled.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it enough.",1215993600,4,236,4.619047619047619
956962,2,6305046891,"Nick Hart (Keith Carradine) is a pretentious American artist who lives amongst the expatriate community in 1920s Paris. He wastes most of his time boozing and posing in local cafe's and pestering gallery owner Libby Valentin (Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold) to sell his lame paintings. He becomes involved in a plot by wealthy art patroness Nathalie de Ville (Geraldine Chaplin) to forge three paintings, substituting them for the real ones owned by her husband who she is in the process of divorcing. This leads to friction with American rubber magnate Bertram Stone (John Lone), who happens to be married to Hart's ex-wife Rachel (Linda Fiorentino).

I have wanted to see this film for a long time, but what a disappointment. Main problem, is somehow Keith Carradine seems like he thinks he is so edgy and darkly creative, kind of like the character he plays. Smug about his talent, but showing little evidence that it exists. I was very interested in the paintings from that period, and the Paris expatriate community, but what it showed veered in tone from the pedantic to the ridiculous. Hemmingway, Alice B. Toklas, and Gertrude Stein make an appearance, but are utter cartoons. Bertram Stone, Nick Hart's nemesis, is another badly told joke. For no reason that makes any sense whatsoever he has a fixation on Houdini. I wish I could've escaped from seeing this movie. Finally, Wallace Shawn is an obnoxious gossip columnist named Oiseau. At one point, he is even in drag. He is already ugly enough as a man, and as a woman, his ugliness rivals former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. If these are The Moderns, then call me old fashioned.

956964,4,6305046891,"Director Alan Rudolph's ""The Moderns"" is all about Paris in the 1920's and captures the cafe society, the American expatriates, the artists and the pretentiousness and shallowness of the times.
