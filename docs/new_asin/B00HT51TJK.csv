8635655,2,B00HT51TJK,"This DVD -despite the title it is supposedly a history of the German army in Russia 1941 to 1945- has one big point in its favor and a whole lot against.  The video quality is excellent, and includes a fair amount of footage Ive never seen before, and Ive seen a lot of this stuff.  That is the point in favor.
Now to the negative aspects.  Originally (I hope) done in German, the English translation is terrible, at times incoherent.  This is a comment on the overall military picture in May 1945: Only with the taking over of government business through the new Reich President Great Admiral Doenitz were battles in a hopeless situation stopped.  That is word for word.
Its obvious the translator was not a native English speaker, and not even very fluent.  In fact the writing and the translation are so bad in combination that it is difficult to discern what the video is supposed to be about.  Ostensibly a history of the panzer arm during the Russian campaign, it jumps all over the place.  There is an extended section of messenger dogs and carrier pigeons, which, albeit entertaining and not your usual bill of fare, has little to do with the purported topic.  There are numerous errors which might be factual mistakes or possibly errors in translation, as when (in the Bonus section of picture galleries) the ludicrous statement is made that the Soviet T-34 tank was no match for the German Panzer 38 (T).  Now if you know anything about armored warfare in those days you know that if any German tanker was stupid enough take his 38(T) head to head against a T-34, he didn't live to tell about it.  The same error is repeated a bit later.  Another howler is the statement that during the Stalingrad Counter-Offensive the Russians went out of their way to avoid attacking the Germans and instead broke through the lines held by the Romanian and Bulgarian armies.  Not only were Bulgaria armed forces not involved in that campaign, Bulgaria never even declared war on USSR, as Russia and Bulgaria had close historical and cultural ties.  Only in the late summer of 1944 (nearly two years after Stalingrad) did the Soviet Union declare war on and invade Bulgaria.
The fact that the level of historical accuracy is so low is not the main drawback of this production, however.  The real problem is that this version of history is so pro-German that it has to be considered neo-Nazi propaganda.  This is history as Goebbels would have written it.  You know you are in trouble right at the start when the narrator reminds us how noble the German army was by reading of the list of rules found in every German soldiers personal papers.  Basically they say no illegal orders should be carried out, no civilians will be harmed or even treated disrespectfully, prisoners-of-war must be treated honorably, that type of thing.  These rules exist -I have seen many copies- but were routinely disregarded right from the start of the war.  Watching this documentary you would never know that these same German soldiers and SS men cold-bloodedly murdered more than a million Soviet civilians -Jews and non-Jews- during the campaign.
Every effort is made to put Hitlers Germany in a favorable light.  The Germans didn't invade Poland: the war just broke out in 1939.  But the point is then emphasized that France and England declared war on poor Germany.  And Hitler only ordered the invasion of Russia because Stalin was getting ready to stab him in the back and launch a full scale invasion.  It is entirely possible (maybe even probably) that Stalin was planning on attacking his ally someday, but the clear consensus of the majority of modern historians is that it certainly would not have been in 1941.  And the Russians didn't beat the German fair and square, they only won the war due to massive aid from the Americans and British and their own numerical superiority.  Lend-lease certainly helped, and it is possible the campaign might have been a draw if not for the logistical support thus provided (all those Studebaker trucks and Willys jeeps) but certainly the thousands of Russian tanks and millions of dead Russian soldiers had something to do with the outcome.
Much is made about the decidedly rough handling German civilians received when the Red Army invaded the Reich in 1945; fair enough, but there is not a word about the Holocaust or the Einsatzgruppen or the hundreds of thousands of Russian prisoners-of-war deliberately starved to death by the Germans in 1941-1942.  The word Treblinka never appears, nor Sobibor, nor Belzec.  And just in case you somehow missed the point, the documentary concludes by calling Hitlers Wehrmacht the greatest army of all time[never were there] braver, more disciplined soldiers than the German army.  The millions of brave and disciplined soldiers who died destroying this evil army might offer a different opinion.",1476489600,,4863,4.846432889963724
