2057553,3,B00023BN56,"From Savonlinna. It's an outdoor performance and re-inforces my prejudice against them. Minimal scenery. Not even an attempt to play out the last scene. Plus the whole thing is lip sinc and although the soloists manage all right the chorus doesn't even make the attempt. Musically, the orchestra is a little raw. They play the first act and pause but then run acts 2 and 3 together. Grundheber, Behrens and Salminen and very good. On the whole I would hold out for Kupfer or some other indoor production.",1099180800,6,504,4.738636363636363
2057554,1,B00023BN56,"Good to very good singing, nice chorus, reasonable stage (as far as visible).  But the TV-production is a disaster, with all the completely irrelavant shots in dark passages (of the castle?), the rather uninteresting drawings of a ship (why?) and finally the very bad synchronization between audio and video throughout the whole opera.  If you insist to buy this DVD, don't forget to switch off your screen before you start!",1092096000,12,424,5.042857142857143
2057555,4,B00023BN56,"On musical terms alone, this 1989 production from Savonlinna is worth acquiring - it's the first available on DVD.  Grundheber, Salminen and Behrens are in excellent form (Salminen especially), with excellent work as well by the unknown Raimo Sirkia as Erik.  Despite a few gaffs, the orchestra plays quite well for conductor Leif Segerstam, who manages to propel things forward with a great sense of drama and keep a widely dispersed cast together.
Soundstage is actually quite interesting, given that the performance is inside the courtyard of a castle, but stage noise does intrude now and then (how DARE the stage director get by with having Mary continue to spin while Senta sings her aria!).  Picture and videography are less than state-of-the-art.  Why can't we just enjoy what's happening on stage, rather than having all these fades to stock shots of ships, water, faces, etc.  And not to be able to enjoy the curtain calls!  Unforgivable.
Still, on musical terms alone, an enjoyable and moving production of Wagner's early work.",1090108800,35,1038,5.076470588235294
2057556,3,B00023BN56,"I viewed this production last night. Some great singing Salminen, Grundheber and Behrens. Unknown tenors Sirkia and Silvvasti both sang musically and well. Fine young chours. Problems with synchonization of audio and video. Major orchestra problems especially the horns.
I didn't like the intros to scenes repetitive. Quite annoyed that the first note of the overture is clipped. Sound was primitave for DVD. All in all DVD and video production values not thrilling.",1088812800,10,466,5.397260273972603
2057557,5,B00023BN56,"I am thrilled that this version of Der Fliegende Hollander is available on DVD. Many people will differ in opinion regarding the lead characters and their vocal abilities. I loved this production, from the staging and vocal point of view. Hildegard Behrens and Franz Grundheber sing well and immerse themselves in their respective characters.",1086998400,8,342,5.351851851851852
2057558,1,B00023BN56,"This is a major disappointment. Hildgard Behrens is undergoing some troubling period with her voice, which is practically in shreds here. As a result, her performance is a trial both to herself as well as to the listener. Grundheber is a pale Dutchman and his phrasing is often choppy. The production is dark and unfriendly to the DVD viewer, and the direction and orchestral accompaniment is unremarkable.
Better look elsewhere for a DVD of this opera.",1086739200,13,453,4.973684210526316
2057609,5,B00023BN56,"This is a mesmerizing performance.  It pulls out all the dramatic stops.  Hildegard Behrens is a wonderful Senta, and Franz Grundheber is compelling as the Dutchman.",1384905600,,165,5.3076923076923075
2057610,5,B00023BN56,"Of the few renditions of this opera available on DVD, I chose this one because I was familiar with one of the lead singers. I love opera but am not qualified to remark the vocal qualities of singers voices, I just know what I like, and I liked this one. The singing, acting, and orchestral playing moved me to understand the story better, and to appreciate Wagner's music even more.",1376870400,,382,4.4714285714285715
2057611,5,B00023BN56,This is a wonderful production of a Wagner classic. To watch it is almost like being at the festival. The singing is excellent and enjoyable in every sense of the words.,1376524800,,169,4.483870967741935

2057614,5,B00023BN56,"I had a negative attitude going into this performance, based on other reviews here and the suspicion that all non-Met Wagners are more or less Regietheater trash.  Right away, the overture was wonderfully & competently played - exciting, dramatic, as this music should be.  Then it turned out this was not at all one of those 'modernized' sillinesses.  Everything was tasteful and appropriate.  The singing and playing was first-rate - this was intended to be a world-class, knock-out performance and it certainly is - at least the equal of a typical Bayreuth performance, actually better. The castle walls acoustics mauy have favorably reinforced the singing - who cares, it was tremendous.

To those who object to some of the liberties taken photographically - no, Virginia, you're not seeing what the attendees saw - you're  seeing better.  After all, we who are denied traveling to Finland in desperate quest of an acceptable 'Hollaender' have the  right to a few liberties that only a film can provide.  Thing is, it was tasteful and appropriate.

Of course, nothing is perfect, as Voltaire points out.  They should have had dual cameras to record the faces of singers singing duets or trios and separated physically.  Instead, at one point they just showed a still pic of Senta & the Dutchman while both were singing away.  Dumb.  And then, why not record the bows taken after the performance instead of showing credits, as the Met always does?  Really dumb.  BTW I speak more or less fluent German and I was not aware of synch problems.  Did someone mean between the singinmg and the subtitles maybe, which makes no sense anyway?  Besides, you should be following the subtitles (in German if possible), not looking down the throats of the singers all the time.  Unless you're a dentist, amybe ...

Still - with this dvd you get a complete 'Dutchman' - every word, and most importantly it's the revised version instead of the really obsolete original, the way stupid Bayreuth always insists on.  In fact, this performance is so to be preferred over the Harry Kupfer/Estes/Bayreuth one that I'm not going to elaborate.  It would take too long.",1278633600,6,2148,4.908333333333333
2057615,3,B00023BN56,"Undoubtfully a fine looking to this opera, but the audio record got horrible because dynamical compression used. Only for referece, but frustrating to audiophiles. The Dutchman singer is fantastic.",1278201600,,197,5.827586206896552
2057616,2,B00023BN56,"What is the point of buying a DVD if you can't enjoy what you SEE as well as hear?  I liked what I heard well enough, but visually, the production is stupid.  The costuming is simply awful!  Senta, for example, wears a silk and velvet dress (for spinning?!?)  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the constant scenes of a pen and ink drawing of the Dutchman's ship superimposed over waves every time nobody is singing are more than annoying.  The scenes of the (Finland's Olavinlinna)castle grounds at other points during the opera obviously have nothing to do with the story.  The camera work is especially awful.  Extreme close-ups of chorus members are pointless and the close-ups of main cast members are a mistake because of the heavy make-up they wear. Why the director decided to give the Steersman a fancy blanket for his nap is a mystery.  Moreover, the Steersman's pawing over the treasure is a new story not invented by Wagner. If you want to film an opera in an outdoor setting, this is an example of how NOT to do it.  We see the Dutchman's crew - they wear spandex outfits with nets over their faces - apparently the newest thing in attire for the dead.  But, we see them entirely only when the carry the treasure chest for Daland to inspect.  The rest of the time, we see only their arms waving through holes in their ship. What a strange thing for ghosts to do!  The only thing worse that could happen to Wagner than Finland is Kupfer.",1118707200,22,1454,4.50763358778626
2057617,4,B00023BN56,"I first purchased this DVD for two reasons.  First, I was about to be in a production of Der Fliegende Hollander (in the chorus) and I wanted to get a feel for the story.  Second, I wanted to hear Matti Salminen, the Finish Bass whose deep, sonorous voice is so compelling.  Overall, I was not disappointed.  This is a good production of one of Wagner's more accessible operas.  The staging is different. Filmed inside of a Finish castle, it looks a bit odd at times.  I would have preferred a more traditional stage, but I found myself getting used to it as the production went on.

Salminen is first rate as the captain and father, Daland.  The hard walls of the castle really show off his resonance and power, and his acting is good (which is not always the case with many big name opera stars).  Daland is really more of a supporting character in the opera, and Salminen handles it well without overshadowing the two main roles, Senta and the Dutchman.

Bass-Baritone, Franz Grundheber does a great job in the role of the tortured Dutchman.  He has a power and presence that lends itself to the dark music and drama that this role demands.  This is a role that can overwhelm lesser voices and actors, but Grundherber makes a believable, even sympathetic Dutchman.  This is, to me, the true core of the character.  He is more multi-leveled than many portray him.  He is not a one-dimensional ""baddy"" but a sorrowful soul desperately seeking redemption.

I have other recordings with Hildegard Behrens and I must say, I have heard her better.  But even with that, she is not bad and does a passable job as Senta.  She is by no means a huge disappointment or a distraction, but I would say she is the weaker link in this phenomenal cast.

The chorus is also solid.  The fishermen are hearty and lively and sing their chantey section quite well, and the women do an exceptional job with the ""spinning chorus"".  I found the staging for the ""ghosts"" a bit odd, however.  They are never actually seen, only as arms the wave from the hull of their ship.  That is part of the production quality that I did find distracting. Since this was originally a television production, some of the quality and the choice of camera shots were questionable, if not down right dumb.  There is lots of cutting away to graphic representations of the Dutchman's ship, which I thought looked corny.

Overall, I would recommend this DVD.  It is, as I said, a great introduction to Wagner.  It is a smaller opera by Wagnerian standards, the story is pretty straightforward (especially for Wagner) and the music is first rate.  While not perfect, it is definitely worth it.",1114646400,7,2647,4.622317596566524
2057618,5,B00023BN56,"The best sung ""Flying Dutchman"" available in any format. Every  CD set has a serious flaw with at least one singer in the cast and that usually  being a squally Senta. The Dorati set on London has a wonderful cast but nothing comes to life. On Myto the same Senta and Dutchman are superb but the sound is poor. Some Reviewers have criticized this Savonlinna  production and some rather scathingly but we are in debt to Kultur for making this production available. Behrens, Salminen and Grundheber produce beautiful sound, unstrained power and great interpretation.  The Naxos recording is quite good maybe a little overrated but well sung. Gramophone refers to a Sawallisch recording on EMI but I haven't heard or seen that recording. I don't expect to

hear a better sung ""Dutchman"", certainly in the near future. This belongs in

your collection for its beautiful, exciting  and equally inspired singing as well as for the superb playing of the orchestra conducted by the inspired Leif Segerstam. When Behrens was in good voice, she was, as here, thrilling.",1111708800,12,1059,4.9491525423728815
8021150,2,B00023BN56,"Th CD had several ""breaks"" in it in the 2nd act where everything went black for a short while. I did not think the performance all that good even though singing was very good, the sets, lighting and acting were not very good.  But I can't blame the CD seller for a not very good performance or a faulty CD.  The transaction itself deserves a bravo.",1509148800,,348,4.257575757575758
8021151,4,B00023BN56,"It is a matter of taste whether you will like this production, and plenty of pros and cons have already been posted here by others.  One thing I can contribute is the answer to a question I had when debating whether to order this disk or not:  Subtitles.  Yes it has them in English, German, Spanish and French.  Amazon did not indicate this where it usually does, at least at the time of this purchase.",1475193600,2,403,4.333333333333333
8021152,5,B00023BN56,"Even though this piece of music is a failure of Wagner by some critics. I have always loved The Flying Dutchman. Hildegard Behrens is fit for this particular piece of music as well as the other members of the opera cast. The orchestra is great and by being close by the old castle is what adds effect to this piece of music.

8021156,4,B00023BN56,"This is very decent production of a superb opera. The singing is very good. Behrens is great in the role of Senta and delivers near sacred music in her arias. It's beautiful. Salminen and Grundheber are superb and the lesser parts are excellently presented.

The grand party chorus is terrific. Makes you want to jump up and join them---grab a mug and do it!

I did find the slow camera tour of the castle during the overture to be annoying. I'd rather just watch the orchestra. There are too many cutaways to the water image. The annoyances are minor.

The ending is what cost this DVD a star. The old Dutchman is boarding his ship, Senta is torn, Erik flashes his gun and we fade to a fake water image as Senta walks toward it. It's poorly conceived and misses the impact of her choice.

Still, it's Wagner and done well. I would not pay top dollar for this DVD but it's a bargain at current prices. Buy it while you can still get it.",1415577600,,936,4.331428571428572
8021157,3,B00023BN56,"This performance of Wagner's THE FLYING DUTCHMAN from Savonlinna, featuring Franz Grundheber, Hildegard Behrens, and Matti Salminen, is not nearly as interesting or impressive as the Bayreuth video featuring Simon Estes, Lisbeth Balslev, and Matti Salminen.  In this performance (Savonlinna), Franz Grundheber's voice is too soft for the title role, and he overacts severely, with exaggerated gestures and comical facial expressions.  The Dutchman, while tormented inside, ought to be cool, arrogant and aloof when he interacts with Daland.

As another reviewer pointed out, Hildegard Behrens has some bad vocal problems during this performance.

In his other videotaped performance (the Bayreuth video I mentioned above), Matti Salminen played Daland as a nasty character, greedy and bullying.  Here he plays him the other way, as a gentle sweetie-pie who only wants the best for his daughter.  It's nice to be able to compare him playing the role in both modes, but the nice-guy performance here is much less interesting than his rough-edged rendition at Bayreuth.  Playing hostile, menacing, dominating characters like Hagen or the Grand Inquisitor is Salminen's special gift when it comes to acting.

The chorus is also less interesting here than in the other video.",1414281600,,1270,5.476923076923077
