4684457,4,B005FQ2GWY,"ok, it's steve winwood, so we pretty much know what to expect.  And he does not disappoint.  Kind of a different approach to his classics, in a jazzy way.  Quite good, and enjoyable, but as usual, it leaves you wanting so much more.  Sure would like to see Steve really rock some, and less of this latter day steely dan renditions.",1327968000,2,331,4.377049180327869
4684458,3,B005FQ2GWY,"The filming and sound are great, but the the extras should have been included in the main show. Just seemed to be a very short DVD.",1324252800,2,131,4.076923076923077
4684459,5,B005FQ2GWY,"Interesting how they have decided to release this DVD under a different name.  Truth is this is the soundstage recording Steve Winwood performed in 2003.

I still wish they would just release the entire show.

Here is my review I posted for the original release....

What a stellar performance! It's ridiculous and a shame the entire performance was not released for this DVD. I'm happy they included 3 bonus tracks, but that's only 11 of the 19 songs performed that night. I attended the taping for this show, and it was like all previous reviewers have said, an incredible performance and it needs to be released in its entirety.

The original set list for the more than 2  hour show was...
1. Pearly Queen
2. Different Light
3. Cigano (For The Gypsies)
4. Can't Find My Way Home
5. Walking On
6. 40,000 Headmen
7. Empty Pages
8. Final Hour
9. Silvia
10. Rainmaker
11. Bully
12. Glad/Freedom Rider
13. Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring
14. Higher Love
15. Back In The High Life Again
16. Dear Mr. Fantasy
17. The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys
18. Why Can't We Live Together?
19. Gimme' Some Lovin'

Except for taking a few of quick breaks to allow the cameramen to swap recording tapes, there should be little editing that needs to take place. Do us all a favor and release the entire show!",1322870400,27,1292,4.495726495726496

8470485,4,B005FQ2GWY,Steve Winwood is one of my favorite artists. I still have all of his solo vinyl albums. I bought both the DVD & the Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray is much better and clearer in sound & picture.,1426982400,,183,4.111111111111111
