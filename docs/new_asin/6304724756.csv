Strong hiss can be heard in scenes (noise floor too high), but never a distraction.
The Dialog is Mandarin - (the case says ""CANTONESE"") - many of the actors speak mandarin, some speak cantonese (The dialog is dubbed from Cantonese (so both the Mandarin and English track are dubs) /
Neither track has Jackie Chan's voice.

I don't know where you could get a finer version for your collection! Surely, no artist has all blockbuster projects, heavens look at the stuff Jackie is part of now - very different the his smash hits, and not blockbusters, but nevertheless, CHAN!

go for it collectors - you'll be glad you did",1358121600,,1321,4.7631578947368425
7877269,3,6304724756,"This movie is definitely worth getting if you're a huge Jackie fan. It's got a nice plot compared to some other lesser-known titles from his early years, and he is actually in this movie quite a bit- this is not a cameo role.",1230422400,,225,4.255813953488372
7877270,3,6304724756,"Chu Feng is on a mission to kill Jackie's family. She butchers everyone exept for Jackie, she falls in love with him and later saves his life by putting Jackie through a torturous trainning regimen so that Jackie can defend himself against some two-faced ""friends"". This film is chillingly violent!!!",1037059200,5,300,5.02
7877271,3,6304724756,"To Kill With Intrigue is a great little kung-fu movie; if you like the genre, you'll dig it. Mind you, this disc is so mind-numbingly awful that it's hard to watch. The video transfer is grainy and spotted, the audio fades in and out and pops, and just to add insult to injury, while the film has both english and cantonese audio, there are no subtitles; nor is there even a menu option to change the audio- it must be done manually.
Certainly worth the purchase if you can find it for [$$$] ...- good as the film itself is, this is low-quality enough that you shouldn't be expected to pay any more.",1036886400,,599,4.3097345132743365
7877272,2,6304724756,"Don't expect a lot from this film.  Although it is better than some of Jackie's earlier films under his contract with Lo Wei (New Fist of Fury, The Killer Meteors, Dragon Fist, and many others), it's not that great.  The acting is pretty dull throughout most of the movie.  The entire film is so full of plot wholes and boring scenes, that you rarely care about what's happening.  Most of the action is better than some of Jackie's other movies from the early 70s, but they still need lots of work.  Although some of them are interesting, the action is way too slow to fully entertain any Jackie Chan fan.  This film should only be seen if you want to complete your Jackie Chan collection.",996969600,2,689,4.472
7877273,3,6304724756,"This low-budget 1977 Kung Fu flick has heartbroken Chan obsessing over his girlfriend Chin-Chin, who has been ""stolen"" by one of his good friends (who just turns out to be THE bad guy).  The plot is excessively  complicated and not easily understood, but, in a way, the film is touching.  It's part love story, part Kung Fu slapstick.  The fight scenes are  reasonable, with young Chan displaying great gymnastics feats; but the  stunts don't nearly rank up with the best of Jackie.  I was slightly moved  by Jackie's performance, but, to be perfectly honest, it was mediocre at  best.  The low budget is quite evident, with cheap props (like a rubber  hand), and ""dress for less"" costumes.  But, hey, if you're a  Chan-atic like myself, buy it.  Someday, it might be a collector's item.",917136000,6,787,4.776119402985074
