326465,4,6301374126,"I thought it would be a corny old movie and in many ways it was, but my wife had been going on about how much effect it had on her when she saw it when it was still a new movie so I told her I'd see if I could find it on DVD. It's not the greatest acting, but it was inspirational. I'm a Christian, so of course I like the theme of somebody who saw God's grace even when faced with adversity, but even if you aren't a Christian I think you might like it just because it's an amazingly inspiring story of how a young girl, who would have every excuse in the world to give up, really began living when she thought that her life was over.",1431043200,2,635,3.854961832061069

326480,5,6301374126,"I read Joni's story when I was a teenager, so I was happy to find this movie about her life.  Look for her other books also!  She's written many inspirational books.  We cannot fathom what it is like to be her, but she gives us a glimpse and soldiers on inspiring us to be thankful...and useful!",1384819200,4,295,4.232142857142857

326482,5,6301374126,"This true story about this brave woman is captured for us as she  plays the part of herself on screen. It covers basically from just before her injury to about 10 years after. I especially like how she went through all the range of emotions and how she finally made peace with God as the injury played itself out. I am so prone to depression so this movie as well as reading her bio helped me out alot.

This movie was done in 1979 I think so don,t expect high def when you watch this. She is still around,paints,sings(I have some songs by her)and has undergone cancer treatments recently --what a woman of God.

She also has a book coming out next year that speaks to the subject of her husband Ken of 30+ years and his feelings as he met,married and took care of her. I need to know more about her fantastic loyal husband,how he can love her like he does and apply it to my marriage. Great movie,no swearing,cussing or nudity--a church quality movie all the way.",1351468800,3,964,4.344444444444444
326483,5,6301374126,I read the book about Joni's life when I was a teenager........probably about the time this movie came out.  The book and movie are both inspiring!,1345852800,,147,4.653846153846154
326484,4,6301374126,"The DVD ""Joni"" is worth seeing.  The wonderful story of faith, hope and courage in the face of a life-altering accident, which left a young woman paralyzed from the neck down.  Never giving up, learning how to paint with her mouth, Joni became a renowned painter, speaker, author of several books, a wonderful vocalist, and an inspiration for all who see and hear her story.",1345420800,,374,4.7384615384615385
326485,5,6301374126,"The movie shows how Joni was able to come back
from braking her neck, and work for the Lord.
Everyone who gets DVD, should show in their churchs",1339718400,,144,4.178571428571429
326486,5,6301374126,"Joni shines in this. She is not the best actress in the world but who said she had to be the best at EVERYTHING! She can do almost everything well and to sing and paint and teach and write and well.....what else did we thing she had to do? She is lovely in this film. Beauty that surpasses all. I loved it, all of it and am taking it to my local library for them to share with anyone who wants to know her better. I just hope it gets a lot of attention there. I would love to keep it but there are too many who need to see this to let it sit on my shelf and collect dust. I have read her Memoirs, Choices Changes and the ""Joni"" book. I have some devotionals too with her artwork. I think one of the most amazing aspects about her movie was the art show set up by her wonderful Dad and Diane, her best friend. I wish I had had a best friend like Diane who came to her and made her healing more possible and shorter. I credit GOD through Jesus Christ for who this amazing woman has become. She is 62 now being born in 1949. She is also now a cancer survivor and that blows me away! What else should this woman have to go through to please her God? It must have been all the drugs pumped into her for 45 years in that chair. Anyway, she can now be a light to cancer victims. How cool is that....Huh?

Get this movie and put it in your library. Watch it twice or three times and let it go. It will do it's heart-work again and again even though it is 30 years old. Just watch it for your own heart too. You will be blessed!",1311379200,12,1519,3.9

326488,5,6301374126,We just love Joni's God given faith and her solid foundation.  This movie would be helpful to anyone enduring a very difficult trial.  You will see how Joni continues to persevere through life with her faith in God.,1284336000,,215,4.631578947368421
326489,5,6301374126,"I bought this DVD to encourage a family member who is disabled.  I saw the movie back in the 1970s.  When I saw that it was now available in DVD form, I had it sent as a gift to another state.  They received the DVD in good time and condition.  I love Amazon for my being able to find all of my favorite old movies",1274486400,,314,3.7846153846153845
326490,3,6301374126,"It almost goes without saying that this is a nice and inspiring story. I say that because most people who view this know who Joni Eareckson (Tada) is before they watch this 1980 story of her amazing life. Christians, I assume, are the ones who know about this woman and how she turned a tragedy into a very powerful witness to God.

Joni plays herself in this movie while the rest of the cast are professional actors. She's a so-so actress but her story is so extraordinary I didn't find myself getting concerned about her acting. The only problem I had with the film was that was a tad too slow. Watching almost two hours of a woman in physical rehabilitation is not easy!

Yes, she is an incredible woman - and continues to be today - but there are a number of frustrating and depressing moments in the film as we see her grapple, mentally, physically and spiritually with trying to cope with being almost totally paralyzed. I just cannot fathom what she, and others like her, has gone through. You get some sense of that in this film.

I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who has suffered a major physical setback in their life. You would be hard-pressed to find someone who has overcome them as well as Joni, so this movie could be a great encourager for you. I am glad this is finally out on DVD!).

Also - for anyone - I would recommend reading some of Joni's books, check out her artwork and just - if nothing else - learn a little about what makes this woman tick. It might just turn your life around, too.",1226620800,28,1525,4.3780918727915195

THERE IS LIFE AFTER DISABILITY INSTEAD OF DISABILITY JONI TURNED IT TO OTHER ABILITY SHE STARTED DOING OTHER THINGS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN THOUGHT OF.

7811213,5,6301374126,"Clearly this is a dated DVD, but the content is very honest in the struggle of living life with such a challenge.  I wanted our grandchildren to watch this solely to realize the risks of diving in an unsafe location.",1483574400,2,216,4.4
7811214,4,6301374126,"I love Joni and her ministry. The movie is dated, of course, but in my opinion this movie focused more  on her relationships with men and how the relationships were affected by her accident. I can't let my grandkids watch this because it has way too much kissing and making out in it. I was disappointed by that as they are very interested in Joni and her relationship with God and her ministry. It would be wonderful if someday this movie could be remade without so much emphasis on the male relationships and be more blatant about how God has gotten her thru all of her life circumstqnces. Love and appreciate Joni !!!",1469664000,2,620,4.486725663716814

""Joni,"" the movie offers a front row seat to a portrayal of the extreme journey Joni Erickson embarked on as a teenager  following a diving accident that resulted in her becoming a quadriplegic  It's a 70's movie and is likely low budget as well -- so, don't watch it for the cinematography -- but the message is unpatronizingly encouraging and timeless.  It is one of the best movies to watch if you're feeling overwhelmed by the circumstances of your life.",1442275200,4,484,4.658823529411765
