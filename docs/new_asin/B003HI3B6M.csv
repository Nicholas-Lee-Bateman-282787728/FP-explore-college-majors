4125762,5,B003HI3B6M,"These two Leap Frog DVDs are excellent educational material for my 5 year old grandson.  He watches them over and over and displays immediate improvement in spelling and reading after watching them.  His grasp of numbers, quantities and his approach to numerical problems improved dramatically after watching the Math Adventures to the Moon.",1290556800,,341,5.415094339622642
4125763,5,B003HI3B6M,"My 3 year old loves the letter factory.  Since watching it just a handful of times over the past couple of months he already can tell us almost all of the letter sounds.  He loves to walk around singing the song, and does so almost daily.
The math video has also been helpful for our 6 year old who has been working to master skip counting.  A great buy, and highly recommended.  We plan to give this set to my sisters kids for Christmas!",1289692800,,438,4.178571428571429
4125764,5,B003HI3B6M,"I was not sure if I wanted to get the Math adventure DVD at first.  I had used the Math circus DVD with another one of my children and it was o.k for him, but not one of his favorites.  But, after reading some reviews on this set, I purchased this two DVD set that included the Letter Factory (which we love but had a very scratched version of it).  Wow!  I'm glad I got this set.  My 3 year old son LOVES Math Adventures to the Moon.  Now, he goes around the house sorting and counting things...  I'm surprised how this excited him.  He has known his letters and basic numbers (1-20 skip a few) for quite a while, but rarely felt the need to use his number skills.  Now, he makes all kinds of excuses to count, to sort, to count backwards, to make patterns, to find shapes,... What a great buy this turned out to be for us!",1284163200,14,824,4.068322981366459

4125769,1,B003HI3B6M,This is neither a double disc set nor a double feature. This dvd only consists of the Math Adventure to the Moon. I bought it specifically for the Letter factory. The math was supposed to be an added bonus. Very disappointed.,1515628800,,225,4.512195121951219
4125770,5,B003HI3B6M,"I have three children who all watched the Lettet Factory at age two, and greatly benefited from it.  This video is very well made.  It keeps the kids very interested, to the point that they would rather watch this than other children's shows on TV or YouTube.  And it is incredibly educational at the same time, they are absorbing a lot of information about the alphabet and the sounds of different letters at the same time.  It gives them a great head start on reading.  This is the best made educational video for toddlers I've ever used, I highly recommend it",1514678400,,562,4.524752475247524

4125773,4,B003HI3B6M,"The letter factory is amazing. I bought this for my 3 year old son, but even my almost 2 year old daughter is picking up on the letter sounds. They are both uninterested in the Math portion, and I understand why.",1510963200,,212,4.195121951219512
4125774,3,B003HI3B6M,My son enjoyed the Letter one but lost interest after a few times. He wouldn't even sit through the number one.,1510876800,,111,4.333333333333333
4125775,5,B003HI3B6M,"My two toddlers love these videos. I use them for pre-k homeschool. My first grader even loves them, although he already knows all of the content. I feel they're a good refresher for him. The math goes over counting by 1s, 2s, 5s, and 10s, which is really good info. They cover patterns, shapes, sizes, colors, addition, and all sorts of math concepts. It's very fun, too. My kids don't realize they're learning! The Letter Factory covers all of the letters, what they look like, what they're called, what they say, and so much more. This movie is very fun, too. I can watch both of these movies, and at 30 years old, I will still chuckle at some of the jokes. I'm also amazed by how they explain some of the concepts. I recommend these movies to people ALL the time. Whether you're trying to get a leg-up before kindergarten or you're homeschooling your kids or just like for them to watch things that are educational, I highly recommend buying this set. Also, I received BOTH movies. No issues here.",1510272000,,1001,4.535911602209945

4125781,5,B003HI3B6M,"When my two-year-old became interested in learning his letters, I turned to my trusty Letter Factory DVD only to find out we'd worn it out! So, when I found this two pack, (really one disk that is two-sided,) I was very excited! My oldest two, now almost six, watched this DVD at age 2, and had their letter sounds nearly learned after only one view!
Our now three-year-old requests to watch Letter Factory in his bed every afternoon during ""rest time"" and it didn't take him long before he could recognize the letters of the alphabet and sing me their sounds.
The kids aren't as excited about the Math Adventures on the Moon, but it is still educational, and gives a fun look into numbers.",1501459200,,690,4.528
4125782,3,B003HI3B6M,"So I got this DVD for my son,it says it was a double feature for which I paid 12$ but the o my thing on that DVD was the math adventure. It was falsely advertised bc it said a double feature. There was no letter factory on the dvd",1498089600,,230,3.7142857142857144

4125784,5,B003HI3B6M,"I've spent a year trying to get my 4 year old to learn letters. It's been excruciating. She turns 5 just before the school year and starts kindergarten this year, so I was getting desperate. I was recommended this product by at LEAST 12 different people, and personally seen the results of it on 2 friends' children. After having this movie for 1 week she went from only knowing the first letter of her name, to knowing every letter and the sound it makes by heart. Unlike other educational shows and games I've tried to interest her in, this one she actually watches and enjoys on loop all day every day.
My 2 year old has also befitted. She is already picking up on some of the letters and sounds!!!
The math movie isn't AS amazing as the letter factory, but it is still very educational, and has been helpful to have to break up the frequency of the letter factory, helping them to not tire of it too quickly.
It has been worth every cent and more, and has become my ""gift to give"" at my daughter's birthday parties that she attends. Every home with small children needs to own this video yesterday.",1495670400,,1102,4.4068627450980395
4125785,1,B003HI3B6M,package is very misleading.  I thought I was getting both the Math Adventure to the Moon and the Letter Factory.  I got Math Adventure but the Letter Factory was just a weird version of the song.  No video.  Very disappointed,1488153600,4,225,4.55

4125810,5,B003HI3B6M,"After six years, these movies continue to be awesome. I am a Pre-k teacher and when the weather is icky, these are good ""go-to"" videos. The Letter Factory gives the pure letter sound without the added ""uh"" sound that is so commonly added to many consonant sounds. The movie is bright and colorful, and the letter songs are catchy, so students catch on quickly and sing along. The Math Adventure is just as fun for my sweeties. I would definitely recommend them to teachers and parents-- of course, with the added warning to use sparingly. Too much of a good thing isn't always good.",1483747200,,582,4.605769230769231
4125811,4,B003HI3B6M,"My daughter loves this DVD! The songs are catchy & she has caught on quickly to phonics & letter sounds thanks to the songs. Parts of it are pretty cheesy, but my daughter is 4, so she loves it.",1479340800,,194,4.0
4125812,1,B003HI3B6M,This was not the product we received. It was not a double feature. It included the Math video but not the Alphabet video. The DVD had no printing on it which I thought was strange.,1479168000,,180,4.171428571428572

4125814,5,B003HI3B6M,"My son loves this video, which thrills me because it's a great educational option. He likes the math video a little better than the alphabet one but both are cute and age appropriate. The videos are a great length for preschoolers to keep their attention and engage their learning. The video is also a great price. No qualms about this purchase :)",1473811200,,347,4.612903225806452
4125815,5,B003HI3B6M,"The Letter Factory DVD taught my 4 yr old AND 2 yr old all their uppercase letters and the basic sound each letter makes in a matter of weeks. Now, almost 7 months later they both point out letters to me on various items around the house and the town and tell me their sounds too.

The Math Adventure to the Moon helped my 2 yr old learn to count (she can get to 15 now on her own). My 4 yr old now understands what counting by tens means because of this DVD. He can count to 49 all on his own, and to 100 if he's looking at a number chart! Plus he loves outer space, so it totally holds his attention.",1471219200,,602,3.8548387096774195

My four year old now knows her ABC's and the sounds they make. in just two week she learned all this! we catch our self singing the songs all the time! its been a month since I  purchase and i will forever be thankful to this great company. My daughters preschool teacher said that she will probably be able to start reading  in a couple of months  since she has mastered all the sounds. I bought the teacher a copy for her class!

I truly credit Letter Factory for helping my two year old learn all of her letters and their sounds WAY before it was expected in pre-school. She's now 4, starting to read, and still loves to watch Letter Factory with her two year old brother. Hopefully he is soaking all the info in, and she just likes that it's entertaining.

I had gotten him the Word Factory some time ago, so the letter factory was kind of not as useful. Also, some of the pronunciation seemed somewhat off, for example, the 'L' sound which is rendered as 'el' instead of 'le'.",1356652800,,337,4.1692307692307695

My main reason for buying this video was for the letter factory. My son loves the space adventure but he is not interested in the letter factory. I found the letter factory boring, but I had hoped this video would help him with recognizing letters and sounds as well as get him interested in the alphabet.

Letter Factory is adorable and the alphabet song is really catchy and a great way to teach young children phonics. It's such a great introduction to the alphabet and learning to read. I love that Math Adventure to the Moon doesn't just stick to counting but incorporates many different aspects of math into the video. The animation is done pretty well too and the videos don't last so long that kids start to lose attention with it.",1294012800,,567,4.514563106796117

My boys also love these DVDs(especially letter factory).  They are 5 and 2 1/2.  At the age of 3 my older son did not like to do any of the other typical things kids do to learn letters (like flashcards, ABC books, etc.).  He was not a good talker at the time.  But, he is a visual learner and loves videos.  He learned all of his letters from watching Letter Factory.  My other son is not a visual learner and doesnt watch much television.  He started talking well very early.  He likes to read books and touch/color projects however he also stops playing to watch these DVDs from time to time.
