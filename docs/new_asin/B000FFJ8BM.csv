How sad that people responsible for this otherwise great show sold out to the tobacco weasels and their deadly drug. All the smoking should have been digitally removed.

And That is the Pretender. Well, sort of, the 2 movies that are going to be released after NBC canceled the Pretender will be out soon but at least they did something similar to what they did with MacGyver.

2562730,1,B000FFJ8BM,"I usually love TV series, but this series was terrible. I got Season 1 for really cheap on Black Friday and was immediately hooked... When Season 2 was just as amazing, I thought I'd found my new favorite series! Season 3 started to jump the shark a bit, but they pulled it off okay in the end. Then the writers clearly couldn't come up with ideas anymore and took season 4 to absolutely ludicrous places. The worst part is the ending of the series - it seems to me that the writers knew the show was cancelled, so they set themselves up for movie deals later on at the expense of their audience. This was such a cheap move - it's really a shame that they destroyed the series to make themselves a few extra bucks. If you're going to watch the series, I'd say watch seasons 1 and 2 with some friends then get together and make up your own ending since the writers refused to do their jobs. (Also, I tried buying the follow-up movie just to see if they actually came up with a decent ending, but it's not in stock anywhere I've looked.)",1486166400,2,1035,4.258883248730965

2562738,3,B000FFJ8BM,"I absolutely loved The Pretender series when it played on TV and for years have wondered about the ending. I never got to see the final episode and have searched for quite some time when I came across this DVD.
The quality of the DVD was one of the reasons I give only the 3 stars here. A few times the voices were not lined up correctly with the person and the picture got stuck. This was quite annoying especially when it happened at a crucial time in the episode. This did not make me very happy. Each time I was able to fix this by rewinding and replaying. One time I had to go to take it out and put it back in again. The DVD machine was practically new and hardly used so it was not the machine.
The other reason I give it the 3 stars is I didn't get the ending of the series???
I specifically remember where the story was way back when and what it's showing here was not it??? So where is my ending???
I guess I have to go back and look more...maybe Season 4 is not the final season and you shouldn't be advertising it as such...very disappointed to say the least in the quality of the DVD and of what you call the final season...which in reality only shows the real conspiracy the last few episode's, and should have been much longer then that?

2562749,5,B000FFJ8BM,"I give the series 5 stars but the DVD production only 2 stars.  These DVD's are very annoying.
1.  There is no Play ALL selection
2.  Not only do you have to select each episode from the main menu, but after you do ANOTHER menu appears and you have to select Play Episode.  I wouldn't have selected the episode from the main menu if I didn't want to play it.  I see why they have done this.  Instead of letting you select Language from the main menu and then have it apply to all selections, they have the Language selection on each episode's submenu.  Like I'm going to watch episode #1 in English and #2 in German????
3.  These are two-sided DVD's but there isn't any writing around the center hole on the flip side to alert you to this fact.  The printing on the A side has tiny type (maybe size 2 font) saying ""Episodes 1-4 on side A, Episodes 5-7 on B"" but trust me, you really have to look for it with a magnifying glass.  I didn't realize this and missed half the episodes the first time I played them!

I would have preferred to pay a couple dollars more and have decent DVD's rather than these crappy things.  They are so annoying that I am considering purchasing DVD editing software, ripping these to my hard drive, add the missing/malplaced selections and burning my own.  I usually like to watch my DVD's multiple times but I am having a hard time making it through this series.  The sound and picture quality is excellent and I LOVE the show, but the DVD controls are just stupid!  They should fix these, or better yet, make them available for purchase on Amazon Instant Video!

2562752,1,B000FFJ8BM,This season was a great disappointment.  It seems the writers were hard up to come up with more stories and they took to the bizarre and ridiculous.  It was no where near as good as the first season.,1424736000,,199,4.2105263157894735

The unsavory side of humanity is revealed during these times, but we endure, as Pretender people must!  Stay steady in the face of ridicule meant to weaken the show you love!

Allow me to offer my opinion on this item, as this step is titled, on The Pretender season 4.  This has been my all-time favorite thing to watch, by far, and has been for many years.

Over the previous seasons Jared has grown in experience without losing the wonder of life.  Something that I find encouraging for my life.

2562799,4,B000FFJ8BM,"How is posible that a series with 4 seasons and 2 movies still not have any ending?? It's like you reading a book and when you turn the page the rest are all blank, let you in the middle of nowhere. Dont misunderstanding, the series is good and the characters are amazing, especially my favorite: Miss Parker. I blame the Pretender's writers because they ruin the story with to much secrets and never answer anything, they complicate the story to much and in some way started to be annoying. They kill the series and the movies, increasing the problem instead find a perfect ending. It's like they never knew how to ended. When the series was cancel the creators and writers announce 4 movies to end the story but the lack of ratings they just produced 2 of them, and even that they not did an ending, can you believe it??. All story needs an ending, a closer, no matter is a good ending or fatal ending, just need one. So if you was a fan of this series, well you can pass this, but if you are someone like me, someone who likes to see drama or supense but like to watch the story with a proper begin and a proper ending, so this series is not for you.  I blame myself for not doing a proper search to stop me to buy it. I don't like story with not closure,let you a bad taste...I hope I can help somebody...",1291161600,6,1309,4.2151394422310755

The cliff hanger at the end of the series is sad because to realize there won't be a season five to finish. The show had and has a huge fan base and will always be a great series to me.

I fell it is a shame that in the last show we see a set up for season five, and then they didn't get a renewal for season five. Where is the integrity of the network? If you are going to cut funding to a program that has had a four season run, don't you think it would be nice to have a special to close all the loops? I think there should be a 2 hours special to close out the series, before all the actors are any older.

At any rate, the show was losing its vitality and excitement in this overly contrived season.  Jarod continues to seek out wrongs, and try to right them by staging similar fates for the bad guys.  The show has too many bad guys and they only manage to get rid of two of them before the season ended.  If you enjoyed the first three seasons, youll probably want to watch just to see how many more times Parker lets Jarod pull the wool over her eyes.

2562839,4,B000FFJ8BM,"The Pretender was my favorite show, but in the last season I guess the writers were starting to run out of ideas so it got very strange, ""even for The Center"" as Broots would say.  Whether it was about the bizarre ""eating disorder"" of Mr Lyle or that ridiculous episode in which Broots and Miss Parker seem to have an affair, it's easy to see why the show was cancelled by the end of the season.  Still, some of the great things are there--the creepiness of the Centre; Ted Weiss who plays Jared as a nice, moral guy who has been a little warped by his experiences; and most of all Ms. Parker, a gun toting, hyper bitch who hounds poor Jared, trying to bring him back into captivity in the Centre, and yet some how thinks of herself as the good guy!  If you're a Pretender fan, you have to get this final season.",1155859200,,812,4.225806451612903
2562840,3,B000FFJ8BM,"Jarod was stolen from his parents thirty years before and raised by The Center, a shadowy organization filled with psychopaths and misfits, that used his genius for their own nefarious ends.  In Series One we see Jarod newly escaped, and in the following episodes he uses his ability to ""pretend"" to be others (essentially learning their skills and using such to solve crimes).  This is basically a stock detective soap opera, with the hero a lost and lonely outsider.  No points for realizing the intended audience was teenage boys...

There is enough material to make a good three-hour movie, but the script-writers wanted more.  They decided that not everyone at The Center would be out-and-out BAD.  So we get three characters who are initially ambiguous but who then over the interminable course of four series become increasingly GOOD: Miss Parker (the daughter of the guy who runs the Center, and who seems to spend half her life pointing guns at other people but never, ever, pulling the trigger), Sydney (Jarod's quasi-father psychiatrist) and Broots (lovable computer geek with a heart of jello).

The problem is that the script writers want to create emotional drama (yes, this is a soap after all) so they pile up one improbable scenario after another.  Jarod, meanwhile, tries to help Miss Parker learn the truth about her life, saves her life, and generally is an all-round angel - but she continues to try to find him and bring him back to the very Center that she knows is wracked with evil.  By the start of Series Three my family were making jokes about What Comes Next.  Will Mr Lyle (Miss Parker's evil brother) turn out to be Jack the Ripper?  Well, in fact you can't parody this series because yes, indeed, Mr Lyle does turn out to be Jack the Ripper.  But Miss Parker, though required to show revulsion (off-camera vomiting into the toilet), lacks the ability to do anything at all about her sibling's dietary predilictions.  Likewise when she learns who killed her mother, the best she can do is tiresomely point her 9mm and blather on and on and on about revenge, without ever being able to pull the trigger.  American movies and TV have always regarded firearms as a harmless prop akin to a lipstick tube or a popsicle, but Miss Parker takes the whole thing one step further so that her S&W 9mm is just part of her ""schtick"" along with 7"" Ferragamo shoes and an oscillating hair style.  At times I wondered whether the props guy had super-glued the gun to her hand by accident, forcing the script writers to invent more and more implausible reasons for her to wave the thing around in people's faces.

By the end of Series Four the whole concept has degenerated so far into the realm of unintentional self-parody that any viewer with normal brain function will be so bored by the conceit that the closing shot will come as a relief.  Although the script writers hoped for another series, the reality is that The Pretender was written out long before the network canceled the show.",1155772800,4,3006,4.727969348659004
