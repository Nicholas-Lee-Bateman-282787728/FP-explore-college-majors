8610363,2,B00EYO1ZES,"this was a disappointment and I felt the concept and the design was poorly thought out.  I could not finish watching
it, because it didnot change.  Basically what this is - is a camera on two very large ladies , one with her back
mostly to the camera, and a on a FREAKING computer monitor, which one can scarcely see , as they chatter away about
the history of iridology at what appears to be a workshop where people keep entering for attendance.  At tantalizing times
one thinks Oh, NOW they will show the screen the ATTENDEES are seeing- and what shows up is one of the large ladies
pointing upwards, while the viewer sees the blank bottom of a classroom filming screen.  I am going to return this
for a refund, it is that bad- I feel it qualifies as a malfunction.",1428364800,2,767,4.3426573426573425
