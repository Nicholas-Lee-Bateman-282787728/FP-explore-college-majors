This is a teaching DVD, perfectly delivered and with the perfect amount of information and energy!

I am recommending this video to my clients! A must have for your enlightened library.

Thoughts are things! Indeed

Glad I took the chance to see and hear, all of Mike's work.

If you like to see the full spectrum of his work, get yourself also other work of him. This DVD is great having, absorb what is said before you watch and order his latest stuff.
I am glad I took the chance to see all of Mike's work. If you like to see the full spectrum of his work, get this DVD and some of his cd's...Do yourself a favour!
Therafter move on to his latest DVD, ""Thoughts become Things"", which I find deserves a five star review, it's an awesome result of years progress, but first watch this DVD.

I defenitely can advise people to get it all, I am enjoying it.

4009860,5,B002XTXG8Y,"I love this DVD! Mike Dooley is a natural teacher who speaks with clarity and humor.  I felt totally motivated after viewing this. I think it would make a great companion DVD to the original ""The Secret"" movie, as it gives very tangible steps which you can take in order to manifest.  This is NOT WoooWooooo stuff here.  I cannot emphasize that enough.  We all manifest our lives all the time.  Mike Dooley just shows us a practical method for ""doing what we can, with what we have, from where we are"" in the MOST efficient way.  The end result is a life you're more happy with -- Outstanding!!!",1270771200,16,595,4.412844036697248

It's humorous, interesting, and has a lot of powerful advice that will set you on the right track toward your goals.

It was like was like watching a seminar in an auditorium with minimal graphics. Not much variety in backdrop..",1367798400,,274,4.851063829787234
8383863,5,B002XTXG8Y,"This dvd is one of my favorites. Its one of those teachings that keeps on unfolding new truth everytime you watch it. Weather you are new to understanding the law of attraction or have a knowledge base, Mike does a great job of sharing and speaking to all levels. This is one I buy and pass on to people. Its worth the money and more, it couldn't be easier:)",1324944000,,358,4.202898550724638

8383865,1,B002XTXG8Y,Mike Dooley is on roll to attract wealth using your wealth.  I did not find any of his book or advise useful or even practical. `,1292976000,,129,3.9615384615384617
8383866,2,B002XTXG8Y,Mike Dooley seems like a very nice gentleman so I hate to give a negative review - but the entire 72 minute video could have been condensed into five minutes.  Focus on the end result- let the universe handle the details.,1291161600,3,221,4.390243902439025

8383868,3,B002XTXG8Y,"I have followed Mike Dooley for years and have most of his materials. He is warm, funny, down to earth and a great teacher.  However, in this video he was being spontaneously translated into Spanish and his speech seemed slow and ponderous.
The lighting was not very good, with Mike standing in front of a dark curtain and looking like someone holding a flashlight under their chin.  He's terrific, but I was disappointed in the quality of the visual presentation. Next time, I'll find out if he's been filmed in another country before I purchase the video. I purchased this one from Amazon and I don't believe you can return videos after they have been viewed.",1279497600,5,661,4.689655172413793
