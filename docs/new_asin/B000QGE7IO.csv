8601631,4,B000QGE7IO,"I have waited for something along these lines and now it is here. But, here are the facts: Disc 1 is indeed a video history with commentary from the UK. With the exception of Geoff of Mojo Magazine the narration was almost unbearable as there is some sort of audio background muffled thunder from a nearby studio in session. Whenever Stevie is on there is a solid pumpkin orange frame or top and bottom borders around the video. The frames carry a likeness of Stevie at 12 in the lower left corner and run time is 55 min. Disc 2 has a sunburst frame with a late 70's likeness of Stevie in the lower right corner that constantly reduces diagonal 32 in. to a 20 in. picture, and is 45 min. long. Still, this is a must have collection for any fan and there's nothing even close to this compilation of british tv history on dvd elsewhere...so buy it now!",1344556800,,850,4.31875
