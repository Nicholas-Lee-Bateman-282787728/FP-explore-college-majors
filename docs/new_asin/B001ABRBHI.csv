3446677,4,B001ABRBHI,"This was an Italian made for television two part dramatisation of the real life of Giorgio Perlasca. I saw a UK version that was properly subtitled it has been pointed out that this version does not have English sub titles - please take note.

Perrlasca had fought for the Fascists in Abyssinia and Spain, his conduct was so commended that he was given an honorary safe conduct pass by Franco. He was motivated by his anti communist beliefs and his Catholic upbringing. He worked as a fresh produce supplier for the Italian army who were fighting on the Eastern front during World War II, when Italy surrendered he took the side of the King and not of the now deposed Mussolini.  This meant that he was no longer a friend of Germany and Hungary under the heel of Eichmann was doing all it could to appease its new uber Lords.

This film kicks off in Budapest in 1944, Perlasca played by Luca Zingaretti of `Inspector Montalbano' and `Cefalonia' fame has tried to escape it is only when he realises how hopeless his situation is that he remembers his Spanish safe conduct pass. So he hot foots it to the Spanish Embassy with two Jews he has befriended. In order to get safe passage he takes on Spanish citizenship and then, after an epiphany, he realises he can try to save some of the thousands of Jews that are being deported to Germany. This he does by giving them protectorate cards and letting them stay in Embassy safe houses of any neutral country that will help him. He also has to convince the Germans that he is actually a diplomat uses his strength of personality as a driving force for good.

The film has some great period pieces is really well acted and the music is by the legendary Ennio Morricone . There are some scenes that had me dewy eyed especially at his efforts to stop a train load of victims from the gas chambers. I have done some research and as far as I can tell this is an excellent and accurate adaptation of the biography called `Banality of Goodness' by Enrico Deaglio' which the film is based on after Perlasca finally told of what he had done in 1987 and his story came to the public's knowledge. He actually saved about four times as many Jews as Oskar Schindler and has been recognised for it by Hungary, Spain, Italy and Israel. A truly remarkable man and a great tribute to him in this 2002 production, that has finally had a release over here - absolutely recommended.",1364342400,48,2407,4.488584474885845
3446678,4,B001ABRBHI,"This is based upon a true story. I do not know the actual facts about this particular case. I found it a bit sentimental and squishy given the horrific subject.

3446694,4,B001ABRBHI,"It was a sentimental story of a retired soldier, now a businessman, during WWII.  He is confronted with the savagery of a dictatorship in the urban setting.  He is unhinged by the lack of honor and cruelty that officials rain on civilians.  His personality allows him to push back using his knowledge that lower ranks are afraid of displeasing superiors to have his way with both Hungarian officials and German soldiers.  His gumption surprises everyone and he saves the lives of many civilians.  It is a good ending movie, based on a true story.  It is worth seeing.",1477094400,2,567,4.73469387755102

At times I found it hard to follow, but the truth is he was trying to stay one step ahead, at all cost.  It was a terrible time and I got the feeling the story showed a fraction of what this man tried to accomplish.  Hard to watch in places.  How he stayed alive, one wonders?  It's worth watching to learn what this unselfish man tried at least to do.",1475280000,2,494,3.9393939393939394

I wonder how historically accurate and how ""dramatized"" the story was.  Apparently he succeeded in saving some handful but not the thousands shown in the movie.

Excellent film showing how Perlasca was able to save many Jewish men, women, and children in Hungary.

3446806,3,B001ABRBHI,"As dramatized history, it is successful.  Like most of the genre, it is more a collection of events than a story; since it follows events that actually happened there is nothing that could be called a plot.  I have to agree with another reviewer that everything was just a bit too easy for the title character; after awhile you just know that whatever it is, he is going to pull it off, so there is no suspense and very little ""how did he do it.""  It is also almost all action and almost no introspection or interior life of any characters.  Mostly, things happen, characters react, other things happen, etc.
The cinematography is excellent.
The problem of language was dealt with in a rather simplistic way; everyone--from Hungarians to Spaniards to Germans--speaks Italian.  My Italian is not good enough to say with absolute certainty that no one had an accent (Italian with a German accent, etc.) but it didn't seem so.  The result of this was to remove the cultural and linguistic barriers that would naturally exist in the situation; this in turn reduced the realism of the film.  It wouldn't have hurt to have a few people speaking German or Hungarian and it would have been far more realistic.",1443052800,7,1201,4.690476190476191

In addition, with Luca Zingaretti as the protagonist the whole movie had the feel, music, and direction of  one of his TV dramas, not an actual movie.

3446886,4,B001ABRBHI,"Up till now, I had never heard of the amazing heroism of an Italian cattle dealer named Giorgio Perlasca during the last year of WW II in Hungary. Stranded due to unforeseen circumstances, he sees the atrocities committed against the Jewish populace and decides to do something about it. Taking advantage of his status as a veteran of the Spanish war, he helps as many Jews as he can, placing them in safe homes, so that they would not be deported to the concentration camps. Even when he had the option to leave Hungary for safer refuge, he chose to stay behind to help the Jews. When the Spanish Charg d'Affaires (portrayed as the Spanish Ambassador in the film) has to leave Hungary for Switzerland, Perlasca opts to remain in Hungary, and fools the Nazis and the Arrow Cross (the Fascist organization in power in Hungary at the time) into believing he was the deputy left in charge.

It is estimated the Giorgio Perlasca saved around 5,000 Jews in Budapest from being deported/killed by the Arrow Cross and the Nazis. The movie may be 2 hours 4 mins. long but it is fast-paced and filled with many dramatic heart-stopping scenes. Some memorable ones include Perlasca confronting one of the Arrow Cross leaders, and bribing him into releasing Jews who had been forcibly taken from one of the safe houses; Perlasca rescuing two children from a transport and finding out later that the Nazi officer he spoke to was Adolf Eichmann; Perlasca valiantly wrenching Jews from being deported on cattle trains, and more.

The reason I took one star off is due to the fact that at times, it feels like the film, even at over 2 hours, tries to cram too much into the time frame, so that the viewer is left reeling, trying to take everything in. Perlasca is depicted as almost superhuman at times, and although I greatly admire this individual for risking his own life to save the helpless, I felt the movie could have toned down the super-heroism element a bit.

The film is nevertheless compelling, and covers a lot of historical events as unfolded during the war including the infamous scene where Jews were shot into the River Danube in Budapest. There is also some historical footage woven in such as the executions of the Arrow Cross leaders at the end of the war. The Arrow Cross members are depicted as being extremely cruel and sadistic which is borne out by real-life witness testimony, and their actions are even more deplorable considering they were Hungarians themselves, inflicting such pain and misery upon their own countryfolk.

Watching this film is painful and heartbreaking, but nevertheless a timely reminder that individuals can make a difference, and speaking up for what is right is never a wrong thing. It brings to mind a quote I heard in another Holocaust movie, Uprising, ""Can a moral man uphold his moral code in an immoral world?"" Individuals like Giorgio Perlasca prove that indeed, one can and must.",1390435200,12,2921,4.766798418972332

3446889,4,B001ABRBHI,"""Perlasca: The Courage Of A Just Man"" is a two-part drama, originally made for Italian TV, starring Luca Zingaretti in the title role, directed by Alberto Negrin and originally screened in 2002. The story is taken from the book by Enrico Deaglio, itself a narrative of the heroism of Georgi Perlasca, an Italian import/export agent who, whilst working in Hungary trying to secure supplies of mutton for the Italian government, finds himself trapped in an occupied Budapest after the capitulation of Italy to the Allies in December 1944. Initially concerned only with his own escape and return home, Perlasca quickly finds himself embroiled in the underground harbouring of Jews seeking to avoid the death camps of the occupying Nazis.  The version for the English-speaking market presents the film in Italian with English subtitles only. The subtitling is good enough most of the time, but is hardly rendered in idiomatic English, occasionally reduces almost to gibberish, and sometimes fails to fit on the screen! This is, however, rarely any real problem.

Given its subject matter, the film invites the drawing of obvious parallels with Steven Speilberg's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List-1993/dp/B00B0URLOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List [1993</a>]""; such parallels are, however, merely superficial; the treatment of the subject matter, particularly Negrin's refusal to shy away from portrayal of the suffering and brutality inflicted by the occupying forces, could hardly be more different. Also, having two ninety-minute episodes at his disposal in which to cover the events of just 45 days allows for a more intimate and moving examination of the actions and motivations of the eponymous protagonist than was available to Speilberg, with 6 year's worth of events to cram into the same running time. The result is a more flowing and dramatic narrative, with less of an episodic feel and somehow more laced with pathos. The natural break in the middle also comes a welcome breather for those not wanting to take the drama in a single 3-hour sitting.

Luca Zingaretti does a wonderful job of conveying the tireless determination -- and extraordinary humility -- of a man driven by desperation and a strong sense of humanity to carry out ever more audacious acts in the defence of the innocent. The overall message behind the film is positive and uplifting -- a dramatisation, essentially, of John Stuart Mill's assertion that ""bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing"" -- but that said, nothing about this story is presented as sugar coated. It offers no real celebration of the saving of some five thousand souls but rather a muted mourning of all those who could not be saved.

The short addition at the end of an interview with the real-life Georgi Perlasca for Italian TV shortly after his heroic actions had been revealed to the world for the first time in the late 1980s -- actions of which he himself made light -- is also a very moving addition.

3446896,4,B001ABRBHI,"I guess two things attracted me to this film; one was the story of Georgio Perlasca, and his attempt to save innocent life's of many thousands of Jews from the Nazi extermination camps, in the later part of World War 2. To my shame I had never heard about Georgio Perlasca selfless humanitarian efforts until reading a Wikipedia entry. The second reason for my interest was the Italian actor Luca Zingaretti, his performances in Montalbano the crime drama series, are `par excellence', and I am a real fan of series.

Without giving plot spoilers I found that this film seemed to be made more for Television as opposed to a cinematic release, there is nothing fundamentally wrong in this. The film is nearly 200 hundred minutes long; some may need to view this production in segments. Some see subtitles as a chore, but I can assure you that to see and hear productions as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable.

Perlasca becomes hell-bent on their rescue.  Assuming any diplomatic identity necessary, he ferociously and heroically confronts any enemy official to get the job done. Having fought in the Spanish Civil War, he applies his proof of service and skills of wit and persuasion to gain entree into the Spanish embassy and, therein, provide shelter for the Jews.  Flush with cash for cattle, he will find a new purpose for it.  There are so many twists and turns, near-victories, suddenly dashed by defeat, and back and forth. For me, I wish I could have thanked  this glorious unintended warrior with the huge heart.  Perlasca died in Padua, Italy in 1992.",1524009600,2,1114,5.230337078651686

Perlasca had gotten special status due to his war time in Spain and used that immunity to help Jews escape Hungary.  His charm, wit and quick-talking deals got many Jews out to safety, but there were some disappointments.  He placed his own life in danger a few times.

What's really depressing is how one sees several families in this film and one sees them survive.  They make by with tenacity and hold on to their dreams, but not all make it.  It's like watching Schindler's list in Italian-Spanish.

Having just learned of Perlasca, I haven't yet had the opportunity to research the accuracy of this account.  Nevertheless, I don't know why it would be embellished.

As far as the movie is concerned, I think that there were a few places (very few) where it could have been better edited, but nothing too serious.

Reading some of the negative reviews, it appears that this is another instance where some were critical because of the product, e.g. defective DVD.  That is fair criticism for the ""product.""  I also see that there were complaints because it is not an English movie and as such required subtitles for an English audience, which should have been no surprise.  Critiques like that do not consider the historical significance of the content.  I could never hear of the suffering of people, as is represented herein, and call it ""boring.""
