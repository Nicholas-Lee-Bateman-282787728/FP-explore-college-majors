8680150,3,6303447686,I've been playing soccer for years and never had a coach show such good drills. The video is set up nicely. My kids like to watch it and then go out and do the drills. I give it two thumbs up!,985824000,10,192,3.707317073170732
8680151,4,6303447686,"Pros: Covers most aspects that other videos miss. Shows in real time moves and manuevers - both on the go and set plays that every team must master. I  liked it so much I'm purchasing Vol 1.
Cons: Some loss of continuity from  one activity to another. Rather a series of drills/exercises than an  overall strategy/progression.
Bottom line: Lots of really good stuff for  coaches and players. Money well spent!",967766400,10,409,4.8
