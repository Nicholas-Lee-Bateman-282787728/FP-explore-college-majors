7909071,3,B00000G3P1,"I find the Amazon editorial's choice of comparison ridiculous. Beavis & Butthead old and tired?
Since when are Stone & Parker original? If it wasn't for Cartman, South Park would be anything but watchable. Episode after episode of same old toilet humor, and B&B are the ones that are tired?
I've been a big fan of the timeless duo, and I also started watching South Park when it first came out. I couldn't keep myself interested for more than 13 episodes - the show is ridiculously repetitive, if not downright unfunny at times (Mech Barbra Streisand? Yeah, whatever... ""They killed Kenny!""? Yawn). Conversely, I'm totally clueless as to why Judge never made any movies following Office Space (easily one of the funniest movies and truest social commentary ever made).
Anyway... This video would have been one-of-a-kind, if the music video's weren't missing. The videos were an integral part of the show - especially if you think back to such gems as If I Only Had A Brain (MC 900ft Jesus) and No More I Love You's (Annie Lennox).
Taking out the videos should be considered a crime, though given volatile copyright issues, I'm not too surprised. One can only hope that a comprehensive episode collection will someday be released.",1020556800,3,1229,4.885167464114833
