1177627,5,B0000039N9,Every piece of crap Pauly Shore ever made is available on DVD but a top notch made for TV movie like this one isnt?There cant  be a God in the universe to allow a injustice like this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1313452800,2,197,4.324324324324325
1177628,5,B0000039N9,This is an excellent movie. The characters are so twisted that it's hard to believe this is a true story.,1291248000,,105,4.3
1177629,4,B0000039N9,"To those from the King of Prussia Area (like myself), there are references and allusions to places (VF park, etc.) and some interesting exaggerated portrayal of characters, some of which I had for teachers (Pat Schnure, Vince Valaitis)

To those not from the area, it is still a sickening psychological drama that will keep you locked to the TV for the full 4+ hours (ended up watching it till 3 in the morning).  The outcome is known, but the choppiness of the plot keeps the viewer actively watching, trying to figure out what has happend, and what is about to happen.  The end of the movie with the cases ties everything together to leave the viewer highly satisfied.  For those who like intellectually stimulating movies, a must-see.  For those who are more interested in comedy, thrills, or screams, you'll turn it off in the first 10 minutes.",1107388800,14,848,4.741496598639456
1177630,3,B0000039N9,"Dated, by todays standards, but still compelling.  First half is interesting, and you are glued to the screen trying to absord the information given by Coyote's character, yet hoping he turns out to be the good guy.  Little by little we're given bits and pieces of what happened, but only through Coyote's character, who turns out to be a manipulating deceiver, cold and scary with his Manson like powers over less experienced people. The second half is confusing, and Coyote and Loggia are off screen for nearly forty minutes.  In the ending court-room drama, we don't see a flashback or re-inactment of what ""supposedly"" happened to this female school teacher and her two children.  I guess both Coyote's character, Bill Bradfield, and Loggia as Dr. Smith did commit the crime.  But, we as viewers don't feel or see any concrete evidence, and this leaves something to be desired.  Based on a true story that took place in 1979 in Pennsylvania, and a case that lasted seven years.  Just too many questions left unanswered.  Yet, Loggia is awesome, and scary (wait until you see those ""eyes"".) And it's always a pleasure to see Peter Coyote, a very under-rated actor.  I don't know...maybe I should've read the book instead.",1033084800,9,1224,4.874396135265701

7902360,5,B0000039N9,"Some reviews say poor quality VHS. Well obliviously what can one expect. This movie mini series is put on tape by Starmaker entertainment, in the extended play mode (EP). It they have put the movie in the standard mode (SP) on two VHS tapes. You'd definitely will get good picture quality. I rated 5 stars because this is a great TV movie.",1488844800,,339,4.483870967741935

7902362,5,B0000039N9,I remember this when it came out. It's a true story and they put it into a mini series. Peter Coyote is an amazing actor anyway. But this is a really well done suspense movie.,1386460800,,175,4.0285714285714285

7902364,4,B0000039N9,The book held a morbid fascination that led me to do Google searche for more info - then I doscovered the VHS (no DVD) rendition that brought this true crime story to life - it is chilling to know that scum buckets like this exist in a modern society.,1373414400,,251,4.142857142857143
7902365,5,B0000039N9,"Peter Coyote's,  Robert Loggia's & Stockard Channing are great. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Peter Coyotes reference to B Smith does at times get on one's nerves.",1370995200,,166,5.148148148148148

7902367,1,B0000039N9,"I ordered the DVD format of this movie, paid nearly $30 and then discovered that it would not operate in either a blu ray player or a standard player.  I don't know what kind of player would be needed, but all I can say is caveat emptor!!!!!!!!!",1340755200,,245,4.212765957446808
