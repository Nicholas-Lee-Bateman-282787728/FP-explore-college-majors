8272882,5,B001993Y72,Very compelling television. Emphasis on the complex character of Chris.,1469318400,,71,6.2
8272883,5,B001993Y72,Why can't they make shows like this anymore? They address the issues of the day without it being political even though it sometimes is. But the show is wonderful and I'm sure won many Emmys when it ran!!!!!! I didn't realize that in the first season that Meg Foster was Cagney!!!! So glad that they changed cast members in the next season because I can't even watch season one!!! Tyne Daly and Shaeon Gless are magical together!!!! They had 36 Emmy nominations and won at least 15!!!!! One of the best shows from the 80's!!!!,1464825600,,525,4.536842105263158

8272890,5,B001993Y72,"I am so tired of waiting for my favs to come to video.  What's amazing is some of the truly bad crap that is out.

Give me the rest of Cagney and Lacey, Hill Street Blues.  Get China Beach, Sisters, thirtysomething and Lou Grant out on DVD.

I guarnetee that if you did, that you'd get customers for the holiday shopping season.

Personally they'd all be on my holiday shopping list.",1221868800,5,383,4.338028169014085
