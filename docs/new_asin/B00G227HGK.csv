The film shows a gambling ship used for a charity event. The Charles' play and win at roulette. The band leader has an issue with the lead clarinet player. This band leader owes a pile of money ($12,000) that must be paid back soon - or else. A man enters a cabin to break into a locked chest. A gun shoots him. The murder of Tommy Drake makes front page news. At home Nicky Jr. must practice the piano, not play baseball. His refusal calls for a spanking.

Phil Brant is wanted for the murder. He just got married to a wealthy heiress. After they arrive at the Charles' the police show up to arrest him. Nick explains his reasons. So now Nick will investigate the murder. Nick visits the gambling ship to view the crime scene. [Note how a double is used for stunts and rough action.] The film shows musicians gathering for a good time. No drinking or smoking for these hep cats. Has a receipt for $12,000 gone up in smoke?

Mr. Thayer tells Nick about an antique gun. [This is not the revolver shown earlier!] There is a phone call that takes Mrs. Brant away. Nick deduces the address written on a paper pad. A clue brings Nick and Nora to Poughkeepsie NY. They find Buddy Hollis at a rest home; his mind is ""shattered"". Can anyone believe what he says? They discover a clue on the trip back home to Manhattan. Nick thinks up a ruse to expose the killer. [False clues have been spread around.] The suspects are all assembled on the gambling ship. There is a confession and a surprise ending. [Does it remind you of ""Murder, My Sweet""?]

This film is not as good as the earlier films. It is the last of the series, but a better story could have perhaps avoided this [unless that was its purpose]. This story seems to wander too much and waste the viewer's time. But its all right for fans of this series.",1490659200,,1837,4.315942028985507
