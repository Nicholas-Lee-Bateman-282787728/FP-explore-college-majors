However, the big problem was with their conclusion.  They claimed to know exactly who the headless Romans were.  Their chosen method of mystery-solving consisted of the following steps: 1) they looked at the skeletons and theorized about who they were 2) they read about an event that took place in Roman-British history around the same time and place that the skeletons were thought to be from and 3) they conjectured that the headless Romans were none other than the people in the historical event.

That is very poor mystery-solving.  It is an interesting and plausible theory, but the film makers should have clearly presented their idea as a theory, not a fact or a definite answer to the question of who the skeletons were.",1233532800,,943,4.968152866242038
8190981,4,B000PFUA7I,"I almost had to wipe my eyes.  I said to myself, ""Is the actor playing the new Emperor positioning himself for number one!?""  And sure enough, the narrator states, with no sarcasm, ""The Emperor was murdered while trying to relieve himself.""  And modern Hollywood thinks they created gross-out moments!  For this hilarity alone, you should see this documentary.

In all seriousness, forensic scientists, archaeologists, and historians try to figure out the facts behind a grave with about 40 decapitated bodies in it.  It's amazing what humans can deduce from the past.  They could examine teeth to learn from what regions the deceased came.  They looked at a cup and could immediately tell from which century it was made.

When some uninformed viewers see all the people of color in this work, they may scream, ""P.C.!""  They would be wrong: Ancient Rome was multiethnic and multiracial.  The narrator mentioned that the first emperor was part Libyan and had a foreign wife.  The two sons of the first emperor are portrayed as being of different racial backgrounds.  Though the work said little of Roman and ancient British women, half of the experts here were women.  Wearing my feminist cap, I was excited about the gender diversity here.  Still, I was very shocked to see a scientist with European dreadlocks, tattoos, and body piercings.  She looked more like a female Blink-182 member than an erudite expert.

Some of the actors wore beards and that surprises me as I heard that Ancient Romans thought of beards as barbaric.  (Notice the ""barber"" in ""barbaric."")  These reenactments were mostly well-done.  They show Romans burning a British camp and you see many shelters in flames, not just one shot at multiple angles.  Unfortunately, the narrator says many people attended an execution and they only show about 6 people present in the reenactment.

Sometimes documentaries leave me non-plussed, but I really liked this one.  It was of high quality.",1199232000,,1956,5.024922118380062
