It tried to hard to be mysterious and clever, but in the end it was just a confusing film that stumbled from one plot device to the next.",1439164800,,253,3.9607843137254903
8510932,5,B0076FR6IQ,"This is an excellent Slovinian neo-noir, more an existential character study
than a thriller, as a troubled cop is drawn into the obsessive wake of an open & shut sober suicide case. Told more in images than exposition this film blossems with repeated viewings and really shows how less can be so much more at a running time of 70 minutes!",1363651200,,339,4.573770491803279
8510933,1,B0076FR6IQ,"I like international movies. I looked forward to this one. Maybe I am too stupid to get it. The film looks great and the acting is good but it is way too confusing. In the end, I did not know if the detective killed himself or he was the person at the very beginning but at that point I was frustrated and not happy with spending 90 minutes watching this. There are so many other great movies, see some of my reviews, why bother with this.",1346630400,,439,4.116279069767442
