4331366,5,B004D4A09K,"Wow, so much information ... so, so much information!! To be honest, I wasn't expecting the way the information was presented, for some reason I thought it would be displayed in a somewhat dry, bits and bytes manner so when I slipped in the first disc I positioned myself in front of the TV, pen in hand wanting to jot things down ... Wrong!

The information has a good flow to it, it is presented by the travelers themselves therefore you get the info right from the horse's mouth (so to speak).  I found the best way to view these DVDs is to watch them in the same way you would watch movies at home, make yourself some popcorn grab a drink, sit back on the couch and enjoy. The information is well segmented into meaningful chapters with references back to the HU website if you want to do a deep dive on the information.

Well presented, informative and enjoyable ... a good piece of work!!",1310169600,3,894,4.373493975903615
4331367,5,B004D4A09K,"If you have read any books about taking long trips on a motorcycle, whether it be to camp with friends, take a vacation/holiday break, or if you dream of something much more exotic such as a visit to other countries or continents - get these and watch them before setting off.

The whole series in this collection comprises 5 DVDs in total, and they all reinforce each other with overly repeating themselves. They include contributuions from well known, respected and  famous riders (Ted Simon, Dr. Greg Frazier), as well as the typical average (and often middle aged !!) motorcycle riders - both male and female. The tales and experiences are fun to listen to, and great to learn from.

Each of the DVDs are very well presented and organized. Each DVD menu is organized with topics that resemble a very useful table of contents, making it clear and easy to jump from topic to topic (if you are skimming subjects for instance), or if you need to stop and then restart it at a later date.

Buy one or buy them all, according to taste and your needs. Read reviews of them here, or browse through the Horizons Unlimited website where Grant and Susan Johnson host one of the most useful motorcycle travel websites in the globe.

My personal thanks to them for making this and the other ""Acheivable Dream"" DVDs, over-committing themselves to making and delivering the series means that the motorcycling community has a wonderful, permanent reference series. Cheers, Adrian C. Wright",1292457600,3,1477,4.799212598425197
4331368,5,B004D4A09K,"Lately, I've become very interested in buying and watching DVDs about Motorcycle Adventure travel.  Some of these videos have been really great (Long way Down/'Round) and some have been pretty horrible.  So, when I ordered this set of DVDs from Horizons Unlimited, I was not really sure what I would end up with.  The reviews were positive for this box set, but I had been let down before, with some of the DVDs that I had purchased having really poor production quality.  Even with the risk that the DVD might not be very good, I decided I would take a chance, and see what Grant and Susan had to offer.  And so, it was with a healthy dose of skepticism that I purchased the 5 DVD box set.

When I opened the box, and began watching the videos, I discovered a completely different type of Motorcycle DVD.  These DVDs were not an adventure travelogue, as the other were, but instead, the videos presented different points of view on virtually every possible topic within the world of Adventure and Motorcycle travel.  The DVD set is a compilation of thoughts, ideas and comments from the people that have been doing adventure touring for years and years.  The topics were well organized, and logically sequenced.  The DVDs were made so that you could buy each DVD separately, covering one topical area, or purchase the box set, and immerse yourself in everything related to adventure touring.

I would say that the 5 DVD set seems to cover every topic imaginable for anyone that is interested in going on an adventure tour.  All of the folks that were interviewed were warm, inviting, and knowledgeable.  I would even say that a few of them were ""real characters"" but that's part of the charm of this DVD.  Not all of the interviewees agree on how to solve a particular problem, but they all have a point of view that is based in their own practical experience.

The folks interviewed are from all walks of life, and range in age from about 35 - 70 years old.  So, you get a very nice cross-section of opinions, from folks with varied agendas, and varied objectives.

I can't recommend these DVDs highly enough.  Buy the set, enjoy the content, and you'll find that when you go on your tour, this DVD will have saved you money, frustration, time, or simply made your trip better.",1378944000,2,2279,4.599009900990099
4331369,5,B004D4A09K,"The title ""Achievable Dream"" is certainly an appropriate title as these DVDs spell out exactly what is needed for long distance motorcycle travel, whether national or international...whether you are just learning to tour, or a seasoned veteran.

Although I have over a million miles under my belt, I found many new tips on these DVDs that will most certainly help out locally, and will prove invaluable crossing borders into the unknown.

This is just plain good stuff.",1378857600,,469,5.077922077922078
4331370,5,B004D4A09K,"I watched all of the videos and repeated most of the videos at least 4-5 times.  I anticipate watching them a few hundred times.  These videos are inspiring.  I purchased a single to give to my brother to introduce him.

I took one trip that seemed dificult and now plan another.",1375660800,,279,4.411764705882353
4331371,5,B004D4A09K,"At 68 I'm a little late into the MC Adventure set and may not fully achieve the Dream but with this set of DVD's it will not be for lack of knowledge. Wonderfully produced and outstanding material from the actually people who are achieving the Dream of MC Adventure. Not only is this one of my best buys it is one of my most used. Every time I watch it something new appears. Grant and Susan Johnson have given me the opportunity to learn from the famous and not so famous world travelers how to prepare and how to approach traveling on MC. I'm not a novice rider as I have > 300k miles traveled, but as a world traveler, I'm a newbie and this set seriously helps. I think the format of involving many diverse rider/couples provides a consolidated and open exposure to the experiences they have had and what they would have done differently. I've yet to watch the last dvd but the previous 6 have giving me so much info and wisdom I may never be a world traveler but I will be a better traveler. I only wish I'd been able to experience the ""Achievable Dream"" much earlier in my life. Whether your planning a world tour or just a tour of a few states this is worth viewing. One of my all time best buys, Thanks Grant and Susan for doing it and Amazon for making it so available.",1374364800,,1277,4.237704918032787
4331372,5,B004D4A09K,"I received these videos as a present and it is one of the most enjoyable gifts I have received. Grant and Sue Johnson, of Horizon Unlimited, do an exceptional job of pulling in a variety of information from a diverse set of people who have lived the dream of riding motorcycles around the world. I have viewed these videos several times and have learned something new each time. There are contradictory recommendations made, because no two motorcyclist can agree on everything, but one fact prevails...you can achieve your dream of traveling the world by motorcycle. The thing that has stuck with me is that 95% of the worlds roads are unpaved. This has inspired me to take an off road motorcycle course in Colorado this summer. I highly recommend these videos to anyone considering taking a journey by motorcycle, no matter where it made lead you.",1368403200,2,848,4.815068493150685
4331373,5,B004D4A09K,"I must say that these DVDs have provided me with invaluable knowledge as well as others' insights about their trip. I also get to learn about the different riding cultures in different regions.

I would recommend these DVDs to all riders out there who are tourers and are looking to tour around the world!

Good job, Horizons Unlimited! Your views of the world have inspired me to be unlimited in my goals!

4331374,5,B004D4A09K,"Brilliant, all the information you require to prepare for a major overland journey. Down to earth presentation, factual, detailed and presented well.",1357776000,,149,5.818181818181818
4331375,5,B004D4A09K,"We bought these a few months ago and spend evenings watching them over and over. A ""must see""if you are planning a trip and a ""should see"" if you just want to have sanity break from life.",1349568000,,187,4.081081081081081
4331376,5,B004D4A09K,"I ordered this set in the hope that it would give me some idea what I'm facing when it comes to making my motorcycle adventure dreams a reality. I have only watched the first video, but I learned quite a bit. Let's say, I have a lot of things to get in order before I can make this happen -- daunting but not impossible. And I think that's the purpose of this video series -- to give you a shot of reality, but at the same time, demonstrate that the dream is achievable. The videos primarily focus on the first hand accounts of riders like you and me and take into account varying perspectives on two-wheel (and sometimes more) overland travel. I am sure I will watch these videos over and over again as they have more detail than you can catch on the first time around. What would make this series really awesome, would be an accompanying book and/or a one-year trial membership to Horizons Unlimited.com! As I watch more of this series, I will update my review.",1316995200,4,963,4.385474860335195
4331377,5,B004D4A09K,"Wasn't sure when we bought this set what we would be getting, but after watching it we were pleased with it and would reccommend watching it to anyone who is planning a motorcycle trip into a foreign country. If you have never done this before, it gives great detail on what you need for the trip and how to go about getting all the paperwork. I could go on and on, so I'll stop and say yes yes yes to watching this again and again.",1312156800,2,432,4.094117647058823

These information are first hand information.
I also appreciate their site.  when I have contacted them I received comments from Suzan and Grant which gave me a good feeling that I am considered as important for HU community.

There is a lot of stories and technical data which are more than helpful to get before leaving for a journey.  It worth the expense and more ..... It is really professional.
Thanks Susan and Grant",1397433600,,502,4.670454545454546
8424745,5,B004D4A09K,"Hi,

If your planning to venture off on a motorcycle then you owe it to yourselves to get a set of these DVD's. I got the whole box set and I suggest you do the same because there is loads of info to be found in them.

Most of the content is interview based so your getting information from the folks that are out there 'doing it'. I noticed that a lot of the riders got 'stuck in' even without having a great deal of experience.

Just sitting on your couch watching these DVD's is like having an adventure on its own!

Money well spent and enjoyed every minute of them. Thanks to everyone involved.

Regards

8424746,5,B004D4A09K,"This is by far the most instructional video series I have ever found. It provides clear and understandable information to chase away some of the fears involved in planning a monumental trip such as an RTW or Transcontinental journey via motorcycle. All of the  interviews from my motorcycle heroes such as Greg Frazier, Ted Simon, Austin Vince and Lois Pryce are spectacular. I didn't expect so much information to be jam packed into this DVD series. I can only imagine these 18 hours are only a small sample of what can be learned at a Horizons Unlimited get together. :)

I feel even more ready to take the chance and tackle a few border crossings, deal with breakdowns, provide first aid and generally expand my horizons past my day to day life by truly tackling a long distance motorcycle journey.

If you have any ember starting to burn in your brain regarding doing this kind of trip, fan it into an inferno by buying and watching this series. You will not regret it. If you don't think you can do it, you will learn you can. Man, woman, handicapped, what have you, you can do it. This series will show you how and prove that others like you have given it a go and succeeded.",1389657600,,1181,4.4837209302325585
8424747,4,B004D4A09K,"This DVD set seems to achieve its objective of covering most topics about moto trips, mainly through interviews and conferences from what I've seen (3 first DVDs up to now). But I let a warning for those who would feel concerned : I though I have a quite good level of english, but it's definitely not enough to correctly understand what is said, and unfortunately there is no subtitles available.
Anyway, enjoy it !",1388880000,,416,4.635135135135135
8424748,5,B004D4A09K,"I have watched this video set at least a dozen times over the last 2 years. Usually between motorcycle trips around North America. They have given me the information and confidence to schedule my first overseas motorcycle trip for this coming January, Australia. I love the casual format, as though you are sitting around a campground just soaking up the stories of the veteran travelers.",1385683200,,388,4.984615384615385
