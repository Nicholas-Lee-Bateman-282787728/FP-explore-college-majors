5273933,2,B0096PBCGG,"I am not sure where to start. This is a very bad film, but has some camp value. The film takes place in the year 2532. We know robots have taken over all of our tasks, but we don't know anything about society or why there is a desert between Philadelphia and New York, why it is called the Philadelphia Desert, or why the young Prince of England is there being held captive by a robot. Afterwards, a group of humans take on the task of rescuing an android and whatever humans they can find from a rogue AI manufacturing facility which looks like a large 20th century metal frame warehouse complete with office cubicles and marks-a-lot eraser boards.

The crew takes their orders from a man (David Ian Lee) with a varying bad German accent, Elvis chops and a Hitler mustache. The android they rescue (Sarah-Doe Osborne) is one of those jerk your head around androids. The special effects were made worse once it got to the editors where they ensured the sounds of gun fire and the CG gun flames hopelessly don't match. There is a ""Star Wars"" type light laser. Sometimes it uses a blue CG light, but in battle the laser looks like it is plastic pea green.  There were a lot of pauses as if the actors forgot their lines. Oh yes. The film has a twist, but at that point, who cares? Virginia Logan is the main actor in this one. She runs around showing off her bare midriff. Her name is Foxwell, perhaps to make us think about a low budget ""Transformers"" Megan Fox. She tried to carry the film, but it was just too much of a stinker.

The film is worse than a SyFy production or Asylum. The beginning has a long narration about robots and likewise the ending has an extremely long boring narration followed by the movie credits...Seriously, who does that? 8th graders?

The DVD cover says ""brief nudity"" which is kind of odd, because the film itself has no nudity. It does have B&W nudity at the very beginning to present the film logo, but none in the main body of the film.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Aforesaid nudity. $9.96 Walmart. They took me. Might sell well in states where pot is legal.",1357516800,3,2098,4.424870466321243
5273934,3,B0096PBCGG,"My initial reaction was that it sucks. In fact, I stopped it after the
first 10 minutes of the movie and called my cable provider to demand a
refund. They had the audacity to charge $4.99 for this 24 hour rental.
The rep I spoke with refused to refund me. I went to bed, got up the
next day, and gave it another try. I figured I paid for it, I may as
well watch it. I'm a big sci-fi fan and I can tolerate a lot of
absurdity with bad acting and poor special effects so long as the story
line is engaging. After my initial shock, I'd have to say that I was
entertained. I'll give this one 3 stars. It's definitely not in the
same class as Terminator, Matrix, I-Robot, or even Lost In Space
(""Danger, Will Robinson!""). But if you like sci-fi more for engaging
your imagination than wowing your eyeballs, then this may be
entertaining for you. It was for me.",1353024000,5,855,4.156626506024097
5273935,1,B0096PBCGG,Android Insurrection -- Too bad there is not a zero rating.  Bad dialogue.  Bad effects.  It looks like it was made by a teenager with no money.  This movie is a waste of money theirs and yours.,1351036800,4,194,4.162162162162162
5273936,1,B0096PBCGG,"This product represents the negative flip side of technology - making it affordable and so easy to use that any dysfunctional nutter can create and market a ""movie"". Only very rarely does something interesting get produced. The overwhelming vast majority of the time something like this pile is pooped out.

I will say that if (an exceedingly large 'IF') if Director Andrew Bellware's intent is to become the new Schlock King, attempting to secure Ed Wood's crown for himself, then he needs to be more sublime in his productions; a greater effort toward self-awareness by proudly taking ownership of lousy filmmaking. Not unlike the Tromaville Team.

Because as of right now, and the half dozen garbage piles in his resum, he's trying very hard to make actual movies and failing miserably at it.

This flick is notable for one thing only: Having the only R-rated production logo I have ever screened.

8536779,3,B0096PBCGG,"In the 23rd century, advancements in science have led to the creation of an indestructible killing machine. Soldiers living on an alien infested planet must battle those who have become self-aware and seek to destroy all of humanity.

I've written about this before in many other low-budget film reviews but I honestly think that the general populace is so spoiled on big budget affairs anymore that they don't give low-budget films a chance. If you're like me and you dig watching low-budget films; you'll notice that, practically, every one has a long list of haters reviewing it stating how bad that it is.

Android Insurrection is one of those sci-fi films you'll either like, love, or hate but, regardless, you probably won't change your mind about it. As for my opinion on it, well- much like Alien Dawn, AI is entertaining for the 83 minutes that it lasts. It's acting and plot were okay. Special effects were good. Also like Alien Dawn, it feels uninspired and generic at times(which is my only gripe). Course, it is a good waste of 83 minutes. I've seen far worse films in my day. It reminded me of a cross between War of the Worlds & I, Robot but not quite.

At any rate, it's probably another film that I'd only watch once and not give it another look. Even so, though, it is still worth a look if you're a sci-fi fan.",1368489600,,1329,4.552301255230126
8536780,1,B0096PBCGG,"This is a very cheaply made Phase4 studio film.  Bad acting, bad script, 60s effects.  1 of 3 Phase4 videos I made the mistake of purchasing.",1366329600,,141,4.384615384615385
8536781,3,B0096PBCGG,"It seems that no matter what movie I watch that I like, it seems like everybody else hates it. They complain that the acting is bad, and horrible effects. If that is what you want then just only see the movies at the theater. You obviously don't like cheesy B rated movies. I enjoyed this film. It was a good idea and I liked the story. Being a syfy novelist, my new syfy novel, ""The Day the Earth Cried,"" comes out MAy of 2013. I relish that syfy movies are still being made and I guess I'm not that crtical of them as other people are.",1365379200,,537,4.0754716981132075
8536782,1,B0096PBCGG,"This movie wouldn't pass being rated as a ""B"" movie, it was so bad. From poor acting, to really poor props, and special effects, it rates way down the list with movies like ""The Item"". Save your money, unless you like root canals, etc., as you will think you are having one within the first ten minutes of viewing this.",1362614400,,319,4.333333333333333
8536783,1,B0096PBCGG,"I have seen bad movies and this is one of them. The effects are terrible! Must have been done by kids. Many errors that don't stand up - for instance if this story in the future why are the actors wearing cloths from today? And why are the guns from our time? And the walkie-talkies?  Really? Terrible then they show a space ship!  Doesn't add up. Oh and the colonel is a german accent and a Hitler mustache!  OMG

I tried 2 times to watch this piece of junk and I quit - I can use my time to do something better like clean toilets!

I do not recommend buying this, or even watching it. If someone gives you this movie as a gift they are not your friends!

DO NOT BUY!",1362441600,,668,4.0227272727272725
8536784,3,B0096PBCGG,"That actors mostly like like college students and mostly freshman at that.  They couldn't have much experience, the acting is second rate.  The SX varies greatly.  Some CGI was decently done.  And the costumes... they must have just gone to the mall and grabbed whatever they could afford.  But I stayed with it and after 30 minutes or so I found that I was enjoying it.  Once was enough.  It will be a long time before I watch it again.  I do think that at $10 (roughly) it is over-priced and I think you should save your money for a better film. But if it move to Prime and you can watch it for free, it wouldn't hurt to give it a whirl.",1361664000,,639,4.138211382113822
8536785,5,B0096PBCGG,"At first it really seemed like a genuinely bad movie. I almost turned it off. Then I realized that it must have had very very low budget. I barely got through it the first time, then found myself curious to see it again. So I watched it a second time and REALLY liked it. We are so used to high budget expensive special effects well acted movies. This movie had none of that at all. But because it didn't the director had to work with what they had. Considering this, the second time through, the special effects and acting seemed a lot better. The way the story was told was even intriguing. It certainly had a Phillip K. Dick kind of feel to it. They took a very simplistic issue and turned it into an artful film. If you are used to the normal film formula, you probably won;t like it very much. But if you look at it a a low-budget indie, it is an excellent movie!!!!",1360454400,,871,4.190476190476191
8536786,1,B0096PBCGG,"Let me start by saying wow. Bad and in no good way? I am glad it cost me nothing but my time, ok that was over priced but I think to comment on other reviews about this product would be the best review of this product. Comment on nudity in the film was made, I do not believe it was clarified but what I saw I believe was the logo for Pandora Machine Films Production; sorry, it was the best part of this movie. You know how some movies are so bad they are entertaining, maybe funny or thought provoking. Not this one. You know how some movies are just bad and you feel you might be able to forgive them, not this one. They do as in one reviewers keen observation use the F word a bit more than probably needed, but then they needed the R rating. Now for some positive words on the release. It (the dvd) does come in a sturdy case. The artwork on the outside of the case is nice. It does appear to be a quality disk, just the disk, although the disk is not a rewritable so you are stuck with the Pandora Machine Films into scene of the nude in antique black and white as the only good part of the film. Believe the reviews on this page, if you are reading this before buying, you probably don't want to do that. If you do buy, let me know what you think by using the comment on this review button. I was about to list a couple films I felt this one was trying to copy, but honestly I feel it would be an injustice to the other films to have their names in the same review. I suspect I have 20 words about Android Insurrection (really bad) so I will close now.",1359676800,,1559,4.0
