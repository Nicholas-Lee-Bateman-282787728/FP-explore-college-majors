4652444,4,B005CCLSU2,"I laughed so hard through Full Range of Motion that I was anxious to get this for my husband for Christmas. This video was not quite as good/funny.  There were a few times I laughed, but never to the point of tears or doubling over like his other one.  The one I ordered had two DVDs.  The second moved quicker from joke to joke and had a better rhythm.  Here are the Pros that earned it four stars:  clean, my kids really liked it and laughed a lot, good variety with other comedians added, and good entertainment over other choices out there.  The cons:  the physical humor this time was more strange facial expressions, and almost didn't have a lot to do with the scenes.  He would randomly throw in his funny walk, or facial expressions while getting ready for his next line, but some of the time they weren't part of the joke so they seemed misplaced.  I'm not a huge fan of the physical humor so I was hoping for less of this, rather than more of it.  I also didn't find the jokes quite as funny as Full Range of Motion, but still good clean fun. My kids will watch it again I'm sure and laugh just as hard, so that is worth it for me.",1325808000,12,1141,4.168949771689498
4652445,5,B005CCLSU2,"Transaction was smooth, delivered on time, No troubles. My son got to know of Tim Hawkins on u tube, after opening it on Christmas morning he really liked the 2 DVD's. Excellent.",1325462400,,178,4.59375
4652446,5,B005CCLSU2,"My Brother-in-Law brought the DVD over and the whole family, kids and all, were able to watch it.  I laughed so hard my eyes were watering.  It's the type of comedy that a family can relate to.  I highly recommend it, and am buying my own copy to share with my side.",1322956800,,266,4.076923076923077
4652447,5,B005CCLSU2,We watched this with a bunch of teenagers ... now my boys want to watch it themselves all the time! You don't have to worry about what's going to be said - this is great stuff.

4652448,5,B005CCLSU2,"I've seen Bill Cosby ""Himself"".  I've seen Eddie Murphy ""Delirious"".  This DVD beats all of them...and you can watch it with your kids.  The bad news is that my 5yr old thought it was so funny he likes to sing the ""I'm a Stalker"" song in public.  The three comedians have very different types of humor, but all of them are hilarious.",1321142400,2,333,4.32258064516129
4652449,5,B005CCLSU2,"I really liked being able to watch clips from this tour on God Tube(Tangle, but I think only 10% of this tour ended up online, there's really a lot here. I liked this video because it has just the right mix of laugh-so-hard-its-embarassing humor and quick-chuckle humor, you don't get so much thrown at you  one time that you get tired of laughing. As far as being clean it's all in what you consider clean, it is very clean morally though there is some potty humor.

If you are looking for clean comedy this is the funniest I've seen for a long time. It's right up there with Mark Lowry. These guys are like a christian Robbin Willaims or Steve Martin. Our family quotes them all the time.",1318809600,9,690,4.3828125

4652474,5,B005CCLSU2,"If you do, something is sure go up your nose! I didn't know a turkey sandwich chunk (meat to bread) could fit in a nasal cavity...
Tim Hawkins, as always, was hilarious. John Branyan and Bob Smiley: so glad this show introduced our family to them! I am going to look around for their stuff.
Alone, they are like individual bouts of...laughing...heck, I don't know: a sunrise on a...flock of sheep...(ah, analogies:) I don't know how to make laughing cramps read well on flat type;))
Together, be prepared to fall on the floor.

Tim Hawkins is genuinely funny - even for different tastes in humor.  My husband, my parents, and I have pretty different opinions about what is funny, but we ALL were laughing so hard we were crying during this dvd.
I love how it is clean.  I have no problems letting my three and five-year-olds watch it too.  My preteen brothers also enjoy it.  Basically Tim Hawkins is hilariously funny for the whole family.  Bob Smiley and John Branyan join him on this dvd.  John Branyan is hysterical and talented while Bob Smiley is more average in my opinion.
GREAT dvd overall.  You will not be disappointed.  I especially recommend for Father's Day :)",1337817600,,802,4.401360544217687

Only part that wasn't very funny was a section of ""fake vomit"" sounds which the comedians thought was hilarious.  Not really.  Fortunately it doesn't last long.",1332115200,,316,4.396551724137931

Tim does a great job in showing the humor in everyday life of family and relationships through observation and pure physical comedy genius.  This dvd mixes cuts from his friends Bob and John.  They aren't at Tim's level yet, but they have enough material to carry their supporting role.",1329868800,,472,4.465116279069767

8465104,5,B005CCLSU2,"Tim Hawkins is ALWAYS funny, bringing something new to make you laugh with every DVD. John Branyan is a good equivalent, although not as good as Tim. Bob Smiley can be funny sometimes, just laughs at his own jokes too much. But my opinion of Bob should NOT keep you from buying this DVD! PERFECT if you have a Tim Hawkins collection (such as myself) started, and even MORE PERFECT if you just want something to make you laugh. I would pay up to $25 for this DVD",1460419200,,461,4.25
