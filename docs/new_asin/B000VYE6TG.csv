8220532,3,B000VYE6TG,"This DVD sets you up with the basics, talks about strokes and techniques that are essential to learn.
The videos are old so its pretty entertaining to see some of the older equipment, its also pretty impressive to see the skill level of the paddlers in the video with less less forgiving boats.
Worth adding to any WW paddlers library.",1242259200,,335,4.6
