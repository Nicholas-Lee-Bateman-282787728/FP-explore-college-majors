6290841,5,B00ISS5F6A,"What a bargain!!  Two comedies that defined the 80's genre with one 'should have been nominated for an Oscar' performance by John Candy, undoubtedly the best of his too short career, and one with Chevy Chase being contained and directed by Harold Ramis to a peerless comedic performance himself.

First up John Hughes' Planes, Trains And Automobiles the ultimate trip home holiday movie that features Steve Martin trying to get home from New York to Chicago for a Thanksgiving dinner while encountering Del Griffith (John Candy) who becomes an unwanted albatross about his neck as things go from bad to worse to unbelievably rotten on the road trip from hell.  A simple premise of diminishing returns based on Murphy's Law which in any other director's hands would have been trite and dull as dirt, but with a script that sparkles and the unerring direction of Hughes our two protagonists take us on an eye opening examination of ourselves that still finds hilarity at every turn.  This is the performance of a lifetime for John Candy and in anyone else's hands Del Griffith would have been just too darn annoying to keep an audience from hating him quickly, but with that big open face and deft reactions that run the gamut, he keeps the humanity of Del right on his sleeve for us all to see and appreciate even if an increasingly impatient and frustrated Martin doesn't.  There is an unforeseen twist at the end that you won't see coming and brings a fitting end to this paean to modern life.  Just goes to prove that when we lost Hughes we lost one of the giants of movie making who saw we fellow humans as we are and was able to transfer that insight into remarkable comedies that will stand the test of time.  This movie alone is worth the price of the collection.  Trust Me.

But!  There's more gold in them thar hills!!

Next up and preceeding Planes & Trains by four years was the surprise hit of 1983 National Lampoon's Vacation starring Chevy Chase and directed by Harold Ramis.  National Lampoon has certainly had it's checkered history but starting with Animal House in 1978 and picking back up the torch here in 1983 with Vacation they have given us some of the funniest films around.  With the perfect supporting cast including the two kids (Anthony Michael Hall for one) and comedy legend Imogene Coca as the grandmother, not to mention Randy Quaid before he went all X-Files on us, you'll have a grand old time getting to Walley World (no not Walmart).  The Griswald's vacation sucks you in like a tornado and deposits you atop a heap of laughs.  I still remember Christie Brinkley in this and you won't soon forget her either.  Easily worth the price of the collection too!!!

But let's not stop there!

How about a sequel that generates about 85% of the fun of the original.  Falling 15% short makes it good on its own merits and National Lampoon's European Vacation featuring the Griswald clan in Europe is almost as funny as the original with the cast back for more mayhem.  The price of the collection is about the most I'd pay for this one in Blu-Ray alone and I'd still be checking the bargain bin to see if I could save a couple of extra bucks, but I wouldn't throw it away!

To sum up here.  Three funny films with two of them making the purchase price a real bargain.  You can't go wrong.  Planes & Trains has a 5.1 sound track...the other two are mono but pure on Blu-ray...the picture quality is well worth the upgrade to Blu as well.  So grab yourself some fun here at an outrageously low price!!",1404086400,4,3525,4.57484076433121
6290842,5,B00ISS5F6A,"Two of my favorite films... and I
DO
live in Europe, so, I'll suffer through the third.

Oh! Speaking of EUROPE, my wife was VERY pleased to find that there is a
GERMAN
sound-track for both ""NAT'L LAMPOON'S VACATION"" and, "" ' EUROPEAN VACATION.

Speaking of soundtracks, the first film is the only one [of the three] that
does NOT have a flat-mono soundtrack.

Worth your time, and, bucks!",1403568000,3,389,4.608695652173913

6290845,4,B00ISS5F6A,"All three of these comedy classics have always been re-watchable, but have jumped a few notches by finally being available in blu-ray.
