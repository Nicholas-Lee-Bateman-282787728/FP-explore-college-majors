This show's an odd one to describe. The voice acting's fantastic, and the script's solid for kid's show fair. The animation is just TERRIBLE. These three episodes, ""Everybody Loves Angie"" specifically, are the best that they get. Still, if you grew up watching it and enjoy it for the nostalgia, it's a must-buy. It's nearly impossible to find them through any other means.

For those trying to track down a specific episode, here's the rundown:

1st: Damage's Little Girl. Lady martian arrives who is evil. The lady human is suspicious of her and is right.

2nd.: Playback/Payback. The pilot episode. The three main humans, Mike, Cedric, and Angela are just trying to watch TV at Mike's house when the three main Martians, B-Bop, 2-T, and Doo-wah, intrude and summon an alien threat with Mike's satellite dish.

3rd: Everybody Loves Angie. Alien-of-the-week Chitzok finds Angela attractive and kidnaps her. The Martians and their sometimes-competent foe Stoat Muldoon, Alien Hunter work together to rescue her.",1380672000,2,1123,5.114754098360656
7963118,5,B000067IZ1,"Don't ask me why, but I always loved this series and was kind of bummed when it was dropped.  I think it was because of the passing of Robert Stack who very artfully voiced Stoat Muldoon, the exceedingly inept and egotistical ""alien hunter.""  Butt Ugly Martians was one of the early attempts at CGA, and as far as I'm concerned was pretty darn good, all things considered.  I love the interplay between Damage and Emperor Bog, neither one of who trusts the other and who are both a couple of bloated egos.  These shows were just pure, unadulterated fun, and I STILL love them.",1348963200,,576,4.509615384615385
