7453954,5,B015XC8EWU,"I have been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD. It has held up amazing well, although it is not quite as I remembered it. Plummer & Ives are great. It had lovely photography for its time & one of the most unusual plots I have ever seen in a film. It's a classic. The author MacKinley Kantor, who wrote Civil War stuff, has a bit part, which is unusual. I was thrilled finally to acquire this. Everyone who believes in conservation should see this; it's timelier now in that sense than it was when it came out. Plummer has one really great line but I won't spoil it by telling you here; get the film.",1447459200,4,610,4.1344537815126055
7453955,5,B015XC8EWU,"This review is intended for those who live in Europe since for some strange reason ""Wind Across The Everglades"" is not available here in the U.S. It is a well told and gripping story about a conservationist who is sent down to the Florida Everglades to stop the illegal poaching of wild birds for their feathers. The story takes place around the turn of the last century ad most of Florida and all of the Everglades was still wilderness. This will not be an easy assignment, especially after the Conservationist meets up with the ring leader of the bird poachers. Christopher Plummer plays the conservationist in one of his very best acting rolls ranking right there with that movie where he plays that Von Trapp fellow. Burl Ives steals the show with his performance as ""Cotton-Mouth"" the leader of the renegade poachers. It is his work in this film that makes this movie so memorable to me. It rates right up there with his roll as ""Big Daddy"" in ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"".  Well written, well made, well acted, well directed this is highly recommended by me to add to your video collection.

Now if only someone here would listen to our pleas in the U.S. to put this out on region 1 DVD so we can enjoy this wonderful movie here in the states. I promise you there would be a lot of us who would go out and purchase a copy of this movie if you release it on DVD.",1426809600,,1362,4.358267716535433
7453956,5,B015XC8EWU,"While I purchased this same movie through Warner brothers before it was made available at Amazon.com I am very pleased to see it here now!!!  This film is a important film showing the beginning of the Audubon society as well as being a great period piece. A real slice of americana portraying the sub tropical U.S. as wild & as dangerous as any film set in Africa or The amazon or any other jungle film. The characters are very colorful. Chistopher Plummer portrays a hard drinking cigar smoking passionate conservationalist named Murdock up against ""Cotton Mouth"" played to perfection by Burl Ives. Cotton mouth the king of the Glades and leader of a band of rag-tag poachers & fugetives, Primatives living off the land.  A odd relationship forms between the tenacious conservationist & the lusty life loving red bearded giant that runs around with ""Curly Cue""a poisonous water moccosin he proffesses as being his best friend and the most trust worthy of his companions.  I can't really call it a friendship between Murdock & Cotton Mouth but both men have a respectful understanding that verges on friendship.  A host of colorful characters including ""Billy one arm"" a seminole Indian outcast from his tribe & ultimatley outcast from the group of poachers with a sentance worse than hanging being tied to a manchineel tree a sub tropical tree that produces poisonous yellow apple like fruit and a acid like sap the ""professor"" states ""Its the only tree that can carve its inetials in you"". Along with its host of colorful characters there are beautiful nature scenes showing Gators, Saw fish, panthers , bears,Snakes and alot of beautiful birds. The movie is well written and so fast paced that you can watch this movie over and over again and catch something new every time. I noticed a very young Peter Faulk as one of the group of poachers. A friend of mine gave me a copy of this movie on v.h.s. and it obviously has not lost any of its impact as my Grandchildren could not be pulled away from the TV.They copmpletely freaked out over the Manchineel tree and I had to pull out websters to prove that it really exsited. The kids refused to believe Cotton Mouth died they told me he's just faking so he can get away from Murdock! I told them your probabley right to avoid any unessacary disappiontment the'll get the poetic justice of it when there older. So Enjoy watching Murdock survive the poachers and the Glades,And the poachers survive the glades and each other and all of them survive a hurricane and Murdock still has time to get the girl. ""Oh the sweet tasteing joys of this life""!! Quote by Cotton Mouth.",1355529600,7,2619,4.711790393013101
7453957,5,B015XC8EWU,"So when will this terrific film be available in the original English? I remember seeing it in the original release, and loving it. It's (as I recall) about an idealistic young naturalist (Christopher Plummer) who goes deep into the Florida Everglades to try to put a stop to a band of wild outlaws who are killing off the beautiful local bird life in order to sell their plumage for the fashionable ladies' hats of the period (turn of the century).  When he actually meets up with the outlaws (led by the roisterous Burl Ives), however, he finds himself rather charmed by their lawless, lusty lifestyle (so different from his own prim-and-proper upbringing). It's the odd friendship that springs up between these two fascinating antagonists that makes the film special. Can't wait to see it again (but in English!)",1318550400,13,814,4.898550724637682
