8109134,5,B000EGDMOG,"The Special Features on the DVD contains two things, the Trailer for the movie and a six minute segment by Ivan Fila, the writer and director of the movie. In Ivan's segment, in addition to discussing a few aspect of making the film, he discusses his research for this movie. In Milan, Italy in 1992 he met street kids stealing from tourists, from there he met with the police and finally he went to the camps (which he describes as actual prisons) and talked to the children there. He describes the movie as being ""actually based on many true stories but its fiction"". I should note here that even though Ivan's research was done in Italy the main child trafficking and exploitation in the movie is set in Germany.

Two other note worthy things before I get into my synopsis: Iakov Kultiasov as Barbu did a great job of acting as well as performing his circus stunts. Also the movie does contain a small amount of nudity, inside the strip club women seen topless a couple of times.

Synopsis, minor spoilers but probably nothing you did not figure out from the trailer:

Two Ukrainian children, Barbu (age ten) and Mimma (age 13), are not actually brother and sister but were raised as such and love each as brother and sister. They are both very talented and put on their own circus act in their small village. When Caruso, a circus owner, comes to town Barbu sets out to convince Caruso to take Barbu and Mimma with him to join his circus. He does have a reputation for taking children and training them as circus performers. He also pays the parents of the children well when he takes them.

But all is not as it seems. First of all he is smuggling the children out of the country, which is a hint right to start with that something is wrong. Only Barbu manages to elude the border guards and meet up with Caruso in Slovakia. This impresses Caruso and he is the only child in the group which Caruso actually takes to the circus in Germany. It quickly becomes evident to the movie audience that the circus is not functional. Caruso is actually running a training camp for underage thieves who support him.

Now if this makes you think of Fagin from ""Oliver Twist,"" there is not really much of a comparison. Even the worst Fagin I have seen in an Oliver Twist movie would be a good guy compared to Caruso. Most of the children Caruso smuggles into Germany he re-sales. And Barbu is not Oliver, he has no moral dilemma about stealing. He is housed by an Albanian boy named Marcel who teaches him the ropes of his new live as a thief. Sticking with the ""Oliver Twist"" comparison, Marcel would make a good Artful Dodger.

Barbu is a fast learner when it comes to being a thief, but with his language barrier (speaking Russian while everybody else is speaking German) and his idealization of Caruso he is very slow to pickup on the truth to the overall situation. Caruso tells Barbu a series of lies about where Mimma is, and Barbu accepts them all until very close to the end of the movie.

I will not give away the end of the movie, but I will say that Caruso severally under estimated how much Barbu loved Mimma, and what he would do to save her. He also misjudged a second person.",1413072000,,3182,4.447684391080617

8109142,5,B000EGDMOG,"'Koenig der Diebe' ('King of Thieves') is a powerful indictment dealing with child slavery in the German marketplace.  The subject is a tough one to watch but the writing, direction, acting, scenic design, and production of this brilliant film is so incredibly fine that is commands attention.

The story is a contemporary one, opening in The Ukraine where 10-year old Barbu (Iakov Kultiasov) and his 13-year old sister Mimma (Julia Khanverdieva) are staging a simple but really fine circus in the dusty little town center.  Obviously living in fantasy of circus life, they greet the scrubby but congenial Caruso (Lazar Ristovski) as he rides into town tossing candy to the kids.  Caruso is an ex-circus owner who is now in the trade of child trafficking and when he sees the buoyant and irresistible Barbu he decides to 'buy' him from the father.  Barbu is thrilled but insists Mimma go with him to 'join the big circus' in Berlin: the father consents (accepting money for the purchase of his children) and the three drive off to their new destinies. Barbu and Caruso bond despite the language barrier - Caruso speaks German, Barbu speaks Russian, but they manage to communicate on certain levels. At the Ukrainian/Slovakian border Caruso is stopped and the children he has gathered disperse (Caruso promises to meet Barbu in Berlin and bring Mimma with him).  Barbu sets out across country and eventually arrives in Berlin, full of hopes and fantasies ('I am Barbu, King of the Circus'), only to discover through his new found friend, Albanian boy Marcel (Oktay Ozdemir), that the 'circus' Caruso runs has no audience, but instead is a 'school' for teaching children how to steal to support him.

Caruso lives in a circus tent with a shaved-headed woman Julie (Katharina Thalbach) who is addicted to drugs administered by Caruso to relieve her constant pain (we learn that her pain comes from a trapeze act accident when Caruso failed to catch her resulting in a traumatic fall).  Also in the 'circus' are two thugs who police the activities of the boys' thefts.  The ever-optimistic Barbu still imagines he will be the king of the circus but is appalled as he gradually discovers the realities of the life of thievery, crime, and most of all that Mimma has been sold into prostitution to a loathsome cruel pimp Kardinal (Paulus Manker). This discovery pushes Barbu to acts of theft to gain money to buy back his sister, but the obstacles he meets along the way emphasize the incredible brutality and cruelty of Caruso and his cohorts.  The manner in which the film ends is best left to the viewer to discover, but it is one that will make an indelible imprint on the psyche and heart of those fortunate enough to see this work of art.

Ivan Fila, born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, is a gifted writer and director.  Despite the heart wrenching story matter, he allows us to see all sides of the child trafficking business - including the bonding among the children and the transient feelings of power and success as they learn 'new trade'.  The actors in this drama are absolutely extraordinary: few child actors can match the performance of Iakov Kultiasov as Barbu, and this is his first experience at acting!  The set decoration, lighting, costumes, scenery, cinematography, and musical score by Michael Kocab  are as atmospheric as anything ever filmed!  KING OF THIEVES  is an amazingly fine film, but audiences should be warned that it has moments of violence that are difficult to watch.  Highly Recommended.
