1707909,5,B000065U2V,"I highly recommend this movie to all who are favorably interested in Good Selkie/Mermaid movies.  The plot is very well done following the myths and legends well. The setting in Ireland is also excellent.  During the movie the Selkie speaks alittle about her world/home, and she uses her magic to help two humans in need.  The movie also involves a love story.",1203033600,2,360,4.774193548387097
1707910,4,B000065U2V,"First I would like to say that this made for TV Hallmark movie has a production value that is good enough for the big screen. Scott Glenn gives a fine performance of a fisherman pinning away for his dead wife. He feels his heart and soul is gone and he will never love again. Saffron Burrows plays a Seltie who is trapped on land in her human form, she has no understanding of love. But they are the ill-fated catalyst that each other need to learn that the soul does not die. And the heart has an infinite capacity for love.

The movie also shows a stark contrast between good and evil, not subtly in this movie. It is an old romance movie that would have found its heyday a couple of generations ago. I was pleasantly surprised it was made today. This movie is worth watching with your loved one. I am sure your library will have a copy of this movie.",1184025600,11,853,4.233128834355829
1707911,2,B000065U2V,Could not get into this movie.  It was too bizare.  I didn't even finish watching it.  A dark movie...,1162684800,2,102,4.2631578947368425
1707912,5,B000065U2V,"An excellent-if somewhat strange-movie. Scott Glenn does an excellent job, as does Saffron Burrows. She manages a wild sort of beauty in this quite fitting for the plot.",1154736000,3,169,5.071428571428571
1707913,5,B000065U2V,A wonderful movie about love that doesn't die because of separation. A must watch for all Irish.,1150848000,4,96,4.705882352941177
1707914,3,B000065U2V,"Good, good movie. A dour, silent fisherman still mourning his wife falls in love with a selkie, a woman from the sea, almost on first sight, and gradually their love grows until they will give up anything for each other. But will it be enough to keep them together against all odds? This is not a fabulous or even a superb movie. But it is an unusual and moving romance, carried along particularly by its stunning cinematography and Saffron Burrows' performance as the wild but gentle selkie. Scott Glenn gives a good solid performance as always, and a haunting music score carries it along. I gave it less than four stars because a lot of Scott's lines and dialogue were pretty bad, and it was a little slow-paced. But for anyone who enjoys Hallmark, is a sucker for romance, or just wants something a little different, this is the movie for you.",1149984000,12,847,4.578947368421052
1707915,5,B000065U2V,"An ill-fated love story set against the backdrop of a rustic Irish fishing village. Owen Quinn (Scott Glenn), widower and fisherman has been living a solitary life since his wifes' death five years ago. That all changes when an enchanting and mysterious woman with no name (Saffron Burrows) arrives in the village. She reaches out to him for help and he responds by taking her into his home. She takes the name Mairead and before long her kind and gentle ways heal his loneliness and pain.

However their love is not to be, for she is not what she appears to be. She is a seltie, one of the mythical seal people mentioned in Irish legend and lore. Her human form is only temporary, soon she must return to the sea or perish on the shore.

This may be a Hallmark Hall of Fame feature made for television, but you wouldn't know it from the production values. This is a wonderfully done film, one of those old-fashioned romantic tearjerkers that will stay with you for a long time. It also contains some of the most breathtaking scenic shots of the Irish coastline you'll ever see.

Scott Glenn delivers a strong performance as always, while Saffron Burrows plays the part of the mythical woman/seal to absolute perfection. This is a film that can be watched over and over again without ever losing its emotional impact.",1117152000,67,1317,4.619658119658119
1707916,5,B000065U2V,"This movie is based upon high ideals and values.  It demonstrates the struggle between light and dark forces.  It shows true spirit, wisedom, strength and beauty for what they are.  I reccomend this movie highly.  I am surprised it was made in this day in age.",1031443200,26,260,4.586956521739131
1707917,5,B000065U2V,This is a great story based on the Irish legend of the selties and their human counter-parts. It tells the story of two people from two different world find a unque bond in each other. The actors carry the story beatifuly right to the end. This is a great movie for anyone who loves a good romantic story.,1018051200,30,305,4.275862068965517
1707968,5,B000065U2V,"When we watch a human and a selkie together, we rediscover what it is like to be human.  It moves us to think about knowing, remembering, feeling, love, loss, and the meaning of ""soul.""  It touches strong emotional currents.  These things are not worked out in consistent detail, but ""The Seventh Stream"" is a great movie for those who enjoy myth and fantasy.  It has a sound ethical dimension, and the climax is a moment of pure mythmaking.

One reason it works so well may be that it uses pieces of pieces from stories we can't quite forget.  I don't suppose that the writer/director had the gospel parallels in mind, but I sure do like the movie!

My wife calls it ""very beautiful"" and -- but that would be giving the story away!",1413158400,3,732,4.458646616541353

1707970,4,B000065U2V,"It is a good movie if you like mystical Irish legends and great scenery.  The accents are a little tough and the plot is pretty predictable, however the cast is excellent and I had to grab a hankie at the conclusion.",1406246400,2,216,4.2682926829268295
1707971,5,B000065U2V,"This is definitely a movie that reminds me of the line from ""The Devil's Own,"" where the Brad Pitt character says that its not an American story, but an Irish story.  This is most definitely an Irish story of romance and one that is very much tied to the beauty and the sorrows of the sea.  Its set in the past, in a small fishing village where the luck has run out and the fish have all but disappeared, so everyone is hungry and desperate.  One desperate man is breaking the law by going out killing seals and, in so doing, finds a pelt that has been set aside by one of the selkie, the fairy seal-people who can take on human form by going on land and taking off their sealskins.  He has control over her then by keeping her skin and she brings him loads of fish and so prosperity.

However, the romance is between this seal-woman trapped on land and Owen Quinn, a fisherman trapped in the lingering grief of his wife lost at sea 5 years ago and who has closed off his heart ever since.  He has found his solace in books, including Celtic fairytales, while withdrawing from those around him.  He has lost knowledge of his soul in a way.  While the Selkie are said not to have souls.  He and the seal-woman are drawn together, each in their own sadness and longing, and learn in each other what love is and so find their souls together.

This is a slow-paced movie, but one that comes to haunt your own heart.  The crash of the waves, the sorrowing cry of the seals for one of their own, the seal-woman--whom Owen names ""Mairead,"" meaning Pearl, which reminds one of both of the almost transluscent beauty of this woman and of how pearls can be seen as the tears of the ocean--and how she learns about joy and memory, plus the dangers of growing to love something as primal and powerful as the sea, something you can never own...this movie has a flavor all its own.

Be warned--if you are looking for a happy happy ending, you will not find it here.  But you will find a heartwarming story with a special magic all its own.  Besides ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" this is the best movie about the Selkie I've ever seen.",1399248000,2,2118,4.302267002518891

1707973,5,B000065U2V,"Such a simple, yet heart-rending tale!  No explosions or car-chases, but a tale of magic, envy, and the depths to which greed can drive people, and the love from the depths of the heart that can SAVE people as well.  A CLASSIC Hallmark film!",1384819200,,241,4.454545454545454
1707974,4,B000065U2V,"If you are looking for another Hollywood action film with a fast-paced plot, wild characters and a big bang at the end, this isn't that movie.  If you want something different, a little slower paced with a thoughtful plot, a wee bit of mystery and a beautiful seaside setting, this may be for you.  I found it interesting that the majority of the cast consisted of the residents of this fishing village by the sea.  It's a tale of lost love, redemption and belief in a legend that ultimately leads to belief in the human heart and spirit.",1364428800,2,538,4.469387755102041
1707975,4,B000065U2V,"If you loved The Secret of Roan Inish you'll like this movie.  If you liked this movie you'll love The Secret of Roan Inish.  They both deal with the Irish legend of the selkie, a seal that takes human form.  This movie is generally well acted with a good story.  The selkie woman finds herself bound to an abusive fisherman due to his finding and hiding of her seal self's skin.  She seeks out kindly fisherman who's lost all joy in his life after the death of his wife.  I was a bit put off by the ""kindly"" fisherman's sometimes violent actions although never towards the selkie woman.  When he believes he will lose her, he trashes his own home in a fit of rage.  This just felt wrong.  Still, it's a worthwhile and well done movie with great photography and scenery.  It brings the legend to life in a sometimes mystical, sometimes blunt, always interesting story.  A nice break from the current corp of CGI, all action, no story movies.",1319932800,,941,4.444444444444445
1707976,5,B000065U2V,"If you love legends, folklore, myths, or story tellers, then this is a movie for you.  I am a huge fan of all of the above, so I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!  Would definitely buy it again.",1289952000,,182,4.027777777777778
1707977,5,B000065U2V,"I had recently watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ondine/dp/B003LL3FIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ondine</a>&nbsp;which alluded to the selkie myth, and I was reminded of this older drama by Hallmark which draws heavily upon the selkie mythology and does so in a compelling and credible manner. Set in a sleepy Irish coastal village in the early 1900s, Scott Glenn plays Owen Quinn, a lonely and sad widower who pines for his late wife who was his soulmate. Quinn and his best friend Willy (Eamon Morrissey) are both fishermen who have fallen on hard times due to the lack of fishing prospects. In fact, the entire village is experiencing hard financial times, and so it comes as a surprise when one of the least liked village inhabitants, a surly young man named Eamon Dunhill (Joseph Kelly) suddenly prospers. The circumstances are strange - Eamon begins showing up with a beautiful young woman (Saffron Burrows) who tags along with him on his fishing boat, and each time return with a boat full of fish. No one knows the identity of this mysterious young woman, and the village is astir with gossip and speculation.

Then things gets even stranger - Quinn finds the young woman spying on him at his isolated home near the sea, and begins to imagine this lady visiting him in his dreams, pleading for his help in recovering something that she has lost. Well, (no spoiler here given the plot), the woman claims to be a selkie who is bound to Eamon and the land as long as Eamon keeps her sealskin. She needs to find the sealskin and return to the sea before the next seventh stream comes to an end.

The story has all the elements that make for a riveting watch - suspense, romance, elements of the supernatural, excellent casting, beautiful cinematography of the Irish coast and romantic soundtrack, all of which further enhance the story. A wonderful yet poignant romantic drama.",1288137600,6,1929,5.062893081761007
