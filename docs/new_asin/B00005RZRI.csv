1658740,5,B00005RZRI,"I have been looking for an affordable copy since I saw this movie in the theater in the early 90's.  This is a fun movie and a very good preformance by the younger-with hair Jason Alexander.  I just love this under shown, under advertised, and under promoted movie!",1259798400,,265,4.5
1658741,4,B00005RZRI,"Nia Peeples looks great in this film. A rare movie where a beautiful woman falls in love with a chubby guy.

Name of movies and TV shows where the fat guy gets a beatiful woman.

1658742,4,B00005RZRI,"I saw this movie when originally came out in 1992, and thought it was wonderfully done. It takes the story of someone who knows abject lonliness and how he uses food for a comfort, and how someone, a certain someone, can make a difference and help them see the change that they need to do, to be a better them. Not a big Seinfeld fan, but thought the Jason Alexander showed he was the cream of that crop in this performance.",1209340800,5,424,4.246913580246914

Never again will I buy from your 3rd party companies.  I was ripped off on this one. This CD was represnted as new in box....

box was opend with no seals, this must have benn used a million times or a copy of some sort.....

The CD was to be a new in package, It was opened with loose cellifane wraped around it, the quality is worst then a old VHS tape. Not Very Happy customer.  Joe Albano",1127001600,2,520,3.9902912621359223

1658773,2,B00005RZRI,"Silly, predictable and mediocre. Typical of the character he played on Seinfeld. If that thrilled you, this may as well. I didn't finish watching it. Bored before it got all through. A typical TV (free) program/movie. If I have seen this show once, I've seen it countless other times. Not entertaining.",1465776000,,302,4.9411764705882355

It erroneously informed us that there was insufficient bandwidth to both our TiVo box and then to our Fire Stick to complete.  BOOO!  We have 130 Mbps downlink service from Comcast, and Netflix was working fine.  We gave up about halfway through this flic and switched to a movie on Netflix--it played just fine.

1658816,4,B00005RZRI,"Sweet and relatable.  At this point in his life, Jason Alexander reminded me a bit of Gene Kelly in looks.  I very much enjoyed the story and could relate to his character.  It was a more gentle and subtle touch of the movie ""Marty"".",1433721600,,233,4.25

1658819,1,B00005RZRI,"This movie is not only full of insults and bigotry against people who aren't thin, it perpetuates the lose-weight-through-exercise myth that was hatched in the 80s, but which has now been disproven. The Nia Peeples character is constantly judging the Jason Alexander character's weight and evaluating what he's putting in his mouth. No one should date someone who's commenting on their dinner plate like that! It's a rude movie with a weak plot and slow pacing. Peeples is a grad student using Alexander as her subject for a paper on the behavior of obese people (without him knowing) UGH! Herbalife's sponsorship of this film isn't subtle.",1433116800,2,640,5.047169811320755

1658821,3,B00005RZRI,"Although Jason Alexander and a few of the old timers do well with their acting, Peeples cannot act her way out of a paper bag...and her singing Is atrocious!

Alexander has always been a terrific actor to me. He plays the part of a regular Joe who is overlooked by a pretty girl who's too superficial to see him for who he really is Later, she gets a clue. Unfortunately, he accepts her after his ill treatment.

If you're not too picky about acting and the message of the movie, you may enjoy it.",1432080000,,497,4.276595744680851

1658831,5,B00005RZRI,I rented this quiet little gem twenty years ago and was enthralled by it. Jason Alexander is perfect as the over weight schlub Bernie but its Nia Peeples that makes this gem shine. I think that this movie went un noticed by the public at large and thats a shame because this definitely is a date night movie. I finally have this movie in my library.,1426032000,,349,4.303030303030303

1658842,1,B00005RZRI,"I was able to suffer through only about 30 to 40 minutes of this dud.  The main character is not a desirable character - a sissified fat momma's boy who's in his 30s and still living with his parents.  I could not find the kind of sympathy for the character that is required in order to enjoy any of his tribulations.  Then, introduce a dazzling woman who is smart, outgoing, and on-the-ball and pretend that she will develop a romantic interest in such a loser.  Yeah right.  Girls who yearn for any sort of sappy romance movie will tolerate this much better than I could.  If you're a guy who wants anything believable and interesting for normal folk, I don't think you'll be pleased.",1421452800,,686,4.491935483870968

1658856,4,B00005RZRI,This movie was pleasantly surprising.  The lady on the cover threw me off as she isn't the main character.  The writing goes way beyond romance but also self reflection and renewed hope.  Not as well written as movies such as You've Got Mail but excellent story.,1417564800,,262,4.6521739130434785

1658875,5,B00005RZRI,"This movie was a wonderful surprise.  I had never seen it before and enjoyed it very much.  One could not guess how it would end until the last 3 minutes of the film. The title and photo on the cover of the movie doesn't give a hint to the treasure that is in this film. I am not one who really ""enjoys"" romance films and I would not really put it in that category.  It was about life and the miscommunications that can evolve when dealing with people. The movie does not fall into the category of a musical but I enjoyed the singing done by the character Tress.
All of the characters were well developed and the differences between the two different ethnic backgrounds were well done.
My only disappointment is that the DVD is no longer available through Amazon.  This was one of those movies I would have loved to add to my collection.",1414540800,,837,4.346153846153846

1658889,5,B00005RZRI,"I didn't know they made movies like this anymore! I must say this film reminded me of a much older film starring Dom Deluise -- Fatso. What happens when a lonely man who buries his sadness and isolation in food finally finds the love of his life? This is a delightful exploration of human relationships when someone who always played one, reliable and dependable role branches out to become the person he has always wanted to be.

I Don't Buy Kisses Anymore starts out slowly, but blossoms into much more than I ever expected. Highly recommended!",1412208000,6,546,4.6875

1658892,5,B00005RZRI,I love everything about this movie!  I was very excited that Amazon prime had it. The quality and sound were great for being an older movie. Many people can relate to Bernie and his struggles with weight and self esteem issues.,1375660800,,227,4.536585365853658
1658893,5,B00005RZRI,I received it in excellent condition (a first from when I had ordered before from another company)! I love this movie with great acting from both main stars in their early careers.,1363737600,,180,4.65625

1658895,5,B00005RZRI,"I love to curl up on the couch with my husband on a rainy evening and enjoy this cute flick, and some chocolate, of course.  Unlike in almost every other performance, Jason Alexander is likeable and adorable.  You actually hope he gets the girl, rather than hoping he'd get hit by a bus.",1309996800,2,287,4.39622641509434
1658896,5,B00005RZRI,Jason Alexander is so sweet as Bernie. The character actors are wonderfully cast and the plot is amusing. It's Jason at his best. Do not judge the movie by the star rating because several people gave it one star. I guess they were unhappy with the company where they bought their copy. Buy it directly from Amazon or buy it used on Half.com but give it a chance. This is a great little movie and Jason is amazing in it. It's one of my favorites. Bernie is a wonderful guy. You won't easily forget him or Jason's performance.,1309132800,6,524,4.357142857142857
1658897,1,B00005RZRI,"I love the film ""I Don't Buy Kisses Anymore"" starring Nia Peeples and Jason Alexander, the film itself I give 4 stars and the good reviews on here are for the vhs not the DVD, but the company that released it gets a big fat 0,TOP TEN is one of the worst company's ever,if you order ..be WARNED ask buyer is it from Top Ten Media. When I got in mail, it was sealed but you could tell it was cheaply done from artwork put on regular paper to the DvD which is even worse. The company just duplicated a cheap vhs onto Dvd, and it looks like they even pressed it that way! The film messes up couple times, which looked like the Vhs was eaten up and still they put it on DvD!Also, the picture looks like you put an old Vhs in your dvd player. I hope there is a better company that puts this on DvD, if so..let me and other people know. Be WARNED STAY AWAY FROM TOP TEN NEW MEDIA!",1278115200,3,873,3.965909090909091
1658898,5,B00005RZRI,"My mom wanted this movie, but I couldn't find it in any store. So, I went to trusty Amazon and found it. She has loved this movie for years, and we used to have it on VHS, and after explaining to her what a DVD was, I ordered it for her. We gave her a portable DVD player (which she also didn't understand well) and she played it over and over. She's sick and bed-bound, so I was glad she could watch a movie she enjoyed so much.",1271462400,5,429,3.8863636363636362

The DVD was not a DVD-R, but originally pressed. But the cover and movie quality wasn't exactly Grade A quality. Watchable, however.",1523491200,,151,4.8076923076923075
7953293,1,B00005RZRI,"I recently went through a company called "" Liquid Music"" out of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to buy the movie ""I don't buy kisses anymore"". This movie was suppose to be new and I could not believe how bad this movie was. When it came it looked new with the cellophane wrapper on it and everything but when you played the movie it stalled about every two to three minutes and I'm not exaggerating at all. I tried to return  it and followed all there instructions on how to do it and never heard back from them. I lost $32.00 and I'm hoping by writing this review no one else gets cheated like I did.
Thanks for listening

7953295,3,B00005RZRI,A Decent story; with matching performances. Jason Alexander was convincing as a fat man.,1502323200,,88,5.357142857142857
7953296,3,B00005RZRI,"I paid only $6. for this DVD so I guess I shouldn't have expected much. It was used and stopped playing at several points due to DVD damage.
Also the sound quality was poor but no option for subtitles. The movie was not a disappointment in itself but I couldn't make out everything said.
Thank you",1501632000,,297,4.321428571428571

7953298,3,B00005RZRI,This is a pretty good romantic movie.  Jason Alexander plays a lonely over weight man who goes to the candy store everyday to cope with his problems.  He meets a graduate student who decides to make him the subject of her research paper about over weight men.  He falls in love with her.  Then when he finds out she has just been doing research on him breaks up.  Nia Peeples is also very good.  And pretty good to look at.  She reminds me of Valarie Bertinelli.,1494806400,,462,4.3023255813953485
