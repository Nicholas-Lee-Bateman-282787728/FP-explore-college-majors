culture and this is a wonderful way to capture that and preserve it.",1362268800,,189,4.428571428571429
7972121,5,B00006LPDM,"This movie is off the hook!  It is amazing in every aspect.  The riders are awsome and some of the jumps and drops are unbeleivable.  The music is also very good and fits in extremely well.  This movie is all freeriding, downhill racing, and dirt jumping but is also has Jeff Lenosky doing some crazy street riding.  It is a definite buy.  Good Luck Riding.",1055894400,,357,4.415384615384616
