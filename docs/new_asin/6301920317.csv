7816583,5,6301920317,Without a doubt this was Jerrys best live performance on tape during the 1980s. I have long been a Jerry Lee fan since 1957  and have saw  about 30 times during the 1960s -2000s (his best period  was 1964-1972) but there was not any video of his concerts back then-except on LP records. and thats too  Bad-anyway this is a must for any Jerry Lee fan.,1315612800,,350,4.257575757575758
7816584,5,6301920317,"I am a long time Jerry Lee Lewis fan.  Some of his live performances are good and some OK.  However, without question, this is his greatest ever, period.  His playing, voice, song selection, and the overall performance make this a must have.  Now for the rub: For some crazy reason, this never been offered in DVD or CD format.  Dumb. Buy it and have it converted to DVD and CD. The picture quality on the VHS isn't great.  The soundtrack is great.  Well worth the time and money to have it ripped.",1259971200,,498,4.3478260869565215
7816585,3,6301920317,this is the same as a rockin evening with jerry lee lewis which was the same as the country mini concert but this has all the songs but poorer picture quality.,1232496000,6,159,4.161290322580645
