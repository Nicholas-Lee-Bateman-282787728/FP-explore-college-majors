8456045,5,B00540CLDA,"This is a passionate and moving account of a lifelong friendship between a young woman and the horse who has stolen her heart.  The daughter of a poor rancher, Sieun aspires to become a jockey, as her deceased mother had been.  Her sullen, embittered father has other aspirations for her, and when he sells her prized pony to fund her college tuition, she fights for her dream.  Eventually, that dream brings her back in touch with Thunder, her beloved horse, who recognizes her too.  Together, they fashion a life in the mercurial world of horse racing, and a rare and beautiful relationship ensues that tests their mettle and brings out the best in both of them.  A must-see if you are an animal lover.  However, the DVD format doesn't work on most American DVD players.  I saw it on MNet, a Korean movie channel (it has English subtitles).  If you can get it as an instant video or you get the chance to see it in any available format, don't miss it.",1415491200,,953,4.5
