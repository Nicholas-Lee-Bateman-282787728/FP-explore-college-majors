8715815,5,B00XEGTWQU,"Be prepared to be on the edge of your seat! Excellent cast, excellent acting. I found myself thinking about this family even when not watching the dvd.  I shared with family members who are from Denmark-they enjoyed the series as well. Can't over-recommend.  Wish there was a season 3 but it's easy to figure out what it would be like. I speak a lot of Danish but the English subtitles were really helpful.",1448323200,,406,4.5479452054794525
