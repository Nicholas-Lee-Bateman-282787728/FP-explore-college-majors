1640723,5,B00005OATQ,"The release on DVD of this controversial Bayreuth production (it was heavily booed during its first run in 1976 but received an ovation lasting for over 90 minutes when it bowed out in 1980) enables one to re-evaluate it afresh, both in relation to the production and the singing.
After more than 20 years during which people have become accustomed to some very outrageous production style, Patrice Chereau's attempt seems almost traditional by comparison. (The production here was filmed in 1979 and 1980, when some of the original weaknesses in 1976, both as regards the direction and the sets, had already been ironed out.) Nevertheless, what matters most is that, for most of the time, Chereau's interpretation of the drama is not only workable, it's also coherent and, at times, illuminating. It works extremely well on screen, thanks to the video direction by Brian Large. Some may quibble about the hydro-electric dam in Rheingold, the dinner jackets in Goetterdaemmerung, the pendulum in Walkure and the steam-driven forging machine in Siegfried. Yet, all these have a point in Chereau's pro-Marxist, pro-environmentalist and rather pessimistic approach of the cycle. In fact, such up-dating make the drama even more readily understandable by most. While there are some minor failures in some of the scenes, these are far out-weighed by the many good points. This production indeed deserves its classic status.
The quality of singing (but not the acting, which is unanimously considered to be excellent) has also been criticised by some. However, I find it acceptable. There're also some fine performances. The biggest disappointment is perhaps Manfred Jung's Siegfried. But even he isn't unbearable. Jones is vocally erratic, but her dramatic involvement plus quite an amount of simply thrilling singing (as well as her pleasant appearance) more than compensates for some passing tonal unsteadiness. McIntyre's Wotan is authoritative even though the character doesn't attract one's sympathy. (His Wotan DOES carry a spear.) Many of the singers in the other characters (especially the Siegmund, Sieglinde, Fricka, Alberich, Loge, Fasolt, Fafner, Hagen) have also made their mark, and everyone works in close colloboration with each other, making this is genuine team performance.
I think this set should appeal to those who're familiar with the Ring as well as those new to Wagner. After all, when this production was serialised on TV 20 years ago, it has attracted a large number of viewers, many of whom had not even heard a note from the Ring before.",1004572800,17,2561,5.248780487804878

The first DVD release of the Bayreuth Centenary production of Wagner's Ring (or any Ring for that matter). This is a recording of Patrice Chreaus legendary production. Add Pierre Boulez to this mix and an outstanding price and this one's a no-brainer. One can only hope that many more of opera's masterworks get this kind of treatment (for the DVD format) in the near future.",1002585600,9,643,5.242718446601942
1640725,5,B00005OATQ,"I'm not a very enthusiastic opera-goer. Yet, viewing this DVD recording is a revelation for me - I never imagine that the acting in classical opera to be so 'life-like' and that the singing and staging can match the drama to form such a cohesive whole. I suppose that this is the kind of production that, despite its arousing some controversy, can keep the genre thriving in the modern age. It surely makes me reassess my own views (and perhaps prejudicies) of performances of classical opera! I'm no connoisseur of classical singing, but I found the singing here to be thrilling most of the time. It's a very enjoyable viewing/listening experience.
I'll certainly try to catch a performance of Wagner's complete Ring in the opera house when I next come across it. In the meantime, I'm sure that this excellent DVD recording will give me many hours of viewing/listening pleasure at home.",1046908800,9,887,4.842105263157895
1640726,5,B00005OATQ,"I found this DVD production of Wagner's epic Ring Cyle to be hugely enjoyable. It's in many ways a splendid production which keeps the viewer riveted to the drama. On the whole, it's exceedingly well directed, too, even though there're a few minor flaws (which is unavoidable for any production on such a scale). The acting deserves special mention because this production boasts some of the best acting that I've ever seen on the operatic stage, whether in the opera house or on video. The singing is generally very good and every one seems to have given his or her all.
I have slight reservations on Boulez's conducting, which is comparatively lightweight when compared with performances by other seasoned Wagnerian conductors. Yet, such an interpretation somehow fits in with the production concept, which is finely realised in the Bayreuth Festival Hall. It all makes an unforgettable viewing/listening experience.",1041724800,10,918,5.20945945945946
1640727,5,B00005OATQ,"I previously owned a set of this production on VHS. It is, by all counts, an extraordinary production. Even if some of the production concepts look a little gimmicky (but most of them are valid under Chereau's concept), the performace as a whole is so convincing that one can readily overlook the small defects, which are bound to occur in any staging or performance of this momumental work. I'm therefore extremely pleased that the picture and sound qualities have been significantly improved in this newest DVD incarnation. In fact, I've never found the Ring more enjoyable than when watching this marvellous production in this new medium.
The cast is pretty first rate (for these times) and the acting is superb. I do find Boulez's interpretation to be slightly less heroic than I would have liked. That said, he gives a very energetic reading of the score and propels the drama forward with considerable power.",1040256000,8,914,4.941558441558442
1640728,5,B00005OATQ,"This production may seem shocking to those who prefer traditional productions. In up-dating the action to the Industrial Revoluation, Patrice Chereau robs the cycle of its universality (even though class-struggle is perhaps still relevant to our age). Yet, I suppose that Chereau's principal aim is not to expatiate on the drama's universality, but is instead to place the drama in a specific context and see how it works within such ambits. While some people may not like it, I do consider it to be, on the whole, a very effective and powerful piece of drama (and stage direction). It truly deserves to be seen.
And heard, too. For the singing here is certainly better than most Wagnerian productions that one can see these days. My only reservation is in Manfred Jung's Siegfried, for his voice sounds a little bumpy. Yet, it's only fair to report that he survives the strenuous role. I like Gwyneth Jones' powerful Brunnhilde, Hofmann's romantic Siegmund and even McIntyre's rather unsympathetic Wotan. Most of the other roles are well taken, and all act convincingly and are loyal to the production concept, which helps a lot to make it a success.
Boulez's reading of the score is brisk and less pompous that one would have encountered elsewhere but he succeeds in pushing the drama ahead relentlessly. Contrary to common belief, he's actually quite an exciting conductor. The Bayreuth orchestra and chorus perform very well.",1039910400,10,1429,5.033755274261603
1640729,1,B00005OATQ,"Every Ring production is controversial, and this one certainly was back when it was first unveiled.  I imagine that there are a number of viewers that will be led to Wagner's Ring by way of the renewed interest in fantasy, and particularly the success of the somewhat similar ""Lord of the Rings.""  While this production certainly has its merits, I have to admit that many elements of this production irritated me, and I suspect those viewers coming to Wagner for the first time might be better directed to the Met's traditional staging (also on DVD).  The orchestra here is world class, and I would agree that as a whole the acting here is superior to the Met's, although its a toss up as to which production has the better singing.  What never worked for me is the staging, set in the ""real world"" of the Industrial Age.  For some this made the cycle more understandable, for me there was too much of a clash between the mythological actions and the real life settings... its hard to understand why industial tycoons would put their daughters into a magical sleep to be awoken by future heroes.  Couldn't they just disinheret them?  The dragon is ridiculous.  Why do prostitutes live *in* the river?  And it seems that Wotan keeps up the manipulation too long, rendering the idea of Siegfried as an ""independent"" hero moot.  Certain aspects of the production do make the viewer rethink his/her ideas about the meaning of the Ring, and it certainly qualifies as an important Wagner achievement, but I'd start my Wagner journey elsewhere.",1039132800,13,1537,4.766037735849056
1640730,5,B00005OATQ,"I had the great fortune to attend this performance each year from 1977 to 1980 at Bayreuth. I could wittness the complete and utterly transformation of the attendees from hostile outrage in 1977 (including outburst during the performance) to universal acceptance and more than 1 1/2 hour standing ovations after the final performance of Gtterdmmerung. This transformation from the most hated 'French' Ring to the production of the century comes from the achievement of staging/directing/conducting of this unique masterpiece as a truly Musikdrama, i.e. an experience wherein the music, the acting and the words are melted together into one solid piece. It is very seldom that Wagner's invention of Leitmotiv (the thought behind the action) is so clearly transformed into acting and viewing. Chereau lets the drama unfold in the Industrial Revolution, Wotan is the undisputed owner of a business empire, his counterpart Alberich represents the lower working class with high ambitions for revolution. Siegried is the nature boy who doesn't really know who he is. When stepping into the high class world of the Gibichungen in Gtterdmmerung, he fails because he cannot accomodate for all the tricks and traps of this utterly immoral and selfish society. The same happens to Siegmund when he steps into the world of the well settled and powerfull landowner Hunding.
The acting of every person in this performance is brilliant and so closely tied to the deeper meaning of the whole Ring that I doubt that there will be ever a production that can capture the real message of Wagner's Ring in such clearness - the rise and fall of the ruling class and the role of love and truthfullness in creating a new and better world. This is Wagners most political work and this DVD shows it clearly. If you have seen the Ring before in a traditional performance (like the Met-DVD) you will see a completely different Ring now.
The highly transparent conducting of Boulez in conjunction with the superb acting/singing opens complete new dimensions in understanding and feeling of the Ring.
The video quality might not be the best (it is still very good) and some of the singers might not be prime (such as Gunther and Sieglinde), but - again - this recording is not an opera, it is a Musikdrama!
If you want to enjoy the Ring as a ""Gesamtkunstwerk"", as a perfect combination of words, music, stage setting and acting - this one is a must for you.",1037059200,20,2427,4.921951219512195
1640731,5,B00005OATQ,"This wonderful production makes magnificent home-viewing. Brian Large video direction is excellent, and although both the sound and the picture reveals the original video's age, both have been enhanced in this new DVD format.
It's difficult to describe in a few words the production style of such a mammoth opera cycle. While Chereau's direction has been considered iconoclastic in the seventies, it now seems to be (mostly) intelligent and dramatically appropriate. The same can be said for the sets and costumes. In fact, this production has already become a sort of classic in opera production, and it's therefore wonderful to have it on DVD.
The standard of acting at Bayreuth is always high. But it reached lofty heights for this centenial production. No one disappoints and their acting skills often rival those who ply their trade in theatres. As regards the singing, while it may not rival the best in history, with hindsight, it's much better that what we're treated to these days. And there're some transcendent performances, too.
While playing a video of an opera performance at home cannot be compared with experiencing the work live in the opera house, such is the powerful of this production that one can't help but be thrilled from time to time when watching it.",1036108800,9,1277,5.028301886792453
1640732,5,B00005OATQ,"A live performance, conceptual, modern and very breathtaking of Richard Wagner's masterpiece, The Ring of the Nibelung. It is excellent to look at, effectively orchestrated, sung well (although not perfectly as did the legendary singers in the Bayreuth Festival with Bohm conducting, a cast which included Birgitte Nillson as Brunhilde). This is a must have for opera fans. Romantic opera reached its zenith with this impressive 4 part German music drama of pride, fatalism and greed. It begins with The Rhinegold, in which the lusty and vindictive dwarf Albrecht steals the gold from the Rhinemaidens and forges a ring.  The second opera, The Valkyrie, accounts the tragic love between Siegmund and Sieglende. Against her father's wishes, Brunhilde, the Valkyrie queen, protects Sieglende although is unable to save Siegmund who is killed. Brunhilde and her Valkyries defy Wotan and take flight on their steeds in the incredible, unforgettable and famous Ride of the Valkyries sequence. But Wotan punishes Brunhilde and casts a dark spell. She is to sleep in a circle of fire and only awaken when she is kissed by a great hero. That great hero is none other than Siegfried, who is raised by the beneveolent Mime. Forging the sword Nothung, he defeats the dragon Falfner and receives the gift of communication with Nature. After which he saves Brunhilde with the traditional kiss. In the last opera, the story reaches its denouement when Siegfried is slain by greedy giants and Brunhilde immolates herself on his funeral pyre. The world ends and Valhalla burns to the ground. The Rhine river overflows and the Rhinemaidens once again take possesion of the ring.",1035763200,2,1661,5.129151291512915
1640733,5,B00005OATQ,"I found this a wonderful viewing experience. This production is one of the greatest operatic productions in the 20th century, and here it is visually and sonically refurbished for DVD release. The staging and direction of this production is always interesting and the level of acting and singing generally reach a very high standard, especially the former. This DVD release has already given me countless hours of great pleasure, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in Wagnerian music drama or indeed opera or stage works in general.",1031529600,4,546,5.0777777777777775
1640734,4,B00005OATQ,"No sound recording of the Ring is perfect, and with filmed recordings, there is even more to object to or defend. For a first ever release of any complete Ring on DVD, this is probably the best compromise of staging, filming, singing, and acting that one could hope for. First some technicalities.
These disks (there are seven disks across a four volume set) are NTSC, not PAL. The regional coding is '0' (universal). So your TV and DVD player have to be NTSC compatible (I think most are anyway). The sound quality is superb. It was recorded digitally and remastered for surround sound. I played it on 2-channel, and it sounded fantastic. The balance of voices and orchestra was truly ideal. The picture quality varies. The original was filmed on video, not on 'film', and it was done in 1980 or 81, so the quality of the video is not very high in some places - especially the beginning of Rheingold - but in 85% of the time, the picture quality is very good, though the colour definition could be better. If you buy the whole Ring as a set it's cheaper overall, and you get a nice cardboard sleeve that the four DVD packs all fit into.
The singing on this Ring is as good as it gets.
Gwyneth Jones sings Brunnhilde wonderfully - one of the half dozen or so singers of the century who could actually sing the role with 100% of the power it needs, and in my opinion the best (and only real) Brunnhilde since Birgit Nilsson; nor does she lack in subtlety and musicality. She is fine to watch as well and seems to take her stage performance as seriously and with as much energy as her singing. It's a wonderful thing to have her Brunnhilde in this DVD format.
Donald McIntyre sings Wotan. He has such an incredibly powerful voice, and is an excellent match to Jones's Brunnhilde, though he has moments which are rather unmusical. His acting is pretty good, but not a highlight. All things considered, he does not disappoint at all.
Siegfried is sung by Manfred Jung, who both looks and sounds the part to a T. Some of his singing now and then is a bit strident, especially in the prologue to Gotterdammerung where he has to 'match' the HUGE voice of G Jones, but especially in the opera Siegfried (part three of the Ring) he is truly magical. Some people take the opposite of this view and find him a bit silly to watch. Siegfried is a sort of non-character, and what characteristics he does have (of bravery, spontaneity, and imbecilic charm) are portrayed by Jung in such a natural and engaging manner. His singing is no less impressive, and he is one of the few Siegfrieds I've heard who really sings all of the notes well. Siegfieds tend to wail and harp a bit, but Jung is very musical.
Peter Hoffmann sings Siegmund with very good voice and tacky 'dramatic' acting which is actually not as irritating as it should be. His Sieglinde is Jeanine Altmayer (of the Janowski Ring) who gives very little of interest as a visual performer, and just manages to do the minimum in terms of singing. Her presence is not a selling point, but it doesn't give too much to object to either.
Heinz Zednik sings both Loge and the Mime in Siegfried. This is a stage animal who, especially in Rheingold, always does something good and appropriate to the character, whether he is singing or not. He is fantastic in Rheingold as the clever and disaffected Loge, and some of the time he tends to over-act in Siegfried, a contrast which is stark especially because in the latter he shares the stage with the incredibly naturalistic Manfred Jung.
Other roles, such as Fricka, Erda, Hunding, Gunther and Waltraute are all sung by people with great voices and above average acting skill, many of whom were to become famous singers in major roles: Hannah Schwarz, Otrun Wenkl, Matti Salminen among them. Franz Mazura as Gunther is perhaps a little soft of voice (he's a bit old) but it fits the role perfectly, and his wonderful acting of the part shines to create a vibrant portrayal of this key 'minor' character.
The orchestral playing is wonderful. Boulez's conducting is full-paced though never lacking in beauty of detail. It never feels rushed, never feels too slow, and he builds climaxes with an exceptionally natural energy. This is conducting of supreme competence.
The staging is by the French designer /director Patrice Chereau. It is tied to the industrial revolution. The sets on the whole are very good, the movement of characters about the stage can be rather weak and confusing. The transitions from scene to scene which are supposed to be seamless are done with the curtain dropping and rising again to show a different set. In my opinion this doesn't really work, and there are certain moments in the staging (the funeral march for example) which are just plain embarrassing. However, for a modern production, this one makes more sense than any other I've seen. I'd rather see a traditional production if given the choice, but in broad terms, and in many many details as well, the staging 'works'. You will probably 'have' to admit that, but whether you like it is up to you.
All in all, a better first DVD Ring could not be imagined.",1023580800,33,5130,4.619934282584885
1640735,1,B00005OATQ,"The audio fluctuates from loud to inaudible - in all four operas.  Attempting to keep up with the sound, by using the volume control, is counterproductive because the sound fluctuations are too numerous.  This proves that a very beautiful production can be completely messed up by handicapped sound technicians - they turned four masterpieces into garbage...",1020988800,5,358,5.375
1640736,5,B00005OATQ,"I received this DVD set as a gift in preparation for my attending The Ring in Bayreuth in this.  While I was not overly happy with the updated and skewed setting of this production, one can find few faults with the singing and orchestra.  The staging technical aspects were awesome !
The choice of no subtitles or English and French translations is very desireable and the text reflected the intent of the lyrics if not word-by-word accurate - making the reading and appreciation that much the better.
  Of course, I prefer the Solti recording but, lacking the video to accompany that production, I found this to be an excellent substitute ....  and an important asset in understanding the complexity of Wagner's music which gradually unfolds upon the 18th or so viewing of the Ring.",1020816000,4,783,4.813432835820896
1640737,5,B00005OATQ,"This is an excellent film version of the famous Bayreuth production that premiered for the Ring's centennial. It certainly is an unusual production, straying far from the naturalistic production seen at the Met in recent years.  Most of the time, the visual images work well and are quite striking -- the opening of Rheingold, for example, takes place in front of what looks to be some sort of hydoelectric dam for example.
The highlight of this Ring is the acting -- Film director Patrice Chereau designed this Ring and really set it up so that the singers actually act and are expressive.  I feel that the Ring operas more than any other opera(s) are really helped by having subtitles to follow the opera -- here the combination of expressive singers and a clear understanding of what is being sung really captures the drama of the works.
There are complaints that this Ring is not well sung, though I think most of the singers were more than adequate (certainly compared to those at recent Bayreuth Rings!).  Some would say that Boulez leads an underpowered performance, which is probably true relative to (say) teh drive of a Solti performance.  Again, this is perfectly fine for this Ring, in part because the somewhat quieter and clearer orchestral texture helps to bring out the themes of the music and highlight the drama.  The conductor's approach makes this a relatively fast moving Ring rather than a weighty Ring.
The DVD picture quality is excellent, camera work is good as our views move around the stage, and the sound is also excellent with little if any audience and stage noise.
This is an excellent Ring to have in any case and would nicely complement the Levine Ring from the Met if and when it is ever fully released on DVD (only Walkure is out now).

It is a definite buy.",1019606400,11,1794,4.697452229299363
1640738,5,B00005OATQ,"Rheingold and Walkure are superb in Chereau's illuminating interpretation. Both contain images that one will never forget, such as the Valkyries actually doing what they are supposed to be doing -- lugging dead bodies to Valhalla! And Chereau's Siegmund (Peter Hoffman) and Sieglinde (Jeannine Altmeyer) are beautiful both to look at and listen to, especially compared to the visually unbelievable equivalents in the Met's Walkure (Gary Lakes and Jessye Norman). I much prefer Chereau's Rheingold and Walkure to the Met's.
However, Chereau goes rather over-the-top in Siegfried and Gotterdammerung. These become more about his directing than they do about the work Wagner actually wrote. In Siegfried especially he plays right to the inherent dramatic weakness of the work, by emphasizing Siegfried's brutishness, at the expense of any possible sympathy for the character. And the finale of Gotterdammerung simply cannot hold a candle to the stunning stagecraft in the Met's production. Thus, I always switch to the Met's video's for the latter two.
Boulez' conduction isn't great -- he seems to blow off many of the big effects, and there is little inner orchestral detail. Levine's for the Met is better, but still falls short to my taste (too slow and ponderous in many places), when compared with the incomparable achievement of Solti on the classic recordings, thankfully still available. Once you have Solti's RING in your ears, nothing else measures up.",1018569600,8,1460,5.324675324675325
1640739,4,B00005OATQ,"Oh I remember watching this Ring Cycle on tv. Unforgettable for its images from Chereau's brilliant concept and Boulez' crisp conducting. The big but however cannot be overlooked: the main roles of Siegfried and Brunnhilde were really not sung as could and should be done. Manfred Jung is simply annoying, nothing is handled convincingly or even 'simply' beautiful and Gwyneth Jones gives us a lot of her wellknown hysterics that have to give the idea that she is being a deep artiste while shrieking to catch some notes somewhere.....",1014422400,3,535,5.022471910112359
1640740,3,B00005OATQ,"This DVD is VERY contrasty and is therefore difficult to discern details. Furthermore the general videography (this recording is from the 70's)apparently one of the early VIDEO recording of this opera gives OVERALL views of scenes and is lacking in closeup shots of individual singers hence, it is is difficult to see and appreciate the character's expressive and psychological developments. Also beware, that the set design is of a more CONTEMPORARY interpretation which some may find difficult in accepting - but this is a matter of personal taste. The most serious flaw in this production is that there are very VERY few chapter queues, which in a massive piece like this is necessaary. The 3 star rating is strictly for the extremely contrasty visuals inadequate chapter queues. Still this set is a BARGAIN considering a complete CD set of the Ring Cycle could be easily double or triple the price!",1008460800,8,902,5.02
1640741,5,B00005OATQ,"I don't have much to add to the other reviewers comments. I think this is great singing and it is a much welcome full Ring cycle in DVD. I have a complaint though in that again, borrowing from the VHS and LaserDisks era, we don't have German subtitles option, that is, the language in which the drama is performed.
In the DVD medium this would be very easy to do and would permit Wagner opera admirers with some basic knowledge of German and of the Ring story (for instance, by repetitive viewing of the English subtitled option)  to follow what is being sung in actual terms.
I once bought a Tristan DVD in the Amazon.uk with the European area format  and it had German subtitle option besides English, whereas the same DVD in Amazon.com seems not to have this option.",1007683200,6,769,4.485714285714286
1640742,5,B00005OATQ,"Okay - I feel a bit foolish (see my previous ""Buyer Beware"").  I have a friend, who has the laser disc, and said this performance is great and worth it.  So, I took a chance.
I think Rudolph Sabor was a bit misleading on his comments, especially concerning the orchestral and vocal performances.  He gives bows to Wotan, Hunding, and Fricka, and completely fails to mention Jones.  Her performance, as Brunnhilde, is nothing short of incredible.  On par with Nilsson, IMHO!  The cast as a whole is great.  Both Sigmund and Siegfried are incredible, and the final duet in Siegfried is glorious - completely rivaling Nilsson and Windgassen!
Sabor seemed to insinuate that Wotan wears a treach coat instead of carrying a spear.  Maybe I miss interpreted what he was saying but Wotan, who does wear an overcoat, does indeed carry a spear.
""Wotan's Farewell"" and ""Magic Fire Music"" are sensational.  The special effects here are stunning - as they are in the ""Immolation Scene"".  ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" is very interesting and performed wonderfully.  ""Wintersturme"" is Walkure is wonderful.  You can't help but question yourself.  Here I am entranced by Siegmund and Sieglinde and then I would remember ""they are twins"" and question, should I be moved here or grossed out?  Same with the ending duet in Siegfried.  However the beautiful singing and glorious staging prevents me from feeling anything but entranced.  The Dragon is Siegfried is cheesy - but hey - it was the 70's.
Yes, this is a more modern approach, but I like it.  I could go on and on.  Of course, being that I just got it yesterday - I have not seen the whole thing - but I've seen a good six hours of it.
Great DVD.  It's so great to see this wonderful characters and this fantastic story come to life.

7948527,5,B00005OATQ,"Patrice Chreaus legendary 1976 centenary production of Wagners mammoth tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen was one of the theatrical events of the 20th century and this DVD set (recorded in 1980) is a mandatory purchase for all Wagnerians. For once Deutsche Grammophons sales spiel does not lie. Just like Stravinskys Rite of Spring decades earlier, this staging caused a riot when it was first seen, the Bayreuth audience split right down the middle in their hatred/love of what Chreau had done to their beloved Ring. Though there had been important precursors (Joachim Herzs 1973 Leipzig production for one), Chreau confidently jumped off in a fresh direction directing the cycle in a way that had never been seen before at Bayreuth. The fact that he did so in such an accomplished way (if it was technically shoddy it would have been easier to dismiss) at the very shrine of Planet Wagner sent shock waves across the world and changed Wagner production (and arguably opera production in toto) forever.

It was Chreau who more than any other introduced into the modern conscience (his ideas actually go back through Giorgio Strehler to Walter Felsenstein in the 1930s-40s and then to Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the century) the idea of regietheater (directors theater) to an art-form which had hitherto been the domain of traditional naturalistic/realistic obeisance to composers stage directions. On seeing Chreaus desecration traditionalists clamored to have their naturalistic Ring returned to them and Bayreuth duly obliged in 1983 with Peter Halls faithful, but ill-fated rendering. Then there was the New York Wagner style inaugurated by Otto Schenk, his 1989 Ring held up as a model production by some, but decried as a sterile museum piece with absolutely nothing to say by others. Regietheater (or produceritis as detractors call it) on the other hand has continued unabated with sometimes outstanding, but often ridiculous results, especially at Bayreuth. The last three shock at all costs Ring productions have barely turned a head, the fact that you could still buy tickets for this years cycle on the net even after the festival had started telling its own story as director-centered ego-trips continue to drive audiences away. In truth Chreau has a lot to answer for, but from where I sit there is obviously good traditional Ring production (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, San Francisco 1990) and bad (Schenk), just as there is good regietheater Ring production (Kupfer, Bayreuth 1988) and bad (La Fura dels Baus, Barcelona, 2007). An open mind is what is required. For me the Chreau is an example of top quality regietheater which works almost perfectly. It should be noted that at Bayreuth the volatility of its hostile reception was matched by the warmth of the 90-minute standing ovation it received at the end of its final performance in 1980.

Its perhaps hard for audiences now to understand the furor surrounding Chreaus production. There have been so many weird and wonderful stagings of the Ring since that the Chreau now looks decidedly old-fashioned and is probably the regietheater production that traditionalists will like the most. In the tradition of Felsenstein Chreau pays attention throughout to the text as sung, and also respects Wagners stage directions a lot more than is given credit for. We are given the Rhine, proper giants, Alberich turning into a proper wurm and then frog, a neo-classical Valhalla, a factory floor Nibelheim, real forest settings, a romantic mountain top quasi-Greek temple Valkyrie rock, a huge dragon wheeled around on stage and a neo-classical Gibichung hall set on the shore of the Rhine. Magic fire traditionally envelops the Valkyrie rock and the tetralogy closes with an immolation of real flames with Valhalla clearly burning in the background. Wagner would have recognized this Ring and outwardly there would appear to be not a lot to complain about.

However, place Chreaus production in the context of every Bayreuth Ring production that had preceded it and the grounds for complaint become obvious. Since the re-opening of the festival in 1951 there had been four different productions, two each by Wagners grandsons  Wieland (1951 and 1965) and Wolfgang (1960 and 1970). All four had emphasized the mythic timelessness of the piece with an abstraction that had contrasted markedly with the naturalism of the three pre-war productions that had also been directed by members of the Wagner family (Wagner himself, his widow Cosima and their son Siegfried) and the 1933-42 Heinz Tietjen cycle. The post-war New Bayreuth Entrmpelung (clearing out the attic) style served the double purpose of de-politicizing Wagner (ie; stripping it of those naughty Nazi trappings) as well as returning to the ideas of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig wherein the stage is stripped of inessentials and the central dramatic idea is honed in on and emphasized along with character psychology. For Wieland in particular it was important to return Wagner to his roots and his origins in ancient Greek tragedy. In his productions characters were turned into virtual Greek statues which combined with the spare treatment of the mise-en-scne to make for music drama which moved the audience primarily through a combination of the music and the ambiguity of time and space. Detractors accused Wieland of turning his grandfathers music dramas into oratorios, but it is now accepted that the Entrmpelung style was one ideal way of producing Wagner. Many people in that first night audience for Chreaus Ring remembered Wieland and Wolfgangs productions fondly and what they now saw amounted to downright provocation.

For Chreau social context was everything and he flouted all convention by setting the Ring squarely in the modern age of an industrializing European society. Das Rheingold is set in the late 18th century pre-industrial world, Die Walkre in the stage of early capitalism with Hunding the first entrepreneur/factory owner, Siegfried in the age of 19th century industrialism, and Gtterdmmerung in the interwar period of fascist capitalism. The pin-pointing of time and place tells us that Chreau is trying to reflect the very world that Wagner himself lived in, and also that far from characters being gods, giants and dwarfs, actually they all represent different aspects of the human species. In this respect Chreaus basic concept (though he denied ever having one as such) is undoubtedly Shavian. George Bernard Shaw argued in The Perfect Wagnerite that the Ring is centrally an allegory on the collapse of capitalism from its internal contradictions with the world of Man waiting for a hero to cleanse away the lame and cramped government of the godsReally, of course, the dwarfs, giants and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes. Chreau with his set designer Richard Peduzzi and costume designer Jacques Schmidt set about stripping the gods of their nobility and making all the characters as close to man (to the very people sitting in the audience) as possible with a clear emphasis on the old story of capitalism encapsulated in the pursuit of power wherein the key characters destroy everything including themselves to get what they want. This left wing socialist message was of course outrageous to the right wing Bayreuth audience who (with more than a little justification!) saw the production as an attack on themselves, a point driven home most of all in Gtterdmmerung act 2 when Siegfried wears black tie, ostensibly to resemble Gunther the weak industrialist who is used by the arch-fascist Hagen, but also of course to resemble the gentlemen of the audience also in black tie and also cogs in (what socialists see as) a fascist machine.

The pursuit of power through capitalism is emphasized throughout the production with the presence of giant factory wheels half-exposed on the stage side. The opening of Das Rheingold is the very image of man abusing nature to generate power in the hydro-electric dam run by the gold lying beneath it. Theres no depiction of ideally clean nature here, the idea of the Rhinemaidens innocent virginity going for nothing. Chreau turns them into Toulouse-Lautrec whores with Alberichs head up one of their skirts presenting sex as both erotic and sordid  an alternative power source to gold. Alberich stealing the gold is very much second best to the power of sexual love which he has to foreswear as part of the deal. This scene was hugely provocative to an audience used to seeing nature pure and unsullied before the arrival of Alberich, though it is in the text (if not the stage directions!) that nature has been violated before the Ring starts with Wotan tearing down a branch from the world ash tree and going on to fashion a spear with the rules by which he seeks to rule the world. These rules have made nature subservient to man (perfectly visualized by the dam and the prostitute Rhinemaidens), and especially subservient to the talented people who devise and administer States and Churches who we meet in the very next scene  Wotan and his fellow gods. Dressed in late 18th century finery and performing on a metal factory-like stage floor with those huge wheels to the side and the finished neo-classical Valhalla (based on Haus Wahnfried, Wagners Bayreuth home) in the background, the gods deal with the giants in the manner of a modern day business transaction. The descent to Nibelheim is a descent to the proletarian factory floor, the split class setting reminiscent of Fritz Langs Metropolis.

Deeply shocking was the violence of the raw physicality on display  Wotan hacking the ring off Alberichs finger with blood visible, Fafner bashing his brother to death with his bare hands, and so the provocation goes throughout Chreaus production. In Die Walkre Hundings hut is a fancy bourgeois establishment adjacent to a factory with the owner an entrepreneur surrounded by henchmen who later corner Siegmund for him to spear nastily through the testicles (the place which had violated his wife Sieglinde) with not one, but several malevolent stabs. Siegfried act 1 is centered round a factory forge with a mechanical contraption moving of its own accord as the sword is made a-new. Wotan would appear to be behind this as he is behind the caged wood-bird planted deliberately to guide Siegfried in act 2. This violates Wagners idea of Siegfried being a free hero, but it does accentuate the idea of the Wlsung race personifying Wotans will. By the time it came to Gtterdmmerung many in the first night audience had had enough. Siegfrieds seizing of the ring from Brnnhilde is viciously presented almost like a rape. The depiction of the Gibichungs uncomfortably close to themselves was the ultimate insult to the audience and when the arch fascist Hagen rammed his spear into Siegfrieds back repeatedly with sadistic relish many members of the audience yelled out, Genug! [Enough!] Many later productions have been even more violent and transgressive to the point that audiences these days watch expecting it. But in 1976 this was all new and incendiary for conservative audiences used to watching a different world disconnected from the twisted everyday realities we are all familiar with. Throughout Chreau denies us the Greek statuary of Wieland Wagner as well as the fairy tale winged helmets, robes and tunics of Norse mythology, forcing us instead to rub our noses in Our own dirty little corner. (Tom Sutcliffe).

Alongside the provocation though Chreau gives us a series of quite wonderfully-lit sets which provide for any number of arresting and deeply memorable stage pictures. The use of spotlights is particularly inspired, especially the strong beam drilling into Alberich and the stage beneath his feet as he curses the ring. The Todesverkndigung forest setting in Die Walkre act 2 is wonderfully atmospheric with soft light contrasting with the otherworldly haloes surrounding Siegmund and Brnnhilde which plays with a huge white sheet draped over the doomed hero in a moment of genius. The preceding Wotan/Brnnhilde encounter is also deeply impressive set in a Valhalla drawing room (not Wagners mountain top!) dominated by a huge Foucaults pendulum which Wotan stops on Das Ende!! at the end of his monolog delivered to his reflection in a giant full-length mirror which he covers with his coat because he can no longer bare the sight of himself. Best of all is the Valkyrie rock modeled after Arnold Bcklins The Isle of the Dead which for once suggests the right kind of ambiguity of both time and place. Like many of the scenes, Wotans act 3 farewell is intensely romantic as is the astonishing last scene of Gtterdmmerung with one of the most convincingly satisfying immolations in my experience, Valhalla burning movingly in the background.

Im not entirely convinced that a worthy Ring can strip away the timeless mythology and still work and I would agree with detractors in saying Chreau narrows the meaning of the tetralogy down too much. The Ring may be an anti-capitalist rant, but it is obviously about much more than that. By seizing on one textual reading Chreau loses sight of all the others. And yet, the romantic stage pictures he provides combine superbly with an astonishingly high degree of quality acting to completely carry us away and convince us that this is a truly great Ring. Chreau (now sadly no longer with us) was a true man of the theater who believed in long periods of intensive rehearsal between actors leading to the finished result which is both psychologically convincing and completely real. He reduces all the characters of the Ring to mortals, but he makes them feel for and against each other in a way that in 1976 was extremely rare in the opera house. That was the most important ingredient of Chreaus revolutionary take on Wagner, namely the introduction of serious theater into opera production which had hitherto been a matter of outdated static convention. All the central relationships (Wotan/Fricka, Alberich/Mime, Siegmund/Sieglinde, Wotan/Brnnhilde, Siegfried/Mime, Siegfried/Brnnhilde) are superbly drawn with singers basically becoming their characters for the time they are before us. The erotic abandon between the Wlsungs in Die Walkre is extraordinarily intense and giddily romantic, while Wotans farewell to Brnnhilde is a matter of great tenderness and held-in passion. Siegfried/Mime make an inspired double comic act in Siegfried act 1 and those intricate little encounters in act 2 are done with obvious relish by all. The awakening of Brnnhilde and the opulence of the closing duet is outstandingly rendered in that fabulous set as is the Gtterdmmerung prologue love music farewell. Possibly the greatest single span of music in the Ring is Gtterdmmerung act 2 and Chreau makes it superbly gripping, the setting combining with the way the singers react around each other to pitch-perfect electrifying effect. On a personally romantic level this Ring leaves almost all other productions for dead. The only other production on DVD that betters it for me is the Kupfer/Barenboim 1991/92 Bayreuth version which takes off from Chreau in the fabulous movement of the singers and their acting, but in a setting (the famous worlds highway) which effectively returns the Ring to timeless mythology where it rightfully belongs. One thing Chreau does do better though is the final immolation scene which is overwhelming in its effect. Kupfers ending is a disappointing whimper beside it, but on virtually all other points, he scores over Chreau. Especially Kupfer/Barenboim were blessed with extraordinary singing.

Musically alas, the Chreau Ring is flawed, but it is better I would say than any Ring coming after it except for the Barenboim/Kupfer production. Pierre Boulez was Wieland Wagners surprise choice to conduct Parsifal in 1966 and it was he who recommended Chreau for the centenary Ring a decade later. As with Parsifal (one of the fastest readings ever in the Festspielhaus) Boulez zips through the Ring very quickly blowing away the cobwebs with an extraordinary passion which belies his cold analytic reputation. The orchestra rebelled against him in 1976, but by 1980 they had been won over and on these DVDs we hear a wonderful blend which is much closer to Karl Bhm (1966) than it is to Barenboim (1992). The problems come with the singing which is uneven. There are no problems with the Nibelungs and the giants, all four voices commanding the sound picture as they should. Hermann Becht is an outstanding if not obviously evil Alberich, Heinz Zednik excels as his slippery brother Mime and steals the show completely in Das Rheingold as Loge. Hes the link between Gerhard Stolze and Graham Clark as great Bayreuth Loge/Mimes. Matti Salminen and Fritz Hbner make perfect baleful black as black giants. Salminen is my favorite Hunding on record while Hbner dominates the stage as Hagen with superb malevolence. The Wlsungs make a very good looking pair, Peter Hoffman singing with heroic ardor and making those cries of Wlse! long and spine-tingling. Jeannine Altmeyer is a slightly unsteady Sieglinde (not ideally pure of tone) and makes for a wobbly Gutrune. Hanna Schwarz makes a biting Fricka firm of tone and decisive (her appearance in Walkre act 2 is a highlight). The biggest problems come with the biggest roles and as they are on the stage the longest, this is a serious flaw. I have to say that I cant be completely objective about this recording. This was my first Ring recording, the one I listened to on LP endlessly as a teenager pouring over the libretti with an enthusiasm I can barely muster now. Inside me Donald McIntyre, Manfred Jung and Gwyneth Jones have always been Wotan, Siegfried and Brnnhilde, and I love their performances deeply, but when I later discovered the best Ring recordings of the 50s and 60s (Bhm, Krau, Knappertsbusch especially) I realized the shortcomings of what I had been used to. McIntyres Wotan is of the noble type, ideal for Das Rheingold, but ill-equipped to reveal the complexities we see in Die Walkre let alone the world weary bitterness of the Wanderer in Siegfried. His voice is soft, sometimes underpowered and never less than dignified, but he doesnt capture Wotan in his fullness (on record for me only Hermann Uhde, Hans Hotter and later John Tomlinson do that). Manfred Jung would be welcomed today as a savior among heldentenoren, but sadly the microphones reveal his less than heroic tone which must qualify a gallant effort. He gives much pleasure, but cannot get to the places Siegfried Jerusalem let alone Wolfgang Windgassen could. Jerusalem by the way gives a cameo here as Froh which is very effective. Dame Gwyneth alas is the biggest problem for me, a wildly unpredictable voice spreading at the top and wobbling at the bottom. As a teenager I was astonished by her thinking that her singing of the love duets and then the immolation was extraordinary, but when I heard Birgit Nilsson, Astrid Varnay and Martha Mdl do it I realized what I had been missing. One thing does remain with me about Dame Gwyneth and that is the way she sings Ruhe, ruhe, der got [Rest now o god] early in her immolation scene. That send shivers up my spine in a way that no other singer even has or probably ever will!

A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians then, its a legendary production well worth paying close attention. Chreaus directing is outstanding in every way. Musically its not as great, but then I don't think its as bad as some have said, and certainly on DVD only the Kupfer/Barenboim Bayreuth Ring betters it. Finally I should mention that the aspect ratio is 4:3 as this comes from the days before wide screen. The images have been cleared up by remastering but ghosting is still inevitable in scenes where light and dark are contrasted in extremes. There are no problems with the sound which is full, bright and relays that amazing Bayreuth glow.

most moving productions of the ""Ring"" ever. Is this set better

7948531,4,B00005OATQ,"At this writing this edition is out of stock. I only hope it isn't out of print. That would be a crime.
Traditionalists won't like this thought, but it seems any ""setting"" for a staging of the Ring Cycle is secondary to the point of the drama, even if Wagner himself specified otherwise. His musical odyssey about the mighty trapped by their own devices and the devastating effect it has on everything around them has always been relevant. Wotan's tale of being trapped by contracts could be easily be the story of the dilemma faced by any world leader. The idea that Patrice Chreau's staging lent an anti-capitalist spin to the cycle doesn't hold up. That was always part of the story. Capitalism is just one of many names for systematic greed that leads to rulers and societies destroying themselves from within. Those themes permeate the text of the Ring and are well served by any staging that tells the story well.
Boulez' interpretation is very light but it serves the music well. That's not to say the thunder is gone; it's not. If anything the thunder seems louder. Wagner's scores are alive with subtle nuances of expression. The brisk tempo Boulez used makes those subtleties sparkle, a touch which gives more radiance to the piece as a whole. Because of that those infamous ""dull quarter hours"" are fewer and farther between.
It (apparently) wasn't his intent but Wagner established the formula Hollywood uses for leaving stories open ended enough to produce sequels. Ring I (Das Rheingold) closes with the major players fighting over the money. There are a few illegitimate kids running around to throw wrenches in the works too. Ring II outstrips the first episode and gets a glorious title. Die Walkre recaps the first production, ties up loose threads and creates new ones for a new chapter. Son of Siegmund (Siegfried) carries out all the standard sequel chores and proves that incest produces morons. Gwyneth Jones reminds viewers that aging beauties don't always look great in the morning. (Jones is splendid so don't take that comment too seriously.) The piece ends on a happy note but with enough loose ends for another four hours. Ring IV: The Final Chapter (Gtterdmmerung) ties up those threads without creating news ones and ends in a blaze of glory. It also teaches the lesson Hollywood didn't learn; get out while you're on top. Anyone staging this has to has to work around these things. That means doing an effective enough job of it to suspend the viewers' belief for a while. That's no small task. Chreau's staging won't be perfect for anybody. No staging could be with a work of this scope. His vision is very effective though. The costuming leans toward the nineteenth century but is in a state of decay. With a few exceptions the suits, though of fine quality, look as if they haven't been pressed, cleaned or mended since about the time of ancient Egypt. Much of the set is cast in the same mould. The home of the Rhine Maidens is a sewer. Valhalla is crumbling and Hunding's people look like concentration camp victims. But that's fine. That decay is the price of greed, and the Ring is about greed and it's consequences.
The cast is fabulous. There are too many to name all of them but a few warrant mention. Not enough can be said about Donald McIntyre in the role of Wotan. The character has to be proud, sympathetic, just and unjust all at once. McIntyre brings this off well. His rage is fearsome yet his love for his errant child melts the heart. Manfred Jung captures all there is of Siegfried. He's especially good portraying the true nature of Siegfried's bravery-he's too dumb to be afraid. Franz Hbner is as loathsome a Hagen as there could ever be. The slime is just about oozing out of him. Peter Hofmann and Jeanine Altmeyer are wonderful as the twins. The passion in their singing makes their situation a sympathetic one despite the crime of their union. Heinz Zednik steals the scene wherever he appears, be it as Loge or Mime. As Mime he's hilarious. This man could probably have an alternate career in film. He developed a set of mannerisms for ""Mime"" and maintains them consistently throughout his time on stage. As well, he has great comic timing. That's something that can't be taught. Then there's the lady who (to my mind) dominates this production. It's true that Gwyneth Jones wasn't young when this was filmed and there are times when harsh lighting displays it. Still, age or no, she is a beautiful lady. And she can act and she can sing. Can she ever sing! She combines control with unbridled passion in a way most can only dream about. In the end it's hard to imagine a better Brnnhilde. She is magnificent!
Picture quality is good. For television it was the best of it's time and it holds up well. The sound is even better. The old analog recordings weren't as clean but they have a more lifelike sound than digital recordings. That's particularly noticeable with the brass and the bass instruments from the string sections. The re-mastering of this edition serves those qualities well.
The only complaint I have is that the individual works should be available as such instead of just as a set. Each drama is a self contained story and can be enjoyed as such. Offering them separately might create a wider range of interest in the Cycle. Given its quality and importance that could only be a plus.",1081814400,13,5362,4.711395101171459

Although it is often said that the standard of Wagnerian singing has declined a lot over the years, what I heard on this recording is still quite admirable for most of the time. Besides, what a high standard of acting the singers are able to present here!
The production, though having its eccentricities, work very well for most of the time. In fact, I found the production dramatically as riveting as anything I've ever seen in the theatre. Obviously a great production. The videography is excellent, too.
My love for opera has advanced by leaps and bounds after watching this production. I would recommend this marvellous set to all.",1066867200,7,686,4.822033898305085
7948533,5,B00005OATQ,"This production will not appeal to those who prefer a traditional approach in staging Wagner's masterpiece. It is also true that up-dating the background to somewhere sometime during the Industrial Revoluation may have stripped the drama of its universality. Yet, I think the director, Patrice Chereau, merely wish to test out the Ring's drama in a specific historical and political context, and within such an ambit his ""experiment"" is, on the whole, a success.
Much has been said about the superlative standard of acting of the singers in this production as well as Brian Large's wonderful videography. I also tend to think that the singing is also very good, at least better than the case of many Wagner productions that we're treated to nowadays. I admire Gwyneth Jones's Brunnhilde, which is one of the singer's greatest achievements on records. Donald McIntyre's Wotan is tonally monotonous, but his interpretation has considerable stature. Hofmann and Altmeyer are pretty moving as the pair of Walsung twins and most of the other roles are more than competently handled. Boulez's conducting is accurate, and although his approach isn't too heroic (as one may expect for the Ring), this swift-paced approach is not out of place (and pace) with Chereau's dramatic and passionate production.
The video does show a bit of its age, but both the picture and sound qualities on this DVD release are still very good. On the whole, I think this is an interesting and cherishable production, and one which the audience may discover newer things with each repeated viewing. In fact, I found myself growing more and more fond of the production and performance, which probably is evidence of their success. I can warmly recommend it for home viewing.",1055116800,13,1744,5.080139372822299
7948534,4,B00005OATQ,"There have probably been more words about this (in)famous production than about any other production, with the possible exception of the first in 1876.  This is the centennial production at Bayreuth, which debuted in 1976.  This particular version was made especially for video in 1980.  It was made in the Festspielhaus but it is not a recorded live performance.
Patrice Chereau had never staged an opera when he was invited to produce the centennial production at Bayreuth.  Legend has it that on the opening night in '76, the production was almost booed off the stage; four years later, when the production closed, there was a 45 minute standing ovation.
The best thing about this production is that it takes the drama entirely seriously, completely discarding operatic traditions including the ones that Wagner himself was explicit about.  The Rhinemaidens are prostitutes, the Rhine is shown as a water processing plant.  In Rhinegold, the actors are dressed in 18th century gear - powdered wigs, etc.  By the time we get to Gotterdaemmerung, the characters are in early 20th century evening dress.  This is an a-historical production, though.  There is never any sense of moving forward in time - this is evident from the first two scenes of Rhinegold:  The Rhinemaiden scenes are post-industrial; the gods have powdered wigs, while Alberich, et al. look indistinctly late 19th century.  Walkure and Siegfried are similarly unanchored in time - it could be the 15th century; it could be the year your mother was born.
As to the singing, it ranges from satisfactory to excellent.  Without running through the whole cast, suffice it to say that the principles are satisfying.  Donald McIntyre's Wotan is not as musically dominating as, say, James Morris's, but Wotan's dilema and his growing desparation are perfectly conveyed by this great singing actor.  Gwyneth Jones was past her prime in 1980 (she tends to be a little wild, vocally); but what a great performance!  First of all, much of her singing is very fine, and all of it is intensely moving.  Peter Hofman is good and good looking, and (can't remember her name) is a soulful Sieglinde.  It's a rare treat to see two slim, blond Wolsang twins and find their relationship physically credible (as opposed to the Met production which has a black Sieglinde and a white Siegmund, for example).  Matti Salminen's Hunding is surpassed only by his Hagen in the Met production.  What a great actor and singer he was/is.
This is really an essential DVD set and it comes much cheaper than it ever did on VHS or laser disc.  Every Perfect Wagnerite will want this set.",1051833600,40,2621,4.940639269406392
7948535,5,B00005OATQ,"This is not a flawless performance or production. However, what makes it so fascinating is the innovative (but never too wild) production concept as well as the dedication of the entire cast.
Although this production strips the drama of a certain degree of heroism (and in this production, the central character of Siegfried is quite an unlovable one), it does provide an interesting angle to view the epic drama. The dramaturgy works well most of the time, and the stage direction is generally very good, with a few very imaginative and dramatically compelling touches.
I don't quite like Boulez's interpretation of the music. However, to be fair, his reading is concentrated and surprisingly (for Boulez) passionate. It serves the production well enough. As I've said above, the entire cast deserve great praise, even though they may not be the greatest Wagnerian singers of all time. Their acting is of an extremely high standard and the singing is often good or more than good. They make a very fine ensemble indeed.
Brian Large's videography is superb, which makes this DVD set an item to treasure.",1049932800,9,1103,5.0
