8579044,4,B00CA4S3KS,"I bought Echo Bridge's ""5 Original Cult Classics"" cheap and I wasn't disappointed by the quality. The sound and picture are good compared to other movies out of copyright and suitable for broadcast.  Watch ""Night of the Living Dead"" again just to see how zombies pop in from the side of the frame. Watch ""Piranha"" (1972 Venezuela) to see what the 1978 Joe Dante film ripped off with a bigger budget. ""Carnival of Souls"" is an effective trippy film about a woman's experience of being dead. It will put a real zap on your brain. ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" is a better jack Nicholson movie than ""The Terror."" Maniac is an early gore shocker with work by Tom Savini.",1476057600,,665,4.541666666666667
