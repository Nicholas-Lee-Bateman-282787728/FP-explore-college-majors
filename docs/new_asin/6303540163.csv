It begins in October 2004. Ms. Mapes meets a man for a consultation. She is a producer for 60 Mimutes, she finds news stories. In April Dan Rather addresses a audience after he is introduced. He interviews an Army General about Abu Ghraib, which uncovered a scandal. Mapes tells about an investor in Arbusto, then about how the son of a Congressman was put into the Air National Guard. A news team is looking into George W. Bushs past. Is there a scandal here? They make telephone calls to various people. One man says he had documents that will create a scandal; but they are copies. [So too the Pentagon Papers.] They see a videotape of a politician who didn't know he was being recorded. Dan Rather gets involved. There is a question about the documents, the chain of custody. Can they get the name of the man who gave them the documents? There are differences in the signature but the experts say they are the same man.

Mapes talks to General Hodges about the memos. Is this confirmation? There is a question about superscripts: were they available then? The TV program discusses the pasts of Kerry and Bush. A site questions the authenticity of the documents because of the proportional fonts. [The IBM Executive typewriters used proportional fonts in the 1960's.] they must find the th superscript in the official records from that time; they do! General Hodges now says the papers are fake! This causes a problem. CBS management wants to talk to Mapes source. The source has a new story about the papers! Will he go on the air? Yes; he admits he didn't tell all. To protect people. CBS wants an investigation of the story. They must protect themselves now. CBS News apologizes for the story. An outside law firm will investigate. A private investigator was hired to check their files. There is a dramatic scene on the tenth floor when a reporter is ejected!

Is the investigation fixed to blame the reporters? Mapes father turns on her. [Does he have a hidden agenda?] Her husband asks Mary to fight back. Mary is advised on her defense. There will be no official record, they say. Mapes is questioned by two lawyers and holds her ground. Back home she gets a call from Dan Rather at night, he talks about the news as a business. Dan will no longer the anchorman after the election. Mapes tells off the panel that investigates her. They respond at attack her. Mapes explains the difficulty in forging the documents. Is the burden of proof on the reporter? The investigation leads to her termination, and others. Dan gives his farewell on TV. Goodnight. That panel found no evidence of political bias in the report. But four were fired. CBS won an award for Mapes report on Abu Ghraib.

The second term of George W. Bush led to the worst economic depression since the 1930's. Even two terms of Obama couldn't undo the damage from NAFTA, CMO, and other Wall Street swindles. Could Mapes report on Abu Ghraib resulted in a plot to ruin her career? Since then economic changes led to a decline in newspapers and magazines, and jobs for journalists. This movie is based on Mapes book Truth and Duty, her account of this event. How has CBS been doing since 2004? This movie is slow moving at times.",1518480000,,3218,4.63047285464098

Many programs such as these deem them fact-based and I think the makers know there are a ton of ppl who want to hear precisely that.  Further, I know many African-American Christians who are inspired by Ethiopian Christians as a group that practiced the religion long before colonialism.  I think a bunch of my same-race peers will just love this.
Still, a lot of what is presented here seems like filler.  After presenting what little info out there about Sheba exists, we just basically see a documentary host going on some visits of different places.  At one point, he chews on something called kaht.  He calls it bitter and said it helps people stay awake, but never states whether it has caffeine in it.  Still, no story says Queen Sheba chewed the substance.  We see the host buying a sword that men traditionally wear in this area.  However, there's no statement that the men travelling with Sheba wore these.
Many a documentary detail how ""dangerous"" it is for the documentary makers to take the trips they take.  While I agree that local politics or schisms may have put the host in danger, this has little to do with Sheba.  From other sources I've heard, these gatekeepers often want payment or resources before they will let you film anything.  This doc never says whether money was paid to get the footage seen here.
When I first read a Biblical passage about Sheba in a high school English class, it was emphasized that she said to Solomon, ""I am black and comely.""  Here we see some interracial, but mostly intraracial, depictions of her and Solomon.  I'm pretty sure in one fairly recent movie, Sheba is played by Vivica A. Foxx and Solomon by Victor Garber.  The racial composition of this couple is basically never discussed here.  I wonder if that decision was made as some supposedly think that the US is ""post-racial"" now that President Obama is in office.  If you wanted to hear spicy stories like those of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, you will not receive them here.
Because there is conflicting views about whether Sheba reigned in Ethiopia or southern Arabia, it makes sense that the narrator would visit both places.  Still, it irritated me when he concluded by saying, ""My search for Sheba has been a success!""  No, it wasn't!  A bunch of bits and pieces strung together to make a 45-minute program is not what I would call successful.  This is just some lighthearted viewing that will make many folk happy, even though it is quite surface-y in many regards.",1389225600,,2645,4.716775599128541
7852180,3,6303540163,"This could have been a great documentary, but it turns out they packed 50% nonsense and 50% great ideas.
The nonsense moments are at times so awkward and uncanny that one may think they have been planted there by design.
A few examples:
1 Jordan Maxwell explaining Dalai Lama means lamb of god. Every cretin knows it means ocean of wisdom in Tibetan.
2 Bill Jenkins claiming the bible was translated from Arabic.
3 Bill Jenkins saying the the cup is a symbol of judaism.
4 Derek Partridge talking about prehistoric men while images of dinosaurs are on screen as a potential threat to early men.
5 Michael Chandler claiming that SOLOMON is sun in three languages, then can't think which ones and Partridge suggests SOL is Spanish for Sun, etc...talking about texts written ages before even Latin emerged.
The unnamed books they are quoting from are:
1 ANCIENT EGYPT THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD by G. Massey (1907)
2 BIBLE MYTHS by T.W. Doane (1882)
Both readily available online for free.

A good watch with a few grains of salt.",1277596800,,1023,4.651933701657459
