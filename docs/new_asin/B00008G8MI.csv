1846390,5,B00008G8MI,"This CD turned out to be the same ""Desire/Salt On Our Skin"" as the one starring Vincent D'onofrio and Greta Scacchi.  No one seems to know how the ""Claudine Auger"" name got in there.  However, upon contacting the seller, he/she immediately made a refund of same, since I already had the D'onofrio/Scacchi copy and didn't want another, and he/she was a very honest and quick to apologize businessperson whom I'd rate as 100%.  The original film is quite beautiful, the story of a 20-some year long love affair made all the more poignant because of the obvious chemistry between the stars.  Well worth watching.",1233360000,5,609,4.826923076923077
1846391,5,B00008G8MI,"If you're a D'Onofrio fan, you'll really want to own this one.  It's a story of passion that seems to ever have the one lover out of step with the other.  So many opportunities are given in this film for us to whisper, ""I wouldn't do that!""  But, ""they"" do and you get to go along for the ride.

You will see little exchanges that are ever so human between the lovers that eventually, you'll be doing something similiar and be reminded of the film.  It'll haunt you like that.

There's passion...there's foolishness...there's love and understanding - what's not to like?  It's humanity in all it's glory and nonsense!  I'd highly recommend this movie as an afternoon get away!",1225497600,21,676,4.621848739495798
1846392,5,B00008G8MI,"It's a wonderfull film, tender, real, romantic. I love it since it's in video!",1225152000,6,78,4.642857142857143
1846393,2,B00008G8MI,"An interesting way to review the careers of Scacchi and D'Onofrio, but otherwise, it's a no go. Long term adultery is not a sympathetic love story. It's hard to empathize with Georges (Scacchi), a woman who doesn't want to be the wife of a fisherman, but wants to bang him annually, for old time's sake. Gavin (D'Onofrio) portrays the traditionally female role of the seduced partner who then feels awfully, awfully bad about betraying the spouse. They are supposed to age from late teens to late middle age, but mostly D'Onofrio grows more and more and more facial hair. One becomes frightened of how he will appear at their next assignation. Of the two, he is nevertheless more convincing in the aging process, and in his final scene the beard is at last under control and practically believable. D'Onofrio looks very fine in his introductory scene, and Scacchi is lovely, but the story is unconvincing, overwrought and overlong.",1150329600,21,931,4.89873417721519
1846394,5,B00008G8MI,A touching movie of a love story through time with outstanding performances of the two main characters which is really worth watching and buying. I definitely recommend it to all those who like to watch quality movies.,1123891200,5,218,4.918918918918919
1846395,5,B00008G8MI,Best love story I ever seen... Perfect movie.. But only in VHS:(,1088380800,6,64,4.416666666666667
1846396,5,B00008G8MI,"This is the most sensual love story of two lovers seperated by both class and custom.  George is an intelligent Parisian rich in both looks and money.  Gavin is a strong young Scotsman working hard to make a living, destined to be a fisherman.  The two meet in the countryside of Scotland where George's family vacations.  The chemistry is instant.
Their love affair begins and ends and begins again so many times.  They are tested.  They are pulled apart by forces both within and without. One thing is constant-  their love.
You have to see this movie.  It is the best movie I have ever seen.  It is the only movie I can watch over and over without boredom.  It's a tear jerker and a heart warmer.  ...",1013904000,9,704,4.421875

1846408,4,B00008G8MI,"Vincent D'Onofrio is amazingly hot, though the plot (spoiler!) involves long-term infidelity. This made sympathy for the characters hard for me, but it was a pretty good movie.",1414800000,,176,5.321428571428571

1846411,4,B00008G8MI,"Early Vincent D'Onofrio -  saw it on TV and finally managed to find a copy for my movie library.  Earthy, sensuous and sexy, tragic and sad.  Most reviews overthink it, I just enjoyed it.  Love Greta Scacchi too.",1396137600,3,212,4.5
1846412,5,B00008G8MI,"Gorgeous scenery; gorgeous characters. Vincent D'Onofrio's (Gavin McCall) bare chested hay-tossing scene should have made posters. Conflict of cultures, lifestyles, education, expectations hit the characters in their youth. Her George's (Greta Scacchi) snobbery costs her dearly. The reunions are as poignant as the first parting. The settings, homes, coasts, Paris are great framers for these 2 beautiful actors. Keep the hankies nearby. It is a sensuous, R-rated, 'same time next year"" but without humor.",1378684800,3,506,5.851351351351352

1846415,4,B00008G8MI,Worth buying if you are a Vincent D'Onofrio fan - he makes the film and shines with his portrayal as Gavin.  I was disapointed by the ending though - I would have loved to see more about the character's illness.,1360454400,2,211,4.275
