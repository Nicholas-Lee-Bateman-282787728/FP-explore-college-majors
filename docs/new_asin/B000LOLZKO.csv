8174897,5,B000LOLZKO,"This is a dvd from the best Salsa instructional series so far produced.

Master Salsa teacher Eric Freeman has produced a great must have series on dvd.

Highly recommended.

The first move is one of our favorites. It is part of a series of moves performing Salsa with only one hand & arm. We use this series as a rest period/song rather than leave the dance floor. It also enables you to get close to your partner as well.

( Before we go on with our review we would just like to say this. This video has many moves that can be used by physical therapists to teach people in wheelchairs how their partners can still dance with them. This first move in this video is used by Neal for women with only one arm how they can still dance. Many of the chair moves can be used by males in leg casts or wheelchairs.)

Move No. 12 is a MASTER LEVEL move. This move alone is worth the price of this video. Excellent move with a very detailed breakdown.

The styling & unique rotations for many of the moves make them well worth learning. The very detailed moves / twists/ dips done to various musical counts make this video suitable to all styles of Salsa dancers.

There is a cross section of moves from basic social to more performance type moves. There are moves that will suit all levels & types of dancers in this videos.

Move 23 is a favorite. It is part of the Kissing dips series. You do not have to kiss your partner but this is a great dip for it.
In the advance classes here most people dance with their own social partner so we teach this dip with a kiss to the forehead or lips. It just adds to the romantic feeling you can get if dancing to Salsa romantic music.

The sit down moves were excellent. The moves teach you how to have fun & use your dance floor area to enhance your dancing style.

Move No 41 are a must see for all males. Knowing this move alone was worth the price of this video.
As males we all have danced with women that we do not want to for various reasons. This is the best & firm & politest way to get rid of them. Even the women here laughed & could understand the need for us to learn this move.

We would just like to say that it very rude for males to refuse to dance with a female if he is free. This is part of the Salsa culture.

Overall an amazing video with some very unique moves.",1167782400,,2317,4.124444444444444
