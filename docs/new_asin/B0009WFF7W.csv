2327448,5,B0009WFF7W,I watched this video on my computer and thought it was an amazing true story.  Great!  performances by all the cast.  It's interesting that truth is stranger than fiction.  I really want to know more about the characters.  Was she as beautiful as Richardson?  What did her parents do to find her? How did she end up this way?  Where were they for all the years on the run?  Terrific!,1302048000,,383,4.371428571428571

 You know sometimes you get a pack and one is good and the other sucks? Well this is not the case. A must have for Lifetime fans!",1216771200,,198,4.2105263157894735
2327452,5,B0009WFF7W,This was one of the best lifetime type dramas I have seen. It is also one of the most disturbing. The behavior of this woman unsettled me so that I have been trying to find out what the final conclusion was on the internet. I have been unsucessful thus far. I know of other situations in real life where a spouse was accused of murdering (or attempting to murder) their wife/husband...one of which happened down the street from me (von Bulow in the 1980's) yet this is more chilling.,1169164800,9,483,4.438202247191011
2327453,5,B0009WFF7W,"I loved the ""lies my mother told me"", since i love lifetime, its a great movie to watch after work. Its an intense sad/good movie to just watch.

8068269,5,B0009WFF7W,"I love both of these movies, and both are based on truth. It has been said that truth is stranger than fiction, and both of the twists and turns in these stories prove the theory true. I love looking at James Brolin and he is hot in WIDOW ON THE HILL. Both casts are great and it is good to get a two for one deal.",1502841600,,314,3.772727272727273
8068270,2,B0009WFF7W,"Based on a true story, but not entirely accurate.  In addition to the hospice nurse, there was a doctor and another nurse also caring for the wife.
 Donna, the hospice nurse, was actually only 8 years younger than the real life husband, Hamilton Somerville.  At the time, he was 47 and she was 39, not 30 and 65 as portrayed in the movie.  Also, Hamilton's mother lived with them at the time and Donna ended up caring for her after his wife died.  His Mother died shortly thereafter.  They were married for 10 years, when he was getting ready to initiate divorce proceedings.  Donna had just gone back to work at a local hospice, giving her access to meds.  They found codeine, morphine and oxycodone in his stomach which she had to have given him, because he had not seen any doctors.  The evidence was only circumstantial and it was trial by Judge and not jury, Donna was found not-guilty.  The Judge said he could not determine whether he was abusing drugs or she gave them to him,  even though there was no evidence of medication or med packaging found at the home as portrayed in the movie.  He was also overweight and a heavy smoker.  Donna lost the civil suit to the daughters for the estate.",1502323200,,1199,4.470046082949309
