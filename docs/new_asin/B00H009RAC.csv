6125130,5,B00H009RAC,"Great documentary about a trailblazing athlete. Having trouble getting to the gym? Don't really feel like going for a run? Don't know how you'll possibly pull it together to get that big project done? Watch this documentary, let Diana motivate the excuses right outta you, and get it done.",1407974400,,289,4.918367346938775
6125131,5,B00H009RAC,Great story.  I wish they had shown more of the final successful swim.  Never give up indeed. Everyone should watch this.,1398816000,3,121,4.714285714285714
6125132,5,B00H009RAC,Diana is an amazing woman.  I was so inspired by her will and dedication to attempt what seemed to be an impossible task.  This is a great story of the human spirit.,1398211200,3,165,4.125
6125133,5,B00H009RAC,"A testament to fortitude, endurance, and dedication to the heart's desire. And what an amazing story of the love and support that rises up to meet it.",1391904000,3,150,4.592592592592593
6125134,5,B00H009RAC,"We all pretty much know how the story ends.  But this film focuses on the journey and much of the backstory unknown to many.

With every failure you hear Diana sadly voice in disbelief how it was the last attempt, agonizing at how daunting letting go of her dream will be, only to see her try again.  With each failed attempt you see her gain a piece of knowledge she would need and use on the successful swim.

The documentary does a great job of deconstructing her journey to show her success came from the knowledge gained from her failures, painful life experiences going back to her childhood and an overwhelming need to complete something.

My only disappointment was that her ""3"" pieces of advice were not included - which were quite significant.  I wish the end scene kept running long enough to show that.  Other than that - well done.

I hope she creates another documentary that includes more from her interviews since the successful swim, how completing this need to swim form Cuba to Florida has changed her, and what new goals she has for the future.",1391817600,3,1064,4.592592592592593

6125136,4,B00H009RAC,Her determination is there. Her effort is there. The doubters will not be satisfied. it mainly focuses on her first and second efforts not the one where she makes it. But the organization is amazing. Good film.,1391299200,,210,4.702702702702703

8628911,5,B00H009RAC,"Had no idea what it took for Diana Nyad to accomplish what she did, and the magnitude of her accomplishment. I watched it twice in a row to share it with my mom. We were both inspired and I want to read the book. I would recommend it without hesitation.",1505692800,,253,4.08

8628915,5,B00H009RAC,"Great movie, the only drawback was they spent so much time on her failed attempts, and very little on her successful journey.
