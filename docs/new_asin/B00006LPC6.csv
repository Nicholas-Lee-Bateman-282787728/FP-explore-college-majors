1784958,5,B00006LPC6,"...Henry James once said that it was the germ of a situation, the imaginative possibility, not its final historical explication, that inspired his stories. So. Wenders is inspired by a paranoid thriller, just as Hitchcock was in ""Strangers on a Train,"" another Highsmith thriller. But in each case, of course, the director uses the novel to tell an entirely different story, the story he has in mind.  In  Wender's case, the story is of a kind of doubled ambivalence, a meditation on the relationship between west Germany and ""America"", a political, economic, political and, to be honest, military quandary, and the relationship between European ""craft"" and American ""cultural imperialism."" Let's be clear on this: Jonathan is a craftsman, from the old European school, .... And yet Wender, in an interview I saw, in his thickly accented but otherwise perfect English, said, ""Rock und Roll safed my life.""
  Wender has always been resolutely apolitical in the kinds of films he makes, but his camera does not lie, and for that reason, his movies are charged with political questions that are deeply human and personal, and make me think more about what I believe.",991267200,8,1163,5.041666666666667
1784959,5,B00006LPC6,"A superb rendering by Wim Wenders of the Patricia Highsmith novel Ripley's Game, with Dennis Hopper and Bruno Ganz in memorable acting.

I felt that Dennis Hopper was playing a  continuation of his Easy Rider role.  The European locale was interesting,  if bleak, and, again did not provide the ironic contrast of the French  provincial setting.  Bruno Ganz was excellent, however, as the troubled  craftsman.  The denouement was rather tenuous.",949708800,10,552,5.634146341463414
1784981,5,B00006LPC6,"An extremely fine movie. This is from the era when movie makers were still experimenting with making art. Dennis Hopper calls Wim Wenders one of the few movie makers whose films are high art. This is Bruno Ganz's first real movie. This is the movie that gave Wenders the opportunity to break out in American movies. It also foreshadows some of Dennis Hopper's later roles, like in Blue Velvet a little bit (although Hopper does not mention that in the commentary). This version has a lot of extras including interviews with Ganz, from fairly recently, and a commentary track with Wenders and Hopper. This is an inexpensive DVD by Criterion standards. It is 2 disks. The movie does not follow the novel, exactly. Also, the scenes play out a little bit like diorama vignettes. This is not an action movie. But, there are some active scenes. The novel has an even more suspenseful conclusion. The acting is excellent, and the characters are very distinct. It would have been nice to also have a commentary from the actress Lisa Kreuzer who is excellent in this movie. Her character is very fleshed out and realistic. There are also extra scenes that flesh it out even more. I watch this movie over and over. Sometimes, I watch it without the sound in the background as I work.

1784988,4,B00006LPC6,"The American Friend,"" directed by Wim Wenders, is an homage to Hollywood film noir, adapted from Ripleys Game, the third Tom Ripley novel by Patricia Highsmith (Strangers on a Train). Hamburg picture framer and paint restorer Jonathan Zimmermann (Bruno Ganz) meets Tom Ripley (Dennis Hopper), a shadowy American. Zimmermann insults him, knowing Ripley is involved in selling art forgeries in Germany. In retaliation, Ripley passes Zimmermanns name to Raoul Minot (Gerard Blain), a French mobster seeking a hitman. Minot and Ripley use faked medical tests to convince Zimmermann that hes dying of a rare blood disease, and promise a substantial sum of money for his family when he dies if he agrees to become Minots hitman. He does.

The American Friend works as both thriller and character study. Ripley is an entirely self-serving, cold-hearted crook who uses intimidation and whatever else it takes to get his way. A classic manipulator with an oily charm, he has made a career of deception and dishonesty, winning the confidence of his marks, then homing in for the kill. Ripley is potentially lethal, and anticipating what he will do next comprises the major suspense element of the film.

Ganz is especially effective as a man involuntarily enmeshed in a situation he cannot control. This is familiar Hitchcock territory, but Wenders isn't as deft with it. Despite the falsified medical records, Zimmermann seems too willing to commit murder. After all, he is hardly a killer by trade. Once the plot is established, however, several well written scenes between Zimmermann and Ripley establish each mans shaky moral compass.

Bonus extras on the new, restored digital transfer Blu-ray edition include audio commentary from 2002 featuring director Wim Wenders and actor Dennis Hopper; new interview with Wenders; new interview with actor Bruno Ganz; deleted scenes with commentary by Wenders; a trailer; and a critical essay. The film is in English, French, and German, with English subtitles.",1452038400,5,1996,5.270440251572327

It's still a great movie, with excellent performances all around, especially by Bruno Ganz, several decades before Downfall brought him back to the attention of US moviegoers. If this product was just about the movie, I would give it 5 stars without any hesitation.

Sadly, it's not just about the movie :( it's about this DVD version, and unfortunately, that is where it all falls down. The product information will tell you that this movie has subtitles. Unfortunately, this is extremely misleading. People speak many languages in this movie, and yes, the german and the french are indeed subtitled (even when they are perfectly clear even to this very indifferent speaker of french). However, the spoken english is NOT subtitled, despite the fact that the DVD menu actually identifies the subtitles as ""english."" Dennis Hopper is an awesome actor, but ahem, sometimes, he mumbles, and I found whole sections of the english dialogue practically incomprehensible for lack of subtitles :( If you are like me and prefer to watch any movie with subtitles, please be aware that the english dialogue in this version is absolutely devoid of subtitles, despite being advertised as subtitled.",1337904000,10,1303,4.977064220183486
1785016,5,B00006LPC6,"This is not a film of Highsmith's book,Ripley's Game,for that you need to go to the later version with Malkovitch as Ripley. This is inspired by that book,creating it's atmosphere and characterisation with a shift into the central consciousness of professional framemaker Jonathan(Bruno Ganz),who is the heart and soul of the film,away from Ripley(Hopper) who merely pulls the strings. This film is predominantly set in Europe,with an American unifying aesthetic. Jonathan has been diagnosed with terminal leukaemia and following a chance encounter with the enigmatic Ripley he finds a way to ensure a stable future for his family. Ganz suggests the internal conflict with his moral beliefs and loving family outlook. He is lured in by the bait Raul Pinot (Blain) offers him :new tests in the American Hospital in Paris by a top specialist. Ripley has been the catalyst for this new adventurous, amoral life,following a slight he receives from Zimmerman. Ripley is a loner cowboy adrift in Hamburg,consumed with existential angst. He is drawn towards Zimmerman's hard-working honesty and warm family home. In an early scene Ripley records his thoughts in a taped diary:""There is nothing to fear but fear itself...I know less and less about who I am or who anybody else is"".Hopper has never been better or more restrained and calm.

There are two marvellous set-pieces set on trains. The first thriller sequence is in a subway station depicting Jonathan's inept murder of an underworld figure. The second set on a moving train where he is joined surprisingly by Ripley, is worthy of Hitchcock. There is a lot of physical force and suspense,the use of garrotting and bodies pushed out of trains. There is a lot of black humour in a scene with tickets. Also there is a homage to American film noir (cf two directors,Ray and Fuller cast as conmen and criminals),also the role of Ripley as a sleazy conman with mob connections. Ripley shows his humanity by wanting to be Jonathan's `American friend'.There is great chemistry between the two leads. What is stressed is everybody's moral ambivalence. The truly interesting expressionist quality of the cinematography,unusual use of colour and lighting,with cityscapes bathed in dark blues and dark greens and a somewhat faded background palette overlaid with strikingly bright and saturated primary colours for particular objects or costumes. There is the influence of Edward Hopper on the framing and camera angles,with Knieper's brooding score to suggest the intensity and danger round every corner of the seedy industrial backlots of Hamburg. There are a lot of motifs centred around picture slides and moving pictures which figure in gift exchange between the `friends' His wife Erica(excellent Kreuzer) is aware Jonathan is not giving her the whole picture:""I don't even want to know what you do with your American friend"".The corruptive influence of American movies is a major theme.

1785017,3,B00006LPC6,"The Bottom Line:

The weakest of the films involving Tom Ripley (though I haven't seen Ripley Under Ground), Wim Wender's slow moving adaptation of Ripley's Game features an impressive performance by Bruno Ganz but Dennis Hopper is mediocre as Ripley himself and during several passages the film slows to a crawl; unless you're determined to see every Ripley film or love the director's work, you'd be better suited to watch the 2002 Ripley's Game instead.

Some of the action and situations remind  of films like ""High Risk""

This film is really not Dennis Hopper's best acting,

The ending is a surprise, but may well be the best part of the film.
There are subway rides to a death, and train rides to a killing,

The story is about an honest man tricked
by bad people into doing what he doesn't really want to do.

1785019,4,B00006LPC6,"`Der Amerikanische Freund' is dark and mysterious and ultimately rewarding, even if at times it is a tad confusing and ambiguous.  Loosely adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel `Ripley's Game', `Der Amerikanische Freund' is a story of suspense and murder.  Patricia Highsmith did for the world of literature what Alfred Hitchcock did for the world of cinema (could be why they made the perfect pairing when Hitchcock adapted Highsmith's masterful novel `Strangers on a Train' for the big-screen) and so it's obvious when watching any adaptation of one of her novels that the viewer is in for a moody and tense piece.  In actuality I have not read any of her Ripley novels so I can't say just how loosely this is adapted, but one thing is for sure; director Wim Wenders definitely understood the mood Highsmith would have wanted to capture.

The film follows a picture framer named Jonathan Zimmermann who is dying of a rare blood disease.  He's panicky about leaving behind his beautiful wife Marianne and his young son Daniel.  When he first meets American Tom Ripley at an art auction he is rude and disgruntled.  He doesn't like Ripley's character.  The film shifts gears when Jonathan is approached by Raoul Minot, a man who needs a favor.  He offers Zimmermann a substantial amount of money if he murders someone for him.  The details are sketchy and even when the credits begin to roll the audience has plenty of questions about what really happened, but the details really become null and void when one focuses on what Wenders wants us to focus on.

The film is a character study more than anything else; a study of desperation and guilt and the ultimate love and loyalty.  Bruno Ganz is marvelous as Jonathan Zimmermann and really brings this man to life.  We see the many stages of his emotional breakdown; his confidence diminishes to fear and paranoia until he finally loses it.  Ganz is an actor I really want to see more of.  I remember back a few years when I saw him chew up the screen as Adolf Hitler in `Der Untergang' and I immediately wanted to research his catalogue of films but until recently hadn't got around to it.  After watching his intense performance here though I will make an even more constructive effort to get my hands on more Ganz.

Dennis Hopper stars as Tom Ripley, and it is here that I am left a tad unimpressed.  Like I mentioned, I have not read any of Highsmith's `Ripley' novels.  I have read a few of her other novels and have been meaning to get my hands on the Ripley's but I just have not had the time.  So because of that I cannot tell who does a better job of fleshing out Ripley, Hopper or Matt Damon.  What I can say though is that the two actors paint completely different characters.  In my personal opinion, Damon triumphs effortlessly.  What I appreciated about Damon was that he created a character that was cunning and manipulative but was drenched in self-loathing and insecurities; so much so that he came across as likable and sympathetic, thus adding to his mysterious draw on the people around him.  Hopper plays Ripley like a cold hearted psychopath.  It's apparent from the moment he steps on the screen that he is gruff and cold.  Thankfully this film focuses on Zimmermann and thus Hopper is really not on the screen all that much.

In the end I recommend `Der Amerikanische Freund'.  It is a strong study of human nature and it creates a mood of suspense even when nothing suspenseful is taking place.  The subway murder scene alone is a perfect example of flawless filmmaking, a scene that is slow and brooding and steals the audience's heartbeats one by one.  The film is not as polished or as masterfully constructed as `The Talented Mr. Ripley' but it delivers the goods regardless.  While the ending is a tad over-the-top and a little confusing I still felt rewarded after turning the film off.  Don't expect to understand everything right off the bat, and there are some facets of the plot that you may never fully understand (I guess it's time to read that novel) but Wenders and company create a satisfying thriller that gets under your skin and into your head.",1208995200,2,4138,4.672651933701657
1785020,4,B00006LPC6,"Here we have yet another adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel. Made in the 1970's this German version was directed by Wim Wenders. Dennis Hopper is the American friend although the movie pretty much belongs to Bruno Ganz who plays the quiet picture framer Jonathan Zimmerman with a blood disease. Hopper convinces him to take out an enemy of a Frenchman Gerard Blain in a Paris subway. Then there is the pivotal scene in a train lavatory where the best laid plans go awry. The film is set in Hamburg, Paris and New York. Hopper in really an engaging and good performance plays Ripley as a crude American who often wears a cowboy hat, a far cry from Matt Damon (""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", John Malkovich (""Ripley's Game"") and Alain Delon (""Purple Noon""), all of whom play the character as an urbane sophisticate (while Damon starts out as a novice to culture, he is certainly a fast learner).

The cinamatography works very well here, giving the viewer atmospheric shots of Hamburg as well as some interesting closeups, for instance, the frames of TV monitors that catch Zimmerman fleeing from the subway after committing the murder.

Highsmith novels continue to engage film directors. Since she has many more novels that have yet to be made into movies, we can only hope other directors take up the Ripley story soon.",1192924800,,1322,4.793859649122807
1785021,4,B00006LPC6,"""The American Friend"" was the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel ""Ripley's Game"", the third book in her Ripley series, written for the screen and directed by Wim Wenders. The film can be viewed simply as neo-noir or as an allegory of the American economic conquest of Europe, which was held in distaste by many authors of New German Cinema. It imparts an unmistakable sense of time -the 1970s- and of its artistic philosophy, but Wenders blurs the distinctions between Hamburg, Paris, and New York by focusing on their industrialism. ""The American Friend"" may be more interesting as political cinema than as a thriller, but it is also more dated. Wenders wittily cast seven directors to play his villains, starting with Dennis Hopper as sociopath Tom Ripley.

Tom Ripley (Dennis Hopper) is an American dealer in counterfeit artwork living in Hamburg, West Germany. His fateful introduction to art restorer Jonathan Zimmerman (Bruno Ganz) at an auction for a forged painting sets a bizarre series of events in motion. Raoul Minot (Gerard Blain), an associate of Ripley's, asks Ripley to settle an old debt by killing a man for him. Ripley is reluctant to do the job himself, so he suggests Zimmerman, who is suffering from a serious blood disease. Minot promises Jonathan 250,000 deutschmarks to kill a man in the Paris subway, insisting that Jonathan has little time to live anyway, and this would allow him to leave his family well cared-for. Jonathan is shocked by the proposition but somehow seduced by it into a violent and chaotic world.

""Ripley's Game"" retained its name in a second movie adaptation in 2002 that aspired only to be a psychological thriller. ""The American Friend"" is more successful than ""Ripley's Game"", but the two films have completely different narrative focus. ""The American Friend"" tends toward character study. It's about Jonathan, portrayed by the superb and meticulous Bruno Ganz as a regular guy whose introversion conceals a morbid angst. Why does Jonathan want to believe that he is dying? Why does he trust a murderous stranger with obvious ulterior motives? Why does he willingly plunge his life into chaos and terror? Those are the questions at the heart of ""The American Friend"". The later film ""Ripley's Game"" marginalized the wiling victim in favor of the more forceful and colorful characters of Tom Ripley and his nefarious acquaintance.

In ""Ripley's Game"", Tom Ripley is an outright sophisticate, played seductively by John Malkovich. Tom Ripley of ""The American Friend"" vacillates strangely and inexplicably between sophisticate and coarse, ugly American. Where ""Ripley's Game"" has sharp, articulate dialogue, ""The American Friend"" has improvisation and eccentric behavior. Though some of his antics are undoubtedly intended as metaphor, Ripley's character is incoherent, making him the weak link in this film. But ""The American Friend"" is much stronger film noir than ""Ripley's Game"", in spite of its freestyle dialogue, because Jonathan Zimmerman is a true noir protagonist, and his plight is this film's focus. In English and German with English subtitles.

The DVD (Anchor Bay 2003): There are 36 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Wim Wenders, a theatrical trailer (3 min), and text bios with selective filmographies for Wim Wenders, Bruno Ganz, and Dennis Hopper. There is a feature commentary by writer/director Wim Wenders and actor Dennis Hopper. Wenders talks about actors, lighting, the cinematography of Robby Muller, locations, some technical details, and the film's reception. Hopper comments on Wender's directing style, and both men recall the spontaneity of the performances and rewrites. They do not discuss characters, story, or themes.

1785049,4,B00006LPC6,"THE AMERICAN FRIEND is a clever film, but one that perhaps suffers from a being a little too smart for its own good. As an exploration of the cultural colonisation of Germany it is very effective, and WIM WENDERS fills the subtext of his film with a pessimistic tone that borders on paranoia, a redolent theme for a film of the 1970's. He depicts a featureless and grey Europe that is bending under the unbearable yolk of capitalism. A continent that has had its originality squeezed out of it by the duplicitous behaviour of people like Tom Ripley.  A land of commerce and greed, rather than art. In fact art becomes the metaphorical device for the insidiousness of a consumer driven society, with both painting and the cinema acting as its agents.  Of all European countries to feel the pinch of forced doctrines by the USA, Germany in the wake of WW2 is perhaps the most notable. A generation of film-makers grew up with an ambivalent attitude towards Hollywood. They were respectful of its efficiency, but  resentful of its corrupt value system and sought to implement their own brand of national cinema. THE AMERICAN FRIEND and to a lesser degree Werner Herzog's STROSZEK are the most indicative examples of these complex tensions. Viewed today the film also becomes an intricate and enjoyable parody of film noir and the values that genre embodied. It's post-modern credentials are worn as a badge, in both Wenders choices of colour, and especially in the casting. As a deconstruction of both Hollywood's influence and the effects of forced capitalism THE AMERICAN FRIEND works tremendously well. Unfortunately the sophistication of its satirical elements, wring a great deal of the life out of the film, especially in terms of excitement and spectacle.",1152921600,4,1759,4.95593220338983
1785050,4,B00006LPC6,"I saw this movie when it was first released on VHS years ago. The reason I rented it was because I was in a big Dennis Hopper phase and trying to watch just about everything he had done. This was during the time of him cleaning up and his resurgence with Blue Velvet and directing Colors. I must say that the movies I watched usually broke down into two categories. The first was the early Hopper portraying the weakling son of the bad man. The other was the very messed up and drug addicted Hopper which had its highlights as he rambled to a great performance in Apocalypse Now but most were really bad movies that were hard to watch. All that said, I must say that Wim Wenders adaptation of Ripleys Game 'American Friend' was a huge suprise and ended up being one of my all time favorites. It also introduced me to the great actor Bruno Ganz. But in this movie Hopper is his equal and they both turn in fascinating performances. Of course this movie was out before The Talented Mr. Ripley with Jude Law and Matt Damon. Since I had never read the books I had nothing to go on. Wim Wenders direction is great and the story is interesting and just keeps you focused. Ganz is great as the German frame maker who owns a little shop and who meets the strange, complex and brilliant shady Tom Ripley (Hopper). Hopper is involved in the criminal underworld. One of his enterprises is the selling of fake art. He tricks Ganz into doing some 'wet work' for his criminal friends by getting him involved in a murder for hire plot because they spin a scheme that has him believe that his physical condition (a blood disease that is controlled)is much worse and that he only has a limited time to live. In time manipulation morphs into a kind of friendship between the two.

I won't go any further because I don't want to spoil the story for anybody who wants to watch. This is a good foreign film but refreshingly is easy to follow and has quite a bit of English dialogue. I believe a good bit of the movie takes place in both Germany and in France (haven't seen it in a long time).

One last funny story about this movie. A girl I was dating rented The Talented Mr. Ripley when it first came out. I watched it and liked it very much. I told the story of a young Tom Ripley and it was excellent. A few years later I picked up another copy of American Friend and viewed it. As I was watching I caught Hoppers characters name, Tom Ripley. I immediately realized that the big hit movie of the day 'The Talented Mr. Ripley's' or at least its main character had been done years before in a brilliant Wim Wenders adaptation 'American Friend'. So I did a google search and found this is an adaptation of the novel 'Ripleys Game'. I guess this movie has been remade recently with John Malkovich as Ripley in the feature film Ripleys Game. Also I understand that the Ripley character has also been done by Alain Delon in one of the earliest adaptions of Ripley.",1140739200,4,2941,4.355191256830601

The violence is cold and chilling and serves as a crucial back up in the believability of the story and characters, with credit for director Wim Wenders who never lost grip.

1785052,4,B00006LPC6,"Wim Wenders always directs top notch films, and this one is no exception.  It is an unusual film noir. It is not in black and white, it takes place in Hamburg in the 1970s, and it lacks some of the typical noirish thrills.  There is, however, much implicit fear in this film, as the main German character, Jonathan Zimmermann is manipulated by rival international groups like a pawn on a chessboard.  Although not an overtly political film, it does (inadvertently or otherwise) reflect the beliefs of some West Germans in the 1970s that their country was dominated, culturally and otherwise, by the United States: the film contrasts the German master craftsman with the American materialist; the ""weak"" West German with the strong, but evil, American.

The original working title of this film was ""Framed,"" a double-entendre which relates both to Zimmermann's work and the manner in which he is set up.  Dennis Hopper gives the performance of his career as the malevolent, paranoid, psychopathic ""American Friend,"" who is set off by Zimmermann's curtness toward him at an art auction.  But his performance is dwarfed by that of Bruno Ganz, who carries the movie as Zimmermann, a man suffering from a blood disease who lacks the ability to swim against the whirlpool of events sucking him ever downward. The contrast of characters moves the plot along, and the harbor city of Hamburg provides unusual, but often dismal, scenery.  This film is well worth watching.",1109635200,2,1462,4.991769547325103
1785053,5,B00006LPC6,"A German frame maker (Ganz) with a fatal blood disease and therefore perhaps little to loose reluctantly takes on the roll of hit man after a chance encounter with an unethical American art dealer (Hopper). The brilliant acting by Dennis Hopper, Bruno Ganz and Gerard Blain on its own makes this a really memorable movie.  Certainly, this is Dennis Hopper at his most edgy, something he does well and in my opinion this is his most outstanding performance ever.  Ganz is convincing as an honest and reasonable man trying to make the most of a bad situation.  Likewise, Blain is a joy to watch in his role as the smooth professional fixer calling the shots.

I'm not sure if the movie could be said to have a ""Hitchcock"" influence, but I would say that those who like Hitchcock may well enjoy this.  It combines mystery, great camera work and a dark film noir plot with a sound track reminiscent of a Hitchcock movie.  The movie also has a black humour to it as Ganz and Hopper bungle their way through the murderous business of doing away with various criminals.  The second train sequence for example is an absolute hoot and you could easily be watching a Tarintino movie.  Overall, this is one of my favourite films and while it is certainly quirky it stands out as being rather unique.",1107043200,2,1288,4.593886462882096
1785054,4,B00006LPC6,"Plunge a character into a world that is unknown and completely foreign to them and watch as their world comes crashing down around their ankles-this is the plot that outlines _The American Friend_ .  Mr. Ripley, played here by Dennis Hopper, is a man who deals with art forgeries and, quite oddly, schemes to involve a stranger named Jonathan Zimmermann (played by Bruno Ganz) in a series of murders.  Things go splendidly until Jonathon starts to unwind.  Despite Zimmermann's hopes to provide for his family, his involvement with Mr. Ripley's associates only leads to the destruction of his family and his way of life.  Slow at times, _The American Friend_ is a film that gains most of its appeal from the richness of the characters.  I was particularly impressed with Bruno Ganz's performance, as he manages to establish a strong character and completely distintegrate throughout the film gradually.  His performance is so strong that one gets the impression that the film was shot in sequence-the continuity is that good.  Dennis Hopper is also strong in his role as the querky Mr. Ripley (a completely different portrayal than the recent Matt Damon rendition), though I was not drawn to his character when opposite of Ganz.  Of course, Hopper's character does not really enter the film in any significant way until he has decided to befriend a man he has already doomed, but I still expected a little more from the young Hopper.

Though slow at times due to the action-film turned character piece (often said to be a thriller with no thrills), _The American Friend_ has more than enough suspense to keep an audience going when it is at its best.  Worth a rent and a second look.",1098576000,,1683,4.832752613240418
1785055,5,B00006LPC6,"It's in many ways not fair to entitle this film as just a film noir.
I state that because , first at all remember. we are talking about of Patricia Highsmith , one of the most gifted minds in the north american literatute. If you analyze all her literaries works, as Strangers on a train,(Hitchcock) or A plenn soleil(Rene Clement), you'll find all the characters are envolved in a cosmical trick. It's true that the hopeless who surrounds establishes an anticipated fate in all their actions. But what Highsmith adds in every work, including the american friend is the lack of any kind of feeling or ethical consideration carried to a level that they become in models. I mean, it's very hard for us to find by instance, with a character as Mr. Rippley in any street of any city in the world. These characters are not common.
That's the most remarkable virtue in Highsmith and Wenders so Clement and Hithcock understood and exploited this item like few.
Wenders,one of the three kings of the german filmography in the seventies, (together with Fassbinder, Herzog, and Hauff), knew how to deal with that and make a clever twist in an age where the key works of the neo film noir, a genre that slowly was left and replaced by thrillers with little trascendence.
This film , in my point of view, made grow up to Dennis Hopper, not only as actor, but as a filmmaker. (Remember his best work as director titled Colors).
This film is eternal. And that means just one thing: it's a masterpiece. And obviously, it will resist the years and far of getting old, it will enrich us, every time we watch it.",1084492800,,1594,4.576923076923077
1785056,4,B00006LPC6,"The American Friend is a particularly trenchant example of Wim Wenders' favorite theme--the outsider in a different culture (cf. The Buena Vista Social Club--Ry Cooder in Havana; Until the End of the World--William Hurt's American character in Europe).  Only in this case, the outsider, Dennis Hopper--the American friend--ruins the life of the insider, played by Bruno Ganz.
But that's what noir is all about.  Based on one of the Ripley novels by American ex-patriate author Patricia Highsmith (no doubt her ex-pat status appealed to Wenders), the film follows Jonathan Zimmermann (Ganz) in his descent into Noirville via Tom Ripley (Hopper) and Ripley's ""partner"" Minot, a sinister French man.  This time out, unlike in the 1960 film Purple Noon (THE best cinematic version of Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley--far better than the recent version with Matt Damon), Ripley is an edgy guy (what else could Hopper be?--especially in 1977 when he was coked to the gills) who deals in art forgeries.
Along the way we meet an artist who does the forgeries, and that's famed director Nicholas Ray in a great role.  Ray is one of Wenders' heroes--maybe his biggest hero--and he's here in his glory--sad single eye partnered with his trademark eyepatch, gaunt face and all.  Three years later, Ray died of cancer.  We also meet a gangster played by another of Wenders' favorite directors, Samuel Fuller.  But Fuller's part is smaller than Ray's, which says something...
This is a perfect exemplar of the road to Hell being paved with good intentions.  Zimmermann's one desire to take care of his family results in his being coerced into dark deeds that ultimately leave Zimmermann emotionally destitute.
Wenders' focus is on the characters who make things happen, who bring about the downfall of both themselves and of others.  While American neo-noirs can occasionally do a great job of focusing on action-driven plots--given a great writer/director team--in this film, Wenders chooses instead to have the story unfold based on personalities.
An unusual and strong neo-noir, The American Friend is a unique film that is a key work in the Wenders oeuvre.  Great job (an American expression).",1070150400,7,2187,5.169971671388102
1785057,5,B00006LPC6,"The first chilling moment in this film is when relatively poor and struggling art framer and cultured European (Swiss) Bruno Ganz is introduced to art dealer American (Dennis Hopper)) Tom Ripley  at an art auction, and refuses to shake his hand.  From that moment, Mr Ganz is more or less doomed.  One theme of this film is the clash between two cultures, or at least two attitudes to art, money versus art, the contempt each has for the other.  Another theme is how thrilling it would be to kill anyone who  makes a fool of us in public.  From the moment  of the slight, the doomed Mr Ganz is slowly brought to his end - the mis en scene becomes a horror show of ordinary things made threatening, seagulls, art frames he works on he starts bumping into, a television set which is off zaps him with static electricity when he touches it, he stumbles in to objects whilst waiting for a train, the doodling on a piano by a ""medical student"" gangster becomes an atonal nightmare.  The moment when Mr Ganz breathes onto the finest piece of gold leaf we can see him realising the breath of life is so precious, but he's losing it and he knows it.
A stunning cinematic experience.  A masterpiece and perhaps the finest transformation of  Ms Highsmith's many Ripley adaptations, notwithstanding Mr Hitchcock.",1066089600,19,1301,4.6173913043478265
1785058,5,B00006LPC6,"Despite the casting of a well-known (some would say, ""infamous"") American actor in the form of Dennis Hopper, Wim Wenders' take on the very American ""film noir"" style in ""The American Friend"" was every bit a fit with the work that came before and after. The same thoughtful approach to character and story that animates Wenders' ""road movies"" is also on display in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel ""Ripley's Game.""
""The American Friend"" draws the viewer into its web with subtle twists, a captivating atmosphere and excellent performances by Dennis Hopper as the mysterious Ripley and Bruno Ganz (later to star in Wenders' ""Wings of Desire"") as the ordinary man who gets caught up in Ripley's web. With its exceptionally careful pacing, the film is certainly not for everyone. For those willing to embrace Wenders' unique approach, however, the end result is a truly gripping film that will stay with you long after some more viscerally thrilling movies have faded from memory.",1037318400,45,990,5.079754601226994
7971529,5,B00006LPC6,"This is not a film treatment of a novel. It's an original film by a first-rate artist that is loosely inspired by the books of a third-rate novelist. It is not about Ripley, it's about Ganz and is far more complex than anything Patricia Highsmith ever wrote. Though his wife does not have much screen-time, the center of the film is their relationship: Ganz knows he's going to die because he can feel it, the doctors are irrelevant. He knows he is being used, but he's using them to get money to leave his wife when he's gone. Hopper thinks he has a friendship (platonic, though Hopper is homosexual) with Ganz, but Ganz only cares about his wife, as is clear in the end. And that barely scratches the surface, you have to watch a couple of times or more before you catch it all. If you watch it as a Wim Wenders film, without trying to fit it into preconceptions based on the Ripley series, you will appreciate it. If you want a Ripley movie, watch the John Malkovitch version (""Ripley's Game"", I think).",1515628800,,1006,4.443243243243243
