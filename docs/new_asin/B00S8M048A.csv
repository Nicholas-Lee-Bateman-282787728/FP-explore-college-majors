6964623,2,B00S8M048A,"I really wanted to like this film.  The visuals were wonderful, the acting was good, considering what the actors had to work with which wasn't very much.  I'm all for silences in a film, but they should mean something and drive the story forward.  In this film I am sad to say the silences seemed to be there because the script was woefully lacking. The silences were long and drawn out and when they ended what took place didn't do much to move the story forward.  There were gaps  in time which weren't explained. We jump from Donato saving Kondrad to them being in Germany apparently with Donato on vacation.  He then decides to stay in Germany with Konrad even though he has no job and no prospects. Then we jump once again and it is apparently years later Donato's brother has come to look for him and we are given no indication what has gone on in the mean time.  We come to find out that Donato never contacted his family again, that he and Konrad have broken up and have been for some time.  There were just too many jumps in time that weren't explained, too many silences that went nowhere and the ending while beautifully shot, meant nothing. It told the viewer nothing and in the end was like one of those silences that peppered this film, long, drawn out and boring.  I give it two stars only because it was beautifully shot, and the acting such as it was given the lack of material to go on was good.",1433376000,7,1413,4.342205323193916
6964624,1,B00S8M048A,"Pretentious, style without content.
This very small movie has an artsy pretense, but there is no content. How a boyfriend of a German biker drowned, then without any explanation
falls in love with a Brazilian beach guard with no rhyme or reason. The rest of the movie has no rhyme or reason either.. Divided into 3 episodes in which all the ""momentous"" changes with the Brazilian moving with the German to Berlin, There relationship is without content, there is a break up with no reasoning provided. The Brazilian having left his mother (whom he doesn't visit even for her funeral), a younger brother who adulates him but he left him too. There are VERY long sequences with no content either. Very, very bad",1432166400,10,708,4.764227642276423
6964625,1,B00S8M048A,"Very slow.  Well acted, but with a very poorly explained ending.  I can't say that I would recomend this.",1431907200,,105,4.473684210526316
6964626,3,B00S8M048A,Great visuals but the story was a little haphazard for me...I didn't understand how the attraction between the two men occurred or how the main character was able to stay away from home for so long...it wasn't clear to me what he was running away from.,1431907200,3,252,4.5

6964628,5,B00S8M048A,slightly slow in pace initially but the main character's struggle is very well portrayed through the chapters. Thoroughly recommend this film,1431388800,4,141,5.761904761904762
6964629,4,B00S8M048A,Interesting flick.,1431388800,,18,8.5
6964630,3,B00S8M048A,"I  have to give this film a 2.5.  The acting is good (as far as  the script goes); but I could  not for the life of me see any character motivation, and the last of three parts was directionless.",1431388800,,195,3.923076923076923
6964631,5,B00S8M048A,"The film is marketed here as a romance, and at its heart it is, but this is not a fluffy romp. The film asks some challenging and surprising questions. What happens when something unexpected changes your life forever? What happens to those who are left behind? Set in So Paulo and (mostly) Berlin, the story is comprised of three separate parts that weave together easily yet offer no easy answers. The acting is excellent and the cinematography is beautiful throughout. I was struck by the almost total absence of typical ""gay romance"" tropes, and this is one of the film's strengths and also the source of its biggest weakness. I struggled to believe in the initial attraction because much of it appears to have developed off screen. Once the film shifts to Germany and difficult choices are confronted the film comes into its own.

I have one caveat. The pacing can be glacial, even by European standards, but the reward is an unusually lovely and thoughtful film. The ending is so well done I felt like applauding.",1431129600,6,1018,4.751412429378531
6964632,3,B00S8M048A,"The storyline makes no sense and jumps around, doesnt explain much.  I turned it off after 45 minutes, wasn't worth my time.",1442448000,,124,4.636363636363637
6964633,3,B00S8M048A,I loved the first 2 chapters of the movie.  The last chapter left me feeling sad.,1442275200,,81,4.0625
6964634,2,B00S8M048A,"Seemed so ""typical"".  I was expecting more from this
foreign film.  Unfortunately, when it ended, there seemed
to be no answers???",1441584000,,130,5.142857142857143
6964635,4,B00S8M048A,"Nothing could be more introspective than this brazilian/german film, with little plot and a lot of propositions. The story centers on a safeguard attracted to one of the man he saves. They soon go for sex, softly depicted in the movie. Next they go to Germany, in a process of inner evolution for the brazilian character that may be difficult for the appetite of American audiences, little is spoken. A Brazilian like me does understand it better, for its a dilemma most common for a man divided between its original family and a life he thinks ought to be better.
The principals are the continuum of the film, both handsome, specially the well-built safeguard. It was already discussed that the word love is not part of the plot. Not a single time it is mentioned they could experiment this sentiment to one another, and one will really have to speculate  which were the inner movements that made the brazilian immigrate. Not an easy film, but I think it worth the effort.
A trivia: in Brazil, where Wagner Moura is well known and the film went to commercial circuit, it was a scandal the sex sequences. So much so that audiences where advertised in the tickets about the subject.",1441584000,3,1181,4.677884615384615
6964636,4,B00S8M048A,"Donato (Wagner Moura -`Elite Squad') is a lifeguard at `Praia do futuro' and gets called into action one day when two German tourists get into trouble in the turbulent surf. Donato is unable to save him but afterwards meets Konrad - this is the friend of the drowned man and he is gay - just like Donato.

Well one thing leads to another and they get romantically entwined. It is a relationship built on lust and though that can survive for a while it always seems doomed to failure. Whilst the inevitable catches up on the love front, Donato seems to have also, not run, but ambled away from his past and family. That is a past with a memory and it is just as inevitable that it too will catch up with him.

Now this is a very well made and observed film, with some stunning scenes and a confidence to know when to ramp up the ante and when to let it meander by in a pique of self absorption. There is a smattering of bedroom action, but simulated and nothing over the top. This is a relationship piece more than anything else and covers most of the bases. It has a full range of emotions too and reactions but approaches its subject from the view that there is essentially good in all of us. This is a film for those who want to be made to think and if that floats your boat then I think you will get a lot from this film.",1440633600,4,1324,4.147859922178989

6964640,3,B00S8M048A,"I can't say anything really good or really bad about this movie. There's just not much going on. The picture, sound, subtitles, and acting are all OK but the story is really shallow. Minimal skin and softcore.",1434585600,,209,4.675675675675675

8697671,2,B00S8M048A,Donato (Wagner Moura) works as a lifeguard at the spectacular but treacherous Praia do Futuro beach in Brazil; Konrad (Clemens Schick) is an ex-military thrill-seeker from Germany vacationing with a friend when they both dive into Futuro beach and get in trouble Konrad is rescued while his friend is not. This movie is for some reason broken down into 3 parts and as for me the only part that held any real story was the third part. I really felt like there were parts left out whether it was in the relationship between Donato and Konrad or later Donato and the young brother he left behind in Brazil many years earlier. Even as I liked the 3rd part best it was still mind numbingly dull. I got nothing from the characters and nothing from the story either. I would not recommend this dull passage but somehow I think it could have been better.,1484611200,,846,4.5359477124183005

8697673,3,B00S8M048A,"The biggest issue I have with the film is the subtitles.  I believe there should be a standard applied to all foreign films released here in the U.S.  I've seen the color dark yellow (gold) used for subtitles and found that to be the best for any and all films.  White subtitles are completely washed out if there are any scenes show using a white background.  Sorry, but I want to be able to read the dialogue.  And once again, the dialogue font is too small for home viewing and changes far too quickly unless you are a speed reader.  Sadly, I am not one.  The acting is fine, the settings are good, and for those here in the U.S. who want something fresh and not a stereotype gay themed film, purchasing this movie is a step in the right direction.",1469923200,2,751,4.283687943262412

8697675,4,B00S8M048A,"I am puzzled by all of the negative reviews of this film. I thought the acting very good,the plot( in 3 parts) purposeful to the intent of the movie-maker. Yes,the pacing was slow,but the end result was a moving account of people coming to terms with love,loss & insecurities. This was a film--not a cheap rental. I was very moved by the deliberate settings,accompanying music & would recommend it highly.

More of a mediation on stillness and not a film about any living thing's experience.  A yoga class would be time and money better spent.",1447113600,,304,4.206896551724138

8697679,4,B00S8M048A,"This is one of those films thatwhen you read the story synopsissounds like it will be utter sentimental tripe, lousy with clich-ridden dialog.

This film is anything but.

This is one of the best gay male-themed films I've seen in a long time. I'd put it right up there with Weekend in quality, but the two films couldn't be more different. Weekend is dialog-driven, Futuro Beach is not. There are long spans where nobody says much of anything; you just observe.

In the beginning, the story doesn't seem like it of holds a lot of promise.

But just wait. When this film shifts gears, it really shifts gears. It's impossible to predict where it's going next, always a sure sign of a good movie, IMO.

While the dialog is sparse and unsentimental, there is emotion all around. The men may be terse with each other, but they're expressive. We don't know if they're in love. That's how unsentimental this movie is. The words ""I love you"" are never going to be spoken in this modern relationship. What we do know is that there is a dynamic between them that neither wants to abandon.

The themes of this movie are big: life (truly living) and death (just existing). So you might be tempted to assign life-message metaphors to the locale and action. Don't. Just let the film wash over you. This is one of those rare movies that immerses you in its own universe, and by doing so, gives you some insight into your own.",1444953600,3,1411,4.535433070866142
