5825185,1,B00DKD0PUE,"The tittle is not at all fitting. The word ""THE"" implies singularity, and it hardly deserves it.

A bunch of talking heads belonging to teachers of the course and a puppet. Nothing particularly insightful if you have studied the course.

If you know the course I would skip it. Watch the 80's documentary ""The Story of A Course in Miracles"".",1413417600,4,341,4.666666666666667
5825186,2,B00DKD0PUE,"Interesting topic; not well presented.  It's difficult to follow.  Perhaps, it's my preference; audio can't replace written.",1412380800,3,124,6.235294117647059
5825187,1,B00DKD0PUE,I didn't like what I saw of it.  Boring. Big yawn!,1410307200,2,50,3.5454545454545454

If anyone wants the TRUTH.. this is the Fim to have !... many books, DVD's, tapes,...will Give you a 'Feel- Good' reflection of A- Course-In Miracles, BUT,..' this film' will give you the UN- Varnished, CLEAR,.. revelation of what the student is required to know. If you really wish to obtain the GOD Created- knowledge.. you are created to have... please get this FILM/ DVD.
{** MY copy of the DVD .. had sections'' missing'' the Sound tract.. you could see the person talking , but 'no' sound. must be a problem with the ** manufacturing of the DVD..? even with inperfection in the sound,.. the content is brilliant and outstanding }",1384473600,18,707,4.664

5825191,2,B00DKD0PUE,"It sounds pretty ""hokey"" to me and does not fit into the typical ""life after death"" movie, or research that I have done. It does not fit into my own limited extraordinary spiritual experiences in the past.",1440374400,2,205,4.5675675675675675

5825194,5,B00DKD0PUE,Very insightful and inspiring. Wonderfully done and it really honors the message of A Course in Miracles.,1427155200,3,105,5.235294117647059

5825197,1,B00DKD0PUE,"This seemed like an hour long commercial for the ""Course in Miracles."" I fast forwarded through much of it, then gave up and turned it off. It deals primarily with relationships, which is not at all what I expected or wanted.",1421280000,3,225,4.512195121951219

8594115,5,B00DKD0PUE,"I'd heard of A Course in Miracles for about a year, then I started subscribing to their emails.  This video took it took a whole new level.  While I continue to research this program and those behind it, I must say what they teach about how we get ourselves ""into trouble' is spot on. The Ego is at the center of our driving force and some serious mistakes.
Having that as a start just isn't enough to tell you what makes this so engaging.
If you want to learn a little more you can find many videos on YouTube.  But I wanted the full story on one DVD.  This was it! But there is still much more to learn.  I've never heard of this view before and now, I can't stop thinking about it.",1520467200,,684,4.074626865671642
8594116,1,B00DKD0PUE,This misses the mark considerably!  It translates some of the teachings into new words that aren't the message intended at all.  The quality is weak and I cant recommend this to anyone.  In fact...it gives a negative and cultish appearance to the CIM material.,1519344000,,260,4.863636363636363
8594117,5,B00DKD0PUE,Loved it!  Nice to see that others know what it is really about....,1493596800,,67,4.153846153846154

8594121,3,B00DKD0PUE,I found the movie ok as one really has to read the book and the workbook and study it to understand it.,1464048000,2,103,3.727272727272727
8594122,1,B00DKD0PUE,"I LOVE A Course In Miracles (the book and teachings) but find this moving an incredibly dry and uninspiring attempt explain those teachings.  I'm sure it's getting much higher ratings by others because of the underlying message rather than the inherent quality, or lack of quality, of this movie.
A Course In Miracles, the teachings:  Five stars.  A Course In Miracles, the movie:  One lone star....",1462579200,,399,5.0
