8681477,4,B00745HDBI,"A French-speaking actress of Portuguese origin,Julie, has come to Lisbon to make a film about a 17th century Portuguese nun who is seduced by a Naval Officer. While waiting she walks around Lisbon, bumping into a boy,Vasco, and an impoverished aristocrat,Henrique,who she meets at a restaurant. He meets her again and confesses she has prevented him from committing suicide. Vasco is on the street and not at school and this makes her curious to meet his mother. His real mother committed suicide and a family friend,Madalena,decided to look after him,but she already has 3 children and has to earn a living. She's thinking of getting him adopted. At a disco Julie tells a young man she believes him to be the reincarnation of the 16th century Portuguese king D.Sebastio,but ducks his advances with the promise of 3rd time lucky,if they meet again, he will be the love of her life.

On her walk around Lisbon Julie goes to a chapel where she sees a nun in prayer. She later has a significant dialogue with the nun about love and the way she seemed to mirror the life of the nun,and how being true to oneself made one truly alive. The film is shot with each person speaking directly into the camera as if the camera is the person they are speaking to. This is a slow,contemplative film which avoids speed or crowd scenes, although they a show people in a kind of disco dancing;or the camera crew are shown setting up a scene. Also Julie is seen getting a ride on a tram. But mainly the film concentrates on the walks of Julie. She sees her co-star ,Martin,off-camera,he is married but his relationship has lost its spark and so they agree to have sex and see each other when they get back to Paris. Julie attempts to call Paris where she knows a couple who may adopt him. However she is unable to contact them. She returns to the neighbour and discusses the idea of the boy returning with her to Paris for a holiday and her desire to adopt him,to everybody's agreement. This decision has been influenced by her talk with the nun. The film gives a sensory, ambulant view of the streets of Lisbon and the interiors of chapels or cafes by day and by night. There is a superb musical group playing fado music in one of the cafes,who play out a few numbers,which are very moving.

Leonor Baldaque(Julie) has the strange stare of a seeker after spiritual truth,with an empathy that draws in the lost souls she meets. We get the sense of pilgrimage from seeing a worm's eye view of people's feet walking to and fro. You get the sense from Eugene Green that to go into the future you need to go back to the past through a sense of parallel lives,plural identities, bilinguality. There is the idea that through falsity you can express the truth as Julie tells the nun she does in acting. Cinema can release hidden spiritual energy in material things, pluck out the spiritual from the ordinary. The nun's role is played with an extraordinary scene-stealing intensity.",1387843200,,2956,4.6072106261859584
