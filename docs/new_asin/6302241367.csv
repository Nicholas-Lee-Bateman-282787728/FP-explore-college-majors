7823033,3,6302241367,"A successful boutique owner comes home early to surprise boyfriend during their one year anniversary and finds him with company: a young blond. His excuse? All she does is work. What does she do in her defense? Head off to Paris, not for a vacation, but for work. At the airport she is literally run over by an attractive but clumsy photographer who ends up sitting next to her in first class on the long flight from Melbourne to Paris. Being immediately attracted to her (surprise!), he relentlessly attempts to make conversation but his overtures are all met with cold disinterest and a bitchy attitude. Fortunately for him, resistance pays off and he gets a dinner date. He whittles away at her workaholicism and they have a romantic evening that doesn't end up with sex. ""Don't come up, I'll call you."" And she does! The requisite conflict will now be presented, but fortunately, it is handled realistically. An entertaining romantic yarn that, for the most part, avoids the schmaltz of so many films in this class. Both leads play their roles convincingly, and Barbara Parkins is easy on the eyes. All and all a pleasant 90 minutes in the ""city of romance.""",1139356800,4,1162,4.757425742574258
