1752583,4,B00006G8I8,"This sublime little gem from the one and only Roger Corman is a fun and cheesy way to spend 62 minutes of your life. After being launched into space via the magic of some of the lamest animation you will ever see, pilot John Corcoran loses control of his spacecraft and plummets to earth. For crashing at such high speed the spaceship is in remarkably good shape. NASA dispatches their one Jeep to the crash site and arrives within minutes. (Note: it is inadvisable to smoke cigarettes at an aircraft accident site.) John has one cut, but is dead, (evidently) although there is a lot of medical doubletalk about his skin color, so they whisk him to the base in the official NASA flatbed truck for examination.
Once back at the base John comes back to life with no warning. They draw a blood sample and see a hysterical piece of animation of one cell, oh sorry, 'alien amorphic cell structure', gobbling up another in the microscope. They decide they best put John in front of a fluoroscope to look inside him, and, (oh the humanity!) he is revealed to be teeming with what appear to be Sea Monkey embryos. John rapidly realizes that the thing that has been terrorizing the base since the crash is a Blood Beast from a different planet, and he is carrying its spawn. Surprisingly, he ends up leading the pro-monster lobby, and decides to reason with the Blood Beast. We actually get to see the felonious (murder and kidnapping) Blood Beast quite a bit (and his amusing shadow a couple of times, too.) It is normally good to get a lot of screen time for the monster in one of these movies, but here, I am not so sure it was that great of an idea, especially in daylight: the Blood Beast looks like a cross between something from 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters' and a giant puffin with beak, claws, zipper, and very bad complexion. In short, the Blood Beast is a little less than horrifying. Ultimately the movie evokes a bit of 'It Conquered the World' or 'Zontar, the Thing From Venus' in the dramatic ending.
Throughout the movie there is dreadful acting (especially the women, for some reason), and great gothic music, which has been recycled from earlier Corman films. This movie was given the MST3K treatment to good effect, and I wish that version was available on DVD as well. Even without the MST3K treatment, this movie is fun to watch and makes you wish that they still made monster movies like this one. Thanks, Roger!",1084924800,4,2426,4.56651376146789
1752584,2,B00006G8I8,"Co-written and produced by Gene Corman, with Roger Corman as the executive producer, Night of the Blood Beast (1958) is a good representation of the Z grade science fiction movies of the late 50's.
Directed by Bernard L. Kowalski, who also helmed Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959), the movie stars, among others, John Baer, Angela Greene, and Ed Nelson, from Teenage Caveman (1958), The Brain Eaters (1959), and TV's Peyton Place (1964).
The movie starts off proper with an astronaut in a small capsule supposedly returning to Earth after a brief orbit.  Something goes wrong, and after much techno babble, ""The negative, cross-indexed hyper dyne ion chamber is reading 8 million psi!"", ""The multi-functional thyroid chronometer is unfunctional!"", the small capsule crashes to Earth.  Two individuals find the capsule (not much of a rescue party) and discover their space-traveling colleague is no longing among the living.  They radio the rest of their small group, who soon arrive, and then they document everything and take the body back to some dinky, remote radar station they are using for a base.  What they don't realize is that their chum didn't come back from space alone...oooooh...(cue creepy music)
A cursory analysis of the dead man reveals he is dead, but he isn't.  The older scientist keeps saying, ""That's impossible"" every time they find another indication that the dead man may not really be dead.  Soon after stuff starts happening...the radio goes kaput, the lights no longer light, vehicles no longer run...seems a magnetic field is playing havoc with just about everything.  And to top things off, there's a space thingy running around, which makes it's appearance known by breaking some windows.  The dead man comes back to life, and we find out a rather disturbing fact in that the man, who was once dead and is now seemingly alive, has wee, little aliens growing inside his body.  Oh yes, the man with the alien babies also develops some kind of telepathic link with the alien, who is now hiding out in one of Hollywood's more famously filmed spots, the Bronson Caves, used for, among other things, the scenes from the 60's Batman TV show where the Batmobile came barreling out whenever the characters left the Batcave.
So what happens next?  Realizing that their friend and colleague's survival is linked to the alien, do they make nicey nice with the alien?  Or do they destroy the abomination?  And what about those alien babies?  Is a satisfactory conclusion forthcoming?  Watch and find out.  (Don't hold your breath)
I have to say, I thought the element of the man carrying aliens inside him was interesting, and the subsequent story, although a bit talky, kept me interested.  The biggest thing working against this movie was the budget.  The space creature was completely funky, looking like giant, sickly sloth with google eyes wearing dirty trash bags.  This may have been better received at the time, but now seems like a dusty relic.  The movie certainly doesn't hold up to others of the time, but is worth checking out if you enjoy clunky, cheaply made science fiction films of the 50's.  The dialogue, as I said, got rather clunky, but the direction seemed to movie things along pretty well, along with a 65 minute running time.  Short and sweet, that's the way to make a movie like this.  I was just really happy they didn't try to pad things out with a lot of stock footage, as was a common practice with a lot of these low budget features.
The picture quality of the movie on this disc is not all that great, being washed out and showing many flaws and lacking clarity and the audio drops out briefly a couple of times, but I guess that is to be expected.  I am not too familiar with Retromedia and their other releases, so I don't know if they try to use the best possible prints or whatever they have on hand.  This release seems shoddy, especially for the asking price.  The only extra feature is a really poor copy of the trailer for the movie.  There is a nice, lengthy piece on the back of the case about the movie, written by someone from a book I never heard of...

1752585,4,B00006G8I8,"Roger Corman does it again! Night Of The Blood Beast is a gooey cheese classic! An astronaut returns to earth, only to crash and burn. Scientists find him dead, yet still warm and without rigor mortis. They take him back to a research station, where a strange beast appears and kills one of them. The dead astronaut ""wakes up"" and starts acting weird. He is somehow linked to the monster and tells everyone that it means no harm (even though it's already murdered one of 'em). The astronaut decides he needs an x-ray and everyone sees that his body is plum full of alien embryos! The good news is that we do get to see the blood beast itself quite a bit. The bad news is that it looks pretty stupid. The beast tries to tell everyone that it is only here to help us by killing us all and melding our minds with it's own. So, the scientists burn it up in a cave. Will more blood beasts attack in the future? We are left to ponder this deep question. Still, as B movies go, this is at the top of the heap! The musical score is the same as in ""Attack Of The Giant Leeches"" and ""Beast From Haunted Cave"". Corman was a good recycler! Best when viewed after 2 am...",1061683200,14,1158,4.197309417040358

Despite all that negativity I liked this movie for the same reason I like the two I mentioned above, it's fun to watch.

1752587,3,B00006G8I8,"NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST
Is the Ventura release listed here the same as [another] version reviewed by everyone at this site?...
NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST is an enjoyable but cheap and somewhat predictable fare.  The actors do the best they can with the material.  Some elements are reminescent of other films.  The Quatermass Xperiment, for instance, also features an astronaut who comes back to earth, a man who should be dead, but who is kept alive and consumed by an alien parasite.  This film has the ""momma"" or ""papa"" alien aboard the rocket as well.  It will become the protagonist of the film.
The body scan of the astronaut, Major John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) with the incubating alien parasites in his chest cavity is rather cool.  Dr. Wyman (Tyler McVey) has his head bitten off but we are spared the gore.  (Did it originslly show more?)  We find out later that the alien has appropriated the dead doctor's knowledge and language.  Didn't Corman already do this bisiness in ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS?
This film is hardly a Roger Corman classic.  Esentially he assisted his brother who directed this film and the BEAST WITH A MILLION EYES.  The script is poor and steals profusely from others.  The monstrous alien is fashioned from a recycled costume used in TEENAGE CAVEMAN.
The sets are essentially Griffith Park (plenty of fences) and Bronson Caves (seen in lots of movies!).
...  What became of the 35 mm original?  Is it lost?  It is sad if this is the best copy anyone could find.  Many films have been lost through careless circulation.
The notes on the box are quoted from LAST GASPS:  HORRIBLE HORRORS FROM HORROR HEROES by Thorn Sherman.  However, I wish you luck trying to find it...!
The notes close with another peculiar statement,  that the ""lucky film fan ... finally has a chance to see it in the format in which it was meant to be seen in its COMPLETE, TRUNCATED form.""  Huh?  Are they still pulling our chain?  For anyone with poor vocabulary, ""truncated"" means edited or shortened.  How can such a thing be complete?  The notes are a bit insulting.
Even the trailer is abruptly cut off at the end.  The picture quality is poor and the audio is fair.

1752588,3,B00006G8I8,"Great example of classic 50's American drive-in monster movies, of which I am a huge fan. Nobody expected realism, fine plot points or continuity then. People expected fun and still had the ability to suspend their disbelief. Standard wooden but serviceable acting. A couple of actually suspenseful and starling scenes, but pretty lightweight amusement overall. Glad this one came on the market as it had been considered basically lost for years. Get it while you can. It is not the finest example of this genre and era, but is better than a lot, and at just around an hour, it goes down like a candy bar. Hilarious non-ending.
The disc looks as good as one can expect, one of the better looking discs from Retromedia, and no annoying intro. There are a couple of scenes that seem to jump as if some footage is missing, but we can't blame the company for that. At 45 years old, this is as good as it's going to get, and for what it is, what more do you want? A double disc pristine Criterion treatment? Roll out the popcorn and soda and forget your troubles.",1046217600,,1058,4.515625
1752589,4,B00006G8I8,"This is a fun AIP 50's Sci-Fi film!  Perhaps a little more low budget than some AIP pictures as the spaceship is poorly animated and the title creature is the reused spaceman suit from Teenage Caveman.  However, the plot is interesting and there are some well done suspense scenes.
Plot concerns a scientist who crashes on his way back from a space flight.  When he is found, he appears dead but no rigor mortis has set in.  What everyone does not know is that he was not alone on the ship.  He revives just after the stowaway rips the head off one of the good-guy scientists.  Once revived, he finds that he is carrying the offspring of the alien stowaway.
Film is quick-paced (around 60 minutes) and entertaining.  Not a classic, but well worth watching.  This DVD from Retromedia is much better than the others I own (Bride and the Beast, Mad Monster, Teenage Zombies), but is still a far cry from ones put out by Image Entertainment. There are some scratches and occasional (albeit rare) sound splices.  No extras on this DVD.  Nice title to have and I doubt other companies will release so I recommend it.",1036281600,10,1110,4.5606060606060606
1752590,3,B00006G8I8,"This is a low budget sci-fi horror movie about an astronaut who returns to earth dead in his ship. The scientists at the space center put him in the cooler and begin investigating what happened. Then he suddenly returns to life and is found to have alien embryos in his body. Then the alien itself turns up---a big ugly walking critter that feeds on blood. The acting is very bland, the action is also bland with a couple of good jolts. BUT there is a pretty actress playing the crew's photographer named Georgianne Carter who is surprisingly contemporary looking. She's wasted here because most of the female acting duties go to the older female scientist played by Angela Greene who has no business even being in this movie. She's sexless and dull. Had Miss Carter been given the plum female role this would have been a better movie. Not at all bad as a relic of 50's sci-fi, it just could have been better. Curiously, the DVD has been a no-show in Houston. For a monster movie it's worth checking out.",1036022400,2,1004,4.552486187845304
7968148,4,B00006G8I8,"Another so-bad-it's-good that's not that bad Roger Corman sci-fi from 1958.  An experimental rocket with an astronaut inside crash-lands from the outer atmosphere.  It appears our astro-guy is dead but he still has blood pressure?  Go figure that anomaly.  Meanwhile our land crew is stuck in a research facility in the middle of nowhere, miles away from civilization.  It also appears that something came back hidden in the rocket and is attacking the crew in the dark and offing the lead scientist, lobbing part of his head off.  While all this is going on our astronaut comes back to life, frightening the bejabbers out of the women.  When examined it turns out the guy is preggers, carrying alien embryos and it's the mysterious creature running around in the night who's the daddy.  The expectant guy then verbally defends the creature to his fellow humans and it becomes a race to prevent the takeover of Earth and a humane way to end this guy's pregnancy.  Sheeesh.  I have the Retromedia DVD version and it's good quality, but I've read somewhere that the Alpha Video DVD may be better quality.  Whichever is better, the film still could use re-mastering.  Highly recommended for fans of this genre.",1526169600,,1207,4.862745098039215
7968149,4,B00006G8I8,"Night of the Blood Beast: In this 50s sci-fi Roger Corman quickie a returning astronaut (Michael Emmet) crash lands in the hills outside of Cape Canaveral and is discovered by a rescuer (Ed Nelson) and his photographer (Georgianna Carter).

The astronaut appears dead and they bring him back to base camp/shack. After a more thorough examination, it turns out he isn't dead after all, but pregnant with what appears to be six sea monkeys. Then the father shows up (An Owlbear) who is an alien that may or may not have peaceful intentions.

Is the Alien really peaceful? Will the astronauts fiancee (Angela Greene) still go through with their wedding now that he is no longer pure? Who decapitated and ate the brains of the doctor (Tyler McVey)?

The Good: For a quickie Sci-Fi film this has some pretty good mind-bending adult themes. For starters we have a man becoming pregnant by an alien creature and he defends this creature as a teenage girl would defend a delinquent to her parents. The alien talks in quiet tones and proper English about family and immigration as he makes the case for him and the astronaut to raise the babies on their own. We have the hot-headed men who want to kill them just for being different ( The rescuer above and John Baer). The fiancee is conflicted, happy to have her man back but feeling he has changed and is no longer the alpha male she was going to marry.

I would be remiss to not mention Georgianna Carter. She is beautiful yes, actually quite stunning, but that is not unusual in fifties sci-fi. She has a more out of time quality. Have you ever seen those shows that purport to show a woman using a cell phone in a silent film from the twenties or a photo of a modern traveler during the construction of the Panama Canal? With her hairstyle and mannerisms and even dress, she seems to be from at least two decades in the future. You just don't expect a character in s fifties Sci-fi quickie to have Rachel Hair.

I know it gets a lot of flack but I like the alien's Owlbear costume. I had to smile every time it showed up.

The Bad: Night of the Blood Beast is a low budget quickie. Its barely an hour long, the spaceship is a septic tank and there are six people in the entire film.

In Conclusion: A somewhat well written (not shot mind you) sci-fi story that muddies the water of whether aliens are good or evil and bluntly muddies the water on a lot of gender roles as well. Clearly grading on a curve for a Roger Corman quickie, the film has a fun monster, a beautiful woman from the 90s and doesnt overstay its welcome.",1522454400,,2570,4.432203389830509

7968151,5,B00006G8I8,"They don't make them like this anymore.  I'd call it a sad morality tale; an astronaut is impregnated by a creature from outer space while being in outer space.  This astronaut (Michael Emmet) then crashes on reentry to Earth.  He's dead, he's not dead, he's very protective of the critters within and one BIG critter from without who roams hither and yon causing no end of consternation among this small group of technicians cut off from humanity.  Their radio doesn't work.  The power fails.  They're trapped like rats.  Oh the agony when they discover their fearless leader, scientist Wyman (Tyler McVey), hanging from the rafters........and he's not all there!

First of all, the artwork on the DVD case is severely misleading.  The alien in question is not a head hunter nor is he after babes of any sort (although he does grab one at one point, his motives were of the purest nature.  He only wanted a hostage).

Lovingly made by the Corman brothers in a week, on a budget of $68,000.  (Can't imagine what they spent on the FX and alien costume, which was also used in Teenage Cave Man.  Waste not want not.)

Everything about this production is cheap.  But it's fun and stupid.  I've always found it amusing.  And nostalgic.  Had to have it for my collection, cheap.",1424304000,,1273,4.683257918552036
7968152,3,B00006G8I8,"Produced by Roger and Gene Corman, NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST was filmed in seven days on a budget of less than seventy thousand dollars, and it looks it.  The movie is more or less a riff on the Howard Hawks classic THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the story of astronaut John (Michael Emmet) who crashes to earth and who's dead body is rescued by a team of five scientists including his fiancee Julie (Angela Benson.)  But it soon transpires that John is not dead and he has brought a little something back from space with him.

In some ways the movie anticipates the iconic 1979 ALIEN, but not enough for fans of that movie to go out of their way to see this one.  The actors aren't bad, but the script is silly, with dialogue that borders on the Ed-Woodsian, the premise is silly, and the monster itself is ludicrous.  While it isn't as incredibly bad as some AIP releases by Roger Corman, it certainly isn't going to win any prizes, and the most you can hope for is a giggle or two at the absurdity of it all.  Watchable for fans of grade C and D 1950s horror flicks, but that's all.

7968153,3,B00006G8I8,"I am totally torn on the decision of how many stars to rate this film. It is nostalgic for me as I saw many low-budget horror flicks like this when I was a kid. However, it seemed that it was written and planned within a few minutes. The monster costume apparently was made in short time, as was the spaceship (after it crashed). They could have made a small model of the flying craft instead of using terrible drawings. Ditto on the drawings of the microscopic cells and the aliens that were in the man's body. Some of the acting was good (Ed Nelson with a poor script). The concept of using a human host to incubate aliens was ahead of its time. Also, you have to give the Cormans and the studio credit for showing us how to save production money.
