4194673,4,B003U9XZYQ,I watched this movie over Christmas with my family in Canada. I am not typically a western movie lover (only a few I really like) but liked this movie for it's humorous spin on a typical western. The whole family greatly enjoyed the movie from the oldest (my eighty-eight year old grandmother was laughing so hard she was crying) to the youngest (twelve year old boy). I definitely would recommend this movie for good laughs for the whole family.,1294012800,6,446,4.658227848101266
4194674,5,B003U9XZYQ,Such a great movie!! Fun and with so many important ideas about who we are and who we can be. One of Paul Gross's finest moments on camera.,1509235200,,139,4.0

4194682,5,B003U9XZYQ,"This movie is a bit tongue and cheek. The characters are somewhat corny and I think you will thoroughly enjoy it if you just watch and don't
judge. It's a good entertaining movie and clean. Family friendly for the most part. There is nothing standard about this western. The line you
will hear throughout the movie is ""What is wrong with you people"".",1478995200,,350,4.571428571428571

4194693,5,B003U9XZYQ,"This is a very clever, well-acted movie. It's kind of a weird, quirky, The Man With No Name meets Anne of Green Gables way. It's a really fun story of a clash of two very different cultures, and it's innocent enough for the entire family to watch. WARNING: The movie itself is really very clean, but the outtakes in the end credits contain some vulgar language, including the F-word. If you want to keep it PG, stop the video when the end credits roll.",1452384000,,452,4.392857142857143
4194694,5,B003U9XZYQ,"One of my favorite movies of all time. An underrated little comedy gem. Movies like this don't come around often enough. The cast and the script are both fantastic.

4194695,5,B003U9XZYQ,"Paul Gross is probably underrated in the United States but he deserves to be on our 'A' list.  I love westerns and have had many favorites including Rooster Cogburn.  Gunless is my new favorite by far, a great family movie and all the flavor of what a western should be. I have given a number of my friends this movie as a gift.

If you like westerns, you will love it.  If westerners aren't your favorite type of movie...You will still like it.  In the opening scene a big burly cowboy arrives in town riding his horse backwards.  Then you notice the rope around his neck and hands tied up ...and he is dragging a tree branch behind the horse.

sex scenes, or bloody body parts flying around.  This was a good clean movie with some humor thrown in.  And of course I always
like a happy ending.  And I really liked the part where Paul Gross twirls the gun around his fingers.  That was amazing how he did
that. (wonder how long it took him to practice that bit.) Great, Great movie!",1424822400,,462,4.204545454545454

4194724,3,B003U9XZYQ,"Kind of stupid, but funny throughout.
It does make one wonder how any of these people managed to survive as long as they did.
From a misguided gunslinger with a warped sense of right and wrong;  the people of a small Canadian town, who all seem to have been fathered by ""The Three Stooges;"" the bounty hunters, who don't know their business; and the RCMP, who seem to be Boston Brahmins at boy scout camp during summer vacation.
The only sensible person in the whole film is the Indian scout attached to the Mounties, who seems to be wondering ""What is it about these white people?"".
I was left with having no idea whatsoever about what this film was trying to accomplish.
The previews for it ( on other dvds I have purchased ) were far better than the whole film.",1422144000,,764,4.418439716312057

I am a long time fan of Paul Gross and am not completely estranged from the western genre, so I was pleased but not surprised to find that this is a good movie. It would be suitable for most ages I believe. There is some, but very little, cursing in the dialogue. So, if anyone reading this is interested in a family friendly, Canadian western, I have no problem fully recommending ""Gunless.""",1409270400,,414,4.4605263157894735

4194752,5,B003U9XZYQ,"This film is a quite different take on the traditional Western genre.  The cultural differences between US and Canadian views of how to live a good life emerge.  Paul Gross is engaging and multidimensional as The Montana Kid, stuck in an environment that challenges his basic assumptions of honor, courage and friendship.  The supporting cast is strong as well.  It will make you think about a lot of things about your life.",1402617600,,424,4.847222222222222
4194753,4,B003U9XZYQ,"Paul Gross is always fun to watch in comedies (Due South) and he does a fine job in this one as a American gunfighter who is being chased by an outlaw gang and flees to a small Canadian town where the people are so darn polite and no one carries a gun.  The short tempered gunfighter calls out the local blacksmith and finds not only does he not have a gun, no one does.  A beautiful local widow has a broken one and offers it to him if he works it off on her farm.  Gross is excellent as the frustrated gunfighter who can't seem to figure out what's going on around him.",1402358400,,571,4.035398230088496

Currently the DVD on Amazon is less than $4.00, so trust me, take the risk and you'll be glad you did. It's good clean fun (all except, as someone else mentioned, for the closing credits, where they show out-takes with a lot of swearing...guess they felt they'd seem more hip that way...but there's absolutely nothing within the movie itself like that!).

It is a gem, filled with dozens of standard Western tropes that turn out quite different from the norm. There are bad guys, good guys (in white hats, no less), fist fights, Chinese laborers, saloons, a hardscrabble farm, etc., presented in an entirely original context.

Loved it. Recommend it for all NRA meetings.",1395187200,,503,4.848837209302325

4194769,4,B003U9XZYQ,"I could have done without the long hair on Paul Gross, but without it & the constant mumble-speak, he wouldn't have  been able to pull off the kind of character that he was trying to play. His abrasive, World weary gunman is a novelty in a town where
kindness & compassion abound. Slowly he begins to see the senselessness of the code he lives by, with predictable results. I was surprised that the story didn't try to glamourize gunfighting. As for objectionable content: there is a scene where a bad guy shoots a boy's dog (to show the people he means business)& there is a brief scene with an unmarried couple waking up next to each other,but otherwise there is no sex & little if any objectionable language. No one you like dies & the ending is predictable,but is that a bad thing ?
The background music was a little bit distracting ( same song repeated a few times throughout the movie) but the scenery was spectacular . Not a block buster but still it is a decent movie",1391817600,,975,4.446927374301676

4194786,5,B003U9XZYQ,"I have recently become reacquainted with Paul Gross, 20 years after his ""due South"" series on CBS in the US, so decided to try to find more productions he's been involved with.  The price on ""Gunless"" was just right, so I knew there'd be no serious loss if I didn't like it.  Well, blow me down!  It is hilarious, and since I often have children in the mix for family movie night, it was important to me that it is refreshingly clean and innocent, too (I do, however, eject the DVD when the credits roll with the rather bawdy outtakes).

The Montana Kid turns out to have engineering skills, and while waiting for a gunfight to materialize, he works on repairing a broken-down old pistol and helps a ranch owner improve her life (and her spread) by hooking a windmill up to her well.  A relationship of a rather amusing adversarial nature develops, each making the most of the other's flaws, but they have ample opportunity to see each other's strengths, too.  The gunslinger sees a tiny town of good, happy, quirky citizens, and because he's understandably tired of the killing and running, the entire picture starts to look pretty attractive to him.  He ponders making a better life.

Canadians and Americans generally come from the same British stock and history, but the southern branch of the family tree often seems brash and considerably less civilized.  This film gives us the chance to know, enjoy, and love our wacky northern cousins. They, of course, think we're pretty wacky, too.",1387584000,2,1492,4.72972972972973

The Montana Kid, a wanted gunslinger, is chased into Canada by four bounty hunters.  The Kid arrives in a small town where no one carries a side arm or abides by ""The Code of the West"".  The Kid over-reacts to almost everything he sees as the residents of the sleepy little town just go about their normal eccentic business.  The story reminds me of the 1960's ""Maverick"" TV show with James Garner.  There is a parody of the classic western shootout from a bath tub, with a very funny result.  The movie builds up to an inevitable comic shootout when the bounty hunters arrive and the movie's ending leaves me feeling good.

Instead, Gunless veers clumsily between uncertainty and a definite lack of commitment to a specific style (one minute slapstick with a sword, the next minute shooting a boy's dog).  I found this peculiar blend of humor and a vain attempt to produce an old-fashioned western off-putting.  Even more disconcerting, and for no reason at all, the movie is also peppered with songs!  Paul Gross, who I normally like, does little more than pose and provide service as straight man to every loon thinking to set up a joke.  I cringed rather than chuckle.  This strange little movie doesn't work as a parody, satire, or a serious western.

4194830,5,B003U9XZYQ,"I liked this movie.
I had no idea what to expect, but the movie came off for me after I decided to just let it flow.
It isn't serious, but it isn't slapstick either. It's subtle humor bordered on not-quite-serious situations, and the viewer somewhat gradually realizes it all...like I said, just let it flow.

I won't go into the plot much, but I will ask: Remember the old american TV show Green Acres? Actor Eddie Albert plays attorney-turned-farmer Oliver Wendell Douglas, who moves to a town where he is the only sane man in a community of quirky characters. They, including Oliver's wife, somehow all understand each other despite their quirks and the surreal situations... That is what struck me about the Montana Kid's (Paul Gross) experience in the frontier Canadian town. He comes in, wounded and on the run. And with his ""Code of the West"" mentality from the wild-west USA, he is quickly determined to shoot it out w/ the local blacksmith who 'insulted' him. Problem is, nobody in town has a working pistol. What to do ?!?
The Code forbids the Kid to shoot an unarmed man outright, and you don't ""quick-draw at high noon"" with a shotgun or a rifle...But I called a showdown, dammit! A matter of honor - I can't call it off!

The townspeople don't understand, or perhaps more accurately, don't care about the conventions of his ""code"". What happens? The Kid ends up like a youngster at a family get-together. Ever go to one, where an older kid chases the younger ones? ""Arggggh!!"" he goes, being the mock-monster. ""Yahhgggg!!!"" the smaller kids scream, running away in semi-mock fright. Eventually they run to a parent or adult: ""So-and-so is CHASING me!!!"" The adult's calm reply: ""Well, just don't run and he CAN'T chase you"".
That's the Kid's humorous dilemma. He wants to 'chase', like the bigger kid at the family gathering, but this obscure little town just won't 'run' like he's used to! And the quirky characters, with their almost-Green Acres-like understandings of each other, largely dismiss him as a danger. Thus the rug is pulled out from underneath the Kid.

My favorite points: I got a kick out of the Kid periodically saying ""What is WRONG with these people??"" in that exasperated gravely/growly voice. Also the scene where he asks someone ""Is the whole country insane, or is it just this town??"". I also liked it when they discovered his real name (Sean? or some such) and started calling him that...Paul Gross was GREAT.

Least favorite parts:  The part where he's encircled by Mounties that beat him at the dance. This stepped a bit out of the realm of the comedic 'box' the film had developed up to that point IMHO.  (Admittedly, I may have missed something there, but regardless, it was quickly resolved by the later scenes)... I also didn't feel the dog being killed by the bounty hunters quite fit in.

Don't misunderstand - this movie is not on the highly surreal level of Green Acres; but it still requires that ""suspension of disbelief"" to enjoy it. Its not hard though - just let it flow...

I liked it, and look forward to getting the DVD.
--Chem.
(PS - you don't like this type of humor? Well, remember what Eddie Albert once said about the silliness of Green Acres: ""It was over the heads of most people..."":)",1333324800,3,3248,4.705985915492958
4194831,5,B003U9XZYQ,"Westerns are not usually my thing, but I'm happy I came across this film. It is not big budget or in any way impressive, but it is a lot of fun.

The Montana Kid (Paul Gross) has a bit of a problem: he smells like a pigsty, he has a bullet in his backside, and he's narrowly escaped a hanging... and is dragging the tree branch behind him. While he is unconscious, his horse wanders across the Canadian border and winds up in a small town where no one seems to be armed. What he wants most is to get out of there, but he can't... because the local blacksmith has insulted him by calling him ""common."" The Montana Kid just can't stand for that kind of an insult, so he challenges the man to a gunfight. Problem is, no one has a revolver... except for Jane Taylor (Sienna Guillory), and she will only give him the rusted piece of metal if he helps her get her windmill up and working.

Her revolver has seen better days. In fact, when he picks it up, the handle falls off. But you cannot just ride out of town when you have challenged someone to a duel, so he sets about fixing it and waiting for parts. Never mind there is a posse on his tail. Never mind that the townspeople are all very curious about him. Never mind that he is running up a tab at the local store/tea house. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, even if it means being himself instead of the Montana Kid.

I'll put it right out there: at times, this movie is stupid, but since it is not trying to be anything but stupid, it works. It is a fun-loving western that does not take its characters, setting, or dialogue too seriously. Instead, it offers us humorous clichs and tongue in cheek characterization: the trigger-happy gunslinger, the local man obsessed with a stump he can't pull out, the bickering store owners, the Chinese family that can't speak a word of English, and the Canadian Mounted Officer who can't quote the rules just right. It isn't hilarious, but it is amusing and the cast is not half bad. There are moments the dialogue sticks but for the most part, I was having too much fun to care. It is mostly contained in a western town, but there is an impressive gunfight (that starts by accident) and some beautiful costumes going for it. The score is also cheeky in all the right ways.

Westerns (or indeed, any kind of film) that are appropriate for younger audiences are hard to find, but this is one of them. It is not perfect, but it is also not a kid's movie. It never feels childish or convoluted, and there are some meaningful scenes in it, as the Kid comes to realize that he doesn't have to fight. He can walk away if he wants to, even if it means dealing with the remorse of his past actions. It is not an award-winning production, but it does what it sets out to do: entertain.",1332892800,5,2774,4.278095238095238
4194832,5,B003U9XZYQ,"What can I say that has not already been said?

Story line is interesting, Actors are all first rate, production quality is excellent. Perhaps the most underappreciated movies of recent films.

This is a very funny movie set in the old West, er, North. It centers on an American gunfighter that just cant seem to get a fight going no matter how hard he tries. Its full of kooky characters that you cant help but like. It's a lot of subtle humor much like a British comedy. This is one of those movies that you just cant help but like. There is a common sense message here that is the underlying theme of the movie.

This has the potential to become a cult classic. It has become one of my favorite movies. As a matter of fact I stopped by Amazon to pick up 3 copies of the DVD, one for me and two as gifts.

It's a shame I'm not a skilled writer, this movies deserves a better review than I can post. Do yourself a favor, check out this movie.",1327708800,4,943,4.164835164835165
4194833,5,B003U9XZYQ,"This movie is a favorite now.  It is funny and has a good message.  Mostly though, it is not something I have to work at watching.  I don't need to pick it apart or work hard to find some hidden dramatic meaning.  It's purely entertaining, which is what I generally like in movies.  The characters and the actors who play them are great - diverse in personality.  Melodie Choi is just about the cutest kid I've ever seen in a movie and a good actor as well.  And Paul Gross -- well aside from the good acting, has a voice that is perfect for the character.  A few familiar faces are in this movie, but mostly actors who are relatively new to movies and/or not usually seen in the US movie market.  The only negative thing I can say about it is the language in the outtakes during the end credits.  Otherwise it couldn't be better.  It's good fun and I highly recommend it to just about anyone.  Paul Gross's character is a gunslinger and does talk about the eleven people he's killed, so parents might want to monitor that and ""guide"" any young children.  I, personally, would have no problem allowing younger kids to watch this, with that guidance.",1327363200,8,1149,4.414285714285715
4194834,3,B003U9XZYQ,"This is an odd and unpredictable, almost anti-Western film made by those quirky Canadians.  It takes place some time in the northwest, not quite the wild west, and features a town whose inhabitants would rather not use guns even though a gunslinger who arrives would like to do just that.",1325548800,2,288,4.76
4194835,5,B003U9XZYQ,"I'm not usually one to go out of my way to watch a western, but this one looked just quirky enough to maybe be worth a look.

In this show a notorious gunfighter, ""The Montana Kid"", flees north to escape a team of bounty hunters.  He rides into a small western town and promptly keels over.  He has been shot in an unfortunate spot -- you'll have to watch to find out where.  Anyway, shortly after coming to and wandering around the town, crossing paths with nearly everyone in short order he ""has words"" with the local blacksmith, and ""The Kid"" demands satisfaction.  He ""calls him out"", after the code of the old west.  Well, there's one big problem...the smith doesn't own a handgun.  The Kid can't believe it.  In his book you can't be a man unless you carry a gun and know how to use it.  What he didn't realize is that when he rode north he entered Canada, and happened into a small town of about 17 people...none of whom wears a gun.  He can't believe it!  And he then finds himself stranded in town until he can heal well enough to move on, that is, after he has a gunfight with the smith.

I found this entire scenario to be hilarious!  I watched it all the way through, wondering what mishap could happen next.

If you like shows like ""Rustler's Rhapsody"" or even ""Quigley Down Under"" then you will like this one.  It's more comedy and romantic comedy than it is western.  But, whatever it is, it's got the right balance of what it takes to hold an audience.

I'm truly glad I didn't miss it!

5 stars for this understated comedy that I hope will soon fly above the radar!",1319414400,8,1582,4.305084745762712

4194837,5,B003U9XZYQ,"I watched this on Netflix the other day and was not expecting much from it... I am happy to say that it caught me off guard.

4194838,4,B003U9XZYQ,"Oh those kooky Canadians. Leave it to them to come up with this way out of left field movie. I suppose this sort of ""fish out of water"" thing has been done before, but this is so lively and fresh it just plain feels brand new.

Here's the scoop. Paul Gross, after dodging a hanging, finds himself in some bust-out Canadian town. He's on his horse, but he's been shot in the butt, rolled around in pig doo-doo and tied up. A long time bounty hunter/adversary is on his tail as he finds himself with an odd assortment of towns people who he must stay with (for at least a while) before he can get back on his horse and ride. It's that ""at least a while"" part that ends up messing with his head.

This movie is a real hoot. It's peppered with an oddball bunch of characters and somehow the goofy plot line makes its own kind of sense. They're such a crazy bunch they create a good juxtaposition to Gross's character. Yes he's killed men. Many men. But he's not a bad guy. His sense of right and wrong just somehow got out of hand. Now he meets a girl to whom he's indebted and he starts to realize that the constant running, and his sense of justice, might not be the best way to live. It almost plays out out like an episode of the ""Andy Griffith Show.""

It's set in a sparse part of Canada in a small town so the budget must have been manageable. But it doesn't look cheap. It's shot well and all the actors, even the secondary ones, do a really good job. You love these people and want to be with them. The music is good as well. There are a couple of quirky, tongue in cheek, tunes that help keep things light. This seems to be taking place in the late 19th century, but the language and many of the sensibilities are strictly ""now."" I don't know squat about Paul Gross but he handles his role extremely well. He's created a very memorable character. He reminds me a great deal of Josh Brolin. Sienna Guillroy is the love interest and she's quite fetching. These two make a fine pair.

I cannot say enough about this movie. There is no wasted time here. It moves at a decent clip and will not test your sense of time. It's as entertaining as a movie can be and it has a good heart without being cheezy. I had the time of my life watching it and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",1318464000,61,2291,4.176470588235294
4194839,5,B003U9XZYQ,"Gunless is a canadian western with a bit of humor, romance and some excitment. I enjoyed this very much as they don't make any good westerns anymore.",1317772800,2,149,4.555555555555555
4194840,5,B003U9XZYQ,"Not at the farcial level of Mel Brooke's ""Blazing Saddles"", but full of tongue in cheek, and slapstick humor plus winking, cultural commentary, Gunless is a lot of fun!

Paul Gross(quite well known in Canada, I remember him from the ""Red Green Show"") plays a, set in his ways, American gunslinger that flees into a bucolic, Canadian town being chased by, ever getting nearer, bounty hunters.  He gets in a huff with the local, giant of a man, blacksmith and determines to have it out with him if, and a big if, he can find a working six shooter for the showdown.

He takes a job, a trade off, put up a windmill for a gun, with a pretty but struggling rancher, Sienna Guillory(""Inkhart"", ""Resident Evil"").  The townfold are quirky and charming and with the woman do there best to distract him from his plan.

It's well shot and scripted, nice scenery, and there's enough seriousness to it to keep it more in reality than just being a constant joke; moreover, the hero and heroine provide a sweet, developing, but at odds, romance.  My wife won't watch a western unless there's some hint of romance or at least a woman in it.

It's not quite full family fare: the baddies shoot a dog, threaten townfolk, attempt a hanging, but overall, the violence is controlled and made fun of, the language, except for the outtakes, minimum; there's no nudity or sex, one implied encounter, and all things work out for the best with a moral about living peacefully.

Summary, a feel good movie, an unusual, comedic western, that also pokes light fun at cultural differences between US and Canada.",1315008000,24,1580,4.658273381294964

4194843,5,B003U9XZYQ,"then you will like Gunless. Gunless is a calm, earnest and very funny western comedy. The characters are interesting and varied. I fell in love with the whole town.
The storyline is pretty basic - gunfighter with a twitchy trigger finger stumbles into town ahead of the bounty hunters after him. He takes offense at a supposed slight (the blacksmith was looking after his horse without permission)and challenges the blacksmith to a duel. Can't duel because there isn't another pistol in the entire town. There are shotguns and rifles but not a single working pistol. There is a broken pistol...
So there is the introduction to the townsfolk, all of them have an interesting quirk or two, and the meet-cute between the gunfighter and the lady who will be his salvation. The gunfighter is welcomed into the community while he struggles to fix the pistol.
The climax is the duel/shootout at the end. Absolutely hilarious! The bloopers in the end credits are just as entertaining. The extras are well worth the time to view as well. It just looked like they had fun on that set. After all they are The Good, The Bad, The Canadian.",1307750400,6,1126,4.75
4194844,4,B003U9XZYQ,"Paul Gross plays a gunslinger, the Montana Kid in this near western. Paul reminds me of the Mel Gibson of yore, before he became Mr. Hyde. The Kid rides into town tied backward to his horse dragging a broken limb behind him. A young girl who speak-e English-e helps him down. The town graciously accepts him into their Canadian community, in spite of his uncouth ways. The general store doesn't carry a lot, but they can order stuff. It does have tea and escargot.

He ends up living with a woman and helping her build a windmill for her well.

It is a good movie. It is not a great western. It is not a great drama. It is not a great comedy. It spoofs the life of the old west and its ""codes."" No f-bombs, no nudity, no sex.",1304726400,4,725,4.171428571428572

The people of Barclay's Brush, totally unprepared to accept the ways of the ""American wild west;"" offer a chance for redemption to The Montana Kid through acceptance; genuine care and concern.

4194848,4,B003U9XZYQ,"I bought Gunless because I like Paul Gross' work and I wanted to see his new movie. It didn't disappoint. Gunless has a very funny premise: Injured American gunfighter on the run arrives in a Canadian border town, challenges the blacksmith to a gun duel, discovers that there are no working pistols in the town, and has to wait around for days for parts to repair the only pistol before he can kill the poor man.  It's a great twist on a basic Western movie plot. Paul Gross does a very good job as The Montana Kid. He has excellent comedic timing and plays the character as a decent, too serious, frustrated man who has lost his way.  There is a sweet romance, but not too much to turn off the guys in the audience.  Sienna Guillory is a wonderful foil for Gross' comedy and, along with the rest of the ensemble, projects an innocent inability to understand this American's need for dueling and revenge.  The actors all have a wonderful talent for comedy, the Alberta setting is gorgeous, and the ending is very satisfactory.  This movie doesn't pretend to be great art, but it's a whole lot of fun.  I highly recommend it. (By the way, I understand that this may be the only Canadian Western in existence. It has an all Canadian cast, I think, and you can tell they had fun making.)",1296518400,9,1284,4.4425531914893615

This is also a great movie to watch with the whole family as there is little objectionable content (one scene may be disturbing for young viewers when a dog is shot, and two characters do engage in sex (off-screen) and wake up together) and clean language (the word ""ass"" is used a couple of times). However, I wish the DVD had closed-captioning. I am hard of hearing and while I can turn up the TV, the way Paul Gross tends to mumble his words makes them difficult to understand. Overall, though, the film itself is enjoyable. It's the product that could just use the improvement of closed-captioning to make it better.",1528588800,,710,4.688
