3964069,3,B002P8LKCM,"The picture quality of the films in this set is just better than vhs, full frame, no extras. Part 3, despite boasting Bill Mosely and two actors from Twin Peaks, is a dull, ridiculous waste of time. It's not so bad it's good, it's just a poor conclusion to the killer santa story from the first two films. Part 4 is my least favorite Brian Yuzna film, but it's got some great bug/monster effects around the half way mark. It's also got Clint Howard being repugnant as usual, which is a bonus. Part 5 is fun and inventive with the best kills of the three films and some excessive silly looking gore. Overall, I'm glad I bought this set, and Lions Gate should be commended for releasing a set of catalog titles at a nice price.",1261612800,7,725,4.338235294117647
3964070,1,B002P8LKCM,"Silent Night, Deadly Night 1 and 2 were classics. Many may disagree with the second film being good but I think it's funny. Listen to the director's commentary on the dvd and you'll see why. That being said, I couldn't wait to view the rest of the series but Santa delivered a pile of coal instead. The picture quality is clear and crisp. The only extra's is trailers for other Lion Gates films and many of them were released long ago. The problem with this set is simple- these movies friggin SUCK! I couldn't get thru all of part 3 because the acting was so bad and it seemed censored because there is no gore at all, let alone action. I can understand buying this set to complete the series but don't buy them if you have not seen the first two movies. These are so really crappy films and I'd stay far away from them.",1259884800,2,821,4.269230769230769
3964071,3,B002P8LKCM,"Picture quality is rough; it looks like the old video masters.  Strangely, all the discs seem to automatically zoom to 16X9 on my Sony HDTV. I do not have any sort of automatic setting on either in either my TV or my Blu-ray player, these are the only discs I own that do it. In fact, I thought they were 16X9 until I tried them in on a 4X3 set.",1259798400,,345,3.9285714285714284
3964072,5,B002P8LKCM,"I love these movies and have waited a long time to see them get a DVD release.  LionsGate's release of these three sequels to the classic originals leaves a lot to be desired.  First, they are NOT in widescreen.  They are 4 x 3 standard only (there is no widescreen edition offered according to the LionsGate website). The transfers are not restored and have quite a bit of dirt and some print fade. I suppose it is possible that this release presents the films in their original aspect ratio as they were all three made straight for video by Live Entertainment.  I don't know, all I've ever seen are my VHS copies. Still, Amazon lists them as being widescreen. The soundtracks are stereo only.  There are NO special features. Zero.  Too bad Anchor Bay couldn't have released these and did a job like they did for their release of parts 1 and 2. Anyway, thats what you get with this edition: parts 3,4 and 5 in unrestored versions and nothing else. Also, this is in no way a BOXED set as claimed.  It looks like any other DVD release in a standard case with one of those flippy things in the middle. The DVD's all have the same grey paint job, making them difficult to tell apart and they all have the same annoying LionsGate advertisements at the startup and they all have the same (non-animated) menu design (which consists of play and scene selection). The DVD comes in a cardboard slipcase with excellent new cover art.

Amazon has also dropped the ball on shipping these things.  I pre-ordered mine so I would have it on the street date and the day after the street date they sent my an email saying they were unable to get copies and it would be another couple of weeks wait.  I went to BestBuy and bought mine off the shelf the same day.  What's the deal?

So how are the movies?  Part 3 tries to keep the original plot of the first two going by having Ricky in a coma at the beginning of the film.  He soon wakes up and starts his killing spree again.  This is a strange entry in the series.  It's very slow paced and having Richard Beymer and Eric Da Re from Twin Peaks in the cast is also sort of surreal.  I suppose the most frightening thing about it is seeing Eric Da Re looking like a wet Sasquatch in a bubble bath.  Casting devil's reject Bill Mosley as Ricky was just the wrong choice.  His emaciated frame just dosen't come close to the beefy musclebound Eric Freeman from part 2.  The dome on the head is pretty lame as well.  Also in this film is Elizabeth Hoffman, a great actress (from FEAR NO EVIL). Robert Culp is also wandering around in this one.  While this film uses far fewer flashbacks than part 2, it lacks the exploitative charm of the second sequel, and of course, it's missing the bug-eyed Freeman performance.

In spite of the presence of PHANTASM'S Reggie Banister, part 4 is a complete shambles.  There are a couple of nasty sequences in it but a cult of lesbian bug worshipers is not my idea of a great Christmas horror film.  The grotesque, pumpkinfaced Clint Howard is also a revolting addition.  While this film is often repulsive, it is never scary and never whips up any Christmasy atmosphere.

Part 5 is probably the best of all the sequels and the one that comes closest to the quality of the original film (in tone and execution if not in storyline).  Micky Rooney chews the scenery and is quite good in his role as Petto.
Clint Howard is back for an appearance in this one as well but he looks a bit more human in this one in spite of his unfortunate face.  When all is said and done, this one is just another killer toy movie, but it IS a pretty good one and while it will never be the classic that part 1 is (Part one being one of the greatest slasher films of all time) it is certainly a worthy addition to this franchise.

Curiously now that parts 3,4 and 5 are at long last available, Anchor Bay has pulled parts 1 and 2 from distribution and they are now commanding ridiculous prices.  Crazy.",1259712000,15,3945,4.363013698630137

3964087,4,B002P8LKCM,"This was a blind buy for me, having never seen ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" parts 3 and 4 before. I had seen Part 5 on HBO when I was about 12 years old but barely remembered it. Part 3 continues the storyline from the first two movies with a comatose Ricky Caldwell (Bill Mosely replacing the irreplaceable Eric Freeman from Part 2) awakened by a blind psychic teenager (the beautiful Samantha Scully). The writer of this mess seemed to have Ricky confused with Billy Caldwell, the Santa Claus killer from Part 1. Ricky was never shot in the head and the flashbacks to the first film only show Billy, not Ricky. This sequel had potential but wastes too much time on long, meaningless shots and bad acting. Most of the kills happen off screen which hurts the entertainment value. After a while, I found myself checking the clock to see how much time was left before it was over. Yeah, it was pretty dull and boring.
Part 4, although unrelated to the previous films, is actually quite interesting and unique. It stars a gorgeous actress named Neith Hunter as Kim, a newspaper reporter who takes it upon herself to investigate the mysterious death of a woman who fell off a rooftop and ""spontaneously combusted."" Kim becomes entangled in a strange cult of witches who seem to have a weird lesbian relationship with one another. There are some gross-out special effects courtesy of ""Screaming Mad"" George and a memorable appearance by Clint Howard as Ricky (not the same Ricky from the previous films). ""Silent Night, Deadly Night 4"" has little to do with the Christmas theme established by its predecessors, but as a standalone flick it's quite good.
Part 5 is subtitled ""The Toy Maker"" and stars Mickey Rooney as Joe Petto (get it?) who runs a toy store along with his strange, freaky son named Pino. Kim (Neith Hunter) returns in a small role as a neighbor along with her adopted ward Lonnie (Conan Yuzna) who she saved at the end of Part 4. Part 5 is also quite good despite being unrelated to the first three movies in the series. It also has some memorable special effects courtesy of ""Screaming Mad"" George and a bit of a surprise at the end.
I highly recommend this 3-disc DVD set if you can get it for $15 or less. These movies have now become annual Christmas viewing for me. Enjoy!",1356566400,,2289,4.599022004889975

The so called part 2 even cuts the flash back scenes from part one and changes the story, the original classic must have been banned in the US. So nobody saw it and in the later 80's they put out part two to show people most of the original! Also the other sequels, while having little to do with Christmas are great fun and I promise you'll enjoy them! They are like lost classics! Too bad there in full screen and not buy Anchorbay. They are great fun fun and a steal at the price. PS. Remember buy just part One of SNDN it's all you need and 3, 4 and 5. Have fun!",1267833600,2,911,3.9297297297297296
3964095,3,B002P8LKCM,"This year we've seen plenty of older films finally make it to DVD.  Night of the Creeps, Trapped, Choke Canyon, and finally the last three SNDN sequels.  The one thing that sets this release apart from the others, however, is how this one was handled.  It's safe to say that a few of those other titles are better known than ""The Toymaker,"" but would it have been so difficult to throw a trailer or poster gallery onto one of the discs?  Instead we get three identical discs with three identical title menus along with three of the same LGF trailers.

More than extras though I'd just have preferred better transfers and for the film to be in the correct aspect ratios.

As far as the films go if you're reading this chances are you know what you're getting into.  The only sequel that continues the story line from the first two movies is SNDN 3.  The other two films have nothing to do with the original two, in fact part 4 has nothing to do with Christmas at all.

8376733,4,B002P8LKCM,"Silent Night Deadly Night 3 takes place a few years following the events of Silent Night Deadly Night 2. After being shot down by police at the conclusion of the previous film, Ricky Caldwell has been in a comatose state for the last 6 years, with a transparent dome being affixed to his head by the doctors in order to repair his damaged skull. Hes under the examination of Dr. Newbury who believes Ricky may be the key to understanding criminal behavior if only a psychic link can be formed.
He uses another one of his patients, Laura Anderson, a blind teenage girl, as an experiment method to try and reach out to him. Things seem fine and well until Laura begins having terrifying visions and dreams concerning Ricky that accidentally links her with him. Laura begins to regret taking part in the experiment but Newbury doesnt want her to go and convinces her to talk about it after she returns from the Christmas holiday.
Later that afternoon, Laura is picked up by her brother Chris and his girlfriend, Jerri en-route to their grandmothers house for Christmas. Later that same afternoon, a facility worker dressed as Santa, wakes Ricky from his deep sleep after making wisecracks about his coma. Awake from his coma and looking to hurt someone, Ricky goes after the one person he feels is his last connection in life; Laura.

Overall: After how atrocious SN, DN 2 was, this was only a slight step up for a sequel. The acting isn't really impressive by any means necessary, but unlike the previous film, we get a wider story plotwell at least sort of. Its never revealed why Ricky is after Laura. Does he want her? Does he love her? Does he want to kill her? Its an open-ended storyline that inevitably goes nowhere. The delivery of the kill scenes is excruciatingly bad. Ricky walks around for most of the film with a slouched, psycho look on his face with his skull exposed, but most of the victims just treat him like hes completely normal. After Eric Freemans jabroni portrayal of Ricky in the last film, we were given the legendary Bill Moseley as Ricky this time around. Unfortunately, hes reduced to being a slow, soft-speaking villain who doesnt do much to strike fear into people. On top of that, the Santa suit was completely absent for the Ricky character this time around. The hospital gown and ordinary civilian clothes are the only clothes he wears. This would be the last movie in the film in the series to feature Ricky or any mention of the Caldwells in any way. Overall, slightly better than the first sequel but by no means, a perfect movie

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

After a woman mysteriously falls to her death off a rooftop from spontaneous combustion, would-be journalist, the local LA media quickly picks up on the story. Not long after the opening intro, were introduced to would-be journalist, Kim Levitt, who works in a rather male dominated newspaper company with her boyfriend, Hank and her boss, Eli. As the story on the mysterious death gains a lot of media attention, Kim decides to pursue the story on her own, without Elis approval.

Her investigation brings her to a local bookstore, looking for books on spontaneous combustion. The owner of the bookstore, Fima recommends her taking a different book, titled The Initiation of the Virgin Goddess. Kim initially refuses, but Fima insists she takes it and declares it Kims invitation to a picnic shes having at the park the next afternoon with some friends.
Following the picnic, Kim is thrown into a world of illusions and utter chaos as she soon she finds herself being terrorized by visions of life sized insects. Kim soon finds out that shes become an unwilling recipient of Fimas evil feminist witch cult. With powers from Egyptian goddess, Isis, Fima plans to use Kims body to resurrect her dead and make her the queen of her cult. Forced into a situation against her will, Kim must now fight for her freedom or become the sacrificial lamb for this crazed cult

Overall: Silent Night, Deadly Night 4 tends to get a lot of unnecessary flak from fans due to the lack of a Santa killer in this movie. Honestly, I was completely fine with there not being a Santa killer in this edition of the film. After the previous 2 SN, DN films completely bombed, taking out the Santa element seemed best to really give the series a fresher route with more open-ended plots. While this movie does take place during the Christmas season, the Christmas theme is just a minor background role and doesnt have much influence on the film like the first 3 movies did. The plot is interesting, the acting is decent, and the story kept me watching for a good portion of the film. Initiation gets really insect happy with this film, making this is a somewhat gross installation of the movie. Seriously; beetles, roaches, larvae, disgusting. The movie has a decent line up of well-known stars, including Clint Howard and Maud Adams. On another note, it was the first movie that didn't feature any relation to Ricky Caldwell or Billy Chapman. A scene from SN, DN 3 makes a small, brief appearance in the movie but thats about it. Overall, Initiation is a good film. Its its own plot and was probably the best Silent Night, Deadly Night of the 4 that had been released during this time since the first one.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: Toy Maker is the final installation of the Silent Night, Deadly Night series and is perhaps my favorite behind the 1984 classic that kicked off the series. The film opens late one December night with a young boy, Derek Quinn opening the door to his house after hearing the doorbell ring to find a Christmas present left at the doorstep for him. His father, Tom, finds him and scolds him for being up so late and sends him off to bed before curiously opening the present. Derek watches from the steps as Tom unravels the gift to find a Santa shaped musical orb that ends up strangling him with snake like arms.

As Tom struggles, he loses his balance and falls into a fire poker that impales through his head, killing him. Weeks later, following Tom's death, Derek has become a mute, not saying a word since that night. To try and somewhat brighten the mood, his mother, Sarah takes him to the local toy store, owned by the well known Joe Petto to look for a toy. While there, they encounter Joe's socially strange son, Pino who tries to offer Derek a larvae toy (slight reference to SN, DN 4 there) but he wants nothing to do with it. All the while, a mysterious man named Noah is often seen stalking Sarah and Derek--even going as far as to dress as a mall Santa to get close to them but why? A reason they'll soon learn. As if things weren't already odd enough, more killer toys keep appearing at the doorstep and in the house of Derek and Sarah that are trying to kill Derek. Who's trying to kill Derek and why do they want this kid dead? Is it the toy store owner, Joe? Is it his son, Pino? Or is it the strange and puzzling stalker Derek?

Overall: For a final film to the Silent Night, Deadly Night series, this was a pretty good way to close it out. It was the first one since the 1984 SN, DN to have a strong Christmas theme and just be all around nicely written. Just like SN, DN 3 and 4, this film does have minor references to the previous SN, DN film. We do get the return of a killer Santa but unfortunately it's not until late in the film. Some of the kill scenes in Toy Maker are lame while others are nicely executed. Legendary movie star Mickey Rooney (RIP) who ironically enough negatively criticized the first Silent Night, Deadly Night, finds himself in this final installment as perhaps the best acting performance of the film. Toy Maker mixes elements of previous SN, DN films along with Child's Play and Puppet Master to deliver this final film to the series. Overall, Toy Maker is engaging, creepy, and weird all at the same time and after struggling to keep the series fairly balanced, they did good at closing it out on a good note. Overall, fans of the Silent Night, Deadly Night series should give this a buy. Better Watch Out (3) is probably the weakest one of all 3 films on this set. Initiation is plausible and Toy Maker is marvelously told",1450483200,,8378,4.7094133697135065
8376734,5,B002P8LKCM,"I bought this brand new and it came in the original packaging and the discs were excellent.  I saw one person complain on another review that the film was in VHS quality but it became apparent to me that they were remastered.  The sound was good the quality was great overall I am impressed with this purchase.

I have the previous Silent Night, Deadly Night films and adding these three completed my collection.  In all honesty I loved Silent Night, Deadly Night 3 but Initiation and The Toymaker (Silent Night, Deadly Night 4 and 5) were decent.  Part three follows the previous films but to be honest the ending to Better Watch Out is kind of creepy and unnerving.  Initiation is downright gross and Toymaker is blah in my opinion.

Overall since I heard this DVD set was out of print I am glad to say I own the entire series and got my hands on it when I did.  These movies are B-movie classics from the forgotten IVE/Live era.  Worth the purchase if you are a rare collector of horror like I am!",1448928000,4,1000,4.391304347826087
