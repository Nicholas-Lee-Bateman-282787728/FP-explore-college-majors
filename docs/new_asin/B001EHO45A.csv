8298199,4,B001EHO45A,"I would have given this film 5 stars if the quality of the film and editing was better. Some parts were cut or edited in a manner that I thought there was something wrong with the DVD. But The actors were well cast and did a great job. This is also a fun movie for children. Shah Rukh as always is very good, talented and funny. Great actor, dancer, musician and entertainer.  Entertaining and fun movie.",1381708800,2,404,4.315789473684211
8298200,4,B001EHO45A,"I purchased this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. This is one of his earlier films. The storyline has some similarities to Blackbeard's Ghost. I enjoyed watching it. It is not one of my favorites of Shah Rukh Khan's, but I still like it.",1334880000,4,247,4.166666666666667
