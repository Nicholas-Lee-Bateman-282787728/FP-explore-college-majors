8314953,3,B001KF6FA8,"This ""Aida"" is mainly for fanciers of operatic stage craft and in no small way, as it is mounted using the antique *trompe l'oueil"" scenic designs of Jose Mestres Cabanes, who created 3-D illusions using paint on paper. They even fool the HD cameras. Unfortunately, some idiot had the idea of showing the stagehands raising the flats during the prelude, which drives a cart and horses through the desired illusion. So points off for that. Cabanes' work deserves to be seen but not at $40.

Musically, matters are a mixed grill. Mario Armiliato both looks and sounds like a hero should, and he enjoys his B-flats. The plush timbre and Italianate ductus of Juan Pons' Amonasro are also a positive element, although he can be seen to better advantage in a Zurich production. Elisabetta Fiorillo's voice is afflicted with a pervasive quiver that immediately renders her *hors de combat* and a hollow wobble is getting the upper hand on Roberto Scandiuzzi (Ramfis) and his once-handsome basso. Stefano Palatchi's King of Egypt scores points for the home team, as do the strong Messenger and Priestess.

That leaves us with the late Daniela Dessi's Aida, who has the high C for the Nile Scene and holds it long enough to prove it good and right. Otherwise, the carapace on her *forte* singing betrays the fact that this is essentially a lyric soprano sailing in spinto waters. Miguel Gomez-Martinez, a hack of some considerable durability, cheapens Verdi's music with frequent and cheesy accelerandos. There is a good and informative background feature on the sets, although it unwittingly reinforces the point that the background is, in essence, the foreground. ""Aida"" seekers are still urged to investigate the Tucci/Simionato/del Monaco and Gencer/Cossotto/Bergonzi performances or, if state of the art picture and sound are a must, Nina Stemme's Aida, in a lightly conceptualist production, from Zurich.",1494028800,,1901,5.129032258064516

8314955,4,B001KF6FA8,"It's a delicious, beautiful production, the best I've found, just above the one with children.  However.  It's impossible to play.  There are about 6 infinitesimal dashes that are kind of colored.  You've got to try and get the right color in the right dash to get the movie.  If you don't (and I rarely do), you get a slow photo album of the cast, a slow series of pictures representing the scenes, your choice of stereo or surround sound (try to avoid that one!) or a documentary on how the sets were made.  The only one of these you can stop and get out of is the docu, the rest just keep going.  And for some sadistic reason the opera is unnecessarily (as so many are) on two discs, lying on top of each other in the box.  Which means at act 3 you juggle and struggle and pray (if you still go in for that sort of thing) to get one disc on or off the player and hold the other without dropping and ruining one or both.

Radames is ugly as sin but sings like a butch angel.  Amneris looks old enough to be his mother and sings with a vibrato just short of Callas.  Aida is young, beautiful and sings like a dream.  The sets (which everyone is at great and constant pains to point out) are very beautiful.  They are certainly nicer to look at than the lock-down or the clinical green rats' maze in the last 2 Maria Stuardas I was unfortunate enough to buy.

Except the children's one (another of Zeffirelli's ""brain"" children), I have at last found an Aida I like.  It took long ($$$$) enough!

Note:  Excuse the unfunny sarcasm.  Amneris is a bit younger than all that, shines in the last act.  Unlike the Domingo (which I sold for about $2 - a bargain), the director did not buy out every vegetable market in the county to parade (to what purpose?) in the entrance, and no horses, no elephants, the best triumphal entrance (and probably the last, I'm sticking) I've seen. And I must point out that just about every reviewer on this stupid site uses the expression ""trompe-l'oeil"".  That phrase is on the DVD box and is just French for optical illusion.  It sounds so much more erudite in French!",1315612800,,2099,4.3307692307692305

The whole dvd is far too dark. Save your money for the dvd with Kate Aldrich.  You will know why, when you watch her.  That dvd is zero risk.",1269302400,2,286,3.8620689655172415
8314957,5,B001KF6FA8,"Readers might wonder why virtually all my reviews are 5-star. It is because usually I don't review anything I don't like

It is not considered the done thing to criticise another reviewer's comments, but to downgrade an opera production purely on the physical attributes of the performers is trivial in the extreme, and shows little understanding of the art form.  I would recommend readers to refer back to the reviews of the earlier release of this performance on Opus Arte as an import, but is now under local distribution by Kultur.

Opera, to me, is the greatest of the performing arts. At one time opera was a vehicle primarily for a singer to display his/her vocal talents. But well before Aida, it had become a combination of performing arts - orchestra, soloists who needed to both sing well and also act through their singing as well as visually, and if the drama required it, a chorus that usually needed to act; and settings, costumes, possibly a ballet, etc all contributing to carrying the story. So the performance of an opera does not just need singers who can produce a beautiful sound; they must be able to sing dramatically to contribute to all the components that combine to make the stage production the composer was aiming for.

(If physical appearance was given too much importance, we would have been denied most of the stage performances of Sutherland, and we would rarely see Madama Butterfly, as Butterfly is in her teens and it is unlikely one would find a soprano of that age who could sing the role).  Enough of these general comments, let me turn to this production.

Although I have only seen three live productions of Aida (none outstanding) I have seen quite a few on video or DVD, and considering all aspects of the performance, which is how a stage performance must be judged, this is the most satisfying version I have heard and seen - it is also one of the very few which is complete. Most readers will have some familiarity with the opera, so I will assume such familiarity.

Much has been said about the spectacular sets in the original import on Opus Arte (the Kultur release is just US distribution of the same Opus Arte product and so does not have the poor quality of many Kultur releases). I can only say that I have never seen settings, for any opera, that come close. Normally sets of this apparent extravagance and detail are only found in a movie studio. Costumes, lighting and video direction are of comparable standard. But despite my earlier comments, it is the performance that is of prime importance.

The cast has been well-chosen, their voices and dramatic talents matching and blending well. As is appropriate for Aida, intensely detailed histrionic acting is not as relevant as in some operas I could think of. For example, the chorus is used in the common European approach (now disappearing to a large degree) of marching on, forming a tableau and singing their contribution, then marching off when no longer needed. But this approach works well as it is a well-choreographed, integrated part of the entire production concept.

What of the soloists? Fabio Armilliato as Radames is faced with 'Celeste Aida' right near the start before he has had a chance to warm up. Consequently, he ends full voice, rather than the preferred whisper. But he has a very fine Italianate tenor voice, and carries his role well throughout the entire production. Daniela Dessi as Aida, and Elisabetta Fiorillo are both a little indefinite in pitch initially, both exhibiting a vibrato a little too wide for my taste. However, this improves quickly as their voices warm up; Aida's 'Ritorna vincitor!' works well as an example, and both give outstanding interpretations. The other soloists are uniformly excellent throughout their roles.

Of course, act two is dominated by the Triumphal sequence in scene 2. The transition between scenes leaves the viewer gasping, as does the entire scene. No elephants, but an enormous chorus (plus supernumeraries). And at this point I will take the opportunity to say that throughout the entire opera, the large orchestra (plus off-stage band) and the chorus are highly polished and could not noticeably be bettered. At a couple of spots the conductor makes some brief unexpected moves with tempi, but overall, shows an excellent grasp of the work and a matching control of his forces.

The release is divided over two DVDs; acts 1 and 2, then acts 3 and 4; which leads me to consider the opera in two halves. In the latter DVD, both female leads seem to be singing with a tighter control on their voices, as if they are fresher - the difference is only slight as they are both 'warmed up' well before the end of act 1, but it is significant as they each face their most demanding scenes in the 'second half', and it makes me think it was recorded on a different night. Verdi does indulge his three principals, and they each have ample opportunity to display their vocal and dramatic skills, although, in this production, the drama is primarily contained in the singing. The female leads both rise to the demands of long solos, with performances that are almost unbeatable, taking the visual aspect of the performances into consideration along with the vocal skills. The audience responds accordingly.

This is a long review, so I will round it off. There is great consistency in this production; all aspects combine superbly to give a performance that, considered in its totality, is really hard to beat. Technically, the eye is ravished not only by the incredible sets and costumes, but by a crisp image full of gorgeously rich color and 16:9 widescreen. The sound is DTS 5.1 at its best (justifying DVDs over the limited sound quality of CDs straight off) with full, rich, wide-range sound revealing an excellent balance between stage and pit.

This is a ""must buy"" for every lover of this opera. It is a presentation which I am certain would have brought great delight to Verdi. Even if you have a version where you have a preference for some of the singers, you should make this your second version. Don't let it pass you by.",1244851200,3,6106,4.78727445394112
8314958,3,B001KF6FA8,"The great attraction of this DVD is that it's not as 1950's Hollywood-epic style ""kitschy"" as some of the other productions available.  It's an incredible opportunity to see the opera played against the painted paper flats created by a great Catalan artist more than sixty years ago, lovingly restored.  The music is conducted well, and the triumphal march, in particular, comes off very well.  Although most productions highlight the spectacular aspects, this one unusually and correctly stresses the more intimate human drama.  Irritating details are relatively few - the tiger-skin sported by Aida's father, Amanasro, is one (an Ethiopian chief in tiger-skin in the time of the Pharoahs?  perhaps a tiger was especially imported?).

But oh the roles of Aida and Amneris!  After seeing this opera it's possible to understand why the first presentation of Verdi's Traviata was laughed off the stage because the soprano was too fat to be credible.

Neither of the two actresses here is even somewhat attractive, or of an age to make their parts plausible.  It stretches the imagination too much to consider this Aida a woman with whom a triumphant young general could fall in love, let alone  for whom he would abandon his country. The acting of both the female leads is so stilted/monochromatic, as well, that it becomes boring.  Radames, on the other hand, looks slightly crazed most of the time - perhaps this is just over-acting.  This wouldn't matter if it were to be heard as an opera on CD, rather than watched on DVD.",1241049600,2,1525,4.960629921259843
