2777658,4,B000NQQ4LU,I really enjoyed this movie! It was funny and not to serious! Great for children to enjoy with family! Sometimes it got corny but it had a wonderful message and kept me laughing :),1361232000,,180,4.323529411764706
2777659,4,B000NQQ4LU,I chose this rating because it was a good movie and i would recommend it to everyone to watch. I gave it four stars.,1355961600,,116,3.875
2777660,1,B000NQQ4LU,"I bought this dvd and I must say that I was truly disappointed. It is a very low budget film with unbelievable scenario throughtout the whole movie film. The acting was absolutely horrible with a lot of unknown actors and it wasn't even funny. At best, this could be bearable to watch as a grade school play. I am truly disappointed that time and money was used to make this film.",1318291200,,380,4.366197183098592
2777661,4,B000NQQ4LU,"Yes, this is a low-budget film, but it's WAY better than lots of others I've seen. Deals with some real issues and seeks to offer hope in spite of. If you can get past a few cheap stereotypical characters, etc., I think you'll find this overall to be an enjoyable film.",1312934400,,269,4.294117647058823
2777662,2,B000NQQ4LU,"The only great thing about this film was the 5 minutes Debra Wilson was on camera. I've rated this two stars, I did not enjoy this film, but the camera work is mostly okay. Most scenes looked pretty nice.
 Very few scenes were interesting to watch, at times watching the ridiculous comedy acting was painful. During serious or supposedly heartwarming scenes I tuned in and out because the boring drawn out dialogue was irrelevant to the story. (As if to show other ethnic groups) ""...see? This is how black people act! Aren't they lively?""
An example of this is about 20 minutes into the film, we have a camera shot that is 6 minutes long - nothing in it but two friends (Jewels and Kayla) sitting in their car talking about Kayla's relationship with her boyfriend, and Jewels lack of girlfriends. Realistically, this conversation would take place during the drive to their job. In the film they just sit in the parked car for 6 minutes.

I can understand why the conversation was not filmed in the moving car, maybe it was too dangerous for Joe Clair to act and drive at the same time, maybe there was not enough in the budget for compositing talent to insert moving traffic footage. The point is, I, the viewer should not be pondering why this scene is so lame.
A better solution would be to voice over the conversation showing the car driving to it's  destination. I should be engrossed in the story, though I was not at any point during this movie. It makes me sad when I see a mediocre black film such as this. I do have a feeling this was better as a play, but I do not have any desire to watch and compare the play to this film. There is so much more wrong with this film but I do not have the patience or energy to explain them all, so briefly...

2777663,4,B000NQQ4LU,I enjoyed this movie.  It was funny and fun to watch.  A good movie.  Very little cursing or violence.,1271980800,,102,4.2631578947368425
2777664,1,B000NQQ4LU,"The characters of Rev. Thomas and Kayla are charming, however, they could not make up for the very tiring acting of Joe Clair and Johnny Brown, and the offensive over-acting of the rest of the cast.  The plot is just about non-existent, and I couldn't help but think that this movie, if made at all, should have been made in the ""Good Times"" of the seventies when just about everyone had bad taste.",1204329600,7,398,4.4520547945205475
2777665,5,B000NQQ4LU,"I rented this movie based on a friend's recommendation, and ended up buying my own copy. Very enjoyable! Written and directed on a low budget by child actor-turned director Shavar Ross (Dudley Ramsey from ""Diff'rent Strokes""), this quirky little story is good family entertainment.  The camera loves newcomer Nadia Turner (former American Idol contestant and Christian rock band guitarist) as sweet and sexy Kayla.  Hip-hop actor Joe Clair is lovable as Kayla's friend and co-conspirator, Jewels.  Veteran TV comedian, Johnny Brown, is delightfully funny as the preacher's opportunistic brother, Cephas.  And Bill Toliver brings dignity and comedic charm to the grieving widower, Reverend Thomas.

The interviews on the DVD are also worth watching, to hear how each actor approached their character, and to show the obvious camraderie between this delightful ensemble.  Good job!  More like it, please.",1183161600,8,902,5.54014598540146
2777666,5,B000NQQ4LU,"The movie got stronger scene by scene and I am already looking forward
to seeing a sequel and prequel since the story line was just that good
in my opinion.

You could really feel the love of the entire cast and production crew
from the movie.

Buy the movie if you are interested in seeing a great story develop,
include a few surprises, and make you feel inspired and encouraged
about love, faith, and relationships.

Congratulations to former child actor Shavar Ross on his first feature
film. Not every former child star can make a claim to his achievement and professionalism.",1181692800,9,581,4.732673267326732

Probably doesn't fit the bill with general critics; however, I felt it to be heart-warming and simple. Nothing fancy; no bling, a simple message underneath: That God's choice for you is in your face.",1364688000,2,294,4.462962962962963
