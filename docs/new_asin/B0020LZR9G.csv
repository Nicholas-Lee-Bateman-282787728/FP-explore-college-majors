8655495,5,B0020LZR9G,"I used to watch this show when i was a kid and thought why not go back to my childhood. I mean with all of the movies that have come out that were based on cartoons i watched as a kid like transformers,spiderman,batman, and G.I. Joe, why not travel back in time in a sense and relive the shows i loved as a child. This DVD set is awesome plenty of episodes on this 4 disk set to keep your mind going and the memories flowing! I even had my son (who is 9 years old) watch them and he even loves the show. he loves how the vehicles change to something else. That probably was the best part about this set is that i have something that my son and i can both watch anytime. If you were a fan of this show when you was a kid then you need to buy this set and all the others out there and bring back the memories of when saturday morning cartoons was the best tv watching of the week. When you forced yourself to get up at 6 in the morning so you could watch everything from beginning to end. This DVD set is definitly worth 5 stars and the money i paid for it. Amazon.com is an awesome site to buy from. Can't wait to buy more from them!",1246924800,5,1132,3.9047619047619047

8655498,5,B0020LZR9G,"I was starting to think this show would never make it to DVD. But, sure enough here it is. The set has a total of 38 episodes on 4 discs. The quality of the transfers are perfect. If you like MASK, you will love this set.",1192924800,,221,3.8260869565217392
8655499,2,B0020LZR9G,"This pertains to the Vortex Pictures release of this Box Set. I purchased this DVD set since I'm a fan of 80's cartoons and I'm utterly disappointed with the quality of this set. Now maybe due to the fact, Transformers, G.I.Joe, He-Man, Voltron and several other toons all came out remastered and packaged with extras I'm a bit spoiled. This thing looks like a Hong Kong Bootleg with 4 discs crammed with 8-9 episodes each and nothing else. The quality of the video is on par with VHS and is pixelatted in certain scenes. Audio on Disc 1 is very low and I had to crank the volume 2x fold to hear it, disc 2 is fine. I've never seen the UK PAL Version of this set but I'm hoping it's better. It does seem very fishy that the studio is named Vortex which coincides with the 90's lame M.A.S.K. series Vortech. Plus in their intro they steal music from the Sailor Moon series. Someone should check into this Company and see if they do have the rights to this series. Overall, get this if you're a fan and you'd like to have M.A.S.K. in some way shape or form, if not wait till it gets released by another studio.",1192233600,6,1108,4.280952380952381
8655500,4,B0020LZR9G,"M.A.S.K. is one of those shows that I remember loving as a kid.  Do I still love it as an adult?  Sort of.  It's a bit repetitive, as kids shows often are, but I still enjoyed it after all these years.

The DVDs themselves, though the packaging is excellent, the discs are pressed (not burned), and the quality is pretty good, appear to be either Hong Kong imports or darn good bootlegs.  The episodes appear to be converted from PAL as the aspect ratio is slightly off and the audio is just a bit faster than I remember (a side effect of converting PAL, which is used in Europe, to NTSC format, which is used in USA).

These facts detract only slightly from the viewing experience, but for the price you do get 38 episodes on 4 DVDs, which is half the series.  Since this show is still tied up in rights disputes and has no release date in the USA, I'd say for die-hard M.A.S.K. fans this is probably worth the money.",1191456000,,918,4.271676300578035
8655501,3,B0020LZR9G,"Now granted I was 13 in 1985 when M.A.S.K. was on the air, I guess I shouldn't expect much. I was slightly fearful of purchasing this box set (thinking it might be a H.K. rip off or something), but I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the picture is about as good as can expected (it is an '80s cartoon after all).",1186444800,,320,4.17741935483871
8655502,5,B0020LZR9G,"I remembered when I was young, I saw this one in on tv and my favourite characters were Matt Trakker and his Thunderhawks, Brad Turner with Condor and Vanessa Warfield with Manta. Mask animated series was aired on September 16, 1985 by the people at DIC Enterprise. M.A.S.K stands for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand which is a group of special organization to destroy V.E.N.O.M(Vicious Evil Network Of Mayhem) and its mastermind, Miles Mayhem. The dvd I owned now were stated on the cover of box set as region 1 but I do not think this one is an originally studio released. Only 4 disc containing 38 episodes instead of 75 episodes. The transfered audio and video were so so. No subtitles and extra only about profiles of 4 characters such as Matt Trakker, Brad Turner, Gloria Baker and Bruce Sato. Hopefully someday the copyright holder of this animation series will release the dvd with excellent crystal clear picture with subtitles and extra info of the characters. The only reason I gave this one 5 stars because of I really loves this show.",1186185600,3,1045,4.747252747252747
