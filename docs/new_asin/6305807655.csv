1073418,2,6305807655,"According to Leonard Maltin's book, ""The Disney Films,"" James Garner wanted some film roles, and Disney Studios wanted some star power.  This was the first of a 2 film deal that was made.  I started watching this film with such hope.  Hey, westerns are my favorite type of film.  I love James Garner.  What went wrong?  The film starts with a great premise of Garner, wanted for desertion teaming up with a white boy who had been kidnapped by the Indians and raised as one of them.  The boy is rescued by the army, but wants only to return to his tribe.  The two find themselves on the run from the army.  The problem is Garner's character lacks all the charm that Garner is famous for.  The boy is not very likable either.  Vera Miles and Jodi Foster portray the most likable characters in the film, but they are on screen for too few scenes.  All in all, this film was a disappointment.",1415836800,3,888,4.380368098159509

1073423,4,6305807655,"This Walt Disney offering is a Western beautifully photographed in Southern, Utah in Technicolor with James Garner, Vera Miles and a fine supporting cast doing well in an off-beat story of a calvary soldier on the run for having mercy on the Indians while on an official mission of attack against them. He ends up fleeing with the help of a young lad and a grumpy camel. Garner is always good and the scenery and camel help make this a fine family Western.",1398816000,,456,4.506024096385542

1073508,5,6305807655,"James Garner portrays a  deserting U.S. Cavalry soldier, who has stolen the army's camel and gets saddled with a runaway Indian boy, who turns out to be a white boy raised by Indians, and is trying to get back to his tribe.  Their journey is humorous and sometimes poignant, and the two eventually come to an understanding and grow fond of each other.  The reason James Garner is running from the Calvary is not given until toward the end of the movie, and it's not what you might expect, and makes you respect his character more.  Adventure, drama, suspense, and humor--it's all here and very engaging.",1358812800,2,603,4.660377358490566

What a stupid and cruel way to end a FAMILY movie.  I think life will teach kids about death without a movie doing it.  It is of the same ilk as ""Ring of Bright Water"" where another idiot kills the star of the show, an Otter, with a shovel at the end of the movie.  Why any of these other reviewers could say this is a great family movie is beyond me.",1342137600,,489,3.9591836734693877

However, I was a little disappointed by the ending, but I won't reveal what happened to prevent spoilers.  Still, if you're looking for a DVD to enjoy with the little kids in your life, I recommend this one.",1274313600,,457,4.27906976744186

1073573,4,6305807655,"BEHIND THE SCENES & TRUE TRIVIA: Directed by Bernard McEveety (not to be confused with his brothers Vince or Joe, who also directed at Disney Studios). Bernard also directed ""The Bears and I"", ""Napoleon and Samantha"", as well as ""The Boy and the Bronc Buster"". Filming took place near Kanab, Utah. The film pulls together a stellar cast including James Garner, Vera Miles, Jodie Foster, Jay Silverheels, Jim Davis and Clay O'Brian . Jodie Foster appeared in 4 Disney theatrical movies during this period, and 1 television movie for Disney, ""Menace on the Mountain"". Jodie Foster broke her ankle during filming, one of a series of mishaps on the project including a flood, a fire, stuntman injuries, and lightning striking a plane carrying the cast and crew. There actually was a testing program for the suitability of stylizing camels in the southwest states by the U.S. Calvary during the period the movie is portraying. Released in theatres on June 20, 1973 well after the passing of Mr. Walt Disney. It was aired as a two episode story on the Disney weekly television show ""Wonderful World of Disney on NBC on September 26, and October 3, 1976. It was first released to VHS in 1986 in the Disney clamshell, prior to the 200 release by Anchor Bay. Anchor Bay remastered the video image and sound, and released a widescreen VHS version as well. 91 minutes in length. He film is a bit slow at times, but enjoyable overall, suitable for all ages.

THE STORY: When a U.S. Cavalryman attempts to intercede in a massacre of a village, he is branded an outlaw charged with mutiny. He flees towards old Mexico with U.S. property, two camels Rosie and her calf, Thirsty. Along the way he reluctantly befriends a 10 year old named Mark, raised by Indians, who is also on the run. The cavalry is hot on their heels. The two come across a remote homestead run by a widow and her daughter, who in turn must decide whether to aid the strangers on the run or to slow them down for their pursuers.",1225670400,9,1983,4.6335227272727275
1073574,5,6305807655,"Seeing this movie for the first time a few days ago, I was impressed by how it still has issues that are faced today. When a person is in the military, and they are given orders they have difficulty with, do they obey their commander, or their conscience?  Would they be willing to go with what they believe against orders, even if they would be executed for it?

This movie was made at the end of the Cowboys are the good guys and Indians are the bad guys era. It is much more historically accurate, and shows things from the Indians point of view also. James Garner and Vera Miles are brilliant as always. There are some hair-raising moments which add to the action, as well as humorous and heart touching ones.

I saw this on DVD, and would have liked to have seen an interview with the actors, especially what it was like to have worked with the animals involved. Who else but Disney would have come up with James Garner being chased on a camel ? So much fun!",1194739200,,963,4.30939226519337
1073575,3,6305807655,"You have to start this with one thing in mind - this is a Disney film. That means you have a very white washed, comedic view of what is happening. In essence this is a ""family gathering up"" story, involving a guy and his ""son"", meeting up with a lady and her daughter. Cute romance is sure to follow.

First, the guy and son. James Garner is Keyes, who deserted from the army - but of course it was for a noble cause. He quickly runs into Mark, a kid who at first glance *looks* like an Indian, but of course he isn't. He was a white boy captured by the Cheyenne natives, who is now free again. The two have a mother-daughter pair of camels who are adoringly ornery.

Off they go in the Utah desert, worrying about both Indians and the army. There are typical hijinks and horseplay as they go. They soon run into a gorgeous blonde lady and her equally gorgeous blonde daughter. Keyes falls for the lady. Mark thinks the girl has cooties.

Of course, in true Disney fashion, everything works out lovely for all involved, with a few spots of age-appropriate minor sadness.

This is a super movie for young tykes, with pretty much zero swearing, violence, or other nastiness that has infiltrated modern media. However, from the point of view of this involving ""one little indian"" - they could have done *Far* better. Why not have had the child actually BE an Indian? Why not show more about native american culture? Really, this is more about ""The Brady Bunch in the Old West"" - certainly a casual, fun romp - but not involving Indians at all.",1164844800,4,1540,4.431095406360424
1073576,4,6305807655,"One Little Indian is a late entry from the Golden Age of Walt Disney, but it's an engaging and enjoyable film. James Garner was in a transitional period here, dabbling with TV and high-grade B-movies like Those Daring Dobermans. He's just as charming as ever, which seems out of place since he IS a deserter. However, as the script is a timely one, his only ""crime"" was disrupting a massacre of a peaceful Indian camp. So perhaps for the only time in history, we have Viet Nam, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, and Jodie Foster coinciding in spacetime.

Several things make this a good movie. An early tip off to the quality is a first-rate Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. Next, and most important, Clay O'brien is a very appealing child actor. Add Jodie Foster to the young'un cast and you've got a nice set of kids. Not only that, but the supporting cast is loaded with familiar faces if you're a Western fan. The only shortcoming is there are too few scenes with Vera Miles. I wish the interlude between her and Mr. Garner had lasted longer. In breaking with current tradition, Andrew Prine plays a clergyman who is honest, sympathetic, and Godly. Hollywood hasn't heard of anything like that in decades! And as for the camel(s), it is not just a gimmick, but is really relevant to the plotline. I suppose if the camel had belched or farted, the movie would appeal more to kids today, but thank God there was once a time when they considered that too vulgar. In short, this is good vintage James Garner with a lot of extras thrown in.",1147910400,35,1531,4.547101449275362
1073577,5,6305807655,"I loved this film.

What an absolutely hilarious movie.  There are scenes that are so unforgettable.... like in the first place.... what is James Garner doing on a camel in the old west?!?!?

But it makes sense as the film goes along.  And the scenes between James Garner and the little boy Clay O'Brien are often comical.  They work great together.  You'd never know that the ""Indian"" boy in this film is the same blonde-haired, blue-eyed youngster in John Wayne's classic film, ""Cahill, U.S. Marshall"".

I enjoy a good comedy film, and this one is near the top of my list.  James Garner is always so believable in whatever role he plays.... and if being a camel-riding, orphan-toting, short-tempered cavalry-escapee is his role, only James Garner can make it seem believable (in the comedy role that it is).

If you wish to view a simple, rural, 1800's-style comedy film that is sure to be enjoyed.... this is one I'd certainly recommend.",1123632000,21,940,4.788819875776397
1073578,3,6305807655,"I remember seeing One Little Indian as a kid so I picked it up. There's not much action but a long traveling story. The interesting thing is the list of up and coming stars that were in it.

Jay Silverheels (Tonto), Jim Davis from the tv show Dallas

Robert Pine from CHIPS, James Garner from Rockford Files and of course Jodie Foster.

As many Disney films there's some action and sad events in the story. A white boy  (Clay O'Brien)who was captured by the indians as a child. Then taken away from his indian ""mother"" whom he wants to get back to. This is a fine family movie for the younger set and for those who want to see the actors before they were famous.",1108512000,6,662,4.272

CC is a nice movie about a cowboy that ends up stuck on an island.  He shows the nice widow woman how to start a cattle ranch instead of tring to far or fish.
OLI is very boring.  Not one of my three kids stayed for the end.  And isn't that the true test of a movie.  It isn't totally what mom or I like, it is also what they will like enough to sit and watch and enjoy.",1059177600,4,582,3.857142857142857
