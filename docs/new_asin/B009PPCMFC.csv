8543666,4,B009PPCMFC,"For most people. B-Rate Films just aren't worth watching.  Most people who read my reviews know that I LOVE my cheese!  And with these, there's no exception!  I gave Full Moon Entertainment's 3 DVD set of Zombie films a shot.  While I won't say I was thrilled by them.  But I won't say that I was dis-appointed either.  When I saw that the ""Halloween Haunts"" DVD was at a good price, I went, let me give it a try.
  Again, I won't say that I am dis-appointed with them, because I am not.  But I won't say I am thrilled with them either.  Full Moon Entertainment definately gives a good try.  And the B-Rate Films from them aren't bad either.  But they lack a certain charm that B-Rates from the late 1980's and before have.
  I do recommend that if you enjoy B-Rate Films, these trio of films from Full Moon Entertainment are worth watching.",1447113600,3,841,4.341935483870968
8543667,4,B009PPCMFC,This 3 dvd set includes skullheads a fun somewhat twisted horror movie which features one nude scene and some gore. Next you get decadent evil 2 which brings back the main characters from the first one and has a nice plot twist. Finally you get the killer eye halloween haunt which is softcore lesbian porn. Lots of nude women and a decent amount of blood/gore. Most straight men will love the last one the most. A fun box set for horror fans.,1444089600,6,443,4.414634146341464
