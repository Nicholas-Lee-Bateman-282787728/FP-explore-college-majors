This is a very old production and is very dated. I didn't think the acting or the overall show was very good. Fortunately- I also found the Patrick Stewart version available through netflix. Now THAT was worth watching!!! I really wouldn't recommend this version unless you are looking for an old, slow and mundane version.",1361145600,,486,4.662790697674419

2727879,5,B000MB4TSQ,"Shakespeare's 39 plays are sometimes filmed by multiple directors by many separate theater groups as well as motion pictures and multiple adaptations. Examples are ""King Lear"" & ""Romeo & Julie. But other plays such as ""Cymbeline"" are extremely rare and this version is one of them. This is the only filmed version that I have found through extensive research. This is a BBC production filmed in 1979 by the Thames Shakespeare Company. This production like most adaptations does not follow the original text by leaving out lines and switching scenes, acts and period. The play takes place in the year zero since that is when the legend of King Cymbeline existed. One rule that Shakespeare seemed to solidify is that of the difference between a comedy & a tragedy. The simple difference is that the hero dies in a tragedy and the hero survives a comedy. Cymbeline is a comedy although it was originally titled ""The Tragedy of King Cymbeline and this play and this adaptation is severely tragic but the last act is an event of redemption, thus, the hero lives. There is no rational reason why I should write the text word for word-that you can find in books of the works of Shakespeare. What I can tell you is that this is a great performance and the only existing one professionally filmed which I could find. So, before this 1979 performance vanishes, I suggest getting it.

2727880,4,B000MB4TSQ,"William Shakespeare's comedy of errors tale of thwarted love (with a little class inequity thrown in) goes through its paces in this British Broadcasting Company version of his play. The story line may sound familiar- Helen, poor but gentile female is smitten by the young man of the house, Count Bertram, and endeavors to win his favor, come hell or high water. That ploy has been tried many a time  although not always by restoring the King of France to health, as here. The young immature Count not knowing what a gem of a woman he has on his hands thinks nothing but to be off to war and other conquests. Not to be denied the love that she has fought so hard to win Helen has a plan to win him back. And the rest is history.

I told you that it would sound familiar like so many screenplays out of Hollywood. Wait a minute- where do you think those screenwriters got their ideas from?  I would only note that off this presentation and given today's mores I do not believe that Helen should have spent five minutes on pursuing the caddish Count but that is another story. As always in a Shakespeare presentation savor the two hours plus of sing song language. That, as almost always, is worth the price of admission.",1197763200,,1219,4.433035714285714
2727881,5,B000MB4TSQ,"I thought this production did an admirable job on its stated intent: to make a production of MacBeth in easy to understand American accents and produce it as a play of this type would have been produced in the 16th century.  The stageing is simple, with very few props, all action is done in one space.  Costumes are rough, as they must have been in Shakespeare's time, with emphasis on acting and language.  Most actors have American accents, with MacBeth (Jeremy Brett) using a modification of his  upper class English accent. His diction is outstanding, and, as in his other performances, his language/voice gifts are prodigious as is his emotional range.  It is a pleasure to get to watch such a versatile actor perform in such a wide range of moods, and he does all extremely well.  The actor who plays MacDuff is also very good.  This is an emotional and very dark play.  Some people don't care to have their emotional experience expanded.  If you are looking for something very traditional, straight and boring, this play (production) may not be for you.  The American actors do not rise to the challenges of the beauty of the English language as well as the Brits in the production do.  I'm a big fan of Shakespeare and would recommend this production to any serious student to get a fine idea of what a great actor can do with a challenge like this play.

2727884,4,B000MB4TSQ,"Enter the myth of the tyrant and his end. The story is so well known that it does not surprise us any more. Macbeth is superstitious, so he believes oracles. But he is on the dark side of the moon, so he only accepts oracles from witches, the weird sisters who are three of course. More about it later. He is a military man, a soldier, a warrior, so he believes in violence, and yet he knows he should be cautious, so he hesitates, but once he has crossed his Rubicon, that is going to be his Styx he cannot come back at all and will go right through his fate. But he is weak in a way, in his very hesitation, and he needs some support that he finds in his Lady Macbeth, a very sly, neurotic and even vicious woman who ends badly since she started badly, thus expanding another title into Alls bad that ends bad. And it sure does.

We are in Scotland, with England in the background, as usual and as always. When will Scotland be of age and walk on her own feet? The old king is murdered by Macbeth who seizes the throne and luckily the two sons of the old king, Malcolm and Donalbain, have managed to leave before the assassination. They are accused of the assassination of course. And after that first crime Macbeth is on a killing road and he gets rid of his own associate Banquo and his family, and he will go on and on, including the whole family and household of Macduff. When you come to the end of the play you can count a good dozen, if not more, of assassinations of nobles and their families. If we counted the servants and household people we would probably come close to one hundred.

And thats when everything is getting sour because of the initial crime. The prediction or prophesy of the three weird sisters is of course sibylline. Macbeth is to be killed by a man not born from a woman and when Great Birnam Wood shall advance against Dunsinane hill. He will be killed by Macduff who was ripped out of his mothers womb and the coming army of Malcolm cuts branches in Great Birnam Wood and carries them in front so that the wood is moving to Dunsinane. But in the meantime Lady Macbeth had become completely insane with guilt, sleepwalking and washing her hands all the time, in fact rubbing them all the time. And she dies, commits suicide just before the final battle. Malcolm arrives in Dunsinane after Macbeths death and is given the crown.

This production is contained mostly inside Macbeths castle with essentially one outside setting for the three witches who work under a dolmen, or standing stones, finding in that a Celtic background. Yet these three weird sisters are not plain witches. They are a typical impersonation of the triple goddess Shakespeare likes so much. First the triple goddess herself, Hecate, the goddess of the underworld and death, who is here the boss of the three weird sisters, then Selene, the goddess of the moon and night, and finally Diana, the goddess of life in the forest and pregnant women. This triple goddess is often referred to as Demeter and her symbols are either a pinecone or a female wolf. Then you have the three Furies or Erinyes who are spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of our life. Then you have many others in Europe. For example the Germanic trinity of women  the three Beten. Their given names are Ambet, Borbet, Wilbet, standing for earth, the sun and the moon, respectively red, white and black goddesses.

What is surprising is the mention of these three witches in Elizabethan times. Shakespeare probably took advantage of the slight relaxation Elizabeth introduced concerning witches probably since her mother Anne Boleyn was accused of witchcraft. Unluckily for witches James I was to retighten the vice on witchcraft because he was really afraid if not superstitious about it. Is Shakespeare alluding to that fact? Difficult to know, even if Macbeth is positioned in Scotland. Yet the play was written in 1606, three years after the coronation of James I in London. In Shakespeares days the connection must have been made. It would be interesting to find out what the reaction of the new king of England was.

The pattern of the elimination of all the protagonists except those who managed to escape Macbeths clutch before he could catch them. The present production is slightly surprising by the appearance of a second young man, the age of Malcolm, the new king, in front of the people assembled at that time in a circle around Malcolm. This young man is outside the circle, between the circle and the dead body of Macbeth on the steps leading to the throne and the image turns reddish and fades out in that reddish shade. We can understand it may be the brother Donalbain with thus some insinuation from the director that the two brothers are going to recreate the Cain and Abel biblical myth. But I do not see that in the text of the play. That kind of situation is not common in Shakespeare, though I can think of two brothers in Titus Andronicus: of course Titus and Marcus, but there is no rivalry between the two, and Saturninus and Bassianus, the two sons of the dead emperor who are going to enter a conflict that will lead the elder son and brother to killing his younger brother. But this case is not common. There are many rivalries between couples of men but most of them are not brothers and not even relatives.

I find this production interesting though maybe slightly stiff for a television production. The weird sisters could have been enhanced with some simple special effects for example, and the advancing Great Birnam Wood could have been shown instead of just being reported.

2727892,5,B000MB4TSQ,"I am 15 years old and am absolutely in love with Shakespeare. This is one of the best Macbeth productions I've seen so far. The reason this isn't acclaimed is because of production value and how Lady Macbeth was more sexual than they thought she should be. But in my opinion, Lady Macbeth should be sexy. How else would she convince her husband to murder somebody? It adds to the play. The acting, in my opinion, was amazing. At times it was rough but those times were rare and it didn't take away from the production at all. Shakespeare's words were handled with care by the actors and no words were slurred to make it hard to follow. This is a million times better than the Orson Welles version which I had such a hard time getting through. In my opinion, if you're gonna do a Shakespeare movie, do it with love for the text. Don't cut things or change things. That's why this version is so great. I would definitely recommend this for anybody who is a fan of Shakespeare.

2727895,5,B000MB4TSQ,"I first began collecting the complete collection Shakespeare plays in this BBC series in 1988.  In those days the series was only released on VHS tape.  Sometime after 2000 I began collecting the plays in the series which were called the ""histories""--""Richard III,"" ""Henry V"" etc.  During this period of time, most of these plays were in the DVD format.  Slowly, I came to get additional DVDs containing other histories in the BBC Shakepeare series.  However, two of the hardest plays to obtain were ""King John"" and ""Henry VIII.""  However, using the Amazon.com world-wide search mechanism, I have been able to obtain these last two plays in the history series which are rarely seen performed.

Over the seven years between 1978 until 1984, the entire collected works of William Shakespeare's plays were recorded on VHS Video tape and were broadcast on BBC throughout the seven television seasons from 1978 until 1984.  The present play, ""King John,"" was taped by BBC in February of 1984 and was first broadcast in Britain during the seventh season on November 24, 1984 and was broadcast for the first time in the United States the following January of 1985.

2727905,5,B000MB4TSQ,"Ambrose video 1984. Part of ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare"" Produced by the BBC & Time-life Films. Produced by Shaun Sutton. Directed by Jack Gold.

There are many versions of this production and several beautifully illustrated and annotated books. Everyone has their favorite. Yet the only way to be a true favorite is to watch other versions.

This just happens to be one of my favorites as the actors do not outshine the characters. This is close to a minimalist stage production. This is close enough to the writing that it makes for a good classroom presentation.

It is best to know the story before watching the presentation. It starts out with three witches that tell a Scottish general Macbeth that he will become king. Macbeth's wife eggs him on as suggesting that he kill the existing ruler and cousin Duncan to move the process forward. Little did Macbeth and Lady Macbeth (or we for that matter) suspect at the time that they would encounter more blood and supernatural forces to correct the situation.

You may find this a tad more layered than you think as we must decide if the hero Macbeth is really the bad person as suggested by Malcolm and Angus.

Do not over look the politics of the time as they are sometimes overlooked in other presentations.

We also get some or our best quotes as in Act IV, Scene 1"" Double, double toil and trouble, fire burn, and cauldron bubble""

I am an English teacher. I came across this video while taking a Shakespeare class in my Masters program; my strategy was to read along with the BBC audio play and annotate as I went. Then I would watch the BBC video version of the plays. Then I would write whatever I was supposed to write about, usually a 10-15 page paper. I would review the play and search for things using a combo of the book and the video. This was a class that was all about scholarly exploration of the plays on a fairly deep level. My plan worked for me. A key part of what worked was having this video; the true to the text interpretation, no frills costuming and props, and scant creativity with regards to cinematography make it ideal for viewing as a work of Shakespeare. The fluff and glitz of other versions take away from the words and the meanings. If you are looking for a Hollywood version of the play, this is not it. If you are looking for a true and honest rendering of the content of the play, this is for you.

For use in the class:  To start we read I.i-ii. using the audio only from this and then the kids translate these two scenes. Then we watch the first two scenes using this version and discuss the quality of video with relation to the play itself. We then complete Act I and complete several other activities, including a quote activity called 'Who said that and where, and what do they mean?' Then we watch the whole of Act I using this video. After that, with regards to viewing, we mix it up by watching several other adaptations as we continue through the play. And that is that...",1382918400,34,1656,4.352750809061488

Although I am admittedly partial to BBC Shakespeare productions, I was mildly overrun with slightly reserved disdain over the omission of car chase scenes that were in the stage directions of early quartos. But as a whole, this production is a success in spite of the omission, underscored by great supporting acting, and highly disturbing leads.

Whilst I myself am no professed authority on crisis management, it remains hard to escape the notion that this MacBeth guy had issues. Proper deep breathing techniques or a cup of chamomile tea with a dash of honey could have averted much of the impulsive stabbing. Yet, nervous tic management is clearly not the angle the Bard was going for with the plot.

The three witches' ""Double, double toil and trouble"" scene would have benefitted greatly from adding red basalmic and basil to their recipe, if only to improve the curse's flavor. Or better still, Mexican Oregano. Seriously, ever had that in gazpacho? Its subtle earthy smokiness would blend perfectly with eye of newt and toe of frog.

Be advised the product listing description of this film has no Affront-To-Victorian-Sensibilities warning in spite of both of Lady MacBeth's unclad ankles being scandalously visible in an early scene, much to my approving dismay.
