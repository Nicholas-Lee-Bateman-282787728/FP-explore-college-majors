Movie review: How many thumbs are allowed to be up? These kids in Oregon find evidence that Sasquatch is roaming around. That's all you need to know. Justin Long is hilarious, Joey Kern is hilarious, that kid that played Peter Pan one time is hilarious, Uncle Rico is a sheriff, Carl Weathers is a Bigfoot expert... just trust me on this and watch this movie.",1443916800,,502,4.340425531914893
