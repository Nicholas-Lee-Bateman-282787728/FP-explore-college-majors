1784086,5,B00006L9JR,I purchased this DVD as a reference for use in coming up with sparring combinations.  There is such a wealth of information in this DVD it is incredible.  I refer to it often and try to incorporate certain scoring techniques into my own sparring and it has worked well.  I highly recommend this resource.,1185321600,2,304,4.592592592592593
1784087,3,B00006L9JR,"This instructional DVD on TKD is ok, but not worth the money.  It certainly has lots of moves to show you.  But the moves are very sterile and well rehearsed.  The person that the attacker is attacking just stands there and lets the guy execute his moves.  He makes no attempt to defend.  This is great if you are planning on sparring with a zombie, but in real life your opponent is going to move around, defend your move, and counter attack.  This movie is good, and you will get something out of it, but you will not learn how to score in sparring.",1162512000,3,551,4.25
1784088,4,B00006L9JR,"I do taekwondo myself, currently a 4th gup going for 3rd here pretty soon. I have been involved in several sparring competitions myself and came in top 3 as well. Personally, I do not own the video but have seen segments of it . The video is good in that it shows tehniques and how to use them for point sparring. What I don't like about the video is that it doesn't show the ammount of time needed to actually do what it shows you to do nor does it explain you other scoring issues as far as I have seen. Doesn't explain that you cannot hit the head in most competitions unless you are a I dan or higher, does not explain that a certain kick can score points in a middle position as well as in a high position and other issues. As my instructor told me once, it is good to understand things in your mind but you must develop the physical prowess to actually do what your mind intends to do. If you learn a lot of these tehniques and plan on applying them in your next match but you don't practice them enough and don't know how much/how to practice it won't do you much good. It's just like the black belt dvd's . You won't be a blackbelt by watching videos as that is only a small part of your training, practice, practice, practice.",1160265600,,1235,4.15
1784089,5,B00006L9JR,"This man is absolutely amazing!

I can watch his DVD's all day long and never get bored.

I learn something new everytime I watch them.",1158278400,3,135,4.36
1784090,5,B00006L9JR,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Each technique is demonstrated several times so you can review without having to 'rewind'. Sang H. Kim explains what to look for, what you're doing, and why it's effective. I am 100% satisfied with this product.",1127692800,4,251,4.7272727272727275
1784091,4,B00006L9JR,"The DVD is very helpful in that it breaks down successful techniques into well defined chapters. Got a good back kick, and want some new ideas on how to use it? Then you can go to the back kick chapter. I often come back to this DVD and just watch certain sections.

Every technique is presented multiple times, which is also helpful.

Above and beyond excellent content, the quality of production of the DVD is very good. Clear picture, good sound, and good use of the DVD menu.",1124668800,5,479,4.431818181818182
1784092,5,B00006L9JR,"It helped me with my technique in Taekwondo. In the DVD, the moves are repaeted several times, so you can take a good look on how it is done. I look forward to buy more dvd's on Amazon.",1122681600,2,185,3.8947368421052633

7971192,1,B00006L9JR,To much grunting and screaming.,1461024000,,31,5.4
7971193,3,B00006L9JR,Informative but seems repetitive.,1435276800,,33,7.5
7971194,3,B00006L9JR,"it would better if there were less techniques and more details on how to do them.
showing each set a couple times does not give enough detail.",1394409600,,142,4.296296296296297
7971195,5,B00006L9JR,Great video. Helped a great deal with my technique. I also recommend the other videos when you complete the last.,1388188800,,113,4.7
7971196,4,B00006L9JR,"I have used this video to help teach my new sparring students the basics of effective combinations and when to use them.  Though it's not exactly what I was hoping for when I purchased it, I've found that the demonstrations are effective for beginners to learn.",1367280000,2,261,4.673913043478261
7971197,3,B00006L9JR,Try this in a real competition and you might end up in the hospital.  Today's competitors are extremely good.  You might need to practice these techniques over and over and over again.,1358812800,,184,4.71875
7971198,5,B00006L9JR,This video is an awesome learning tool for anyone who sparrs. I help train my son with this and in 2011 he took a Bronze metal in the Jr. Olympics! Very well made and gives you an understanding of how to strike and counter a strike. I can't say enough about this video !!!,1328918400,,272,4.055555555555555
7971199,3,B00006L9JR,"well worth the price of the dvd,he covers alot of techniques and fun to watch.easy to follow demonstrations that are entertaining to watch aswell as educational.i would be any of these dvd's",1313971200,,190,4.96875
7971200,4,B00006L9JR,"Contents: Roundhouse kick, back kick, double kicks, whipping kicks, pushing kick, multiple techniques, ax kick, turn kick, spin whip kick, aero back kick, side kick, set-up, and feint pushing kick.

This DVD delivers exactly what it promises: It doesn't pretend to be the ultimate form of self defense or reality-based martial arts, but a huge selection of techniques to use in Olympic style sparring.  This DVD is ideal for black belts and instructor of Olympic style Taekwondo (WTF). For each of the kicks listed above, there are a series of techniques shown that can be used to score. Each technique is shown at regular speed 5 or 6 times with a brief instructional overdub pointing out key elements. By keeping the details brief, the makers were able to fit 100 different techniques onto an 86 minute DVD!

The production values are decent. There are two men wearing Taekwondo uniforms and the older style chest protectors. They show the technique several times form mostly the same angle with good contact and control. It is fast paced and covers a lot of material. This makes it very fast paced and well suited for experienced practitioners, but more difficult for junior ranked athletes to follow. Thankfully the DVD is very well indexed and it is easy to access the various chapters. This DVD is well worth the money and should be a fine reference for instructors and black belts to use in WTF style schools.",1264377600,4,1416,4.8429752066115705
