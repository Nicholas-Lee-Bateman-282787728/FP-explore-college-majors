8197926,5,B000QXCUFY,"This is a very cool documentary.
I got this because I like the monorail at Disneyland.
I had no idea that the concept of the monorail has been around for a lot longer.
This make me want to travel to these places and ride them myself.",1359763200,,233,4.086956521739131
8197927,5,B000QXCUFY,This is an excellent video - If the future is high speed rail the monorail would be the next logical step. I was fascinated to learn that they have been around for so long.  This is a very good source of information past and present.  I found this video to be very entertaining as well as enlightening.,1275436800,,302,4.280701754385965
8197928,1,B000QXCUFY,"The documentary itself is great however this 2 DVD set is a joke! The main feature is a one hour program that was aired on TV recently. With the commercials removed this was probably between 45 and 50 minutes. That is all that is on Disk one! Disk two contains some out takes and a few photos all of which could have fit easily on a single 2 hr DVD! If you think owning the TV documentary is worth this price you will be happy. If you are expecting more, save your money. The 2 DVD description is very misleading as it pertains to how much footage you are actually getting. It is like buying two one gallon milk containers only to find they are half full.",1259020800,6,655,4.165354330708661
8197929,5,B000QXCUFY,"I saw this at a screening the director had and really enjoyed it.  But be warned, if you're from Los Angeles you'll be really annoyed at how messed-up our public transportation system is here compared to what it SHOULD be!",1210636800,,222,4.55
8197930,5,B000QXCUFY,"This documentary does a great job of depicting the history of monorails and how the technology has been developed for modern use today.  In addition, the cinematography is first rate with some great shoots of the high speed monorail in Shanghai, which can travel 300 MPH.  I would highly recommend this documentary for anyone who is interested in transit and its alternatives.",1209945600,,376,5.048387096774194
8197931,5,B000QXCUFY,"This documentary is great.  Anyone interested in technology, engineering, politics, public policy, city planning, mass transit, or trains will like this movie.  Residents of Los Angeles will be interested to see how and why L.A is so far behind other metropolitan cities across the world when it comes to public transit.  This movie digs up a lot historical facts that any history/politics buff will appreciate.",1209945600,,411,5.292307692307692
