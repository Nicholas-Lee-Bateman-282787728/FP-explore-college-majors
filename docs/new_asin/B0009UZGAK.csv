8067049,5,B0009UZGAK,"This was my daughter's favorite shows to watch (it came on too early for us to catch it on TV).  We had taught her her letters, but this taught her to read really early.  The shows are silly, but often  center around a story.  Farmer's Ken's Puzzle has a great thinking game, To the Ship has female pirates, Be Bop does jazz really well.",1293753600,,337,4.21875
8067050,5,B0009UZGAK,"My 5 1/2 year old son loves it, loves it, loves it!  The DVD set of Between The Lions made his Christmas so memorable.  He was more excited about the DVDs than he was his Thomas & Friends train set.  He's seen several episodes in the library at school & had been asking for his own DVD almost every day.  He's still watching the box set almost every day.",1200960000,3,354,4.086956521739131
8067051,5,B0009UZGAK,Anybody can see these people are very gifted in doing tv phonics.  I admit I'm a closet watcher.  I'm a musician and enjoy the music.  I'd love to own all their shows!,1189296000,2,167,4.15625
8067052,5,B0009UZGAK,"While I haven't seen the movie/ this DVD, I have seen the TV show and absolutely LOVE IT.  It's put out by Sesame Workshop, the makes of Sesame Street (duh) and from time to time the PBS show will have a cameo appearance of the belove Sesame Street characters.  The main story line is that a family of lions operates a library, so most everything that happens surrounds the concept of learning how to read and great books and stories.

The PBS shows embodies the best of ""Sesame Street"" and ""Reading Rainbow.""  It teaches a reading concept, like the sounds of some letters put together, has catchy songs, and has a story that uses that speical sound a lot.  A lot of adult celebrities come on the show briefly too, like Kelly Ripa, Bruno Kirby, Al Roker, Melissa Etheridge, Meridith Viera and more...

My favorite segment of the TV show is ""Cliff Hanger"", a story about a guy names ""Cliff Hanger"" who is actually hanging on a cliff.  He tries to get off the cliff, using a word/phrase from the highlighted sound of the day, but einevitably ends of right where he started from.

CUTE, CUTE, CUTE!  Until today I didn't even know they had this on DVD... it's a MUST BUY!",1165536000,6,1168,4.471698113207547
