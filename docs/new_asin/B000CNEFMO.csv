This is a clear audio and  video presentation, keeps interest and I can assemble my  slides, maps etc. to go with it.  It is of good length (44 min) and lets me keep a presentation session at one hour (about the limit for most people).  The price is reasonable and keeps my costs low when sharing my experience with others.  This DVD, or any for that matter, is  not exhaustive.  I have no experience with other video's by the same producer.  If I were to offer a suggestion I would like to see more sub titles giving names of birds, animals and locations.  It looks like this is one of a family  of short video's.  They probably serve a market where the video is used (as I do) to supplement a talk, personal slides, PowerPoint presentations, etc.",1301097600,,906,4.451219512195122
