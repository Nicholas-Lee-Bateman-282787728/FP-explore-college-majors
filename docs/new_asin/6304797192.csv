7878064,3,6304797192,"Nancy Popp leads this 35 minute hi-lo aerobics video.  She is joined by 7 other ladies, including Jill who is the beginner modifier and does only low impact throughout the entire routine.

After a brief warmup and stretch you dive right into the aerobics, Nancy will say what is coming but there is really no demonstrations, so it may take some several tries to get all the moves down as the choreography is quite dancy.  There are 4 different routines aside from the warmup and cooldown.

The first routine contains grapevines, marches, double jogs in which turns are later added, hamtring curls, step taps into leaps, charleston kicks and v-steps.  Arm movements are added in as well.

The second segment has some cha chas, pivot turns, kick ball changes, marches, skis (hi impact), double tap/slides, step taps where impact is later added, and boxes (side steps going in a box shape).  The segment is taught in two parts, then they are combined.

The third segment includes v-steps (Nancy calls them out outs), front toe taps (hops/turns are added later), grapevines, knee lifts, chasses, and single/double side taps.  Then moves from the warmup return (grapevines, cha chas, cross steps and knee lifts) and they are all combined together.

The final segment is taught in two parts, the first includes double scoots, cross steps, walk up/taps, shuffles and rear lunges.  Impact and turns are added to some of these moves. The second part includes some double side hops and out/ins with little hip shakes added.  Then all of the moves are combined. After all of this Nancy takes you through a cooldown and stretch.

This is a fun routine if you have the patience to learn it, Nancy and her participants seems to really enjoy themselves in this one.  Nancy has great form, and is a pleasant instructor.  Although it would be nice if the moves were demonstrated a little better before just jumping into it.  There is some whooping coming from the background participants, which might annoy some but it isn't as bad as some of the other Crunch workouts.  All in all if you like dancy routine, this might be a good one for you.",1131321600,,2125,4.778082191780822

The moves are hard to learn the first workout cause they expect you to know the moves already, once you get them down you start breaking sweats and feeling the burn. It took me watching this video 3 times to get the moves down.",1028592000,2,290,4.290909090909091
