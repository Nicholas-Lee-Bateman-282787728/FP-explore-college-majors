7972516,5,B00006RCKP,"*I had also plot-reviewed the ""complete series"" edition, so points made there may overlap here (being the same exact show).  Also, the plot (no spoilers) and themes will be common to the other volumes (3 volumes total in this series), but will make mention of unique DVD aspects pertaining to their respective volume.*

""Chance Pop Session"" (some may know it as ""Chance Triangle Session"", just to avoid confusion) is a wonderful 2001 anime series from the same studio that brought you other musical themed anime such as ""Nana"" and ""Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad"".  Compared to the other two mentioned, it is a much lighter fare.  But even so, it does have a good amount of depth and is amazingly uplifting.

FOR CONCERNED PARENTS AND FOLKS:
There is nothing to worry about in this film content-wise.  No nudity, no coarse language, no fan service, not even a hint of innuendo, no real violence.  The 3 girls being pop idols do wear clothes that are similar in cut (pertaining to size) to ballet outfits with their ""Older Sister"", Reika, often wearing performance tights.  But, all in all, it's really clean and conservative on those counts.

MOVING ON...

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
""Chance Pop Session"" is a wonderful show about how 3 young girls from completely different backgrounds can come together, almost like fate, to achieve a common goal.  It highlights teamwork and how their unique lives contribute to the wonderful whole (how much more unique can u get with bringing together a Church choir girl, a street musician, and a rich aristocrat).  An orchestra conductor wrote that in order for a musician to become good, he must be a student of life...in other words allow his life experiences to color the music he plays.  ""Chance Pop Session"" really illustrates that well.  It is a good tale of perseverance and finding your purpose and reason for doing something...to find something greater than yourself.  The show itself is very, very predictable, but then again, I don't think it was meant to be a show of controversy, intrigue, or scandal...just a show about life, fate, and connections.  Still, there are some twists...and some very deep and sorrowful moments.  It's kinda like normal life...no exaggerations, no pizzaz except that which comes with living.

VOICE ACTING:
I personally prefer the Japanese Dubs (with subtitles) over the English Dubs in this case (which is rare for me).  But as I say that, I must say the English voice actors did have a good script and acted their parts very very well.  In fact, I would probably have watched it with English dubs instead.  It's just there's a certain voice type that I can't really stand...and they employed that kind of voice for ONE of the characters.  So again, I only prefer the Japanese dubs not because it's inherently ""better"" or anything like that. I just can't stand one voice type.  Personal preference, completely.  Oh, and it's important to note, that the Japanese/subtitles does use a lot of Japanese mannerisms that may or may not be fully understood for some people.  The English dubbing script stays very true and tight to the original Japanese script, but also is more easily relatable/accessible to a western audience.

MUSIC:
Music is the theme of this show, and therefore hard to avoid looking over.  Personally, I really liked the music a lot...some favorites in this one.  The only important thing to mention is that the idol song list is kinda small and is often replayed A LOT.  I was cool with it, but I know some others would prefer a larger song list as found in ""The Idol M@ster"" (another good - and more recent - anime about idol groups).

DVD EPISODE COUNT:
This is volume 1/3 for the series and it carries episodes 1-5

SPECIAL FEATURES:
This volume basically consists of a gallery of character/production sketches, Japanese Promo Spots, clean opening/closing MV, and an 8-page booklet on ""How to Be a Popstar: Session 1"" (actually it was rather intriguing).

ALL IN ALL:
This show is a wonderful addition to my ""music themed"" shows/movies library.  Very encouraging and uplifting.  What's more, it really is about the music and finding a deeper reason to do it.  A very important series, I think, for aspiring professional musicians.  One thing you learn when you enter the professional/higher field of music, is that it takes much more than a ""passive"" or hobby-like ""love"" for it to make it.  It requires that you develop an even stronger attachment and purpose to music...something that is even greater than yourself.  This show illustrates that well.",1344297600,,4553,4.9032679738562095
7972517,5,B00006RCKP,It was a great story for a 13 episode series. I wasn't expecting much at first. The storyline started off slow and scattered.  Then each episode picked up the pace until everything came together beautifully. Chance Pop Session was a pleasant and emotionally moving surprise.,1297296000,,274,5.088888888888889
7972518,3,B00006RCKP,"I bought this DVD on an impulse for less than $10, and let me just say that it's worth every penny. Granted, for those out there who are die-hard anime buffs, ""Chance Pop Session"" won't raise any eyebrows, but it's still an enjoyable ""American-Idol-esque"" tale about three girls following their dreams. At times, yes, it can go a little slow, but the quirky little pop songs quickly become infectious, and you'll find yourself humming to the tunes long after it's done. Take a chance on ""Chance Pop Session""!",1102464000,,508,4.784090909090909
7972519,5,B00006RCKP,"The Amazon reviewer didn't do this title justice. This is an adorable series about the hopes and dreams of 3 young women who hope to make it big in the pop music industry. The artwork is angular but not without appeal and once you get used to it it's clear the angular style is intentional and seeks to step away from the ""cutesy"" stylization inherent in anime and instead bring the viewer closer to a more realistic world.
The story is paced but delibarate, and more than anything the feel of the show reminds me of the better parts of the 80's TV show ""Fame."" While romance is only a monor aspect of Chance Pop Session it is a good title for anyone who likes anime drama along the lines of Fruits Basket, Someday Dreamers, Millenium Actress, Video Girl AI or perhaps Ai Yori Aoshi. Parents might take note that this title has no nudity, gratuitous sex or even significant violence.
I watched this fully expecting to hate it and have instead found myself moved... and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is looking for a kindly, gentle, uplifting drama.",1087257600,5,1065,4.523316062176166
7972520,2,B00006RCKP,"This short-lived TV series was about three up and coming students in a special talent school. They all wanted to follow in the footsteps of their idol, Reika. After dealing with jealous classmates and a pushy partner, they finally get their own gig together. But still alot of problems evolve, as they normally do in overdramtic shoujo anime like this. The major problem that this series has is there are WAY too many musical montages in it, including one scene in episode 5 that almost looks like a live-action closing credits piece. There are other decent anime titles that are about girls becoming pop idols, although they usually include magical pets that transform them Sailor Moon-style into idols! But then again, this series probably could've used some annoying talking cats to make it more interesting. For J-Pop junkies only!",1080345600,,835,5.014388489208633
7972521,5,B00006RCKP,"My friend has the entire Chance Pop (Triangle) Session series, and she let me borrow it to take a look.  At first I wasn't too hopeful about the series, as it does start out slow--three girls, three different lives, all connected by one mega-star's concert. (The scope of the concert reminded me of NSync's Popodyssey tour--It was portrayed as THAT spectacular.)  After experiencing the concert, the three young women vow to follow in their favorite star's footsteps.
What caught my attention was the careful character development put into the beginning, and (in the fifth episode) the surprising ""mystery"" that they'll all turn out to share--beyond their being at the same concert.  It really pays to pay close attention to the very first episode, as it leaves J.K. Rowling-sized clues (meaning small but significant) for the viewer to keep up with.
Keeping in mind that the series was originally promoted by a real-life Japanese music recording company (Apex, or something like that), some parts of the episodes slow down for music-video like numbers.  Though they may seem boring to some people, they too offer some foreshadowing and character development.  Personally, I love the music in this series, so I don't mind the repetition of the signature songs, but keep in mind that they'll play the 2-3 signature songs (as well as some other songs) over and over and over and over . . . For the intro, for the end credits, for their practices--you get the idea.
Specifically, for this first volume you'll get a good 5-episode start on everything you'll need to know about the characters--spiritually grounded Akari; street smart, hard-working Yuki;  bubbly, pampered (yet not spoiled!) fangirl heiress Nozomi; Superstar singing sensation Reika; and her business-hardened (yet kind) manager Kisaragi Akiba.  They will all eventually discover the common thread that binds their amazing destinies together.
Oh, and one more thing: you'll have a fun time looking for the gentle-looking old man with a pug-looking puppy dog with wings.  He has his purpose, too!
Go ahead and buy it.  If you've watched El Hazard OVA, Tenchi Muyo, or ESPECIALLY Princess Nine, you'll love this series.",1060992000,,2179,5.115492957746479
7972522,4,B00006RCKP,"When I first picked up this DVD, I didn't have real high hopes for it as it seemed a little sappy and childish. However, once I started watching it, I was actually very pleased. I really think this will be a good series. Not the best, mind you, but it could be worse. I think my main beef with this DVD was the songs during the episodes are not translated in the subtitled version. Instead, the lyrics are given in romanji, and so unless you fluently understand Japanese, you'll be at a total loss. But the main characters are full of life and are very well developed...a big plus. This first volume has only scattered bits of the driving subplot for the most part, but by the 5th episode it becomes pretty obvious what will happen. After all, the opening credits kind of give away the eventual result, so don't expect a lot of surprises. As a whole though, this was a nice, warm, and friendly series. Ideal for a break from something heavy like Fushigi Yuugi. I very much recommend this series.",1044316800,,995,4.442622950819672
7972523,5,B00006RCKP,"What's it about:
Three young girls fortituously meet at superstar Reika's concert. They all leave with the same passion for music and the desire to a part of it. The girls enroll in a special music school by Reika's mentor, who selects them for a special ""S"" class. It shows the ups and downs as they become what can only be found if the ""Angel of Music"" smiles upon you.
I was going to give it a 4 because it isn't what I would consider an ""anime great"", but I am giving it a 5 star. Why? Because it accomplishes the story it tries to tell and it does it really well. Quality of video is great, very clean. The story itself (which in my opinion is the most important aspect) is told at a good pace, where you don't find yourself getting bored.
This series is called ""Chance Triangle Session"" in japanese, I am guessing the 3 girls have some sort of symbolic representation for this.
With the advent of ""American Idol"" and the whole idea of becoming a star... this series is fun as it unveils what can happen.",1044316800,,1009,4.287958115183246
