3683835,1,B001LJIN3A,"Although all the steps are demonstrated (without music) in a very good technical way ... if you expect russan ballet students age 13-14 years old you won't see them!
The two american ladies do their best (and they are quite good), but, well they aren't super talented Vaganova students. Better go to youtube and watch the real Vaganova students working!",1238198400,8,353,4.9
8318288,5,B001LJIN3A,This along with the 3rd year DVD is an excellent teaching tool of the method of classical dance. I highly recommend it to any serious teacher,1388620800,,141,4.461538461538462

8318290,5,B001LJIN3A,"This resource is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to better execute, understand, or teach concepts from the Vaganova syllabus.  I found the great demonstrations and instruction invaluable.  Money well spent.",1364688000,,211,5.5625
8318291,5,B001LJIN3A,This video offers beautiful live music for presenting a ballet level 4 class. It is a great tool for teachers or anyone interested in ballet.,1357084800,,141,4.68
8318292,5,B001LJIN3A,"The author has her students to demonstrate all the steps of the level 4 syllabus by Vaganova method. This is awesome tool for teachers, as well as helpful instruction for ambitious ballet students who would like to learn the proper technique. Also great class presented as an example with life music.",1356998400,,300,4.901960784313726
8318293,2,B001LJIN3A,"I've used other videos that demonstrate class, and classical technique.  This was not in the same class as my DVDs by Dmitri Roudenev, Oleg Briansky, and Suki Shorer.  Without music, the demonstrations are cold.  I miss the music and the ""fire"" of dancers working.",1356912000,,264,4.954545454545454
8318294,5,B001LJIN3A,"This DVD really shows the essence of Vaganova ballet training. The exercises are really demanding for 12-14 year old students, making other syllabus look too soft. I had always wanted to try Vaganova technique and this DVD enabled me to do it. For me, personnally, it is the best training an aspiring ballet dancer can have. The exercises emphasize balance, resistance, style, clear positions of the feet, softness of the arms and a great sense of musicality.
I wish I could find the complete collection of all levels, including pointe work.
It is an excellent tool both for teachers and students from other styles in order to achieve a more versatile ballet workout.",1308528000,8,667,4.911504424778761

8318296,5,B001LJIN3A,"This video is so incredible!  It shows that students, under the right direction , can and will execute the technique in the Vaganova method with the correct instruction.  This teacher is clearly well trained and extremely motivating for her young students.  The results portrayed here on this video are unlike any other I've ever come across!  This video is a must!!!  Excellent.  Thanks for sharing.",1238457600,9,400,5.076923076923077
8318297,5,B001LJIN3A,"This dvd provides a demonstration of the material that comprises Level Four of the Vaganova syllabus.  Each step that is to be learned and mastered in this level is shown individually, then used in a sample class at the end of the dvd.  The concepts that are to be taught in level four are also presented.  This is not a dvd distributed by The State Vaganova Ballet Academy of St. Petersburgh, Russia.  However, Dmitriy Tuboltsev graduated from the Academy and has countless years of experience teaching around the world and in the USA.  Here he uses his talented American students to demonstrate.  This dvd is a must have for any teacher following the Vaganova syllabus.  I have been unable to find any other videos of this kind, where the complete level four syllabus (or any level for that matter) is laid out and demonstrated.  A resource like this is invaluable.  I will be reviewing it often and recommend it to all teachers of intermediate ballet students.",1238457600,4,963,4.753012048192771
