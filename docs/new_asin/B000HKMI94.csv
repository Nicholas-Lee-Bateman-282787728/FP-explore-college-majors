8140216,4,B000HKMI94,I have loved this movie (although it is very corny) since I was a child. It was the perfect film to show my primary aged students when we were learning about ants because it is entertaining and educational.,1474588800,,206,4.447368421052632
8140217,3,B000HKMI94,"Shipping was fast and the DVD was sealed, but unfortunately was the disk loose in it what caused scratches on the disk. That is why the disk is not playing without some little issues.",1422576000,,183,4.411764705882353
8140218,5,B000HKMI94,"Gallavants was a favorite when I was a kid and I still enjoy it! I watched it with my 4 yr old and he didn't particularly care for all the singing, but for the most part, it kept his attention.",1415318400,,193,3.85

8140221,5,B000HKMI94,"I have been looking for this movie for several years now, and after doing a google/yahoo search on the description of what I remembered the movie being about, I found it! Woo hoo!

If you are watching this for the first time, odds are you are going to think the movie is pretty bad due to the dated graphics/low budget animation of the film. If you, like me, watched and loved this as a tiny human, you're going to relive all those corny songs and love it! This version includes all the songs and scenes from the original release, nothing has been cut from this version.

So if you purchased a DVD and found that it was missing content then I would suggest buying this one, it's not missing a thing! Keep in mind, it's an old grainy animation and hasn't been retouched, but hey it looks just like it did when you saw it on your TV as a kid :)",1363737600,3,842,4.191358024691358
8140222,5,B000HKMI94,"This is a classic children's movie. I'm surprised that so few people have heard of it. This was, hands down, my favorite movie as a kid.  Highly recomended!!!",1194739200,9,158,4.642857142857143
