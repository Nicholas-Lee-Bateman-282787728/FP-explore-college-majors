7887950,2,6305350728,"If you're reading this, I'm sure you have a pretty good idea of who or what the DIRTY PAIR are...two bikini-wearing, loose cannons who ""get the job done,"" when all else fails.
There's a lot of gun play, lots of cleavage, and some funny repartee between the two catty heroines. In fact, the one liners are probably the most amusing part, given the rest of the story is pretty run of the mill.
If you must see it, it's worth renting or buying used, if you can find it really cheap.",1018224000,,479,4.274725274725275
7887951,5,6305350728,"The entire Dirty Pair series is exactly what most people expect of animated programming, light-hearted, action-packed, empty-headed comic relief. Each episode is a comic romp of high-spirited hi-jinx. Does this sound more like a cartoon than modern anime? Perhaps that's because The Dirty Pair are one of the older anime offerings, something that is apparent from the moment the viewer turns on the tape. The animation style is much more basic than titles like Bubblegum Crisis or the classic Ghost in the Shell. Plots are simplistic and character development non-existent. But there are tons of laughs and non-stop fireworks throughout. The costumes are scanty and the language can be a bit rough, but both adults and adolescents will have a blast with The Dirty Pair!",998870400,,769,5.16
7887952,4,6305350728,"In these first two episodes of a ten episode series, World Works and Welfare Association Trouble Consultants Kei and Yuri are sent out to deal with situations of pressing difficulty. First off, the prisoners at a remote prison on a VERY inhospitable planet break out and take the warden hostage. Since the warden's testimony is needed at an upcoming trial Kei and Yuri are sent in to rescue him while a squadron of Marines prepares to make an all out assault. When they find the warden, it's almost over until the two Consultants and the warden are separated. Determined to kill as many prisoners as he can for killing his men and ruining a spotless service record, the warden makes the assignment even more difficult.
Next, in the city where WWWA HQ is located, Kei and Yuri chase after a rouge robot that was stolen from a weapons lab. Damaged and set to go into a deadly ""KILL EM ALL"" mode in less than an hour, a hard job is made harder with costumed revellers celebrating Halloween in the streets and groups of crooks using the festivities as cover for their heists.
It's a messy situation all right, but the two episodes are not only classic retro styled animation but the breezy humor and action are a good start to the ten episodes.",977616000,,1240,4.565022421524664
7887953,4,6305350728,"I don't know whether or not this video was released as a companion to (or reaction to) the recent remake ""Dirty Pair Flash,"" but it's good to see the real Kei and Yuri back on video again.
As anime releases go,  this one definitely looks dated, with a general look and style reminiscent  more of Voltron than of recent releases like Evangelion.  And the subtitled  dialogue sometimes doesn't quite get the proper context right.
However,  the plotlines are perfect playgrounds for Kei and Yuri's M.O.--lots of  heavy weapons, lots of collateral damage, all while still being able to get  the job done.
The first story (a prison riot) is the grittier of the two,  while the second (a runaway robot weapon on Halloween) is definitely  funnier and more light-hearted.  Both stories are entertaining to watch,  and feature a more ""innocent"" approach than its many descendants  (not necessarily including ""Flash"")--e.g., the girls do not  disrobe, and there is very little coarse language and only minor  violence.
Fans of the ""girls-with-guns"" genre should definitely  pick up this video, but it will make a fine addition to any anime  collector's library.",931824000,2,1151,5.042553191489362
