8451648,4,B0050Q8NIA,Secrets of a kept woman (the play) was a nice presentation. This was the first stage production by established author Shani Dowdell and although the set design was a bit lacking...the plot and story line was very good. The actors deserve much praise for their performances.,1339113600,,273,4.956521739130435
