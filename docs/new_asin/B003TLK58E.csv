8405212,4,B003TLK58E,"The description on Amazon seems to suggest that English is one of the available languages, but this Spanish version of La Leyenda de Sweety Barret has no option for either English subtitles or English spoken. Odd, since it was originally filmed in English. You can pretty much get the gist of the film by just watching it, but still, English is my first langauge and I would have been happy to just have subtitles.",1312588800,,414,4.608108108108108
