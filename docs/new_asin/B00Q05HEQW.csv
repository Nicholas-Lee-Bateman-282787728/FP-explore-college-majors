6839413,3,B00Q05HEQW,"The Bikini Avengers do not wear bikinis, nor much of anything else. They are a spoof of Batman and Robin, the popular TV series. They work as reporters and from their manor can use their computer to predict the next crime target: Princess Brushka of Baklava.

The bulk of the 81 minutes is spent on soft core sex scenes. Acting was bad, although I thought the film had potential if they opted to go with more plot.

No swearing. Sex and nudity ( Erika Jordan of ""Sharknado 3"", Jacqui Holland, Sarah Hunter, Cassandra Cruz, Beverly Lynne)",1437955200,5,537,4.583333333333333

8689931,4,B00Q05HEQW,"This costumed heroine picture does what few others within this genre do, it actually contains a plot, and some characterization.

The acting could be better, and the direction and cinematography is kind of flat, and yes, its soft-core porn so sex does predominate.  But that said, it actually succeeds where other DVDs featuring costumed heroines (Heroines of SWORD; Super Babes) fail:  It tells a coherent story where the heroines triumph by virtue of their own actions, as opposed to getting in over their heads and being brutalized and/or defeated by the badguys.

Patterned on the old Batman and Electra-Woman & Dyna-Girl TV series, it remembers that not only do costumed heroines actually have lives outside their costumes, which has its own demands on their time and attention: from irascible bosses who wish to vilify their alter-egos, to boyfriends who are wondering why theyve been stood up again; but also that the villains would be more focused on accomplishing their diabolical scheme rather than focusing all of their attention to a heroines downfall.  The heroines are incidental to the villains plans, and if he or she can carry it off without even encountering them, so much the better.  Meanwhile, the heroines must figure out who is involved, what their plot must be, and then stop them before they succeed.

Therefore, as an example of this particular genre, the super/costumed heroine, this is actually one of the better productions.  The actresses are attractive, the plot and characterizations competently handled, and the acting, directing, cinematography and production values are adequate for what they were trying to achieve.",1450828800,4,1651,5.2272727272727275
