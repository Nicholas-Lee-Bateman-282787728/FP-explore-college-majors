449664,5,6302280893,"Ever since I saw this film when I was 18, I've been haunted by images from it. While the dialogue does not move as easily as you might hope, I've rarely seen a movie that deals with the complexities of love in a more interesting way. If you enjoy the film version of the Unbearable Lightness of Being, you might enjoy this. Clive Owen, Saskia Reeves and Alan Rickman are all so brooding and intense... I've never seen any of them in a role with more sexual tension.",1143590400,16,465,4.295454545454546

449666,5,6302280893,"A very different sort of movie, but Alan, as always, comes shining through with his brilliant acting. When watching the movie I thought Natalie (Alan's wife in the movie) must be out of her mind to cheat on Sinclair(Alan), and of all things with her own brother! Talk about spoiled little rich girl, Sinclair & money besides! The only slow part of the movie was when the wife & her brother were in scenes by themselves, I thought anyway.

449668,2,6302280893,"For all the automatic shock factor built into this movie (due to the subject matter) I just was not impressed by this film.

First of all, I could never ""buy"" that Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen were a brother and sister.  Nothing in their manner with each other or their physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related, nor does the characters' backstory as provided by the screenwriter give any credibility to their brother-sister relationship.  They might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character flaws, because that's how the relationship came across.

Outside of the button-pushing topic of incest, I found this movie dull, slow moving and somewhat tawdry.  Clive Owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was simply annoying (reflecting her screen character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man.)  The only actors who showed any real feeling were Alan Rickman as the husband, and Karl Johnson as Clive Owen's AIDS-stricken boss.

Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film:  he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously ill, and this very fact intimidates the guy he's gone to meet.  The man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the Karl Johnson character, and in the end Karl Johnson seizes the guy's sandwich and bites it, then offers the other guy a bite, pushing the sandwich into his face, basically.  It's a little whiplash of a scene that crackles with this intelligent character's anger & pain at being trapped by this illness, which is going to kill him, while a stupid, corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally.  If only the rest of this film had this kind of energy and decisiveness!

But aside from that scene, the film dragged, and by the time Clive Owen's character was shouting his realization that he'd been used by his ""sister"" to inflate her sense of self-importance, during his final culmination scene, I was long gone, with my head nodding.

Much ado about nothing, frankly.  One star for the soundtrack; one star for the performances of Alan Rickman (what little he has to work with, he shines) and Karl Johnson.  Rent - don't buy!!",1124323200,4,2303,4.839285714285714
449669,4,6302280893,"I watched this with a strange fascination, unable to turn away but sure wanting to.  I never would have seen it if it didn't have Clive Owen in it, but I really think Saskia Reeves was great too, and would love to see more of her work.  I feel that Natalie (Reeves) was an unhappy person in general and her brother happened to be handy and easily manipulated into their affair.  When she decides to move on Richard (Owen) is having none of it.  Sinclair (Alan Rickman) is oblivious at first, but comes across quite ominus when he becomes aware what is going on.  Due to the content it is DEFINITELY not recommended for kids, but if you can remember it's only a movie and they are not real brother and sister, it's a really good movie.",1113609600,14,734,4.328467153284672
449670,4,6302280893,"One can view the brilliant and overlooked ""Close My Eyes"" on a number of levels. One could look at it as the story of an incestuous affair, the pain and despair of unquenched passion, the shattering of taboos, or the story of an unfulfilled woman searching for something about which to be passionate. Each level enriches and deepens the message of the other and creates a thought-provoking film of fiery intensity.
The film is a study in contrasts and opposing forces: Alan Rickman's controlled, restrained performance is in total contrast to the fiery passion of the two lovers and the film's direct confrontation with taboos (incest, AIDS, open passion itself)slams against polite society's prevailing opinions. The film dares us to face what is difficult and deal with it in an open and honest way no matter what the consequences, no matter what anyone thinks.
The film's solemn conclusion makes clear, however, that this shattering of taboos (what we are not supposed to openly discuss) is no easy accomplishment and involves the possibility of a breakdown in society or ""the end of the world."" But, the risk is worth it so that nothing is left hidden, so that all is out in the open, on the table, for discussion and acceptance. ""Close My Eyes""  is a powerhouse of passionate, riveting acting, Merchant and Ivory like cinematography, and incisive, perceptive writing.",1024876800,107,1372,4.991266375545852
449671,2,6302280893,"A curiously detached film about a discontented woman (Saskia Reeves) who derails her brother's (Clive Owen) life by seducing him, and how their roles gradually reverse as the affair proceeds. Overly reliant on close-ups and flattened out by amateurish lighting, the film hints at much but delivers very little.  There is scant chemistry between the three main characters, and even less plausible dynamic.  Rickman, the nominal lead, does not appear until a third of the way along and gives a performance as extraneous as the role itself.  It is as if he, and his character, wandered in from somewhere else.  Reeves, on whose character the plot hinges, fairs little better.  Alternating between sullen and enigmatic, she struggles to make Natalie believable but in the end is defeated by the simple fact that the role is as unsympathetic as it is impenetrable. Aside from taking off her clothes, or staring ambiguously into space, she is given nothing by which to make the character comprehensible.  Until far too late, dialogue in this film confines itself to the elliptical and/or banal.  The only sympathy is generated by Clive Owen, who manages to transcend the shortcomings of the script and make Richard the only operative, credible character.  Ironically, for a film concerned with passion and its compulsive, destructive aspects, where it does succeed is in its secondary storyline:  that involving Richard's job as a civil planner, and the people with whom he works.  However subsidiary these scenes, they are as plausible and deft as the rest are laborious and annoying.  What a pity there weren't more of them.  See it if you're a Clive Owen fan, or want glimpses of London's construction-boom skyline.  Otherwise, keep dialling.",1013126400,37,1739,5.124113475177305

The title soon was discontinued and the price of replacement went through the roof. I have not been able to replace it nor the other AR movies that I sent to her. I have since seen this title for sale from sellers for exorbitant prices from Arizona and wondered if they weren't mine.

449720,5,6302280893,"Although the subject matter and full nudity may be offensive to some, I found ""Close My Eyes"" to be very well done.  Clive Owen and Saskia Reeves sizzle as a brother and sister who can't keep their hands off of each other.  The crowning jewel is Alan Rickman's portrayal of the husband who knows, yet wishes he didn't.  A serious movie, but with lots of humor.  Toward the end, when Owen and Reeves straggle back to the party after their fight, sit at the table, and Sinclair (Rickman) sits between them and declares the party to be over, is perfect.",1298246400,14,550,4.47
449721,4,6302280893,"Very compelling if not entirely convincing. One thread running through this film is a metaphorical mumble on the classical versus the modern, but I think the three main characters are sketched a little too lightly to support the director's weighty intentions. The result plays rather like two different movies running simultaneously. But this work is definitely worth a couple of hours of your time. Saskia Reeves is just dazzling as the bossy sister who's as much prey to her own impulses as is her weak younger brother. Pay very close attention to the opening few seconds in which we see a group of old people (the classical) and a group of punk rockers (the modern), with a bossy little girl connecting the two groups. The whole movie is summarized in this one short scene.  Director Poliakoff does have a vision, even if it was perhaps a little blurred when he tried to marry the movie's two main themes. I watch this film occasionally to see the excellent work by Reeves, Owen and Rickman, and for the early 1990s London I lived in when this unique movie was made.",1202774400,5,1069,4.6861702127659575

Good point there. The woman seduces her player type brother... who is all over her like a rash. But in the sack with her older husband Alan Rickman she is doing all the work so to speak ... she is on top of him. No fireworks there.

The brother disapproves of her new middle class lifestyle and insinuates that her husband is dominating her, squashing her true personality. BUT when the husband works out she is having an affair, the husband gets hot. The wife decides to drop brother,now hubby is making an effort. I feel that top Billing should have gone to Clive Owen as he gets much much more screen time than Alan Rickman. Owen acted his part very well. It sort of hints at a happy ending but the woman must be some kind of kook having sex with her own brother. Will hubby ever trust her again. Will she stray again.

 I found it amusing that they track down Hubby on a Saturday to see if he is really at work and when he isn't they think that he is having an affair... he is innocently stuffing his face at a local cafe. Also the fight between brother and sister at the end was amusing.",1169769600,6,1405,4.4980392156862745

The first I saw him in was the BMW 'shorts' on the internet as 'The Driver'. Then in The Bourne Idenity in a small role as an assassin who was trying kill pumpkinheaded uber assassin Matt Damon. Then I saw Closer and The Inside Man and really enjoyed him in both of these movies. So, I decided to look up some of his other work. I came across Close My Eyes. I also like Allen Rickman so I thought I would check it out. It started out pretty cut and dry, I thought. I mean here is womanizing Clive comforting his 'female friend' who is depressed from being jilted. He tries to cheer her up and I am thinking ""ok, now they are going to realize that they are made for each other."" Well, they share a passionate kiss and then.... ""I'm sorry. You're my kid brother..."" WHAT THE ****?!!! Ok, so now I am passed the shock and this movie goes from year to year or several years of the brother and sister and their 'relationship'. Allen Rickman is the man she falls in love with and eventually marries. It is certainly a tangled web and a strage story.

449740,4,6302280893,"Close My Eyes is a mild and genteel examination of sibling incest amid the London yuppie set and against the backdrop of riverside redevelopment along the Thames. Natalie Gillespie (Saskia Reeves) is an unhappy woman of working class roots. We know this from a quick moving opening sequence of brief scenes that covers five years of her dissatisfied love relationships whining to her ambitious sexy brother, Richard, who she is distanced in age and personality. Richard Gillespie (Clive Owens), is a studly young architect, outgoing unlike his sullen sister, and able to successfully pursue his intellectual and creative pursuits. After a shared late night kiss, reality was quickly passed over as simply cuddling until Natalie rekindles her relationship with the long absent brother dearest.

Again bored, and with a new husband, Sinclair Bryant (Alan Rickman), a financial wiz who is pompous, condescending of his wife, and wealthy from family money, Natalie and Richard cross the line of social taboos with a torrid sexual affair. Richard's distraction with his sister becomes obsession while she is simply using him for excitement against a vacuous social schedule with unsuspecting Sinclair. The danger of forbidden fruit and illegal sexual thrill drives the couple to meet under the nose of Natalie's cuckold husband. Inept Sinclair is faithful to his wife and his work routine. A chatterbox of politeness, Sinclair's privileged upbring, beautiful homes, and class distance him from Natalie's insecurities. To make up for her shortcomings, she manipulates the game through her little brother, whose confidence is eroding under the spell of his sister's vacillation and sexual control.

Superior performances by Alan Rickman (Truly, Deeply, Madly; An Awfully Big Adventure) in easily one of his most sympathetic roles grounds the erotic performance of Clive Owen (Closer, Croupier), who is naked for extensive portions of the movie. They surround Saskia Reeve's performance with sufficient testosterone to overshadow the shortcomings of the secondary story line of Richard's boss who is dying of AIDS. Although meant to have social relevance, incest and AIDS seem an unlikely pairing.

Perhaps it is the notion of the unspoken pariah status of its victims, or the rightness or wrongness of the sibling's actions that is never examined in depth which makes the film unsuccessful and somewhat dated. It is a weakness surrounding what motivates Natalie's disenchantment with her perfect situation, or why Richard is so drawn to his older sister that the audience is left to ponder. Unlike a Tennessee Williams story of forbidden excesses, Close My Eyes becomes an exercise in the boredom of river front living by a menage of shallow characters.",1150934400,24,2746,5.351851851851852
449741,1,6302280893,"For a topic this edgy, this is an incredibly dull film. The actors are good enough, mind you. But they can only do so much, because the real problem with this film is the script. For the first twenty minutes or so of screen time, the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented Natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother. (You *might* not pick up on that fact at first, since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film--certainly the two *look* nothing alike.) Finally the main part of the plot begins, with Natalie just as discontented, despite being married to a wealthy and quirky-but-ultimately-nice guy (Alan Rickman, for whose sake I watched this film at all--not worth it), and with her brother seemingly happy with his life, but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister. From that point, things spiral--no, that's too dynamic a word to describe it--*mosey* out of control, with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair, the poor brother (the only particularly sympathetic character in the film) becoming obsessed with the relationship, and the worried hubby's suspicions growing (although not in the right direction). There's so much here that *could* have been fascinating and compelling, but isn't, on any level. The plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi-believable situation, scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet. This video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops--mercifully for the public--but I certainly wouldn't recommend resorting to buying it.",1150502400,9,1686,5.11231884057971

It's a good thing I'm not a flinchy old lady. The scenes and scenery are beautiful and can be distracting, which is probably a good thing because incest is not pretty, nor is it acceptable in our society.  Have to admit I did admonish them out loud several times while watching movie. They failed to heed my warnings and spun out of control.

These are good actors, but know you will see male nudity (Yaaaay!) and sister and brother roles in full-on sexual intimacy (Boooo!) and melt-downs.
