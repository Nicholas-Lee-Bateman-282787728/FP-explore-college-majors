These guys always portray themselves as super-machos and god's gift to women (barf). However, in this particular 1943 movie, Jorge has a double role, that of a macho-man (his normal style) and that of a deformed hunchback. As the ""jorobado"", it is his best performance ever, in my opinion. The story is loosely based on Paul Feval's French classic novel ""Enrique Lagardere, el jorobado"" published in 1858. Paul's novel has been presented in various movie renditions in many languages across the decades.

This is the basic story: Set in XVIII Century France, the Marquis de Cailoux offers his daughter's hand to Prince Gonzaga, not knowing that his daughter has not only secretly wed the Duke of Nevers, but also has a baby daughter! How one can have a pregnancy under their father's nose without being noticed is beyond me. A band of swordsmen is hired by Gonzaga to kill the Duke. Enrique de Lagardere decides to side with the Duke and defend him. In the battle, the Duke is killed by the Prince. However, Enrique miraculously escapes with the baby infant Aurora promising to avenge the atrocity. Seventeen years later, Enrique disguised as a hunchback to access the Duke's assassins, is killing off the band one by one. Enrique's goal is to eventually reunite Aurora with her mother and the royalty.

For those whom don't know, Jorge was a real life military official when he decided to pursue his singing career. In many of his movies, he is some type of soldier or rebel carrying a gun. He always wins the girl. He died at the young age of 42 in 1953. His rival was Pedro Infante (a more diverse and better actor). However, Jorge and Pedro did get to act together in one movie, ""Dos tipos de cuidado"" in 1953, premiering one month before Jorge passing away.

What gets me, though I have not read the novel, is that in the movie, Enrique (Jorge Negrete), whom raises Aurora (Gloria Marn) as his own child, falls in love with his 17 year old adopted daughter! Talk about dirty OLD men!!! The other problem is that in the movie, the daughter and mother never reunite, but instead, ends with Jorge kissing Gloria (whom were in real life married from about 1942 to 1952 and did 11 films together). Someday soon I will read the book for grins. This is not Gloria's best movie. But then again, she wasn't given many great roles to perform like Mara Felix and Mara Elena Marquez. Gloria's best movies were ""Si Adelita se fuera con otro"" from 1948, ""Una carta de amor"" from 1943, and ""Cada loco con su tema"" from 1939.

DVD: The version I have is by Alter Films Studio, distributed by TeleVisa. It is part of the ""!Vive Mxico! cine en 35mm"" series. The movie is in B/W as most Mexican films were until the late 1950's. Directed by Jaime Salvador and produced by Oscar Dancigers. Features include brief biographies on Jorge Negrete, Gloria Marn, Ernesto Alonso, and Jaime Salvador; a gallery of 9 pics; 8 chapter selection; and previews on 5 flicks. There are no subtitle nor dubbing options. Strictly Spanish. The movie is relatively clean with good sound. I give it an overall rating of 4 stars because of the DVD quality and being Jorge's best performance (when he is the ""jorobado"").",1345507200,2,3327,4.6053962900505905
