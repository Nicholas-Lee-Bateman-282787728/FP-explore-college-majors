8519689,5,B007NNPJG2,"Sara Driver's ""Sleepwalk"" is one of those films that go for the dream and nightmare rather than trying to create a simulacrum of reality ... the cinema being the the medium that meets best the imagery of our unconscious, a wonderful achievement and even almost 30 years after its making, it's a real treat

hopefully one day she gets a chance to write and direct another film of her own !",1394582400,2,388,4.464788732394366
