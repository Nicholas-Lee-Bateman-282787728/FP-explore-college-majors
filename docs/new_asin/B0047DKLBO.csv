4284896,4,B0047DKLBO,"This is an unusual film, a little different from what we usually see in this genre. There has been several incidents where beautiful young girls have disfigured themselves for no apparent reason. One washed her hair in acid believing it to be soap, another pushed her face into the rotating blades a fan etc. When a detective visits a stage hypnotist and one of his female friends gets up as a volunteer he gets a clue as to what is going on...but why?

The cover of this DVD, which seems to be a representation of the original poster for the movie, boasts that it introduces something called Hypno Magic. We are not told what this is but I'm suspecting that it is simply very close shots of the hypnotic eye which flickers rapidly. a word of caution here, if you look at this too closely you'll end up getting hypnotised yourself - and don't look at it at all if you are subject to epileptic fits! It really messes with your eyes.

This is one of the Warner Bros. ""Archive Collection"" which are manufactured on demand on DVD-R recordable media. Someone told me that this form of disc is not as stable as the factory discs produced in the usual way. It seems they can degrade, whether this is with use or just over time I'm not sure but if looked after the discs will probably last for many years. I don't know why Warner Bros. are producing them this way, it certainly seems to be bumping the price up. Why don't they release them in the usual way? Well, I suppose we should be glad this obscure stuff is being released at all.

Once again, it's a pity they have cropped this movie to make it widescreen. There are a lot of very close shots of faces and, as a result foreheads and chins are cut off. It makes the frame seem very claustrophobic and overcrowded. Picture and sound quality are excellent though and it's not region encoded. Some may see the twist at the end coming but I enjoyed this one. I'd give the movie five stars but because of the high price and cropping of the picture the DVD gets four.",1296518400,13,2009,4.366310160427807

4284898,3,B0047DKLBO,"Probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my childhood. They showed it on WDSU in New Orleans the same night Category 5 Hurricane Camille barely missed us. I was eight years old and already a neurotic wreck because of the hurricane. The opening sequence of a woman's burning hair (impressive special effects for their time) pretty much sent me over the edge. When I saw it available on Amazon, I had to watch it again, expecting it to be laughably bad. It was better than I remember. During the climactic hypnosis sequence I really had to resist getting hypnotized myself (I'm an easy subject and have been hypnotized myself). While it promotes several common misconceptions about hypnosis (it can't make someone levitate, think they're a dog or do anything outside of their normal behavior like washing their face with sulfuric acid), it's still entertaining if you're into B horror movies.",1421712000,2,899,4.960264900662252
4284899,4,B0047DKLBO,Not bad little film.  More of a thriller than a horror film.  Beautiful women are mutilating themselves and have no memory of doing it or why.  It seems an entertainer/hypnotist and his gorgeous assistant are involved.  If you have seen it  you know what happens but what I want to know is what is the hypnotist's motivation.  It's clear what the assistant's issue is.  Though I wish it was a regular DVD the Warner Archives DVD-R is fine quality.  Recommended.,1416009600,2,461,4.675

4284908,5,B0047DKLBO,"I hadn't seen this film in 40 years ( I'm 57) and the last time was on the old creature features show with Bob Wilkens. I was a bit nervious as my tastes have become somewhat jaded. ( after watching Saw,Hostel, etc). But the Hypnotic Eye was a  good surprise.
The acting is actually quite good for a '50s film. Most of the murder/mulitations take place off camera, which is a good thing because the few scenes that are shown are very '50s lame. But the story is excellent, the motives made some sense and overall the movie was well worth the price. It's a gem of a '50s horror picture, relax and enjoy a great movie.",1375574400,3,616,4.264957264957265

4284910,5,B0047DKLBO,"Very cool idea about a woman who hates other women that are pretty than herYes, I know, this is hardly a new concept and continues to this very day. Shes probably sitting right next to you, but this one does more than giving a look or gossips about you in the ladys room. She kills you in really inventive ways. But, I won't spoil it for you. This neat film has the great Alison Hayes in it (Attack of the 50 Foot Woman) and will be sure to dazzle the mature mind. The kids will find it boring though as there are no creepy monsters in it, but its a great film all the same.",1374105600,3,574,4.0

4284914,5,B0047DKLBO,"Congrats to Warner Bros. for this excellently remastered film!!.

Picture quality,crystal clear,sharp!.I wish all b&w movies looked as good as this.
I've seen this movie once,never in it's entirety and I was a very young child. I only remembered the ending it never left my mind...
It was well paced,it never felt long or drawn out as many older films do(I just bought this on Amazon and viewed it last week)So I'm going by VERY RECENT recall,at this point of my review lol.
Great storyline,even for this century. Handsome Jacques Bergerac stars as Desmond, a
beguiling and sinister hypnotist. Miss America contestant(1949) Allison ""Attack of the 50ft Woman""also stars as assistant/girlfriend Justine.
Well acted parts also from the overall cast in this rarity of a film the beatnik scene was interesting as well,(persons who like shows like 'Mad Men' might enjoy this as a contrast as to how people less stylish or conservative dressed in the very early 60's.)I love retro fashion and interiors in film so this was a treat!! very nice sets and visuals ect..if you like subjects dealing with the mind and lightweight terror. this is YOUR film.",1319068800,5,1143,4.984293193717278
4284915,5,B0047DKLBO,"Here we have an early sixties pot boiler which could have been part of the Poverty Row Horrors of the Forties where actors Bela Lugosi and George Zucco used to do these antics in their sleep.  Here we have French accented Jacques Bergerac as the Great Desmond posturing with sinister undercurrents as he hypnotizes beautiful women in the audience to either disfigure or end their lives. Enter Sergeant Kennedy played by Joe Partridge to solve the case as the movie audience is subjected to gory (for their time) set pieces and pre-scream queen beauties Merry Anders and the stunning Allison Hayes.  Rarely shown on television during the baby boomer Shock Theater days, this film now emerges as a truly entertaining bit of hokum utilizing the fifties showmanship gimmickery of William Castle (here we have HypnoMagic) with the pre-gore shock effects which were also used in Director Arthur Crabtree's 'HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM'-1959 and in HypnoVista no less and would come to fruition in Director Herschel Gordon Lewis's 'THE WIZARD OF GORE'-1970 and Director Joel M. Reed's unforgettable 'BLOODSUCKING FREAKS'-1975. The film sometimes tries too hard to appeal to either the beatnik generation of its time or to play up the audience participation aspect of the hypnotists acts slowing the film down but the great POV photography by Archie Dalzell and brisk direction by George Blair enhance the proceedings and make this one of the best films of this type.  Allison Hayes as Justine is worth the price of the disc alone and commands the screen in every scene she's in. Warner Archive presents the film in a beautiful widescreen transfer looking how it must have been projected back at that time and is now available from Amazon.com at a great price.  Highly recommended to all exploitation fans, this is a classic of the genre and deserves to have a better reputation.",1306972800,3,1871,4.987179487179487
4284916,5,B0047DKLBO,"I gave this item a rating of five (5) stars simply because when I first attempted to locate the DVD online, I had a difficult time finding it anywhere. When I did finally locate it, the description for the DVD stated that the quality was extremely poor. From what I understood, it was probably a copy of a copy of a copy. Anyway this item that I purchased is an excellent re-mastered copy of the original film. The quality is excellent. The movie itself is a tad bit corny but I expected that when I was searching for it. I'm sure when it was shown sometime in the sixties it was quite the horror film for that period. Finding an excellent copy earns it a five (5) star, the movie itself gets three (3) stars. The audience convincers must have added a spark of excitement back then, if they (the movie theater audience) participated along with the movie, like the movie screen audience did. Being a black and white film brings out the richness of cinematography, the special effects/make-up wasn't bad for that time period, and the hypnotic inductions were believable due to the hypnotic technical advice of a well known hypnotist named Gil Boyne.",1298246400,5,1147,4.6
8418042,2,B0047DKLBO,"This movie, which, at heart, is about mutilating beautiful women, left me feeling sleazy inside.  Alison Hayes is lovely and sinister; Jacques Bergerac is handsome and sinister; but it's just an ugly movie, predecessor to today's slasher films.",1523404800,,244,5.421052631578948
8418043,4,B0047DKLBO,Nicely produced classic B-movie,1522713600,,31,7.0
8418044,3,B0047DKLBO,"""The Hypnotic Eye"" is a fairly effective B movie about a spate of self-mutilations by beautiful women who appear to be in a trance when they do the deed. A detective tries to unravel the link between the victims and a stage show that features a hypnotist that they have all attended.

A lot of what appears in the movie is fun, although ""The Hypnotic Eye"" is barely 70 minutes long, and a lot of this is padding, featuring several needlessly long looks at the ""hypnosis""  act, as well as a very tiresome sequence set in a beatnik bar where we have to watch the whole show of beatnik music and poetry. It's a shame, because these really slow down the action. Surely it would not have been to difficult to  make the actual storyline events take up some more time.

The acting is ok, although a little hammy. The story actually has a really brutal side to it, as the methods the ladies use to self-harm are all pretty twisted. We don't witness many of them happening, but seeing somebody screaming with their hair fully ablaze is quite something for 1960 (even if it's not very realistic). Some of the ""after"" make up of the others victims is also pretty good.

If all the padding was stripped out, this would rattle along and be a lot more fun, but it would be over in less than an hour! The plot really is tiny and there is barely any quality time given to the climax, in fact events dash to the closing credits with far too much haste...a little time spent on a proper ending and explanation would have been nice. Still, it's pretty entertaining while it lasts.",1513987200,,1561,4.40625
