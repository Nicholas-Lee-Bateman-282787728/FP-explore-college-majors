and what a wonderful adventure.
 Excellent Animation CGI etc Widescreen 16.9

In the 23rd Century and the Earth has shattered into millions of
floating blocks. Water has now become the most vital source.
The Sphere an evil dictatorship ruled by Guardians are human ,but not born with Supernatural powers.
 Lena is a sage who has the Powers  along with her brother Mahad,who is on a mission to save her mother,who the Sphere
have captured,to try and learn the secret of there powers.
