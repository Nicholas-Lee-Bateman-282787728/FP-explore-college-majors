(Well, except for a major male supporting role -- that actor appeared to be trying a little too hard.) You won't easily forget the image of a man standing alone on the snowy platform.

The picture quality is good. For a BD movie I wish it was crisper, but then again it's understandable as this movie is 15 years old. The sound track didn't impress me either, but I suspect the source material for that too.

** Word of caution: There are no subtitles -- no English. no Japanese, nothing. There are no bonus material either, if it matters to you.
(Since I don't really speak the language I had to use another source for the script.)",1450137600,,787,4.383561643835616
