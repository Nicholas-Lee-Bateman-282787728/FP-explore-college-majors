8077584,5,B000ABPZ7W,Ms. Maria Lilly Delgado has done a masterpiece of directing. She caught not only the mere facts of the pope's landmark visits to Nicaragua but most of all she was able to capture and convey the feel and atmosphere of the pope's trip. Everybody who has not had the chance to observe the pope's appearances in person is advised to watch this film. The much appraised long time news anchor Lilly Delgado with this film has proven that she is a talented and promising director.,1156118400,2,473,4.576470588235294
