7907717,4,B00000F9YM,"I enjoyed it very much and it was a nice part for Alan Ladd.  I was surprised that I did not know either of the leads and
do not remember seeing them in anything else, their names were new to me and I thought both of them were so good
and sang beautifully.",1407456000,,256,3.830188679245283
7907718,4,B00000F9YM,"A musical comedy starring Wilbur Evans and Edith Fellows, this work is based upon a Gene Stratton-Porter novel that is the fundament for Adele Comandini's typically sentimental and breezy screenplay, with the diminutive Fellows successfully advancing beyond her child star phase, attracting suitors as so many fireflies in a variation of the ugly duckling motif. Light opera standout Evans, a bass-baritone, and Fellows, a pleasing soprano, perform several works from classical and traditional repertoires, including several duets, and are as well a pleasing romantic pair, with the narrative concerning several intertwined relationships of the heart, with appropriate hindrances, all settled with good taste. The lovely Fellows, only 17 when this was filmed, fetchingly portrays a girl of the same age fulfilling duties as Cupid while gradually hoeing her own beaux, and there is competent support from a cast that includes Alan Ladd, Jacqueline Wells, and Judith Linden, with a particularly fine performance by the seldom-seen stage trained Marian Kerby as an Irish housekeeper/cook.",1169337600,3,1085,5.662576687116564
7907719,4,B00000F9YM,"The fourth essay at converting Geneva (Gene) Stratton-Porter's most popular novel for the screen, this version conflicts markedly with the original story while yet managing to make a faithful adaptation of the book's pre-Great War era in a visually appealing film, with beautiful southern Oregon locations standing in for the author's eastern Indiana setting.  Stratton-Porter is inserted into the scenario as the ""Bird-Woman"" of the Limberlost Swamp region, here played sensitively by Joanna Cassidy, and the naturalist writer's endeavours with camera, notebooks, and glass photographic plates is accurately rendered, even to a mention of her watercolour tinting for illustrations in a published volume of nature studies, but there are significant alterations in the characters of Elnora Comstock (Heather Fairchild) and her embittered widowed mother Kate (Annette O'Toole) that result in flaws of logic surrounding their actions.  Since this product comes from Feature Films For Families, it was possibly deemed discreet to eliminate the important reference to Elnora's father's marital infidelity, but nothing is provided here to replace it in context, while the omission of the neighbouring childless couple, the Sintons, with their supportive counsel of Elnora; and of Phillip, beau of the young farm girl, are unfilled voids.  The dramatic act of Kate that results in a climactic clash between mother and daughter is weakly altered and Fairchild's sporadic Valley Girl diction and mannerisms are not harmonious with O'Toole's more accurate dialect, especially since the two have lived only with each other since the girl's birth 16 years prior, but Fairchild nicely interprets Elnora's struggle to balance her desire for self-improvement with her loyalty to her mother and to their tax-endangered farm.  Direction is pedestrian, and a minimalist score is nonspecific, but the sets and costumes are splendidly crafted.",1108166400,,1923,5.643598615916955
