8541471,2,B009H3LPBO,"This is a 4 DVD set with an 116 page book that houses the discs inside the front cover.  Each disc is about 52 minutes long and are region 0 discs. The book is an ugly orange color and is an odd size.

The book is made up of 9 interviews with the same people highlighted on the discs, so a bit redundant.  There are some nice black and white photos included and a few color photos (some are a little fuzzy).

Although the video includes images and audio clips of the band, this is an unauthorized product so there are absolutely no Beatles' musical recordings included.  They did have a couple of musicians, one at a keyboard and one with a guitar, talk about the songs, but outside of the guitar player running through the chords of ""my guitar gently weeps"" there are no clips of the band or released or unreleased music.  In fact, the music that accompanies is some horrible Beatle-like music that really takes away from the overall experience.

The interviewees were pretty lame as well except for Norman Smith, the sixth Beatle as he proclaimed.

There were some slightly interesting moments, but not something I will watch again and the book will not likely be opened again, except maybe to look at the pictures.

Overall, an unnecessary book and DVD collection, fortunately, it was not pricey.",1358640000,6,1299,4.588744588744588
