1248362,4,B000021Y78,"I first saw this on TV years ago and it has held a fond place in my memory. When I finally found it on Amazon I was delighted. The movie was as enjoyable as I remembered. Timothy Dalton is a delight to watch with his good old boy Southern accent and a bit over the top portrayel of a corrupt lawman, so believeable, at least for this Aussie anyhow. James Belushi wise cracked and sneered to great effect. Don't buy this expecting an intricate plot, rather buy it with a mind to spending an enjoyable 90 minutes being entertained. I only have one gripe, not with the movie itself but with the information offered at sale. My copy was not a widescreen version but a full frame one. Perhaps this is a minor gripe [you be the judge of that]. It did however detract from the overall enjoyment.",1358812800,,788,4.331081081081081

1248364,3,B000021Y78,Timothy Dalton as a redneck?  Give me a break.  Worst casting I ever saw.,1236297600,,73,4.142857142857143
1248365,2,B000021Y78,"Lots of shooting. Two black guys. Two Brits (one playing a Southern sheriff). One fast-talking con. One backwoods SOB who has a lucrative drug operation. They all chase each other all over the place, shooting and killing and stuff.

That's about it.",1232582400,,249,4.928571428571429
1248366,3,B000021Y78,"Made Men (1999)  is two steps away from being a one-dimensional, lethan shoot
'em  up action movie, adrenalin and caffeine packed;  saved from that perilous
classificaton by the sense of humor of the actors, the  charisma of the cast,
the  chemistry on the screen, and sense of maturity overall in the acting.

The work clearly succeeds in taking the viewer in a time and space displacement,
to a small town called Harmony, in the Mid-West USA, where agricultural
properties are immense, and fertile. The psychological portrayal
of a small farm community, made up of perhaps 5,000 people, almost all farmers,
moonshiners and laborers, is convincing, despite minimal.

The marketing of this movie, suggests a theme related to the Sicilian Mob
or its legacy, or even, of the underworld. Yet, that is 180 degrees from the
real content of MADE MEN, as it has no European  or Sicilian legacy, and no
sophistication shown in terms of ""organized"" subcultures, in the sense of the
the known NYC Families, whatsoever.

Those who financed this movie, wanted entertainment, and hired people who
excel in that aspect, and they professionally succeeded.

The quality of the filming - essential - is beyond reproach, with crisp,
focused, well edited sequences, coupled with panoramic wide-screen images that
are pleasing to the eyes, in terms of viewes getting a feel for the town, the
time  and place of the action.

The special effects, are fantastic and incredibly real,  which is remarkably
impressive for the otherwise mundane places where those  occur, such as in
barns and around a farm. Still, those  spectacular special effects  could have
been improved, had more  attention to detail been done. For  example, the
wipeout of the police officer's car, later shows bald, cracked, worn tires - who
believes the PD doesn't fund yearly tire changes on the entire fleet ?!
Watching Timothy Dalton, playing a Sherrif in a redneck county, is a treat in
itself, with a stereotypical tough, no-nonsense approach, yet subtle and
laughable in the  euphemistic brutality which with he enforces the law in
thatcommunity, going beyond  lawful boundaries, as he gets involved with a
remarkably charismatic woman, played by  Vanessa Angel,  in trying to seize the
nest egg  for himself, from a criminal, played by Belushi, .

Jamie Harris plays the Australian anarchist, in the spirit of the Sex Pistols
musical tradition, a low IQ,  short tempered small time criminal, bringing some
color to the crew, some contrast,  deliquency and globalism to it.

Carlton Wilborn is reminiscent of Wesley Snipes, who could have played the part
to perfection, surely, yet ...  too small and insignificant a part for that actor.

Michael Beach's presence, perhaps underestimated, is a kind of role model for
those viewers, who want to see the Black man here, as being the only relatively
honest  person among the gang, most who are out dealing  lies and building
houses of mirrors, in order to get a final grasp on $12 million of Mob cash,
until his status as an undercover FBI agent is settled.

The actors and script writers go out of their way to mix comedy with the hard-
hitting hand to hand combats, etc

Clearly, more could have been done in the soundtrack department, as  its
inconsistent, with some moments, effective Ry Cooder-like slide guitar  while
other times, synth TV stereotypical audio, (dime a  dozen audio)  is played

Realistic elements are brought to the forefront, such as gangs running moonshine
operations, in this case of amphetamines) and other action scenes, such as knife
and physical blows, bloods packs  going off (though minimal),  seizing the the
Sherrif's vehicle, etc makes for a very good action movie for this type of
audience.",1213747200,,3728,5.027777777777778

To add to it, Vanessa Angel is always a sight to see and Belushi (just as Will Smith) has to put some of his comical wit throughout the flick! After being placed in the Federal Witness Protection Program, Belushi starts making plans with wifey Angel and some stolen bucks($12 mill) until the feds, the cops, the mob and some backwoods buddies start coming after him.

1248370,3,B000021Y78,"The only reason I bought this movie is because of all the hype around it(Richard Donner and Joel silver produced it).  These guys have done some of the best action movies to date(The Matrix, Lethal Weapons).  So I couldn't resist seeing this movie.  However this was a entirely differnt  type of movie. The acting was good, and the story was decent, but don't be  fooled by the hype around it, there are only two big shootouts in the  entire movie, which was disapointing coming from Donner and Silver. There  wasn't even a big action scene between the villian and good guys. You would think they could come up with a better climax!  Any how the movie is entertaning  and is good enough to put in your action video collection. P.S. This movie  has great picture quality and its anamorphic widescreen!",955756800,5,800,4.65

7915185,4,B000021Y78,"This was a typical action movie and it had all the pieces to keep me entertained. James Belushi just seems to not be acting. He seems to just be in a pickle and gets out. The destruction in the movie seemed somewhat real. They did not blow up 10 story buildings leaving us to wonder who is going to pay for the millions of dollars in damages.

The action was good and the plot was just fine and the directing was just fine and the movie just kept rolling along. It was a pleasant movie to watch and I will watch it again. It may not have had the clever plot of ""Taking Care of Business"" but the plot was very good and I would rate the movie a solid 4 star and Taking Care of Business a solid 4 1/2 star.

I want to be entertained. The Predator, Leathal Weapon, Under Siege, Tin Cup, I love Trouble, and The Cutting Edge are my 5 star movies.",1389398400,,841,4.029940119760479
