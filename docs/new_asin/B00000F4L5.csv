1202438,4,B00000F4L5,"Sgt. Jake Martin is speaking to his new partner, Insp. Leo Larsen; trying to convince him how important this investigation is. Inspector Leo Larsen is leery:

""Sgt. Jake Martin SFPD: Evans was working the Teresa thing on his own time. He's killed on the same bus with Gus Niles who's looking for a grease gun that happens to be the weapon used.

Insp. Leo Larsen SFPD: And then his girlfriend winds up dead on the floor with the needle... Jake, you realize what you just did? You do it to me all the time, now you heard what the man said upstairs.

Sgt. Jake Martin SFPD: I heard him, I was up there, he's a nice man, he shoots in the low 80s, but he plays too close to the vest.

Insp. Leo Larsen SFPD: Then what are you laying all that crap on ME FOR? WHY DON'T YOU STOP IT FOR ONCE? That's YOUR personal hang-up, it does NOT happen to be mine!

Sgt. Jake Martin SFPD: Can't you see it?

Insp. Leo Larsen SFPD: I see one thing, I see why you're such a good cop, and one reason only, because you're so screwed up otherwise. You're beyond human belief, you understand that? You've got nothing else, no personal life, nothing!

Sgt. Jake Martin SFPD: All I'm asking you to do is help me tail a guy for a few days, its routine!

Insp. Leo Larsen SFPD: IT IS NOT ROUTINE JAKE, GODDAMMIT, IF THE BOSS SAYS FORGET IT!""

Nine people in San Francisco get on a bus, one leaves alive. The

living one takes with him a ""greaser"", some sort of sub-machine gun that he used to kill the other eight. Why? What is this all about? That is what Sgt. Martin wants to know. One of the eight is his dead partner, who was supposed to be on vacation. Jake Martin( Walter Matthau) is obsessed with this case, and will not rest until he finds the answer. Enters (Bruce Dern)Insp. Leo Larsen, his new partner. This is Leo's break, up into the big time, but his partner doesn't talk much, and it drives him crazy.

 Sgt. Jack Martin is ""melancholy, bordering on depression, overwhelming him because he suspects he may have lost his partner as the result of the two-year-old case he failed to resolve."" Thus ""The Laughing Policeman"" is a play on words. This case takes us into the underground of San Francisco in the 1970's. Fuzzy, high hair, hippies, bright suits and a tamer life than we know now. The investigation is ""right on"", and the clues and lack of clues bring them to many stops along the way. All of the clues are looked at carefully, and all of the leads followed up. The criminal elements are all interviewed. The loves and the outlaws are interplayed with junkies and the motorcycle mamas. These detectives are real and play the part, they are depressed and worried and sometimes hate their job. Sgt. Martin has been in this business for a long time, and the unsolved case of a few years ago has now come full tilt. There is the requisite car chase in San Francisco up the hills and around the sharp corners. Walter Matthau has stepped into his second detective role, and at times it seems as if he is reaching for this character. Bruce Dern plays his character with charm and determination.  The scenery is magnificent and the city comes alive.  This is the beginning of the detective series that we have seen so many times on TV. ""The Streets Of San Francisco"" it is not, but almost as good.. Recommended. Prisrob",1129334400,15,3304,4.395081967213115
1202439,4,B00000F4L5,"There is absolutely nothing funny about ""The Laughing Policeman"", director Stuart Rosenberg's ultra-serious, ultra-violent police procedural/character study from 1974.  Actually, that it's a hard-boiled police thriller is apparent five minutes in, when a lone gunman machine guns an entire city bus full of passengers to death and disappears into thin air.  Enter foul-tempered homicide detective Lt. Jake Martin (Walter Matthau), whose anger intensifies when he realizes one of the victims is his off-duty partner.  He's in even less of a good mood when he's paired with affable, sympathetic new partner Leo Larsen (Bruce Dern, in a rare ""straight"" role).  The rest of the film follows their search for the killer, which leads them into some pretty unsavory places in and around San Francisco.

""The Laughing Policeman"" isn't so much a police thriller as a procedural, and a very good one at that.  There is very little action, and most of the tension comes from Martin and Larsen's prickly relationship.  And gay viewers may be offended by where the crime ends up, as the San Francisco gay scene is shown in an extremely negative light.  That said, there's something special to be found in any movie that relies on sheer acting from its lead and supporting cast, which includes Lou Gossett and Anthony Zerbe as fellow cops and Cathy Lee Crosby and Joanna Cassidy as two women who may have clues to whodunnit.  And the last fifteen minutes are absolutely hair-raisingly suspenseful.

I'll say no more about this excellent thriller except to say that the DVD is presented in an excellent color transfer and in the proper 1:85:1 aspect ratio format, unlike the unfortunately botched release of Matthau's other stellar 1974 crime thriller ""Charley Varrick"", which is dumped onto DVD in a fullscreen transfer.  Unfortunately, the only special feature is the original theatrical trailer, which is incredibly dated like most trailers of the era.

Thrill seekers may want to look elsewhere, but those in the mood for an intelligent, atmospheric thriller may find what they're looking for in ""The Laughing Policeman"".

1202441,4,B00000F4L5,"The Laughing Policeman is anything but funny, although it does contain some very funny lines (like the title of this review) and some humorous situations. However, the eponymous Laughing Policeman is a grim, mirthless Walter Matthau who is investigating the death of his detective partner along with seven other people in a bus massacre. The movie unfolds as a police procedural unlike any other since, with extensive examination paid to the smallest detail. This may sound boring, but it's not. Under the steady direction of Stuart Rosenberg, the proceedings are both compelling and suspenseful.

This movie is one of the most realistic at depicting real gritty police work, which usually does comprise hitting the pavement and trying to shake out information from the demimonde on the streets. Bruce Dern is outstanding as Matthau's new hothead partner, and Lou Gosset is another standout. Matthau of course steals the movie with his hang-dog expression, laconic delivery, and the occasional violent outburst. When delivered, Matthau's angry brutality is shocking and unexpected from this actor we normally associate with comedies.

The 1970's saw the film violence floodgate open, thanks to Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, Dirty Harry, and Straw Dogs. As a product of the new visceral '70's, this movie is very graphic and very violent, especially the opening scene. There is also some strong language, which surprised me for an early '70's movie, as profanity would become more mainstream in mid-to-late '70's flicks.

With the above caveat, by all means see this movie. It is a fine example of the police procedural, a great performance by Walter Matthau, a slice of 1970's urban graphic violence and language, and an interesting flashback to a pessimistic era not unlike our current time. As time passes, it's striking to note how little has really changed.

P.S.: This movie has no extras whatsoever, and is priced accordingly, making it very affordable.",1110240000,54,1963,5.222222222222222
1202442,4,B00000F4L5,"this sullen, violent police drama is as detailed an investigation as you will find on film.  the opening scene of the laughing policeman is extremely tense, and sets the tone for a dirty harry style flick that delivers one of matthau's moodiest performances.  basically, a mass murder takes place on a san francisco bus and we find out that a policeman was one of the victims.  he turns out to be matthau's late partner.  bruce dern is assigned to the case to work with matthau to find out why this SFPD decetive was on the bus in the first place.  Their subsequent relationship is a play the standard, portrayed in the laughing policeman as ""mute cop/bad cop"". so, teams of gritty cops (a young lou gossett) meander through the roughest neighbourhoods of san francisco bullying pimps, pushers, hip drag queens and sidewalking street-wheelers in an attempt uncover what turns out to be a very complex underworld fraternity.  The purpose (seeing as this plays as a matthau character study), to quell Matthau's melancholic contribution to this Dirty Harry spin-off.  It is more violent and much more precise than Dirty Hary but not as entertaining.  A must see however for all matthau fans.",1087776000,8,1188,4.875621890547263
1202443,3,B00000F4L5,"Walter Matthau's first truly dramatic role of the 1970s after his years in comedic fare, The Laughin Policemen, despite its title, is anything but humorous.  Matthau and Bruce Dern are partners investigating a brutal massacre on a bus.  Dern, as Matthau's young partner, displays edginess in his doubts about his older partner's hunches, but he listens, and Matthau's hunches prove correct.  Dern's performance is good, but constantly getting in the way is his mustache, what has to be the gayest such in filmdom, a mustache that makes that of Ron Burgundy look restrained.

A series of dead ends eventually leads to a pivotal clue, and the two cops' main suspect becomes a ""fruiter"" businessman whop was cleared of a murder several years earlier.  Because he knows the suspect, Matthau knows how to get him to tip his hand, but he'd better hope Dern can keep up, as Matthau maneuvers to get himself cornered with the killer on a city bus.",1021939200,4,939,4.84375
1202509,3,B00000F4L5,"Good film but lacking SDH as many new BD releases of older films are, especially those from Kino Lorber.  The original DVD has subtitles so if you have a hearing loss get the DVD.  This BD has good picture quality (for such an old film) and good sound.
The film itself is a period piece and a good example of 1970's film making with nudity and language that all these films seem to embrace simply because the times allowed for it.  You get to see 1970's San Francisco with the nudie bars and girls with silicone 44DD busts, all the street crazies and even the Hare Krishnas.  There is a massacre on a bus, a shootout with a sniper and the required car chase through the streets of San Francisco.  Walter Matthau is a detective with a semi obnoxious new partner (Bruce Dern).  He has no home life (another staple of the 70's, alienation) his kids and wife don't respect him and he is dead to caring anymore.  This was probably explored in the novel but just skimmed over int he film.
The acting is good, the plot is not top notch but worth a watching.",1485820800,2,1050,4.326530612244898

1202516,4,B00000F4L5,"A little confusing, but surprisingly adult for the early '70s. Leaves a few things unresolved, however; was the killer a psycho to start with, or did he lose it from being followed -or as is hinted- did he go insane due to the threat of being outed as gay? Did Bruce Dern actually go on a ""date"" with gay nurse Johanna Cassidy? Did Matthau ever confront his 15-year old son after seeing him attending a live sex show in a seedy North Beach theatre? And why was Matthau so possessive of his partner's girlfriend (Kathy Lee Crosby)? But these are minor quibbles in an overall fine police

1202549,4,B00000F4L5,"I began as a cop in LA in 1971 and I've gotta tell you, The Laughing Policeman is top notch from start to finish.

I'm not going to echo a lot of what's already been said.

But pay close attention to the SWAT take down of the crazed veteran.  It's very well done.  Perfect?  No.  But remember that this was early in SWAT's fleshing out.  Mistakes were often made and lengthy after action reports were made chronicling the foul ups which yielded today's precision.

The acting is superb, the pace is relentless, the chemistry fantastic.  And watch for Joanna Cassiday in an early role.

A Bullitt?  No.  But few are.  Of this genre try The Seven Ups with Roy Scheider, another great similar period piece on those strong men who do violence on our behalf to keep us safe while we sleep in our beds.",1467331200,3,796,4.406896551724138

  I read the book version recently, and that encouraged me to buy the film. I'd rate it a three, even though I was expecting a little more out of it than I got, it was still entertaining.
  The book, which I recommend to all and any detective book fans out there, was set in Stockholm and was all Swedish in storyline.  I realize that some changes have to exist to make a book a movie, and I actually agreed strongly with one of the changes.  Having the hostage drama 20 minutes into the film, where the shooter was shot and then discovered NOT to be the bus shooter, added some much needed excitement during the course of the investigation.  It's one thing to read about a slowly developing investigation, it is totally another thing to experience it on film! I Thank the producers of this flick for not going that route.
  I had to get used to Bruce Dern's character as detective Larsen, oh he played it well, maybe a little too well, but , ya know, that's Dern, he always takes a little getting used to!
  Another change delt with the ultimate bad guy. They simplified it for the movie, as compared to the book, and perhaps that's fine, but they should have left the character as a minor media person, also I liked the bad guy's explanation as to why he killed. Too bad they couldn't have left that in the show somehow.",1407715200,2,1569,4.335616438356165

1202731,3,B00000F4L5,"A native Bay Area resident, I love to watch movies filmed in 1970's San Francisco.  The Laughing Policeman offers a chilling premise of eight passengers gunned down including one cop on a MUNI bus with Matthau and Dern as the two detectives charged with the task of investigating it. Quite graphic in nudity and violence for it's day, what follows is an interesting police procedural that recalls some very strong similarities to Peter Yates' Bullitt made in 1968; for example, scenes on uncompromising realism in SF General Hospital's emergency room as doctors and nurses attempt to revive one of victims from the shooting massacre. From then on the film seems to meander from suspect to suspect without much resolution or direction as each lead Matthau and Dern uncover provide yet another red herring.  The film is punctuated with a few tense moments in the middle, but action fans will be disappointed with the car and bus chase on the Embarcadero (circa 1973) that pales in comparison to McQueen's tense and edge of your seat Mustang vs. Challenger duel in Bullitt (1968).

Marvel at Bruce Dern's remarkable range in this picture as a optimistic and happy-go-lucky detective who is involuntarily partnered with the sardonic Matthau who is obsessed with the case and dealing with a broken marriage.  It's quite a change from Dern's typical characterization as a psychopath in most Westerns and other dramas he's been in. Matthau's lifeless performance is clearly a disappointment, and he delivers his lines as if he'd rather be somewhere else. Supporting cast Joanna Cassidy and Cathy Lee Crosby, with the exception of Lou Gossett Jr, and Val Avery (a staple from Peter Falk's original Columbo) are wasted in this police drama which begins fairly strong, retains a very slow middle, and carries with it a predictable and somewhat unsatisfactory conclusion.",1361836800,2,1860,5.088524590163934

Unfortunately the actions of the main criminal are a bit far-fetched, i.e. committing the initial crime: Not a real good reason for doing what he did; and then later, attempting to do it again. I don't know what was kept from the original material. It's an interesting time killer.",1348444800,,375,4.696969696969697

This Hollywood version of The Laughing Policeman however, is SHIT! All the worst clich&eacute;'s of american film - over and over again.
Walter Matthau as Beck is a disaster; grumpy, mumbling - and hardly able to walk. And what on earth is he chewing at through every single second of the movie - even when he is having coffe?",1347667200,2,607,4.780952380952381

1202777,1,B00000F4L5,"After having read the novels I was looking forward to seeing this story on film. The story is based on a series of ten novels written by a Swedish couple, Maj Sjowall and her husband Per Wahloo, in the 70's. This is an extremely well written and timely series of novels that are considered the parents of the police procedural novel. I read this series and immediately began a re-read because nothing I tried to read afterward was as satisfying, everything pales in comparison.

I was extremely disappointed in this movie version, In typical hollywood fashion everything having to do with sex was exaggerated and raunchy sex club scenes were thrown in to make it even raunchier than necessary. I couldn't even watch the whole movie and threw it in the garbage in disgust. This is not, in the least,  a fair representation of the novel.",1274313600,7,835,4.712328767123288

1202781,2,B00000F4L5,"The film begins in a transit station. A man makes a call from a telephone booth. [Remember them?] Another man watches and follows him. They get on a bus, a car follows them. Two more passengers get on the bus. A submachine gun sprays bullets! Then the credits show over the scenes. One passenger is barely alive. The police investigation begins. [They don't use rubber gloves.] One of the dead is police detective Dave Evans. The victims are checked and tagged. The bus is towed away. Detective Jake Martin returns home for sleep. What case was Dave Evans working on? The bodies are examined. The wounded old man said something. They find a package in Evans' desk. One is a picture of an old murder victim, Theresa a prostitute.

The detectives begin their investigation. Can they find a lead? We see scenes of Frisco life to titillate the viewers. [The film begins to drag.] Jack Martin returns home. They investigate the leads, the old case checked by Evans. Then a crime occurs with a sniper in a house. The police invade and neutralize the sniper. [Is there a hidden agenda here?] ""Get a haircut."" Could Detective Larson use more diplomacy? One prisoner offers information for a deal. There is another scene in a residential neighborhood. [Believable?] ""Was it something I said?"" Will they enter without a search warrant? Marsha won't speak to anyone. Jack asks Leo to do a favor and watch a suspect from that old case. Could a wealthy investment advisor be a crook? [Is Leo following too close? Or is that just for dramatic effect?]

More scenes of Frisco's cultural life follow to shock and amuse the viewers. Is Henry Camarero taking chances? Will Jake Martin try something? Will it work? So there is another car chase to provide action when the film begins to bog down. Would taking a bus help? Can you believe what happens next? Will lightning strike twice? There is a solution to the murders on the bus. This film shows no fog in Frisco! Films adapted from novels are simplified and seldom as good as the book. This story was modified to push its agenda. Per Wahloo wrote his series of mystery novels to document Swedish contemporary life. You can analyze this film for its purpose.",1249603200,2,2192,4.705729166666667
1202782,3,B00000F4L5,"Gritty naturalism and Altman-esque crosstalk amid great Bay City location work inform this 70s procedural that entertains but misses the mark of being a classic.  The picture's overlong with a few too many red herrings.  Things pick up for the climax.  (Indeed, the ingenious plot could be due for a remake.)

Matthau is suitably low-key in the picture's admirably unsparing picture of the cop's home life. Lou and Bruce are along to jack up the energy.",1212883200,,453,4.921052631578948
1202783,5,B00000F4L5,"In the 1960s the writing team of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo wrote police procedural mysteries based on the cops of the Stockholm PD--a sort of Swedish 87th Precinct series without a vestige of wit or humor, hence the ironic title.  Oh, very gloomily Scandinavian!  The books were immensely successful in Europe and even managed the almost unprecedented feat of jumping the Atlantic to become best sellers in America.  ""The Laughing Policeman"" was probably the best-known book of the lot.  It is still very much in print and well worth reading today.

Inevitably the series was picked up on option by an American film studio.  In 1973, ""The Laughing Policeman"" was filmed ... with a few changes.

Ingmar Bergman may have been widely admired but he was not box office.  No US studio was going to risk big bucks on unknown Swedish actors, nossiree.  Walter Matthau was hired to play the lead detective and a young Bruce Dern to play his sidekick.  (It should be remembered that in those days Matthau was still an all-around actor, and a good one; his talent had not yet disappeared beneath his comic persona.)  If no Swedish actors, than certainly not Stockholm, a town that was presumably gloomy and dull.  (Who knew?  Who cared?)  San Francisco was neither.  That was the place!

The movie starts out with a wordless sequence which begins at what was then called the Eastbay Terminal located at about First and Mission Streets.  A miscellaneous lot of people board a small diesel bus decked out in the Municipal Railway's old green and cream color scheme that clearly bears the route designation ""14 MISSION.""  The bus wends its way through the streets of San Francisco until one passenger uses an automatic assault rifle, called a ""grease gun"" in the script, to murder everybody else on the bus.  The bus, no longer controlled by the now-dead driver, careens slowly through Chinatown, coming at last to a stop in a gentle crash.  The mass murderer, face unshown, steps off and, so far as the puzzled detectives who soon arrive on the scene are concerned, vanishes into thin air.

(Now, to any San Franciscan, a major mystery immediately appears: what in tarnation was a 14 MISSION bus doing so far off course--in Chinatown, of all unlikely places?)

""The Laughing Policeman"" was made in the era of the hugely successful Steve McQueen vehicle, ""Bullitt,"" a police procedural set in San Francisco and almost dialogue-free.  ""The Laughing Policeman"" is chattier, but not by much.  I wouldn't be surprised to find that all the dialogue in the shooting script could be contained in under ten typewritten pages.

Like ""Bullitt"" and another famous San Francisco mystery movie, ""Vertigo,"" ""The Laughing Policeman"" is both an homage to the City and a travelogue.  In ""Bullitt,"" San Francisco is an action-oriented theme park suitable for chases up and down the hilly streets.  In ""Vertigo,"" San Francisco is a place of picturesque monuments that mask old sins.  But in ""The Laughing Policeman"" the cameras dote on the sleazy underbelly of the City, familiar places in the daily slog of the natives but effectively invisible to the tourists.

I lived in San Francisco for 31 years.  I left it in 1973.  This movie exactly captures the City as I remember it.  (I visited San Francisco a couple of months ago.  With the single exception of the Embarcadero Freeway, torn down after the big 1989 earthquake, hardly a brick or a hair has changed in any of the locations that appear on the screen.)

All in all, this is a pretty good, terse, well-acted film that offers a respectable story and is at once a travelogue and time capsule.

Give it a try.  Five stars.",1168992000,7,3648,4.818035426731079

7906863,2,B00000F4L5,"Walter Matthau is a great actor. However in this film, he seems more like a set piece. His partner was shot in a bus shooting an we never really understood why. The supporting cast like Bruce Dern, Louis Gossett and Anothony Zerbe follows Mathieu's lead  makes this over explained  police drama into a farce

there is something that does not feel right ith this pitture. Mathau seem almost unlikeable in this role. Maybe he was trying for against type, but it does not work for either Matthau or the picture.. Go buy HOPSCOTCH, its a better film suited to Matthau's talents
