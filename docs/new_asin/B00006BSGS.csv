7966844,5,B00006BSGS,i origionally got this boxset cause i love genocyber and when i got it i also loved cybernetics guardian but i highly dislike md geist 1 and have not seen md geist 2 yet. in my opinion this is an amaizing boxset well worth the money for just genocyber and cybernetics guardian =),1333929600,,279,4.283018867924528
7966845,5,B00006BSGS,"assuming your not some immature kid  the stories are all easy follow. Its easy to fill in some of the gaps. The gore isn't that bad but I still wouldn't show this to a sheltered child. M.D Geist 1 is tolerable but nothing special. MD Geist 2 is much better in my opinion especially for the action and keeps your attention its worth watching. Genocyber is probably the  reason to buy this that and Cybernetics Guardian is fairly hard if not impossible to find online. But Genocyber ep 1 is great it has some holes in the plot but they are easy to fill in. Ep 2 and 3 and good but not as great as the first. 4 and 5 are nearly unwatchable for countless reasons 1 being that the gore is heavily cut out 2 the english dub is easily one of the worst Ive ever heard 3 the characters aren't interesting at all and it leaves you with a bunch of questions. Genocyber is an incomplete anime and manga gory yes ok extremely gory is it necessary yes it is the gore adds to its message which is in short War is bad and Humans cant play god. In response to kids dying in the 2nd and 1st episode  War isn't prejudice there are kids in Pakistan being trained right now to be suicide bombers to kill Afghan and foreign military last year a US Soldier shot some kid in the head while on post The drug cartels in mexico have stuffed pregnant women with coke and god knows what other drugs where their  unborn babies used to be to cross into the US. Its just reality so why pull punches and act like their isn't wrong being comited this verry second. Back to the review Besides EP 4 and 5 its one of my top ten anime s OK that's a lie my favorite it inspires me and even got me to pick up drawing. These are different  anime and worth a watch. Anime from the 90s are much better than anything of this time with a few exceptions Hellsing Ultimate(OAV), Black Lagoon, and Full Metal Alchemist to name a few that can keep up. One peace, Naruto and Bleachs popularity is respectable but they are kids stuff and are all filler anime what i mean is there are countless animes and manga which are better than whats popular at the moment. MD Geist, Genocyber, Cybernetics Guardian are targeted for a young adult audiencea not kids so if your a kid 16 maybe 17 or younger you probably won't understand whats going on due to the level of maturity required and I mean no offense to anyone Its just how it works sometimes you have to watch something a few years later to understand it. At times you have to look back and watch that one show which was ridiculed for being different sometimes its bad other times you find some gems like like genocyber and MD Geist II.",1329696000,5,2634,4.2286282306163026

7966847,2,B00006BSGS,"Wrote a review some time back on this.  I was DEAD wrong about it.  I must have been drunk or sleep deprieved when I wrote the original.  Terrible Anime, just consists of violence, ZERO story, and weak characters.

Quality of box set is good however.  Nice packaging.  However don't waste your hard earned money on this.  There is a lot of high quality Anime out there, buy that instead.  Give 'Big O' a try, or 'Akira', or 'Ghost In The Shell', anything but this 'Mecha Masters' set.

For those who read my original review of this, I am eternally sorry.  Don't drink whiskey or be sleepy while on Amazon when writing reviews is all I can say...",1303603200,2,645,4.435897435897436
7966848,4,B00006BSGS,Well i like M.D. geist very cool characters but m.d.geist and genocyber lacking store. But enough for me m.d. geist is a great action movie very much not lacking violence or blood great to watch when borde. Genocyber it good but stores off track.cybernetics is good to. it a good amount to pay for this. you could call this great action moive but poor storie line. i like it though.,1060128000,7,382,4.4714285714285715
7966849,1,B00006BSGS,"Listen up folks, don't waste your hard earned money on this set. Compiling a bunch of...movies together in a shiny box does NOT increase their watchability. These are a few of the most inane and obscenely horrible anime films out there. Bad animation, terrible writing and lackluster presentations scar every film.
Don't even bother. Save your dollars on something worthwhile like the Outlaw Star boxed set or the Gasaraki box.",1031011200,6,427,5.114285714285714
