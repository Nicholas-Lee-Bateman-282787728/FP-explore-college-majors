4153241,3,B003LL181U,"The first few series were outstanding with great characters and excellent plots, but the series has really lost it's way and I'm not enjoying the latest episodes nearly as much. Disappointing.",1375488000,12,192,5.225806451612903
4153242,3,B003LL181U,"Poor Detective Inspector Peter Pasoe (Colin Buchanan) is given little to do; it's surprising that Buchanan didn't just walk away, but he was given the chance to direct an episode (did a great job). The wonderful Wieldy is gone. Even the music is of poor quality. What happened? With Series 8, we witness a decline in the show, which is now split into two 45 minute parts, slowing down the pace. Writers and directors experiment with the format, from slow-motion shots, to slow memories being played out. The Yorkshire countryside is almost absent (except for ""Great Escapes""), replaced with dull offices. I've read all of Reginald Hill's wonderful, complex Dalziel & Pascoe mystery novels, and enjoyed the series thus far; I can't help but wonder if Warren Clarke, doing double-duty as actor (Detective Superintendent Inspector Andy Dalziel) and Consultant Producer, was under extreme pressure as to funding, with lack of project support from executives. Reviewers from Amazon U.K., such as I.J. Parnham (Moray, Scotland), reveal that viewers are also disappointed in the sea-change in the Series, as the narrative drifts further away from Reginald Hill's original inspiration.

A Game of Soldiers: David Soul guest-stars as a Boston cop, in an improbable episode that only provides Inspector Peter Pascoe some genealogy research to perform; his role becomes more and more thankless. Dalziel meets up with another old flame, who has secrets, their relationship is the most convincing aspect of this story. Dividing the show into two 45 minute parts is annoying, whatever plot there is loses the previous Series' narrative flow.

The Price of Fame: It's possible to speed through the unbearable teeny-bopper song and dance routines and ""reality show"" nonsense, without missing any of the plot. This nightmarishly bad episode is the worst thus far in the entire Series, with clowns, amusement parks, and loathsome pink jackets. Guest-star James Corden, excellent in ""The Lodger"" of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Fifth-Series/dp/B003EV6DBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series</a>, and ""Closing Time"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sixth-Series-Part-2/dp/B004QOB8R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Sixth Series - Part 2</a>, is wasted. The story also indulges in slow-motion shots and memory replays, utterly dull. Thankless for all but Dalziel, the story exploits the very stuff it presumes to condemn.

Great Escapes: The only good episode, very well-directed by Colin Buchanan (Pascoe). On a dark and story night, a kilt-wearing Dalziel is stranded on a high moor when his car breaks down. A snarling moor-beast seems to be roaming the crags, while an escaped prisoner seeks to reunite with his daughter. Dalziel finds shelter in a cozy pub, and a room to sleep off his double-shots of single-malt whisky. Thankfully, Buchanan brings out our classic Fat Andy, snoring like a walrus, kilt akimbo, scratching upon waking. Unfortunately, the plot of Part Two descends into unnecessary and improbably ugly deviance.

Soft Touch: A shoe factory is the setting for family intrigue and murder. Poor Andy is threatened with relegation to a desk job. He fights to keep his position, but finds no rest; as he says, insomnia seems to be going around Yorkshire. A serviceable episode in the series, but Pascoe's role seems to be contracting, the city-scape lacks the atmosphere of the previous story, and it's missing the us/them dynamics of Yorkshire life, depicted in earlier seasons.",1335744000,15,3644,5.705340699815838

4153253,5,B003LL181U,"The series is based on 2 characters only, from the novels of Reginald Hill. Although the series began with novel plots, since 2002 the TV crime hit has taken on a life of its own. Season 8 is 4 feature-length episodes that aired in 2004. DS Andy Dalziel, pronounced Day-el, (Warren Clarke) heads the cop team with a sour face and disposition, but also provides the occasional suspense breaking laugh. His main man, DI Peter Pascoe (Colin Buchanan) is much more new-school and systematic in sleuthing approach. Their conflicting nature has become expected to true fans. A new Season 8 cop is DS `Spike' played by Katy Cavanagh, well known star on Brit TV. All episodes have ample acting ability and guest stars, but it is the excellent writing involving multiple crimes that tend to merge into a final ending that makes this show one of the greats. The show ran from 1996 to 2007.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 episodes; each 1  hr. NO bonus.
1-A GAME OF SOLDIERS: American genealogy researcher finds death--her own. On the case is DS Ettrick, an old flame of Dalziel. Ettrick is played by Phyllis Logan who went on later and is known to the world as Mrs Hughes on ""Downton Abbey."" Is the military more involved than just being the discovery of the corpse? 2 quick soldier murders complicate the case. Multiple twists mark this case as superior intrigue. Also see Ian Pirie who played Babet in the 2012 ""Les MIs"".

2-THE PRICE OF FAME: Dalziel's heavy interrogation action gets him a forced vacation. Pascoe and Spike teem on a waterfront death. A beach entertainment center becomes the pivotal point of solving a missing girl case, multiple murders, and a diamond heist. Ricky Tomlinson (Crackers) and Mark Heap (Lark rise to Candleford) are two guest stars.

3-GREAT ESCAPES: Pascoe actor, Colin Buchanan, directs this episode where Dalziel spends a night in a local pub owned by in-laws of an escaped prisoner (an early career look at Jack Deam) now the subject of a manhunt. A pub worker dies forcing Pascoe and Spike into the investigation. Tim Healy (The Grand) guest stars.

4-SOFT TOUCH: Is Dalziel really being pushed to a desk? With little sleep he believes he finds connections to two cases. One a dead man with a 2-yr-old bullet, and second, a shoe maker back from a Russian sales trip who brings home more than a contract to the family business. Guest stars include Karl Johnson (Lark Rise to Candleford) and Kieran O'Brien (Crackers).

This set is episodes 30-33 of the total of 61 for the series lifetime. So there is more to view, next coming to Region 1

4153255,5,B003LL181U,I like the entire Dalziel and Pascoe series by Reginald Hill in both DVDs and Books.  His plots are interesting and in-depth and the characters hold your attention.,1394064000,,164,4.857142857142857
4153256,5,B003LL181U,"By 2005 ,  this show was in it's 8th season. The economic disaster of the last 8 years had yet to happen.!  The wieldy character is gone from the show and that is a big loss in many ways. He was the gay detective , why he bailed on the show at the time is a mystery.  The first story is the weakest of the set but even it's not a bad one. The series hums along and continues the same well written path of it's earlier seasons. There is less personal conflict and such in this one.  So overall the season is not as strong as past ones but it was still doing quite well.  It woutd last 3 more years and would be there for the economic meltdown.  If you enjoy this series , then you will like this set. It's pretty good.  And we have season 9-12 to look forward to.  The last two seasons were combined into one as they came out in 2008. The dvd looks good here and it's worth owning.  Only a blu ray would look better.",1393718400,,915,3.9293478260869565

4153258,5,B003LL181U,Much better than what you normally see on television.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys intelligent mysteries with an added element of humor,1387584000,,148,5.434782608695652
4153259,5,B003LL181U,I love love this series.  The characters are engaging.  The storeis tightly told.  Recommend this to anyone who likes a series where the characters continue to grow and evolve.,1386720000,,176,5.0
4153260,5,B003LL181U,"I've ordered every season and know it will probably come to an end soon.  If you enjoy British police dramas, then this series is for you.  It's worth the $.",1385510400,,157,4.2
4153261,5,B003LL181U,"Dalziel & Pascoe bring us four more entertaining episodes. David Soul shows up in ""A Game of Soldiers"" as a Boston cop and former Army commander. He's not aging all that well, but he manages to almost hold his own as the husband of the murder victim. An old flame of Andy's also shows up in this mystery that revolves around an American tourist found murdered while on a hunt for her ancestors.

The second mystery is a bit odd in that it takes place in a carnival-like environment in a beach resort. But there's nothing amusing about the young starlet's murder. Things get off to a rocky start because Andy is on a forced leave due to his behavior in an earlier kidnapping case, and the DCI assigned to work with Peter, in addition to not being a fan of Andy's, is also handling the investigation of a diamond heist. Peter and Andy may not hit it off all the time, but Peter wants Andy back on the case. There are some nice connections between Andy's preoccupation with his earlier kidnapping case and the murder of this young reality star hopeful. This episode showcases Andy's uncanny ability to solve cases regardless of his somewhat colorful methods.

In ""Great Escapes,"" the third mystery, we get to see Andy in a kilt. If that isn't enough to keep your attention, there are nods to ""The Hounds of the Baskervilles"" and mythological beasts.  When his car breaks down, Andy spends the night in a local pub; and by the time Peter arrives the next day, Andy is already involved in the investigation of a barmaid found mauled to death on a deserted moor. Throw in a man hunt for an escaped killer, and the plot really begins to thicken.

Finally, in ""Soft Touch,"" the team is busy with one dead body when the head of a dysfunctional family's shoe business also turns up murdered. Andy, who has been told that after this case, he'll be relegated to desk work, is in an even worse mood than usual. Peter is very frustrated with his partner's behavior and is  annoyed when Andy, against all reason, insists that the two cases are somehow linked. Is it really time for Andy to hang it up and stay behind a desk?

Dalziel & Pascoe is a great series, and I liked each of the episodes included in this collection. One review said that this was the UK version, but the set I received is region 1 and plays on US DVD players. Another review stated that this was the weakest season so far, but I have to disagree. I enjoyed the humor and imagination of season 8, and I think we continue to see the growth of Dalziel and Pascoe as partners and the influence of Andy on Peter's style as a detective.",1383868800,3,2589,4.428571428571429

8399707,3,B003LL181U,"While captivating and humorous, season 8 doesn't measure up to previous seasons.  I am afraid that the almighty buck is to blame in that the scenes are limited to mostly 'sets' and the more costly scenes in urban areas are few and far between.  I watch BBC series' for the scenery as much as the plots, so I feel cheated somewhat.  Perhaps the writers come more from stage productions than TV dramas?  Be that as it may, Warren Clarke is better seen in the earlier series 1-5.",1468886400,3,476,4.436781609195402
