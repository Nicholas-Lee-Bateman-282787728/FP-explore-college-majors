8427924,5,B004FMJHI0,"In LIMELIGHT, Charlie Chaplin's character is a music hall star who's fallen on hard times due in part to failing health. To be funny on-stage this man always relied upon alcohol, but after a near-fatal heart attack the liquid key to his career success can now also be the cause of his earthly demise.

Yet, we first meet Calvero while he staggers home in a state of supreme intoxication. He's not too drunk however to smell gas coming from a first floor apartment. Calvero breaks down the door and rescues a young girl who's trying to commit suicide. Thereza (Claire Bloom) is convinced that she's had rheumatic fever and is paralyzed, but the doctor tells Calvero that the girl isn't sick al all-- her illnesses are psychosomatic.

Big-hearted Calvero takes 'Terry' in and does his best to nurse her back to both physical and mental health. During one of his philosophic moments, Calvero says that like her he used to wish for death, but has now reached a point where living's become a habit that he wants to continue.

I won't reveal the next nearly 2 hours of story but worth noting is Chaplin's amazing agility and athletic strength at nearly age 63. We see him do some of Calvero's famous old routines near story's end which require much flexibility and energy, including a dancer's split that Chaplin is able to rise to his feet from unassisted and without use of his hands. It's a remakable feat for a man of any age to perform.

After a recent first-time viewing, LIMELIGHT officially replaced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MONSIEUR-VERDOUX/dp/B00017LVQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MONSIEUR VERDOUX</a>&nbsp;as my favorite Chaplin sound movie. If you haven't seen it, this one's definitely worth a look. For classic movie fans, it truly deserves a place in your home library.
