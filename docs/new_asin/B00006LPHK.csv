1785711,5,B00006LPHK,"I saw this film some years ago at a film festival, & never forgot it .  I have always  had a great interest in Patrice Lumumba, & his short rise in the Congo, as a progressive political leader. I've seen excellent documentary's on Lumumba & this well acted, & crafted film, delivers  a very intimate  look at Lumumba & his agonizing understanding of the forces that was crafting his downfall & ultimately his  demise . Eriq Ebouaney, is Lumumba  for I forgot, I was watching an actor, that's how good he is. If interested in the behind the scenes  machinations  of one of Africa's most promising young  leaders of  Africa's independence  movement , from colonial  rule ; you will not be disappointed with this gem of a film !",1457481600,2,725,4.534883720930233
1785712,5,B00006LPHK,"I loved this film! I learned a lot. It is so tragic that Africa (as many of you know very well, is the poorest continent in the world) is so rich in natural resources and yet the people are so terribly oppressed, exploited and butchered, and so many other things that don't come to my mind right now. I loved the vision of the real Lumumba in terms of Pan-Africanism. I think one of the heroes in my island's history, Eugenio Maria de Hostos, had a very similar vision: he proposed a coalition for all Latin American countries (I am not sure if this coalition included Caribbean islands as well) (This is the information I have, but I'm not 100% sure that it is right).

The reasons for the friction between Lumumba and the leaders of Katanga Provence  are never well explained in the movie (they are apparently complex even if you do know them) . Lumumba obviously has political enemies, but the reasons behind the enmity are convered briefly or not at all.

1785737,5,B00006LPHK,"An entertaining and well-done movie. A look at a slice of African history that few Americans are aware of. I can remember reading of these events when they were taking place. Of course, we only got what the US controlled media allowed us to read, which was not much. I can remember that what was going on in Congo seemed to be very confusing.  The media had Lumumba painted as communist.  I remember trying to sort out who was the good guy: Lumumba, Tshombe, or Mobutu. They were all in the news.

This is a must-see for anyone with even the slightest interest in 20th century decolonization, the past of the D.R.C., or the personal life of the title character.

The movie offers an excellent overview of the decolonization of Congo. Even for someone who knew next to nothing about the Congo's gain of independence, I was able to follow along quite well (with English subtitles, of course!).
Secondly, it kept me interested and glued to the screen. It is not just a historical film, it is a film about humankind and our often greedy and wicked nature. It brought up powerful questions and left me a different person.
Thirdly, as a foreign language film, it is great for the budding French student.
Without subtitles I was able to pick up French phrases and gain a basic understanding, which was very exciting for me!
Beautiful film.",1339718400,,804,4.7913669064748206
1785773,4,B00006LPHK,"When Belgium granted the Congo independence in 1960 it ended a period of colonization which saw the huge territory ruthlessly exploited (at least during the first decades of European rule) and badly prepared for self-rule (Belgium maintained the civil service and the gendarme was officered solely by Belgians). Once independance was granted the Congolese attempted to run this huge country, which was as big as western Europe, with few educated people and no previous experience at democracy. This film looks at the short administration of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who tried to lead the country during the first few months.

One of the things I liked about this film was the way the director was able to get the ""feel"" of the period... first-rate locations shots and period costumes really establish this film in the early 1960s. And the performances by the actors were very good as well. However, the film did little to explain the events which led up to Lumumba's overthrow and the subsequent civil war. Indeed, the MNC (Lumumba's party) made a lot of promises to the populace which could not possibly be met. In one scene several Congolese soldiers appeal to Lumumba prior to elections to improve their lot. Later, soldiers break into a cabinet meeting AFTER independence and demand the removal of Belgian officers, promotions, etc. The fact was that the Force Publique had been undermined by the promises of politicians (Lumumba among them) and that this collapse had ripple effects which would be felt long after Lumumba was gone. It was no coincidence that the strongman who emerged was Mobutu, who was able to rebuild the Force Publique as a national army, the ANC. When an impasse developed between Lumumba and President Kasa-Vubu Mobutu was the the only agent of order in the Congo. He became dictator of the Congo through 1997.

The director clearly wants you to believe that Lumumba was better than that, but if he did not become a dictator (as happened in virtually all of the newly-independent African states) he would have been bucking the trend. No elected president of this period ever stepped down voluntarily or stood for reelection. He was also a leftist, which is undeniable, and was certainly leaning towards having a Soviet presence in his country when he was removed from office. Still, as the story of a man who was in over his head, it is a good movie.",1334707200,,2385,4.900990099009901

1785793,3,B00006LPHK,"I cannot see this DVD on my TV, it seems that the problem is about the format of the DVD. The DVD must have been formated for Region 1 instead of Region 2 which correspond to european countries such as Spain.",1286150400,,208,4.097560975609756
1785794,5,B00006LPHK,"I loved this movie, I have watched it over and over, there is so much to learned from the strenth and character of the actors.  I loved the book and now I love watching the film.",1280707200,,178,3.9444444444444446
1785795,1,B00006LPHK,"Raoul Peck seems to be have been troubled by the facts of his subjects life so he made up his own. This film is basically untruth from beginning to end. Its wishful thinking and self-deception as history.

Patrice Lumumba became a mythological figure in death that the real man doesn't live up to. Lumumba was a congolese politician who was handed power by the departing belgians and within days had destroyed the country. In succession, he triggered an army mutiny which he then tried to suppress by an open appeal to racial violence and when that didn't work, he called in a multinational force whose members then set about buying groups of politicians. Lumumba was removed from office while planning his next step of taking the country into civil war.

Contrary to the view in the film, it was not the colonialist conspiracy that wanted Lumumba dead, it was almost every player in the politics of Congo that wanted him dead. Raoul Peck ends up reinforcing the old ideas of Africans as naive child-like victims of the evil international conspiracy. Therefore the reasons for Lumumba's death cannot be found inside among the people of congo. It has to be a conspiracy.

It was not any vision of a united Africa that doomed Lumumba. It was that he was a bad leader who managed to lead the country into ruin within days of taking power. The film is an exercise in self-deception among those who see the ""big man"" as the solution to Africa's problems.",1203120000,7,1449,4.696850393700787
1785796,5,B00006LPHK,"Raoul Peck's political thriller vibrates with tension, as we see how Lumumba's rise to prominence was punctuated by some extremely rough handling by the prior regime, and that once in power, his respite from such brutal treatment would be tragically short. Ebouaney is electric as the fiery, defiant Lumumba, a man whose worst sin was not sensing and neutralizing the treacherous forces surrounding him. This tight, involving film packs a wallop in reviving a disturbing chapter in Africa's turbulent history.",1184889600,4,509,5.375
1785797,2,B00006LPHK,"Despite what it says in the Amazon.com advertisement, this DVD is NOT the full 180-minute version of ""Lumumba.""  In fact, at 109 minutes, this version is actually six minutes shorter than the ""Special Edition,"" (also Region 1), that is listed at 115 minutes.  The sleeve for this version also claims to have an English-language soundtrack, but it does not.  It does have English-language subtitles to go with the French soundtrack, however.  The sleeve for this version claims that it its aspect ration is 1:2.35, but that does not appear to be true, either--the aspect ratio appears to be 1:1.85, the same as the Special Edition.  Because the Special Edition contains many extras--including excepts from R. Peck's excellent documentary ""Lumumba: Death of a Prophet,"" it is clearly the better choice for anyone who wants to purchase a DVD of this film right now.  Ideally, however, we should press for a release of the full 3-hour version of this film, preferably packaged together with the FULL documentary ""Lumumba: Death of a Prophet.""  Now THAT would be a package worth paying extra for!  The 2 stars above reflect the several misrepresentations associated with this particular DVD release, not the film itself, which is very good, albeit in this version in an unnecessarily truncated form.",1182643200,11,1294,5.099526066350711
1785798,4,B00006LPHK,"At the least this film is a cold shower to your heart & soul, to stir & aliven your sensory skills, to the awareness of families strengthened by power of love and intense sacrifices. The unspoken ""brothers"" that laid themselves at the altar of sacrifice, knowing full well they may shortlive seeing the fruition of their convictive destiny. It brings insight to the book, ""Bloods,"" by a Cornell fellow.  Lumumba, brought me insight into the realm above my own quagmire haze of short perspective and into understanding of the price of cause greater than self.

This man was a true ""Drum Major,"" as MLK, Jr. put it in excerpt speech.

1785799,5,B00006LPHK,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  Accoring to most available literature, this movie is historically accurate. Peck is a well respected director and seems to have done a good job presenting the truth.  Lumumba is an icon in African history and he represents the hope and optimism of post-colonial Africa.  His death was a tragedy and it leads us to wonder ""What if..."".  This is an important chapter in modern African history and we are lucky that such a well-made movie has helped tell this story to the world.

PS.  Frank Carlucci's (the second secretary in the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa at the time) name is bleeped out in some versions because his lawyers pressured the film's distributors to remove all reference to him.  He of course denies involvement in the assassination of Lumumba.  Peck has stated that he has strong reason to believe his movie to be accurate.",1106611200,11,868,4.778523489932886
1785800,4,B00006LPHK,"I would recommend this film, but couched in the warning that I found it a bit hard to follow.  There are a lot of characters - the various political figures - and sometimes it's hard to keep them all straight.  It's definitely important subject matter though - an interesting glimpse into the colonial forces that shaped modern Africa and the struggles that continue today in many of its troubled nations.",1087516800,7,405,4.771428571428571
1785801,4,B00006LPHK,"Although it's quite likely that some artistic liberty has been taken with the facts, I viewed this with my ""general state of affairs of colonialized African countries"" goggles.
In that regard, it's a gripping tale that shows some of the horrible footprints left behind by colonialism mixed with other pre-existing tribal aspects of the local societies, not to mention the Cold War. That indictment is what stood out when I watched it, and it's eye-opening for those who've not lived in Africa.
Since this is a review of the DVD, and not just the movie, my only disappointment is that those of us with HDTV/widescreen capable TVs/projectors will notice the poor quality of this DVD. I watched Lumumba for the first time at a film festival a couple of years ago, and was looking forward to having a good quality copy on DVD.
Unfortunately, it's been *letterboxed* to shrink the widescreen format into a 4:3 frame. I wish they had used a true anamorphic widescreen transfer that would make fuller use of a 16:9 aspect ratio/resolution. In that sense the cover text ""luminous new widescreen transfer"" is misleading.
At least the Special Edition is subtitled, and not dubbed or censored (from what I've read of the other version), so that's one plus for this specific edition of the DVD.",1083369600,16,1282,4.858447488584475
7971887,5,B00006LPHK,"Patrice Lumumba was the first president of the Congo (Zaire) after declaring independence from its Colonial master, Belgium. He was in power for barely three months, and was assassinated by Belgian and United States forces supporting the ascendency of Mobutu Sesu Seko, who held power for the next thirty years. This movie plays like a neutral documentary, but is respectful of Lumumbas legacy, at the same time does not canonize him for sainthood.

My personal opinion is that the movie downplayed the extent of foreign intrigue and misconduct involved in Congo (Zaire)s transition. One scene shows how after independence the colonizers took property belonging to the Belgian government. Government employees can be seen taking furniture and office equipment and the like. It was actually much, much worse. Yes, they took government property with them; they took ALL government property, down to every last light bulb. They left NOTHING for the new government. American involvement was shown, but only in the later part of the movie, a scene when Frank Carlucci discussed what to do about Lamumba with other officials from Belgium and NATO. American involvement, on the other hand, occurred far earlier, and was much more involved than depicted, both in the planning and implementation for regime change. President Eisenhower and Allen Dulles had both had pegged Lamumba for assassination shortly after he was elected. The United Kingdom and MI6 were also involved, but barely mentioned.

The movie strives to be even-handed. Along with the international machinations and white bigotry, the film presents the race killings, pogroms, inter-tribal conflicts, mutinies among Congolese troops in the armed forces, and civil unrest, plus the effect all these struggles had on Lamumba personally.

The special edition contains bonus material. The director, Raoul Peck, produced a documentary on the life of Patrice Lumumba. Portions of that documentary are included in the bonus material.

Lumumba then is the best type of film. One that shows historical events with becoming a hagiography, but which loses none of the human drama of Lamumbas life.",1514332800,,2143,5.350148367952523
7971888,4,B00006LPHK,"I remember how disgusted I was a few years ago when hearing that the US colluded in 1961 with Belgium to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, the first elected prime minister of the Congo.  This film is a good intro to the human side of the freedom fighter who was violently prevented from fulfilling his mission of a Congo that was no longer supposed to be economically exploited by European and American colonial/corporate interests. The film has compelling acting and also provides background on the corrupt Mobutu who was installed after the assassination, and later proceeded to plunder the DRC (then Zaire) for the benefit of himself and outside interests.

Considering the tremendous pain and sorrow needlessly inflicted upon and suffered by the Congolese nation after Lumumba's assassination, one can only wonder if things would have been different had Lumumba been allowed to implement his mission. It is maddening to think how history could have taken a more humane turn had (supposedly-democratic) Westerners not assassinated the democratically elected leader of a formerly colonial country, just to enrich their own pocketbooks.  Must watch.  I rarely say this about a bio pic, but I wish it was longer.  I wanted to see more about Lumumba's family, his relationship with Mobutu, his rise to power, the formation of his national and anti-colonialist consciousness.  Ah well, that's what documentaries and books are for.  Please watch this film.",1505001600,2,1448,5.242424242424242
