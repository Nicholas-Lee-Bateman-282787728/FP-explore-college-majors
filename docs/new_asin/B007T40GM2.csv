5109761,5,B007T40GM2,"This 2 disc DVD set presents a pretty complete and understandable history of Queen Elizabeth II and of England. Both discs total about 4 hours with English subtitles available. Each disc is divided into 2 parts.
Disc 1 has: London Royal City. It shows the beginnings of Elizabeth's reign, her life in the war years and that of her parents. Traditions, Horse guards, state visits to London, changing the Guard, Buckingham Palace are all covered.
And: A history of the Royal Visits. We are shown royal art, the Queen at Derby, what the Queen's calendar is like, the Braemar games, a visit to Liverpool, her longevity and the future of the monarchy.

Disc 2 contains: The queen's possessions showing the Tower of London, Yeoman Warder's history, the Royal Swans, the story of Jersey, the Queen sitting for a hologram portrait and the Ceremony of the Keys.
And: Traveling - The queen's flight, the Royal Yacht, her visit to Australia and the story of the commonwealth and the future of the monarchy

The photography is beautiful. Even the historic black and white films are of very good quality. In a few places the people being interviewed speak so softly, the subtitles are needed The Queen does not speak, except in portions of speeches. She does not give interviews at all. Much of the program is history, but it is all related to the monarchy and her place in that history.
At one point, some clips are repeated and there are the usual talking heads explaining and giving opinions and people relating anecdotes about their experiences with the Queen. Nothing is very personal or revealing. It does take her history up to 2012 and the marriage of Prince William and the decision to change the royal succession.

This is a well done progression of Queen Elizabeth's reign and the history that surrounds her. Those interested in the royal family, history and anglophiles would really enjoy this set.",1356652800,10,1897,4.8307692307692305

8521725,5,B007T40GM2,"I first watched this four part sereis on PBS and really liked it a lot.  In each episode I learned a lot about what The Queen does and what she is the custodian of.  I have known that before she goes on a royal tour, it is thoroughly researched and timed down to the last second.  Even though I'm an American, I have the utmost respect for the Queen.  I hope she will have a long reign.",1371686400,3,386,3.9740259740259742
