7882386,5,6305029415,"If there is any fairness at all; one day the films of Ron Ormond will draw the same intrest, at least, as those of Ed Wood. They are as odd, passonite, funny, and enjoyable as Woods; who is really the only filmmaker to compare them to.
  ""Please Don't Touch Me"" is right up there with his best. The story of a frigid wife who can't work out her problems with her husband(Cowboy Star Lash LaRue) until She meets a dubious doctor who helps her see that the problem is her battleaxe Mother.
  There are shots in this movie the ZAZ boys would have sold their souls to have created. To put it mildly, if you have a taste for drive-in bargin basement cinema, Ron Ormond's films are must see Shlock MO VIE. Grab a copy while you can.",991008000,2,726,4.239130434782608
