1665773,4,B00005UMAV,"This program clearly has solid merit. It is very thorough and does the video does not seem like cheesey educational video stuff. Sometimes there's a few silly jokes, but nothing that would turn you away from the program. I was pleasantly surprised by the 3d illustrations -- thinking that they would be a really stupid gimick -- but they turned out to be quite useful.",1015372800,10,368,4.676923076923077

I fled to the interned to find some help, and The Rules of The Road DVD was the most impressive program I found. My daughter used the DVD, and just a few days ago, she recived her first Driver's license with a perfect score. Thank you!",1011744000,23,360,4.3088235294117645

1665780,2,B00005UMAV,"I bought this DVD thinking that, among other things, it would help me with parallel parking for the purposes of the driver's test.  The distributor's site claimed that the DVD explained parallel parking in ""a few simple steps,"" and even mentioned that there was a 3D model that could be viewed from multiple angles.  I am notorious for not having the best spatial judgment, and bought the disc assuming that it would offer some sort of fool-proof advice that I hadn't stumbled across so far.

These hopes, however, were quickly dashed when I actually watched the clip on parallel parking; in fact, my first reaction was something along the lines of ""that's all?""  The instructions expect the driver to be able to line up with the car in front of the parking space-- perfectly good advice, as long as there's a car to line up with.  At my own local DMV office, there's literally nothing in front of the parallel parking space with which to line up, so that advice is rather futile-- and I would *almost* be willing to excuse this, were it not for the fact that the accompanying footage shows a DMV office with the very same arrangement.

Similarly, the distributor claimed that there was a ""simple explanation"" for which way to turn the wheel when parking on a hill.  Simple, that is, if you can easily remember seemingly random directions by rote without getting them all mixed up; as is the case with a number of other explanations on this DVD, I would have found some elaboration on *why* the rules should be followed far more memorable than an unconnected bunch of easily confused rote facts.

But there are 3D models that might be helpful, right?  Yes, if you're one of those sorts of people with reasonably good spatial skills that can work things out from an outside-the-car perspective.  I would have much preferred to have at least one perspective showing the view from *within* the car, particularly during the parallel parking clip, so I could get just a vague idea of what a successful maneuver should look like from my own perspective.

I can't *completely* fault Jumby Bay for this release, however, because they did do something that seems to be quite a rarity on independent educational videos: namely, they actually considered the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing students by offering a subtitle track.  That alone is worthy of an extra star.",1151798400,12,2359,4.7690417690417695
1665781,1,B00005UMAV,"I bought this DVD for my 16yo son and previewed it. It is SO lame that I hesitate to even give it to him. The kids are so scrubbed and clean-cut as to be nauseating even to me. the cuts to a state trooper are largely purposeless..he sounds unscripted, COPS video where it is shot from the front seat and he never looks at the camera (he is driving while talking!) and the material he delivers has NO relationship to what they just interrupted. The questions are so general as to be obvious without any attention to the video. NOT a good effort. Save your money. ""Death on the Highway"" 30 years ago got your attention, this doesn't.",1141776000,6,631,4.3559322033898304
1665782,4,B00005UMAV,"""Rules of the road"" has two major blind spots and few minor ones. I, personally, do not like how parallel parking  (#3 Road test) was presented. It does not look comprehensive. The authors even did not mention obvious rules usually taught about parallel parking. Well, parallel parking between two pairs of construction  barriers obviously looks cute but it may not reflect real situation at the exam and especially at the street. Episode about drug/alcohol driving made ridiculously schematic. There is no definition of BAC, no particular mentioning of how different alcohol beverages may affect it. There is also no mentioning of how to avoid DWI or DWI-drug. Com'n guys! It is simple and this is very important! They even did not say anything of how regular prescribed medicine can affect driving especially in combination with alcohol. Furthermore, driving with cell phone in some areas is already illegal. The authors of the movie said opposite: it is dangerous but if you want it, it is all right, go ahead! As minor inaccuracy of this movie I would consider that they never showed steering weal in the car except a small episode in ""basics"" as well as there was no mentioning of the U-turn. Watching this movie, it is impossible to figure out there are some of the machine tools are located. I've got no idea of the location of head lights (high and low bins) hazardous lights. However, regardless of what I said, you may want to buy due to the only particular reason. I do not see any reasonable commercially available substitute for it.",1092268800,9,1545,4.848484848484849
1665783,2,B00005UMAV,"Cheesey video, bad interface, offers little instruction, tests are too easy to be useful. Save the money and go take a driving lesson from a licensed instructor instead.

1665784,5,B00005UMAV,"This was a birthday present to my daughter and it was quite a hit... pardon the pun.
I struggled with whether to give this 4 stars or 5.  The user interface (UI) is a bit clunky, but the content and instruction is worth of the 5 stars.
The DVD tries to be interesting -- and it is interesting -- although it is borderline cheesey in the process.  The important thing is the viewer won't bore easily with repetitive viewing which is important when you are getting something instructional like this.
At the end of sections, the DVD has a small quiz.  That is a good idea, but the quizes are a little obvious and easy.
I guess the most appealing thing about this is it is easily increasing her abilities while she does what she does best:  watch TV.  That helps keep insurance costs down, I guess.  ;-)",1038528000,19,799,4.364864864864865

7954754,3,B00005UMAV,"I purchased this based on the glowing review from ""Driver's Ed Guru."" The DVD is divided into sections which cover basics, city & residential driving, highway driving, safety tips for normal & hazardous conditions, and a drug/alcohol section. Most of the info is available in the regular driver's ed manual but it is informative to see some of the 3D models regarding parking, intersections, etc. The ""Virtual Driver"" interactive section provides an ""inside-the-car"" look and tests you on your surroundings (multiple choice). Unfortunately, my DVD kept freezing on the ""identify the hazard"" section so I couldn't get through the whole program. It might just be my computer though. Overall review: Good for beginners, but doesn't provide any groundbreaking information. There is an updated 2-disc version of this available now, which is supposed to have more info but I haven't purchased that so I can't comment on the differences between the old and new editions.",1312156800,2,963,5.259740259740259
7954755,3,B00005UMAV,"I checked this DVD out at my local library (along with a copy of ""The New California Drivers Test Made Easy"" and the DMV handbook) to help me study for the DMV's written and driving test. It provides the material pretty well. The target audience is younger teens in high school going for their youth permit, but can also help with young adults, adults, and seniors.

All the driving materials, laws, regulations, and driving tests are mentioned and covered. There's even a ""Show me more"" option, which goes into detail about what was mentioned with a detailed 3D diagram with multi-angle options to see it from a different perspective. Sometimes this felt unnecessary, but other cases it helped me.

Although the bit with the State Trooper on the ""Alcohol and Driving"" bit felt worn out and melodramatic. Yes, it addresses an issue that is a serious problem, but I personally know not to drink and drive, so to me it was telling me not to do I didn't plan on anyway. Even if I did, I would have dismissed it as nothing. ""Red Asphalt"" seems to be more convincing with it's true graphic nature.

The humor on this is pretty dry and cheesy, but I expected this, as ALL educational videos have bland and cheesy humor. After all, I'm not watching this to be entertained.

DO NOT purchase this DVD unless you are teaching a Driver's Ed class. After you or your child are successful with getting your/their license, the DVD is pretty much done and useless. My local city library had this DVD available for check out for no additional fee.",1253491200,2,1531,4.617647058823529
7954756,5,B00005UMAV,"This is a very, very basic road rules review DVD.  My son enjoyed it, because it was being taught by actual teenagers, not adults.  It is very basic, and I don't know if it is comprehensive enough to really help on it's own.  We purchased it in conjunction with the book, ""Crash-Proof Your Kids,"" which is supurb. The DVD alone is good, but it is hardly a ""complete"" driver's ed course.  It is a good road rules overview.",1221436800,3,421,4.358974358974359
