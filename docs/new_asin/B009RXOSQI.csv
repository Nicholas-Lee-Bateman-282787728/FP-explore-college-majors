8543979,5,B009RXOSQI,Inherit the Wind is a great story.  And with Kirk Douglas it's even better.  This is probably his best.,1424908800,,103,4.368421052631579
8543980,5,B009RXOSQI,"An TVM  adaptation of the famous Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee play inspired by the (in)famous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, where freedom-of-thought Vs. conformity was put to-the-test.  Starring Kirk Douglas as famed, fundamentalist prosecutor Matthew Harrison Brady , and Jason Robards (Jr.) as the agnostic defense-attorney Henry Drummond, who was inspired by the legendary criminal defense-attorney Clarence S. Darrow.  This Hallmark adaptation comes far-closer to the actual Broadway play than the 1960 feature-film ever did.",1415923200,2,533,5.896103896103896
8543981,4,B009RXOSQI,"Old movie but interesting to watch the makeover over of ""The Monkey Trial"".  If you're into the debate of God Vs, Evolution this might interest you in seeing a sad debate that no one really could win.",1414454400,,200,4.405405405405405
