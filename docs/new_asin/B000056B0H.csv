1397006,5,B000056B0H,"If you are a Patti fan like me, then you know that this gurl can sang!!! I've been a Patti fan since I was born (no lie) 16 years. And the 1st I saw this dvd I was completely blown away... Although the sound sucked, Patti def. made up for it with her vocals. Also, I was lookin forward to seeing Patti in her usual attire (the CrAzY hair, hott clothes,etc.), but she only changed clothes 2ce, and she kept the same hair thruout the show (BIG DISAPPOINTMENT). However, she is one of the best performers of all time... Ive seen her once, and I was glued to my seat... my fav. vocal performances include:
From a Distance
Be Yourself
Need a Little Faith (AMAZING VOCALS)
Patti Lov Medley
Never Love this way again
All The man that I need (Chills up my spine)
Release yourself (Just let it gooooo)
You Are My Friend (the song she rolls around on the floor on)
When You've Been Blessed
If You Don't Know me By Now (She kicks her shoes off on this one)
Somewhere Over the Rainbow (She Flies, She Flies)
Patti's the best... shes has soo much charisma on stage, and she's soo funny. My only complaint is that she talks WAAYY TOOO MUCCHH... its amazing that she sings as well as she does, bc if i talked that much, I would be dying by the time I had to sing ""Over the Rainbow."" But I give it 5 stars overall, vocally, one of her best!!! Patti is one of, if not the greatest singers of all time!!! BUY THID DVD, ITS A PATTI MUST!!!",1083974400,12,1420,4.167272727272727
1397007,4,B000056B0H,"Patti delivers an amazing performance, as always.  But I agree with the other reviewers that the picture and sound quality is aweful on this DVD.  Very dark and grainy picture.  Very weak sound, (I had to double the volume on my TV just to hear it).  So there are real problems with the mix.  Also, the audience at the Appolo seemed a little quite.  I would have liked to see them clap more often or give Patti more support.  But maybe they were being quite because they did not want to interupt her performance.  I would recommend the Live, One Night Only DVD over this one.",1026432000,18,575,4.3584905660377355
1397008,5,B000056B0H,"I have both of her Live DVD concerts which both happen to be recorded in New York City. The Patti LaBelle Live, One Night Only, which is her second live DVD is a tad better in my opinion as she seems more relaxed, but then the DVD Patti LaBelle Live in New York, is just as fabu! I and my husband and friends loved the both of them. You know with Miss LaBell, you can't go wrong. She could sing the incie wincie spider went up the water spout, and sound amazing! We can't wait for Miss Girl to release her next DVD live concert.",1016841600,6,528,4.038095238095238
1397009,5,B000056B0H,"If you've never been to a Patti LaBelle concert this is as close as you'll come to getting the full experience.  Patti throws down in this concert like you wouldn't believe.  Singing songs from her standards ""On My Own,"" ""If You Asked Me To,"" and ""Lady Marmalade"" to cover songs of Aretha Franklin's ""Ain't No Way"" and Whitney Houston's ""All the Man That I Need.""  Don't forget the magical moment when Patti's former group, Labelle, takes to the stage for the first time in over 15 years.  And you will not believe what this grand diva does with Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  If you can watch this tape and not hail Ms. Patti as one of the greatest stage performers ever, honey, you must be dead!",1001116800,13,695,4.484126984126984
1397010,5,B000056B0H,"Patti has never been able to capture in a live performance what she did here.  Her vocal range is constant, almost seems to grow in this concert.  Her backup singers rock like no one can imagine.  With Debbie Henry's show-stopping, ""Feed Me, Lord"", there is no touching the backup singers.  Moreover, there's no stopping Diva Labelle.  Singing classics like Ain't No Way, Send in the Clowns, and garnishing a standing ovation on Whitney Houston's ""All the Man I Need"", you will be breathless after seeing this concert.  I promise you it is one of her best performances ever!  Ever!  EVER!  She's live!  She's awesome!  She's... Patti LaBelle!",976665600,15,642,4.906542056074766
1397011,5,B000056B0H,First Of All It was Great Alone Getting Nona Hendryx&Sarah Dash On Stage With Patti. Patti Labelle Turned This Show Out. Her Voice Smokes Non-Stop. She is Timeless. If You Can Rock The Apollo You Know You Are  Superbad!&Patti Labelle is Still Unstoppable as this Performance  Showcases.,959558400,3,286,5.0638297872340425
1397012,5,B000056B0H,"The single most stunning live performance I have ever seen in the 35 years I've been living is the reunion of Patti LaBelle,  Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash included on this tape.  If you appreciate GREAT singers,  the vocal  workout between the girls on Nona's ""Release Yourself"" will leave  you with your mouth hanging open. In the history of popular music there has  never been anything like Labelle--and never will be again.  Check it out!",943660800,6,440,4.786666666666667
1397013,5,B000056B0H,"Taped during the promotional tour of her ""Burnin'"" CD in 1992, Miss Patti demonstrates once again why she has stood the test of time.  It's no secret that she gives her all and then some during her live  performances and this video captures the diva at work.  Filmed at the  Apollo in New York, Patti performs several songs from the  ""Burnin'"" cd and even has special guests Big Daddy Kane, Sarah  Dash and Nona Hendryx.  She also pays homage to her classic repertoire  ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" ""Lady Marmalade"" and  ""You Are My Friend,""  among others.  As an added delight, she  performs a medley of songs which she admits that she passed up the  opportunity to record and became hits for others such as ""Rush  Rush"" and ""All The Man I Need.""  A must have video joint for  any Patti LaBelle aficionado.",932428800,6,807,4.577464788732394
1397014,5,B000056B0H,"This video is a must for every Patti fan, or if you have never seen her live then it is a must.  It is Pattti LaBelle at her best.  Taped in the Apollo Theater this video brings out the best of the pop devia with some of  here best hits to inculde ""You are my friend"" and "" Over the  Rainbow"".  This is truly a magical evening with the one and only  Patti LaBelle.",911692800,6,364,3.8513513513513513
7931932,5,B000056B0H,"I've already watched this concert on YouTube, but I wanted to see if the DVD quality was any better.  I'm glad I got the DVD.  It's nice to put Patti on while I'm doing things around the house.  The quality is just as you would expect for something recorded in 1991, decent.  The only thing that I will say is I hope the person who edited this has gotten better over the years.  Sometimes they cut away from Patti too fast while she is in the middle of just grooving on stage, its fun to see.",1480982400,2,492,4.083333333333333

7931936,5,B000056B0H,"Loved it. the ultimate diva, she sings those songs like no one else can. patti  is queen of the whole deal. I came on here to buy another copy, but the price has been raised too high, so i'll wait. also, I had very good sound, and good video quality. also, the incredible Debbie henry gives some hair raising performances on this as well as the great Labelle[the group] and big daddy kane. it was just an awesome concert the likes of which are rarely seen.",1414713600,,456,4.3023255813953485
7931937,5,B000056B0H,"If you are a true Patti LaBelle fan, this is a must have DVD. I still have this concert on VHS but I've always wanted it on DVD. Some people have written that the quality is not good; well it's not as clear as Patti's ""Live! One Night Only"" But this is still a great DVD and outstanding concert. I own both and since this one is now out of print, I feel sorry for those of you who will never own a copy. Great investment; this DVD is now selling for hundreds. I believe I purchased the last ""new"" one for less than $100 and I am very pleased.",1398211200,,542,3.9363636363636365
7931938,5,B000056B0H,"Wonderful performance.  Truly a Lengendary Performer. If anyone wants to have longevity they should take care of their voice and learn from singers like Patti, Cher, Tina, Diana, Gladys, Bette Midler and most of all Barbar Striesand.",1380672000,2,233,5.297297297297297
7931939,5,B000056B0H,"I think this is one of Patti's best concerts. It says little to say she gives her all but it must be said she gives us a lot of songs. This is the longer of most of the concert I've seen for her, if not all. The little gem moments aren't all Patti. There was a great reunited song performance with her, Nona Hendrix and Ms. Sara Dash of, I think, their last single together ""Release yourself"". A duet with Daddy Kane who threw in a couple of impromptu  rap licks. Her background singers gave a more than fair performance of an old James Taylor song, ""Shower the people"" with an intro solo to ""You are my friend"" from background singer Debbie Henry, who has some strong pipes of her own. It may be a few too many slow tunes too close together for some but all in all I think it was one of Patti's best concerts. I guess that's why it's already a classic.",1359331200,3,853,4.13855421686747
7931940,4,B000056B0H,"I had purchased the VHS of this Pattie LaBelle concert years ago and lost the tape. This is the most some what up to date version of Patti for those who love this Diva extrodinare!!!! She continues to belt the clasics and has not slowed down even past the age of 60!!! Patti sings and she sings, and there is no one like her today. I fully recomend this dvd for all Pattie Fans, and the only flaw is that it doesn't have all of her hits on it.",1264982400,2,443,3.9887640449438204
7931941,5,B000056B0H,"Patti LaBelle is super good, but i think this was her first video, and she made a horrible show. She never takes u into a song, and plays all the way thru, and finishes good. It's spotty, she has mostly dud times in the video/ but she'll tell u herself/ she sure does like that this is 'make a video.' I did not like it/ i dumped it. Patti LaBelle should be known as a super great singer.",1216598400,,388,3.9871794871794872
