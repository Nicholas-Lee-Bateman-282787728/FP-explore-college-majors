8170921,4,B000MQCB0E,"""A British drummer accidentally deserts his regiment,"" so the story unfolds. The war is the American War of Independence, and the drummer is a great physical comedian. This is a fun example of what can still be done today with the silent form of comedy. A great achievement at blending silent comedy with the color film form.

Evidence of a Keaton and Laurel influence can be seen. I liked the way that the comedy storyline is interwoven with a dramatic war story. The choice of music is excellent and the period costumes and warfare are well translated to the small screen. There is no way to place this film correctly, it's a comedy but also a drama. It shows battle scenes that could be right out of D. W. Griffith or comedy scenes that could be right out of Keaton. Well done.",1311724800,,780,4.492957746478873
8170922,4,B000MQCB0E,"I enjoyed this film - the historic re-creations, the musical score and of course the comedy! Eric has made a very entertaining film, fun for all ages. If you like Revolutionary battles, slapstick comedy and action, this film is worth seeing.",1266278400,,241,4.902439024390244
8170923,5,B000MQCB0E,The Deserter is a very funny and interesting film that puts together comedy and the Rev War. Since I enjoy both I really like it. The DVD is very professionally done.,1265587200,,166,4.387096774193548
8170924,5,B000MQCB0E,"Borgman's physical portrayal of The Deserter is a smooth blend of Stan Laurel and Buster Keaton with great pratfalls and timing.  I would recommend this as required viewing for highschoolers studying the Revolutionary War for its pagentry, uniforms, and battle scenes.",1232150400,,268,5.536585365853658
8170925,1,B000MQCB0E,"As stated... a re-do that ruined the original greatness of the silent film ""il deserto"". Appeared ""homemade"". Sold it on Ebay in a day after watching it. Poorly made, no originality and obviously of the low / no budget documentary gendre. Suprisingly enough it is likely found on the Razzies WebSite actually amazed it was even mentioned there. If you enjoy these types of ""silents"" or ""indie films"" it may be something for you, however I REALLY DID NOT ENJOY IT and have never tried to sell a film I had originally hope to keep as part of my collection so quickly. An utter disappointment.",1231027200,,590,4.628571428571429
