8408205,5,B003XKQ63Y,As a long time nature lover particularly of animals this series was always captivating when it first aired. Now we own the series of specials and the shows themselves and watch them often. There is nothing more captivating than watching baby critters born and growing up wild. You will love them too!,1382227200,,300,4.788461538461538

We got this with the other one (the rest of the seasons) plus the original episodes - all seasons.",1338336000,,210,4.146341463414634
8408207,5,B003XKQ63Y,"My wife bought me this video and I've watched it over many times. As an outdoors enthusiast I'm always looking to learn more about our American wildlife; the best place to find them in their natural habitat, things to avoid and what these creatures are like. Wild America brings all this and more.",1312502400,,297,4.622641509433962
8408208,5,B003XKQ63Y,"After watching BBC's Planet Earth, it got me interested in learning more about the wildlife of North America in particular.  This DVD set is terrific and was exactly what I was looking for.  There were two things that I liked especially when it came to the set.  The first was the narrating by Robert Redford, which I think was better when compared to David Attenborough and Planet Earth.  The second aspect was the great depth that Stouffer went to in showing so much wildlife in such short time.  Overall I would highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who is looking for something similar to Planet Earth.",1310428800,,608,4.644859813084112

8408210,5,B003XKQ63Y,"Like a lot of people, I'm a pet lover. However this dvd set has turned me into an eager wildlife student. I originally bought it for my nephew, who would live at a zoo if he could, but I was surprised to see that there are many more animals in American wildlife than I could've ever expected. This series has just the right amounts of spontaneity and humor from the host and the animals. My nephew and I loved it!",1307491200,3,413,4.175
8408211,5,B003XKQ63Y,"I loved watching Wild America with my dad on when it aired on PBS, so I gave him both DVD sets last Father's Day. As we watched the specials again, we both found them as captivating as when we first saw them. Stouffer's commitment to filming wildlife is beyond comparison.",1307491200,3,272,4.46
