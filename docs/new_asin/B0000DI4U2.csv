8001020,5,B0000DI4U2,great dvd. I wished they would have continued doing other volumes.,1460678400,,66,5.090909090909091
8001021,5,B0000DI4U2,"excellent animations sung in spanish, great woman voice, not originals but very good versions. My daugther loves it! suited for all ages, specially little ones 2 to 6 years",1408924800,,172,4.9655172413793105
8001022,1,B0000DI4U2,"This DVD includes the exact same content as Cri Cri Las Numero 1. It includes the same songs and animations. I mistakenly purchased this DVD, ""Teatro de la Floresta de Cri-Cri Perros, Gatos y Ratones"" and the DVD, ""Cri Cri Las Numero 1,"" and was dismayed to find out that these are in fact THE SAME DVD with different titles and different covers. Amazon has done a poor job of providing a detailed product description. At the very minimum the description should include a detailed listing of the songs included in the animation. If this was explicit in the product description I would not have purchased both DVDs believing they included different songs and content. I was disappointed to learn I purchased two of the same product, one more expensive than the other.  Now I have to deal with the hassle of returning or exchanging the DVD... and according to the return policy having the cost of shipping deducted from my refund. I hope other consumers will not make the same mistake due to a poor product description. Amazon also suggests these two titles be purchased together leading you to believe they are different items when in fact they are the SAME DVD. You should also know as noted in other product reviews, the songs are not sung by the original author. I was aware of this after reading the reviews but decided to give the DVDs a chance, unfortunately I got two DVDs with the exact same songs and animation, NOT WHAT I WANTED.",1371686400,2,1438,4.63921568627451
8001023,5,B0000DI4U2,"I grew up listening to Cri-Cri's songs. Unlike trendy music, Cri-Cri's songs are timeless. My son was already familiar with his music but we wanted something visual. This DVD is wonderful. The musical arragements are exquisite. The animations are fantastic, soft and gentle for a newborn and engaging for an older baby.
The only but -a very minor one in my opinion- is that Francisco Gabilondo Soler -Cri-Cri himself- is NOT singing. However, the lady that does is simply stunning.
Needless to say, my 11-month-old baby boy would watch this DVD 15 times in a row if I'd let him. He even turns on the DVD player when he wants to watch it, which is everyday ;)",1259366400,2,658,4.632478632478633
8001024,5,B0000DI4U2,I WAS BROUGHT UP LISTENING TO THESE SONGS MY GRANDPA WOULD SING THEM TO ME. WHEN MY BABIES WERE BORN I WANTED THEM TO LISTEN TO THESE SONGS ITS A GREAT WAY TO SUROUND THEM WITH THE SPANISH LANGUAGE THEY LOVE TO SEE THIS DVD THEY SING AND PLAY TO IT. THEY SHOULD MAKE MORE LIKE THIS ONE,1162684800,,285,3.9310344827586206
8001025,5,B0000DI4U2,"How do you keep a four-year-old interested in learning Spanish when there is no one in the family that speaks it? After a few children's spanish learning DVDs, I ran out of ideas. Thanks to previous reviews, I gave this one a try and was pleasantly surprised. My son practically hugged the screen the whole time and kept asking me what they were singing and hushed me when he wanted to hear the words better. The words are very easy and clearly vocalized. Now I only need to find the dictionary and make sure I know what they are singing too.",1145318400,4,542,4.376237623762377
8001026,5,B0000DI4U2,"As one reviewer wrote below, true, Francisco Gabilondo-Soler AKA ""Cri Cri"" (El Grillito Cantor) is not the singer in this DVD, although it is his voice that you hear do an introduction at the beginning.  But the lady that sings his songs has an excellent voice and did a wonderful job with them.  Her enunciation is also very good (clear and easy to comprehend), in case one of you is interested in this DVD as a Spanish language learning tool.  As the songs play, their lyrics are shown onscreen as well.

My two-and-a-half year old daughter absolutely loved this CD, she asked to have it played a 2nd time, and then a 3rd time!  The animation has a very unique 3-D effect to it, not the kind of 3-D that you need the special kind of viewing glasses for, but something like what you'd see through a Viewmaster (if you remember those).  Now, it's not very high-techy otherwise, do not expect this do be a Disney or Dreamworks ""lifelike"" type of animation, but it isn't junk either like sometimes you get with the lesser known videos.

The only thing I wish it had, was a list of the songs.  That would come in handy when you want to play a specific one.  Neither the CD case nor the literature inside have one.

But all in all, I recommend it without reservation.  Can't wait for Volume Two.",1144108800,10,1291,4.427966101694915
8001027,4,B0000DI4U2,I'm a kindergarden teacher in Chicago. I grew up in Mexico listening to CriCri's music and I love it! But this DVD with a female voice is easier for kids to sing along with. I highly recommend this product for kids who want to learn spanish. Also to keep the spanish language alive in families with a latin backround.,1089244800,11,317,4.389830508474576
8001028,2,B0000DI4U2,"I'm very disappointed with this DVD, certainly the songs belong to Francisco Gabilondo Soler ""Cri Cri"" (El Grillito Cantor); but singing by someone else. I grew up in Mexico with the Cri Cri's songs, they are really fantastic, actually I have all the Cri Cri's songs (singing by Cri Cri) in CDs that I still enjoy with my children.
I thought this DVD had like a ""live"" songs, sang by ""Cri Cri"".
If you really want to listen to ""Cri Cri"" go for a Cri Cri's CD.",1075939200,7,459,4.287356321839081
