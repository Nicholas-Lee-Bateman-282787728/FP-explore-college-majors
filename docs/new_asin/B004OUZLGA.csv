If some parts were supposed to be funny they were not.  I didn't even make it through the whole movie, it doesn't put you to sleep it just lacks substance, you keep waiting for somehting to happen to give the movie some purpose but it never does.

4441868,3,B004OUZLGA,"Film makers are always trying to take a favorite genre or film and retune it to today's standards. The problem is that in attempting to take that treasured classic they usually turn it into something it wasn't to begin with thus losing what they wanted to do in the first place. This is the case with THE BIG BANG, a movie that wants so much to be a film noire detective story but ends up falling short.

Antonio Banderas stars as Ned Cruz, a private eye hired by Anton ""The Pro"" Protopov (Robert Malliet), a 7 foot tall giant ex-boxer just released from prison for murder. It seems that while in jail, Anton had been receiving letters from a beautiful woman named Lexie, swearing her undying love for him. Once released, he discovered that her address is a vacant lot so he hires Ned to track her down.

The first place they look for her is a strip club where she worked. Anton's explosive temper gets the better of him and a few beat up bouncers later the pair make a hasty exit. Ned advises him that it would be better if he worked alone at this time and he moves on with his search.

The second person he talks to is an adult film director played by Snoop Dogg. Once more this leads to a dead end as does a talk with a down on her luck actress who hires out to a medical college to portray various mental illnesses. All roads lead nowhere until Ned talks to a mail carrier and finds that the letters sent back to the vacant lot are being forwarded to a small town in New Mexico.

Driving to the town Ned finds out that it's owned by Simon Kestral (Sam Elliott), a reclusive zillionaire with dreams of physics, ions, and a search for the God particle that have made him build his own particle generator in hopes of creating one. Sure it might result in a black hole where the earth was but he's searching any way. It is in Kestral's home that the search finally ends in more ways than one but that would blow the surprise so watch and see to discover what it is.

That is if you don't mind waiting almost 90 minutes for a movie to get interesting. There are touches here and there that make you continue watching and the art direction and photography are amazing. The film is shot with bright fluorescent coloring and makes it seem to glow in a surreal stylization not seen before. While it does make it amazing to look at, it doesn't make the twists and turns of the story any more palatable.

The movie tries too hard to be complicated. It delves into topics that are used as metaphors but that don't do so in such a way that if you weren't already interested in those topics you wouldn't catch the comparison. It's like the old Steve Martin joke from his stand up days where he discusses the size of wrenches and sockets because he thought he was performing for a group of plumbers. If you aren't a part of the group you don't get the joke.

The acting is by far the best thing in this film. Given the story to perform, all hands do a great job. Banderas does his best as a tough P.I. and carries it off easily. As the three cops that interrogate him from the beginning of the film to nearly the end, Delroy Lindo, William Fichtner and Thomas Kretschmann are all perfectly suited to the various characters they are offered.

I wanted to like this film and I honestly enjoyed it on a visual level. But having been a fan of film noire and classic hard boiled detective flicks for years I found it a bit of a let down. Still, some may enjoy this one so I wouldn't totally write it off. If this is the style of film you like then by all means give it a try. If nothing else you'll see what I mean about the film's visuals.",1306713600,,3624,4.249637155297533

I rented so I'm not sure about the retail disc but there were no subtitles on the rental. If there's no subtitles on the retail version some of the characters will be hard to hear/understand because it's overloaded with distinct voices and accents.

Cruz (Banderas) begins the search for her and $30 million in diamonds she has. After his investigation begins to take stranger and stranger turns he wonders is this Lexie exists at all, or is he looking for something far more serious? This is a very strange, but good movie. I think it's best described as ""Southland Tales"" meets Quentin Tarantino. It's got the bizarreness of a Tarantino movie, mixed with the sci/fi aspects of ""Southland Tales"" or a ""Donnie Darko"" type movie. It's much easier to follow then those two, but the feel is the same. I would recommend it to those that like a different type of movie. This is defiantly not for everyone, but it's worth watching. Not many Sci/Fi - crime mysteries being made these days. It does drag in some parts. I liked it, but the slow parts hurt the movie. I give it a B-

4441872,2,B004OUZLGA,"""The Big Bang""  is a film noir-inspired  detective thriller.  Late one night, private investigator Ned Cruz (Antonio Banderas) gets a visit from a recently paroled Russian boxer with a job offer:  find Lexie, his missing girlfriend, and the $30 million stash of diamonds she's hiding.  As Detective Cruz sets out to find her, the clues send him to some colorful characters, from a Hollywood action star (James Van Der Beek) with a dirty secret, to an enterprising porn producer (Snoop Dog) who takes a personal interest in his work, to a kinky waitress (Autumn Reeser) with a fetish for particle physics.  Lexie proves elusive and Cruz becomes obsessed with finding her.

This is a strange film.  It combines the mystery genre with the basics of physics, interrupting the narrative several times with monologues that stop the action dead.  The script falls into the trap of providing extraneous details to shore up the science aspect of the plot, making for a picture top-heavy with talk.  Banderas looks as lost as many viewers will be trying to figure out this weird spin on what should have been a straightforward murder mystery.

Blu-ray extras include director audio commentary, a making-of featurette, and extended scenes.  The film is also available on DVD.",1305763200,2,1264,5.024038461538462
4441873,3,B004OUZLGA,"Visually fascinating, THE BIG BANG is an uncredited, updated rip-off of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe mystery, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY.  The plot outline and characters are virtually identical to Chandler's classic film noir, and director Tony Krantz even ""borrows"" some memorable touches from Edward Dmytryk's 1944 filming of the story, MURDER, MY SWEET.

Among the many problems with THE BIG BANG is that Krantz and screenwriter Erik Jendresen have decided to update the Chandler story at all.  The novelist's stories are set in 1930s-1940s Los Angeles, and that's where they belong.

The filmmakers have added a few new twists to the mystery and, worst of all, they've now tied the solution into ""The Big Bang Theory,"" which results in the audience being subjected to a raft of talk about physics in a movie that is already burdened with stilted dialogue.

Antonio Banderas plays the honest private eye who is hired by a big palooka to find the stripper girl friend that disappeared while he was serving a jail sentence.  Also in the cast are Sam Elliott, Delroy Lindo and several other good actors who, in all probability, did their roles for the paycheck.

Although I admire Dmytryk's filming of the Chandler novel, which starred Dick Powell, I think that the best movie version of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY was made in 1975 with Robert Mitchum.  In any event, both of those are better than this one.

4441896,2,B004OUZLGA,"""The Big Bang"" is a crime thriller about a LA private investigator Ned Cruz (Antonio Banderas). The detective accepts the job offered by Anton (Robert Maillet), a recently paroled ex-boxer, who wants Ned to find his ""missing love"" Lexie (Sienna Guillory). While searching for his client's dream girl (who may not really exist), Ned finds himself attracted to her.

The noir-ish story that reminds us of Raymond Chandler is told with a meticulous eye for the details of the underworld populated by eccentric characters, and some references to physics. Not many crime thrillers involve a particle collider and a sexy waitress with a fetish for particle physics. I like noir films in general, and surreal ""Kiss Me Deadly"" is one of my favorite films, but frankly I don't see the point of introducing physics-related elements into a noir story.

As a noir per se, the film is only passable. Ned's investigation part is told in the flashback section with voiceovers - not exactly the most effective narrative method here. Banderas is very good, and so are other players including William Fichtner, Thomas Kretschmann and Delroy Lindo as three officers interrogating beaten up and blinded Ned, as well as Sam Elliott as a reclusive billionaire obsessed with one scientific experiment.

Maybe I should not take the film too seriously and just enjoy the ride. The quirky thriller offers something unusual here and there, though the storyline is kept pretty simple overall. If you are looking for something different, you may find this one interesting.",1338163200,,1543,5.090909090909091
4441897,5,B004OUZLGA,"This is supposed to be a detective movie. It went well beyond.
In actuality, it's a cross between Pulp Fiction, Dr. Strangelove, and Hitchcock on LSD.

If there is a moral to the story, it is that Reality isn't optional; our own weirdness cannot outrun Reality; Reality always catches up with us; and, if you screw with the limits of Reality, things aren't going to end well.

This movie is weird without being edgy, and strange without going into the twilight Zone. It's visually pleasing. The action is well paced. The storyline is predictable, but off key enough to keep you guessing. And even if you guess right, it doesn't turn out the way you expected. Not even remotely.

In short, it's highly entertaining. It's a masterpiece in a new genre. And the ending was better than anything I could have imagined, plus I haven't laughed that hard in a long while.

This could only work so well because the director knew what he was doing, the camera crew was top line, the film editor nailed it perfectly, and the actors are all first class. Kudos to everyone on this project.",1335571200,,1075,4.612565445026178
4441898,5,B004OUZLGA,"Direct to Video or B movies used to mean a bad story, b or c list stars, and mediocre action/horror/effects. The 1970's, 1980's, and the early 1990's were the hay day for these kinds of films. Films such as Piranha and Piranha II, Space Rage, Moon 44, Rising Storm, and the endless serial killer/horror movies to name a few. Things began to change in the mid 1990's and the invention of the DVD, but I really believe it was the endless the many B movie companies, and the Big ones seeing the chance to make money decided to get involved also, which put more money and better stars into the movies. Stars like Eric Roberts, Keith David, Val Kilmer, Michael Maidson, Roy Schieder, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, and above average to good films like End Game, Unthinkable, The Peacekeeper, Chaos, Executive Target, Edison, and Streets of Blood to name a few. Direct to DVD isn't a bad thing anymore and a quiet a few of them are as good if not better than films being release in theaters now, which leads me to The Big Bang.

The Big Bang is a suspense/drama/comedy starring Antonio Banderas, William Fichtner, Sienna Guillory, Thomas Kretschmann, and Delroy Lindo. The plot follows Ned Cruz (Antonio Banderas) waking up in a police interrogation room with three police officers Detective Poley (William Fichtner), Detective Skeres (Deloroy Lindo), and Dectective Frizer (Thomas Kretschmann). The three detectives begin to question Ned, and Ned begins his story which he tells in the first person and narrates it. The story starts up when private detective Ned Cruz is finishing up a case for a high profile and eccentric actor Johnny Nova played well by James Van Der Beek. What ensues is funny as Johnny Nova's house blows up after Ned leaves with his payment nearly killing him. Ned is questioned by Det Frizer but let go. Ned returns to his office and about to head out when Anton Protopov (Robert Maillet) asks Ned to find a woman names Lexie Persimmon (Sienna Guillory) who had been writing him in prison. The thrilling suspense/drama ensues mixed beautifully with comedy.

The acting was superb, although Kretschmann, Lindo, and Fichtner don't have to do much in the film. That being said their still brought out their A games, and made their characters interesting. Banderas was excellent in this film mixing a straight face with comedy wonderfully. In my opinion the minor actors steal the show. Sam Elliott (Simon Kestral) playing a recluse billionaire, Robert Maillet who is a huge and scary man plays a very likable character. Jimmi Simpson (Niels Geck) who plays the lead scientist for Simon's experiment. Then there is Sienna Guillory the beautiful actress who by the end the movie has stole the show with her beauty and acting. There is even Snoop Dog who plays a porn director who did a good job and as always enjoyed his scenes.

The action was few and far between, but it works for this film. I find that most Hollywood films coming out now try to stuff action down our throats. I can understand why most Americans now don't have long attention spans so studios have to have explosion, car chase, or someone being killed every five minutes. I think that hurts films it takes away from the story, the actors, and characters, which makes a good film into an average one, or a bad film into an average one. The Big Bang doesn't try to stuff violence and action down your throats. It doesn't have to, it has a great story, with good acting, and decent action.

Overall this is a great film, and better than many movies that have come out into the theaters recently. I gave this film 5/5 stars and recommend everyone see this. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1331164800,3,3675,4.728549141965678

The shapes and lines were reminiscent of F.L. Wright and further enhanced the movies surreal visual appeal. The scenes were also mood dominated by a mesmerizing manipulation of smoke/fog, color, lighting and camera angles and further mood altered by a superb range of sound effects from eerie silence to haunting music.

The physics, humorously propped by Planck's Constant Cafe and a body tattoo showing a high energy particle collision, interjected itself with long philosophical discussions about the meaning of the Universe, of life and of intelligence and also acted as a metaphysical counterpoint to the so-called mysteries of life.

Banderas does the typical gumshoe first person narration which turns out really sad due to his accent. In a comic boxing scene Anton crushes his opponent in the boxing ring, then suddenly remembers to take a dive. His quest involves a twisted plot which includes the porn industry which is shooting a movie called ""The Black Hole"" in a building called ""Schrodingers"", and a string of murders which follows Banderas as he searches for Lexie (Sienna Guillory).

Eventually Bandaras travels to New Mexico from California (was that the sunset he was driving into?) and goes to a restaurant called ""Planck's Constant"" (What? No Beta Bar?) Clearly if you haven't had a little atomic physics in your life, you are not going to get the little subtleties. The search for the missing person becomes metaphoric as searching for a theoretical particle. However if you can't figure it out, the movie explains it you.

The comical lines spoken by Banderas were good, but it was like having someone who can't tell a joke tell you a real funny joke. Someone like a younger Bruce Willis needed to play that role. If you are going to create a movie which is a metaphor, don't explain it in the movie. The audience is supposed to figure it out for themselves. Sam Elliot was good. This could have easily been a cult classic in the style of Tarantino, but having Banderas as the lead and explaining the metaphor in the film ruined it. Ending was good.

4441910,5,B004OUZLGA,"Director Tony Krantz and Screenwriter Eric Jenderson have definitely done their Film Noir homework in this excellent modern day merge of the Philip Marlowe/Mike Hammer private eye genre 'THE BIG BANG'.  The story begins as a carbon copy remake of Edward Dmytryk's 'MURDER MY SWEET'-1944 where Dick Powell played the shamus character which was remade with Robert Mitchum in Director Dick Richard's underrated 'FAREWELL MY LOVELY'-1975 where we now have a new Marlowe named Ned Cruz played brilliantly by Antonio Banderas being sought out by a big palooka fighter/ex con looking for his beloved girlfriend here named Lexie. Slowly, a routine missing persons case becomes a pandoras box of intrigue which enters into Director Robert Aldrich's territory of the theme of the great whatzit in his masterpiece 'KISS ME DEADLY'-1955 where here Sam Elliot plays a Howard Hughes like recluse experimenting with quantum physics to recreate the seconds before the scientific big bang theory of the end of the world.  It sounds complicated and far fetched but the film works combining beautiful color images and photography by Shelly Johnson and an electrifying guitar score by Johnny Marr turning the enterprise into a rollicking good time.  The acting is awesome by all the players making the impossible seem believable , I will not divulge the crux of the plot, that's up to you to decipher and enjoy. Suffice it to say that in this modern day film world of bloated mindless dreck, we sometimes experience a silk purse of which Director Krantz should be truly proud of.  Combining genres and sometimes European film making in the mix, 'THE BIG BANG' is a refreshing piece of celluloid which will appeal to fans of the Detective and Fantasy film genres.  Anchor Bay releases it in a nice 2.35 transfer with great Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, a great featurette on the genesis of the film, extended scenes and Audio Commentary with Director Krantz and Co-Producer Reece Peterson.

The solution to the mystery will cost ten lives, net $30 million and just might explain - well - everything.'  It would be difficult to summarize the unsummarizable better. Toss in a few good cameos by Snoop Dogg, James Van Der Beek, Autumn Reeser, Rebecca Mader and Robert Maillet and you have a colorful cast without a whole lot to say.

Despite its weak storyline the film takes on a life of its own with flashback sequences taking us out of the initial interrogation room while Banderas tells the story - and tantalizes the cops with knowledge of diamonds.  The  film often seems like a parody of serious crime films and as such it is entertaining.  Grady Harp, June 11",1307232000,,1598,4.760869565217392

But once I made the decision to watch it, it was just a matter of grabbing some Popcorn and allowing the movie to do what it was made to do; entertain me.  And that's exactly what it did.

And better than that it was filled with something most movies made for profit don't have, few special effects, a simple storyline; that offers the viewer a challenge, and a plot that was totally complex and worth the investment of time and money.

Every aspect of the movie complimented the plot so well. The only thing was, I found myself wondering whey they didn't get off the road sooner. But everyone got exactly what they deserved, and the innocent lived happily ever after.

Do yourself a favor ignore the reviews that only compliment the writers ability to put so many words together and watch this move, you will be entertained.

8437330,5,B004OUZLGA,"Film noir meets science fiction with a dash of surrealism thrown in for good measure adds up to a movie that probably shouldn't work very well.
""The Big Bang,"" however, does. It's got drama, some truly interesting characters, a fortune in missing diamonds, ruminations on particle physics, a nice plot twist, humor, and some very good performances by a cast full of veteran actors ranging from Antonio Banderas to Sam Elliot.
The movie is an homage to Raymond Chandler and other mystery writers of the Thirties and Forties. If you are a fan of those novels, and the movies that were based on them, you'll recognize some of the characters and plot points. Banderas, for example, plays private detective Ned Cruz who has grown a little world weary, wondering what his life is all about when, on one night, a very large Russian boxer demands that he take a case. Cruz doesn't want to do it but is persuaded to do so because the Russian is willing to pay him a lot of money and because it involves finding a beautiful woman who has written to the boxer when he was in prison.
If you think this sounds a lot like ""Murder, My Sweet"" starring Dick Powell back in the day, you're right.
Cruz eventually finds the woman, a former stripper and porn star who is now the wife of an eccentric billionaire searching for what physicists call ""The God Particle."" Things get a little weird - in a good way - after that.
Much of the action takes place in a small room where Cruz is being interrogated by three cops. Straight out of crime dramas from the late Forties and early Fifties, this is a brutal interrogation and Cruz gets smacked around a bit during it but generally manages to keep his cool. In a series of flashbacks he tells the cops how he ended up both temporarily blind and in their custody. He convinces them to let him guide them to a place where millions of dollars worth of diamonds are hidden and the story switches to the present tense from then on.
This is not an overly violent movie, though a lot of violence is implied. It is also a pretty sexy one, including one scene in which Cruz and a waitress with some bizarre tattoos that are based on particle physics make love in a motel. Although erotic, it's also laced with humor.
It's not a mainstream movie but, for my money, this is an inventive and very enjoyable film.",1492473600,,2326,4.475294117647059
