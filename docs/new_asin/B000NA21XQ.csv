2762235,5,B000NA21XQ,This documentary does a good job of capturing boot camp and OCS environments. I distinctly remember both the bewilderment of the first couple of days of OCS and the pride then earning Platoon Honor Man upon graduation. My OCS class will celebrate our 50th anniversary of becoming 2nd Lts in 2016. The memory of OCS and Basic School is still fresh. It was an honor to spend active duty time as  a Marine and then live the rest of my life as a Marine with a different type of uniform. The values and commitment stay with you forever.,1448409600,,531,4.418367346938775

2762237,5,B000NA21XQ,"An  extraordinary documentary that careful shows the merging of a diverse group of young men (mostly) into one unit, one body. the fastidiousness and clarity of the training is amazing to witness.  Additionally, the revelation of the officer selection and training process is equally brilliant.

I had the pleasure of spending three days at Parris Island this past July as an adult supervisor with a group of 40 high school ROTC students attending a 5-day leadership course.  It was brilliant and tough, and the young people will never forget it.  They were treated just like recruits.

I strongly recommend this video.",1442016000,2,619,5.079207920792079

2762260,4,B000NA21XQ,"Garret C. Brown's critique is biased and unwarranted. I can say that having been in both branches both active duty that the Marine Corps by far is a superior  force with traditions expiration de  corps and discipline being 2nd to none... Army airborne drops are nothing and rangers are over rated in their capabilities.
Take a look within the last 20 years and you'll see why Marines keep getting a budget, keep getting called back to do tough jobs, because we do it effectively. Plus America doesn't need a Marine Corps it wants one, and for that reason is why we continually have to keep proving ourselves.
If rangers are so capable why didn't they handle Fall Utah themselves along with the so ""highly"" praised ""airborne""? Because they aren't as good as the army would like to think. We can also look back at Somalia, we stabilized the region handed over to the ""rangers"" and they ended up losing it.
It's hard to imagine why the Marine Corps has a certain mentality, why it acts a certain way, and because of that some may say that it's too good to be true... I used to say that before I became a Marine; I was on the outside looking in. So until you've successfully served in both branches I don't believe you can really say anything. No disrespect to any of the other services, but Marines both current and veterans go out of the way for each other and I haven't seen that in any of the sister branches.",1414108800,,1409,4.457364341085271

2762281,3,B000NA21XQ,"It was better than expected. Not over-hyped. Not a recruiting video. The Marines and civilians that were interviewed behaved and talked like real people. They interviewed a good cross section of Marines (active and retired, old and young). I've see other military DVDs where there was a lot of hype, blaring/dramatic music, lots of computer aided graphics, etc. Thankfully, this was not the case with this DVD.

The DVD seemed to show the realities of becoming a Marine. It showed the enlisted man's perspective as well as the Officer Candidate School (OCS).  Most of it showed some of the rigors that the men underwent during basic training and OCS. Part of the program was was devoted to historical segments from past wars.

The worst part was the segment on female Marines. The females talked it up like they did everything the males did, but it was a lie. They never showed females undergoing the same training as males. To start with, the females were NOT forced to have their heads shaved; nope, Rapunzel gets to keep her nice head of hair. And then they talked about leveling the playing field for females by using technology. The interviewers were polite about it, but essentially they were saying that females are second rate Marines. If females want to be known as first rate Marines, then they must perform the EXACT same rigors as the male Marines, including front-line combat. Anything other than total equality is substandard. And that includes getting their heads shaved.

Airborne operations are what starts a war and the army are the last to leave a battlefield. Marines are good soldiers, but are they the best of the best? I'm sure there are recon marines that are better than berets and vice versa, they all have different jobs and different skill sets. But overall the army is the backbone of the military and is what gets the job done. I respect marines and what they do with the... What's a word for it?

2762321,5,B000NA21XQ,"The U.S. Marine Corps has withstood many battles and prevailed, from the withering fire of foreign battlefronts around the globe, to the backstabbing attempts by Army generals afraid of losing control of their congressional funds and a Congress whose political wavering blew with the prevailing political winds. However, through it all, the Marine Corps has not only survived, it has prevailed. It prevailed because each time the country called, Marines were standing tall to take up any challenge and confront any foe. Following the battle for Iwo Jima, Secretary of the Navy, James Forestall, said the ""flag raising on Iwo Jima means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.""

The Corps also prevailed because it was and is adaptable. It not only led the way in amphibious landing, it initiated close air support of ground troops to the point that, before WW II, German Luftwaffe officers studied Marine close air-ground combat tactics. As times and challenges have changed with more recent threats to the United States, a fast moving, self sufficient force with its own supply lines, its own air, tanks, artillery, and communications, has made the Marine infantryman a force to be reckoned with.

In 1775, at Tun Tavern, Philadelphia, the first battalion of Marines was raised by an act of Congress. Since then, Marines have done the country's bidding without question or subterfuge, in line with its motto, Semper Fidelis - Always Faithful.

Although there are some older Marines who talk about the ""Old Corps"" as though it is gone forever, this DVD about the new Corps shows that, although situations, protocols and environments have changed, the Marines produced by the Corps today, both officer and enlisted, are the same hard-charging, gung ho Marines that first stormed the beaches in the Bahamas and took the British fort to gain weapons and gunpowder for Washington's Continental Army, as they were in the battle for Fallujah and all the combat in between. The fact that a number of young men and women enlist today and try to become Marines in a time of conflict speaks to their backbone and their love of country.

Marines are a breed apart. The title ""MARINE"" must be earned and it's not easy. The bond that separates Marines from the rest is the one that not only brings them together in combat, but one that remains for life.

Short of taking the oath and suiting up yourself, this is a good view of what the Marine Corps is today, the challenges it offers and the pride one takes away when earning the title and becoming a U.S. MARINE!",1183507200,10,2550,4.8663594470046085

8175895,3,B000NA21XQ,"As a Marine I have to say that this film is just ""OK,"" no better. The seemingly never ending reference to ethos, ""...the characteristic spirit of a culture, era, or community as manifested in its beliefs and aspirations..."" is mind numbing. Simply saying that the Corps has a unique culture would be sufficient. I value my time in the Corps during the Vietnam War. What I learned molded me as a man, and formed my character, integrity, dedication and spirit of individual achievement and determination. It seems that a fundamental change in emphasis away from individual achievement and the will to improvise in a tough situation to a more progressive spirit of succeeding only as a group. Admittedly, teamwork is an integral part of the required characteristics of a Marine, but the determination and power of the individual had, apparently until now, been emphasized.

Much of the film was repetitious and lacked a certain sincerity. The segments that included ""non Corps"" programs were poorly chosen and denigrating to the overall message (IMO). Chesty Puller would probably walk out in the middle of this movie. The writers and directors missed a chance at greatness and settled for mediocrity.",1474761600,2,1198,5.081218274111675
