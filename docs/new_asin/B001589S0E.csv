When it arrived the shrink wrap looked sketchy like it was re-shrink wrapped. I shouldve taken a photo of the shrink wrap but did not. I could hear that the dvd was sliding around inside the case. The dvd has scratches, the box itself has scratches  and a slit on the back. The label looks like it has been glued on. Im not even sure if this is a legit copy or a burned copy. I tried watching it on my Mac and a message appeared on the screen that it was skipping over damaged areas and it never began playing. Im including photos.

I tried to set it off but wasn't able to get it off completely.  I decided to go to the library and see if they had the movie, they did and I got to see it.  I am not sending this DVD back because it will cost me more than I paid for it.

I am sorry that it didn't work.  I am hoping next time will be a better outcome.

I watched it on Netflix and I don't know how I never heard of it considering it has wonderful actors. I completely loved the movie so I literally watched it over and over until it was taken off Netflix online. So to amazon I ran to buy it so I could watch it again. I'm totally obsessed with this movie. It very accurately portrays the human reactions following disappointment and betrayal. By far my favorite movie. I even bought the sound track and learned one of the songs on piano. Seriously do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

I think Naomi Watts is out of character here and she has a somewhat dull and unattractive appearance in this show due to makeup, and dress. Edward Norton is wooden in this movie and shows no range. Doctor drags unfaithful wife to primitive area in 1920's China to punish her. They then are forced to see each other differently and begin to fall in love with one another.

3140945,5,B001589S0E,"One of the great advantages of film is that it can start with a story that appeared in another art form, namely literature, and by giving it a careful and creative reading the script writer can alter it, in major or little ways, to enhance its meaning and effect. Such changes can alter the thematic content for the better. This is the case with this story. In the Somerset Maugham's novel, upon which it is based, the main character, played here to perfection by Naomi Watts, is condemned to relive her life of static growth. However, in the film, which emphasizes the blunt but often overlooked fact that life is education, the characters not only reach out beyond the poet Shelley's 'painted veil'  to moral rectitude but also take the giant step of increasing their humanity by the simple but terribly difficult act of forgiveness.
  Another way in which the film can move beyond the novel upon which it is based is by its blunt and colorful presentation of the time and place in which the story takes place. If it be true (and I believe it is) that 'one picture is worth a thousand words' then this film which is a picture, though careful selection of location and great cinematography,  that revels in the awesome beauty of a Chinese backwater location not only stimulates the viewer's imagination but increases his appreciation for things unknown and, by doing so, becomes another way to convince the viewer that life is a tantalizing bouquet waiting to be unveiled despite its transient beauty. The point is made economically in a scene near the end of the film when the main character purchases a flower, knowing full well that its beauty will not last.  So too, the growth in human values pictorially represented by the camera, drawing back to a Hitchcockian  divine height to see the main character cross the busy street called life.
  One significant way by which a film can make its point beyond the form of the novel, which relies completely on the lyrical flow of language alone, is through the addition of music. Here the tantalizing gems written by Eric Satie, a french composer living and writing at the time in which the novel and the film were set, zero in on the bittersweet and persistent ambiguity of life.
  There are some who berate the story but this being its third film adaption must be evidence there are some who see its great potential significance. I think in this third adaption it has achieved that significance. Bravo to all concerned!  Adding this film to your collection and viewing it from time to time will enhance your life.",1474675200,,2564,4.713646532438479

A great part of the movie is  devoted to the hard work of western nuns and volunteers, emphasizing how children in a positive environment changes the way these future natives will accept progress. Of course there is the issue of adultery and how it negatively impacts the lives of the stars of the movie. The best recommendation of this production is that my wife wants to see it over and over again.",1473379200,,617,4.609090909090909

3140964,5,B001589S0E,"This exceptional film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel of the same title deserves more credit than the box office paid it a decade ago.

Set amid the Nationalist Revolution in China (and filmed in that country) in the 1920s, the plot teeters atop the the wall of emotional and political meltdown. Ed Norton (as the bacteriologist Walter Fane) and Liev Schreiber (as the philandering British consul Charles Townsend) turn in solid performances, but in this reviewer's eyes it is Naomi Watts who shines as Kitty Garston. Ignored by the husband who prefers the thrill of infectious diseases to his hot wife, she turns to Townsend and his bed for comfort.

The film splits time between early-20th-century Shanghai and the remote location to which Dr. Fane compels his adulterous wife to follow him as punishment. The camera captures both venues sumptuously, but it is the peaked landscape of the countryside that the visuals reach their dazzling potential, all amid the human chaos of a ravaging cholera epidemic.

When the bored Kitty finds both her place and her passion in tending to the children of a Catholic orphanage, Norton's Dr. Fane realizes what he has lost. His cruelty towards Kitty melts and love is re-born, just in time for cholera to snatch him away from Kitty before they can reinitiate the life that might have been if  hearts were softer and memories shorter. Her chance encounter with Townsend on a London street years later is a jaw-dropping emotional finale.

The Painted Face is a strong story well told, well spoken, well shot, and well framed by a gorgeous score.

What, no Oscars? 2006 must have been some year at the movies.",1468368000,,1654,4.910394265232975

The house they live in is old and in terrible condition. She is surrounded by strange people, whose customs she cannot understand. But it is as it is, and slowly, she works at conquering boredom and finding fulfillment in a way one can't imagine.
Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are brilliant at characterization, and we see a time in China where the overlord treats his people no better than slaves. I highly recommend this marvelous version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel.",1462579200,,810,4.593103448275862
3140986,4,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil is a bit of romance, but mostly drama.  It's about Naomi Watts who sleeps with a man (Liev Schreiber) and disobeying her husband in the process (Edward Norton).  Naomi gets the surprise of her life when Edward reveals he was aware of it, so guess what he does?
Well nothing too bad I suppose since the film takes place in England and China in the early 1900's, but still, something pretty twisted.  Since Edward's a doctor, he makes her go to China with him as the country battles a cholera epidemic (and he volunteered to help).  What a husband!

Guess Naomi shouldn't have said she never really loved him.  Those were some hurtin' words.  Obviously he's bitter about his wife cheating on him, so this is basically his revenge.  Didn't quite make sense when the two were arguing and Edward said he'd get the divorce papers, only to change his mind a moment later and threaten Naomi that she must go to China with him.  I think that's how it went down- can't remember the precise details.

While in China the two basically ignore each other, sleep in separate rooms and only speak to each other occasionally due to Edward intially refusing to forgive and forget (that changes later).  They soon meet up with Toby Jones (a British man who never left) and a colonel (played by Anthony Wong Chau Sang) who's often reasonable with Edward's decisions considering the dire situation the Chinese are in at the time.  Meanwhile Toby can sense Naomi's in an unhappy relationship based on the way her husband never makes eye contact her, so for the longest time Naomi stays around the house or occasionally visits the town until she gets a job at the local church and plays piano/teaches the kids.

The setting takes place out in the mountains of China which is a part of the country I personally love!  So basically while Edward is trying to take care of sick people and finding ways to change the water supply so fresh water is being carried into town without much of a hassle (much to the dislike of the Chinese who apparently don't mind drinking contaminated water), Naomi is either stuck at home or helping kids in some way.  She's obviously miserable, but that doesn't stop her from trying to make the best of things.  Occasionally the cholera disease comes into the writing when we see deceased people either in bed or outside on the ground, and Naomi and Edward have to make sure they don't touch anything in case the disease might still be lingering around.

I won't spoil the ending but I guess looking back it's the best conclusion they could have.  You can't really put a positive spin on cholera though.  Basically Naomi gets pregnant with Liev's baby and well, I won't say anything else about it.  Obviously Edward isn't happy about it.  It's sort of funny whenever the one Chinese guard follows Naomi around, perhaps because the Chinese weren't on good terms with the British and Americans at the time (early 1900's) and probably thought Naomi was up to no good.

Overall this movie's really great but perhaps it could stand to have a little more substance.  It's definitely a light story.  Would have been nice to see Naomi get involved more with the town activities, or have the Chinese play a bigger role instead of being background characters.  At least near the end the Chinese ruler gets some time when Edward and Anthony pay him a visit (and it doesn't go too well for poor Edward trying to explain the horrible epidemic and the changes that need made only to find himself getting rejected).  Then again I've read some of this stuff in the movie isn't depicted properly.

The Painted Veil has its share of memorable scenes such as the Chinese teenagers chasing after Naomi after they realize she's British (who knows what they would have done had Edward not come to her rescue!) and later when more potentially infected Chinese come marching across the mountains and make themselves at home.  The first 20 minutes might be boring to some (and pretentious due to the acting) but after Naomi cheats on her husband the story changes in a big way.

This is a SPOILER but I couldn't help but think Naomi was clueless and didn't really understand the magnitude of cheating on her husband.  The final scene with her husband when the line ""I forgive you"" comes to mind.  Pretty sure the wrong person is uttering those words...

I admired the potraiture of people as people -- complex, determined, adaptable. I would recommend it for a view on these counts alone. The film is lacking in a few respects. The plot does not drive the film but complicates it. The politics involved with the military, villagers, warlords, etc. are distracting and prevent the emotional tensions between the two main characters from playing out in the foreground. The lack of a memorable scoring contributes to the overall lack of emotional punch to the movie.

The couple in this story must travel a cruel and bumpy road to reach a mutual love and respect for each other.

Edward Norton and Naomi Watts play this couple, Walter and Kitty Fane. I'll watch any movie these two are in and they are mesmerizing together in this film.

3141098,5,B001589S0E,"Producers Naomi Watts and Edward Norton deserve high praise for bringing this, the third movie version of Maugham's novel, to the screen. Equal praise is due them for their splendid acting in the leading roles. If anything, just as much praise might be due Ron Nyswaner for what could have very well been a thankless task  -  that of writing the screenplay. Those, including myself, who love Maugham's novel are poised to object to the changes Nyswaner made in order to make the novel work as a movie. And major changes are what he made, from adding significant events that do not appear in the book to giving the story a much happier, though not exactly happy, ending.  It's hard for me, as a non-professional to see how this works, but it goes along with my theory that writers of successful screen adaptations/screenplays are remarkably gifted. I think especially of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala for her work for the Merchant-Ivory team and Emma Thompson for her work on the Ang Lee production of ""Sense and Sensibility"".
The scenes added by Nyswaner to ""The Painted Veil"", especially the play at which Townsend first flirts with Kitty, the later encounter with the local Chinese warlord, and especially the euphoric completion of the ingenious aqueduct, are so rich and enjoyable and lend such depth to the overall result that they do not seem out of place.  The happier ending might be harder to justify, since it clearly goes against Maugham's intention, but with all the good will built up by that time, it's hard to be the curmudgeon who would object. I do not mean to leave out Liev Schreiber and Toby Jones, who are also perfect in their roles, or the remarkably apt use of music on the sound track, including one by Erik Satie. That the film is also very beautiful to look at hardly needs mentioning.",1430611200,,1803,4.714285714285714

3141134,5,B001589S0E,"I rarely rate a movie adaptation over its source material, but The Painted Veil leaves Somerset Maugham's original novel in the dust. The basic story, setting and characters are preserved: A British doctor, shattered by his wife's extra-marital affair, embarks on a suicide mission with her in tow to a cholera-plagued Chinese village, c. 1925. However, where the book consistently slaps the reader in the face and doesn't allow the characters to grow, the movie adds warmth, color and detail. It creates more political suspense, enhances the husband's character, and allows the couple to fall in love as the crisis situation intensifies.

At no point do the characters' journeys become saccharine or implausible. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts put in skillful, subtle performances of complex characters, and we become fully invested in their marriage. Toby Jones is no less excellent as the deputy commissioner who observes the couple with compassion and uncanny wisdom. The breathtaking Chinese landscape, shot on location, might also be considered a character in its own right.

The film is not perfect. There are a couple of awkward digressions into religion and politics. In particular, the adapters don't seem to understand how to approach the Catholic faith (which Maugham did understand, for all the other faults of the original book). There are also a couple of loose ends in the plot. But in the end, The Painted Veil is a powerful human story about love, forgiveness, and coming of age. It is Edward Norton's finest hour, and it is not to be missed.",1424476800,,1559,5.0859375

3141148,5,B001589S0E,"A beautiful film, engaging story and great cast in great performances.  Naomi Watts looks terrific, too ;)",1423958400,,106,5.235294117647059
3141149,5,B001589S0E,"The English word ""resent"" or ""resentment"" comes from the Old French resentir ""feel again, feel in turn"" (13c.) That is, to replay and feel again and again and again the thoughts and emotions relating to something negative that's already happened/affected you, as in visions of your wife having sex with another man and laughing at you.

This novel is Somerset Maugham's calamitous case study on the travesties begotten by a faithless, heartless and, frankly, gullible cheating wife, and of the cuckold's emotional pain and the overpowering poison of his resentment.

Kitty Fane ruthlessly ridicules her husband, Dr. Walter Fane, to her lover and dreams of marrying this cad who she cannot see is playing her. Though the husband Walter loves Kitty still, after he finds out of the affair, his selfish desire for revenge makes him decide to take her with him to the heart of the cholera epidemic in rural China where, ironically, he selflessly works around the clock to save these people.

Prior to departing for China, he asks her:
""How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode.""
***
""I know that you're selfish, selfish beyond words, and I know that you haven't the nerve of a rabbit, I know you're a liar and a humbug, I know that you're utterly contemptible. And the tragic part is'--her face was on a sudden distraught with pain--'the tragic part is that notwithstanding I love you with all my heart.""
*****

Nevertheless, off they go. Kitty awakens too late to the fallacy of her fantasy love and the spinelessness of her beau, who (get a hold of this) was really only interested in sex. Kitty undergoes self-discovery, finds her moral compass, and seeks forgiveness, while resentment threatens to consume Walter.

Maugham couldn't have found a more appropos place to explore the most disastrous tragedy to a marriage (an affair) and set up a plethora of symbols on the after-effects of infidelity to contrast with society's notions of a husband and wife, against the background theater of the mind running scenes of the ungrateful wife screwing another man and mocking her husband.

This is powerful, provocative stuff. A super potent movie.",1423958400,,2254,4.872062663185378

It is the only time I feel his trip helped the Chinese people.  The scene of negotiation with the warlord showed some of chinese culture known only to the Chinese.  The idea of the trip seemed suicidal.  I would have died of boredom in the shack with absolutely nothing to do or like. The neighbor guy at least knew their was an outlet from total dreariness. Interesting those mountains are from avatar movie. Walter was a nasty man with a low testosterone count.  The little boys face is clearly her lovers not Walters. Perhaps more punishment for her affair that her son will not have even the few good qualities Walter had.  I liked her but what a terrible social trap she lived in as many women still do .

I wanted to see it so badly that I even paid to watch it, since it was no longer available for free viewing on Prime.  She loved it, as well, which I was certain she would.  It has all the ingredients:  adapted from Somerset Maugham story; great actors - Edward Norton (1 of my favorites) and Naomi Watts; love, betrayal, true love discovered and the plot twist.

I was doing my chores and kept the movie running in the background. As the movie progresses, it captured my attention. I can identify myself with Kitty Fane. We were both spoiled brats and expected so much from our kind-hearted husbands. After the movie ended, like a successful therapy, I treated my husband differently. I tried not to be so demanding, and be a supportive wife. That's how much this movie has changed my life for the better. I have rewatched this movie many times since.

The historical references to British colonialism and the darkness it brought to much of Asia and the rest of the world is a tale worth paying attention to in our current times!",1407196800,,497,4.595505617977528

3141373,5,B001589S0E,"I first read the book when I was fifteen and have lost count of number of times I've re-read it. In most cases, especially when it comes to beloved books, one is cynical about movie adaptations of the same, especially if you are gifted/plagued by an overactive imagination. Somehow, the movie version is often a let down if in your imagination the settings were far more beautiful. I am happy to report that this is not the case with The Painted Veil. Every frame is set artfully with a graceful, timeless elegance, which was well thought out by the director. The actors are fantastic and costumes are perfect. The setting is changed from Hong Kong to Shanghai and the love angle in the story trends differently from the book but truth be told, it's a far more believable version and I infinitely preferred it after the initial 'eh, what?' knee jerk reaction. This is truly a well made adaptation of a great novel. A must watch and a must have for classic movie collectors!",1405641600,,973,4.597701149425287

3141407,5,B001589S0E,"This is the third movie adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel of the same name. This version, released in January of 2007, tells the story of a young woman, Kitty Fane, compellingly played by Naomi Watts, who has carefully avoided the painful job of growing up and acting like an adult.

Events conspire that compel her to move to China with her new husband, Dr. Walter Fane, played by Edward Norton, at a time when China was becoming increasingly involved in a  shift from war lords to a stronger national government. Along with that shift, a cholera epidemic demands her husband's full attention leaving Kitty to fend for herself which she does rather badly. After making her fair share of mistakes, Kitty begins to realize her need to grow up and start looking beyond her own needs and wants.

The scenery is both striking and alien looking; the filming took place in China. The acting and general ambience of the movie holds the viewers attention and creates an impression of depth and scope. The story was well crafted and made one feel the hand of a master literary craftsman had been involved in its creation.

Sadly there are no special features on this disc; one would think the making of this movie would deserve a lot of special attention and open many doors for interesting background information, but there is nothing on the making of this movie.

The movie is serious, intense, and very dramatic; although it is only rated PG-13 I would consider carefully before letting it be viewed by young children.",1400716800,,1525,4.761363636363637

3141438,4,B001589S0E,"This wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it. So the set up is that a woman marries someone she barely knows and doesn't quite love, she has an affair with a married man, but due to the time period (1920s) she finds herself trapped in the marriage. Because her husband knew of the affair, the marriage is now very strained and uncomfortable to watch at times. They move to a remote village in China so the husband can help with the cholera epidemic. It is here where the wife is forced to grow up and the couple has the time to learn about each other, and come to love each other. I wish this part of the story lasted longer and wonder if the book may have been more satisfactory in that department. The scenery, however, was spectacular. I have never much been interested in visiting China, but there is no way those mountain peaks don't capture your attention. And right along with that is the beautiful musical score. The cinematography and score were well suited to each other and just made you feel like were in the time and place. Overall, it was an interesting character study of two people and as a viewer I could easily feel the emotional ups and downs.",1398816000,,1176,4.423963133640553

I'll just say that all the positive comments are true -- in spades. I haven't seen this level of loving attention to detail in a film for 50 years. I have no idea why it didn't get nominated for an Oscar. Yet another travesty by the Academy -- that a beautiful, thoughtful, intelligent film like this was not recognized.

3141463,4,B001589S0E,"Virtually all stories begin with...""the stranger walked into town...""  Yours, ours, theirs....our challenges (conflicts) begin when we enter uncharted territory which may be a country, a group of strangers, the workplace or the human heart.  ""The Painted Veil"" succeeds brilliantly on two levels: it takes  Dr. Walter and Kitty Fane into rural China of 1925 with a cholera epidemic while simultaneously taking us into the wasteland of Kitty's heart:  Oscar Wilde said: the only thing worse than a loveless marriage is a marriage where only one partner loves the other.""  Walter loves Kitty but she is still locked into child-like selfishness and self-ignorance, casting here for an affair with Charles Townsend, there for her own safety and health, while her husband selflessly delves into helping cholera-infected Chinese peasants while locking away his love for Kitty...having given up hope.  Not incidentally, the music of ""Veil""  is absolutely wonderful, enhancing the story's imagery of every scene, doubling the force of its emotional intensity and intimacy.  Production design is sensitive, often using moving veils, ""noir"" lighting techniques where less becomes more thus allowing viewer to use his/her own imagination to live into the scene.  But the telling power of this film is it's ability to appear shallow with the Walter's sullen resentment of the family's ""dirty little secret"", while heroically plunging into his life's work which also plummets the depth of his love.....(see Corinthians I)  What I particularly loved was how the director kept me from knowing who was the protagonist, i.e., who must be transformed by the story's experience? until the last part of the film.  Entertains, holds you, pacey in spots while slowing in other parts to allow viewer time to absorb/experience the moment.  A fine film, worthy of owning, viewing multiple times.",1397260800,,1870,5.366438356164384

She has ecstatic exchanges when she engages in sex with her lover, yet has only loath bordering on hate with her husband. His character is stodgy, has flat emotions in daily life.  I wonder how long Kitty will remain single, chaste widow before she pursues fulfillment of her own sexual appetite again.

3141539,3,B001589S0E,"Like liverwurst, about every year or so I get a hankering for a period piece especially when it takes place in the dwindling light of the sunset of the British Empire.  The Painted Veil is definitely Saturday afternoon rainy day viewing.

It's 1920 and her doctor husband is dragging her the long way through the back roads of China.  Flashback two years and we meet Kitty at home where her well-to-do parents never miss a chance to worry out loud that their youngest daughter will soon be too old to find a man.  At a party they've arranged for a young doctor, Walter, to meet her he asks her to dance, followed by the hint of wooing in which he proclaims his love so of course they marry and end up in Shanghai.

While Walter works at the local clinic as an epidemiologist Kitty gets bored.  Lucky for philanderer Charlie Townsend.  Walter discovers the torrid affair and signs up for cholera camp taking his unhappy wife away from the city and into the hinterland where cholera is spreading almost as fast as nationalism.

The Empire's best days are behind it and things are literally going to s*** for everyone.  Throw in memories of Fitzcaraldo and a pinch of African Queen along with strong performances and a director's touch able to tell the story of catharsis and redemption through moving images more so than through dialogue and you get a sweet little picture with a satisfying ending.

This is a re-do of the Greta Garbo film of the same name released in 1934 and based on Somerset Maugham book.  I think I'd like to see the Great Garbo version.  So that means I'll have having liverwurst twice this year.",1393459200,,1617,4.576388888888889

3141595,5,B001589S0E,"The time is 1925, the place China. Dr. and Mrs. Walter Fane, having lived in Shanghai for two years, are traveling to a remote area of the country because of a cholera epidemic, despite the fact that Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is a bacteriologist, not a physician. He and Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) have lived in China since they were first married.

The trip to the cholera-infested village is a far cry from that of their arrival, as there is a palpable tension between them. It seems that Kitty was unfaithful to him with the Vice Consul of Shanghai, Charlie Townsend (Liev Schrieber). When Walter tells her of the epidemic he has volunteered to help with, she informs him that is no place for a woman, and refuses to go... until he tells her if she does not, he will file for divorce, which would be a heavy blow to her social position.

The Painted Veil, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, explores the relationship between Walter and Kitty against the backdrop of the epidemic. I've covered the story in more depth in my review of the book. When I saw there was a film, I was curious to know how well it was adapted to the screen.

The story has been fleshed out somewhat, of necessity, as the novel is in Kitty's POV, which does not tell us as much as we'd like of Walter and his mindset. I think the screenwriter bridged the gap rather well, and Edward Norton brings him to life, endearing him to me in a way the novel never did.

Naomi Watts plays Kitty well. She begins the film as a shallow, empty-headed woman whose sole goal in life is to be married, not for love but because it's the thing to do. She justifies her affair to herself because she doesn't love Walter, and she believes herself in love with Charlie. Well, Walter helps her to see Charlie for what he really is. Her journey is one of self-discovery. At the beginning, Walter loves her very much and she barely sees him, but over the course of the film, she comes to realize his true worth, as well as her own, as they find one another.

Can love make everything right? Unfortunately, some things are beyond its ability to heal, and the film has a bittersweet ending.

It is a well-done adaptation of the novel, and even though it romanticizes their relationship at the end, I think I prefer the changes, which make a potentially depressing film into a sad one. It may not be action-packed--Maugham's stories seldom are--but it possesses a definite depth of character. Look for Toby Jones (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) as Waddington, the Englishman that becomes Kitty's confidante in a strange land.

The cinematography is beautiful, and so is the music that is used in the soundtrack.

I highly recommend this film if you enjoy such films as The English Patient.",1393113600,,2743,4.538461538461538

3141598,4,B001589S0E,The story began with a family that took care of their children up to a certain age and then expected that privilege to pass on to a spouse. Along comes this man who is more than interested in your daughter but the feelings aren't mutual. She marries him anyway. Gets bored and finds companionship in the arms of another man who is likewise encumbered to a spouse. Of course they are found out. The husband who has been cheated on decides to go where the need is greater to help out a medical emergency that's way over his head and take her with him or offers her a divorce if the other man will leave his spouse and marry her. Of course he won't do that because it's not fair to his spouse to be dumped like that...lesson learned.. grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence... duh!!!

Love means to forgive and sticking by the vow you took of in sickness and health til death us part. The gift Naomi Watts gets for her commitment and renewed love is beyond measure, and I was touched by this. The scenery is almost unreal in its beauty! Wow... I bet it was great for cast and crew to film. I would definitely recommend this film, but KNOW it is slow paced and a love story.

3141872,5,B001589S0E,"I won't give much synopsis of this movie as there are others that have already done so excellently. Therefore, I will only mainly gush about how my limited ""movie genre horizons"" could have prevented me from missing out on one of a most amazing piece of film ever to have graced the screens.

Let me start off by saying that the one sentence summary of this movie immediately had me yawning. Typically love stories do not appeal to me. I think the last time I watched a love movie was right when the English Patient came out on VHS tape and two birds chasing each other outside my living room window looked more interesting to watch. That movie put a damper on any peak interest in the movie category. Fast forward to now. I came across this film and only clicked on it to read what it was all about because 886 reviewers got the film rated at 4.5 stars. I crossed my fingers hoping I will not have just wasted another precious few minutes of my life by giving this film my time of day and THEN I gave it a go!

DN DN DNNNNN.....WOW is ALL I really need to say about it!! But I'll gush a tad bit more!

The movie being about love is merely a fraction of the movie. Yes, it includes it. It serves as an underlying impetus for some of the main the actions that take place and the plot isn't focused on just lovers alone; it addresses many themes like compassion, forgiveness, understanding. The movie takes you through some of life's most important and most powerful emotions that which can make or break us. I took a liking to Edward Thornton's character. If Naomi Watt's character didn't fall in love with him in the end,  I CERTAINLY DID--for his larger than life role in the name of ""love"", and In the name of love from many aspects. I couldn't help but throw a tear in there too. AMAZING film!",1389830400,,1796,4.320474777448071
3141873,4,B001589S0E,"A study in conflict.  My main objection is that my sympathy--at least--went in one direction.  Is this what the author intended?  I grew quite impatient with the ""good doctor""--yes, his situation was sad--but his revenge belittled him, as his lack of emotional contact brought him into it in the first place.",1389830400,,308,5.0
3141874,5,B001589S0E,Very good movie.  Watched twice!  Told me girlfriend about it so she wanted to watch it with me.  Enjoyed it the second time also!,1389830400,,130,4.333333333333333

3141876,5,B001589S0E,"Having seen previews of this movie, we were anxious to see if the whole film lived up to the trailer. Set in 1920's rural China and based on the work of a famous novelist, we were not disappointed. Edward Norton and Naomi Watt portray real people with characteristics of tunnel vision, selfishness, pride, and integrity.... realistic depictions of normal humans who are often guided by emotions more than thought. The story evolves nicely into one of respect and love, even though the fairy tale happy ending is not available. The imagery of the countryside was magnificent, all while showing the despair of a backward people fighting disease, ignorance, political upheaval, and religious differences. We looked at each other when it was over and said, Wow, that was a great movie.",1389657600,,781,5.015384615384615

3141918,4,B001589S0E,"Certainly, this is a period piece where attention is paid to the norms and conventions which provide surfaces for the actions of the characters.  However, it is essentially a love story.  In something of a parallel to arranged marriages, the two protagonists marry for the wrong reasons and something of a disaster ensues.  However, through something of mutual discovery under difficult and demanding circumstances, attractive qualities become evident which trump the selfish motives that first impelled their union.  I suppose that this is a romantic story and one grounded in a generally positive, liberal view of humanity.  If we posit only the self and its aggressions and defenses as the only true purpose of existence, what do we teach our children?  How can we read any literature without scoffing?

3141944,5,B001589S0E,"I began this movie wandering if I would finish it because the summary did not sound particularly appealing to myself. However, I became interested from the get-go, and this movie never lost my attention. It may be a bit slow, but any faster and I do not believe it would be quite as moving. (If you watch it you will find out why.)

I have a close friend who is studying to be a doctor, as she wants to help people in remote places. And I haven't really considered/understood what her passions could entail. I am sure this movie does not begin to uncover tragedies around the world that could be fixed with simple things like clean drinking water, but nonetheless, it has opened my eyes.

Concerning the love interests in the film--I'm going to be honest--I became a heaping puddle of tears(which doesn't happen often) about halfway through after which my state only intensified. (i.e. laying on my couch weeping at 4 in the morning during a Christmas break) I should have started my break with this movie instead of ending with it. For people are imperfect/twisted, but there is hope because people can change. And this change can flourish; even if born in a harsh desert, it can grow.

Overall, ""The Painted Veil"" has reminded me about the problems of humanity and the impact of love and grace by and in caring for humans, by being selfless.",1388188800,,1343,4.610878661087866

It is not a traditional happy ending, but it provided enough for one of the main characters to figure out what real happiness looks and feels like.

For me the story was so touching and the acting by everyone in the movie was just so wonderful. Not only were Watts and Norton excellent, but Toby Jones and Diana Rigg characters were important observers of the troubled couple who got married for all the wrong reasons and then slowly fell in love for all the right reasons.

The music along with the scenery made for an enchanting backdrop.  I think S Maugham would have been quite pleased with this interpretation of his work.

I usually prefer older movies from the 1940s and  50s so to find a current movie that I love this much was a real treat (current being 2006),",1387324800,,779,4.26530612244898

I also was aware of the unchanging life of the other man, still a jerk at the end.  the child was a good lookalike of the husband.  The story was fairly fast moving with no dull footage at all.

3142059,5,B001589S0E,"General plot: Watts plays a self centered and spoiled young woman living off her fathers money whose family is pushing her to marry. Instead of going into an arranged marriage she tries her best to keep an upper hand by marrying Norton whos a doctor, head over heels for Watts and really her only way out. Norton hopes that Watts will one day come to love him even though hes boring, so we soon follow Watts into an affair with a married playboy. Norton is aware of the affair and gives her two choices, to divorce him for her lover or travel with him to China (where theres been an epidemic). The entire time, Norton carries himself very respectfully and amicably toward Watts despite her complete disregard for his feelings. While in China, we see both Watts and Norton grow individually and together into what becomes quite the unexpected romantic and self-sacrificing drama.
My opinion: The acting is diverse and pulls on many relatable emotional strings, despite being set in the 1920s. We come to love and admire both Watts and Norton and even more so together by the end of the film. The plot, dialogue and cinematography are all beautifully done and enchanting. If you like period pieces, are fan of the excellent cast of this movie or love anything drama this is the movie for you!",1384732800,,1290,4.662280701754386

3142080,4,B001589S0E,"Well cast, beautifully acted, lovely period clothing, cars, homes, etc. Edward Norton captures the personality of a dedicated scientist who falls for a spoiled beautiful woman, Naomi Watts, marries her and takes her with him to remote villages in China. Through their clumsy beginnings, the hurts and betrayals leave them bound to each other due to the time,1920's, and both are desperately unhappy. Through their daily existence in a strange land they each grow and learn from each other as Walter, played so very well by Edward Norton, treats a cholera epidemic. As a bacteriologist, he makes breakthrough discoveries. Kitty, played by Naomi Watts, begins to see Walter in a whole new light and through sheer boredom eventually wants to help at the orphanage. What begins as two people with their own demands and wants evolves into two people working to serve others who are in so very great need and in the process find their love and compassion for each other. A well done romantic drama.",1384300800,,992,4.946107784431137
3142081,3,B001589S0E,"Although I haven't read the source material, I assume it's good literature.  The elements for an excellent period love piece set in an unfamiliar stage are there.  The movie, in execution, however, falls short.  I felt that Edward Norton was wooden; Naomi Watts was only slightly better.  The best thing about the movie was the scenery/cinematography and the supporting cast.",1384128000,,375,5.2

3142089,5,B001589S0E,Stunningly beautiful cinematography!  A unlove story that uncovers the layers of a relationship torn by circumstances.  Amazing how such a well executed movie goes undiscovered.  We forget characters are acting.,1383696000,,211,5.966666666666667
3142090,4,B001589S0E,This was a good movie.  It's a romantic movie set some time ago in China when Cholera was still a problem.  Edward Norton takes his wife to a remote town in China whoes doctor has died in order to try to fight off an epidemic.,1383696000,,226,4.0
3142091,5,B001589S0E,"I think that some would consider this movie a ""chick-flick"" but its an excellent film regardless.  I have watched it several times and still think I have not fully understood all the different layers of Naomi Watts's character and especially Edward Norton's character.  There is a lot more to each of them then at first meets the eye.

There are a lot of reviews on here that go through the story pretty well and I don't like to spoil it for anyone so I'll just say that the movie has a lot to offer on emotional needs of people in their positions and how they both react to their marriage.  Naomi Watts and Edward Norton pulled off their characters beautifully and make it all very believable and well worth the time to watch.  The scenery is also spectacular.",1383609600,,761,4.4855072463768115

3142099,5,B001589S0E,"The essence of the virtue of forgiveness resulting in the reality that love can be developed and renewed is one lesson this film gives to those who may have taken the marriage vows for granted.  The portrayal of a married man whose selfish desire for gratifying himself by making women fall for him, crushing the woman's heart with his fake promises is a common phenomenon that is hard to comprehend.  The contrast of the sadness versus the happiness of the ending makes the viewer sigh with awe and jerking tears. A must see for women who enjoy watching adventures with romance.",1383436800,,579,4.7227722772277225

3142114,5,B001589S0E,"I loved this movie. It shows the reality of relationships and ""love"". As a man, I believe all men should give this movie a watch if you are at all interested in the opposite sex. The reality is, women are people too. The same way we love beauty, women love strength. We are all superficial at the end of the day, and should not rely on another person for your happiness or purpose. Edward Norton is in it, so everyone should watch it regardless.",1382918400,,445,4.309523809523809

Stay with it, even though at first the actors (especially Naomi Watts) might seem anachronistically contemporary, miscast . . They each work masterfully: they open their characters slowly, exposing layer after layer, and by the end each reveal fully rounded, suffering, loving, dignified people.

3142139,4,B001589S0E,I almost didn't' watch this movie. It started out like another dry English movie. A simple story with complex relationships. I have some issues on how the Chinese were treated in this movie but you have to consider the times. It's a testament to my philosophy that we learn the most about ourselves from our relationships.,1382140800,,322,4.767857142857143

Everything about this film captured the essence of Maugm's...and his revelations about the idiosyncrasies of human nature. Edward Norton's acting as the inexpressive Englishman was superb, this is one of his finest acting roles in my opinion portraying both the taciturn and yet emotionally torn husband . The rest of the cast including Naomi Watts was solid and faultless,  the musical score was enchanting lending an ethereal quality woven throughout the film and the script was deft and sharp.

Wow, were my expectations of this movie off base. This is a very well done, surprisingly gripping, medically-oriented drama set in the primitive Chinese ""outback"" in the mid 1920's. Mostly English with just enough tastefully selective subtitling of Chinese to keep things understandable, and a gripping story line dealing with an epic life or death battle against Cholera.

My understanding is that this has very little to do with the book, so the writing is really good and Edward Norton contributed to that. I love period pieces, and the cinematography was breathtaking, I wish I had seen it in the theatre. Naomi and Edward were excellent in their roles. Toby Jones is a favorite of mine, as I tend to watch more British productions than anything. This is very realistic, if you are squeamish about symptoms of illnesses, you are forewarned, but suck it up and watch this, it's definitely worth it.",1379721600,,624,4.482456140350878

I absolutely love this movie and can honestly say that Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are among my favorite actors/actresses.

3142262,5,B001589S0E,"The movie threatened at first to be one of those foreign films that has potential for greatness but the storyline gets diluted in the artsy takes and slow progression. However, it was NOT one of those films, and I was pleasantly surprised about how Naomi Watts, someone I've never had much opinion of either way, portrayed her character's half of this sad and moving relationship in which she marries Walter (Norton, always so good) when she does not love him. The dynamics shift from shy and respectful to tense and angry. Norton, while half the film he barely speaks, does a great job because we see how kind a man he is, but also how hurt. The whole thing was so good, but I was sad with the ending. Hard to get into details without spoiling it. I would watch it again for sure. A little too depressing to own it though. It reminds me of The Piano, only as far as the speed of the movie and melancholy feel.",1378684800,,910,4.358823529411764

The contrast between a shallow lusting love and the depth of getting to know a person's soul and learning to love them despite their imperfections was breathtaking. So amazing to watch them fall in love despite the tremendous pain. It truly reaffirmed that love such as this is possible!!! The scenery is spectacular and the supporting ensemble was every bit as talented as the two leads. It has become one of my most loved movies!!

3142278,5,B001589S0E,"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well....",1377907200,,1529,4.444444444444445
3142279,5,B001589S0E,"Naomi Watts and Edward Norton couldn't have played their roles any better and they also produced it.  They looked just the way they were described in the book.

One of the best movies I have ever seen.

After watching it the first time i couldn't get it out of my head, it is not often a movie like this comes along. In this movie you learn how things can change between two people, when at first you look at someone and you don't see the inner beauty and dismiss them, how taking a second look can change everything between you and them. It also shows that even after trust is broken it can be regained. There is also the lesson in there that if you are judging someone solely on the way the look and talk you may find that your eyes, and ears have deceived you.

Performances so nuanced, so utterly real and compassionate; this is a spectacular classic that can never and will never fade into irrelavence.  Naomi is in a league all her own and of course nails the complexity and simplicity of her character, making us both despise and adore her.  What's most stunning is Edward Norton's evolving persona, the layers he's able to peel away for all to see, his frailties, his stubborness, his human goodness and human rage; absolutely the finest performance of his career.  The story is set in breathtaking China, but it could have occurred in anyone's hometown anywhere in the world.  China's stunning landscape and its people tell their own beautiful, painful and harrowing history right along with our main characters.  I honestly believe w. Somerset Maugham would have thrilled and felt honored by this sensitive expression of his story.

The photography of China is spellbinding as it is compelling, illustrating the peaks and low places of human misery and joy (not happiness, mind you, but joy). Costuming is low key, not distracting from the real business of character study. The lighting always cues us to the hidden and explicit emotional landscape, not one which is white or innocent, but one filled with complexity and color.",1368144000,,662,5.365384615384615

3142372,5,B001589S0E,"In love stories, everything is wonderful, romantic and happy - or at least ends up that way. This is a thinking person's movie about marriage and, sadly, will not be appreciated by many. However, the growth of the characters within the arc of the story shows how respect, appreciation, and effort are required to make a marriage work. It doesn't just ""end up"" happy. Things change and you have to navigate through difficulties. The progress and solution for the curing of the cholera seems to me to be the metaphor for healing the diseased marriage between the main characters, Walter and Kitty - brilliantly played by Edward Norton and Naomi Watts. Gorgeous photography with challenging lighting techniques at every turn. Appropriately unusual film score. I would have never thought of the musical choices that Alexander Desplat made, but I found the music helpfully unobstrusive.",1366416000,,881,5.125

Fat chance! Every time I tried to focus on anything else, I found myself drawn back into this film, as scene after scene kept grabbing my full attention, leaving none to spare for chores and such.

I really like Edward Norton, but I was not expecting much from this movie and was quite surprised at how this slow-paced drama managed to keep my attention so fully as the tale unfolded.

3142399,4,B001589S0E,This is based on a classic by Somerset Maugham. It is a tragedy-type story and so is rather (but not completely) predictable. Because the setting is in an exotic/unusual place it is interesting in that sense. It was somewhat compelling. Worth watching,1365465600,,251,5.0

She was very selfish and uncaring when she accepted his proposal and was was not in love with him. She takes advantage of him at a time when her circumstances are less then desirable.

As the plot deepens, Kitty finds herself involved in an illicit love affair, is found out, and left heart broken.  Walter, crushed and disillusioned, decides to punish her by taking her with him to a village where the people are suffering with cholera. The beauty of the countryside near Shanghi where he lives and works engulfs you only to be totally destroyed by the stench of sickness and death in the traumatized village. The sick and dying people had to have clean water to stop the cholera outbreak and only the willingness of the remarkable doctor to bravely face the nationalist would bring this to frutatition.

Liev Schreiber played a cur so I can't say warm things about him, though he was pretty good as a cur.  The film was a total surprise as I don't remember it from 2007 and wondered why.  I just read a review that indicated it was passed over because it was a downer, focusing on the sin, malaria, and death.  But he missed the beauty of Somerset Maughams story which I loved for demonstrating the power of personal growth and forgiveness rising above human frailty.

3142463,5,B001589S0E,"I have watched this DVD many times.  The story is captivating.  China in 1925.  Turmoil and confusion.  The old meeting the new era.  The music is haunting and well suited for the movie.  In fact it is the outstanding part.  The story is of the maturing of a rather shallow young woman into a giving and thoughtful person.  The cholera epidemic of the 1920's in China is the focus.  The old ways giving way under modern science.  The turmoil of the Nationalist movement and its fight against foreign influence, perhaps to its own detriment in some aspects.  China's landscapes are different and very beautiful.  The cinematography award winning if I were giving out the awards.  Rembrandt lighting effect is certainly felt as the woman, having been very much at odds with her partner, openly expresses her new found love and respect for him.  The rest is  a story of personal tragedy and triumph.",1362355200,,896,4.764705882352941

I bought a new copy on DVD that must have been bootlegged or something.  It was terrible.  Since this is such a lush gorgeous movie, I felt it deserved the high price tag (for Americans anyway) for the Blu-Ray.  It did not disappoint.  Very good HD transfer overall.  If you really like this movie, I recommend shelling out for the this Blu-Ray.  If you haven't seen it yet, watch it on DVD first.",1360886400,,517,4.214285714285714
3142470,3,B001589S0E,"The film adaptation of the novel The Painted Veil starts off playing things pretty close to the novel, but then veers off in a rather unfortunate manner for my liking. Instead of continuing the story, there are deviations that at first seem unnecessary and then go way off the grid into full-blown distortions.

I realize that a movie that comes from a novel should be judged on its own merit. However, once you have read the book the movie is based on (and please spare me the semantic lesson), you feel compelled to compare. Comparing doesn't mean negation of one or the other. It only means that I see the pros and cons of both. Moreover, saying that one should ignore the source material when reviewing a secondary version is like saying one should ignore history lessons when reviewing a historical drama. One could require a critic to allow for a certain amount of artistic freedom, but to state that those freedoms shouldn't be taken into consideration when reviewing the overall product limits the discussion.

The Painted Veil is lovely to look at, a solid drama, and a well-acted. It moves well despite being over two hours in length and a character study, and is a pleasant enough indulgence. The casting in particular was nearly flawless (exception being Liev Schreiber as Charlie Townsend), especially with the subtle yet powerful performances from Norton and Watts.

The problem I have with TPV is that it differs so unnecessarily from the novel. The novel would've made a perfect movie just as it is, yet there were changes made that added subplots, scenes, and dialogue to the characters that run contrary to the way they were written, and more importantly, add nothing but empty contrivances. If one is going to make a movie that calls itself The Painted Veil and acknowledges the source of the characters, setting, and plot, what good does it do to make additions that do more harm to the source than benefit? Were these done to keep potential ADHD audience members awake, or was it done to pacify those who can't see the past as the past? In other words, were changes made to make the characters more appealing to 21st century viewers who might've been confused by the way people acted in the 1920s? Additionally, as one excellent review pointed out, the gist of the book is altered, e.g. Kitty's transformation is rendered as a mere quest for love. What a sad miscalculation on the part of the director/writer/producers.

In the end, I rate the movie about 3.5 stars and wonder how much better it could have been had they not felt the need to paint a bigger smile on the Mona Lisa.",1360713600,,2601,4.722466960352423

The story told of betrayal, understanding, and redemption comes alive as a great movie.  It has the feel of picture that is appreciated and honored.  It has none of the feel of a TV movie or a blockbuster but rather a well crafted and moving movie.  A doctor in the far east and his wife facing marital problems travel to a Chinese city in the grips of a Cholera epidemic.

You feel the heat and humidity, the dirt and smells, the palpable fear of death by an ugly disease, the tension of impending revolution.  The acting is outstanding, understated yet compelling.  The direction is taut yet languid.  The writing relies on the lost art of good storytelling.  The editing and cinematography are Oscar-caliber.

3142500,5,B001589S0E,"I've never written a review on a movie before but I feel I need to on this.  I love Edward Norton and after watching his interview on inside the actor's studio, I began searching for films that I haven't seen.  I had this in my watchlist and kept passing over it, thinking it was one of those ""classic, romantic and predictably unsatisfying"" love tragedies.  I am so happy that I decided to watch it.  It goes at a certain pace that I believe any other cast could not pull off.  Norton's character surprised me as he transformed from the starry eyed boy in love, to the betrayed bitter and downright cold shell of a man.  Over the two hours, he continued to surprise however, just when you think this guy is a total Bast*&^, he surprises you and carries you along on this emotional journey.  His wife, just as compelling of a character did the same.  You feel a certain distain and joy and tenderness throughout the movie for both of them, however polarized until the last half hour.

As I hate predicability, I I said to myself, this is going to end tragically as I was drawn in as though part of the story.  I will say, the ending, was not what I had expected and though tragic, very satisfying at the same time.

Brilliant and impressive that they both produced it.  Talent that leaves you in Awe!

3142530,5,B001589S0E,"So many movies nowadays focuses simply on lust and the brokenness in relationships with no direction and sometimes simply feed what's wrong with the modern view of love.  This movie focuses on the beauty of a relationship that wasn't perfect but was redeemed and ultimately saw real love.  In modern times, this couple would have simply divorced and been another contributor to the sad marriage statistic.  But set in the early 1900s, it brings you back to a time when adultery in marriage and divorce were not the casual affairs they are today.

Whenever I read books or watch movies of times past, even something like ""Pride and Prejudice"", it's a constant reminder that in the past people married quicker without the long drawn out dating process but somehow marriages lasted longer because it wasn't socially acceptable to simply divorce or leave your spouse. People were ""forced"" into commitment.  Our society cares so much about freedom that we forgot about commitment in a marriage to a person who isn't perfect and never will be but the relationship is worth fighting for because it can be beautiful in the end.",1351209600,,1119,4.8994708994708995

This movie was extremely well acted, the scenery was beautiful, and the dialogue smart.  I would watch this movie again and maybe even buy it, but I'm not sure this is an uplifting kind of film. However, it does make you feel good and think.  I would not say it is depressing, just not necessarily the traditional Hollywood-type ending some people might root for.

Before I watched this movie, I made the mistake of actually reading too many of these reviews.  I wanted to get a good gist of the movie.  It was nice that there were so many reviews for this film.  It was just sad because a lot of reviews went into great detail about the plot.  It was still interesting to watch this movie, even though the reviews kind of told me what would happen. However, if you have not read the synopsis, I would say just try watching the film for the first 5 minutes.  If you like the tone of the movie, it only gets better from there!

Naomi Watts does some really excellent acting here!  She plays a very believe-able Kitty.  I can totally see people I know in her.  Of course, the star is Edward Norton as Walter.  All of the supporting cast add value.  They make a very realistic period piece that has elements of relationships, which transcend into modern day.  This film is very subtle in examining a relationship between a man and woman, a woman and man's journey of self-discovery, and what is really important to people.",1344729600,,1579,4.442508710801394
3142557,3,B001589S0E,"Kitty (played by Naomi Watts) is a relatively attractive and somewhat spoiled girl with pretty much nothing to offer.  Walter (Ed Norton) is a young attractive doctor who specializes in the scientific study of infectious disease.  He is very mild mannered, reserved - not much of a talker.  He meets Kitty at a social function and is smitten. Kitty could take him or leave him - to her, one fellow is very much like another - basically she just wants to dance and go to plays.

Walter has volunteered to go to China and doesn't have time to woo Kitty, he asks her to marry him anyways knowing full well she is not smitten with him. In fact, she hardly knows him.

Kitty is given a rude awakening by her mother when she asks how long Kitty expects her father to continue supporting her. (Basically, we've raised you now get out.) Plus she overhears her mother on the phone talking about plans for her sisters wedding and saying no, she has no such expectations for Kitty the disappointing daughter...  So, in response to her mother's comments Kitty weds Walter and moves to China with him.

Kitty meets Charlie (an acquaintance of her husbands) and they end up having an affair (which is basically boring).  Walter discovers it and gives her an ultimatum - (A) he files for divorce charging her with adultery and naming Charlie as her lover or (B) she accompanies him to a remote area in China where there is a bad cholera outbreak and he is desperately needed (and their lives would be at risk from the disease)  She runs to Charlie and does not get the response she desired and so agrees to go to the cholera area instead of facing the scandal.

For 3/5ths of the movie, Kitty is not someone you feel any sympathy for really... and Walter isn't much better.  But finally in remote China, the struggle of being an unwanted westerner in China and the fight against cholera (and boredom for Kitty) Kitty is forced to grow up, become a better person, a useful person, and the two of them begin to grow close. They come to see each other in a new light and finally find real love.

There is some beautiful landscape footage when they are in remote China. The actress who plays the head of the French convent is wonderful, and their odd neighbor in remote China is also very good in his role. Both likable characters that help enrich the story, but after the first 3/5ths of the movie have gone.  I think a different actress might have been a better Kitty... Ed Norton did well with the somewhat dull role of Walter.

All in all, I guess it was an okay movie (I would imagine the book is much better) - I don't think you'll find this will enrich your life for the watching, but it was ok. My personal recommendation on this is to pass. There are many other entertaining and enriching movies out there.",1344643200,,2796,4.467583497053045

I have not read the book so I cannot comment on the movie as an adaptation, however I will say I just read the wikipedia article for the novel and I have to say the ending in the book sounds really unsatisfying and kind of horrible. The ending to this film is depressing true enough, but I think I prefer it to the book's story. Otherwise it sounds like it stayed pretty faithful to the original story.

3142564,4,B001589S0E,"If you are a W. Somerset Maugham fan then you may be disappointed because this movie (like many films) veers from some of the finer points of the novel. Having said that, I still found Naomi Watts and Edward Norton's adaptation to be a lovely film. Watts, Norton, and (Naomi's real life mate) Liev Schreiber, all give life to their characters.

Norton's character, Dr. Walter Fane,(a bacteriologist and intelligent but introverted man)falls in love with pretty, pampered, and vapid Kitty, while attending a party at her father's invitation. Dr. Fane is only in London a short time and loses no time in proposing marriage. It is the 1920s so Kitty, who is not particularly intelligent but very charming socially, accepts Walter's proposal - since her marriage options are growing slimmer. After a quick honeymoon, the couple settle down in Shanghai where Walter resumes his work. Kitty is soon bored with her new married life and has a careless affair with another man, Charlie (British Consul played by Schreiber). When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he's so infuriated, he threatens Kitty with divorce on grounds of adultery - which in this era of time could be social suicide. Walter issues an ultimatum; either Charlie agrees to divorce his wife and marry Kitty, or, Kitty will go with him to the inner regions of China to fight an awful Cholera epidemic

Charlie, being the womanizer that he is, wrangles his way out of the picture - declining to divorce his wife and marry Kitty. This is a pivotal point in an awakening of Kitty's self absorption but her character building still has a long way to go! The awkward silence and Walter's disdain of his wife as they travel the backroads to their new destination is painful to watch.

They arrive at their new home; a dismal house on the outskirts of the town and find themselves neighbors to another Brit, The Deputy Comissioner, Waddington, who is stationed there (played to perfection by Toby Jones). Waddington loves his indulgences from fine Scotch Whiskey to coupling with his paramour Wan Xi, a very young and beautiful Chinese woman who has followed him to this post. When Kitty and Walter end up at his home late one night, they all become more candid as the liquor flows and Kitty asks Waddington what Wan Xi sees in him. Waddington asks Wan Xi in Chinese and she replies, ""You're a good man."" When he translates this to Kitty we see her struggle with the young woman's answer as she flippantly replies, ""As if a woman has ever loved a man for his virtue."" But this obviously strikes another chord in Kitty's character as we see her begin to look at Walter differently.

As she finds herself bored and a little frightened in this new and strange place, Kitty begins volunteering her time at the city orphanage. It is run with efficiency and care by the Mother Superior, played with depth and compassion by Diana Rigg. There's a poignant quote by Rigg's character during a conversation with Kitty about marriage as the Nun speaks candidly of her ""husband"" (God), that will strike the heart of anyone in a long term relationship who also has an appreciation for the spiritual aspects of love itself. There's not as much of Kitty's character development in the movie but we still get an understanding of her desire and attempt to become a better person from the frivolous, and self serving young woman she's been most of her life.

Norton does a stellar job in his portrayal of Dr. Walter Fane and as is typical with Norton, his most effective moments are when he's not speaking his lines but in his nuances and mannerisms. He and Watts conjur up a chemistry that is at times mesmerizing. In this film, Walter is more forgiving in the end but it doesn't feel contrived.

Anthony Wong Chau Sang commands our attention as Colonel Yu, who at first, shows an obvious dislike for these intruders from the West, but develops a degree of respect and even appreciation, for Dr. Fane's selfless attempts to save Yu's people from the horrendous disease that is ravaging young and old.

The movie offers breath taking cinematography, authentic sets, and costumes. The story stays fairly true to the ending so have tissues handy, but the tweaking is believable and a tad less dismal than the novel.",1342310400,,4253,4.778231292517007

The movie moved at a slow pace but somehow was totally riveting! I couldn't peal my eyes from it and felt the pain and hurt from both main characters. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were amazing  and real. They were both somehow unlikable and loveable at the same time. A lot of other reviewers have given a play by play of the movie so I will not do that. This wasn't exactly a love story as much as it was two people finding themselves within each other. I don't know that I would watch it over and over again as it was not exactly uplifting, but it tugged at a heart string in a way that made me feel really truly connected to the story.

3142570,5,B001589S0E,"*This is my first review, so please forgive its imperfections*

I came across this film when scrolling through my video library on a rainy afternoon, and let me just say, if I judged a book strictly by its cover, I would have passed this without a second glance and forgotten it completely. Not that the DVD cover isn't stunning, depicting some enchanting Chinese scenery, but the image of a couple snuggling on a rowboat, I have to admit, had me sighing a little. I remember thinking, Oh God, this is going to be the Chinese version of Australia, a film that shoves some competent cinematography and landscape shots down your throat to distract from an eye-rollingly corny love story.

Again, if I was sold on appearences alone, I would have left this film in the dirt, but being a woman and having my weaknesses, I decided to try it out with the knowledge that Edward Norton (known for being choosy when taking roles) was the lead. I was prepared for a hackneyed romance told mainly through montages (one of my personal pet peeves) and some overdramatic music. I will say, the film DOES open in a somewhat typical fashion. Boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy marries girl, but ahhh, girl doesn't fall for boy. However, the film at this point veers dramatically from where one would expect a movie with said scenerio to head. The wife of Edward Norton's character, played in a wonderful turn by Naomi Watts, is vein, selfish, and unfaithful, but portrayed so as not to make her hateful to the audience. For some actors, this is easier than for others, and Watts shines in creating a beautifully rounded character that transforms from a spoiled daughter of high society to a devoted and powerful wife and woman. I'm going into as much detail as I am because the character development is one of the many great aspects of this film. Each character is written with as much virtue as flaw. No one is perfect, yet no one is unlikeable. Edward Norton is mesmerizing as he has been in every film I have ever seen him in. I truly believe this is one of his most powerful, and sadly underrated, performances. He pulls off a flawless accent and powerfully communicates the resentment he feels for his philandering wife, but what makes the perfomance memorable is how internal most of it is. Norton's eyes play as great a role as his mouth, for there is not a scene in this movie where his tortured betrayal is not evident. He and Watts play off each other with ease, which is ironic because a great chunk of this film has them at each others' throats. The movie boasts an outstanding supporting cast, including Liev Schreiber as the seductive albeit underlyingly slimy lover, Toby Jones (who I have never seen in a role this pivitol since) as the couple's neighbor and sort-of conscience, and the fabulous Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of the French convent. A lot of times in movies, the nun character is employed to offer sentimental words of wisdom, which Rigg does here, but her perfomance keeps the character from being cliche and she easily wins the best line of the film with her speech to Watts' character about faith and how it prevails with the help of love.

As much as I'm raving about the performances, I don't want this film to come across as one only watchable for its actors, because as I discovered within the first ten minutes of this nearly two hour picture, it has so much more to offer. Based on the 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham (which I understand takes a far less romantic turn in its finale than the film version), The Painted Veil tells the story of a shy, young bacteriologist named Walter Fane (Norton), who has returned from his work in China in hopes of taking a wife. He instantly falls for the beautiful but spoiled Kitty (Watts), and abruptly asks her for her hand in marriage. Accepting his proposal(for far less romantic reasons), Kitty is immediately disappointed in Walters' mundane lifestyle and his apparent lack of passion, and wastes no time in seeking it out elsewhere, namely the charming(and married) Charlie Townsend (Schreiber). The lovers are seperated, however, by Walter's discovery, who, as punishment for her behavior, drags Kitty along with him to a small Chinese Village (the name of which is escaping me at the moment) infested with a mammoth outbreak of Cholera. Walter volunteers to be the town's doctor, with the self-pitying Kitty confined to the solitude of their isolated home, her only company the being the non-english-speaking Chinese house-maid and their neighbor, Mr. Waddington, whom she comes to befriend. Walter, his fondness for Kitty now replaced with bitter distain, seeks refuge in his work, but runs into obstacles with the townspeople condemning him as a white imperialist good for nothing but corrupting their tradition. As the film progresses, it is the obstacles faced by the two individuals that bring them to a new understanding of themselves and their realizing that they are both at fault for the marriage's failure through both wanting the other to be something they aren't. The relationship between Walter and Kitty is both complex and beautiful. It undergoes several beatings, but ultimately prevails as one more powerful and romantic than I was prepared for. The love story avoids cliche by taking its time to really manifest itself, and by that I mean it truly had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation for the two characters to finally give in to their feelings. It is something special, as we watch two people, who become more than just characters but emalgums of both human frailty and strength, discover their ability to love. The third act of the film I will not elaborate on because I want everyone to experience it on their own, as well as the rest of a film that has criminally flown under the radar for far too long.

As one who compulsively studies film-making and the factors that determine its greatness, I will wrap up this review by complimenting the stunning production design of the movie. Every shot is strategically framed, pulling no distracting camera cuts like one might see in one of Scorsese's lesser films. And although this film, for me, earns the right to boast some unbelievable shots of the Chinese countryside, at no time does it rely on them to force a reaction. The word to describe this film, in its design atleast, is subtlety. The director, the cinematographer and the production designer let the film speak for itself in how wonderous it is, and Alexandre Desplat lets his score serve as a backdrop rather than a mood-setter. This film is a rare pleasure, and all I can say is I wish there were more out there with as much poise and tenderness as this one possesses. This is a film worth setting time aside to watch, because it is one that demands full attention in order for the viewer to full appreciate what it is trying to do, which is not to wack them over the head with its sentimentality, but rather cradle them with its quiet and tender beauty.",1339891200,,6979,4.7133497133497135

3142578,5,B001589S0E,"For what it's worth, I wish the film could live up to my designation of it, that being: ""instant classic."" I found the film to be a rich and rewarding experience, in that it demonstrated--and quite efficiently--redemptive love and forgiveness--and this after extreme betrayal was effected within the bonds of marriage. Without giving too much of the plot away (for those who haven't read the novel by W. Somerset Maugham) the film opens in 1920s China, in a rural province--the movie was filmed on location, thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers, who took it upon themselves to jump through various hoops to obtain all of the permits necessary to film in the country (a feat not achieved for an American-funded film in many years, as far as I know). A seemingly unhappy couple fills the first few frames, and we immediately get their back-story.

Dr. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is enamored with Kitty (Naomi Watts), the daughter of an affluent family, by all appearances, who he meets at a gala. Not much time passes before he asks the young beauty to marry him and return with him to Shanghai, where he holds a civil position as a scientist. Kitty is taken aback by his sudden boldness and is initially reluctant, until she overhears a telephone conversation her mother has with a friend, wherein she says--regarding Kitty's marriage prospects--""Oh, I gave up on Kitty long ago."" To escape the clutches of her overbearing mother, Kitty sets off to Shanghai with her new husband, but as blissful as the marriage seems in the beginning, things immediately go wrong.

For reasons I will not divulge, the nave Kitty is forced to travel with her husband to a remote region of China, where he has decided to volunteer his services in the fight against a cholera outbreak, as the disease has wreaked havoc and devastation on this part of the country. It is here that the film explores the deepest aspects of the two lead characters, and it is here that the healing process begins. We learn, along with the unhappy couple, that they were expecting things of each other that neither of them possessed in the first place; and each desired something in the other that that person couldn't supply. But eventually, the two learn to accept each other for who they are; and the connection between them soon becomes solid, and unmistakable. I should say that there is one crucial plot point--which carries us into the Third Act--that will conveniently upset the calm and keep us riveted until the final moments play out.

The performances are brilliant and highly believable, but this is more of an art house film than anything, so the average moviegoer will be sorely disappointed if he or she is expecting otherwise. The cinematography is breathtaking, and exquisite views of actual mainland China, with its distinctive misty mountain ranges, fill the background of many establishing shots. The set designers decided on various muted earth tones for many of the interior settings, and this causes the viewer to focus on the players moving about in the foreground, but whether this is in keeping with the period or not, I do not know. What I can say is that it works. I only mention this because many films that are set in the Orient tend to be extremely colorful, and this film is not, which is refreshing, as the subject matter and themes do not call for it.",1328918400,,3349,4.780656303972366

The story begins with a spoilt young woman wooed by a physician who takes her to China. When things get rough between them and she cheats on him, he takes her into the very depth of hell where cholera has spread and killed many.

The character development is stunning even in the movie. John Curran, the Director made a masterpiece never to be forgotten. No, it is not a ride with Bond or Underworld. It is soft and wonderful and full of manly anger and womanly wiles. It is a great novel made into an amazing movie.

3142582,2,B001589S0E,"Beautiful filming.  Incredible scenery.  But the transformation that is supposed to happen for the primary characters just doesn't work.  ""The Painted Veil"" is supposed to be a melodramatic realization film, where an infidelitous wife and scorned husband learn love and understanding (i.e. lifting the veil) amidst the harsh, deadly conditions of a cholera epidemic in China.  The problem is, the transformation, while framed adequately amongst suffering, squalor, and isolation is foreign and not believable, and the chemistry between the two (Edward Norton and Naomi Watts) just doesn't exist.  Which isn't to say they acted poorly.  On the contrary, their performances were decent, albeit a bit wooden.  What isn't decent, however, is the script.  Far too much is left hanging or unexplained; the flaws undermine the fine efforts otherwise, and just about everything else is as predictable as getting a wrong order at McDonalds.

Watching the film ends up being a lot like having cholera.  There is a definite timeline, but it feels like it lasts forever.  About 36 hours.  I felt drained because it moved so slow and wouldn't end.  Thankfully it did.  And I puked at least once.",1324857600,,1182,5.185185185185185

3142585,4,B001589S0E,"Several years ago I reviewed a film, Reds, about the torrid love affair between pre-World War I radical journalists John Reed and Louise Bryant where the Russian revolution of 1917 was used a backdrop for much of the story line. I commented then that that approach had the focus in reverse of what was compelling about the film, the love affair small against the backdrop of the great historic event that swept the pair up in its wake. I then stepped back and went on to tip my hat to the right of an artist to use whatever creative license was at hand in order to tell his or her story. Those same sentiments apply here where the film under review, a film based on British author W. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name, The Painted Veil, tells the story of another tortured love affair set against the backdrop of the Chinese revolution of 1925-27. Except here the revolution is even more of a background echo.

Of course the period in question, in the aftermath of the decimation of the flower of British youth of all classes in the devastation of World War I, is the period of the slow decline of the British Empire. That empire however still included a not unimportant outpost in tumultuous China. And the bulk of this story takes place there. And a rather old-fashioned Victorian story it is. A younger daughter of the upper-middle class under pressure to get married (and married properly, but mainly married), played by Naomi Watts, and a British civil servant doctor stationed in that British outpost in Shanghai and in need of a wife, played by Edward Norton, meet in London, get married despite barely knowing each other and leave for China. However , as is plain, this is not a marriage made in heaven, no way. Like many such arrangements it is merely a matter of convenience.

And that mismatch, that inevitable tension, is just the kind of plot line that Maugham was good at in previous efforts of his that I have viewed (and also read) The Razor's Edge and the more famous Of Human Bondage. The pair are trapped in a no man's land so, of course, someone has to stray off the reservation. In this case Ms. Watts has an affair with another British civil servant in order to get out from under. Said British civil servant already is married, very married, and in no mood to get divorced. Such stories clutter all of literature although not all are filled with perfidious civil servants with meal ticket wives as an excuse.

Naturally Mr. Norton stumbles onto the affair, ruefully offers a divorce under conditions that cannot be met, and so the unhappy couple are held together by some unholy glue as they are off to the outback in order to stem a cholera epidemic. And here is where Maugham's plot line shines. Through a very tortured set of ups and downs they actually come to under stand and love each other, although in the end it is only for one bright moment. Thus Maugham is forgiven, just this minute, for back-dropping the Chinese revolution. This is strictly an old-fashioned love story that may not appeal to the more modern sensibility, but it should.",1318636800,,3080,4.60655737704918

Since the book was written by one of our greatest English writers, Somerset Maugham, this is high praise for the film, indeed. Naomi Watts plays Kitty, a spoiled, beautiful English woman who marries a man she does not love, Walter Fane(played by Edward Norton). She has an affair at the first opportunity. Walter finds out and devises a particularly wicked revenge. How his revenge plays out is the main plot of the film.  The book follows a similar story line but the characters of Kitty and Walter are essentially unchanging, and their relationship is basically static as well. In the movie, Kitty, Walter, and their relationship evolve in a surprising, rewarding, and entirely believable manner. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are excellent as Kitty and Walter, and Toby Jones, Diana Riggs, and Liev Schrieber are a fine supporting cast.

He totally blew my mind away just as Ralph Fiennes did in The English Patient. China in the early 1920's provides the perfect background for such a wonderful story to unfold.

THE PAINTED VEIL is one of those stories that takes you slowly along for the journey. But that is not too say it is without context. There are many gentle, yet powerful messages woven throughout. One is set upon this emotional string of liking, then disliking, and then really feeling for the characters.

This is one of those ""you don't want to miss"" movies. If it is in book form, I would have loved to have read it for I have no doubt that if I had, it would have been one of those powerful, forget-me-not books.

I am still looking for that lengendary stylist from China in the late 1920's! [Buy it just for the haircut].

3142604,5,B001589S0E,"This movie has so many excellences. The cinematography and score are wonderful, and the performances of all the actors are so true to life. Not just the main characters but all the minor ones give stellar performances -- from the scornful Chinese officer who barely tolerate the imperial westerners in his country to Waddington, the dissipated but dedicated counsul, to the luminous Mother Superior and her charming nuns.  Even bit characters, such as the nameless servant who runs to fetch Waddington when Kitty can't deal with her packing up Walter's things, or the Manchu lover of Waddington turn in memorable performances.

Kitty and Walter are perfect in their portrayal of the bloodless husband concealing deep passions, and the shallow girl who married for escape and ultimately finds love.  Particularly memorable is how the movie portrays the fine line that can exist between love and hatred.

While the movie is slow, and a little predictable, the time that the book was written in demands this kind of slowness, and it lends the movie even more poignancy. Those who don't like classic literature or need a lot of action in their entertainment probably won't like this movie, but for those of us who like classic literature and historical movies the deliberate building up of the pace adds rather than detracts from the movie.  Particularly moving is the A la Clare Fontaine sequence, as Kitty leaves China.

I would have liked some extras on the DVD, but I suppose we can't have everything.

I seem drawn to this movie whenever I see it is on the schedule, (and it seems to be showing up on pay movie channels quite a bit).

If that all sounds a little Empire-ish and 20's-ish, so be it.  Maugham wrote the novel, after all, in 1925.  And if the characters are mostly walking cardboard, some very good actors give them a dash of life, including Naomi Watts as Kitty, Diana Rigg as Mother Superior, and -- especially -- Toby Jones as Waddington.  The on location settings are beautiful, and the film works nicely as a travelogue for journeys to the Chinese interior, assuming that epidemic has stayed quelled.

Having said that, the first part of the film meanders like a slow river, with most of the action in flashback. So perhaps an evening out of the two might have worked.

They really manage to capture the heat and conditions of the times, and Naomi Watts, while playing a selfish byotch of a character, really transforms in the course of the film in a believable manner. And as a result, he transforms in our eyes.

It amazes me how touching this story is. Here is this couple, a shallow, selfish, young woman and an idealistic, ambitious doctor, venturing forth to a strange new life in an equally strange world: Imperialist China circa the early 1900's. We watch the Naomi Watts character grow from god-awful, self-centered brat into a whole and remarkably mature woman. The beauty of the surroundings, the  subtle references to English Empire in its last phases, the curious neighbor played superbly by Toby Jones. And let's not forget the amazing, Edward Norton.

3142619,5,B001589S0E,"What a gorgeous movie -- the writing, the cinematogrophy, the score.  Watts, whose mother makes no bones about her desire for Watts to marry and leave home, does exactly this when she weds a man she does not love, awkward bacteriologist (Norton), and moves to Shanghai with him for his job.  While there, she meets charming, married womanizer (Schreiber) and the two begin an affair.  When Norton discovers this, he gives her an ultimatum: come with me into a cholera epidemic, or I will divorce you.  With no alternative, Watts follows him into a beautiful devastation; terribly sick and dying populace with a backdrop of gorgeous natural beauty.  In their time together, they discover things about themselves and one another that they weren't aware of at the start, and you slowly begin to care about characters that are generally unlikeable, or whom you felt indifferent towards, when you first met them.  Some reviewers found the movie predictable, but the ending could easily have been reversed, with a seperate set of emotional consequences that are interesting to ponder.  This movie left me thinking for days.  Based on a book by W. Somerset Maugham (who wrote the epic Of Human Bondage) and brilliantly acted by Watts and Norton -- who is always good and especially excellent in this adaptation -- this movie definitely has a lot going for it and is worth watching.  I wouldn't describe this as a romantic movie even though it is a love story, and my husband (Godfather-loving sports fanatic whose favorite movie is A Clockwork Orange and who had planned to fall asleep within the first ten minutes of viewing) enjoyed it very much as well, so men . . . don't judge this one by its cover.  Give it a try.",1235952000,,1713,4.776271186440678
3142620,4,B001589S0E,"Ed Norton and Naomi Watts both produced and starred in this 2006 adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel - it's clear from the vibrant opening shots set in a gorgeous Chinese valley that this is a labor of love for these two actors.

And indeed, ""labor of love"" is the prime theme of this film.  For while there is undeniably a love story at its root, but in this world, love must be fought for tooth and nail.  There are no breezy romances here.

Watts plays Kitty, a spoiled British spinster living under the crushing thumb of her mother.  Norton plays Walter, a bacteriologist who is more comfortable with a microscope than humans, but nevertheless has fallen for Kitty.  Following one of the oddest marriage proposals ever, Kitty and Walter head to Shang-hai, where Walter leads a colonial laboratory.

Incidentally, ""PV"" proves the old chestnut that England must be the most boring country in the world because no matter what odd corner of the world you find yourself in, there's probably a British doctor or explorer already there, setting up shop.

Bored out of her mind by the limited society of colonial Shang-hai, Kitty has an affair with the local consul, Charlie Townsend (Liev Shreiber, perfectly cast). Walter discovers the infidelity and, perhaps to punish Kitty, forces her to accompany him to the Chinese interior where he must fight an outbreak of cholera.

Here is where the movie really takes off.  Walter and Kitty, full of hatred for each other, nevertheless must keep up appearances in this gorgeous but plagued village.  With the help of the local British colonial advisor (Toby Jones), a French nun (Diana Rigg, awesome!) and the grudging help of the local Chinese commander (Anthony Wong), Walter fights to bring change to this rigid society.  The tranquil village is actually a powderkeg of nationalistic fervor, where the Western logical suggestion to move the cemetery away from the drinking water is greeted with rage rather than relief.

Watts, Norton, Jones, Rigg, Yu, and the rest of the cast throw themselves into this story with abandon - this is an actors' movie.  The script demands that the actors convey meaning with subtext, not the actual words - British and Chinese societies were too strict to allow for much plain speaking.  And in this movie, it works.

But this isn't a Great Film - the arc of the picture is fairly predictable, and one wishes that the movie's one true villain would get more of a comeuppance.  But these are minor quibbles - this is a very good movie and a must-see for any of the Merchant-Ivory fans out there.",1235174400,,2577,4.820454545454545

However, the exotic photography of this time and place enhances the story line.

The viewer may not entirely forget that Norton is from Columbia, Md., rather than the UK, but Norton brings the requisite reserved honor and decency to the story as Walter Fane, a cuckolded bacteriologist working to combat cholera and deal with the aftermath of his bored wife's adultery.

""The Painted Veil"" features apparently stock Maugham characters such as the Fanes' neighbor, a shabby British expat who knows the ropes in a lost corner of southern China, and lives with a Chinese woman, whose relationship to her is more complex than it appears on the surface and seems to have more true devotion than the Vane's difficult marriage.

This is the kind of film that may seem a bit formulaic on initial viewing but one that grows in the memory as highly recommendable. Days later I find myself thinking of Fane's slowly revealed honor both as a professional dealing with a region near collapse and dealing with a wife who betrays him but eventually sees her husband's strengths and the validity of emulating his efforts to help others.

China travelers will revel in this beautiful look at the countryside around Guilin, arguably the most beautiful part of China, known for its sharks-tooth limestone mountains famous in classic scroll paintings.",1232064000,,1475,4.959514170040486

3142634,5,B001589S0E,"Hollywood just can't leave well enough alone. Way back in 1925 Somerset Maugham wrote a truly forward-thinking feminist story about a vapid woman who comes to realize there's more to life than the empty fun that she's always craved and been led astray by. Ever since, Maugham's ending has been twisted by filmmakers to make it a second-chance-at-love romance. This version even adds a little Chinese political subplot that was entirely absent from the book. So the Chinese background gets modernized, while women are thrown back into love story land in the last reel.  So it goes.

But when a movie is this well put together, who cares?  The screenplay--despite my quibble with the direction the end takes--is very sharp.  The scenery is magnificent, and the acting is stellar.  Naomi Watts captures Kitty Fane's vapidity and makes her not just understandable but sympathetic.  Edward Norton is likewise great as her husband Walter, a man who in his anger at being cheated on decides to take them both on a suicide mission to a cholera-plagued area.  The supporting cast is excellent--especially Toby Jones and Diana Rigg.

The movie holds up to repeated viewings because the performances are so good, and the mood created by the director is mesmerizing.  Music plays a big part in its success.  The selective use of a piano piece by Satie is enhanced by a score that sounds as if Satie had composed the whole thing.  I actually scrambled to find out whether the waltz featured in the score was Satie's--it wasn't.  Just beautiful.

3142637,5,B001589S0E,"This 2006 film is the third movie adaptation of the 1925 novel by Somerset Maugham.  The film brings us back to that time and place where Brits were considered the good guys when they moved to China and tried to help the people.  It brought me right there too, being carried in a sedan chair, feeling the heat and the dust and the basic ""foreignness"" of China for the British characters.

Naomi Watts is cast in the role of a spoiled upper-class young woman who is pressured into marrying Edward Norton, a do-gooder British bacteriologist who lives in Shanghai and is looking for a bride.  He plays the role as a well-meaning, but uptight and stuffy man without an ounce of romantic appeal.  Not surprisingly, his bride is soon having an affair with Liev Schreiber, a businessman and diplomat married to a very socially prominent woman.  When Norton finds out about the affair, he is furious, and, as Liev Schreiber has no intention of leaving his wife, Watts is forced to go with her husband to the interior of China where there is a raging Cholera epidemic.

Against the backdrop of this serious disease which is ravaging the countryside, this marriage is displayed with all its faults.  Watts hates her husband who is doing his best to help the people who don't understand why he denies them their water supply or why he insists that the dead must be buried immediately.  Norton works day and night to help the people, even creating an irrigation system and making peace with the local warlord.  Watts starts to work in an orphanage run by nuns and she begins to soften towards her husband.  Eventually, they fall in love and there seems to be happiness in spite of all the disease around them as well as lots of anti-British feelings.  Then tragedy strikes.

I loved this film. I thought the acting was outstanding.  I felt the reality of the China that Somerset Maugham described in 1925.  And I really related to the story.  This film did not get very good reviews when it came out.  It was thought to be too old fashioned for a modern audience.  To me, however, this film was first rate.",1219968000,,2094,4.598382749326146

If not, she must come with him to a corner of China where an epidemic of Cholera is raging and there is no doctor. Take it or leave it, he says. She takes it - very reluctantly.

I had this movie sitting on the shelf, kept passing it by to watch others.  Wow, I LOVED this movie!  It was so good, so wonderful.  Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were spectacular!  What took me so long to watch and totally enjoy?  I was INSTANTLY immersed in this movie.

The scenery is breath-taking, the plot great. Set in the 1920's, Watts and Norton, marry -- she to please her parents and to basically get out of their house.  Norton is taken with Watts and is in love with her.  But, ALAS!  He doesn't know how to show his love and he is too deeply involved in his work in the medical field to realize he is shutting his wife out.  She gets involved in an affair with one of their friends.

Norton finds out, and to me, it seemed out of resentment, he takes a job in China to help fight a cholera epidemic.  Wow, how nasty and awful this place is.  While Norton is loving being there, having the medical time of his life, Watts HATES it there.  To make matters worse, Norton is full of resentment and punishes Watts by ignoring her and being mean and nasty.  Watts seems to be slowly going out of her mind, being in a foreign place, full of disease, political uprisings, dangerous situations!

We are taken through this village fighting cholera and the marriage and relationship of Norton and Watts.  Diana Rigg as Mother Superior was wonderful, she is a superb actress.

The movie is a tear-jerker but well worth every kleenex.  The ending is sad and leaves a lesson learned -- don't waste time playing games with those you love.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie, although I am probably one of the last people in the world to just have seen it.  If you are in the small minority of people like me who have not seen this movie, PLEASE check it out.  You will love it.  Watts and Norton are such good actors and the movie is wonderful.

Based on the book by W. Somerset Maugham. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton bring to life a poignant and evolving relationship, between a stern, awkward young doctor and his spoiled bride. A haunting score compliments their understated performances, brilliantly set in south China. Their story unfolds, a story of a faithless bride, caught by her husband and forced to follow him to a cholera outbreak, and ultimately, the restoration of their relationship to a level far deeper than ever before.

The tensions in the air are beautiful, and the development and growth in the characters are refreshing. Excellent score! I just leave the DVD menu running, and listen to that one song over and over. But the Painted Veil would be moving even as a silent film.",1214438400,,899,4.7935483870967746

3142648,5,B001589S0E,The Painted Veil never got the attention it deserves.  The plot is simple but the movie is about the unveiling of 2 people layer by layer.  Much of the praise goes to Watts and Norton for showing the many sides of their characters in a subtle way.  There are no huge crying or screaming scenes.  It is never overacted but the characters remain compelling.  I would have liked to see more about the politics of the Cholera epidemic at the time since it is an interesting event. That is a small criticism though and doesn't diminish the quality of the movie.,1212451200,,556,4.465346534653466
3142649,5,B001589S0E,"Watched this one all impressed by superior acting of the two stars, but really it's hard to imagine why they decided to make this particular story, it's so old fashioned and after awhile you have to ask yourself, are we supposed to admire these British people, their position in China seems anomalous and just plain wrong, I found myself cheering when the Chinese youths decided to menace Naomi Watts and knocked her out of her howdah in the crowded alleys of the town.  Maybe that's mean spirited of me, but then again the film seems to recognize the problems of its raison d'etre on more than one occasion.  Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) comes home all thrilled by the good charitable work Diana Rigg and the other nuns are doing, but Walter (Ed Norton) sets her straight with a grim, they're stealing babies to turn them into Catholics.  You can see that Kitty doesn't think that such a bad idea after all.  Then there's the pre-teen Chinese orphan who refuses to answer to her Western name.  Good for her!  And what about that Chinese attache general or whatever he was, could they have picked someone who looks less Asian?  Love to see an Eastern telling of THE PAINTED VEIL, I guess the Ron Howard movie of a few years back, GUNG HO, would be the nearest equivalent.

But whatever qualms I have about the movie, Watts and Norton are fantastic, and in Norton's marvelous nude scene there's one trick I never thought I'd see captured on film.  He's waking up having made love to his wife after many years of treating her coldly, and he's trying to sneak out of her bedroom without waking her, and we see him retreating away from the camera and then Watts speaks, startling him to such a degree we see him freeze and yet his buttocks quiver, delicately, magnificently.  Was this CGI or just more of that Oscar worthy Norton total command of the body?  Whatever it is, he should do it in every movie and perhaps on one of those old fashioned whistle-stop trains that used to bring politicans to every city in the nation, and he could step out on a bunting-lined caboose at every stop and show the folks what fine acting is really all about.",1212278400,,2137,4.5390625

3142651,5,B001589S0E,"This amazing film is based on the Somerset Maugham novel of the same name. (And, being based on Maugham, you know this ain't gonna end well, right?) Set in the 1920s, The Painted Veil tells the story of Kitty (Watts), a beautiful young woman who, as our story begins, is yet unmarried. Just as Kitty is feeling increasing pressure from her family to wed, Walter Fane (Norton) walks into her life. Fane is a brilliant, quiet bacteriologist who is currently working in Shanghai. Fane is quickly infatuated with Kitty, and he promptly asks her to marry him. Kitty agrees (due to a variety of reasons), and the two are wed and travel to China together.

Once in China, however, the couple's differences sharpen. Kitty finds comfort in the arms of a lover, and when Walter discovers her transgression, he confronts her. Walter's terms are simple: 1.) He can divorce her publicly for adultery, ruining her reputation; 2.) She can join him in a small Chinese village where he has agreed to serve as a doctor. (The village is battling an awful cholera epidemic.)

Kitty finds herself traveling to the Chinese countryside with her husband. The stench of adultery hangs palpably between them, and the two seem to despise each other. However, over time, Kitty and Walter begin to rediscover themselves and each other, leading to a conclusion that is redemptive and (in some ways) affirmative of the capacity of the human spirit.

This is an amazing, character-driven film. Performances by Watts and Norton, which make up the bulk of the screen-time, are unbelievable. Kitty is initially rendered as a slightly shallow woman who really doesn't know herself. She has not concerned herself with anything that is not about her. She chooses to marry Walter because she wants to get away from her mother and because she's beginnig to feel it necessary to marry SOMEONE to satisfy her family. However, as the film continues, Kitty grows up. She begins to think of the world outside of herself. She begins to yearn for a useful life.

Walter, a serious scientist, is not a social person. But he sees Kitty and is drawn to her. His need to be back in China is pressing, so he rushes an awkward courtship and proposes. There is much more to Walter, however, than Norton initially lets us see. His intelligence, his astute conclusions about human nature, his capacity for vengeance, his capacity for forgiveness. There are no flat characters here. These are intriguing, real, flawed people, and they are fascinating to watch.

Panoramic shots of the varied landscape of China are beautifully done, and the costumes are wonderful. The real show, though, is the evolving relationship between Kitty and Walter.

3142654,5,B001589S0E,"There are some films that are so good, that I hesitate to review them since any review would come short in conveying the exceptional quality of the production. The Painted Veil is this type of film. It just could not be better. The acting is superb.  The Chinese scenery and settings, the costumes (especially for Naomi Watts), and the art direction are of the highest quality. The music, often offering us variations of Eric Satie's compositions, complimented the feeling of the remote Chinese countryside. Yet it is the underlying novel by W. Somerset Maugham and the terse screenplay presented here, that is the bedrock upon which this excellent production is built.

The storyline weaves a tale of ever changing relationships and the bonds created, broken, and recreated. Kitty is a spoiled, bored, self-centered yet beautiful young woman who lives with her parents. She is a bit late in selecting a husband and her parents become increasingly biting and pushy in their comments that she should marry. A young infectious disease specialist, Walter Fine, comes to a family party, where he falls for Kitty. Beside beauty and physical grace, she has an off-handed frankness that could be seen as attractive. Walter falls for her and she is casually amused by him. However her mother's overbearing nature eventually helps tip the scales and Kitty marries this shy, bright, but naive young man. Since he is in the public health division of the English civil service, he is soon assigned to Shanghai China and Kitty must go with him. She is soon bored and they find they have little in common. He reads and studies and she plays cards and games. He does his best to amuse her. He is a bit shy in regard to love making, preferring to make love in the dark. The stage is being set for a major problem. The problem arrives with an invitation to the Vice-Consul's home for a dinner party. Here Kitty meets charming Charlie (played well by Liv Schreiber)and soon becomes his lover. Walter comes home unexpectedly and hears them making love behind her locked bedroom door. He leaves a record album he has purchased for her beside the door, a simple message to her that he knows what she has done. Dr. Fine accepts a terrible risky assignment to go deep into the Chinese countryside to deal with a cholera epidemic. He tells Kitty she must come too. She refuses. He then tells her that he will begin divorce proceedings the next day. In 1925 a woman divorced by her husband for adultery would ruin her social and economic status and stability. She is really forced into the situation of going into a disease infested remote area. She tries to get Charlie to divorce his wife and marry her, but he will have none of it and thus Kitty sees that he is a handsome and charming playboy, but has no intention of disrupting the relationship with his rich, sophisticated wife.

Thus Kitty agrees to go with Walter in a bleak pact that has a feeling of mutual destruction. It is in this backwater site of poverty and disease that the husband and wife actually begin to know each other. Walter has come to the conclusion that Kitty is terminally shallow, bored, spoiled, and self absorbed. However a series of events, some tragic, begin to unfold that both allow Kitty to develop beyond her own self-centeredness and to discover within herself some self worth based on service to others.

Toby Jones plays a remote English official who reveals to Kitty the reality of her relationship with Charlie, a superficial tryst and not a life long commitment. Diana Rigg is superb as the French Mother Superior of a Catholic school, hospital, and orphanage, who guides Kitty gently toward self examination, commitment to others rather than to oneself, and eventually to the talents and intellectual compassion of her husband.

Here the themes of the film become almost profound as it explores whether it is possible to fall in love with the underlying goodness of a person.  Kitty gradually begins to appreciate the dedication of her husband to public health and the masses suffering from infectious diseases. However, despite his busy and demanding life, Dr. Fine begins to appreciate Kitty's growing dedication to the French nuns and the work in the orphanage school. As their appreciation for each other grows, tensions between Chinese nationalists and the English also grow and erupt violently. Walter saves Kitty from a band of Chinese ruffians. It is here that Kitty discovers she is two months pregnant and the father is probably Charlie, not Walter.  They have reconciled enough at this point that he accepts this fact and Walter really forgives any and all of Kitty's past indiscretions. Yet at this time his public health strategies have begun to turn the tide on the cholera epidemic and the death rate drops dramatically in the village. Unfortunately good news spreads and the people from a neighboring village also stricken by Cholera invade the village and must be pushed back into a refugee camp. Here Walter works to bring the disease under control but becomes ill himself. Kitty comes to the refugee camp and nurses Walter, but it is impossible to keep him hydrated. He awakens from his coma and calls to her, she is sleeping beside him, and he asks for her forgiveness. At this point we see that he has also grown, for he has moved from the victimized husband with the unfaithful wife to a realization that he has pulled them both into a suicide mission and he has assumed he can punish her for the pain she caused him. It is now Walter than needs forgiveness. The film is excellent in teaching us that when the victim becomes the oppressor that they must first overcome the pain and righteous indignation before they can begin to empathize with those they have decided to punish. The final step is more sublime for after empathy can come the final step of realization that we all are capable of victimizing and oppressing others in the name of revenge and to justify our pain. Asking for forgiveness breaks the cycle. Walter breaks the cycle and releases Kitty to be fully human.

Bravo for such an excellent and moving film. The entire production takes Maugham's fantastic novel and polishes it into a glowing gem, possibly the best film made in 2007.",1208649600,,6243,4.795539033457249
3142655,5,B001589S0E,"I see this film as a love story, and probably one of the most complicated, realistic and poignant ones I've seen in a while. Instead of two characters who meet, fall in love, and live happily ever after, Kitty and Walter take a much more difficult journey.

Aging playgirl Kitty (Naomi Watts) and nerdy doctor Walter (Edward Norton) marry for all the wrong reasons. Walter's feelings for Kitty are based more on infatuation then on genuine love and respect, and Kitty simply seems to see Walter as a way to escape her family and avoid becoming a spinster. After Kitty has an affair, Walter makes an ultimatum that destroy's Kitty's relationship with her lover, and sends them both to rural China on a mission that is likely to cause one or both of them to die of cholera. The two characters are both so hopelessly disillusioned and depressed at that point that neither seems to care.

Strangely, what is meant to be a bitter ending transforms into a hopeful beginning. Isolated and living in miserable conditions, Kitty and Walter are somehow able to find a sense of purpose and a true appreciation for one another. It's as if the characters first have to despise one another for who they are not before they can love each other for who they are.

""The Painted Veil"" is a literate, sophisticated love story for adults, that features beautiful cinematography and wonderful performances by two of the best lead actors in film today.",1208390400,,1430,4.734939759036145
3142656,5,B001589S0E,"From the trailers this looked like another stuffy, boring Merchant/Ivory plodder, but NO!

It does start slow, but it has to set up the characters. Naomi Watts' character is shallow, immature, self-centered and pretty much a parasite living off her parents.

Since everyone else has synopsized the story,I won't. But give it a chance, it really gets speeding along and is completely unpredictable. I couldn't tell where the plot would take us.

The cinematography is stunning! Having been to Asia and having an airport lay over in Hong Kong I could feel the sticky heat of southern China just watching this movie and I felt myself drawn in. Even if you've never been to Asia, just the camera work and set decoration makes you think you're overseas and back in the 1920's.

One terrible line of dialogue though that slipped through: Naomi Watts tells her husband she's pregnant. His reply, ""With a baby?"" (Well, duh, yeah!) I'm not sure I heard that line right. I'll  have to watch the movie again.

Anyway, pure adult entertainment. You have to be patient, listen to the story, a generous helping of sexual content. Highly recommended! I'll end up watching this one at least 10 times.",1208304000,,1184,4.836633663366337

3142662,5,B001589S0E,"""The Painted Veil"" is a remarkable movie. From the first haunting notes of Eric Satie's ""Gnossienne"" to the last plaintive chanson in which we hear the voice of Kitty (Naomi Watts) promising never to forget, the viewer will be mesmerized. Music, in fact, is integral to the story: the Satie piece, which recalls the first encounter of Kitty and Walter (Edward Norton) in an elegant London salon, becomes metaphorical of their troubled marriage as she plunks it out on an out-of-tune upright piano in a rundown convent in China of the 1920s.

The beautifully understated performances of Watts and Norton underscore the complexity of Maugham's seemingly simple story. Particularly notable is the poignant performance of Diana Rigg as the elderly Mother Superior whose own marriage to god has become strained by too many years in the unforgiving climate of rural China, ravaged not only by warring factions but also by cholera.

The lush silk dresses worn by Watts evoke a bygone era, and the superb cinematography transforms what one suspects is smog into a seemingly painted backdrop of looming mist-enshrouded crags that appear to hover between earth and sky, just as the fates of the characters hover between life and death.",1205712000,,1225,5.08955223880597
3142663,5,B001589S0E,"It's Shanghai in 1925.  Kitty (Naomi Watts) has just rashly married soft-spoken bacteriologist Walter (Edward Norton) to escape her domineering mother. They immediately leave London, scarcely knowing one another.

  Kitty, who is rather shallow and likes games, has little in common with the quiet, cerebral Walter, who is work-obsessed.  She naively believes her new lover, the British Consul (Lev Schreiber) will leave HIS wife for her.  Of course he won't and of course Walter discovers the affair.
In retribution, Walter drags Kitty overland to a cholera epidemic zone, where he struggles to help the suffering locals while making Kitty suffer for her adulteries.

Both characters discover new inner strengths and gradually learn to tolerate, respect, and even forgive each other, as the disease cuts a swathe through the local population.

Magnificent cinematography, authentic Mandarin dialogue and accent, and a great screenplay augment Norton's finest acting job to date.  Support from Toby Jones and Diana Rigg is extraordinary.  Curran directs the Somerset Maugham novel well.

This film is beautiful, gripping, subtle, and worth multiple watchings--so don't hesitate to buy and add to your collection, cinephile or not.

3142664,5,B001589S0E,"""The Painted Veil"" is one of those films that enchant and insinuate their way into your emotions and haunt and haunt. As there are excellent reviews on this page, I did not plan to write one, but without committing to paper, this movie is not going to leave me.

Naomi Watts and Ed Norton are perfectly cast. Is there a story in real life about them? They also co-produced this film based on the novel by the great English writer, Somerset Maugham. Mostly set in China before the Communist Revolution, the story revolves around cholera and its devastating effects on local communities.

But Ed's character, Dr. Walter Fane, and Naomi's, Kitty, come by way of England, where he meets her at a party at her parents' house. She has passed that age when a woman should be comfortably ensconced in her own home and family, but Kitty has commitment phobia. A bacteriologist by career, Dr. Fane is home on leave and possibly seeking a wife. Finally, he convinces Kitty to marry him and they move to China.

In China, one night they attend a Chinese opera with friends of his and she begins an affair with Liev Shrieber's character not long after.  Walter knows and accepts an assignment in the country which needs medical assistance to fight cholera. That's when everything completely unravels in this emotional turmoil set against the physical turmoil of cholera. He treats her like poison and she retreats into herself, a horrible position for such a social woman.

Walter is much too serious and becomes knife-sharp, like his extremely bony body. Now totally socially dependent on her husband, Kitty must reach outside herself if she is to survive. Kitty is invited for tea by the Mother Superior of a nearby orphange. She is a woman of deep wisdom who teaches Kitty how to give of herself, how to really sacrifice and love. Step by step Kitty grows a bit and a bit more, until she volunteers full-time to help the nuns with the children, doing what she knows best, playing piano and teaching songs. During this service she learns the things her husband has been doing, what he is really like, and the depth of character and passion that she has been blind to.

When Kitty begins to reach out to Walter and see him for who he is, he begins to blossom out of himself and under her eyes. The little physical actions of these two actors make this movie: how his hardened face softens and glows from within, how her soft, sinuous body moves toward him. It is a joy to behold watching their emotions and their bodies gradually awaken to each other.

The cinematography shows a lush China, a lush relationship between the government official across the way and his Chinese concubine. Other parallels: the sacrifice of the nuns and Kitty's sacrifice for her husband, emotional turmoil and physical turmoil. The revolt against marriage through adultery with the upcoming Chinese revolt. The ways of a good writer are relentless and show in this beautifully rendered film.

Love and redemption, grace and forgiveness, sincerity and sacrifice--all fine things in the hands of skilled writers and movie makers. ""The Painted Veil"" is a must-see film for the thoughtful person.",1205020800,,3160,4.795955882352941

The score is also excellent. A perfect accompaniment to the film, but a soundtrack that stands up in it's own right too.

3142669,5,B001589S0E,"Never having read this particular Maugham novel, I was very happily surprised by so much of this film.  First, that Edward Norton and Naomi Watts produced the film, and played in it together as if learning to dance...awkward together at first and out of necessity for Kate; then they ""change partners""; Kate to adultry, Walter to his bacteria; Walter the typical scientific geek; serious, brilliant, somewhat cold and fearful when necessary.  As the movie progresses the cinematic views are incredible!  What a beautiful country this was filmed in.  The hills, meadows, rivers - simply breathtaking.  One of my favorite British actors, Toby Jones of Elizabeth I and Infamous, plays their new and only English speaking neighbor in a small village where a horrible outbreak of cholera pulls Walter to inner China, taking along his petite but healthy wife, Naomi Watts, Kate, on the condition that she goes with him or he divorces her for her adulturous affair with a person she barely knows (Liev Schreiber) but met in Shanghai after marrying Walter (which she did to get away from her mother).  At this point we get to meet nuns played by actors I will look for in the future, and a General I want to see in more movies, as well as Kate's ""protector"" who doesn't really speak but is just adorable!

Their personalities are so different, and they do not know each other at all.  In a way, their neighbor, sensing Kate's tension and sadness, helps to find her something to keep her busy and to put Kate right in Walter's daily path.  All of these things are going on as the ""Nationalists"" begin uprising against the British for being in their country even though Walter is there to do nothing but help and save lives, and even Kate finds a way with her neighbor's assistance to help.  The movie is 1920's, very proper, educational, incredible scenery and Edward Norton just keeps on getting better and better in every successive role, as does Ms. Watts.  The film is captivating.  I have watched it at least ten times and still don't tire of it.  If you enjoy the British accent and want to see beautiful scenery overclouded by the horrors of cholera, and watch a young couple survive a completely irrational marriage, then this will keep you enthralled for a couple of hours if not more.

3142670,5,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil (starring Naomi Watts and Edward Norton) is a stunning film. The story, based on a novel by W. Somerset Maugham, takes place during a cholera epidemic in 1925 China, but it's a timeless story and, with the outbreak of infectious disease angle, the film feels remarkably current. The cinematography and acting are superb and apart from some clunky editing the movie is altogether brilliant.

But what makes the film so striking to me is its honesty about life. The characters are flawed but real, multi-dimensional and struggling with misconceptions about others, a deep need to love and be loved, and a quiet urge to live a life that matters.

Watch this movie but don't study it. Let it draw you in and wrap you up in its moments--both the painful ones and the redemptive ones. It does all that we could ask of a film: it entertains us as it reveals to us what being human really means.",1202860800,,904,4.608695652173913

3142674,3,B001589S0E,"This well-made film based on the eponymous novel by W. Somerset Maugham was co-produced by its two stars, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who obviously were deeply committed to their roles and to the film.  The story is set in 1925.  Norton plays Dr. Walter Fane, a bacteriologist who falls in love with Kitty, played by Watts, an upper-middle-class Englishwoman whose parents are pressuring her to marry as she is getting older.  Although Kitty is not remotely in love with Fane, she agrees to marry him to get away from her mother's nagging, and follows him to Shanghai, where he works in a government laboratory.  Fane, at the beginning of the film, is a somewhat stolid, repressed figure (he insists on turning out the light when they make love) whose passions, until he meets Kitty, have all been focused on his work.  Their marriage more or less stumbles forward, with neither finding the emotional honesty or courage to try to initiate change.  Then Kitty meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a bon vivant, married man-about-town in Shanghai.  Townsend seduces Kitty, and they begin an affair that Dr. Fane discovers.  Fane confronts his wife, and offers her a choice: a disgraceful divorce, with Townsend named as the guilty co-respondent, or Kitty can follow him to a cholera-ridden village in-country, where, as a bacteriologist and a doctor, he will try to bring the epidemic under control.  When Kitty realizes that even with a divorce, Townsend will never leave his wife and marry her, she agrees to follow her husband into the epidemic - much to his satisfaction, as he intends the hardships of the journey and life in-country to punish her.  However, in the weeks that follow, amid heat, humidity, privation, and death, the couple begin to see each other in a different light, through their mutual experiences amid the stricken village: his at the hospital and hers at the orphanage attached to the hospital.  Confronted with horrific realities, the couple's boundaries begin to break down and they begin to communicate more honestly.

The performances are fine, with Norton, particularly, doing his usual understated and unselfish work, Watts believable as the initially petulant Kitty (although not so believable as a borderline ""old-maid""), and Schreiber suitably shallow as the suave seducer.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The film has some very affecting moments.

Yet something about the film is less than the sum of its parts, and the fault lies in the script.  Issues are left hanging and neither explored nor revealed through character development.  Fane is already in love with Kitty as the film opens, yet she does not even know his name.  No history is given - he and she appear, he is a stranger to her, yet he is already in love with her.  The initial stages of their courtship are hurried through, and therefore provide no foundation for their later choices - for example, why Fane refuses to inoculate himself against cholera when they reach the epidemic.  The mutual spiteful ""suicide pact"" that one is asked to accept without that foundation simply doesn't hold up.

The film, thus, has a ""paint by numbers"" quality that allows the viewer to guess the next turns of the plot with unerring accuracy, even if they have not read Maugham's novel.  The film does not so much unfold as ""unwrap"", with all the compartments already clearly labeled as they come out of the box.  One knows, for example, before it happens, that Townsend has no intention of  marrying Kitty.  The viewer can see it coming as Fane offers to divorce Kitty by taking the blame himself, as a ""gentleman"" used to do such circumstances, only if Townsend promises to leave his wife and marry Kitty afterward.  Kitty is the only one shocked at the revelation that Townsend has merely been amusing himself - the viewer has known it all along, and a sense of impatience sets in as we wait for the ""real"" part of the story to begin.

And this quality has deprived the movie, despite its many other assets, of the tension that is a prerequisite for a memorable film.

""The Painted Veil"" is certainly worth seeing once, especially for the earnest and sincere performances of the cast.  But its predictability is unfortunate, as otherwise this might have been one of those romantic films that one returns to again and again.",1200614400,,4323,4.899725274725275
3142675,4,B001589S0E,"There are some very insightful customer reviews on these pages.  The compelling ones for me are from those who have read and remembered Somerset Maugham's book and can compare it to the movie.  For example, I noted with interest the review which points out that the riots and allusions to a pending Communist threat are cinematic artifice and play no role at all in the book.  Typical.

This was a vanity project of sorts for Yale Chinese History major Edward Norton and his co-star, Naomi Watts.  They co-produced the film, which is the third iteration of Maugham's work to make it to the screen.  The two are dour, serious presences here.  And why not?  Their trip to the cholera-infested regions of China amounts to the equivalent (expressed well in another review) of a joint suicide pact...though Watts' character can hardly be called a willing partner at mission outset.

The real stars here are Director John Curran and Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh.  Filmed on location in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangxi, the landscapes and grandeur are breathtaking.",1198972800,,1059,5.0344827586206895
3142676,5,B001589S0E,"The film based on Somerset Maugham's THE PAINTED VEIL earns my high recommendation. The acting is fantastic - Edward Norton delivers a winning performance as Walter Fane (When's this guy going to win an Oscar?) and Naomi Watts embodies a brilliant Kitty Fane. Liev Schreiber stars as Charlie Townsend.

China, 1920s. A cholera epidemic plagues the Chinese countryside while at the same time the government is in political upheaval with the Nationalists vying for power. Bacteriologist Walter Fane and his pretentious, shallow wife Kitty decide to travel into the deep interior to help doctor a small town ravaged by the sickness. Their journey is made all the more complex because of her loveless espousal to Walter and her illicit affair with career politician Charlie Townsend. Of course Walter says that he's going to help the sick town, but his real motive is to remove his wife far away from her paramour and punish her in the process.

Seldom do I see a film that portrays a love story with this level of complexity. Married and loveless, Walter and Kitty have to travel an incredible distance between themselves if they ever hope to find love in their relationship. The journey is flawless and deep. Add to their journey the exotic setting of the Chinese countryside, the political unrest between Communism and freedom, the music and dancing intrinsic to Kitty's shallow soul, the battle against a ravaging disease, the overarching themes of religious truth and the brainwashing philanthropy of the Catholic nuns, and the discovery of new life and grace amid the bleakest of circumstances, and you've got a story that transcends the mundane and moves the heart. While arguably slow in parts, the tension of Walter and Kitty's relationship is masterful and a joy to watch in the hands of two accomplished actors.

In this story, however, the veil is indeed lifted as a man and a woman discover true life and true love by giving their lives for others. A dull civil servant, Dr. Fane, brilliantly played by Edward Norton and a shallow, silly debutante called Kitty (Naomi Watts) make a disastrous marriage of convenience. Only by going to a remote area of China to assist some helpless villagers in a cholera epidemic do the couple find themselves and each other. Dr. Fane is revealed to be man of courage and ingenuity; Kitty, with the help of some feisty nuns, learns to put the needs of others first. Her inner depths are unveiled as she discovers the reality of love. Diana Rigg portrays the Mother Superior who describes her own spiritual journey to Kitty. It is one of the best descriptions of the dark night of the soul that I have ever heard in a contemporary film.

Naomi Watts and Liev Schrieber are excellent but can't keep the film alive when Norton's in the frame.

Adapted from Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel and starring Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and a bravely makeup-eschewing Diana Rigg, The Painted Veil tells us of Walter Fane, a young doctor (so many of Maugham's characters were doctors) who falls in love with Kitty Garstin, a beautiful woman from a moneyed family, who impulsively weds the doctor in order to both escape and punish her callous mother. Soon finding herself re-located along with her husband to Shanghai, Kitty is stranded on the far side of the world amid unfamiliar people and places, married to a man she does not love and with whom she has virtually nothing in common. In the wake of his wife's eventual affair with a caddish playboy, Dr. Fane forces Kitty to move with him once more, this time into the primitive countryside of the Chinese interior, where a cholera epidemic is taking human life in appalling numbers long unseen back in Europe. Where once he had been filled with passionate love for Kitty, Walter now hates himself for ever loving her, and treats Kitty with punitive coldness and disdain. Isolated, facing horrors nothing in either of their pasts has prepared them for, the couple enter an existence which tries the human spirit, and recreates each of them into something greater than either could once ever have been. Maugham's story of romantic love, betrayal, redemption and higher love is magnificently unfolded here in one of the more worthwhile novel-to-screen productions of the decade. The Painted Veil is a twenty-first-century masterpiece.",1193702400,,1607,5.090909090909091

Although I think they are very talented, In THIS particular movie they were just not endearing AS A COUPLE in a love story should be.
There was little character development in both of these characters, and THAT made me care very little about what happened to either of them.

Rather than go through a scandalous divorce with her husband (Norton)over her affair, He blackmails her to move to China with him in the middle of a ""chlorea"" epidemic that is killing off people by the hundreds. He resents her so badly that it makes one wonder why he would want her with him at all. This storyline just did not make any sense to me.

Still though... there was a lot of things I LOVED about the movie. The cinematography was awesome, just beautiful ! - and the scenery was gorgeous too,China in all of it's beauty. The beautiful mountains in the early morning sunshine and fog. The rolling hills, and ancient architecture was extremely well shot.

Well, one more thing to be said in its favor...Watts and Norton are well-cast, according to their characters in the book.  However, the story is not faithful to the book...far from it.

The book is a wonderfully multi-dimensional tale of lust, disappointment, and above all, a woman's spiritual awakening.  The film touched only superficially on the first two, totally leaving the third out.

The title of the book ""The Painted Veil"" is supposed to point to Kitty's growing understanding that a spiritual world lives beyond the superficial ""veil"" of this one.  Her experience with the nuns and the wrenching experience of her affair and subsequent rejection by her husband leads to her spiritual awakening.  None of that in the film.

Rather, the film depicts a rather cliched story of a woman who marries out of necessity, has an affair, then falls in love with her husband and she with him.  Blech.  How boring.

Read the book.  It's so much better than the superficial story in the film.

It is a story of a rich spoiled woman, who marries a man she does not love to escape the fate of ""an old maid"" and her mother's sharp tongue.

3142694,4,B001589S0E,"2006' ""The Painted Veil"" has so much going for it, it should have been another ""English Patient"" -- a retro romance that sweeps awards and captures hearts.

Instead we have that most frustrating creature -- a very, very good movie that just misses the mark of greatness.

Even so - if you like period romances, you may love what is lovable in this movie enough to forgive it its flaws.

What ""The Painted Veil"" has going for it:

1.) The plot of the Somerset Maughm novel. A nerdy, scientific, cuckolded husband, who knows his beautiful, shallow, society wife married him because she was dangerously close to being an old maid and wanted to get away from her mother, punishes her for an affair by taking her to a remote Chinese cholera epidemic. Yawza! How operatic!

2.) Sky-high production values. ""The Painted Veil"" was filmed on location in China. Locations were mixed and matched. At one point they were along the Li River, among Guilin's famous karst scenery. Karst is the ""lumpy"" looking limestone topography. Towers rise abruptly, and weirdly,  out of river valleys, fringed by lush rice paddies and bamboo. The village Huang Yao is a five-hundred years old, intact Ming Dynasty town.

3.) Edward Norton is perfection. He gives Walter everything he needs -- as the nerdy, scientist cuckold husband, Walter is, by turns, arrogant, insecure, vengeful, loving, sweet, icy cold, naive, calculating ... you see it all on his face, and fear him, feel for him, and forgive him.

4.) Alexandre Desplat's award-winning score. Minimalist, and yet it conveys the plot's sense of entrapped passions and spiritual dimensions. Very good use is made of Eric Satie's Gnossienne # 1 and ""A La Claire Fontaine,"" a French folksong whose bittersweet lyrics, which can be found on the web, are so appropriate to the plot that they are heartbreaking.

5.) Diminutive blond Toby Jones' depiction of Waddington, a British provincial officer who is just barely keeping up appearances, in his day old stubble, shabby, sweat-stained suits, and live-in Chinese lover, young enough to be his daughter. Jones pumps this small role full of life. In another actor's hands Waddington would have been forgetable; with Jones, he's one of the most interesting features of the movie.

6.) The Love / Sex / Death / Religion / Self-Sacrifice nexus that modern pop culture doesn't even seem to realize exists; any work of art that reminds us that what we love is mortal and that God and Sex live next door to each other in our brains / souls / lives is way ahead of the pack.

7.) A scene from a Chinese opera. A vermilion and turquoise costume. Lin Zheng's brilliant performance.

8.) Anthony Wong as Colonel Yu. Again, a minor part, but Wong is riveting.

What I wish had been different:

1.) Liev Schreiber has an unmistakable earnestness that just doesn't work for him to be believable as a rake, cad, and bounder. He was much better as the earnest, befuddled cuckold in ""Walk on the Moon.""

2.) Naomi Watts. She's very pretty and very sweet and I just never, ever believed her as a shallow, devastatingly beautiful socialite who could drive two men to irresponsible action.

I kept thinking of Greta Garbo in the original ""Painted Veil,"" or Vivien Leigh as that insufferable monster, Scarlett -- as much as you hate her, you are fascinated. Not so with Watts.

3.) John Curran's direction. This is a MELODRAMA, John. Walter says, ""I despise myself for loving you."" Kitty says, ""If a man doesn't have what it takes to make a woman love him, that's his fault."" I mean, how can you direct that so anemically? As if they are asking for change to buy cheez crackers from the vending machine? In melodrama, you have to turn up the heat, send a few lightening bolts across the screen.

4.) The ending. I didn't need a happy or a sad ending. I just needed an ending that would serve the plot, and feel less like a dead end, a flat tire, that drained, rather than contributed, meaning to what has come before.",1189209600,,3973,4.7416545718432515

It ends with brilliant simplicity, leaving your mind and heart still entrapped in the story -- it's the kind of film you'll still be thinking about 2 days later while sipping a cup of tea.  Curran creates magic with his sweeping scenery, efortlessly emphasizing the isolation and loneliness Walter and Kitty are facing - both physically and emotionally.  Edward Norton truly becomes Walter, somehow managing to make clear Walter's growth through the film without losing the simple, quiet character he is.  Norton deserves every one of the awards he won for this movie and many more.  Naomi Watts is given the somewhat easier task of presenting Kitty, whose transformation is more active.  She too brings her screen persona to life beautifully -- moving from selfish young woman to shattered soul to simple strength without emotional manipulation or losing the essence of the story.  The two together bring a chemistry that touches the audience at the core of our being - and does so with a degree of subtlety that is rare today.

With that recipe it is no surprise that for those of us looking for a true experience film, Painted Veil is a hit.

It's a story of a couple who married despite one not loving the other but learning to as time goes by.

It has a tension running through it for the first three-quarters of the film, that makes you want to keep watching and find out what happens.

It doesn't hurt that it's beautifully filmed and that always-entertaining Edward Norton plays the male lead, Kitty's husband ""Walter.""

Things got much more interesting once they travelled inland; the photography is exquisite, and attention to detail is right-on. Norton and, especially, Watts are very fine, and it's always great to see Diana Rigg, even so briefly. The plot is simple enough (I won't give it all away as everyone else did), and the proceedings are handled well, though it moved too slowly for me. This period in Chinese history holds no end of intrigue, and being caught in a cholera epidemic with the Chinese Nationals approaching created a bit of angst. There is a smattering of redemption, and the suggested feminist twist at the end was a fine addition. Check it out, but be sure there are no distractions.",1188604800,,835,4.687074829931973

3142704,5,B001589S0E,"Read the ""Is it possible to fall in love with virtue?"" review. It does great justice to this beautiful film.

This was a challenging movie, a very unusual love story, where two unhappy people who initially lack a shared connection or chemistry, grow to respect one another, and from this respect springs passion. Not the usual pattern of events- and a challenge to communicate convincingly. Very few actors could have portrayed this relationship so seamlessly. Watts and Norton delivered exceptionally mature performances - they really should be credited as brilliant for pulling this off.  So subtle too, not a bit over the top; their clean, quiet performances were nearly flawless.

Another essential ingredient to this movie, aside from the the historical setting (the Orient during a cholera epidemic) is the musical score. It does so much to set the tone of this film, and it is as perfect as Watts and Norton's acting.

This movie's beauty makes one weep. I wish I could do it justice with words, but I can not. Just don't miss the chance to see it.",1187136000,,1055,4.844444444444444
3142705,5,B001589S0E,"One of the first things you'll notice about `The Painted Veil' is it's crisp beauty and elegance.  It's effortlessly filmed with such expansive grandeur it's impossible not to become enthralled in its scenery, both human and atmospheric.  The next thing you're sure to realize is that young Naomi Watts is sure to be one of our finest working actresses, for with every subtle movement of her facial features, her graceful fingertips or any other part of her beautifully constructed body she gives off the essence of brilliance, portraying the exact emotion we need to understand and cultivating in herself and in her audience a trust within this woman that begs to be established.  She effortlessly moves in and out of her emotions with such skill it's astonishing to me she was utterly ignored throughout awards season.

There is so much more to love and appreciate within this fabulous film, but it rests on the shoulders of the beautiful backdrop and the even more beautiful Watts to carry us to a place we would otherwise never venture.

The film, which is based on the novel written by W. Somerset Maugham, centers around the marriage and relationship between Walter and Kitty Fane.  Walter is a very shy bacteriologist who pursues Kitty's hand despite the fact that Kitty herself is not fairly interested.  Peer pressure from her family and that aching feeling of failure push Kitty into a marriage she is not invested in and soon her longing for real love leads her into adultery with married Charlie.  After uncovering her tryst Walter gives Kitty some options.  Walter has volunteered to help a small town ravaged by a severe cholera epidemic.  Kitty must either come with him or he will publicly divorce her.  Her only suitable (by her terms) way out would be to have Charlie agree to divorce his wife and marry her.  He of course declines the idea and Kitty is forced to accompany Walter.

Upon their arrival Kitty is appalled with their new living conditions, frightened even, and the growing distance between Walter and herself is making the transition all the more difficult.  `The Painted Veil' ultimately is about growth and understanding and the power of love overcoming all.  Kitty married a man for whom she had no love for, a man whom she really didn't even know and understand, but watching him in his element, helping all these people, fighting for their health and survival helped Kitty to realize that she respected him and ultimately she falls in love with him.  He helps her become a better person and likewise she helps him become a more desirable person.  `The Painted Veil' succeeds beautifully in creating a love story for the ages.

Aside from the magnificent `Oscar Worthy' Watts there are quite a few very strong performances within this film.  Edward Norton, who co-produced this film, turns out yet another powerful performance as Walter.  Norton is one of my favorite actors for he always invests himself so deeply in his performances.  He had a very strong year in 2006 with `The Painted Veil' following `The Illusionist' and `Down in the Valley', each performance just as strong as the next.  Here he beautifully captures the heart of this man, broken and depressed realizing the woman he loves has disregarded him, and the barriers he builds for himself to protect the dignity he has left is nothing short of wholeheartedly believable and relatable.  Toby Jones, better known as `the other Capote' turns in a key performance as the Fane's neighbor, and Diana Rigg is just superb as the runner of the orphanage where Kitty finds her redemption.

Aside from Watts though I feel the star of this film is none other than director John Curran who infuses so much life and atmosphere into this film that the audience is drawn in from the very beginning.  He captures so brilliantly the time and era, his surroundings but most importantly the emotions of his characters.  `The Painted Veil' truly is a near perfect film, one that is sure to find a place in your heart and make an impact on your very soul.",1186963200,,4037,4.822931785195936

I TOOK A CHANCE AND ORDERED THE DVD, MAINLY BECAUSE DIANA RIGG WAS IN THE CAST.

I AM CERTAIN THAT MR. MAUGHAM WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIBLY DISPLEASED IN THE WAY HIS BOOK WAS BUTCHERED.

I GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY WHICH WAS MANIFICENT.

I WAS STRUCK WITH THE RIOTING CHINESE DEPICTED, WHICH IN FACT WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE BOOK AT ALL.

TO BE BRIEF, THE ENDING OF THE DVD GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY RAN OUT OF FILM AND HAD NO CONNECTION TO THE BOOK AT ALL. THE SCENE WHERE KITTY IS WALKING DOWN A LONDON STREET WITH HER YOUNG CHILD (A BOY) AND IS
APPROACHED BY CHARLIE, HER PAST LOVER WHO LOOKS AT THE YOUNG BOY IMPLYING THAT HE THINKS IT  HIS CHILD AND THE SHORT INTERECHANGE BETWEEN THEM AS KITTY FADES AWAY IN THE LONDON STREET WITH HER CHILD WAS ABSOLUTELY RUBBISH AND IN NO WAY WAS CONNECTED TO THE BOOK.

AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I ORDERED THE BOOK AND RE-READ IT AND FOUND IT FASCINATING WITH MANY PASSAGES THAT WERE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAT I FIND STILL UNFORGETTABLE.

TO SUMMRIZE:  IF YOU NEVER READ THE BOOK NOR INTEND TO, THEN THIS DVD COULD POSSSIBLY BE FOR YOU, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LITTLE BEARING WITH BOOK.
HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK AND HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED AS I HAVE, THEN I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD AT ALL.  SADLY, DIANA RIGG'S CHARACTER AS THE MOTHER SUPERIOR COULD HAVE BEEN ENRICHED IF GIVEN MORE EXPOSURE.

3142710,4,B001589S0E,Good Movie.  A well filmed and beautiful movie with beautiful scenery and believable characters.

3142711,4,B001589S0E,"I watched the movie not for Naomi Watts or Edward Norton but because it is based on the original work of Somerset Maugham. I am a big fan of Somerset Maugham and have read with delight his two classics -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Human-Bondage/dp/0735101213/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Human Bondage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Painted-Veil/dp/0307277771/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Painted Veil</a>. This movie tries to capture that spirit of the book and I thought Edward Norton did a fine work. He was able to convey the simmering, unexpressed anger within him and the overt anger sometime emerging out of him, as the culmination of a buildup of grievances with the protagonist Kitty Fane( Naomi Watts). I liked Naomi Watts also, particularly her role during the later part of the movie when she realizes what and who truly matters in the life.
The movie also depicts the old time China beautifully and the sad reminder of the killer diseases like cholera. Expect mixed emotions as you watch this movie, it's not exactly a family movie, so watch when you feel like  reflecting on your own life, counting your blessings etc...you get the idea..

3142712,5,B001589S0E,"It's very unusual, these days, to see a husband and wife, seemingly ""mismatched,"" grow through marriage into a true and deep love for one another.  Kitty is self-absorbed and pleasure-seeking, Walter is serious, oriented toward research and service.  Bound to fail, right?  Eharmony would never pair these two...and some marriage counselors would say, ""Forget it.""

Others have described the plot very well, I won't repeat it here.  It's easy to downgrade Kitty, she marries for all the wrong reasons...but she's right that virtuous guys can sometimes be boring.  Edward Norton does a fantastic job of portraying the intellectual loner who is originally spellbound by Kitty...so spellbound that he doesn't really relate to her as she is...she is almost an object of worship to him.  Naturally this fails to awaken her passion.  Not that I am meaning to excuse her, just to say that there is room for growth in BOTH people in this movie.  When he is cuckolded, Walter reacts by retreating into rigid rectitude...but we always know that he still loves Kitty, even though he is terribly hurt and cannot believe that she will ever change.  When they begin to open up to each other again, Walter is transformed as well, moving beyond his initial one-dimensional view of Kitty to accept her as a person that he can respect, even though she is still the lighthearted musician who plays for the orphans to dance.  He is more of a man, and she has grown into womanhood by falling in love with his virtue...not just any virtue, but HIS.

It's a fine movie.  Not slow, unless you have no taste for nuance and beauty.  Waddington and his Chinese girlfriend are a sort of Mozartian parallel couple (Papageno/Papagena) to Walter and Kitty (Tamino/Pamina).  It is clear from the brief focus on the girlfriend that she truly loves Waddington. Kitty's realization of this is a turning point, and this scene is masterfully acted by all.

On top of all that, the music, from French folk song to Satie, is used with perfect appropriateness to the action.  The ending is realistic and perfectly satisfying, even though not ""happy"" in the traditional sense.  5 stars, you bet!",1184976000,,2154,4.887052341597796
3142713,5,B001589S0E,"The tag line was what intriqued me ""Sometimes the greatest journey is the distance between two people"". After I finished this movie, I knew that I had to read the book. I found that I enjoyed the movie more than the book because the movie portrayed more of Kitty's realization of love for her husband. It's a love situation that happens more often than we thought. A woman has a good man, but thinks that another man has something that her man doesn't, only to realize in the end that her man is the better man after all. Sadly, to Kitty, the realization came too late.

I don't know why I love this movie so much despite its gory details. I usually don't like movies with disturbing images but I love this movie despite of it. It's a brilliant piece of art. Edward Norton is marvellous in it, he portrays Dr. Fane well as a man whom one would pity him at first, understand him later, and love him in the end. Naomi Watts is perfect for her role. Her luminous skin, which is an emphasized point in the book, is one of her best assets shown in this movie.

This is the only movie that I've seen that is better than the book itself (well, actually.. also the Sound of Music). I wish Edward Norton would consider making the movie out of the book Pavilion of Women by Pearl S. Buck, which is one of my favorite books.",1184889600,,1313,4.269076305220883

3142715,3,B001589S0E,"Previous reviewers pointed out many positive aspects of this very well made movie ""The Painted Veil.""  I have no negative comment regarding Edward Norton's or Naomi Watt's acting skills.  This film meets the stardard quality of ""Hollywood"" production that one would expect nowadays.  However, as a movie afficionado and a movie critique, I can not help but feel some disappoint at the overall quality of the movie.
The movie begins with very appealling and stunning scenaries of China.  The beginning reminded me of other great romantic dramas that take place in adventurous places, like ""Cold Mountain"" or ""Legends of Fall.""  But, from that point on, the whole story takes a wrong turn and declines precipitously.
The biggest problem with this movie is its screenplay.  It is supposed to be based on W. Somerset Maugham's novel.  Because I haven't read the novel, I cannot comment on how well this movie adopts the original novel, but at the end of the movie, I felt that a great opportunity was lost because of many weaknesses in the storyline.  As many people probably know, W. Somerset Maugham wrote ""The Moon and Six Pence"" and other novels.  Maugham had a recurring theme of Victorian English man's disallusionment with the post-industrial, Capitalism, and overly idealized fantasy with Oriental, tribal women.  Maugham particularly dwelled on Victorian English male's sexual fantasy, sexual encounters with sexually liberated tribal women in his novels.  In the movie, the screenplay tries to keep up that literary theme from Maugham's novels.  IN this movie, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton appear as a newly wed couple, who do not know each other well, and embarks upon this un-predicted journey into the deep, heart-land of China.  This beginning gives a great setting for an amazing tale of love, sacrifice, and romance.  The story pretty much ends at that point.  New characters, such as Mr. Waddington or his ""oriental"" sex-slave, greatly damage the existing main relationship between the two main characters.  There are too many un-necessary story developments that detract from the tension between Mr and Mrs. Fane (Norton and Watts).  IN the end, the story becomes too monotonous and insipid.  It was a great disappointment to me, because the beginning of the movie had such a great promise of strong and memorable story, but it ends up being just an adaptation of a poorly written novel.
I suppose I can give five stars for the production, visual presentation, music, etc.  But, I believe that the screenplay writers could've done a much better job to develop a memorable, enduring romance between Mr. and Mrs. Fane (main characters).",1184371200,,2649,5.104408352668213

Naomi Watts and Ed Norton both turn in powerful, Oscar-worthy performances and are mesmerizing together. The story line is subtle and unfolds layer by layer while drawing the viewer in. The Painted Veil is a story of morality, love, and redemption and though sad, it make one feel uplifted to watch the struggle, transformation and ultimate triumph of two souls.

I worried though that I wouldn't get into the story at all. Love stories to me can be very good or very weak. The Painted Veil, nonetheless, I find a success. Not only does it have beautiful scenes as promised, but the writing and the actors themselves were quite strong. Norton especially made one memorable and definitely likeable character.

From beginning to end I was kept in interest of this story and yes did have a part of me hoping this marriage on the rocks would turn into a finally passionate romance. The ending is terribly sad though. I wasn't expecting it and didn't really want it to end that way- nonetheless, it was realistic so I really won't complain. Just sorry that it happened.

Overall I highly recommend The Painted Veil. It turned out to be much more than I expected it would be.

Basic Plot:  Young and plain in social standing but endowed with beauty, Kitty marries Dr. Walter, a shy and reserved bacteriologist who adores Kitty but does not have the personality to show it.  Driven by boredom and a loveless marriage - loveless on Kitty's part - she commits adultery with a charming diplomat.  With the discovery of his wife's adultery Dr. Walter takes his unwilling wife to the central part of the deadly cholera epidemic.  And there the love story begins.

This movie is one of the few recent movies that I saw that did not disappoint my expectations.  I believe that a `true' love story - love stories that are not only trying to be cute but really portray the love that we experience in real life - should reflect realities honestly and accurately.  And this I believe cannot be accomplished merely by good acting and directing but with the right team.  Norton and Watts was such a team.
The choice of the backdrop of this love story could not have been more odd - a cholera infested China town.  But their love was like a rose in the middle of a plant-less, muddy swamp.  Because the movie paints such a picture, the love story seems even more beautiful.  But that is not all.  Although this is a love story, the story honors the scare of the cholera outbreak and the ghostly atmosphere of the town.  This authentic scenery is disturbing but elevates the level of the movie.

The is a beautifully poised and presented film. It will indulge you by gently transporting you to a world of chaotic change. You'll get a glimpse of the fear, misery and helplessness of rural peasants during a cholera outbreak.

Ed Norton plays Dr Thane, who's emotions have recklessley taken him and his wife, played by Naomi Watts, into the seat of the epidemic, ostensibly to help battle the contagion. His subtext is a deathwish for either him or his wife.

The film gently ebbs and twists through its plot, and so greatly emphasises the acting.
Watts delivers a moving and sensitive performance  which is gripping. The enigmatic Norton lends this quality to Doctor Thane, and in doing so, leaves us with a slightly hollow character.

Ed Norton appears to have acting talents that are yet to mature. In this portrayal, his naturally and intensley sunny charm with his captivating boyish smile, undoes his fine portrayal of Dr Thane. The character doesn't quite make sense and therefore undermines the story. He can be a great actor, but he needs to put away the boy and the smile and give his talents their full reign.

Diana Rigg gives a magnificent and imperious performance as Mother Superior of the orphanage. She positively crackles with power and haughty, sinister beneficence.

Also notable is Toby Jones, who plays Waddington, a British nabob gone native. Jones injects a solidity into this character which greatly help move the story along.

With such a talented cast, with a real and rich story, you'd be forgiven for expecting more from this film.

3142730,4,B001589S0E,"Quite enjoyable.  The scenery is striking--especially those exotic Chinese mountains--and the acting is supurb. The central and most interesting aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the evolution and development of the character Kitty (Naomi Watts).

Kitty, a spoiled and selfish rich girl, marries the socially awkward research physician, Dr. Walter Fane (Norton) just to spite her meddlesome parents.  She has little regard for the good doctor, even though he is madly in love with her, and she spites him by having an affair with the philandering Charlie Townsend.  Dr. Fane turns out to be not as niave and timorous as she believes, and when he sternly confronts her, she chooses to follow him into the cholera-ridden interior of China rather than face an ignominious divorce.  While there, she must endure boredom and the flinty indifference of her spouse, until she finds meaning and purpose serving in the village orphanage.  In the process of time, she learns to appreciate her husband, and develops a true and selfless emotional bond with him.  In the end, we see a mature, self-possessed young women, having both self-respect as well as devotion to family.

The music is also lovely.  Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang and composer Alexandre Desplat team up for some subtle yet memorable melodies.  But I must say that the children's choir singing the French song (A La Claire Fontaine)at the very end of the movie is piercingly gorgeous.",1182297600,,1449,5.050420168067227

3142732,5,B001589S0E,"Produced by it's two stars, Watts & Norton, this film takes the viewer to a time & place ripe with beauty and fraught with danger.  Like all remarkable stories, The Painted Veil takes the viewer on a journey; not just from 1920's London to Shanghai and deep into the Chinese interior, but through the human heart.  Through Kitty and Walter Frane, whose relationship will prove as challenging as the cholera epidemic decimating the countryside, we discover the depth and capacity that exist within the human being for change, forgiveness and love.

The cinematography is so evoctive that one feels the oppressive humidity of the season on the Chinese plains and hillsides.

Ms. Watts classic features and clipped precise Britishness, work perfectly for the thoughtless and vapid Kitty in the early days of the film.  It is only deep into the film, that one senses the true gifts of Ms. Watts as an actor, as with one look or movement she conveys the pain and courage of a woman discovering her true self.

His boyish good looks might have hindered believability in playing a man of such complex and contradictory nature, but fortunately, Edward Norton is more than matinee idol good-looks.  Norton is a brilliant and instinctual performer who slips chameleon-like into each new role.  His Walter is the man each and every audience member can understand, because we've each and everyone experienced great joy, great anger, the urge for revenge and ultimately the need to forgive and begin again.  Norton's movements and indeed his vocal range are small to non-existant throughout much of the film.  So much so, that when he does indeed make the grand gesture its affects are deeply felt.  It is not often one can refer to a studied performance without sounding as if the performer relied on acting techniques , but there is a strong sense of intelligence, without the loss of real emotion in each of Mr. Norton's performances and the Painted Veil is no exception.

Liev Schreiber, as the caddish married lover of Naomi Watts' Kitty Frane, reminded me of William Powell or Errol Flynn.  Mr. Schreiber adds his own special touch of class to an already stylish little film gem.

Just a beautiful film to be relished.",1182297600,,2211,4.877005347593583

As reviewing the film alone, I doubt that nobody will quibble with the fact that this  is a beautifully filmed piece of work that had an equally compelling soundtrack. I found the colour and the editing to be exquisite, in fact.

I personally felt that the pacing of the film was the biggest problem. In fact, it dragged severely in my opinion. No matter how compelling a story or how good the actors, if the pace is slow then the film
 simply has no energy and suffers from jet lag. I personally admire the work of Edward Norton, but this film simply left me flat. That it received  nominations did not surprise me at all. That it won none did not surprise me either.",1182211200,,836,4.339743589743589
3142734,4,B001589S0E,"In this 2007 film adaptation of the Somerset Maughn novel, lead actors Edward Norton and Naomi Watts render subtle and praiseworthy performances that brings this classic story of an adulterous wife's voyage of self-discovery during the cholera epidemic in 1920's China to a grand panoramic celluloid life akin to the scenic beauty depicted in ""Out of Africa"" complimented with a soaring soundtrack by Alexandre Michel Desplat.  Alluding to the first line of the sonnet by Percy Blythe Shelley:

 ""Lift not the painted veil which those who live
Call Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,
And it but mimic all we would believe
With colours idly spread behind, lurk Fear
And Hope, twin Destinies; who ever weave
Their shadows, o'er the chasm, sightless and drear,""

the film's characters waltz around this theme of perceived images and identities.  Dr. Walter Fane is blinded by his wife's selfishness while Kitty sees her husband only as a functionary intent on his duty.  Only when the two ""lift"" the painted veil of these iconic public personas do they actually see within and glimpse at each other's spirits.

For me, any film featuring Edward Norton is worth watching.  As Dr. Walter Fane in this adaptation of the Somerset Maughn novel, ""The Painted Veil,"" again, this superb actor does not disappoint.

Some reviewers claim that Norton's performance seems wooden and two-dimensional.  I disagree.  Norton's boyish good looks add to his vulnerability as a husband who has discovered his wife's indiscretion.  The seemingly cardboard sternness he projects shimmers with nuanced frustration, anger and pride; he cannot look at his wife for fear that with one glance she will glimpse the soft underbelly he has hidden beneath his outraged austerity.

Similarly, Naomi Watts equally outdoes herself as Kitty, the wayward wife.  With her brunette marcel-styled hair - I have to wonder at this choice of looks for this character---she epitomizes the selfish, emotionally immature woman that wins and breaks Norton's heart.  Kitty's ultimate epiphany occurs gradually.  Watt's perfect porcelain complexion glows like a waxing moon as she untangles herself from her own preoccupation and see the man she married as truly noble and more than worthy of lifetime devotion.

The film's one fault may be that once its climatic scene plays out, the ending follows far too quickly, forcing the audience to digest Kitty's reawakened self-awareness in a drive-thru timeframe rather than in the deliberate haute cuisine mode it deserves.

Bottom line?  ""The Painted Veil"" offers much to an audience that favors the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" genre of entertainment.  A lush backdrop, notable performances and a classic story succeed in propelling the viewer back in time to the uncertain yet familiar territory explored by the human heart.  Recommended.

3142735,2,B001589S0E,"Good performances, strong cinematography and an exquisite soundtrack can all be found in this version of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, which is a good thing since only a phantom of his novel can be pinpointed.  Kitty's search for spiritual and personal development has been shoved to the side and replaced by her need to be loved. The enigmatic Walter Fane is here converted to a romantic hero and far more vocal/expressive than he was ever meant to be on the page. I just don't understand why the characters needed to be altered so dramatically in order to tell the tale, no matter how distorted.

Notable in many reviews of this film, was the fact many critics found the characters unlikeable. Well, yes, but they were also far more likeable and less transformative than how they were portrayed in the film.  Romantizing the plot to the degree where it became all about love and - to secure the Chinese seal of approval required to allow filming - distorting Walter's role in the containment of the cholera epidemic did nothing for the film except to pander needlessly for the Oscar nominations which it got, but not in any major categories.

Norton's portrayal of Walter Fane starts out well enough and true to Maugham's original novel, but as the affair is revealed, his character loses the one characteristic he is able to retain in the novel - his bloodlessness.  In the climatic confrontation in the novel, he tells Kitty,  ""I had no illusions about you. I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It's comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew.""

The 'veil' that was lifted had nothing to do with his perception of Kitty; the veil was the self-involved cluelessness that Kitty was entrenched in so deeply that she was lured towards the shallow vapidness of Charlie and in the process broke the heart of the one person who loved her despite her weaknesses and asked only that she be loyal to him. Walter wanted only what he had been able and willing to give Kitty - selfless loyalty and affection.

Maugham's stories are well-paced, studied and full of emotion. It's a shame that a true version of ""The Painted Veil"" will probably never be seen. Hollywood for the third time neglects the true journey - that of a woman to her own heart, motivation and life - in favor of yet another journey between two people.",1182124800,,2761,4.5636363636363635

She soon gets bored with Walter, and finds herself embroiled in a passionate affair with the married British Vice-Consul, Charles Townsend [Liev Shreiber]. The affair however is doomed because Charles is a lothario who enjoys his fun too much for lasting emotional attachments. Kitty finds herself being found out, and Walter exacts his revenge by compelling Kitty to accompany him to a remote village where cholera is rampant. The rest of the movie deals with the emotional complexities of two tormented souls who are brought together under harsh and unforgiving circumstances and learn to come to terms with each other. The two leads here are compelling and believable in their roles, and in fact though Watts and Shreiber are a real-life couple, what struck me more was the great chemistry between Watts and Norton. The cinematography is simply beautiful, evoking the lush Chinese rural landscape, and the score is equally haunting. There are also good supporting roles here - the Mother Superior [Diana Rigg], Shreiber and a few others all add to the emotional depth of this very human drama.

She's just married a stodgy doctor (Edward Norton) who has taken her away from her dilettantish life in London for the mind-numbing boredom of colonial Shanghai.  Kitty's problem is that she thinks love should be passionate and marriage should be a source of amusement.  Having lived a privileged life, she has no regard for the political turmoil taking place in China.  She also has no regard for her hard-working husband.  Instead, Kitty indulges in a wild affair with the British Vice Consul (Liev Schreiber).  Her husband is no fool, however.  He quickly catches onto the affair.  As such, he gives her an ultimatum.  She can either go with him to a cholera stricken village or he can sue her for divorce in a time where divorce is based on fault (e.g. allegations of adultery).  Kitty quickly realizes that her lover is all talk, and will never leave his wife for her.  She therefore makes the journey to remote Mei-tan-fu with her husband.  There, Kitty's eyes are opened to a world far beyond what she could ever imagine.  Too late, she realizes that she loves her husband.

This beautifully written, and produced movie, grabs you from the start. Gives insight to the day when marriages weren't all about love, sometimes, or at least don't start out that way, in this case.

It is a great journey, going from marrying without knowing each other, but having certain expectations from one another. Like behaviors, Walter is someone that is awkard with his affections, not comfortable with the lights on when making love. But Kitty wants passion, and is eager for someone to give that to her.

He does finally get to express his passion, as he and Kitty's relationship builds, as they start seeing each other for who they are, the realization  that they love the qualities in each other, as they discover one another's identities.

It is such a wonderful thing to visibly SEE the two of them, change the the way they SEE each other, to watch them fall in love.

All the parts were well played, and vital to the movie. I loved Waddington, and his part as a friend to the Fane's and love to his companion, who also played well.

The actor that played as Kitty's guard was really great, he was so natural.

The one that spoke with the warlord, was super, his part was very well written, very clever, and he was perfect, I loved his part. His whole role is very believable.

Kitty's lack of love for Walter hits him hard and he buries himself in his work once they arrive at the cholera-infected town. He transfers his love for his wife into his love for his work, caring for the sick and dying (especially the children) while riding recklessly through the disease-riddled area. He quickly encounters battles with the townsfolk who believe his coming there was a bad omen. Eastern superstition battles Western medicine and with the assistance of a communist soldier names Colonel Yu (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang), he forms a tenuous relationship between slowing the epidemic and helping maintain the Chinese culture.

Kitty soon learns that Walter is becoming more and more respected in the area, and she eventually volunteers to help care for the sick too (without Walter's knowledge, initially). Distant husband and lonely wife begin seeing each other during their treatment, and each learns much about the other. Walter finds that he can forgive his wife for her infidelity and for his own mismanagement of their marriage. Kitty grows up and learns that being the wife of a respectable doctor isn't such a bore after all. Love grows, but like a beautiful flower, it is often most fragrant and colorful right before it dies.

The ending sequence between Watts and Norton are what great film is all about. The lighting, the acting, the set, the crushing emotion, all play a pitch-perfect role.

You'd be hard-pressed to find another film so finely done in 2006. Bravo.",1179360000,,3992,5.921875

The Painted Veil stars Ed Norton as Walter Fand and Naomi Watts as Kitty Fand.  The story begins in 1920 England where Kitty is being pressured to find a husband by her mother and father.  After the dance they shared Walter Fane is convinced Kitty should become his wife.  They wed only a few days after meeting.

Walter Fane takes his new bride to Shanghai China where he works as a bacterilogist.  Kitty is bored in her new home and instead of being the socialite she is used to she is shuned in the social circles.  She finds little in common with her husband who is very dedicated to his work and not her.  She finds the love and acceptance she seeks in an affair with the British vice consul (Lieu Schreiber).

Walter discovers the affair and gives Kitty her options: divorce because of adultery or to follow him to fight a cholera out break.  She follows and the two learn to get pass the anger they feel toward each other.  Their lives become interwined as they learn to love each other.

3142759,4,B001589S0E,"THE PAINTED VEIL is based on a W. Somerset Maugham novel and a remake of a 1934 MGM romance starring Greta Garbo.  Exquisitely photographed all over China in Panavision by Stuart Dryburgh and with a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat, both of whom should have richly received Oscar nominations here, the new movie starts with an act of adultery in 1925 London.  Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts who also produced) cheats on doctor husband Walter (Edward Norton who was also a producer here) with married diplomat lover Charlie (Liev Schreiber).  In a simmering rage, Walter wants to divorce Kitty, but then has a more vicious revenge for her:  join him as they fight a cholera epidemic in a remote Chinese village.

The movie is long, slow, languid, with some of the most beautiful scenery and photography of at least the last decade in movies.  Kitty is a proud feminist, while Walter seems to hate his wife.  He ignores her, initially displays no love for her.  So Kitty goes off on her own to explore the cholera village.  She runs into Christian missionaries (one of whom is an unrecognizable, but excellent Diana Rigg).  Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are wondrous in these main roles, probably better than Garbo and Herbert Marshall in the 1934 original film.

But then Walter sees that Kitty is coming alive in helping the cholera victims; he comes out of his own shell in graphic hospital scenes as a doctor.  The two make love as husband and wife passionately, and Kitty gets pregnant.  But the father appears to be her married diplomat lover from reel one.  What happens next?  Rent the utterly beautiful and romantic THE PAINTED VEIL and see for yourself.  A box office dud that the studio (Warner Bros. and several production companies) threw away in theaters, the movie now has a chance to recoup its loses on home video.

3142762,5,B001589S0E,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I came to this film: a standard period drama perhaps. I'd heard mixed reviews, a lackluster trailer, and it was overlooked by the awards bodies in 2006, but I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the film and the performances in particular.

Nothing about this film is fast or surprising really. We know essentially who our characters are in the first 5 minutes, Walter meets Kitty at a party and asks her to dance. The next day he proposes and she accepts. We know he proposes because he is a rational, intelligent man, used to organization and reason. He falls in love with Kitty suddenly and without reason, but the only way he knows how to respond is to act on it. He's a doctor going to Shanghai to study a cholera epidemic and he loves her- the reasonable thing to do is to marry her and take her with him. She accepts his proposal to get as far away from her mother as humanly possible.  The pair are obviously mismatched. Kitty likes Walter well enough but she's a fun loving girl, slightly shallow, fond of gossip, games, dancing and theater. He's an intellectual who is socially awkward. It's not surprising that Kitty has a fling with another Englishman in Shanghai. Walter finds out and is naturally devistated. He offers Kitty a respectable, quiet divorce only if her lover agrees to marry her. He doesn't. As a sort of punishment for her adultery Walter volunteers to serve as a doctor for a small inland village ravaged by cholera. Kitty is to come with him. What is intended as a punishment turns out to be their salvation.

All we need to know about the nature of the characters is established in the first 45 minutes of the film. We're told little but shown everything. With a smile Kitty shows us she's not always genuine, she enjoys a party but has a two faced side to her. In handing a gift to Kitty, Walter shows us his awkwardness, his kindness, and his fear of the woman he loves. As soon as he says he's an epidemiologist we know he's passionate about is work. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton subtly convey every emotion of their characters by their tone of voice, the ways they stand in one anothers presence. Neither has a meldramatic scene or a grand declaration but they exhibit the heights of human emotions.

Ultimately the actions of other characters, and imperialism itself are viewed through the lens of each character. Kitty sees nuns taking care of the children in an orphanage and says how wonderful they are. Walter says, that yes, the children benefit but Kitty should also keep in mind that the nuns are not totally altrustic: they pay the families of children to give them their babies so they can raise them as Catholics. The children are cared for and protected but also denied their culture. The film itself presents these concerns but doesn't pass judgement. That is left up to the viewer.

Also particuilarly worthy of note are the settings, the stunning backgrounds of China's mountains and rivers. The lush greenery is shot with somewhat muted tones. Alexandre Desplat's score compliments the muted visuals of the film. It's subdued and evocative with occasional Asian influences sprinkled throughout.

The Painted Veil is one of those films where more than one aspect is well above average and that elevates the film as a while. This isn't a Merchant-Ivory film but it could pass for one: the beautiful visuals, excellent performances, amd strong score recall literary adaptations such as Howard's End or A Room With A View.",1179014400,,3517,4.701298701298701
3142763,2,B001589S0E,"I have no idea how these reviewers could give this more than an average 4 star rating. Where do we begin...hmmmm.  How about the missing chemistry between the actors--not just the missing sexual chemistry, as it is a story of a mismatch (and by the way, mismatches in real life never become more than that) but it is as if they are in completely different movies.

 Naomi Watts did not pull off the psych-sexual guilt-desire slave well, and then the rebuff renders her as flat as a pancake.  She's like a half-character wandering around looking for a personality to jump into.

I won't give away more than that, don't think this is a spoiler.  The other thing, perhaps Americans are very tolerant of bad English accents, but Norton's ""Brit"" was fake--it drove me nuts.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to be an American taking on a British accent, then do it like Meryl Streep or shut the hell up.

Further to the botched accent, Norton was oddly wooden...not in a stuck up high soceity sort of way either, but stiff, reflexive, rote.  Ordinarily, I expect great things of Edward Norton, who remains on my top 10 actor list, as soon as he comes to his senses, stops producing vanity projects and gets into some real meat--I'm used to depth from this young man.

In short, the entire film hangs on the performance of Watts and Norton, and both are in their own universes.  I would like to say more about the lousy screenplay but that would give the piece away.  Maugham is probably spinning in his grave, or digging deeper.  Both Norton and Watts are listed as producers... wow, how incredibly ironic that is.",1178928000,,1607,4.5964912280701755
3142764,4,B001589S0E,"Though some readers who are familiar with the novel, 'The Painted Veil', may have quibbles about the altered sequences and places of action and character emphasis in Ron Nyswaner's screenplay, those disparities pale in comparison to the superb acting and cinematic treatment of Maugham's story about the development of love in the most unlikely situation.  John Curran directs his superb cast with fluid movement, allowing the story to unfold in flashbacks in a manner suggestive of the longing and the nightmares of dreams.

Bacteriologist physician Dr. Kane (Edward Norton) is devoted to his work, and part of his work is to quickly marry so that he may proceed with his obsession with his career.  In London he is introduced to the reluctant Kitty (Naomi Watts), a lass who continues to look for the perfect love of her life, but is confronted with reality when her father demands she marry. Kitty is not attracted to Dr. Kane but agrees to marry him and soon they are off to China.  While in Shanghai (no, not Hong Kong) Kitty is bored until she meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) who, though married and a man of public image, sweeps Kitty off her feet.  Their affair is discovered by Dr. Kane and he insists that Kitty either follow him to a small village in interior China, a town besieged by cholera, or go public with a divorce.  Kitty turns to her lover Charlie who refuses to divorce his society wife and Kitty sadly follows her husband to the sick village.

Once settled in the village the couple is befriended by a fellow British gentleman Waddington (Toby Jones) and while Dr. Kane works devotedly with his patients and his epidemiological efforts to stem the cholera, Kitty finds refuge with a group of nuns who care for the children of the dead.  The Mother Superior (Diana Rigg) helps Kitty to adjust and to see the inherent good in her husband, a man who is not only a fine physician but also able to accept the fact that his once disconsolate wife is pregnant, probably as a result of her dalliance with Charlie Townsend.  As the couple begin to accept and appreciate each other the disease strikes home and the story ends with evidence of inner growth in everyone involved.

Norton, Watts, Jones, and Rigg are radiant in their understated roles - Norton's English accent is superb.  The beauty of the film is due in a large part to the beauty of the landscapes of China, but also in an equal part to the eloquent cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh and the musical score composed by Alexandre Desplat (with a nod to Satie) and played by pianist Lang Lang.  The film is as soft in appearance as a painted veil and the mood it creates lingers - even for those who prefer the written version! Grady Harp, May 07",1178755200,,2731,4.666666666666667

""The Painted Veil"" is old school, not just because it is based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel, but also because this 2006 movie has sensibilities more akin to the Hollywood of the 1930s (when the movie was first filmed with Greta Garbo and Herbert Marshall), than of today.  There was a story in the news this week about a controversial and racy billboard in Chicago that proclaimed ""Life's short. Get a divorce.""  The billboard was taken down after a week, over the objections of the two divorce attorneys who put it up, but there is no denying that divorces have become a lot more popular since Maugham's day (the high water marked was 1980 in the U.S. when the divorce rate topped out at 41%).  I bring this up because ""The Painted Veil"" is about two people who do not get divorced, and not because they are staying together for the sake of the children, because there are not any children.  It is a love story, but one of the most unromantic ones that I have ever seen, which is, rather surprisingly, not a bad thing.

Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts) is the daughter of an unambitious solicitor whose inflated idea of herself has seen her reject all possible suitors.  But when her younger sister marries and her mother (Maggie Steed) asks pointedly how long she intends to live off of her father, the confluence of events compels her to accept the marriage proposal of Walter Fane (Edward Norton), a young bacteriologist who is heading off to China.  This is hardly the foundation for a marriage and in Hong Kong the bored Kitty ends up having an affair with Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber).  When Walter discovers the affair he agrees to let Kitty divorce him if Townsend will divorce his wife and agree to marry Kitty.  When Townsend refuses Kitty is stunned, and with nowhere else to go she follows Walter as he volunteers to deal with a cholera epidemic in the interior of China.  It is there that the husband and wife find themselves changing.

The title of ""The Painted Veil"" is taken from a sonnet by Percy Bysshe Shelley, the opening sestet of which is quoted above, and I find it insightful that Maugham's characters do not take the poet's advice.  Almost of as much interest as what is happening between Walter and Kitty is the way he comes to understand that all of his scientific and medical knowledge is of no value if he cannot persuade the locals how to deal with the epidemic.  This is a minor part of the story, and it is the omnipresent threat of cholera that is of more importance to the way things work out in ""The Painted Veil,"" but still a nice little critique of the arrogance of Europeans in dealing with the Third World in the screenplay by Ron Nyswaner (""Philadelphia"").

Director John Curran (""We Don't Live Here Anymore"") was able to film the entire movie in China, but the beautiful vistas shot by Stuart Dryburgh (""The Piano"") serve as the setting for the story and never overwhelm it the way that usually happens in a David Lean epic.  The performances by the main characters, including Toby Jones as Waddington and Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior, are uniformly understated in keeping with the cultured reserve of their characters, and that may well explain why my appreciation for the moment of mutual redemption for Kitty and Walter is more intellectual than emotional.  Of course, back in the day this story was probably as much of a stiff-upper lip tearjerker as you were going to find in literature.

Final Note: The only extra you will find on this DVD is a trailer for the movie, but unless I have gone completely insane this is a different trailer than the one I saw on other DVDs that inspired me to check out this movie.  This one gives away specific details regarding the characters and plots that I do not remember seeing in that other trailer, which is why I was able to get into this movie with no expectations beyond that indicated by the presence of Norton, Watts and company that this film was going to take the high road (Update: I found that other trailer on another DVD and, indeed, it gives away very little of the story, which is much more effective than the one accompanying the actual movie).",1178755200,,4433,4.61704834605598
3142767,4,B001589S0E,"Based on M. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name, ""The Painted Veil"" explores a young couple's desperation and self-loathing that lead to self-discovery amid the lovely countryside and civil unrest of 1925 China. Kitty (Naomi Watts) was a London party girl who couldn't settle on a husband, much to her parents' chagrin. Family pressures and the opportunity to one-up her sister finally convinced Kitty to accept the proposal of a rather serious, bookish, and smitten bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton). Not her type. But they are shortly off to Shanghai, China, where Walter manages a government laboratory. Petulant, bored, and accustomed to being indulged, Kitty has an affair with conspicuously charming Vice Consul Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber). In anger, Walter insists that his wife accompany him to the interior of China, where he has volunteered to work at a hospital that is being deluged by the worst cholera epidemic in years.

Something is lacking in the attraction between these two characters, even as the emotional distance between them lessens. But what Walter and Kitty lack in chemistry, they make up for in gripping mutual and self-hatred. They do more than tempt fate to punish them; they compete to be the most brazenly self-destructive. The credit is mostly due Edward Norton, who imbues Walter's self-loathing with the calculated ferocity of a normally careful man who is deeply wounded. Kitty's desperate boredom and isolation in the countryside force her gaze inward. The chaotic, threatening eruption of disease and anti-foreign sentiment push the couple together. ""The Painted Veil"" has a anti-colonial air which might be misleading given Chiang Kai-Shek's  distaste for striking workers and his complex relationship with the Treaty Ports. But Walter's efforts to help peasant populations in spite of themselves comments on the double-edged sword of third world intervention. The intriguing milieu bolsters the film's inconsistently compelling emotions to create a successful character drama.

3142768,5,B001589S0E,"Years ago, I traveled in China and fell in love with her people and landscape. The Chinese setting, as well as the acting of Edward Norton (one of my generation's finest), led to my viewing of ""The Painted Veil."" I knew nothing of the story and came into it with no expectations.

The film starts with a marriage of expedience between a quiet, intelligent bacteriologist (Norton) and a British sophisticate (Naomi Watts), who wants to escape the clutches of her overbearing family. Norton's Dr. Fane leads Watts' Kitty to Shanghai, where Kitty slumps into a life of loneliness and self-absorption. The end result is an affair with another civil servant. But Dr. Fane is well aware of his wife's dalliances, eventually presenting her with a double-edged choice.

Kitty's self-made prison and Dr. Fane's equally imprisoning lack of forgiveness land the unloving couple in the middle of a cholera epidemic in a remote Chinese district. Through their duty to the sick, they come to truce of sorts, which evolves into unexpected grace.

With beautiful cinematography as a background for the subtle brilliance of Watts and Norton, ""The Painted Veil"" drew me slowly, quietly into its story. It moved me to tears. It made me laugh. And it served as a reminder of the core values which can serve as a foundation for any great work--whether it be in an orphanage, a hospital, a foreign country, or in the treacherous landscape of marriage.",1178668800,,1429,4.921161825726141
3142769,4,B001589S0E,"W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel had been made into films twice before actor-producer Edward Norton attempted it one more time. What they've made is a scrumptious, passionate film for the thinking crowd.

Kitty (Watts) is a bored socialite in London who has a romantic notion about marriage. Walter Fane (Norton) is a serious biologist who has been secretly in love with Kitty for years. Before Walter sets sail to Shanghai for a research post, he proposes to Kitty, who promptly laughs him off, because she simply doesn't love him. When Kitty's younger sister announces her wedding plans, out of embarrassment and the desire to move away from her parents, Kitty hastily accepts Walter's proposal.

In Shanghai, the Fanes lead rather separate lives. Walter immerses himself in work and neglects his bored wife. Meanwhile, Kitty falls for married diplomat Charlie Townsend (Schreiber). When Walter finds out about the affair, he gives Kitty an ultimatum: either go with him to a small village in the middle of a cholera epidemic, or face the scandal of a divorce on grounds of infidelity. Kitty has no choice but follow her husband.

Once at the village, Walter devotes all his time to his work, trying to find ways to contain the disease. His contempt for his wife is evident. Kitty befriends a former British commissioner, Waddington (Jones), a hedonistic man who serves as her only link to the world she once knew. Eventually, Walter and Kitty get to know each other better, and grow to care about each other while facing the horrific epidemic and the turbulent political climate in China.

Naomi Watts (King Kong) is completely believable as the complex Kitty, and she goes through a wide range of emotions and growth with conviction. In the beginning, she's naive, selfish, and confused. By the end she's mature and responsible and loving. The transformation is natural and she does a fine job letting us see deep into her character's soul. Edward Norton (The Illusionist) has the opposite challenge. His character starts off as being serious, arrogant, and dispassionate. We can empathize with Kitty's straying, given how little in common they have. By the end, Norton has given us a warm and great, altruistic man, and we can see how Kitty would fall deeply in love with him by then.

The supporting cast is superb. Toby Jones (Infamous) plays Waddington with humor, warmth, and earnestness. We form certain prejudices against his character, but his portrayal ultimately leaves us with the impression that he's a good guy. Dianna Rigg (Heidi) is delightful as Mother Superior of a convent in the village, offering comfort and wisdom to both Kitty and the audiences. And Hong Kong star Anthony Wong has an affecting turn as Colonel Yu, whose skepticism of the ""foreigners"" turns into genuine admiration.

Writer Ron Nyswaner (Philadelphia) has done a good job adapting the novel. He expands the cultural, social, and political elements of the story while keeping the focus on the relationship between the two leads. The historical backdrop and the cultural aspects of the story are fascinating. What transpires is a rich, multilayered character-driven story that feels real and relevant. The dialogue is sparse but insightful, the relationships between these characters are complex and flawed, and the themes and subtexts are moving.

Director John Curran (They Don't Live Here Anymore) has a grand vision for this film. The sets, the costumes, the production designs are spot on. The Painted Veil is also one of the few recent American films actually shot on location in China, and that gives the film a marvelous realism. Stuart Dryburgh's (The Beautiful Country) cinematography is gorgeous -- a definite feast for the eye. And Alexandre Desplat's (The Queen) scrumptious score complements the film perfectly, giving it a romantic yet despondent feel.

With its delicate production, stellar performances, deft direction, a smart script, and a poignant ending, The Painted Veil harks back to the golden days of Hollywood. It is one of these rare, old-fashioned romantic dramas that delight the senses and nurture the hearts and minds.

We see how the main characters are thrown together by circumstances and how their decisions shape their lives.  I didn't read the novel so I can't comment on how well the film adapts it but I found it to be very complete and satisfying, which is not always the case when a screenwriter has to cram hundreds of pages into into a two hour script.

You can tell that this was a labor of love for Ed Norton, whose performance as the repressed doctor is perfect.  His character is awkward and shy, more at home in a laboratory than at a party.  He is hardly attractive and so is powerfully attracted to his opposite--a beautiful, careless socialite who has nothing on her mind other than disliking her dreadful mother. Her mother forces her marry, or be cut off from support, so having no other option in sight,  she accepts the proposal of this hapless doctor.

A recipe for disaster! They go to China, where she is temporarily distracted, by another expatriot, a charming, married fellow, who possesses all the excitement that her poor husband lacks and they soon fall into something like love.  When her husband discovers her affair he forces her to accompany him  to rural China, where cholera is ravaging the population.  Wow!  If she thought life back in London was a bummer, this brings misery to a whole new level!

Besides cholera, there is political unrest, so danger presents itself on all sides.  She and her husband soon detest each other and she tries to contact her ex-lover to rescue her.  Alas! she learns that she was only one of a string of dalliances that this cad had indulged in.

This was a beautiful film - the scenery, soundtrack, and script all move to the same lulling pace, making this a character-driven story (albeit one lush enough to get lost in visually). The problem for me was that I didn't particularly like any of them - in fact, there is a brief scene with the Mother Superior where she reveals her own ""tainted love affair,"" and I found the energy of her too-short story more remarkable than anything we saw on-screen.

Perhaps I'm out of step, but when Norton's character shouted ""If you interrupt me again I will strangle you!"" to his wife, virtually everyone in the theater laughed except me. As revenge for her unfaithfulness, he drags his wife (Watts) - over land and without any inoculation - to a cholera stricken village in rural China. While we learn that he, too, has refused to be inoculated (he is searching for an excuse to die, seemingly), the fact does nothing to temper or mediate his cold and calculating vengeance. Through various twists and turns of the script we're told that he doesn't hate her, he hates himself, ""for every having allowed myself to love you once,"" but it is unconvincing. The bitter penalty he longs to exact is nothing short of her death - even later when he's beginning to care about her he refrains from suggesting protection from the disease. I was unable to conjure any sympathy for him throughout.

The fact that his wife then falls for him, that their love blooms in this remote and far-off land, is perhaps not unsurprising (what else is there to do?) but it is a little shocking that he saves his apology for his dying breath. And that she tolerates so little so willingly for so long.

Some reviewers are making a fuss about the actors' silly accents, but they don't distract from the film at all - and it is a good film. In all reality a very enjoyable one, whether you share my considerations or instead find the love story moving and romantic. But some serious questions regarding social issues about men, women, marriage, love, and hate linger long afterwards.",1172275200,,2068,4.673076923076923
3142775,5,B001589S0E,"Co-produced and co-starring Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, W. Somerset Maugham's novel comes to life in living color.  Beautiful cinematography and symphonic music embellish a wonderful, heart-warming story of love and forgiveness.

Kitty (Watts) is getting older.  Living in 1920's London, her parents have more to say with impunity about her suitors.  Quick to pursue her, Walter Fane (Norton) pushes himself for courtship against her wishes, but the timing leaves her no choice but wedlock.  Interrupted in their social life, they become a foursome with Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) and his wife.  Charlie, a virile alternative to her drab, doctor husband, tempts her into adultery.  In such an arrangement, women didn't have the freedoms they do now.  So when Walter is assigned to treat a cholera epidemic in Shanghai,  he's privy to her affair and can blackmail her to come along or face the scorn of divorce.  Since her lover is a playboy who abhors attachment anyway, she again has no choice.

Life in China at first offers nothing more than disease and disenchantment.  Bored with her life and keeping in seclusion to avoid cholera, her husband spreads nothing but flinty resentment toward her unfaithful presence.  Besides a stunning landscape, she discovers a convent where a wise, old mother superior charms her heart and inspires her to do at first repellant work with the orphans.  Besides the dangers of disease, the locals are slow to warm up to any foreigner's presence, even one that may offer a solution to their health crisis.

More moving than its beautiful cinematography, Norton's and Watt's splendid performances work well with a captivating story of lust and love, betrayal and forgiveness, and selfishness turned to self-giving.  While some viewers may find some of the old-fashioned elements of the film languorous in places, I feel the picture clocks in just right for the state of affairs.  Superbly crafted, 'Painted Veil' is complete with a heart-melting beauty for the soul as well as for the eyes.",1171152000,,2035,5.13677811550152
3142776,4,B001589S0E,"Some stories portray life in many shades and make all the shades look equally remarkable, even though some shades are bright and some are truly gloomy. The Painted Veil is an outstanding example of such a versatlie story. The movie brilliantly narrates the lives of a couple who marry to pursue conflicting goals and end up uniting in every way. Ed Norton and Naomi Watts deliver one of the best performances of their lives and leave the audience spell bound in a movie that boasts of nothing dramatic and yet is a drama in the purest form. Set in England and China of 1920's, this movie depicts the love, the lack of it, and again the love between a couple whose pursuits were different but led them to one goal. To sum it, The Painted Veil is a sedate, sober and yet stunningly beautiful movie that will engage and enthrall you.",1170633600,,830,4.503311258278146
3142777,5,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time - very moving!  It has great acting, casting and cinematography, but the storyline is what makes it best.  It's about love, life and forgiveness.",1170288000,,215,4.35
3142778,5,B001589S0E,"To be honest, I might not have seen this film if it hadn't been playing at the right theater at a convenient time.  Sure, I was aware of the source material, and I generallly enjoy the actors involved.  But I'd have easily missed it.

The plot essentials: Kitty marries Walter simply to get away from her stubborn, small-minded parents, who have given up on her.  Walter, a doctor doing research in China, is all head and no heart.  Kitty is all heart and no head.  Not a good match.  Once they get to China, Kitty quickly has an affair.  When Walter finds out, he offers a choice: immediate divorce, which would be scandalous, or she follows him to a cholera ridden region.  It quickly seems clear that this is Walter's way of trying to kill her.

And this is just the beginning.  Obviously, there's a lot of melodrama here, yet the movie underplays everything.  There are no grand speeches, no spectacular fights.  And the two main characters are hard to care for, given that they only seem half there: Walter completely lacking emotion or the ability to converse, Kitty foolishly believing that romance is substance.  So what's remarkable is that the audience sort of falls in love with this pair, just as they, unexpectedly, fall in love, eventually, with each other.  This is tricky, and most filmakers would make a big, cheesy deal of the moment when their feelings finally come clear.  That it is a smaller moment here makes it even more touching.

I'm sure there are some people who rather the big, noisy version of this story, with the characters turned more sympathetic, and cues telling us how we should feel.  Not me.  I admired the fact that the director and screenwriter trusted me enough to understand things on my own.

There were only two small things that didn't work for me: the timeline of events is confusing, not because of flashbacks, but simply because it is hard to tell how much time has passed.  And the final scene, in which we find out ""what happened next"", is totally unneccessary.",1169337600,,2011,4.65625
3142779,1,B001589S0E,"It's obvious The Painted Veil is geared to people who are fairly educated. Baltimore is a fairly large city, and only one small theater that I'm aware of showed this movie! So I find it hard to believe the filmmakers, in their infinite wisdom, needed to show extremely graphic images of people dying of Cholera, not to mention grotesque scenes of corpses, to the very people who already have a pretty good idea about what dying from Cholera is all about.

As a result of being caught off guard by these rather gruesome images, I literally lost my dinner after the movie was over. Where do I send the bill? Can anything be left to the imagination, anymore? Why are so many films these days so morbid? Is the movie going public becoming so desensitized that nothing is shocking? Are American filmmakers helping to turn us into a nation of mindless voyeurs? If I wanted, or needed, to learn more about Cholera, all I have to do is hop on the Internet, or God-forbid, pick-up a book, and read. I didn't need to spend my hard earned money to be nauseated!

All I can say is thank God for the scientist who invented the purification process for public drinking water - he should be nominated for sainthood! And the next time you gripe about your Government spending money on foreign aid in very poor countries, keep this movie in mind! For Cholera still kills plenty of people in the developing world, each, and every day - because a huge segment of the human race still does not have access to safe drinking water!

3142780,4,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil is yet another Edward Norton period drama, complete with a lushness and beauty that no one can create but contemporary film. Wow, does this movie look good. The fields, the haze, the villages, the river, the furniture and mud all reek of the real stuff. It is gorgeous to look at, with a graceful musical score that lovingly enhances the story. Details are great. It looks as good as it could.

So where does it not quite measure up? Heart. A film with two cold and self-absorbed main characters needs some potent chemistry to overcome the inherent off-putting-ness of such remote protagonists. And this movie didn't do accomplish that. She is a silly, childish whiner, easily manipulated by a shark who adds another notch to his bedpost. He is cocky and cold, remote and though apparently inflamed with lust, unable to show it. Now, this chilliness is important for the story, as they must grow and overcome the huge obstacles they have built for themselves. But it also makes them harder to care about, making a cerebral, rather than visceral, experience.

But the slow pacing and the gradual changes, while all plausible and consistent, somehow just felt too small for so much buildup. There are several good themes explored here: beauty is not a good reason for love; those who claim to want us will say whatever they need to say to get what they want; you can love virtue far more than looks; service and occupation fill a life as amusements cannot. These are all things Kitty realizes that she would never have learned had she remained a 1920s English Valley girl. But it was just too little for the knockout such material could have provided. Worth watching. Just somewhat disappointing.",1168300800,,1711,4.796610169491525

3375442,5,B001589S0E,"One of the great advantages of film is that it can start with a story that appeared in another art form, namely literature, and by giving it a careful and creative reading the script writer can alter it, in major or little ways, to enhance its meaning and effect. Such changes can alter the thematic content for the better. This is the case with this story. In the Somerset Maugham's novel, upon which it is based, the main character, played here to perfection by Naomi Watts, is condemned to relive her life of static growth. However, in the film, which emphasizes the blunt but often overlooked fact that life is education, the characters not only reach out beyond the poet Shelley's 'painted veil'  to moral rectitude but also take the giant step of increasing their humanity by the simple but terribly difficult act of forgiveness.
  Another way in which the film can move beyond the novel upon which it is based is by its blunt and colorful presentation of the time and place in which the story takes place. If it be true (and I believe it is) that 'one picture is worth a thousand words' then this film which is a picture, though careful selection of location and great cinematography,  that revels in the awesome beauty of a Chinese backwater location not only stimulates the viewer's imagination but increases his appreciation for things unknown and, by doing so, becomes another way to convince the viewer that life is a tantalizing bouquet waiting to be unveiled despite its transient beauty. The point is made economically in a scene near the end of the film when the main character purchases a flower, knowing full well that its beauty will not last.  So too, the growth in human values pictorially represented by the camera, drawing back to a Hitchcockian  divine height to see the main character cross the busy street called life.
  One significant way by which a film can make its point beyond the form of the novel, which relies completely on the lyrical flow of language alone, is through the addition of music. Here the tantalizing gems written by Eric Satie, a french composer living and writing at the time in which the novel and the film were set, zero in on the bittersweet and persistent ambiguity of life.
  There are some who berate the story but this being its third film adaption must be evidence there are some who see its great potential significance. I think in this third adaption it has achieved that significance. Bravo to all concerned!  Adding this film to your collection and viewing it from time to time will enhance your life.",1474675200,,2564,4.713646532438479

3375461,5,B001589S0E,"This exceptional film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel of the same title deserves more credit than the box office paid it a decade ago.

Set amid the Nationalist Revolution in China (and filmed in that country) in the 1920s, the plot teeters atop the the wall of emotional and political meltdown. Ed Norton (as the bacteriologist Walter Fane) and Liev Schreiber (as the philandering British consul Charles Townsend) turn in solid performances, but in this reviewer's eyes it is Naomi Watts who shines as Kitty Garston. Ignored by the husband who prefers the thrill of infectious diseases to his hot wife, she turns to Townsend and his bed for comfort.

The film splits time between early-20th-century Shanghai and the remote location to which Dr. Fane compels his adulterous wife to follow him as punishment. The camera captures both venues sumptuously, but it is the peaked landscape of the countryside that the visuals reach their dazzling potential, all amid the human chaos of a ravaging cholera epidemic.

When the bored Kitty finds both her place and her passion in tending to the children of a Catholic orphanage, Norton's Dr. Fane realizes what he has lost. His cruelty towards Kitty melts and love is re-born, just in time for cholera to snatch him away from Kitty before they can reinitiate the life that might have been if  hearts were softer and memories shorter. Her chance encounter with Townsend on a London street years later is a jaw-dropping emotional finale.

The Painted Face is a strong story well told, well spoken, well shot, and well framed by a gorgeous score.

He manages a government laboratory in Shanghai. Kitty lives at home, she's getting older, and her parents are pressuring her to find a husband. Dr. Fane takes an interest in Kitty, he loves her or was falling in love and proposes to her. She's reluctant but given his status and her father's urging, she accedes. Dr. Fane is devoted to his work, and it takes precedence to everything even his wife. For Kitty, her life is lonely and dull until she begins an affair with the lively, vivacious Dr. Charlie Townsend. Due to a cholera outbreak, Dr. Fane and Kitty go to Mei-tan-fu, a small town on a tributary of the Yangtze River in the interior of China, to contain the epidemic of this fatal disease.

3375482,5,B001589S0E,"A young woman, with pressure from her parents, marries a doctor who specializes in micro-organisms. He tells her he loves her, but the love isn't mutual. She begins a brief affair, but then her husband tells her about an offer he can't pass up. China is in the grip of a yellow fever epidemic, and she is plunged into a life of misery. The house they live in is old and in terrible condition. She is surrounded by strange people, whose customs she cannot understand. But it is as it is, and slowly, she works at conquering boredom and finding fulfillment in a way one can't imagine.
Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are brilliant at characterization, and we see a time in China where the overlord treats his people no better than slaves. I highly recommend this marvelous version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel.",1462579200,,810,4.593103448275862
3375483,4,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil is a bit of romance, but mostly drama.  It's about Naomi Watts who sleeps with a man (Liev Schreiber) and disobeying her husband in the process (Edward Norton).  Naomi gets the surprise of her life when Edward reveals he was aware of it, so guess what he does?
Well nothing too bad I suppose since the film takes place in England and China in the early 1900's, but still, something pretty twisted.  Since Edward's a doctor, he makes her go to China with him as the country battles a cholera epidemic (and he volunteered to help).  What a husband!

Guess Naomi shouldn't have said she never really loved him.  Those were some hurtin' words.  Obviously he's bitter about his wife cheating on him, so this is basically his revenge.  Didn't quite make sense when the two were arguing and Edward said he'd get the divorce papers, only to change his mind a moment later and threaten Naomi that she must go to China with him.  I think that's how it went down- can't remember the precise details.

While in China the two basically ignore each other, sleep in separate rooms and only speak to each other occasionally due to Edward intially refusing to forgive and forget (that changes later).  They soon meet up with Toby Jones (a British man who never left) and a colonel (played by Anthony Wong Chau Sang) who's often reasonable with Edward's decisions considering the dire situation the Chinese are in at the time.  Meanwhile Toby can sense Naomi's in an unhappy relationship based on the way her husband never makes eye contact her, so for the longest time Naomi stays around the house or occasionally visits the town until she gets a job at the local church and plays piano/teaches the kids.

The setting takes place out in the mountains of China which is a part of the country I personally love!  So basically while Edward is trying to take care of sick people and finding ways to change the water supply so fresh water is being carried into town without much of a hassle (much to the dislike of the Chinese who apparently don't mind drinking contaminated water), Naomi is either stuck at home or helping kids in some way.  She's obviously miserable, but that doesn't stop her from trying to make the best of things.  Occasionally the cholera disease comes into the writing when we see deceased people either in bed or outside on the ground, and Naomi and Edward have to make sure they don't touch anything in case the disease might still be lingering around.

I won't spoil the ending but I guess looking back it's the best conclusion they could have.  You can't really put a positive spin on cholera though.  Basically Naomi gets pregnant with Liev's baby and well, I won't say anything else about it.  Obviously Edward isn't happy about it.  It's sort of funny whenever the one Chinese guard follows Naomi around, perhaps because the Chinese weren't on good terms with the British and Americans at the time (early 1900's) and probably thought Naomi was up to no good.

Overall this movie's really great but perhaps it could stand to have a little more substance.  It's definitely a light story.  Would have been nice to see Naomi get involved more with the town activities, or have the Chinese play a bigger role instead of being background characters.  At least near the end the Chinese ruler gets some time when Edward and Anthony pay him a visit (and it doesn't go too well for poor Edward trying to explain the horrible epidemic and the changes that need made only to find himself getting rejected).  Then again I've read some of this stuff in the movie isn't depicted properly.

The Painted Veil has its share of memorable scenes such as the Chinese teenagers chasing after Naomi after they realize she's British (who knows what they would have done had Edward not come to her rescue!) and later when more potentially infected Chinese come marching across the mountains and make themselves at home.  The first 20 minutes might be boring to some (and pretentious due to the acting) but after Naomi cheats on her husband the story changes in a big way.

This is a SPOILER but I couldn't help but think Naomi was clueless and didn't really understand the magnitude of cheating on her husband.  The final scene with her husband when the line ""I forgive you"" comes to mind.  Pretty sure the wrong person is uttering those words...  On a final note, Naomi looks really cute as a brunette.",1462492800,,4404,4.649870801033591

I admired the potraiture of people as people -- complex, determined, adaptable. I would recommend it for a view on these counts alone. The film is lacking in a few respects. The plot does not drive the film but complicates it. The politics involved with the military, villagers, warlords, etc. are distracting and prevent the emotional tensions between the two main characters from playing out in the foreground. The lack of a memorable scoring contributes to the overall lack of emotional punch to the movie.

I also love how his last words were, ""Kitty, Kitty, forgive me."" She says there is nothing to forgive. It is sad that he dies, but triumphantly that his love for her did not go in vain, and that he won her despite her spoiledness and lack of love for him at first.

3375586,5,B001589S0E,"Set against the backdrop of the Chinese uprising against British colonial rule, The"" Painted Veil"" is a true, old-style-Hollywood, romantic/psychological drama. Adapted from the 1934  W. Somerset Maugham novel, it recalls a time when a couple married and then learned to love each other. The couple in this story must travel a cruel and bumpy road to reach a mutual love and respect for each other.

Edward Norton and Naomi Watts play this couple, Walter and Kitty Fane. I'll watch any movie these two are in and they are mesmerizing together in this film.

The music and cinematography are worth noting. There's something almost magical about the way this movie was filmed. It's one of those movies where I forget myself and become part of what I'm watching.",1432944000,,759,4.9140625

3375595,5,B001589S0E,"Producers Naomi Watts and Edward Norton deserve high praise for bringing this, the third movie version of Maugham's novel, to the screen. Equal praise is due them for their splendid acting in the leading roles. If anything, just as much praise might be due Ron Nyswaner for what could have very well been a thankless task  -  that of writing the screenplay. Those, including myself, who love Maugham's novel are poised to object to the changes Nyswaner made in order to make the novel work as a movie. And major changes are what he made, from adding significant events that do not appear in the book to giving the story a much happier, though not exactly happy, ending.  It's hard for me, as a non-professional to see how this works, but it goes along with my theory that writers of successful screen adaptations/screenplays are remarkably gifted. I think especially of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala for her work for the Merchant-Ivory team and Emma Thompson for her work on the Ang Lee production of ""Sense and Sensibility"".
The scenes added by Nyswaner to ""The Painted Veil"", especially the play at which Townsend first flirts with Kitty, the later encounter with the local Chinese warlord, and especially the euphoric completion of the ingenious aqueduct, are so rich and enjoyable and lend such depth to the overall result that they do not seem out of place.  The happier ending might be harder to justify, since it clearly goes against Maugham's intention, but with all the good will built up by that time, it's hard to be the curmudgeon who would object. I do not mean to leave out Liev Schreiber and Toby Jones, who are also perfect in their roles, or the remarkably apt use of music on the sound track, including one by Erik Satie. That the film is also very beautiful to look at hardly needs mentioning.",1430611200,,1803,4.714285714285714

3375631,5,B001589S0E,"I rarely rate a movie adaptation over its source material, but The Painted Veil leaves Somerset Maugham's original novel in the dust. The basic story, setting and characters are preserved: A British doctor, shattered by his wife's extra-marital affair, embarks on a suicide mission with her in tow to a cholera-plagued Chinese village, c. 1925. However, where the book consistently slaps the reader in the face and doesn't allow the characters to grow, the movie adds warmth, color and detail. It creates more political suspense, enhances the husband's character, and allows the couple to fall in love as the crisis situation intensifies.

At no point do the characters' journeys become saccharine or implausible. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts put in skillful, subtle performances of complex characters, and we become fully invested in their marriage. Toby Jones is no less excellent as the deputy commissioner who observes the couple with compassion and uncanny wisdom. The breathtaking Chinese landscape, shot on location, might also be considered a character in its own right.

The film is not perfect. There are a couple of awkward digressions into religion and politics. In particular, the adapters don't seem to understand how to approach the Catholic faith (which Maugham did understand, for all the other faults of the original book). There are also a couple of loose ends in the plot. But in the end, The Painted Veil is a powerful human story about love, forgiveness, and coming of age. It is Edward Norton's finest hour, and it is not to be missed.",1424476800,,1559,5.0859375

3375646,5,B001589S0E,"The English word ""resent"" or ""resentment"" comes from the Old French resentir ""feel again, feel in turn"" (13c.) That is, to replay and feel again and again and again the thoughts and emotions relating to something negative that's already happened/affected you, as in visions of your wife having sex with another man and laughing at you.

This novel is Somerset Maugham's calamitous case study on the travesties begotten by a faithless, heartless and, frankly, gullible cheating wife, and of the cuckold's emotional pain and the overpowering poison of his resentment.

Kitty Fane ruthlessly ridicules her husband, Dr. Walter Fane, to her lover and dreams of marrying this cad who she cannot see is playing her. Though the husband Walter loves Kitty still, after he finds out of the affair, his selfish desire for revenge makes him decide to take her with him to the heart of the cholera epidemic in rural China where, ironically, he selflessly works around the clock to save these people.

Prior to departing for China, he asks her:
""How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode.""
***
""I know that you're selfish, selfish beyond words, and I know that you haven't the nerve of a rabbit, I know you're a liar and a humbug, I know that you're utterly contemptible. And the tragic part is'--her face was on a sudden distraught with pain--'the tragic part is that notwithstanding I love you with all my heart.""
*****

Nevertheless, off they go. Kitty awakens too late to the fallacy of her fantasy love and the spinelessness of her beau, who (get a hold of this) was really only interested in sex. Kitty undergoes self-discovery, finds her moral compass, and seeks forgiveness, while resentment threatens to consume Walter.

Maugham couldn't have found a more appropos place to explore the most disastrous tragedy to a marriage (an affair) and set up a plethora of symbols on the after-effects of infidelity to contrast with society's notions of a husband and wife, against the background theater of the mind running scenes of the ungrateful wife screwing another man and mocking her husband.

3375743,3,B001589S0E,I am rewatching this movie again. I really enjoy the scenery n like when they take the boat ride n talk about the water wheel. It is the only time I feel his trip helped the Chinese people.  The scene of negotiation with the warlord showed some of chinese culture known only to the Chinese.  The idea of the trip seemed suicidal.  I would have died of boredom in the shack with absolutely nothing to do or like. The neighbor guy at least knew their was an outlet from total dreariness. Interesting those mountains are from avatar movie. Walter was a nasty man with a low testosterone count.  The little boys face is clearly her lovers not Walters. Perhaps more punishment for her affair that her son will not have even the few good qualities Walter had.  I liked her but what a terrible social trap she lived in as many women still do .  Now we know more about cholera n it's all horrible.,1414713600,,889,4.357575757575757

We were both spoiled brats and expected so much from our kind-hearted husbands. After the movie ended, like a successful therapy, I treated my husband differently. I tried not to be so demanding, and be a supportive wife. That's how much this movie has changed my life for the better. I have rewatched this movie many times since.

In most cases, especially when it comes to beloved books, one is cynical about movie adaptations of the same, especially if you are gifted/plagued by an overactive imagination. Somehow, the movie version is often a let down if in your imagination the settings were far more beautiful. I am happy to report that this is not the case with The Painted Veil. Every frame is set artfully with a graceful, timeless elegance, which was well thought out by the director. The actors are fantastic and costumes are perfect. The setting is changed from Hong Kong to Shanghai and the love angle in the story trends differently from the book but truth be told, it's a far more believable version and I infinitely preferred it after the initial 'eh, what?' knee jerk reaction.

3375904,5,B001589S0E,"This is the third movie adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel of the same name. This version, released in January of 2007, tells the story of a young woman, Kitty Fane, compellingly played by Naomi Watts, who has carefully avoided the painful job of growing up and acting like an adult.

Events conspire that compel her to move to China with her new husband, Dr. Walter Fane, played by Edward Norton, at a time when China was becoming increasingly involved in a  shift from war lords to a stronger national government. Along with that shift, a cholera epidemic demands her husband's full attention leaving Kitty to fend for herself which she does rather badly. After making her fair share of mistakes, Kitty begins to realize her need to grow up and start looking beyond her own needs and wants.

The scenery is both striking and alien looking; the filming took place in China. The acting and general ambience of the movie holds the viewers attention and creates an impression of depth and scope. The story was well crafted and made one feel the hand of a master literary craftsman had been involved in its creation.

Sadly there are no special features on this disc; one would think the making of this movie would deserve a lot of special attention and open many doors for interesting background information, but there is nothing on the making of this movie.

The movie is serious, intense, and very dramatic; although it is only rated PG-13 I would consider carefully before letting it be viewed by young children.",1400716800,,1525,4.761363636363637

3375935,4,B001589S0E,"This wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it. So the set up is that a woman marries someone she barely knows and doesn't quite love, she has an affair with a married man, but due to the time period (1920s) she finds herself trapped in the marriage. Because her husband knew of the affair, the marriage is now very strained and uncomfortable to watch at times. They move to a remote village in China so the husband can help with the cholera epidemic. It is here where the wife is forced to grow up and the couple has the time to learn about each other, and come to love each other. I wish this part of the story lasted longer and wonder if the book may have been more satisfactory in that department. The scenery, however, was spectacular. I have never much been interested in visiting China, but there is no way those mountain peaks don't capture your attention. And right along with that is the beautiful musical score. The cinematography and score were well suited to each other and just made you feel like were in the time and place. Overall, it was an interesting character study of two people and as a viewer I could easily feel the emotional ups and downs.",1398816000,,1176,4.423963133640553

3375960,4,B001589S0E,"Virtually all stories begin with...""the stranger walked into town...""  Yours, ours, theirs....our challenges (conflicts) begin when we enter uncharted territory which may be a country, a group of strangers, the workplace or the human heart.  ""The Painted Veil"" succeeds brilliantly on two levels: it takes  Dr. Walter and Kitty Fane into rural China of 1925 with a cholera epidemic while simultaneously taking us into the wasteland of Kitty's heart:  Oscar Wilde said: the only thing worse than a loveless marriage is a marriage where only one partner loves the other.""  Walter loves Kitty but she is still locked into child-like selfishness and self-ignorance, casting here for an affair with Charles Townsend, there for her own safety and health, while her husband selflessly delves into helping cholera-infected Chinese peasants while locking away his love for Kitty...having given up hope.  Not incidentally, the music of ""Veil""  is absolutely wonderful, enhancing the story's imagery of every scene, doubling the force of its emotional intensity and intimacy.  Production design is sensitive, often using moving veils, ""noir"" lighting techniques where less becomes more thus allowing viewer to use his/her own imagination to live into the scene.  But the telling power of this film is it's ability to appear shallow with the Walter's sullen resentment of the family's ""dirty little secret"", while heroically plunging into his life's work which also plummets the depth of his love.....(see Corinthians I)  What I particularly loved was how the director kept me from knowing who was the protagonist, i.e., who must be transformed by the story's experience? until the last part of the film.  Entertains, holds you, pacey in spots while slowing in other parts to allow viewer time to absorb/experience the moment.

3376036,3,B001589S0E,"Like liverwurst, about every year or so I get a hankering for a period piece especially when it takes place in the dwindling light of the sunset of the British Empire.  The Painted Veil is definitely Saturday afternoon rainy day viewing.

It's 1920 and her doctor husband is dragging her the long way through the back roads of China.  Flashback two years and we meet Kitty at home where her well-to-do parents never miss a chance to worry out loud that their youngest daughter will soon be too old to find a man.  At a party they've arranged for a young doctor, Walter, to meet her he asks her to dance, followed by the hint of wooing in which he proclaims his love so of course they marry and end up in Shanghai.

While Walter works at the local clinic as an epidemiologist Kitty gets bored.  Lucky for philanderer Charlie Townsend.  Walter discovers the torrid affair and signs up for cholera camp taking his unhappy wife away from the city and into the hinterland where cholera is spreading almost as fast as nationalism.

The Empire's best days are behind it and things are literally going to s*** for everyone.  Throw in memories of Fitzcaraldo and a pinch of African Queen along with strong performances and a director's touch able to tell the story of catharsis and redemption through moving images more so than through dialogue and you get a sweet little picture with a satisfying ending.

This is a re-do of the Greta Garbo film of the same name released in 1934 and based on Somerset Maugham book.  I think I'd like to see the Great Garbo version.  So that means I'll have having liverwurst twice this year.",1393459200,,1617,4.576388888888889

3376092,5,B001589S0E,"The time is 1925, the place China. Dr. and Mrs. Walter Fane, having lived in Shanghai for two years, are traveling to a remote area of the country because of a cholera epidemic, despite the fact that Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is a bacteriologist, not a physician. He and Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) have lived in China since they were first married.

The trip to the cholera-infested village is a far cry from that of their arrival, as there is a palpable tension between them. It seems that Kitty was unfaithful to him with the Vice Consul of Shanghai, Charlie Townsend (Liev Schrieber). When Walter tells her of the epidemic he has volunteered to help with, she informs him that is no place for a woman, and refuses to go... until he tells her if she does not, he will file for divorce, which would be a heavy blow to her social position.

The Painted Veil, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, explores the relationship between Walter and Kitty against the backdrop of the epidemic. I've covered the story in more depth in my review of the book. When I saw there was a film, I was curious to know how well it was adapted to the screen.

The story has been fleshed out somewhat, of necessity, as the novel is in Kitty's POV, which does not tell us as much as we'd like of Walter and his mindset. I think the screenwriter bridged the gap rather well, and Edward Norton brings him to life, endearing him to me in a way the novel never did.

Naomi Watts plays Kitty well. She begins the film as a shallow, empty-headed woman whose sole goal in life is to be married, not for love but because it's the thing to do. She justifies her affair to herself because she doesn't love Walter, and she believes herself in love with Charlie. Well, Walter helps her to see Charlie for what he really is. Her journey is one of self-discovery. At the beginning, Walter loves her very much and she barely sees him, but over the course of the film, she comes to realize his true worth, as well as her own, as they find one another.

Can love make everything right? Unfortunately, some things are beyond its ability to heal, and the film has a bittersweet ending.

It is a well-done adaptation of the novel, and even though it romanticizes their relationship at the end, I think I prefer the changes, which make a potentially depressing film into a sad one. It may not be action-packed--Maugham's stories seldom are--but it possesses a definite depth of character. Look for Toby Jones (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) as Waddington, the Englishman that becomes Kitty's confidante in a strange land.

The cinematography is beautiful, and so is the music that is used in the soundtrack.

I highly recommend this film if you enjoy such films as The English Patient.",1393113600,,2743,4.538461538461538

Along comes this man who is more than interested in your daughter but the feelings aren't mutual. She marries him anyway. Gets bored and finds companionship in the arms of another man who is likewise encumbered to a spouse. Of course they are found out. The husband who has been cheated on decides to go where the need is greater to help out a medical emergency that's way over his head and take her with him or offers her a divorce if the other man will leave his spouse and marry her. Of course he won't do that because it's not fair to his spouse to be dumped like that...lesson learned.. grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence... duh!!!

When I wanted to watch the movie, I was skeptical if the on-screen version adequately preserved the intricacies of Maugham's unique style. It indeed did, and I am grateful and relieved that nothing was compromised. Hats off to the crew for producing such a masterpiece.",1392595200,,425,5.085714285714285
3376155,5,B001589S0E,"I rented this film from the library after seeing in on many occasions on the shelf.  Took it home and was stunned by the wonderful story and acting.  Naomi and Edward were perfect from start to finish.  This is a great movie.  I was delighted by her independence and disdain for marriage and how he loved her at hello.  They seem to be so many worlds apart as far as what each wanted from life and their reasons for entering the marriage.

Then enters the sexy and strong Liam who no man should leave alone with his (unhappy) wife.  SA:  There's an affair and a huge revelation that only one of them is truly in love.  The woman has to deal with the fallout from losing her husband (figuratively) and lover!

3376185,4,B001589S0E,"This film started out slow. However once you get past a certain point, mine was after the move to the Countryside, the film came together. For me the WHOLE premise was that of Love. Love takes on many forms. What the meaning of love for us is not the same for others, shown in the British man and his young Chinese girlfriend. Love means to forgive and sticking by the vow you took of in sickness and health til death us part. The gift Naomi Watts gets for her commitment and renewed love is beyond measure, and I was touched by this. The scenery is almost unreal in its beauty! Wow... I bet it was great for cast and crew to film. I would definitely recommend this film, but KNOW it is slow paced and a love story. If you like films in this category with history and a beautiful country thrown in, you may be surprisingly satisfied.

who superbly crafted the movie to give the viewer this appeal. The casting of Naomi Watts and Edward Norton as Kitty and Walter was perfect!

3376369,5,B001589S0E,"I won't give much synopsis of this movie as there are others that have already done so excellently. Therefore, I will only mainly gush about how my limited ""movie genre horizons"" could have prevented me from missing out on one of a most amazing piece of film ever to have graced the screens.

Let me start off by saying that the one sentence summary of this movie immediately had me yawning. Typically love stories do not appeal to me. I think the last time I watched a love movie was right when the English Patient came out on VHS tape and two birds chasing each other outside my living room window looked more interesting to watch. That movie put a damper on any peak interest in the movie category. Fast forward to now. I came across this film and only clicked on it to read what it was all about because 886 reviewers got the film rated at 4.5 stars. I crossed my fingers hoping I will not have just wasted another precious few minutes of my life by giving this film my time of day and THEN I gave it a go!

DN DN DNNNNN.....WOW is ALL I really need to say about it!! But I'll gush a tad bit more!

The movie being about love is merely a fraction of the movie. Yes, it includes it. It serves as an underlying impetus for some of the main the actions that take place and the plot isn't focused on just lovers alone; it addresses many themes like compassion, forgiveness, understanding. The movie takes you through some of life's most important and most powerful emotions that which can make or break us. I took a liking to Edward Thornton's character. If Naomi Watt's character didn't fall in love with him in the end,  I CERTAINLY DID--for his larger than life role in the name of ""love"", and In the name of love from many aspects. I couldn't help but throw a tear in there too. AMAZING film!",1389830400,,1796,4.320474777448071
3376370,4,B001589S0E,"A study in conflict.  My main objection is that my sympathy--at least--went in one direction.  Is this what the author intended?  I grew quite impatient with the ""good doctor""--yes, his situation was sad--but his revenge belittled him, as his lack of emotional contact brought him into it in the first place.",1389830400,,308,5.0

3376373,5,B001589S0E,"Having seen previews of this movie, we were anxious to see if the whole film lived up to the trailer. Set in 1920's rural China and based on the work of a famous novelist, we were not disappointed. Edward Norton and Naomi Watt portray real people with characteristics of tunnel vision, selfishness, pride, and integrity.... realistic depictions of normal humans who are often guided by emotions more than thought. The story evolves nicely into one of respect and love, even though the fairy tale happy ending is not available. The imagery of the countryside was magnificent, all while showing the despair of a backward people fighting disease, ignorance, political upheaval, and religious differences. We looked at each other when it was over and said, Wow, that was a great movie.",1389657600,,781,5.015384615384615

3376414,4,B001589S0E,This is a really beautiful film about how profound love develops between two people.  This is revealed in the film by contrasting superficial love with this deep and abiding love.  I found the film to be very moving not in the superficial way that Hollywood films tend to manipulate our feelings but in a genuine way created in part by the poetically slow pace of the film.,1388793600,,373,4.552238805970149
3376415,4,B001589S0E,"Certainly, this is a period piece where attention is paid to the norms and conventions which provide surfaces for the actions of the characters.  However, it is essentially a love story.  In something of a parallel to arranged marriages, the two protagonists marry for the wrong reasons and something of a disaster ensues.  However, through something of mutual discovery under difficult and demanding circumstances, attractive qualities become evident which trump the selfish motives that first impelled their union.  I suppose that this is a romantic story and one grounded in a generally positive, liberal view of humanity.  If we posit only the self and its aggressions and defenses as the only true purpose of existence, what do we teach our children?  How can we read any literature without scoffing?  There is something refreshing in this film coming, as it does, from seemingly another age.",1388793600,,897,5.1875

The setting is 1925 China, a turbulent time, if you remember The Sand Pebbles. The film asks the question: What do you do when you're not happy but you find yourself in faraway China--alone and without means.

3376441,5,B001589S0E,"I began this movie wandering if I would finish it because the summary did not sound particularly appealing to myself. However, I became interested from the get-go, and this movie never lost my attention. It may be a bit slow, but any faster and I do not believe it would be quite as moving. (If you watch it you will find out why.)

I have a close friend who is studying to be a doctor, as she wants to help people in remote places. And I haven't really considered/understood what her passions could entail. I am sure this movie does not begin to uncover tragedies around the world that could be fixed with simple things like clean drinking water, but nonetheless, it has opened my eyes.

Concerning the love interests in the film--I'm going to be honest--I became a heaping puddle of tears(which doesn't happen often) about halfway through after which my state only intensified. (i.e. laying on my couch weeping at 4 in the morning during a Christmas break) I should have started my break with this movie instead of ending with it. For people are imperfect/twisted, but there is hope because people can change. And this change can flourish; even if born in a harsh desert, it can grow.

Overall, ""The Painted Veil"" has reminded me about the problems of humanity and the impact of love and grace by and in caring for humans, by being selfless.",1388188800,,1343,4.610878661087866

For me the story was so touching and the acting by everyone in the movie was just so wonderful. Not only were Watts and Norton excellent, but Toby Jones and Diana Rigg characters were important observers of the troubled couple who got married for all the wrong reasons and then slowly fell in love for all the right reasons.

The music along with the scenery made for an enchanting backdrop.  I think S Maugham would have been quite pleased with this interpretation of his work.

3376487,5,B001589S0E,This adaptation of Maugham's The Painted Veil takes many liberties with the book but I love it anyways.

These two uncompromising spouses learn so many life lessons during the short period of their marriage while living in China during the 1920s.

3376556,5,B001589S0E,"General plot: Watts plays a self centered and spoiled young woman living off her fathers money whose family is pushing her to marry. Instead of going into an arranged marriage she tries her best to keep an upper hand by marrying Norton whos a doctor, head over heels for Watts and really her only way out. Norton hopes that Watts will one day come to love him even though hes boring, so we soon follow Watts into an affair with a married playboy. Norton is aware of the affair and gives her two choices, to divorce him for her lover or travel with him to China (where theres been an epidemic). The entire time, Norton carries himself very respectfully and amicably toward Watts despite her complete disregard for his feelings. While in China, we see both Watts and Norton grow individually and together into what becomes quite the unexpected romantic and self-sacrificing drama.
My opinion: The acting is diverse and pulls on many relatable emotional strings, despite being set in the 1920s. We come to love and admire both Watts and Norton and even more so together by the end of the film. The plot, dialogue and cinematography are all beautifully done and enchanting.

The movie, in execution, however, falls short.  I felt that Edward Norton was wooden; Naomi Watts was only slightly better.  The best thing about the movie was the scenery/cinematography and the supporting cast.",1384128000,,375,5.2

3376587,4,B001589S0E,This was a good movie.  It's a romantic movie set some time ago in China when Cholera was still a problem.  Edward Norton takes his wife to a remote town in China whoes doctor has died in order to try to fight off an epidemic.,1383696000,,226,4.0

I have watched it several times and still think I have not fully understood all the different layers of Naomi Watts's character and especially Edward Norton's character.  There is a lot more to each of them then at first meets the eye.

There are a lot of reviews on here that go through the story pretty well and I don't like to spoil it for anyone so I'll just say that the movie has a lot to offer on emotional needs of people in their positions and how they both react to their marriage.  Naomi Watts and Edward Norton pulled off their characters beautifully and make it all very believable and well worth the time to watch.  The scenery is also spectacular.",1383609600,,761,4.4855072463768115

3376596,5,B001589S0E,"The essence of the virtue of forgiveness resulting in the reality that love can be developed and renewed is one lesson this film gives to those who may have taken the marriage vows for granted.  The portrayal of a married man whose selfish desire for gratifying himself by making women fall for him, crushing the woman's heart with his fake promises is a common phenomenon that is hard to comprehend.  The contrast of the sadness versus the happiness of the ending makes the viewer sigh with awe and jerking tears.

As a man, I believe all men should give this movie a watch if you are at all interested in the opposite sex. The reality is, women are people too. The same way we love beauty, women love strength. We are all superficial at the end of the day, and should not rely on another person for your happiness or purpose. Edward Norton is in it, so everyone should watch it regardless.",1382918400,,445,4.309523809523809

Not quite a 5 star experience for me though.",1382400000,,398,4.642857142857143

Stay with it, even though at first the actors (especially Naomi Watts) might seem anachronistically contemporary, miscast . . They each work masterfully: they open their characters slowly, exposing layer after layer, and by the end each reveal fully rounded, suffering, loving, dignified people.

3376636,4,B001589S0E,I almost didn't' watch this movie. It started out like another dry English movie. A simple story with complex relationships. I have some issues on how the Chinese were treated in this movie but you have to consider the times. It's a testament to my philosophy that we learn the most about ourselves from our relationships.,1382140800,,322,4.767857142857143

Everything about this film captured the essence of Maugm's...and his revelations about the idiosyncrasies of human nature. Edward Norton's acting as the inexpressive Englishman was superb, this is one of his finest acting roles in my opinion portraying both the taciturn and yet emotionally torn husband . The rest of the cast including Naomi Watts was solid and faultless,  the musical score was enchanting lending an ethereal quality woven throughout the film and the script was deft and sharp.

I appreciated that it was not all about sex or violence, but there was a story to it..a plot and the characters had real character.

The music alone is inspiring and very spiritual. I have seen this video several times and it never disappoints as Amazon never disappoints in having top of the line movie choices.

Wow, were my expectations of this movie off base. This is a very well done, surprisingly gripping, medically-oriented drama set in the primitive Chinese ""outback"" in the mid 1920's. Mostly English with just enough tastefully selective subtitling of Chinese to keep things understandable, and a gripping story line dealing with an epic life or death battle against Cholera.

3376732,5,B001589S0E,"This is a wonderful story of how hardships can change us for the good, if we choose to let them. My understanding is that this has very little to do with the book, so the writing is really good and Edward Norton contributed to that. I love period pieces, and the cinematography was breathtaking, I wish I had seen it in the theatre. Naomi and Edward were excellent in their roles. Toby Jones is a favorite of mine, as I tend to watch more British productions than anything. This is very realistic, if you are squeamish about symptoms of illnesses, you are forewarned, but suck it up and watch this, it's definitely worth it.",1379721600,,624,4.482456140350878

The acting is impeccable and the characters are so humanized that it is possible to relate to their situation.

I absolutely love this movie and can honestly say that Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are among my favorite actors/actresses.

3376759,5,B001589S0E,"The movie threatened at first to be one of those foreign films that has potential for greatness but the storyline gets diluted in the artsy takes and slow progression. However, it was NOT one of those films, and I was pleasantly surprised about how Naomi Watts, someone I've never had much opinion of either way, portrayed her character's half of this sad and moving relationship in which she marries Walter (Norton, always so good) when she does not love him. The dynamics shift from shy and respectful to tense and angry. Norton, while half the film he barely speaks, does a great job because we see how kind a man he is, but also how hurt. The whole thing was so good, but I was sad with the ending. Hard to get into details without spoiling it. I would watch it again for sure. A little too depressing to own it though. It reminds me of The Piano, only as far as the speed of the movie and melancholy feel.",1378684800,,910,4.358823529411764

3376768,5,B001589S0E,This was a stunningly well done movie by two truly insightful and soul baring talents in Naomi Watts and Edward Norton!!! The contrast between a shallow lusting love and the depth of getting to know a person's soul and learning to love them despite their imperfections was breathtaking. So amazing to watch them fall in love despite the tremendous pain. It truly reaffirmed that love such as this is possible!!! The scenery is spectacular and the supporting ensemble was every bit as talented as the two leads. It has become one of my most loved movies!! Better have a box of tissues......or two!!!!,1378425600,,599,4.825242718446602

3376775,5,B001589S0E,"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well....",1377907200,,1529,4.444444444444445
3376776,5,B001589S0E,"Naomi Watts and Edward Norton couldn't have played their roles any better and they also produced it.  They looked just the way they were described in the book.  They are both wonderful actors.  Somerset Maugham is an exceptional story teller.  It was a beautiful, touching love story about a spoiled immature woman who grew into a selfless, loving person.  One of the best movies I have ever seen.

After watching it the first time i couldn't get it out of my head, it is not often a movie like this comes along. In this movie you learn how things can change between two people, when at first you look at someone and you don't see the inner beauty and dismiss them, how taking a second look can change everything between you and them. It also shows that even after trust is broken it can be regained. There is also the lesson in there that if you are judging someone solely on the way the look and talk you may find that your eyes, and ears have deceived you.

Performances so nuanced, so utterly real and compassionate; this is a spectacular classic that can never and will never fade into irrelavence.  Naomi is in a league all her own and of course nails the complexity and simplicity of her character, making us both despise and adore her.  What's most stunning is Edward Norton's evolving persona, the layers he's able to peel away for all to see, his frailties, his stubborness, his human goodness and human rage; absolutely the finest performance of his career.  The story is set in breathtaking China, but it could have occurred in anyone's hometown anywhere in the world.  China's stunning landscape and its people tell their own beautiful, painful and harrowing history right along with our main characters.  I honestly believe w.

The photography of China is spellbinding as it is compelling, illustrating the peaks and low places of human misery and joy (not happiness, mind you, but joy). Costuming is low key, not distracting from the real business of character study.

I just couldn't stop watching, and when I thought I knew how it would turn out, surprise ending!  I just love movies that surprise me even though i didn't want this ending.

This is a thinking person's movie about marriage and, sadly, will not be appreciated by many. However, the growth of the characters within the arc of the story shows how respect, appreciation, and effort are required to make a marriage work. It doesn't just ""end up"" happy. Things change and you have to navigate through difficulties. The progress and solution for the curing of the cholera seems to me to be the metaphor for healing the diseased marriage between the main characters, Walter and Kitty - brilliantly played by Edward Norton and Naomi Watts. Gorgeous photography with challenging lighting techniques at every turn. Appropriately unusual film score.

Fat chance! Every time I tried to focus on anything else, I found myself drawn back into this film, as scene after scene kept grabbing my full attention, leaving none to spare for chores and such.

I really like Edward Norton, but I was not expecting much from this movie and was quite surprised at how this slow-paced drama managed to keep my attention so fully as the tale unfolded.

She was very selfish and uncaring when she accepted his proposal and was was not in love with him. She takes advantage of him at a time when her circumstances are less then desirable.

Liev Schreiber played a cur so I can't say warm things about him, though he was pretty good as a cur.  The film was a total surprise as I don't remember it from 2007 and wondered why.  I just read a review that indicated it was passed over because it was a downer, focusing on the sin, malaria, and death.  But he missed the beauty of Somerset Maughams story which I loved for demonstrating the power of personal growth and forgiveness rising above human frailty.

The music is haunting and well suited for the movie.  In fact it is the outstanding part.  The story is of the maturing of a rather shallow young woman into a giving and thoughtful person.  The cholera epidemic of the 1920's in China is the focus.  The old ways giving way under modern science.  The turmoil of the Nationalist movement and its fight against foreign influence, perhaps to its own detriment in some aspects.  China's landscapes are different and very beautiful.  The cinematography award winning if I were giving out the awards.  Rembrandt lighting effect is certainly felt as the woman, having been very much at odds with her partner, openly expresses her new found love and respect for him.  The rest is  a story of personal tragedy and triumph.",1362355200,,896,4.764705882352941

I bought a new copy on DVD that must have been bootlegged or something.  It was terrible.  Since this is such a lush gorgeous movie, I felt it deserved the high price tag (for Americans anyway) for the Blu-Ray.  It did not disappoint.  Very good HD transfer overall.  If you really like this movie, I recommend shelling out for the this Blu-Ray.  If you haven't seen it yet, watch it on DVD first.",1360886400,,517,4.214285714285714
3376967,3,B001589S0E,"The film adaptation of the novel The Painted Veil starts off playing things pretty close to the novel, but then veers off in a rather unfortunate manner for my liking. Instead of continuing the story, there are deviations that at first seem unnecessary and then go way off the grid into full-blown distortions.

I realize that a movie that comes from a novel should be judged on its own merit. However, once you have read the book the movie is based on (and please spare me the semantic lesson), you feel compelled to compare. Comparing doesn't mean negation of one or the other. It only means that I see the pros and cons of both. Moreover, saying that one should ignore the source material when reviewing a secondary version is like saying one should ignore history lessons when reviewing a historical drama. One could require a critic to allow for a certain amount of artistic freedom, but to state that those freedoms shouldn't be taken into consideration when reviewing the overall product limits the discussion.

The Painted Veil is lovely to look at, a solid drama, and a well-acted. It moves well despite being over two hours in length and a character study, and is a pleasant enough indulgence. The casting in particular was nearly flawless (exception being Liev Schreiber as Charlie Townsend), especially with the subtle yet powerful performances from Norton and Watts.

The problem I have with TPV is that it differs so unnecessarily from the novel. The novel would've made a perfect movie just as it is, yet there were changes made that added subplots, scenes, and dialogue to the characters that run contrary to the way they were written, and more importantly, add nothing but empty contrivances. If one is going to make a movie that calls itself The Painted Veil and acknowledges the source of the characters, setting, and plot, what good does it do to make additions that do more harm to the source than benefit? Were these done to keep potential ADHD audience members awake, or was it done to pacify those who can't see the past as the past? In other words, were changes made to make the characters more appealing to 21st century viewers who might've been confused by the way people acted in the 1920s? Additionally, as one excellent review pointed out, the gist of the book is altered, e.g. Kitty's transformation is rendered as a mere quest for love. What a sad miscalculation on the part of the director/writer/producers.

In the end, I rate the movie about 3.5 stars and wonder how much better it could have been had they not felt the need to paint a bigger smile on the Mona Lisa.",1360713600,,2601,4.722466960352423

The story told of betrayal, understanding, and redemption comes alive as a great movie.  It has the feel of picture that is appreciated and honored.  It has none of the feel of a TV movie or a blockbuster but rather a well crafted and moving movie.  A doctor in the far east and his wife facing marital problems travel to a Chinese city in the grips of a Cholera epidemic.

But if you like history, fine acting, movies that pull you into the environment, excellent story, stunning and thought provoking visuals, then you will love this movie.  You feel the heat and humidity, the dirt and smells, the palpable fear of death by an ugly disease, the tension of impending revolution.  The acting is outstanding, understated yet compelling.  The direction is taut yet languid.  The writing relies on the lost art of good storytelling.  The editing and cinematography are Oscar-caliber.

I love Edward Norton and after watching his interview on inside the actor's studio, I began searching for films that I haven't seen.  I had this in my watchlist and kept passing over it, thinking it was one of those ""classic, romantic and predictably unsatisfying"" love tragedies.  I am so happy that I decided to watch it.  It goes at a certain pace that I believe any other cast could not pull off.  Norton's character surprised me as he transformed from the starry eyed boy in love, to the betrayed bitter and downright cold shell of a man.  Over the two hours, he continued to surprise however, just when you think this guy is a total Bast*&^, he surprises you and carries you along on this emotional journey.  His wife, just as compelling of a character did the same.  You feel a certain distain and joy and tenderness throughout the movie for both of them, however polarized until the last half hour.

As I hate predicability, I I said to myself, this is going to end tragically as I was drawn in as though part of the story.  I will say, the ending, was not what I had expected and though tragic, very satisfying at the same time.

3377027,5,B001589S0E,"So many movies nowadays focuses simply on lust and the brokenness in relationships with no direction and sometimes simply feed what's wrong with the modern view of love.  This movie focuses on the beauty of a relationship that wasn't perfect but was redeemed and ultimately saw real love.  In modern times, this couple would have simply divorced and been another contributor to the sad marriage statistic.  But set in the early 1900s, it brings you back to a time when adultery in marriage and divorce were not the casual affairs they are today.

Whenever I read books or watch movies of times past, even something like ""Pride and Prejudice"", it's a constant reminder that in the past people married quicker without the long drawn out dating process but somehow marriages lasted longer because it wasn't socially acceptable to simply divorce or leave your spouse. People were ""forced"" into commitment.  Our society cares so much about freedom that we forgot about commitment in a marriage to a person who isn't perfect and never will be but the relationship is worth fighting for because it can be beautiful in the end.",1351209600,,1119,4.8994708994708995

It's a beautiful story in a beautiful place. The scenery is amazing. Edward Norton is amazing.

Edward Norton and Naomi Watts deliver heartfelt, sensitive and realistic performances. The supporting cast is excellent as each character reveals various facets of their personalities along the way. I think this film captures the essence of W. Somerset Maugham's writing by showing people in relationships who experience love, hate, sadness, happiness and the frailties of human existence.

I love the combination of disparity, betrayal,revenge,compassion,forgiveness and redemption. I must say that I love the ""happily-ever-after"" stories, and if you're looking for that, I would still recommend you to watch this movie.

This movie was extremely well acted, the scenery was beautiful, and the dialogue smart.  I would watch this movie again and maybe even buy it, but I'm not sure this is an uplifting kind of film. However, it does make you feel good and think.  I would not say it is depressing, just not necessarily the traditional Hollywood-type ending some people might root for.

Before I watched this movie, I made the mistake of actually reading too many of these reviews.  I wanted to get a good gist of the movie.  It was nice that there were so many reviews for this film.  It was just sad because a lot of reviews went into great detail about the plot.  It was still interesting to watch this movie, even though the reviews kind of told me what would happen. However, if you have not read the synopsis, I would say just try watching the film for the first 5 minutes.  If you like the tone of the movie, it only gets better from there!

Naomi Watts does some really excellent acting here!  She plays a very believe-able Kitty.  I can totally see people I know in her.  Of course, the star is Edward Norton as Walter.  All of the supporting cast add value.  They make a very realistic period piece that has elements of relationships, which transcend into modern day.  This film is very subtle in examining a relationship between a man and woman, a woman and man's journey of self-discovery, and what is really important to people.",1344729600,,1579,4.442508710801394
3377054,3,B001589S0E,"Kitty (played by Naomi Watts) is a relatively attractive and somewhat spoiled girl with pretty much nothing to offer.  Walter (Ed Norton) is a young attractive doctor who specializes in the scientific study of infectious disease.  He is very mild mannered, reserved - not much of a talker.  He meets Kitty at a social function and is smitten. Kitty could take him or leave him - to her, one fellow is very much like another - basically she just wants to dance and go to plays.

Walter has volunteered to go to China and doesn't have time to woo Kitty, he asks her to marry him anyways knowing full well she is not smitten with him. In fact, she hardly knows him.

Kitty is given a rude awakening by her mother when she asks how long Kitty expects her father to continue supporting her. (Basically, we've raised you now get out.) Plus she overhears her mother on the phone talking about plans for her sisters wedding and saying no, she has no such expectations for Kitty the disappointing daughter...  So, in response to her mother's comments Kitty weds Walter and moves to China with him.

Kitty meets Charlie (an acquaintance of her husbands) and they end up having an affair (which is basically boring).  Walter discovers it and gives her an ultimatum - (A) he files for divorce charging her with adultery and naming Charlie as her lover or (B) she accompanies him to a remote area in China where there is a bad cholera outbreak and he is desperately needed (and their lives would be at risk from the disease)  She runs to Charlie and does not get the response she desired and so agrees to go to the cholera area instead of facing the scandal.

For 3/5ths of the movie, Kitty is not someone you feel any sympathy for really... and Walter isn't much better.  But finally in remote China, the struggle of being an unwanted westerner in China and the fight against cholera (and boredom for Kitty) Kitty is forced to grow up, become a better person, a useful person, and the two of them begin to grow close. They come to see each other in a new light and finally find real love.

There is some beautiful landscape footage when they are in remote China. The actress who plays the head of the French convent is wonderful, and their odd neighbor in remote China is also very good in his role. Both likable characters that help enrich the story, but after the first 3/5ths of the movie have gone.  I think a different actress might have been a better Kitty... Ed Norton did well with the somewhat dull role of Walter.

All in all, I guess it was an okay movie (I would imagine the book is much better) - I don't think you'll find this will enrich your life for the watching, but it was ok. My personal recommendation on this is to pass. There are many other entertaining and enriching movies out there.",1344643200,,2796,4.467583497053045

It really stuck with me since watching it a few days ago. The film was so brilliantly executed that I felt like I had personally come to know and care for Walter and Kitty. I have not read the book so I cannot comment on the movie as an adaptation, however I will say I just read the wikipedia article for the novel and I have to say the ending in the book sounds really unsatisfying and kind of horrible. The ending to this film is depressing true enough, but I think I prefer it to the book's story. Otherwise it sounds like it stayed pretty faithful to the original story. Anyway it was a great movie, excellent acting and beautiful story. My only gripe is that I wish there were an alternative version with a happy ending so I wouldn't feel depressed all week :(",1344297600,,891,4.27810650887574

3377061,4,B001589S0E,"If you are a W. Somerset Maugham fan then you may be disappointed because this movie (like many films) veers from some of the finer points of the novel. Having said that, I still found Naomi Watts and Edward Norton's adaptation to be a lovely film. Watts, Norton, and (Naomi's real life mate) Liev Schreiber, all give life to their characters.

Norton's character, Dr. Walter Fane,(a bacteriologist and intelligent but introverted man)falls in love with pretty, pampered, and vapid Kitty, while attending a party at her father's invitation. Dr. Fane is only in London a short time and loses no time in proposing marriage. It is the 1920s so Kitty, who is not particularly intelligent but very charming socially, accepts Walter's proposal - since her marriage options are growing slimmer. After a quick honeymoon, the couple settle down in Shanghai where Walter resumes his work. Kitty is soon bored with her new married life and has a careless affair with another man, Charlie (British Consul played by Schreiber). When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he's so infuriated, he threatens Kitty with divorce on grounds of adultery - which in this era of time could be social suicide. Walter issues an ultimatum; either Charlie agrees to divorce his wife and marry Kitty, or, Kitty will go with him to the inner regions of China to fight an awful Cholera epidemic

Charlie, being the womanizer that he is, wrangles his way out of the picture - declining to divorce his wife and marry Kitty. This is a pivotal point in an awakening of Kitty's self absorption but her character building still has a long way to go! The awkward silence and Walter's disdain of his wife as they travel the backroads to their new destination is painful to watch.

They arrive at their new home; a dismal house on the outskirts of the town and find themselves neighbors to another Brit, The Deputy Comissioner, Waddington, who is stationed there (played to perfection by Toby Jones). Waddington loves his indulgences from fine Scotch Whiskey to coupling with his paramour Wan Xi, a very young and beautiful Chinese woman who has followed him to this post. When Kitty and Walter end up at his home late one night, they all become more candid as the liquor flows and Kitty asks Waddington what Wan Xi sees in him. Waddington asks Wan Xi in Chinese and she replies, ""You're a good man."" When he translates this to Kitty we see her struggle with the young woman's answer as she flippantly replies, ""As if a woman has ever loved a man for his virtue."" But this obviously strikes another chord in Kitty's character as we see her begin to look at Walter differently.

As she finds herself bored and a little frightened in this new and strange place, Kitty begins volunteering her time at the city orphanage. It is run with efficiency and care by the Mother Superior, played with depth and compassion by Diana Rigg. There's a poignant quote by Rigg's character during a conversation with Kitty about marriage as the Nun speaks candidly of her ""husband"" (God), that will strike the heart of anyone in a long term relationship who also has an appreciation for the spiritual aspects of love itself. There's not as much of Kitty's character development in the movie but we still get an understanding of her desire and attempt to become a better person from the frivolous, and self serving young woman she's been most of her life.

Norton does a stellar job in his portrayal of Dr. Walter Fane and as is typical with Norton, his most effective moments are when he's not speaking his lines but in his nuances and mannerisms. He and Watts conjur up a chemistry that is at times mesmerizing. In this film, Walter is more forgiving in the end but it doesn't feel contrived.

Anthony Wong Chau Sang commands our attention as Colonel Yu, who at first, shows an obvious dislike for these intruders from the West, but develops a degree of respect and even appreciation, for Dr. Fane's selfless attempts to save Yu's people from the horrendous disease that is ravaging young and old.

The movie offers breath taking cinematography, authentic sets, and costumes. The story stays fairly true to the ending so have tissues handy, but the tweaking is believable and a tad less dismal than the novel.",1342310400,,4253,4.778231292517007

Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were amazing  and real. They were both somehow unlikable and loveable at the same time. A lot of other reviewers have given a play by play of the movie so I will not do that. This wasn't exactly a love story as much as it was two people finding themselves within each other. I don't know that I would watch it over and over again as it was not exactly uplifting, but it tugged at a heart string in a way that made me feel really truly connected to the story.

3377067,5,B001589S0E,"*This is my first review, so please forgive its imperfections*

I came across this film when scrolling through my video library on a rainy afternoon, and let me just say, if I judged a book strictly by its cover, I would have passed this without a second glance and forgotten it completely. Not that the DVD cover isn't stunning, depicting some enchanting Chinese scenery, but the image of a couple snuggling on a rowboat, I have to admit, had me sighing a little. I remember thinking, Oh God, this is going to be the Chinese version of Australia, a film that shoves some competent cinematography and landscape shots down your throat to distract from an eye-rollingly corny love story.

Again, if I was sold on appearences alone, I would have left this film in the dirt, but being a woman and having my weaknesses, I decided to try it out with the knowledge that Edward Norton (known for being choosy when taking roles) was the lead. I was prepared for a hackneyed romance told mainly through montages (one of my personal pet peeves) and some overdramatic music. I will say, the film DOES open in a somewhat typical fashion. Boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy marries girl, but ahhh, girl doesn't fall for boy. However, the film at this point veers dramatically from where one would expect a movie with said scenerio to head. The wife of Edward Norton's character, played in a wonderful turn by Naomi Watts, is vein, selfish, and unfaithful, but portrayed so as not to make her hateful to the audience. For some actors, this is easier than for others, and Watts shines in creating a beautifully rounded character that transforms from a spoiled daughter of high society to a devoted and powerful wife and woman. I'm going into as much detail as I am because the character development is one of the many great aspects of this film. Each character is written with as much virtue as flaw. No one is perfect, yet no one is unlikeable. Edward Norton is mesmerizing as he has been in every film I have ever seen him in. I truly believe this is one of his most powerful, and sadly underrated, performances. He pulls off a flawless accent and powerfully communicates the resentment he feels for his philandering wife, but what makes the perfomance memorable is how internal most of it is. Norton's eyes play as great a role as his mouth, for there is not a scene in this movie where his tortured betrayal is not evident. He and Watts play off each other with ease, which is ironic because a great chunk of this film has them at each others' throats. The movie boasts an outstanding supporting cast, including Liev Schreiber as the seductive albeit underlyingly slimy lover, Toby Jones (who I have never seen in a role this pivitol since) as the couple's neighbor and sort-of conscience, and the fabulous Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of the French convent. A lot of times in movies, the nun character is employed to offer sentimental words of wisdom, which Rigg does here, but her perfomance keeps the character from being cliche and she easily wins the best line of the film with her speech to Watts' character about faith and how it prevails with the help of love.

As much as I'm raving about the performances, I don't want this film to come across as one only watchable for its actors, because as I discovered within the first ten minutes of this nearly two hour picture, it has so much more to offer. Based on the 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham (which I understand takes a far less romantic turn in its finale than the film version), The Painted Veil tells the story of a shy, young bacteriologist named Walter Fane (Norton), who has returned from his work in China in hopes of taking a wife. He instantly falls for the beautiful but spoiled Kitty (Watts), and abruptly asks her for her hand in marriage. Accepting his proposal(for far less romantic reasons), Kitty is immediately disappointed in Walters' mundane lifestyle and his apparent lack of passion, and wastes no time in seeking it out elsewhere, namely the charming(and married) Charlie Townsend (Schreiber). The lovers are seperated, however, by Walter's discovery, who, as punishment for her behavior, drags Kitty along with him to a small Chinese Village (the name of which is escaping me at the moment) infested with a mammoth outbreak of Cholera. Walter volunteers to be the town's doctor, with the self-pitying Kitty confined to the solitude of their isolated home, her only company the being the non-english-speaking Chinese house-maid and their neighbor, Mr. Waddington, whom she comes to befriend. Walter, his fondness for Kitty now replaced with bitter distain, seeks refuge in his work, but runs into obstacles with the townspeople condemning him as a white imperialist good for nothing but corrupting their tradition. As the film progresses, it is the obstacles faced by the two individuals that bring them to a new understanding of themselves and their realizing that they are both at fault for the marriage's failure through both wanting the other to be something they aren't. The relationship between Walter and Kitty is both complex and beautiful. It undergoes several beatings, but ultimately prevails as one more powerful and romantic than I was prepared for. The love story avoids cliche by taking its time to really manifest itself, and by that I mean it truly had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation for the two characters to finally give in to their feelings. It is something special, as we watch two people, who become more than just characters but emalgums of both human frailty and strength, discover their ability to love. The third act of the film I will not elaborate on because I want everyone to experience it on their own, as well as the rest of a film that has criminally flown under the radar for far too long.

As one who compulsively studies film-making and the factors that determine its greatness, I will wrap up this review by complimenting the stunning production design of the movie. Every shot is strategically framed, pulling no distracting camera cuts like one might see in one of Scorsese's lesser films. And although this film, for me, earns the right to boast some unbelievable shots of the Chinese countryside, at no time does it rely on them to force a reaction. The word to describe this film, in its design atleast, is subtlety. The director, the cinematographer and the production designer let the film speak for itself in how wonderous it is, and Alexandre Desplat lets his score serve as a backdrop rather than a mood-setter. This film is a rare pleasure, and all I can say is I wish there were more out there with as much poise and tenderness as this one possesses. This is a film worth setting time aside to watch, because it is one that demands full attention in order for the viewer to full appreciate what it is trying to do, which is not to wack them over the head with its sentimentality, but rather cradle them with its quiet and tender beauty.",1339891200,,6979,4.7133497133497135

3377075,5,B001589S0E,"For what it's worth, I wish the film could live up to my designation of it, that being: ""instant classic."" I found the film to be a rich and rewarding experience, in that it demonstrated--and quite efficiently--redemptive love and forgiveness--and this after extreme betrayal was effected within the bonds of marriage. Without giving too much of the plot away (for those who haven't read the novel by W. Somerset Maugham) the film opens in 1920s China, in a rural province--the movie was filmed on location, thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers, who took it upon themselves to jump through various hoops to obtain all of the permits necessary to film in the country (a feat not achieved for an American-funded film in many years, as far as I know). A seemingly unhappy couple fills the first few frames, and we immediately get their back-story.

Dr. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is enamored with Kitty (Naomi Watts), the daughter of an affluent family, by all appearances, who he meets at a gala. Not much time passes before he asks the young beauty to marry him and return with him to Shanghai, where he holds a civil position as a scientist. Kitty is taken aback by his sudden boldness and is initially reluctant, until she overhears a telephone conversation her mother has with a friend, wherein she says--regarding Kitty's marriage prospects--""Oh, I gave up on Kitty long ago."" To escape the clutches of her overbearing mother, Kitty sets off to Shanghai with her new husband, but as blissful as the marriage seems in the beginning, things immediately go wrong.

For reasons I will not divulge, the nave Kitty is forced to travel with her husband to a remote region of China, where he has decided to volunteer his services in the fight against a cholera outbreak, as the disease has wreaked havoc and devastation on this part of the country. It is here that the film explores the deepest aspects of the two lead characters, and it is here that the healing process begins. We learn, along with the unhappy couple, that they were expecting things of each other that neither of them possessed in the first place; and each desired something in the other that that person couldn't supply. But eventually, the two learn to accept each other for who they are; and the connection between them soon becomes solid, and unmistakable. I should say that there is one crucial plot point--which carries us into the Third Act--that will conveniently upset the calm and keep us riveted until the final moments play out.

The performances are brilliant and highly believable, but this is more of an art house film than anything, so the average moviegoer will be sorely disappointed if he or she is expecting otherwise. The cinematography is breathtaking, and exquisite views of actual mainland China, with its distinctive misty mountain ranges, fill the background of many establishing shots. The set designers decided on various muted earth tones for many of the interior settings, and this causes the viewer to focus on the players moving about in the foreground, but whether this is in keeping with the period or not, I do not know. What I can say is that it works. I only mention this because many films that are set in the Orient tend to be extremely colorful, and this film is not, which is refreshing, as the subject matter and themes do not call for it.",1328918400,,3349,4.780656303972366

When things get rough between them and she cheats on him, he takes her into the very depth of hell where cholera has spread and killed many.

The character development is stunning even in the movie. John Curran, the Director made a masterpiece never to be forgotten. No, it is not a ride with Bond or Underworld. It is soft and wonderful and full of manly anger and womanly wiles. It is a great novel made into an amazing movie.

3377079,2,B001589S0E,"Beautiful filming.  Incredible scenery.  But the transformation that is supposed to happen for the primary characters just doesn't work.  ""The Painted Veil"" is supposed to be a melodramatic realization film, where an infidelitous wife and scorned husband learn love and understanding (i.e. lifting the veil) amidst the harsh, deadly conditions of a cholera epidemic in China.  The problem is, the transformation, while framed adequately amongst suffering, squalor, and isolation is foreign and not believable, and the chemistry between the two (Edward Norton and Naomi Watts) just doesn't exist.  Which isn't to say they acted poorly.  On the contrary, their performances were decent, albeit a bit wooden.  What isn't decent, however, is the script.  Far too much is left hanging or unexplained; the flaws undermine the fine efforts otherwise, and just about everything else is as predictable as getting a wrong order at McDonalds.

3377082,4,B001589S0E,"Several years ago I reviewed a film, Reds, about the torrid love affair between pre-World War I radical journalists John Reed and Louise Bryant where the Russian revolution of 1917 was used a backdrop for much of the story line. I commented then that that approach had the focus in reverse of what was compelling about the film, the love affair small against the backdrop of the great historic event that swept the pair up in its wake. I then stepped back and went on to tip my hat to the right of an artist to use whatever creative license was at hand in order to tell his or her story. Those same sentiments apply here where the film under review, a film based on British author W. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name, The Painted Veil, tells the story of another tortured love affair set against the backdrop of the Chinese revolution of 1925-27. Except here the revolution is even more of a background echo.

Of course the period in question, in the aftermath of the decimation of the flower of British youth of all classes in the devastation of World War I, is the period of the slow decline of the British Empire. That empire however still included a not unimportant outpost in tumultuous China. And the bulk of this story takes place there. And a rather old-fashioned Victorian story it is. A younger daughter of the upper-middle class under pressure to get married (and married properly, but mainly married), played by Naomi Watts, and a British civil servant doctor stationed in that British outpost in Shanghai and in need of a wife, played by Edward Norton, meet in London, get married despite barely knowing each other and leave for China. However , as is plain, this is not a marriage made in heaven, no way. Like many such arrangements it is merely a matter of convenience.

And that mismatch, that inevitable tension, is just the kind of plot line that Maugham was good at in previous efforts of his that I have viewed (and also read) The Razor's Edge and the more famous Of Human Bondage. The pair are trapped in a no man's land so, of course, someone has to stray off the reservation. In this case Ms. Watts has an affair with another British civil servant in order to get out from under. Said British civil servant already is married, very married, and in no mood to get divorced. Such stories clutter all of literature although not all are filled with perfidious civil servants with meal ticket wives as an excuse.

Naturally Mr. Norton stumbles onto the affair, ruefully offers a divorce under conditions that cannot be met, and so the unhappy couple are held together by some unholy glue as they are off to the outback in order to stem a cholera epidemic. And here is where Maugham's plot line shines. Through a very tortured set of ups and downs they actually come to under stand and love each other, although in the end it is only for one bright moment. Thus Maugham is forgiven, just this minute, for back-dropping the Chinese revolution. This is strictly an old-fashioned love story that may not appeal to the more modern sensibility, but it should.",1318636800,,3080,4.60655737704918

3377091,5,B001589S0E,"The movie, The Painted Veil, is one of those rare instances where the film is more satisfying than the book. Since the book was written by one of our greatest English writers, Somerset Maugham, this is high praise for the film, indeed. Naomi Watts plays Kitty, a spoiled, beautiful English woman who marries a man she does not love, Walter Fane(played by Edward Norton). She has an affair at the first opportunity. Walter finds out and devises a particularly wicked revenge. How his revenge plays out is the main plot of the film.  The book follows a similar story line but the characters of Kitty and Walter are essentially unchanging, and their relationship is basically static as well. In the movie, Kitty, Walter, and their relationship evolve in a surprising, rewarding, and entirely believable manner. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are excellent as Kitty and Walter, and Toby Jones, Diana Riggs, and Liev Schrieber are a fine supporting cast. The movie also has beautiful scenery (filmed on location in China) and a haunting score. Highly recommended.",1292889600,,1057,5.005681818181818
3377092,5,B001589S0E,"This movie is so good!  I'm in medical school and I want to do international health and this movie inspires me.  It's about this doctor who goes to work in a village in China that is experiencing an outbreak of cholera.  It's also about his marriage and some minor drama there but it ends well.  I enjoyed it a lot and I think edward norton and naomi watts are great great actors.  Throughout the movie is a love story between the two (they're married) and it shows how through their marriage, their love grew.  Recommended if you like love and movies a little bit different than your avg romantic comedy or super hero film.",1292198400,,624,4.4298245614035086
3377093,5,B001589S0E,"This is a wonderful story about love, betrayal and forgiveness. The outdoor scenes of the country are gorgeous. Definitely worth buying.",1290470400,,136,5.523809523809524
3377094,5,B001589S0E,"There was a version of this movie in the 50s called The Seventh Sin starring Eleanor Parker. I happened to catch it on TCM a couple months ago, and thought the plot summary looked familiar. I had seen TPV first, but The Seventh Sin was great as well. Naomi and Ed had wonderful chemistry as the estranged couple. Movies are always more believable when the actors have a connection. Lieb was great in his scenes also. The storyline flowed well and you really felt for the characters and their situation, and you couldn't help but root for them. By the end, I cried.

Not going to rehash the story, but I do recommend it. Don't miss this one, and if you can check out The 7th Sin, watch that as well.

Great job!",1283385600,,710,4.330827067669173
3377095,5,B001589S0E,"Loved this. The cast is great, the scenery is beautiful, and the ending broke my heart. I've read it's not accurate to the book, but it's really a wonderful film. There is so much cr*p out there now, seeing this is really special.",1277251200,,230,4.372093023255814

3377097,5,B001589S0E,"What a beautiful movie! Naomi Watts delivers a great performance in her role of the spoiled young lady who steps into marriage for the wrong reasons, thus paving the way to adultery.  And Edward Norton, totally surprised me with his incredibly mature and powerful portrayal of Dr. Walter Fane. He has always been a specially gifted actor, but in this movie he displays a totally new quality to his acting. That of an incredibly attractive and totally believable leading man. He totally blew my mind away just as Ralph Fiennes did in The English Patient. China in the early 1920's provides the perfect background for such a wonderful story to unfold. And although I certainly believe that the movie is a little weak in terms of portraying the sociopolitical turmoil taking place in China in the 1920's it is undeniable that ""The Painted Veil"" has all the elements of an epic love story, a total Oscar material.
I cannot help but wonder why this wonderful movie came so unnoticed to the Academy...",1274832000,,995,4.784883720930233
3377098,5,B001589S0E,"To be honest, the cover intrigued me when I spotted this movie at my local library. I took it home and it sat on my dresser for a week or so before I finally watched it. Several days later, the movie still resonates in me.

THE PAINTED VEIL is one of those stories that takes you slowly along for the journey. But that is not too say it is without context. There are many gentle, yet powerful messages woven throughout. One is set upon this emotional string of liking, then disliking, and then really feeling for the characters.

This is one of those ""you don't want to miss"" movies. If it is in book form, I would have loved to have read it for I have no doubt that if I had, it would have been one of those powerful, forget-me-not books.

THE PAINTED VEIL is not just a great movie, it's a great story that one would be wise to take note of the life lessons taught.",1274745600,,867,4.148809523809524
3377099,5,B001589S0E,"Just watched the Painted Veil.  What a fantastic quality movie.  Excellent in every way, great plot, gorgeous scenery and captivating story.  I cannot believe this has not been put out on Blu Ray yet.  They send out crap like Transformers on Blue Ray but something as great as this remains in regular DVD. Shame on the powers that be that insult our intelligence by not releasing such great movies for Blu Ray.  T'is a testament at the low IQ they attribute to the general populace.  Not sure if to blame the people for stiring the execs in this direction or the execs for thinking so lowly of us.

A definite watch for all of you should you get the chance.",1270080000,,657,4.425
3377100,4,B001589S0E,"I would give this movie a 4.5 and believe the story is worth everyone, young and old, having in their life experience section of their brain.  But I had to take off a star for Edward Norton's haircut in the last 20 minutes of the film.  All of a sudden, his hair was highlighted blonde and was styled excessively in early 90's form - totally out of place and inexcusable.  I am still looking for that lengendary stylist from China in the late 1920's! [Buy it just for the haircut].  Also, the imagery is pretty awesome - might be nice on BlueRay - some of the images were pixelated on DVD (even opening title text) on my upconverting DVD player.",1267833600,,645,4.35
3377101,5,B001589S0E,"This movie has so many excellences. The cinematography and score are wonderful, and the performances of all the actors are so true to life. Not just the main characters but all the minor ones give stellar performances -- from the scornful Chinese officer who barely tolerate the imperial westerners in his country to Waddington, the dissipated but dedicated counsul, to the luminous Mother Superior and her charming nuns.  Even bit characters, such as the nameless servant who runs to fetch Waddington when Kitty can't deal with her packing up Walter's things, or the Manchu lover of Waddington turn in memorable performances.

Kitty and Walter are perfect in their portrayal of the bloodless husband concealing deep passions, and the shallow girl who married for escape and ultimately finds love.  Particularly memorable is how the movie portrays the fine line that can exist between love and hatred.

While the movie is slow, and a little predictable, the time that the book was written in demands this kind of slowness, and it lends the movie even more poignancy. Those who don't like classic literature or need a lot of action in their entertainment probably won't like this movie, but for those of us who like classic literature and historical movies the deliberate building up of the pace adds rather than detracts from the movie.  Particularly moving is the A la Clare Fontaine sequence, as Kitty leaves China.

I would have liked some extras on the DVD, but I suppose we can't have everything.

I seem drawn to this movie whenever I see it is on the schedule, (and it seems to be showing up on pay movie channels quite a bit). I've probably watched it a half dozen times, quite involuntarily, and the more I see it the more impressed I have become with it.  This is definately worth a watch, and in my opinion, a purchase.",1266710400,,1830,4.805732484076433

3377103,4,B001589S0E,"I had never heard of this movie when I came across it as a recommended item.  I bought it, watched it and loved it.  It is a haunting love story, completely unconventional and surprisingly deep.  It eloquently blends forgiveness, faith and love in a story that is not easily forgotten.  Simply wonderful.",1266192000,,304,4.788461538461538
3377104,5,B001589S0E,"This movie is about a love story set in the 1920s that tells the story of a young English couple, Walter, a middle class doctor and Kitty, an upper-class woman, who get married for the wrong reasons and relocate to Shanghai, where she falls in love with someone else. When he uncovers her infidelity, in an act of vengeance, he accepts a job in a remote village in China ravaged by a deadly epidemic, and takes her along. Their journey brings meaning to their relationship and gives them purpose in one of the most remote and beautiful places on earth. The Painted Veil is an intelligently adapted, well-directed movie with two charismatic lead performances and a strong supporting cast, including Liev Schreiber, Diana Rigg, and Toby Jones as the Fanes' neighbor. Entertaining, and a good introduction to the period piece/historical epic.",1265846400,,839,4.957446808510638

3377107,4,B001589S0E,"This period piece is very enjoyable indeed with its Chopin-like music and its gorgeous scenes of China. And, like all good drama, the characthers grow and develop - in this case, a marriage which starts off without love (at least on the wife's side)and indeed nearly founders because of the wife's adultery begins to grow as each begins to see the other in his/her true light - they grow as persons and enter into true love for each other.  All this is set against the backdrop of political tensions and, of course, cholera, which begins to shape their lives.  A beautiful movie, which I am sure will linger in the memory.",1262304000,,622,4.594594594594595

3377109,5,B001589S0E,"The melding of story, presentation by the Actors, all set in front of perfectly designed backgrounds (visuals) has made this film a regular re-watch on my personal favorites list.  Not since the melodramas of the 40's has a film been able to pull me into the actual production.  The Painted Veil was the emotional experience I usually have while reading a book, rather than watching a movie.

Excellent in every respect...",1254096000,,422,4.915492957746479
3377110,5,B001589S0E,"This is an absolutely stunning and beautiful movie. Just watched it on a premium channel and went straight to Amazon to buy it. Outstanding cast (Ed Norton should have received an Oscar), beautiful scenery, great music and a heart breaking love story. I wish they would make more movies like this one!",1252454400,,301,4.8076923076923075
3377111,3,B001589S0E,"Take your spouse into a cholera epidemic.  That seems to be part of the message of The Painted Veil, where egocentrics turn noble in the face of a scourge and British ingenuity gets fresh water back into town.  If that all sounds a little Empire-ish and 20's-ish, so be it.  Maugham wrote the novel, after all, in 1925.  And if the characters are mostly walking cardboard, some very good actors give them a dash of life, including Naomi Watts as Kitty, Diana Rigg as Mother Superior, and -- especially -- Toby Jones as Waddington.  The on location settings are beautiful, and the film works nicely as a travelogue for journeys to the Chinese interior, assuming that epidemic has stayed quelled.  I watched The Painted Veil, enjoyed it, and found not one thing in it that will last in memory beyond tomorrow morning.  It did, in short, what some movies set out to do -- entertain.  And sometimes that's enough.",1243036800,,909,4.672955974842767
3377112,4,B001589S0E,"Amazing performances by Watts and Norton, but the winner here is China itself, with the most amazing scenery, atmosphere, and resilence, as life goes on despite the epidemic.

Kitty as a heroine is flawed and selfish, Walter rigid and hurt, and brittle in his anger. The lover seems all she could want and more, until she realizes Walter is capable of love, whereas her 'lover' is not.

I wish they had had more time before the bitter ending, but other than that, it was a lovely if dark film.",1241740800,,493,4.52808988764045
3377113,4,B001589S0E,"The enormous challenge to make us to forget to Greta Garbo was done through this sophisticated and mature emotional situation around an unsatisfied woman and his bore husband who just thinks about himself and his absorbing work. His young, adorable and refined wife is seduced trying to find her life another sense. But the proposed solution to get away from this explosive situation will lead both to understand the meaning if this feeling in the middle of the hell.

Naomi Watts proves she may carry on her shoulders the most demanding and exigent dramatic roles you want. Her expressive gestures, body language and suggestive gaze really catapulted her in this so many times told portrait of adultery and not confessed passions behind close doors.

Watch it. It will not disappoint you.",1240358400,,789,5.015267175572519
3377114,4,B001589S0E,"Everything about the movie was great apart from the last section. It is almost as if they suddenly looked around and thought, oh dear, film's too long. I would have liked to have seen them 'in love' a little bit more before the denouement.

Having said that, the first part of the film meanders like a slow river, with most of the action in flashback. So perhaps an evening out of the two might have worked.

They really manage to capture the heat and conditions of the times, and Naomi Watts, while playing a selfish byotch of a character, really transforms in the course of the film in a believable manner. And as a result, he transforms in our eyes.

Diana Rigg is great too as a catalyst for them both. And the ending was pitch perfect. I ended up really feeling for all the characters in this tense, chilling, but ultimately heartwarming movie.",1240185600,,849,4.5
3377115,5,B001589S0E,"I absolutely adore this film. I have watched for the third time and still, I could view it again. It is so beautiful; a true story, so real and timeless.

What is love?

What moves us to become better human beings?

It amazes me how touching this story is. Here is this couple, a shallow, selfish, young woman and an idealistic, ambitious doctor, venturing forth to a strange new life in an equally strange world: Imperialist China circa the early 1900's. We watch the Naomi Watts character grow from god-awful, self-centered brat into a whole and remarkably mature woman. The beauty of the surroundings, the  subtle references to English Empire in its last phases, the curious neighbor played superbly by Toby Jones. And let's not forget the amazing, Edward Norton. So, so, well-acted, with a top-rated cast (the marvelous Diana Rigg).

If you haven't had the experience of seeing this film, I envy you!",1238976000,,904,4.8441558441558445
3377116,5,B001589S0E,"What a gorgeous movie -- the writing, the cinematogrophy, the score.  Watts, whose mother makes no bones about her desire for Watts to marry and leave home, does exactly this when she weds a man she does not love, awkward bacteriologist (Norton), and moves to Shanghai with him for his job.  While there, she meets charming, married womanizer (Schreiber) and the two begin an affair.  When Norton discovers this, he gives her an ultimatum: come with me into a cholera epidemic, or I will divorce you.  With no alternative, Watts follows him into a beautiful devastation; terribly sick and dying populace with a backdrop of gorgeous natural beauty.  In their time together, they discover things about themselves and one another that they weren't aware of at the start, and you slowly begin to care about characters that are generally unlikeable, or whom you felt indifferent towards, when you first met them.  Some reviewers found the movie predictable, but the ending could easily have been reversed, with a seperate set of emotional consequences that are interesting to ponder.  This movie left me thinking for days.  Based on a book by W. Somerset Maugham (who wrote the epic Of Human Bondage) and brilliantly acted by Watts and Norton -- who is always good and especially excellent in this adaptation -- this movie definitely has a lot going for it and is worth watching.  I wouldn't describe this as a romantic movie even though it is a love story, and my husband (Godfather-loving sports fanatic whose favorite movie is A Clockwork Orange and who had planned to fall asleep within the first ten minutes of viewing) enjoyed it very much as well, so men . . . don't judge this one by its cover.  Give it a try.",1235952000,,1713,4.776271186440678
3377117,4,B001589S0E,"Ed Norton and Naomi Watts both produced and starred in this 2006 adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel - it's clear from the vibrant opening shots set in a gorgeous Chinese valley that this is a labor of love for these two actors.

And indeed, ""labor of love"" is the prime theme of this film.  For while there is undeniably a love story at its root, but in this world, love must be fought for tooth and nail.  There are no breezy romances here.

Watts plays Kitty, a spoiled British spinster living under the crushing thumb of her mother.  Norton plays Walter, a bacteriologist who is more comfortable with a microscope than humans, but nevertheless has fallen for Kitty.  Following one of the oddest marriage proposals ever, Kitty and Walter head to Shang-hai, where Walter leads a colonial laboratory.

Incidentally, ""PV"" proves the old chestnut that England must be the most boring country in the world because no matter what odd corner of the world you find yourself in, there's probably a British doctor or explorer already there, setting up shop.

Bored out of her mind by the limited society of colonial Shang-hai, Kitty has an affair with the local consul, Charlie Townsend (Liev Shreiber, perfectly cast). Walter discovers the infidelity and, perhaps to punish Kitty, forces her to accompany him to the Chinese interior where he must fight an outbreak of cholera.

Here is where the movie really takes off.  Walter and Kitty, full of hatred for each other, nevertheless must keep up appearances in this gorgeous but plagued village.  With the help of the local British colonial advisor (Toby Jones), a French nun (Diana Rigg, awesome!) and the grudging help of the local Chinese commander (Anthony Wong), Walter fights to bring change to this rigid society.  The tranquil village is actually a powderkeg of nationalistic fervor, where the Western logical suggestion to move the cemetery away from the drinking water is greeted with rage rather than relief.

Watts, Norton, Jones, Rigg, Yu, and the rest of the cast throw themselves into this story with abandon - this is an actors' movie.  The script demands that the actors convey meaning with subtext, not the actual words - British and Chinese societies were too strict to allow for much plain speaking.  And in this movie, it works.

But this isn't a Great Film - the arc of the picture is fairly predictable, and one wishes that the movie's one true villain would get more of a comeuppance.  But these are minor quibbles - this is a very good movie and a must-see for any of the Merchant-Ivory fans out there.",1235174400,,2577,4.820454545454545
3377118,5,B001589S0E,"This was the movie that showed me why men who are restrained, non-combative,
stalwart in their love no matter what happens, and devoted to a cause are so attractive. In short, it is when I fell in love with Edward Norton's performance as the cuckolded husband of the beautiful, but shallow, Naomi Watts. Told from her perspective, the movie is worthy of the book. However, the exotic photography of this time and place enhances the story line. Long after the film ended, I found myself thinking about relationships and how they can be revived through the direst of disasters. Not a great date flick, but for those who are married, familiar themes will make it highly relevant and engaging.",1234137600,,689,4.798319327731092

Naomi Watts, Edward Norton and liev Schreiber does deliver very fine performences. The film on the other hand also gives us an outlook of China in the early 20th century. Beautifull locations, good performences makes this film worth a watch. A slow, yet a beautifull film.",1233360000,,404,5.136363636363637

It's a swing back to the golden days of movie making where plot lines & acting was priority rather than looks and special effects, like today. A must see!!!",1233360000,,432,4.345679012345679

The Painted Veil, though not a movie that many people are thinking about today, is nonetheless a lush and beautiful movie which doesn't adhere to formula and tells an interesting love story; enhanced by good performances (especially Toby Jones) and marred only slightly by a tacked-on epilogue, it's a movie worth seeking out.",1233187200,,344,5.142857142857143

3377123,4,B001589S0E,"For those wondering if this slender American whose defining movie is probably ""Fight Club"" also can bring off a period piece set in China requiring him to master a role as an educated Englishman, the answer is mainly ""yes.""

The viewer may not entirely forget that Norton is from Columbia, Md., rather than the UK, but Norton brings the requisite reserved honor and decency to the story as Walter Fane, a cuckolded bacteriologist working to combat cholera and deal with the aftermath of his bored wife's adultery.

""The Painted Veil"" features apparently stock Maugham characters such as the Fanes' neighbor, a shabby British expat who knows the ropes in a lost corner of southern China, and lives with a Chinese woman, whose relationship to her is more complex than it appears on the surface and seems to have more true devotion than the Vane's difficult marriage.

This is the kind of film that may seem a bit formulaic on initial viewing but one that grows in the memory as highly recommendable. Days later I find myself thinking of Fane's slowly revealed honor both as a professional dealing with a region near collapse and dealing with a wife who betrays him but eventually sees her husband's strengths and the validity of emulating his efforts to help others.

China travelers will revel in this beautiful look at the countryside around Guilin, arguably the most beautiful part of China, known for its sharks-tooth limestone mountains famous in classic scroll paintings.",1232064000,,1475,4.959514170040486

It's a high quality production, but perhaps don't expect to be fascinated.",1231718400,,339,4.573770491803279

-It features Edward Norton, one of my favorite actors.
-It features Naomi Watts, one of my favorite actresses.
-The story reminds me a lot of F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of my favorite authors.
-It's about love and cholera, yet it doesn't rip off ""Love in the Time of Cholera""

It's the best kind of love story as you get to watch two people's hearts open up and grow for each other. Naomi Watts is beautiful and Ed Norton is equally handsome and sexy.

3377130,5,B001589S0E,"True Love story fully living up to all my personal expectations of a story in this subject.  Sometimes the only way to deal with the hurt of a betrayal, is to fully put oneself in a suicidal situation in the hopes of dying.  And at that point in the midst of that fiery passion, one can grow in forgiveness wings of an unexpected flight.  Sometimes the confrontation of death, can trail an access point directly to the heart & soul.  Most movies which tried to capture love, always left me shaking my head at the ignorance of at least one scene or another, more often than not of which one disgraceful scene after several others.  However, I'm sure most may not be able to appreciate the beauty in this simple story, but as for me I give it all 5 stars.",1226188800,,753,4.3120567375886525
3377131,5,B001589S0E,"Hollywood just can't leave well enough alone. Way back in 1925 Somerset Maugham wrote a truly forward-thinking feminist story about a vapid woman who comes to realize there's more to life than the empty fun that she's always craved and been led astray by. Ever since, Maugham's ending has been twisted by filmmakers to make it a second-chance-at-love romance. This version even adds a little Chinese political subplot that was entirely absent from the book. So the Chinese background gets modernized, while women are thrown back into love story land in the last reel.  So it goes.

But when a movie is this well put together, who cares?  The screenplay--despite my quibble with the direction the end takes--is very sharp.  The scenery is magnificent, and the acting is stellar.  Naomi Watts captures Kitty Fane's vapidity and makes her not just understandable but sympathetic.  Edward Norton is likewise great as her husband Walter, a man who in his anger at being cheated on decides to take them both on a suicide mission to a cholera-plagued area.  The supporting cast is excellent--especially Toby Jones and Diana Rigg.

The movie holds up to repeated viewings because the performances are so good, and the mood created by the director is mesmerizing.  Music plays a big part in its success.  The selective use of a piano piece by Satie is enhanced by a score that sounds as if Satie had composed the whole thing.  I actually scrambled to find out whether the waltz featured in the score was Satie's--it wasn't.  Just beautiful.

It's sad that movies like this don't meet with more success in the movie theaters.",1225670400,,1615,4.893382352941177

3377134,5,B001589S0E,"This 2006 film is the third movie adaptation of the 1925 novel by Somerset Maugham.  The film brings us back to that time and place where Brits were considered the good guys when they moved to China and tried to help the people.  It brought me right there too, being carried in a sedan chair, feeling the heat and the dust and the basic ""foreignness"" of China for the British characters.

Naomi Watts is cast in the role of a spoiled upper-class young woman who is pressured into marrying Edward Norton, a do-gooder British bacteriologist who lives in Shanghai and is looking for a bride.  He plays the role as a well-meaning, but uptight and stuffy man without an ounce of romantic appeal.  Not surprisingly, his bride is soon having an affair with Liev Schreiber, a businessman and diplomat married to a very socially prominent woman.  When Norton finds out about the affair, he is furious, and, as Liev Schreiber has no intention of leaving his wife, Watts is forced to go with her husband to the interior of China where there is a raging Cholera epidemic.

Against the backdrop of this serious disease which is ravaging the countryside, this marriage is displayed with all its faults.  Watts hates her husband who is doing his best to help the people who don't understand why he denies them their water supply or why he insists that the dead must be buried immediately.  Norton works day and night to help the people, even creating an irrigation system and making peace with the local warlord.  Watts starts to work in an orphanage run by nuns and she begins to soften towards her husband.  Eventually, they fall in love and there seems to be happiness in spite of all the disease around them as well as lots of anti-British feelings.  Then tragedy strikes.

I loved this film. I thought the acting was outstanding.  I felt the reality of the China that Somerset Maugham described in 1925.  And I really related to the story.  This film did not get very good reviews when it came out.  It was thought to be too old fashioned for a modern audience.  To me, however, this film was first rate.",1219968000,,2094,4.598382749326146
3377135,5,B001589S0E,"Breathtaking in its filming of rural China, this movie features two main characters that sear the screen: Naomi Watts and Ed Norton. Watts is ""Kitty Fane"" who has married to escape her mother and to best her sister by ""getting the doctor."" Bored to tears as a housewife, she has an affair with a notorious ""ladies man"" who is also married and she deludes herself that he loves her enough to divorce his wife.

Norton plays Walter, a research doctor who comes home early one day and catches an eyeful. He then makes Kitty a proposition: if her lover agrees to marry her, he will divorce her. If not, she must come with him to a corner of China where an epidemic of Cholera is raging and there is no doctor. Take it or leave it, he says. She takes it - very reluctantly.

Yes, two previously irreconcilable spouses, probably never in love in the first place, somehow find each other as well as a mutual purpose in life,  and should go on to spend a fulfilling life together.

I had this movie sitting on the shelf, kept passing it by to watch others.  Wow, I LOVED this movie!  It was so good, so wonderful.  Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were spectacular!  What took me so long to watch and totally enjoy?  I was INSTANTLY immersed in this movie.

The scenery is breath-taking, the plot great. Set in the 1920's, Watts and Norton, marry -- she to please her parents and to basically get out of their house.  Norton is taken with Watts and is in love with her.  But, ALAS!  He doesn't know how to show his love and he is too deeply involved in his work in the medical field to realize he is shutting his wife out.  She gets involved in an affair with one of their friends.

Norton finds out, and to me, it seemed out of resentment, he takes a job in China to help fight a cholera epidemic.  Wow, how nasty and awful this place is.  While Norton is loving being there, having the medical time of his life, Watts HATES it there.  To make matters worse, Norton is full of resentment and punishes Watts by ignoring her and being mean and nasty.  Watts seems to be slowly going out of her mind, being in a foreign place, full of disease, political uprisings, dangerous situations!

We are taken through this village fighting cholera and the marriage and relationship of Norton and Watts.  Diana Rigg as Mother Superior was wonderful, she is a superb actress.

The movie is a tear-jerker but well worth every kleenex.  The ending is sad and leaves a lesson learned -- don't waste time playing games with those you love.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie, although I am probably one of the last people in the world to just have seen it.  If you are in the small minority of people like me who have not seen this movie, PLEASE check it out.  You will love it.  Watts and Norton are such good actors and the movie is wonderful.

Based on the book by W. Somerset Maugham. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton bring to life a poignant and evolving relationship, between a stern, awkward young doctor and his spoiled bride. A haunting score compliments their understated performances, brilliantly set in south China. Their story unfolds, a story of a faithless bride, caught by her husband and forced to follow him to a cholera outbreak, and ultimately, the restoration of their relationship to a level far deeper than ever before.

The tensions in the air are beautiful, and the development and growth in the characters are refreshing. Excellent score! I just leave the DVD menu running, and listen to that one song over and over. But the Painted Veil would be moving even as a silent film.",1214438400,,899,4.7935483870967746

3377145,5,B001589S0E,The Painted Veil never got the attention it deserves.  The plot is simple but the movie is about the unveiling of 2 people layer by layer.  Much of the praise goes to Watts and Norton for showing the many sides of their characters in a subtle way.  There are no huge crying or screaming scenes.  It is never overacted but the characters remain compelling.  I would have liked to see more about the politics of the Cholera epidemic at the time since it is an interesting event. That is a small criticism though and doesn't diminish the quality of the movie.,1212451200,,556,4.465346534653466
3377146,5,B001589S0E,"Watched this one all impressed by superior acting of the two stars, but really it's hard to imagine why they decided to make this particular story, it's so old fashioned and after awhile you have to ask yourself, are we supposed to admire these British people, their position in China seems anomalous and just plain wrong, I found myself cheering when the Chinese youths decided to menace Naomi Watts and knocked her out of her howdah in the crowded alleys of the town.  Maybe that's mean spirited of me, but then again the film seems to recognize the problems of its raison d'etre on more than one occasion.  Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) comes home all thrilled by the good charitable work Diana Rigg and the other nuns are doing, but Walter (Ed Norton) sets her straight with a grim, they're stealing babies to turn them into Catholics.  You can see that Kitty doesn't think that such a bad idea after all.  Then there's the pre-teen Chinese orphan who refuses to answer to her Western name.  Good for her!  And what about that Chinese attache general or whatever he was, could they have picked someone who looks less Asian?  Love to see an Eastern telling of THE PAINTED VEIL, I guess the Ron Howard movie of a few years back, GUNG HO, would be the nearest equivalent.

But whatever qualms I have about the movie, Watts and Norton are fantastic, and in Norton's marvelous nude scene there's one trick I never thought I'd see captured on film.  He's waking up having made love to his wife after many years of treating her coldly, and he's trying to sneak out of her bedroom without waking her, and we see him retreating away from the camera and then Watts speaks, startling him to such a degree we see him freeze and yet his buttocks quiver, delicately, magnificently.  Was this CGI or just more of that Oscar worthy Norton total command of the body?  Whatever it is, he should do it in every movie and perhaps on one of those old fashioned whistle-stop trains that used to bring politicans to every city in the nation, and he could step out on a bunting-lined caboose at every stop and show the folks what fine acting is really all about.",1212278400,,2137,4.5390625

3377148,5,B001589S0E,"This amazing film is based on the Somerset Maugham novel of the same name. (And, being based on Maugham, you know this ain't gonna end well, right?) Set in the 1920s, The Painted Veil tells the story of Kitty (Watts), a beautiful young woman who, as our story begins, is yet unmarried. Just as Kitty is feeling increasing pressure from her family to wed, Walter Fane (Norton) walks into her life. Fane is a brilliant, quiet bacteriologist who is currently working in Shanghai. Fane is quickly infatuated with Kitty, and he promptly asks her to marry him. Kitty agrees (due to a variety of reasons), and the two are wed and travel to China together.

Once in China, however, the couple's differences sharpen. Kitty finds comfort in the arms of a lover, and when Walter discovers her transgression, he confronts her. Walter's terms are simple: 1.) He can divorce her publicly for adultery, ruining her reputation; 2.) She can join him in a small Chinese village where he has agreed to serve as a doctor. (The village is battling an awful cholera epidemic.)

Kitty finds herself traveling to the Chinese countryside with her husband. The stench of adultery hangs palpably between them, and the two seem to despise each other. However, over time, Kitty and Walter begin to rediscover themselves and each other, leading to a conclusion that is redemptive and (in some ways) affirmative of the capacity of the human spirit.

This is an amazing, character-driven film. Performances by Watts and Norton, which make up the bulk of the screen-time, are unbelievable. Kitty is initially rendered as a slightly shallow woman who really doesn't know herself. She has not concerned herself with anything that is not about her. She chooses to marry Walter because she wants to get away from her mother and because she's beginnig to feel it necessary to marry SOMEONE to satisfy her family. However, as the film continues, Kitty grows up. She begins to think of the world outside of herself. She begins to yearn for a useful life.

Walter, a serious scientist, is not a social person. But he sees Kitty and is drawn to her. His need to be back in China is pressing, so he rushes an awkward courtship and proposes. There is much more to Walter, however, than Norton initially lets us see. His intelligence, his astute conclusions about human nature, his capacity for vengeance, his capacity for forgiveness. There are no flat characters here. These are intriguing, real, flawed people, and they are fascinating to watch.

Panoramic shots of the varied landscape of China are beautifully done, and the costumes are wonderful. The real show, though, is the evolving relationship between Kitty and Walter.

3377151,5,B001589S0E,"There are some films that are so good, that I hesitate to review them since any review would come short in conveying the exceptional quality of the production. The Painted Veil is this type of film. It just could not be better. The acting is superb.  The Chinese scenery and settings, the costumes (especially for Naomi Watts), and the art direction are of the highest quality. The music, often offering us variations of Eric Satie's compositions, complimented the feeling of the remote Chinese countryside. Yet it is the underlying novel by W. Somerset Maugham and the terse screenplay presented here, that is the bedrock upon which this excellent production is built.

The storyline weaves a tale of ever changing relationships and the bonds created, broken, and recreated. Kitty is a spoiled, bored, self-centered yet beautiful young woman who lives with her parents. She is a bit late in selecting a husband and her parents become increasingly biting and pushy in their comments that she should marry. A young infectious disease specialist, Walter Fine, comes to a family party, where he falls for Kitty. Beside beauty and physical grace, she has an off-handed frankness that could be seen as attractive. Walter falls for her and she is casually amused by him. However her mother's overbearing nature eventually helps tip the scales and Kitty marries this shy, bright, but naive young man. Since he is in the public health division of the English civil service, he is soon assigned to Shanghai China and Kitty must go with him. She is soon bored and they find they have little in common. He reads and studies and she plays cards and games. He does his best to amuse her. He is a bit shy in regard to love making, preferring to make love in the dark. The stage is being set for a major problem. The problem arrives with an invitation to the Vice-Consul's home for a dinner party. Here Kitty meets charming Charlie (played well by Liv Schreiber)and soon becomes his lover. Walter comes home unexpectedly and hears them making love behind her locked bedroom door. He leaves a record album he has purchased for her beside the door, a simple message to her that he knows what she has done. Dr. Fine accepts a terrible risky assignment to go deep into the Chinese countryside to deal with a cholera epidemic. He tells Kitty she must come too. She refuses. He then tells her that he will begin divorce proceedings the next day. In 1925 a woman divorced by her husband for adultery would ruin her social and economic status and stability. She is really forced into the situation of going into a disease infested remote area. She tries to get Charlie to divorce his wife and marry her, but he will have none of it and thus Kitty sees that he is a handsome and charming playboy, but has no intention of disrupting the relationship with his rich, sophisticated wife.

Thus Kitty agrees to go with Walter in a bleak pact that has a feeling of mutual destruction. It is in this backwater site of poverty and disease that the husband and wife actually begin to know each other. Walter has come to the conclusion that Kitty is terminally shallow, bored, spoiled, and self absorbed. However a series of events, some tragic, begin to unfold that both allow Kitty to develop beyond her own self-centeredness and to discover within herself some self worth based on service to others.

Toby Jones plays a remote English official who reveals to Kitty the reality of her relationship with Charlie, a superficial tryst and not a life long commitment. Diana Rigg is superb as the French Mother Superior of a Catholic school, hospital, and orphanage, who guides Kitty gently toward self examination, commitment to others rather than to oneself, and eventually to the talents and intellectual compassion of her husband.

Here the themes of the film become almost profound as it explores whether it is possible to fall in love with the underlying goodness of a person.  Kitty gradually begins to appreciate the dedication of her husband to public health and the masses suffering from infectious diseases. However, despite his busy and demanding life, Dr. Fine begins to appreciate Kitty's growing dedication to the French nuns and the work in the orphanage school. As their appreciation for each other grows, tensions between Chinese nationalists and the English also grow and erupt violently. Walter saves Kitty from a band of Chinese ruffians. It is here that Kitty discovers she is two months pregnant and the father is probably Charlie, not Walter.  They have reconciled enough at this point that he accepts this fact and Walter really forgives any and all of Kitty's past indiscretions. Yet at this time his public health strategies have begun to turn the tide on the cholera epidemic and the death rate drops dramatically in the village. Unfortunately good news spreads and the people from a neighboring village also stricken by Cholera invade the village and must be pushed back into a refugee camp. Here Walter works to bring the disease under control but becomes ill himself. Kitty comes to the refugee camp and nurses Walter, but it is impossible to keep him hydrated. He awakens from his coma and calls to her, she is sleeping beside him, and he asks for her forgiveness. At this point we see that he has also grown, for he has moved from the victimized husband with the unfaithful wife to a realization that he has pulled them both into a suicide mission and he has assumed he can punish her for the pain she caused him. It is now Walter than needs forgiveness. The film is excellent in teaching us that when the victim becomes the oppressor that they must first overcome the pain and righteous indignation before they can begin to empathize with those they have decided to punish. The final step is more sublime for after empathy can come the final step of realization that we all are capable of victimizing and oppressing others in the name of revenge and to justify our pain. Asking for forgiveness breaks the cycle. Walter breaks the cycle and releases Kitty to be fully human.

Bravo for such an excellent and moving film. The entire production takes Maugham's fantastic novel and polishes it into a glowing gem, possibly the best film made in 2007.",1208649600,,6243,4.795539033457249
3377152,5,B001589S0E,"I see this film as a love story, and probably one of the most complicated, realistic and poignant ones I've seen in a while. Instead of two characters who meet, fall in love, and live happily ever after, Kitty and Walter take a much more difficult journey.

Aging playgirl Kitty (Naomi Watts) and nerdy doctor Walter (Edward Norton) marry for all the wrong reasons. Walter's feelings for Kitty are based more on infatuation then on genuine love and respect, and Kitty simply seems to see Walter as a way to escape her family and avoid becoming a spinster. After Kitty has an affair, Walter makes an ultimatum that destroy's Kitty's relationship with her lover, and sends them both to rural China on a mission that is likely to cause one or both of them to die of cholera. The two characters are both so hopelessly disillusioned and depressed at that point that neither seems to care.

Strangely, what is meant to be a bitter ending transforms into a hopeful beginning. Isolated and living in miserable conditions, Kitty and Walter are somehow able to find a sense of purpose and a true appreciation for one another. It's as if the characters first have to despise one another for who they are not before they can love each other for who they are.

It does start slow, but it has to set up the characters. Naomi Watts' character is shallow, immature, self-centered and pretty much a parasite living off her parents.

Since everyone else has synopsized the story,I won't. But give it a chance, it really gets speeding along and is completely unpredictable. I couldn't tell where the plot would take us.

The cinematography is stunning! Having been to Asia and having an airport lay over in Hong Kong I could feel the sticky heat of southern China just watching this movie and I felt myself drawn in. Even if you've never been to Asia, just the camera work and set decoration makes you think you're overseas and back in the 1920's.

One terrible line of dialogue though that slipped through: Naomi Watts tells her husband she's pregnant. His reply, ""With a baby?"" (Well, duh, yeah!) I'm not sure I heard that line right. I'll  have to watch the movie again.

3377159,5,B001589S0E,"""The Painted Veil"" is a remarkable movie. From the first haunting notes of Eric Satie's ""Gnossienne"" to the last plaintive chanson in which we hear the voice of Kitty (Naomi Watts) promising never to forget, the viewer will be mesmerized. Music, in fact, is integral to the story: the Satie piece, which recalls the first encounter of Kitty and Walter (Edward Norton) in an elegant London salon, becomes metaphorical of their troubled marriage as she plunks it out on an out-of-tune upright piano in a rundown convent in China of the 1920s.

The beautifully understated performances of Watts and Norton underscore the complexity of Maugham's seemingly simple story. Particularly notable is the poignant performance of Diana Rigg as the elderly Mother Superior whose own marriage to god has become strained by too many years in the unforgiving climate of rural China, ravaged not only by warring factions but also by cholera.

The lush silk dresses worn by Watts evoke a bygone era, and the superb cinematography transforms what one suspects is smog into a seemingly painted backdrop of looming mist-enshrouded crags that appear to hover between earth and sky, just as the fates of the characters hover between life and death.",1205712000,,1225,5.08955223880597

  Kitty, who is rather shallow and likes games, has little in common with the quiet, cerebral Walter, who is work-obsessed.  She naively believes her new lover, the British Consul (Lev Schreiber) will leave HIS wife for her.  Of course he won't and of course Walter discovers the affair.
In retribution, Walter drags Kitty overland to a cholera epidemic zone, where he struggles to help the suffering locals while making Kitty suffer for her adulteries.

Both characters discover new inner strengths and gradually learn to tolerate, respect, and even forgive each other, as the disease cuts a swathe through the local population.

Magnificent cinematography, authentic Mandarin dialogue and accent, and a great screenplay augment Norton's finest acting job to date.  Support from Toby Jones and Diana Rigg is extraordinary.  Curran directs the Somerset Maugham novel well.

This film is beautiful, gripping, subtle, and worth multiple watchings--so don't hesitate to buy and add to your collection, cinephile or not.

3377161,5,B001589S0E,"""The Painted Veil"" is one of those films that enchant and insinuate their way into your emotions and haunt and haunt. As there are excellent reviews on this page, I did not plan to write one, but without committing to paper, this movie is not going to leave me.

Naomi Watts and Ed Norton are perfectly cast. Is there a story in real life about them? They also co-produced this film based on the novel by the great English writer, Somerset Maugham. Mostly set in China before the Communist Revolution, the story revolves around cholera and its devastating effects on local communities.

But Ed's character, Dr. Walter Fane, and Naomi's, Kitty, come by way of England, where he meets her at a party at her parents' house. She has passed that age when a woman should be comfortably ensconced in her own home and family, but Kitty has commitment phobia. A bacteriologist by career, Dr. Fane is home on leave and possibly seeking a wife. Finally, he convinces Kitty to marry him and they move to China.

In China, one night they attend a Chinese opera with friends of his and she begins an affair with Liev Shrieber's character not long after.  Walter knows and accepts an assignment in the country which needs medical assistance to fight cholera. That's when everything completely unravels in this emotional turmoil set against the physical turmoil of cholera. He treats her like poison and she retreats into herself, a horrible position for such a social woman.

Walter is much too serious and becomes knife-sharp, like his extremely bony body. Now totally socially dependent on her husband, Kitty must reach outside herself if she is to survive. Kitty is invited for tea by the Mother Superior of a nearby orphange. She is a woman of deep wisdom who teaches Kitty how to give of herself, how to really sacrifice and love. Step by step Kitty grows a bit and a bit more, until she volunteers full-time to help the nuns with the children, doing what she knows best, playing piano and teaching songs. During this service she learns the things her husband has been doing, what he is really like, and the depth of character and passion that she has been blind to.

When Kitty begins to reach out to Walter and see him for who he is, he begins to blossom out of himself and under her eyes. The little physical actions of these two actors make this movie: how his hardened face softens and glows from within, how her soft, sinuous body moves toward him. It is a joy to behold watching their emotions and their bodies gradually awaken to each other.

The cinematography shows a lush China, a lush relationship between the government official across the way and his Chinese concubine. Other parallels: the sacrifice of the nuns and Kitty's sacrifice for her husband, emotional turmoil and physical turmoil. The revolt against marriage through adultery with the upcoming Chinese revolt. The ways of a good writer are relentless and show in this beautifully rendered film.

Love and redemption, grace and forgiveness, sincerity and sacrifice--all fine things in the hands of skilled writers and movie makers. ""The Painted Veil"" is a must-see film for the thoughtful person.",1205020800,,3160,4.795955882352941
3377162,5,B001589S0E,"This film caught me by surprise. I hadn't heard much about it, but on a friend's recommendation rented from amazon.

It's an outstanding production. Great location and atmosphere that draws you right in and takes you to the place and period of the story, and in Porter and Watts two fine performances as leading characters that even Maugham would have been proud of.

The score is also excellent. A perfect accompaniment to the film, but a soundtrack that stands up in it's own right too.

The soundtrack won a Golden Globe Award for the film, but I can't believe the film didn't get nominated for any Oscar category at all.

3377166,5,B001589S0E,"Never having read this particular Maugham novel, I was very happily surprised by so much of this film.  First, that Edward Norton and Naomi Watts produced the film, and played in it together as if learning to dance...awkward together at first and out of necessity for Kate; then they ""change partners""; Kate to adultry, Walter to his bacteria; Walter the typical scientific geek; serious, brilliant, somewhat cold and fearful when necessary.  As the movie progresses the cinematic views are incredible!  What a beautiful country this was filmed in.  The hills, meadows, rivers - simply breathtaking.  One of my favorite British actors, Toby Jones of Elizabeth I and Infamous, plays their new and only English speaking neighbor in a small village where a horrible outbreak of cholera pulls Walter to inner China, taking along his petite but healthy wife, Naomi Watts, Kate, on the condition that she goes with him or he divorces her for her adulturous affair with a person she barely knows (Liev Schreiber) but met in Shanghai after marrying Walter (which she did to get away from her mother).  At this point we get to meet nuns played by actors I will look for in the future, and a General I want to see in more movies, as well as Kate's ""protector"" who doesn't really speak but is just adorable!

Their personalities are so different, and they do not know each other at all.  In a way, their neighbor, sensing Kate's tension and sadness, helps to find her something to keep her busy and to put Kate right in Walter's daily path.  All of these things are going on as the ""Nationalists"" begin uprising against the British for being in their country even though Walter is there to do nothing but help and save lives, and even Kate finds a way with her neighbor's assistance to help.  The movie is 1920's, very proper, educational, incredible scenery and Edward Norton just keeps on getting better and better in every successive role, as does Ms. Watts.  The film is captivating.  I have watched it at least ten times and still don't tire of it.  If you enjoy the British accent and want to see beautiful scenery overclouded by the horrors of cholera, and watch a young couple survive a completely irrational marriage, then this will keep you enthralled for a couple of hours if not more.

3377167,5,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil (starring Naomi Watts and Edward Norton) is a stunning film. The story, based on a novel by W. Somerset Maugham, takes place during a cholera epidemic in 1925 China, but it's a timeless story and, with the outbreak of infectious disease angle, the film feels remarkably current. The cinematography and acting are superb and apart from some clunky editing the movie is altogether brilliant.

But what makes the film so striking to me is its honesty about life. The characters are flawed but real, multi-dimensional and struggling with misconceptions about others, a deep need to love and be loved, and a quiet urge to live a life that matters.

Watch this movie but don't study it. Let it draw you in and wrap you up in its moments--both the painful ones and the redemptive ones. It does all that we could ask of a film: it entertains us as it reveals to us what being human really means.",1202860800,,904,4.608695652173913

3377171,3,B001589S0E,"This well-made film based on the eponymous novel by W. Somerset Maugham was co-produced by its two stars, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who obviously were deeply committed to their roles and to the film.  The story is set in 1925.  Norton plays Dr. Walter Fane, a bacteriologist who falls in love with Kitty, played by Watts, an upper-middle-class Englishwoman whose parents are pressuring her to marry as she is getting older.  Although Kitty is not remotely in love with Fane, she agrees to marry him to get away from her mother's nagging, and follows him to Shanghai, where he works in a government laboratory.  Fane, at the beginning of the film, is a somewhat stolid, repressed figure (he insists on turning out the light when they make love) whose passions, until he meets Kitty, have all been focused on his work.  Their marriage more or less stumbles forward, with neither finding the emotional honesty or courage to try to initiate change.  Then Kitty meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a bon vivant, married man-about-town in Shanghai.  Townsend seduces Kitty, and they begin an affair that Dr. Fane discovers.  Fane confronts his wife, and offers her a choice: a disgraceful divorce, with Townsend named as the guilty co-respondent, or Kitty can follow him to a cholera-ridden village in-country, where, as a bacteriologist and a doctor, he will try to bring the epidemic under control.  When Kitty realizes that even with a divorce, Townsend will never leave his wife and marry her, she agrees to follow her husband into the epidemic - much to his satisfaction, as he intends the hardships of the journey and life in-country to punish her.  However, in the weeks that follow, amid heat, humidity, privation, and death, the couple begin to see each other in a different light, through their mutual experiences amid the stricken village: his at the hospital and hers at the orphanage attached to the hospital.  Confronted with horrific realities, the couple's boundaries begin to break down and they begin to communicate more honestly.

The performances are fine, with Norton, particularly, doing his usual understated and unselfish work, Watts believable as the initially petulant Kitty (although not so believable as a borderline ""old-maid""), and Schreiber suitably shallow as the suave seducer.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The film has some very affecting moments.

Yet something about the film is less than the sum of its parts, and the fault lies in the script.  Issues are left hanging and neither explored nor revealed through character development.  Fane is already in love with Kitty as the film opens, yet she does not even know his name.  No history is given - he and she appear, he is a stranger to her, yet he is already in love with her.  The initial stages of their courtship are hurried through, and therefore provide no foundation for their later choices - for example, why Fane refuses to inoculate himself against cholera when they reach the epidemic.  The mutual spiteful ""suicide pact"" that one is asked to accept without that foundation simply doesn't hold up.

The film, thus, has a ""paint by numbers"" quality that allows the viewer to guess the next turns of the plot with unerring accuracy, even if they have not read Maugham's novel.  The film does not so much unfold as ""unwrap"", with all the compartments already clearly labeled as they come out of the box.  One knows, for example, before it happens, that Townsend has no intention of  marrying Kitty.  The viewer can see it coming as Fane offers to divorce Kitty by taking the blame himself, as a ""gentleman"" used to do such circumstances, only if Townsend promises to leave his wife and marry Kitty afterward.  Kitty is the only one shocked at the revelation that Townsend has merely been amusing himself - the viewer has known it all along, and a sense of impatience sets in as we wait for the ""real"" part of the story to begin.

And this quality has deprived the movie, despite its many other assets, of the tension that is a prerequisite for a memorable film.

""The Painted Veil"" is certainly worth seeing once, especially for the earnest and sincere performances of the cast.  But its predictability is unfortunate, as otherwise this might have been one of those romantic films that one returns to again and again.",1200614400,,4323,4.899725274725275
3377172,4,B001589S0E,"There are some very insightful customer reviews on these pages.  The compelling ones for me are from those who have read and remembered Somerset Maugham's book and can compare it to the movie.  For example, I noted with interest the review which points out that the riots and allusions to a pending Communist threat are cinematic artifice and play no role at all in the book.  Typical.

This was a vanity project of sorts for Yale Chinese History major Edward Norton and his co-star, Naomi Watts.  They co-produced the film, which is the third iteration of Maugham's work to make it to the screen.  The two are dour, serious presences here.  And why not?  Their trip to the cholera-infested regions of China amounts to the equivalent (expressed well in another review) of a joint suicide pact...though Watts' character can hardly be called a willing partner at mission outset.

The real stars here are Director John Curran and Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh.  Filmed on location in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangxi, the landscapes and grandeur are breathtaking.",1198972800,,1059,5.0344827586206895
3377173,5,B001589S0E,"The film based on Somerset Maugham's THE PAINTED VEIL earns my high recommendation. The acting is fantastic - Edward Norton delivers a winning performance as Walter Fane (When's this guy going to win an Oscar?) and Naomi Watts embodies a brilliant Kitty Fane. Liev Schreiber stars as Charlie Townsend.

China, 1920s. A cholera epidemic plagues the Chinese countryside while at the same time the government is in political upheaval with the Nationalists vying for power. Bacteriologist Walter Fane and his pretentious, shallow wife Kitty decide to travel into the deep interior to help doctor a small town ravaged by the sickness. Their journey is made all the more complex because of her loveless espousal to Walter and her illicit affair with career politician Charlie Townsend. Of course Walter says that he's going to help the sick town, but his real motive is to remove his wife far away from her paramour and punish her in the process.

Seldom do I see a film that portrays a love story with this level of complexity. Married and loveless, Walter and Kitty have to travel an incredible distance between themselves if they ever hope to find love in their relationship. The journey is flawless and deep. Add to their journey the exotic setting of the Chinese countryside, the political unrest between Communism and freedom, the music and dancing intrinsic to Kitty's shallow soul, the battle against a ravaging disease, the overarching themes of religious truth and the brainwashing philanthropy of the Catholic nuns, and the discovery of new life and grace amid the bleakest of circumstances, and you've got a story that transcends the mundane and moves the heart. While arguably slow in parts, the tension of Walter and Kitty's relationship is masterful and a joy to watch in the hands of two accomplished actors.

In this story, however, the veil is indeed lifted as a man and a woman discover true life and true love by giving their lives for others. A dull civil servant, Dr. Fane, brilliantly played by Edward Norton and a shallow, silly debutante called Kitty (Naomi Watts) make a disastrous marriage of convenience. Only by going to a remote area of China to assist some helpless villagers in a cholera epidemic do the couple find themselves and each other. Dr. Fane is revealed to be man of courage and ingenuity; Kitty, with the help of some feisty nuns, learns to put the needs of others first. Her inner depths are unveiled as she discovers the reality of love. Diana Rigg portrays the Mother Superior who describes her own spiritual journey to Kitty.

Adapted from Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel and starring Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and a bravely makeup-eschewing Diana Rigg, The Painted Veil tells us of Walter Fane, a young doctor (so many of Maugham's characters were doctors) who falls in love with Kitty Garstin, a beautiful woman from a moneyed family, who impulsively weds the doctor in order to both escape and punish her callous mother. Soon finding herself re-located along with her husband to Shanghai, Kitty is stranded on the far side of the world amid unfamiliar people and places, married to a man she does not love and with whom she has virtually nothing in common. In the wake of his wife's eventual affair with a caddish playboy, Dr. Fane forces Kitty to move with him once more, this time into the primitive countryside of the Chinese interior, where a cholera epidemic is taking human life in appalling numbers long unseen back in Europe. Where once he had been filled with passionate love for Kitty, Walter now hates himself for ever loving her, and treats Kitty with punitive coldness and disdain. Isolated, facing horrors nothing in either of their pasts has prepared them for, the couple enter an existence which tries the human spirit, and recreates each of them into something greater than either could once ever have been. Maugham's story of romantic love, betrayal, redemption and higher love is magnificently unfolded here in one of the more worthwhile novel-to-screen productions of the decade.

Although I think they are very talented, In THIS particular movie they were just not endearing AS A COUPLE in a love story should be.
There was little character development in both of these characters, and THAT made me care very little about what happened to either of them.

Rather than go through a scandalous divorce with her husband (Norton)over her affair, He blackmails her to move to China with him in the middle of a ""chlorea"" epidemic that is killing off people by the hundreds. He resents her so badly that it makes one wonder why he would want her with him at all. This storyline just did not make any sense to me.

Still though... there was a lot of things I LOVED about the movie. The cinematography was awesome, just beautiful ! - and the scenery was gorgeous too,China in all of it's beauty.

Well, one more thing to be said in its favor...Watts and Norton are well-cast, according to their characters in the book.  However, the story is not faithful to the book...far from it.

The book is a wonderfully multi-dimensional tale of lust, disappointment, and above all, a woman's spiritual awakening.  The film touched only superficially on the first two, totally leaving the third out.

The title of the book ""The Painted Veil"" is supposed to point to Kitty's growing understanding that a spiritual world lives beyond the superficial ""veil"" of this one.  Her experience with the nuns and the wrenching experience of her affair and subsequent rejection by her husband leads to her spiritual awakening.  None of that in the film.

Rather, the film depicts a rather cliched story of a woman who marries out of necessity, has an affair, then falls in love with her husband and she with him.  Blech.  How boring.

The movie is filmed and takes place in the karst country of southern/SW China. The beautiful shades of green of paddy rice and the tall karsts dominate the view just as the river dominates the people's lives. This beauty alone is worth watching the movie.

It is a story of a rich spoiled woman, who marries a man she does not love to escape the fate of ""an old maid"" and her mother's sharp tongue. Her new husband is the 1920's British equivalent of today's geek, he being a MD-bacteriologist stationed in Shanghai. He volunteers to go work with a remote rural village under siege from cholera and backmails his new bride into going with him over an affair she had that he knows about. The plot is their falling in love in the midst of continuing death and danger from anti-foreigner antipathy from the Chinese.

The plot is interesting and involving, the beauty of the land overwhelming, the point of the movie poignant and heartmoving. All which make the film excellent thought and viewing pleasure.
It would even make a worthwhile movie for a small group discussion over several important issues: the meaning of love and marriage, the importance of believing in something noble and sacrificial service to that ideal.",1189900800,,1370,4.7238493723849375

3377191,4,B001589S0E,"2006' ""The Painted Veil"" has so much going for it, it should have been another ""English Patient"" -- a retro romance that sweeps awards and captures hearts.

Instead we have that most frustrating creature -- a very, very good movie that just misses the mark of greatness.

Even so - if you like period romances, you may love what is lovable in this movie enough to forgive it its flaws.

What ""The Painted Veil"" has going for it:

1.) The plot of the Somerset Maughm novel. A nerdy, scientific, cuckolded husband, who knows his beautiful, shallow, society wife married him because she was dangerously close to being an old maid and wanted to get away from her mother, punishes her for an affair by taking her to a remote Chinese cholera epidemic. Yawza! How operatic!

2.) Sky-high production values. ""The Painted Veil"" was filmed on location in China. Locations were mixed and matched. At one point they were along the Li River, among Guilin's famous karst scenery. Karst is the ""lumpy"" looking limestone topography. Towers rise abruptly, and weirdly,  out of river valleys, fringed by lush rice paddies and bamboo. The village Huang Yao is a five-hundred years old, intact Ming Dynasty town.

3.) Edward Norton is perfection. He gives Walter everything he needs -- as the nerdy, scientist cuckold husband, Walter is, by turns, arrogant, insecure, vengeful, loving, sweet, icy cold, naive, calculating ... you see it all on his face, and fear him, feel for him, and forgive him.

4.) Alexandre Desplat's award-winning score. Minimalist, and yet it conveys the plot's sense of entrapped passions and spiritual dimensions. Very good use is made of Eric Satie's Gnossienne # 1 and ""A La Claire Fontaine,"" a French folksong whose bittersweet lyrics, which can be found on the web, are so appropriate to the plot that they are heartbreaking.

5.) Diminutive blond Toby Jones' depiction of Waddington, a British provincial officer who is just barely keeping up appearances, in his day old stubble, shabby, sweat-stained suits, and live-in Chinese lover, young enough to be his daughter. Jones pumps this small role full of life. In another actor's hands Waddington would have been forgetable; with Jones, he's one of the most interesting features of the movie.

6.) The Love / Sex / Death / Religion / Self-Sacrifice nexus that modern pop culture doesn't even seem to realize exists; any work of art that reminds us that what we love is mortal and that God and Sex live next door to each other in our brains / souls / lives is way ahead of the pack.

7.) A scene from a Chinese opera. A vermilion and turquoise costume. Lin Zheng's brilliant performance.

8.) Anthony Wong as Colonel Yu. Again, a minor part, but Wong is riveting.

What I wish had been different:

1.) Liev Schreiber has an unmistakable earnestness that just doesn't work for him to be believable as a rake, cad, and bounder. He was much better as the earnest, befuddled cuckold in ""Walk on the Moon.""

2.) Naomi Watts. She's very pretty and very sweet and I just never, ever believed her as a shallow, devastatingly beautiful socialite who could drive two men to irresponsible action.

I kept thinking of Greta Garbo in the original ""Painted Veil,"" or Vivien Leigh as that insufferable monster, Scarlett -- as much as you hate her, you are fascinated. Not so with Watts.

3.) John Curran's direction. This is a MELODRAMA, John. Walter says, ""I despise myself for loving you."" Kitty says, ""If a man doesn't have what it takes to make a woman love him, that's his fault."" I mean, how can you direct that so anemically? As if they are asking for change to buy cheez crackers from the vending machine? In melodrama, you have to turn up the heat, send a few lightening bolts across the screen.

4.) The ending. I didn't need a happy or a sad ending. I just needed an ending that would serve the plot, and feel less like a dead end, a flat tire, that drained, rather than contributed, meaning to what has come before.",1189209600,,3973,4.7416545718432515
3377192,2,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil has it all going for itself. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton leading, two great actors.  An interesting theme and issue, Cholera in China in 1920 and a great location to tease beauty from, but none of this is taken to its advantage.  The movie was such a disappointment. I honestly thought that since I read so many good reviews of this film, it's going to pick up soon.  But it never did. Honestly, the only good thing about this movie was the scenery and acting.  That's it.  The storyline seemed good, but, was this movie a bore! It lasted roughly two hours, but it seemed like a good five. I was wondering when the heck this movie was going to end. It was so long and drawn out. The entire movie was dialogue. That's it. There was no action whatsoever.

3377193,5,B001589S0E,"This adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel with the same title is stunning visually, and emotionally wrenching.  It ends with brilliant simplicity, leaving your mind and heart still entrapped in the story -- it's the kind of film you'll still be thinking about 2 days later while sipping a cup of tea.  Curran creates magic with his sweeping scenery, efortlessly emphasizing the isolation and loneliness Walter and Kitty are facing - both physically and emotionally.  Edward Norton truly becomes Walter, somehow managing to make clear Walter's growth through the film without losing the simple, quiet character he is.  Norton deserves every one of the awards he won for this movie and many more.  Naomi Watts is given the somewhat easier task of presenting Kitty, whose transformation is more active.  She too brings her screen persona to life beautifully -- moving from selfish young woman to shattered soul to simple strength without emotional manipulation or losing the essence of the story.  The two together bring a chemistry that touches the audience at the core of our being - and does so with a degree of subtlety that is rare today.

If you are a fan of the big budget, overproduced, special effects laden films that are so prevalent today, this will not impress you.  The film simply flows -- no forced action or rush.  If you are willing to ride along with the current, however, it is unforgettable.  This movie is a flashback to a day when films managed to convey in few words much meaning.  Curran's cinematography is a blend of a strong, simple script, poignant use of color and camera placement, and powerful actors.  With that recipe it is no surprise that for those of us looking for a true experience film, Painted Veil is a hit.

PS-- the title itself refers to a sonnet by Percy Byshe Shelley called ""Lift not the Painted Veil,"" which is well worth googling if you want a glimpse at the movie's depth.",1189209600,,1925,4.793939393939394
3377194,4,B001589S0E,"If you haven't watched this movie, it helps to be aware that it is a slow-moving story. Don't expect of action or adventure and you won't be disappointed. Although set mostly in an exotic locale under revolutionary-type conditions, it is a bit of an adventure story but it is mostly a subtle romance.

It's a story of a couple who married despite one not loving the other but learning to as time goes by. Normally, that wouldn't particularly appeal to me, especially with a female that is cold and sarcastic as Naomi Watts' ""Kitty Fane"", but this film had an odd appeal. It has a tension running through it for the first three-quarters of the film, that makes you want to keep watching and find out what happens.

It doesn't hurt that it's beautifully filmed and that always-entertaining Edward Norton plays the male lead, Kitty's husband ""Walter."" Norton is one of the few modern-day American actors who could surprise us with a British accent and make it sound natural, forgetting quickly that he's faking an accent. He's that subtle.

Things got much more interesting once they travelled inland; the photography is exquisite, and attention to detail is right-on. Norton and, especially, Watts are very fine, and it's always great to see Diana Rigg, even so briefly. The plot is simple enough (I won't give it all away as everyone else did), and the proceedings are handled well, though it moved too slowly for me. This period in Chinese history holds no end of intrigue, and being caught in a cholera epidemic with the Chinese Nationals approaching created a bit of angst. There is a smattering of redemption, and the suggested feminist twist at the end was a fine addition. Check it out, but be sure there are no distractions.",1188604800,,835,4.687074829931973

3377201,5,B001589S0E,"Read the ""Is it possible to fall in love with virtue?"" review. It does great justice to this beautiful film.

This was a challenging movie, a very unusual love story, where two unhappy people who initially lack a shared connection or chemistry, grow to respect one another, and from this respect springs passion. Not the usual pattern of events- and a challenge to communicate convincingly. Very few actors could have portrayed this relationship so seamlessly. Watts and Norton delivered exceptionally mature performances - they really should be credited as brilliant for pulling this off.  So subtle too, not a bit over the top; their clean, quiet performances were nearly flawless.

Another essential ingredient to this movie, aside from the the historical setting (the Orient during a cholera epidemic) is the musical score. It does so much to set the tone of this film, and it is as perfect as Watts and Norton's acting.

This movie's beauty makes one weep. I wish I could do it justice with words, but I can not. Just don't miss the chance to see it.",1187136000,,1055,4.844444444444444
3377202,5,B001589S0E,"One of the first things you'll notice about `The Painted Veil' is it's crisp beauty and elegance.  It's effortlessly filmed with such expansive grandeur it's impossible not to become enthralled in its scenery, both human and atmospheric.  The next thing you're sure to realize is that young Naomi Watts is sure to be one of our finest working actresses, for with every subtle movement of her facial features, her graceful fingertips or any other part of her beautifully constructed body she gives off the essence of brilliance, portraying the exact emotion we need to understand and cultivating in herself and in her audience a trust within this woman that begs to be established.  She effortlessly moves in and out of her emotions with such skill it's astonishing to me she was utterly ignored throughout awards season.

There is so much more to love and appreciate within this fabulous film, but it rests on the shoulders of the beautiful backdrop and the even more beautiful Watts to carry us to a place we would otherwise never venture.

The film, which is based on the novel written by W. Somerset Maugham, centers around the marriage and relationship between Walter and Kitty Fane.  Walter is a very shy bacteriologist who pursues Kitty's hand despite the fact that Kitty herself is not fairly interested.  Peer pressure from her family and that aching feeling of failure push Kitty into a marriage she is not invested in and soon her longing for real love leads her into adultery with married Charlie.  After uncovering her tryst Walter gives Kitty some options.  Walter has volunteered to help a small town ravaged by a severe cholera epidemic.  Kitty must either come with him or he will publicly divorce her.  Her only suitable (by her terms) way out would be to have Charlie agree to divorce his wife and marry her.  He of course declines the idea and Kitty is forced to accompany Walter.

Upon their arrival Kitty is appalled with their new living conditions, frightened even, and the growing distance between Walter and herself is making the transition all the more difficult.  `The Painted Veil' ultimately is about growth and understanding and the power of love overcoming all.  Kitty married a man for whom she had no love for, a man whom she really didn't even know and understand, but watching him in his element, helping all these people, fighting for their health and survival helped Kitty to realize that she respected him and ultimately she falls in love with him.  He helps her become a better person and likewise she helps him become a more desirable person.  `The Painted Veil' succeeds beautifully in creating a love story for the ages.

Aside from the magnificent `Oscar Worthy' Watts there are quite a few very strong performances within this film.  Edward Norton, who co-produced this film, turns out yet another powerful performance as Walter.  Norton is one of my favorite actors for he always invests himself so deeply in his performances.  He had a very strong year in 2006 with `The Painted Veil' following `The Illusionist' and `Down in the Valley', each performance just as strong as the next.  Here he beautifully captures the heart of this man, broken and depressed realizing the woman he loves has disregarded him, and the barriers he builds for himself to protect the dignity he has left is nothing short of wholeheartedly believable and relatable.  Toby Jones, better known as `the other Capote' turns in a key performance as the Fane's neighbor, and Diana Rigg is just superb as the runner of the orphanage where Kitty finds her redemption.

Aside from Watts though I feel the star of this film is none other than director John Curran who infuses so much life and atmosphere into this film that the audience is drawn in from the very beginning.  He captures so brilliantly the time and era, his surroundings but most importantly the emotions of his characters.  `The Painted Veil' truly is a near perfect film, one that is sure to find a place in your heart and make an impact on your very soul.",1186963200,,4037,4.822931785195936

I GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY WHICH WAS MANIFICENT.

I WAS STRUCK WITH THE RIOTING CHINESE DEPICTED, WHICH IN FACT WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE BOOK AT ALL.

APPROACHED BY CHARLIE, HER PAST LOVER WHO LOOKS AT THE YOUNG BOY IMPLYING THAT HE THINKS IT  HIS CHILD AND THE SHORT INTERECHANGE BETWEEN THEM AS KITTY FADES AWAY IN THE LONDON STREET WITH HER CHILD WAS ABSOLUTELY RUBBISH AND IN NO WAY WAS CONNECTED TO THE BOOK.

AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I ORDERED THE BOOK AND RE-READ IT AND FOUND IT FASCINATING WITH MANY PASSAGES THAT WERE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAT I FIND STILL UNFORGETTABLE.

TO SUMMRIZE:  IF YOU NEVER READ THE BOOK NOR INTEND TO, THEN THIS DVD COULD POSSSIBLY BE FOR YOU, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LITTLE BEARING WITH BOOK.
HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK AND HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED AS I HAVE, THEN I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD AT ALL.  SADLY, DIANA RIGG'S CHARACTER AS THE MOTHER SUPERIOR COULD HAVE BEEN ENRICHED IF GIVEN MORE EXPOSURE.

This movie tries to capture that spirit of the book and I thought Edward Norton did a fine work. He was able to convey the simmering, unexpressed anger within him and the overt anger sometime emerging out of him, as the culmination of a buildup of grievances with the protagonist Kitty Fane( Naomi Watts). I liked Naomi Watts also, particularly her role during the later part of the movie when she realizes what and who truly matters in the life.
The movie also depicts the old time China beautifully and the sad reminder of the killer diseases like cholera. Expect mixed emotions as you watch this movie, it's not exactly a family movie, so watch when you feel like  reflecting on your own life, counting your blessings etc...you get the idea..

3377209,5,B001589S0E,"It's very unusual, these days, to see a husband and wife, seemingly ""mismatched,"" grow through marriage into a true and deep love for one another.  Kitty is self-absorbed and pleasure-seeking, Walter is serious, oriented toward research and service.  Bound to fail, right?  Eharmony would never pair these two...and some marriage counselors would say, ""Forget it.""

Others have described the plot very well, I won't repeat it here.  It's easy to downgrade Kitty, she marries for all the wrong reasons...but she's right that virtuous guys can sometimes be boring.  Edward Norton does a fantastic job of portraying the intellectual loner who is originally spellbound by Kitty...so spellbound that he doesn't really relate to her as she is...she is almost an object of worship to him.  Naturally this fails to awaken her passion.  Not that I am meaning to excuse her, just to say that there is room for growth in BOTH people in this movie.  When he is cuckolded, Walter reacts by retreating into rigid rectitude...but we always know that he still loves Kitty, even though he is terribly hurt and cannot believe that she will ever change.  When they begin to open up to each other again, Walter is transformed as well, moving beyond his initial one-dimensional view of Kitty to accept her as a person that he can respect, even though she is still the lighthearted musician who plays for the orphans to dance.  He is more of a man, and she has grown into womanhood by falling in love with his virtue...not just any virtue, but HIS.

It's a fine movie.  Not slow, unless you have no taste for nuance and beauty.  Waddington and his Chinese girlfriend are a sort of Mozartian parallel couple (Papageno/Papagena) to Walter and Kitty (Tamino/Pamina).  It is clear from the brief focus on the girlfriend that she truly loves Waddington. Kitty's realization of this is a turning point, and this scene is masterfully acted by all.

On top of all that, the music, from French folk song to Satie, is used with perfect appropriateness to the action.  The ending is realistic and perfectly satisfying, even though not ""happy"" in the traditional sense.  5 stars, you bet!",1184976000,,2154,4.887052341597796

I found that I enjoyed the movie more than the book because the movie portrayed more of Kitty's realization of love for her husband. It's a love situation that happens more often than we thought. A woman has a good man, but thinks that another man has something that her man doesn't, only to realize in the end that her man is the better man after all. Sadly, to Kitty, the realization came too late.

I don't know why I love this movie so much despite its gory details. I usually don't like movies with disturbing images but I love this movie despite of it. It's a brilliant piece of art. Edward Norton is marvellous in it, he portrays Dr. Fane well as a man whom one would pity him at first, understand him later, and love him in the end. Naomi Watts is perfect for her role. Her luminous skin, which is an emphasized point in the book, is one of her best assets shown in this movie.

3377212,3,B001589S0E,"Previous reviewers pointed out many positive aspects of this very well made movie ""The Painted Veil.""  I have no negative comment regarding Edward Norton's or Naomi Watt's acting skills.  This film meets the stardard quality of ""Hollywood"" production that one would expect nowadays.  However, as a movie afficionado and a movie critique, I can not help but feel some disappoint at the overall quality of the movie.
The movie begins with very appealling and stunning scenaries of China.  The beginning reminded me of other great romantic dramas that take place in adventurous places, like ""Cold Mountain"" or ""Legends of Fall.""  But, from that point on, the whole story takes a wrong turn and declines precipitously.
The biggest problem with this movie is its screenplay.  It is supposed to be based on W. Somerset Maugham's novel.  Because I haven't read the novel, I cannot comment on how well this movie adopts the original novel, but at the end of the movie, I felt that a great opportunity was lost because of many weaknesses in the storyline.  As many people probably know, W. Somerset Maugham wrote ""The Moon and Six Pence"" and other novels.  Maugham had a recurring theme of Victorian English man's disallusionment with the post-industrial, Capitalism, and overly idealized fantasy with Oriental, tribal women.  Maugham particularly dwelled on Victorian English male's sexual fantasy, sexual encounters with sexually liberated tribal women in his novels.  In the movie, the screenplay tries to keep up that literary theme from Maugham's novels.  IN this movie, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton appear as a newly wed couple, who do not know each other well, and embarks upon this un-predicted journey into the deep, heart-land of China.  This beginning gives a great setting for an amazing tale of love, sacrifice, and romance.  The story pretty much ends at that point.  New characters, such as Mr. Waddington or his ""oriental"" sex-slave, greatly damage the existing main relationship between the two main characters.  There are too many un-necessary story developments that detract from the tension between Mr and Mrs. Fane (Norton and Watts).  IN the end, the story becomes too monotonous and insipid.  It was a great disappointment to me, because the beginning of the movie had such a great promise of strong and memorable story, but it ends up being just an adaptation of a poorly written novel.
I suppose I can give five stars for the production, visual presentation, music, etc.  But, I believe that the screenplay writers could've done a much better job to develop a memorable, enduring romance between Mr. and Mrs. Fane (main characters).",1184371200,,2649,5.104408352668213

Not only does it have beautiful scenes as promised, but the writing and the actors themselves were quite strong. Norton especially made one memorable and definitely likeable character.

From beginning to end I was kept in interest of this story and yes did have a part of me hoping this marriage on the rocks would turn into a finally passionate romance. The ending is terribly sad though. I wasn't expecting it and didn't really want it to end that way- nonetheless, it was realistic so I really won't complain. Just sorry that it happened.

Overall I highly recommend The Painted Veil. It turned out to be much more than I expected it would be.

Basic Plot:  Young and plain in social standing but endowed with beauty, Kitty marries Dr. Walter, a shy and reserved bacteriologist who adores Kitty but does not have the personality to show it.  Driven by boredom and a loveless marriage - loveless on Kitty's part - she commits adultery with a charming diplomat.  With the discovery of his wife's adultery Dr. Walter takes his unwilling wife to the central part of the deadly cholera epidemic.  And there the love story begins.

This movie is one of the few recent movies that I saw that did not disappoint my expectations.  I believe that a `true' love story - love stories that are not only trying to be cute but really portray the love that we experience in real life - should reflect realities honestly and accurately.  And this I believe cannot be accomplished merely by good acting and directing but with the right team.  Norton and Watts was such a team.
The choice of the backdrop of this love story could not have been more odd - a cholera infested China town.  But their love was like a rose in the middle of a plant-less, muddy swamp.  Because the movie paints such a picture, the love story seems even more beautiful.  But that is not all.  Although this is a love story, the story honors the scare of the cholera outbreak and the ghostly atmosphere of the town.  This authentic scenery is disturbing but elevates the level of the movie.

This is one of my favorite love stories in recent films.",1182556800,,1471,4.582375478927203
3377225,4,B001589S0E,"Somerset Maugham's Painted Veil takes you back to pre-revolution, rural China of the 1920's via the suffocating class snobbery of Edwardian London.  The is a beautifully poised and presented film. It will indulge you by gently transporting you to a world of chaotic change. You'll get a glimpse of the fear, misery and helplessness of rural peasants during a cholera outbreak.

Ed Norton plays Dr Thane, who's emotions have recklessley taken him and his wife, played by Naomi Watts, into the seat of the epidemic, ostensibly to help battle the contagion. His subtext is a deathwish for either him or his wife.

The film gently ebbs and twists through its plot, and so greatly emphasises the acting.
Watts delivers a moving and sensitive performance  which is gripping. The enigmatic Norton lends this quality to Doctor Thane, and in doing so, leaves us with a slightly hollow character.

Ed Norton appears to have acting talents that are yet to mature. In this portrayal, his naturally and intensley sunny charm with his captivating boyish smile, undoes his fine portrayal of Dr Thane. The character doesn't quite make sense and therefore undermines the story. He can be a great actor, but he needs to put away the boy and the smile and give his talents their full reign.

Diana Rigg gives a magnificent and imperious performance as Mother Superior of the orphanage. She positively crackles with power and haughty, sinister beneficence.

Also notable is Toby Jones, who plays Waddington, a British nabob gone native. Jones injects a solidity into this character which greatly help move the story along.

With such a talented cast, with a real and rich story, you'd be forgiven for expecting more from this film.

An enjoyable film, but a hollow feeling at the end.",1182470400,,1764,4.952542372881356

Although the story moves slowly, it's beautiful and serene and somehow, you understand that it's not going to be a traditional happy end but that's not the point. Very interesting take on what it's like to fall in love and what at first seems dull becomes completely opposite once you give it a chance.",1182470400,,465,4.535714285714286
3377227,4,B001589S0E,"Quite enjoyable.  The scenery is striking--especially those exotic Chinese mountains--and the acting is supurb. The central and most interesting aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the evolution and development of the character Kitty (Naomi Watts).

Kitty, a spoiled and selfish rich girl, marries the socially awkward research physician, Dr. Walter Fane (Norton) just to spite her meddlesome parents.  She has little regard for the good doctor, even though he is madly in love with her, and she spites him by having an affair with the philandering Charlie Townsend.  Dr. Fane turns out to be not as niave and timorous as she believes, and when he sternly confronts her, she chooses to follow him into the cholera-ridden interior of China rather than face an ignominious divorce.  While there, she must endure boredom and the flinty indifference of her spouse, until she finds meaning and purpose serving in the village orphanage.  In the process of time, she learns to appreciate her husband, and develops a true and selfless emotional bond with him.  In the end, we see a mature, self-possessed young women, having both self-respect as well as devotion to family.

The music is also lovely.  Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang and composer Alexandre Desplat team up for some subtle yet memorable melodies.  But I must say that the children's choir singing the French song (A La Claire Fontaine)at the very end of the movie is piercingly gorgeous.",1182297600,,1449,5.050420168067227

3377229,5,B001589S0E,"Produced by it's two stars, Watts & Norton, this film takes the viewer to a time & place ripe with beauty and fraught with danger.  Like all remarkable stories, The Painted Veil takes the viewer on a journey; not just from 1920's London to Shanghai and deep into the Chinese interior, but through the human heart.  Through Kitty and Walter Frane, whose relationship will prove as challenging as the cholera epidemic decimating the countryside, we discover the depth and capacity that exist within the human being for change, forgiveness and love.

The cinematography is so evoctive that one feels the oppressive humidity of the season on the Chinese plains and hillsides.

Ms. Watts classic features and clipped precise Britishness, work perfectly for the thoughtless and vapid Kitty in the early days of the film.  It is only deep into the film, that one senses the true gifts of Ms. Watts as an actor, as with one look or movement she conveys the pain and courage of a woman discovering her true self.

His boyish good looks might have hindered believability in playing a man of such complex and contradictory nature, but fortunately, Edward Norton is more than matinee idol good-looks.  Norton is a brilliant and instinctual performer who slips chameleon-like into each new role.  His Walter is the man each and every audience member can understand, because we've each and everyone experienced great joy, great anger, the urge for revenge and ultimately the need to forgive and begin again.  Norton's movements and indeed his vocal range are small to non-existant throughout much of the film.  So much so, that when he does indeed make the grand gesture its affects are deeply felt.  It is not often one can refer to a studied performance without sounding as if the performer relied on acting techniques , but there is a strong sense of intelligence, without the loss of real emotion in each of Mr. Norton's performances and the Painted Veil is no exception.

Liev Schreiber, as the caddish married lover of Naomi Watts' Kitty Frane, reminded me of William Powell or Errol Flynn.  Mr. Schreiber adds his own special touch of class to an already stylish little film gem.

Just a beautiful film to be relished.",1182297600,,2211,4.877005347593583

I found the colour and the editing to be exquisite, in fact.

I personally felt that the pacing of the film was the biggest problem. In fact, it dragged severely in my opinion. No matter how compelling a story or how good the actors, if the pace is slow then the film
 simply has no energy and suffers from jet lag. I personally admire the work of Edward Norton, but this film simply left me flat. That it received  nominations did not surprise me at all. That it won none did not surprise me either.",1182211200,,836,4.339743589743589
3377231,4,B001589S0E,"In this 2007 film adaptation of the Somerset Maughn novel, lead actors Edward Norton and Naomi Watts render subtle and praiseworthy performances that brings this classic story of an adulterous wife's voyage of self-discovery during the cholera epidemic in 1920's China to a grand panoramic celluloid life akin to the scenic beauty depicted in ""Out of Africa"" complimented with a soaring soundtrack by Alexandre Michel Desplat.  Alluding to the first line of the sonnet by Percy Blythe Shelley:

 ""Lift not the painted veil which those who live
Call Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,
And it but mimic all we would believe
With colours idly spread behind, lurk Fear
And Hope, twin Destinies; who ever weave
Their shadows, o'er the chasm, sightless and drear,""

the film's characters waltz around this theme of perceived images and identities.  Dr. Walter Fane is blinded by his wife's selfishness while Kitty sees her husband only as a functionary intent on his duty.  Only when the two ""lift"" the painted veil of these iconic public personas do they actually see within and glimpse at each other's spirits.

For me, any film featuring Edward Norton is worth watching.  As Dr. Walter Fane in this adaptation of the Somerset Maughn novel, ""The Painted Veil,"" again, this superb actor does not disappoint.

Some reviewers claim that Norton's performance seems wooden and two-dimensional.  I disagree.  Norton's boyish good looks add to his vulnerability as a husband who has discovered his wife's indiscretion.  The seemingly cardboard sternness he projects shimmers with nuanced frustration, anger and pride; he cannot look at his wife for fear that with one glance she will glimpse the soft underbelly he has hidden beneath his outraged austerity.

Similarly, Naomi Watts equally outdoes herself as Kitty, the wayward wife.  With her brunette marcel-styled hair - I have to wonder at this choice of looks for this character---she epitomizes the selfish, emotionally immature woman that wins and breaks Norton's heart.  Kitty's ultimate epiphany occurs gradually.  Watt's perfect porcelain complexion glows like a waxing moon as she untangles herself from her own preoccupation and see the man she married as truly noble and more than worthy of lifetime devotion.

The film's one fault may be that once its climatic scene plays out, the ending follows far too quickly, forcing the audience to digest Kitty's reawakened self-awareness in a drive-thru timeframe rather than in the deliberate haute cuisine mode it deserves.

Bottom line?  ""The Painted Veil"" offers much to an audience that favors the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" genre of entertainment.  A lush backdrop, notable performances and a classic story succeed in propelling the viewer back in time to the uncertain yet familiar territory explored by the human heart.  Recommended.

3377232,2,B001589S0E,"Good performances, strong cinematography and an exquisite soundtrack can all be found in this version of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, which is a good thing since only a phantom of his novel can be pinpointed.  Kitty's search for spiritual and personal development has been shoved to the side and replaced by her need to be loved. The enigmatic Walter Fane is here converted to a romantic hero and far more vocal/expressive than he was ever meant to be on the page. I just don't understand why the characters needed to be altered so dramatically in order to tell the tale, no matter how distorted.

Notable in many reviews of this film, was the fact many critics found the characters unlikeable. Well, yes, but they were also far more likeable and less transformative than how they were portrayed in the film.  Romantizing the plot to the degree where it became all about love and - to secure the Chinese seal of approval required to allow filming - distorting Walter's role in the containment of the cholera epidemic did nothing for the film except to pander needlessly for the Oscar nominations which it got, but not in any major categories.

Norton's portrayal of Walter Fane starts out well enough and true to Maugham's original novel, but as the affair is revealed, his character loses the one characteristic he is able to retain in the novel - his bloodlessness.  In the climatic confrontation in the novel, he tells Kitty,  ""I had no illusions about you. I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It's comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew.""

The 'veil' that was lifted had nothing to do with his perception of Kitty; the veil was the self-involved cluelessness that Kitty was entrenched in so deeply that she was lured towards the shallow vapidness of Charlie and in the process broke the heart of the one person who loved her despite her weaknesses and asked only that she be loyal to him. Walter wanted only what he had been able and willing to give Kitty - selfless loyalty and affection.

Maugham's stories are well-paced, studied and full of emotion. It's a shame that a true version of ""The Painted Veil"" will probably never be seen. Hollywood for the third time neglects the true journey - that of a woman to her own heart, motivation and life - in favor of yet another journey between two people.",1182124800,,2761,4.5636363636363635

She soon gets bored with Walter, and finds herself embroiled in a passionate affair with the married British Vice-Consul, Charles Townsend [Liev Shreiber]. The affair however is doomed because Charles is a lothario who enjoys his fun too much for lasting emotional attachments. Kitty finds herself being found out, and Walter exacts his revenge by compelling Kitty to accompany him to a remote village where cholera is rampant. The rest of the movie deals with the emotional complexities of two tormented souls who are brought together under harsh and unforgiving circumstances and learn to come to terms with each other. The two leads here are compelling and believable in their roles, and in fact though Watts and Shreiber are a real-life couple, what struck me more was the great chemistry between Watts and Norton. The cinematography is simply beautiful, evoking the lush Chinese rural landscape, and the score is equally haunting. There are also good supporting roles here - the Mother Superior [Diana Rigg], Shreiber and a few others all add to the emotional depth of this very human drama.

She's just married a stodgy doctor (Edward Norton) who has taken her away from her dilettantish life in London for the mind-numbing boredom of colonial Shanghai.  Kitty's problem is that she thinks love should be passionate and marriage should be a source of amusement.  Having lived a privileged life, she has no regard for the political turmoil taking place in China.  She also has no regard for her hard-working husband.  Instead, Kitty indulges in a wild affair with the British Vice Consul (Liev Schreiber).  Her husband is no fool, however.  He quickly catches onto the affair.  As such, he gives her an ultimatum.  She can either go with him to a cholera stricken village or he can sue her for divorce in a time where divorce is based on fault (e.g. allegations of adultery).  Kitty quickly realizes that her lover is all talk, and will never leave his wife for her.  She therefore makes the journey to remote Mei-tan-fu with her husband.  There, Kitty's eyes are opened to a world far beyond what she could ever imagine.  Too late, she realizes that she loves her husband.  But her mind is finally clear, like a clear fountain - hence the haunting and riveting rendition of ""a la claire fontaine"" as the final tune.",1180310400,,1390,4.662551440329218

3377250,4,B001589S0E,"""...behind, lurk Fear and Hope, twin Destinies."" ""The Painted Veil,"" which is based upon a story by W. Somerset Maugham, is a very well made film. The acting is first-rate, the direction fine and the cinematography often gorgeous. The story, however, lends itself much better to the printed medium rather than the celluloid. I began looking at the clock an hour into this two-hour film, a sign which is never good. This film helps remind us that great filmmaking does not necessarily a great film make. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who also produced, play a married English couple living in China during the 1920s. Her love affair with another man, played by Watts' real-life mate Liev Schreiber, should have doomed their marriage. Out of dignity (or is it spite?), Dr. Fane (Norton) takes his wife to the middle of a cholera-stricken town. As a bacteriologist, he feels it is his duty to help eradicate the disease. Will his altruistic nobility influence his selfish young wife? Fans of Maugham, the 1934 film version with Greta Garbo or of the novel itself might find this filmed version of interest, though I would forewarn those looking for either intense drama or satisfactory romance that this one requires a good deal of patience.

It starts with the credits, a painterly, dreamlike kaleidoscope of opening flowers, single-celled organisms and duotones of Chinese peasants that hint at the story to come: one of a love that evolves, grows and blossoms as its couple faces a cholera outbreak in China. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts (both artistic specimens in their own right) play their parts with delicate strokes, as do supporting stars Liev Schreiber, Toby Jones and, though nearly unrecognizable without makeup, Diana Rigg. Watts, especially, perfectly captures her role.

This beautifully written, and produced movie, grabs you from the start. Gives insight to the day when marriages weren't all about love, sometimes, or at least don't start out that way, in this case.

It is a great journey, going from marrying without knowing each other, but having certain expectations from one another. Like behaviors, Walter is someone that is awkard with his affections, not comfortable with the lights on when making love. But Kitty wants passion, and is eager for someone to give that to her.

He does finally get to express his passion, as he and Kitty's relationship builds, as they start seeing each other for who they are, the realization  that they love the qualities in each other, as they discover one another's identities.

It is such a wonderful thing to visibly SEE the two of them, change the the way they SEE each other, to watch them fall in love.

All the parts were well played, and vital to the movie. I loved Waddington, and his part as a friend to the Fane's and love to his companion, who also played well.

The actor that played as Kitty's guard was really great, he was so natural.

The one that spoke with the warlord, was super, his part was very well written, very clever, and he was perfect, I loved his part. His whole role is very believable.

The reason that I titled this Old fashioned, was because the wonderful older movies didn't end with ""happily ever after"" every time. Like Casa Blanca. Just a really good drama.  Highest recommendations.",1179360000,,1719,4.588235294117647

Lead actors Edward Norton and Naomi Watts must've seen ...something in the film's script that brought them on-board not only as actors, but also as producers. In no small part is the success of this film due to these two but also because of the setting: China.

This was a huge bonus, something that struck me as effortless artwork on his part.

The script itself also seems effortless in subject matter, but it is this slightness that gives the entire production an amazing quality not normally seen in films. This story covers the lives of Kitty (Naomi Watts,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B000ICM5VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>, 2005) and Walter (Edward Norton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist/dp/B000K7VHQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illusionist</a>), a married couple with a stolid marriage. Kitty is the spoiled rich girl of an elitist family. Her mother hopes to marry her off to a somewhat well-off husband and when Walter, an infectious disease specialist, arrives on the scene, Kitty and he are thrown together in 1925 London. A marriage quickly ensues. But when Walter gets transferred to Shanghai, cracks in their relationship begin to show as Kitty finds excitement in the arms of another man, a married diplomat named Charlie (Liev Schreiber,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Manchurian-Candidate/dp/B0006210ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Manchurian Candidate</a>, 2004). When Walter finds out about it, he does something wildly unexpected: he moves himself and Kitty into China's cholera epidemic. With Walter's threat of divorce and ridicule hanging over Kitty's head, she accepts his move ...especially after learning that Charlie (her paramour) doesn't care for her like she thought he did.

Kitty's lack of love for Walter hits him hard and he buries himself in his work once they arrive at the cholera-infected town. He transfers his love for his wife into his love for his work, caring for the sick and dying (especially the children) while riding recklessly through the disease-riddled area. He quickly encounters battles with the townsfolk who believe his coming there was a bad omen. Eastern superstition battles Western medicine and with the assistance of a communist soldier names Colonel Yu (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang), he forms a tenuous relationship between slowing the epidemic and helping maintain the Chinese culture.

Kitty soon learns that Walter is becoming more and more respected in the area, and she eventually volunteers to help care for the sick too (without Walter's knowledge, initially). Distant husband and lonely wife begin seeing each other during their treatment, and each learns much about the other. Walter finds that he can forgive his wife for her infidelity and for his own mismanagement of their marriage. Kitty grows up and learns that being the wife of a respectable doctor isn't such a bore after all. Love grows, but like a beautiful flower, it is often most fragrant and colorful right before it dies.

The ending sequence between Watts and Norton are what great film is all about. The lighting, the acting, the set, the crushing emotion, all play a pitch-perfect role.

The Painted Veil stars Ed Norton as Walter Fand and Naomi Watts as Kitty Fand.  The story begins in 1920 England where Kitty is being pressured to find a husband by her mother and father.  After the dance they shared Walter Fane is convinced Kitty should become his wife.  They wed only a few days after meeting.

Walter Fane takes his new bride to Shanghai China where he works as a bacterilogist.

3377256,4,B001589S0E,"THE PAINTED VEIL is based on a W. Somerset Maugham novel and a remake of a 1934 MGM romance starring Greta Garbo.  Exquisitely photographed all over China in Panavision by Stuart Dryburgh and with a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat, both of whom should have richly received Oscar nominations here, the new movie starts with an act of adultery in 1925 London.  Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts who also produced) cheats on doctor husband Walter (Edward Norton who was also a producer here) with married diplomat lover Charlie (Liev Schreiber).  In a simmering rage, Walter wants to divorce Kitty, but then has a more vicious revenge for her:  join him as they fight a cholera epidemic in a remote Chinese village.

The movie is long, slow, languid, with some of the most beautiful scenery and photography of at least the last decade in movies.  Kitty is a proud feminist, while Walter seems to hate his wife.  He ignores her, initially displays no love for her.  So Kitty goes off on her own to explore the cholera village.  She runs into Christian missionaries (one of whom is an unrecognizable, but excellent Diana Rigg).  Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are wondrous in these main roles, probably better than Garbo and Herbert Marshall in the 1934 original film.

But then Walter sees that Kitty is coming alive in helping the cholera victims; he comes out of his own shell in graphic hospital scenes as a doctor.  The two make love as husband and wife passionately, and Kitty gets pregnant.  But the father appears to be her married diplomat lover from reel one.  What happens next?

3377259,5,B001589S0E,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I came to this film: a standard period drama perhaps. I'd heard mixed reviews, a lackluster trailer, and it was overlooked by the awards bodies in 2006, but I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the film and the performances in particular.

Nothing about this film is fast or surprising really. We know essentially who our characters are in the first 5 minutes, Walter meets Kitty at a party and asks her to dance. The next day he proposes and she accepts. We know he proposes because he is a rational, intelligent man, used to organization and reason. He falls in love with Kitty suddenly and without reason, but the only way he knows how to respond is to act on it. He's a doctor going to Shanghai to study a cholera epidemic and he loves her- the reasonable thing to do is to marry her and take her with him. She accepts his proposal to get as far away from her mother as humanly possible.  The pair are obviously mismatched. Kitty likes Walter well enough but she's a fun loving girl, slightly shallow, fond of gossip, games, dancing and theater. He's an intellectual who is socially awkward. It's not surprising that Kitty has a fling with another Englishman in Shanghai. Walter finds out and is naturally devistated. He offers Kitty a respectable, quiet divorce only if her lover agrees to marry her. He doesn't. As a sort of punishment for her adultery Walter volunteers to serve as a doctor for a small inland village ravaged by cholera. Kitty is to come with him. What is intended as a punishment turns out to be their salvation.

All we need to know about the nature of the characters is established in the first 45 minutes of the film. We're told little but shown everything. With a smile Kitty shows us she's not always genuine, she enjoys a party but has a two faced side to her. In handing a gift to Kitty, Walter shows us his awkwardness, his kindness, and his fear of the woman he loves. As soon as he says he's an epidemiologist we know he's passionate about is work. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton subtly convey every emotion of their characters by their tone of voice, the ways they stand in one anothers presence. Neither has a meldramatic scene or a grand declaration but they exhibit the heights of human emotions.

Ultimately the actions of other characters, and imperialism itself are viewed through the lens of each character. Kitty sees nuns taking care of the children in an orphanage and says how wonderful they are. Walter says, that yes, the children benefit but Kitty should also keep in mind that the nuns are not totally altrustic: they pay the families of children to give them their babies so they can raise them as Catholics. The children are cared for and protected but also denied their culture. The film itself presents these concerns but doesn't pass judgement. That is left up to the viewer.

Also particuilarly worthy of note are the settings, the stunning backgrounds of China's mountains and rivers. The lush greenery is shot with somewhat muted tones. Alexandre Desplat's score compliments the muted visuals of the film. It's subdued and evocative with occasional Asian influences sprinkled throughout.

The Painted Veil is one of those films where more than one aspect is well above average and that elevates the film as a while. This isn't a Merchant-Ivory film but it could pass for one: the beautiful visuals, excellent performances, amd strong score recall literary adaptations such as Howard's End or A Room With A View.",1179014400,,3517,4.701298701298701
3377260,2,B001589S0E,"I have no idea how these reviewers could give this more than an average 4 star rating. Where do we begin...hmmmm.  How about the missing chemistry between the actors--not just the missing sexual chemistry, as it is a story of a mismatch (and by the way, mismatches in real life never become more than that) but it is as if they are in completely different movies.

 Naomi Watts did not pull off the psych-sexual guilt-desire slave well, and then the rebuff renders her as flat as a pancake.  She's like a half-character wandering around looking for a personality to jump into.

I won't give away more than that, don't think this is a spoiler.  The other thing, perhaps Americans are very tolerant of bad English accents, but Norton's ""Brit"" was fake--it drove me nuts.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to be an American taking on a British accent, then do it like Meryl Streep or shut the hell up.

Further to the botched accent, Norton was oddly wooden...not in a stuck up high soceity sort of way either, but stiff, reflexive, rote.  Ordinarily, I expect great things of Edward Norton, who remains on my top 10 actor list, as soon as he comes to his senses, stops producing vanity projects and gets into some real meat--I'm used to depth from this young man.

In short, the entire film hangs on the performance of Watts and Norton, and both are in their own universes.  I would like to say more about the lousy screenplay but that would give the piece away.  Maugham is probably spinning in his grave, or digging deeper.  Both Norton and Watts are listed as producers... wow, how incredibly ironic that is.",1178928000,,1607,4.5964912280701755
3377261,4,B001589S0E,"Though some readers who are familiar with the novel, 'The Painted Veil', may have quibbles about the altered sequences and places of action and character emphasis in Ron Nyswaner's screenplay, those disparities pale in comparison to the superb acting and cinematic treatment of Maugham's story about the development of love in the most unlikely situation.  John Curran directs his superb cast with fluid movement, allowing the story to unfold in flashbacks in a manner suggestive of the longing and the nightmares of dreams.

Bacteriologist physician Dr. Kane (Edward Norton) is devoted to his work, and part of his work is to quickly marry so that he may proceed with his obsession with his career.  In London he is introduced to the reluctant Kitty (Naomi Watts), a lass who continues to look for the perfect love of her life, but is confronted with reality when her father demands she marry. Kitty is not attracted to Dr. Kane but agrees to marry him and soon they are off to China.  While in Shanghai (no, not Hong Kong) Kitty is bored until she meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) who, though married and a man of public image, sweeps Kitty off her feet.  Their affair is discovered by Dr. Kane and he insists that Kitty either follow him to a small village in interior China, a town besieged by cholera, or go public with a divorce.  Kitty turns to her lover Charlie who refuses to divorce his society wife and Kitty sadly follows her husband to the sick village.

Once settled in the village the couple is befriended by a fellow British gentleman Waddington (Toby Jones) and while Dr. Kane works devotedly with his patients and his epidemiological efforts to stem the cholera, Kitty finds refuge with a group of nuns who care for the children of the dead.  The Mother Superior (Diana Rigg) helps Kitty to adjust and to see the inherent good in her husband, a man who is not only a fine physician but also able to accept the fact that his once disconsolate wife is pregnant, probably as a result of her dalliance with Charlie Townsend.  As the couple begin to accept and appreciate each other the disease strikes home and the story ends with evidence of inner growth in everyone involved.

Norton, Watts, Jones, and Rigg are radiant in their understated roles - Norton's English accent is superb.  The beauty of the film is due in a large part to the beauty of the landscapes of China, but also in an equal part to the eloquent cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh and the musical score composed by Alexandre Desplat (with a nod to Satie) and played by pianist Lang Lang.  The film is as soft in appearance as a painted veil and the mood it creates lingers - even for those who prefer the written version! Grady Harp, May 07",1178755200,,2731,4.666666666666667

""The Painted Veil"" is old school, not just because it is based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel, but also because this 2006 movie has sensibilities more akin to the Hollywood of the 1930s (when the movie was first filmed with Greta Garbo and Herbert Marshall), than of today.  There was a story in the news this week about a controversial and racy billboard in Chicago that proclaimed ""Life's short. Get a divorce.""  The billboard was taken down after a week, over the objections of the two divorce attorneys who put it up, but there is no denying that divorces have become a lot more popular since Maugham's day (the high water marked was 1980 in the U.S. when the divorce rate topped out at 41%).  I bring this up because ""The Painted Veil"" is about two people who do not get divorced, and not because they are staying together for the sake of the children, because there are not any children.  It is a love story, but one of the most unromantic ones that I have ever seen, which is, rather surprisingly, not a bad thing.

Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts) is the daughter of an unambitious solicitor whose inflated idea of herself has seen her reject all possible suitors.  But when her younger sister marries and her mother (Maggie Steed) asks pointedly how long she intends to live off of her father, the confluence of events compels her to accept the marriage proposal of Walter Fane (Edward Norton), a young bacteriologist who is heading off to China.  This is hardly the foundation for a marriage and in Hong Kong the bored Kitty ends up having an affair with Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber).  When Walter discovers the affair he agrees to let Kitty divorce him if Townsend will divorce his wife and agree to marry Kitty.  When Townsend refuses Kitty is stunned, and with nowhere else to go she follows Walter as he volunteers to deal with a cholera epidemic in the interior of China.  It is there that the husband and wife find themselves changing.

The title of ""The Painted Veil"" is taken from a sonnet by Percy Bysshe Shelley, the opening sestet of which is quoted above, and I find it insightful that Maugham's characters do not take the poet's advice.  Almost of as much interest as what is happening between Walter and Kitty is the way he comes to understand that all of his scientific and medical knowledge is of no value if he cannot persuade the locals how to deal with the epidemic.  This is a minor part of the story, and it is the omnipresent threat of cholera that is of more importance to the way things work out in ""The Painted Veil,"" but still a nice little critique of the arrogance of Europeans in dealing with the Third World in the screenplay by Ron Nyswaner (""Philadelphia"").

Director John Curran (""We Don't Live Here Anymore"") was able to film the entire movie in China, but the beautiful vistas shot by Stuart Dryburgh (""The Piano"") serve as the setting for the story and never overwhelm it the way that usually happens in a David Lean epic.  The performances by the main characters, including Toby Jones as Waddington and Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior, are uniformly understated in keeping with the cultured reserve of their characters, and that may well explain why my appreciation for the moment of mutual redemption for Kitty and Walter is more intellectual than emotional.  Of course, back in the day this story was probably as much of a stiff-upper lip tearjerker as you were going to find in literature.

Final Note: The only extra you will find on this DVD is a trailer for the movie, but unless I have gone completely insane this is a different trailer than the one I saw on other DVDs that inspired me to check out this movie.  This one gives away specific details regarding the characters and plots that I do not remember seeing in that other trailer, which is why I was able to get into this movie with no expectations beyond that indicated by the presence of Norton, Watts and company that this film was going to take the high road (Update: I found that other trailer on another DVD and, indeed, it gives away very little of the story, which is much more effective than the one accompanying the actual movie).",1178755200,,4433,4.61704834605598
3377264,4,B001589S0E,"Based on M. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name, ""The Painted Veil"" explores a young couple's desperation and self-loathing that lead to self-discovery amid the lovely countryside and civil unrest of 1925 China. Kitty (Naomi Watts) was a London party girl who couldn't settle on a husband, much to her parents' chagrin. Family pressures and the opportunity to one-up her sister finally convinced Kitty to accept the proposal of a rather serious, bookish, and smitten bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton). Not her type. But they are shortly off to Shanghai, China, where Walter manages a government laboratory. Petulant, bored, and accustomed to being indulged, Kitty has an affair with conspicuously charming Vice Consul Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber). In anger, Walter insists that his wife accompany him to the interior of China, where he has volunteered to work at a hospital that is being deluged by the worst cholera epidemic in years.

Something is lacking in the attraction between these two characters, even as the emotional distance between them lessens. But what Walter and Kitty lack in chemistry, they make up for in gripping mutual and self-hatred. They do more than tempt fate to punish them; they compete to be the most brazenly self-destructive. The credit is mostly due Edward Norton, who imbues Walter's self-loathing with the calculated ferocity of a normally careful man who is deeply wounded. Kitty's desperate boredom and isolation in the countryside force her gaze inward. The chaotic, threatening eruption of disease and anti-foreign sentiment push the couple together. ""The Painted Veil"" has a anti-colonial air which might be misleading given Chiang Kai-Shek's  distaste for striking workers and his complex relationship with the Treaty Ports. But Walter's efforts to help peasant populations in spite of themselves comments on the double-edged sword of third world intervention. The intriguing milieu bolsters the film's inconsistently compelling emotions to create a successful character drama.

3377265,5,B001589S0E,"Years ago, I traveled in China and fell in love with her people and landscape. The Chinese setting, as well as the acting of Edward Norton (one of my generation's finest), led to my viewing of ""The Painted Veil."" I knew nothing of the story and came into it with no expectations.

The film starts with a marriage of expedience between a quiet, intelligent bacteriologist (Norton) and a British sophisticate (Naomi Watts), who wants to escape the clutches of her overbearing family. Norton's Dr. Fane leads Watts' Kitty to Shanghai, where Kitty slumps into a life of loneliness and self-absorption. The end result is an affair with another civil servant. But Dr. Fane is well aware of his wife's dalliances, eventually presenting her with a double-edged choice.

Kitty's self-made prison and Dr. Fane's equally imprisoning lack of forgiveness land the unloving couple in the middle of a cholera epidemic in a remote Chinese district. Through their duty to the sick, they come to truce of sorts, which evolves into unexpected grace.

With beautiful cinematography as a background for the subtle brilliance of Watts and Norton, ""The Painted Veil"" drew me slowly, quietly into its story. It moved me to tears. It made me laugh. And it served as a reminder of the core values which can serve as a foundation for any great work--whether it be in an orphanage, a hospital, a foreign country, or in the treacherous landscape of marriage.",1178668800,,1429,4.921161825726141
3377266,4,B001589S0E,"W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel had been made into films twice before actor-producer Edward Norton attempted it one more time. What they've made is a scrumptious, passionate film for the thinking crowd.

Kitty (Watts) is a bored socialite in London who has a romantic notion about marriage. Walter Fane (Norton) is a serious biologist who has been secretly in love with Kitty for years. Before Walter sets sail to Shanghai for a research post, he proposes to Kitty, who promptly laughs him off, because she simply doesn't love him. When Kitty's younger sister announces her wedding plans, out of embarrassment and the desire to move away from her parents, Kitty hastily accepts Walter's proposal.

In Shanghai, the Fanes lead rather separate lives. Walter immerses himself in work and neglects his bored wife. Meanwhile, Kitty falls for married diplomat Charlie Townsend (Schreiber). When Walter finds out about the affair, he gives Kitty an ultimatum: either go with him to a small village in the middle of a cholera epidemic, or face the scandal of a divorce on grounds of infidelity. Kitty has no choice but follow her husband.

Once at the village, Walter devotes all his time to his work, trying to find ways to contain the disease. His contempt for his wife is evident. Kitty befriends a former British commissioner, Waddington (Jones), a hedonistic man who serves as her only link to the world she once knew. Eventually, Walter and Kitty get to know each other better, and grow to care about each other while facing the horrific epidemic and the turbulent political climate in China.

Naomi Watts (King Kong) is completely believable as the complex Kitty, and she goes through a wide range of emotions and growth with conviction. In the beginning, she's naive, selfish, and confused. By the end she's mature and responsible and loving. The transformation is natural and she does a fine job letting us see deep into her character's soul. Edward Norton (The Illusionist) has the opposite challenge. His character starts off as being serious, arrogant, and dispassionate. We can empathize with Kitty's straying, given how little in common they have. By the end, Norton has given us a warm and great, altruistic man, and we can see how Kitty would fall deeply in love with him by then.

The supporting cast is superb. Toby Jones (Infamous) plays Waddington with humor, warmth, and earnestness. We form certain prejudices against his character, but his portrayal ultimately leaves us with the impression that he's a good guy. Dianna Rigg (Heidi) is delightful as Mother Superior of a convent in the village, offering comfort and wisdom to both Kitty and the audiences. And Hong Kong star Anthony Wong has an affecting turn as Colonel Yu, whose skepticism of the ""foreigners"" turns into genuine admiration.

Writer Ron Nyswaner (Philadelphia) has done a good job adapting the novel. He expands the cultural, social, and political elements of the story while keeping the focus on the relationship between the two leads. The historical backdrop and the cultural aspects of the story are fascinating. What transpires is a rich, multilayered character-driven story that feels real and relevant. The dialogue is sparse but insightful, the relationships between these characters are complex and flawed, and the themes and subtexts are moving.

Director John Curran (They Don't Live Here Anymore) has a grand vision for this film. The sets, the costumes, the production designs are spot on. The Painted Veil is also one of the few recent American films actually shot on location in China, and that gives the film a marvelous realism. Stuart Dryburgh's (The Beautiful Country) cinematography is gorgeous -- a definite feast for the eye. And Alexandre Desplat's (The Queen) scrumptious score complements the film perfectly, giving it a romantic yet despondent feel.

With its delicate production, stellar performances, deft direction, a smart script, and a poignant ending, The Painted Veil harks back to the golden days of Hollywood. It is one of these rare, old-fashioned romantic dramas that delight the senses and nurture the hearts and minds.

The soundtrack...melts me just listening to it...I still cry when hearing #5.  This movie was just beatiful, it spells out life perfectly.  We come to learn from our mistakes and grow to see new beauty from them.  Anyone who didn't like this movie or picks apart of the characters for their individual flaws is materialistic, Wake Up!

3377269,5,B001589S0E,"If you like a story that deals with the basics of human experience---what love is and what it is not... you will enjoy this film.  If you want lots of noise, speed and sensation, rush down to your  local Cineplex where you'll find lots of trash that will satisfy your taste.

We see how the main characters are thrown together by circumstances and how their decisions shape their lives.  I didn't read the novel so I can't comment on how well the film adapts it but I found it to be very complete and satisfying, which is not always the case when a screenwriter has to cram hundreds of pages into into a two hour script.

You can tell that this was a labor of love for Ed Norton, whose performance as the repressed doctor is perfect.  His character is awkward and shy, more at home in a laboratory than at a party.  He is hardly attractive and so is powerfully attracted to his opposite--a beautiful, careless socialite who has nothing on her mind other than disliking her dreadful mother. Her mother forces her marry, or be cut off from support, so having no other option in sight,  she accepts the proposal of this hapless doctor.

A recipe for disaster! They go to China, where she is temporarily distracted, by another expatriot, a charming, married fellow, who possesses all the excitement that her poor husband lacks and they soon fall into something like love.  When her husband discovers her affair he forces her to accompany him  to rural China, where cholera is ravaging the population.  Wow!  If she thought life back in London was a bummer, this brings misery to a whole new level!

Besides cholera, there is political unrest, so danger presents itself on all sides.  She and her husband soon detest each other and she tries to contact her ex-lover to rescue her.  Alas! she learns that she was only one of a string of dalliances that this cad had indulged in.

I won't divulge the rest of the story.  See this and enjoy it for yourself!

Naomi Watts' performance equals Norton's and they are fascinating to watch as each of them evolves. The shots of China are lovely without being overwhelming. This is a perfectly satisfying movie on all levels.",1175644800,,2160,4.592689295039165

This was a beautiful film - the scenery, soundtrack, and script all move to the same lulling pace, making this a character-driven story (albeit one lush enough to get lost in visually). The problem for me was that I didn't particularly like any of them - in fact, there is a brief scene with the Mother Superior where she reveals her own ""tainted love affair,"" and I found the energy of her too-short story more remarkable than anything we saw on-screen.

Perhaps I'm out of step, but when Norton's character shouted ""If you interrupt me again I will strangle you!"" to his wife, virtually everyone in the theater laughed except me. As revenge for her unfaithfulness, he drags his wife (Watts) - over land and without any inoculation - to a cholera stricken village in rural China. While we learn that he, too, has refused to be inoculated (he is searching for an excuse to die, seemingly), the fact does nothing to temper or mediate his cold and calculating vengeance. Through various twists and turns of the script we're told that he doesn't hate her, he hates himself, ""for every having allowed myself to love you once,"" but it is unconvincing. The bitter penalty he longs to exact is nothing short of her death - even later when he's beginning to care about her he refrains from suggesting protection from the disease. I was unable to conjure any sympathy for him throughout.

The fact that his wife then falls for him, that their love blooms in this remote and far-off land, is perhaps not unsurprising (what else is there to do?) but it is a little shocking that he saves his apology for his dying breath. And that she tolerates so little so willingly for so long.

Some reviewers are making a fuss about the actors' silly accents, but they don't distract from the film at all - and it is a good film. In all reality a very enjoyable one, whether you share my considerations or instead find the love story moving and romantic. But some serious questions regarding social issues about men, women, marriage, love, and hate linger long afterwards.",1172275200,,2068,4.673076923076923
3377272,5,B001589S0E,"Co-produced and co-starring Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, W. Somerset Maugham's novel comes to life in living color.  Beautiful cinematography and symphonic music embellish a wonderful, heart-warming story of love and forgiveness.

Kitty (Watts) is getting older.  Living in 1920's London, her parents have more to say with impunity about her suitors.  Quick to pursue her, Walter Fane (Norton) pushes himself for courtship against her wishes, but the timing leaves her no choice but wedlock.  Interrupted in their social life, they become a foursome with Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) and his wife.  Charlie, a virile alternative to her drab, doctor husband, tempts her into adultery.  In such an arrangement, women didn't have the freedoms they do now.  So when Walter is assigned to treat a cholera epidemic in Shanghai,  he's privy to her affair and can blackmail her to come along or face the scorn of divorce.  Since her lover is a playboy who abhors attachment anyway, she again has no choice.

Life in China at first offers nothing more than disease and disenchantment.  Bored with her life and keeping in seclusion to avoid cholera, her husband spreads nothing but flinty resentment toward her unfaithful presence.  Besides a stunning landscape, she discovers a convent where a wise, old mother superior charms her heart and inspires her to do at first repellant work with the orphans.  Besides the dangers of disease, the locals are slow to warm up to any foreigner's presence, even one that may offer a solution to their health crisis.

More moving than its beautiful cinematography, Norton's and Watt's splendid performances work well with a captivating story of lust and love, betrayal and forgiveness, and selfishness turned to self-giving.  While some viewers may find some of the old-fashioned elements of the film languorous in places, I feel the picture clocks in just right for the state of affairs.  Superbly crafted, 'Painted Veil' is complete with a heart-melting beauty for the soul as well as for the eyes.",1171152000,,2035,5.13677811550152

The Painted Veil is an outstanding example of such a versatlie story. The movie brilliantly narrates the lives of a couple who marry to pursue conflicting goals and end up uniting in every way. Ed Norton and Naomi Watts deliver one of the best performances of their lives and leave the audience spell bound in a movie that boasts of nothing dramatic and yet is a drama in the purest form. Set in England and China of 1920's, this movie depicts the love, the lack of it, and again the love between a couple whose pursuits were different but led them to one goal. To sum it, The Painted Veil is a sedate, sober and yet stunningly beautiful movie that will engage and enthrall you.",1170633600,,830,4.503311258278146

3377275,5,B001589S0E,"To be honest, I might not have seen this film if it hadn't been playing at the right theater at a convenient time.  Sure, I was aware of the source material, and I generallly enjoy the actors involved.  But I'd have easily missed it.

The plot essentials: Kitty marries Walter simply to get away from her stubborn, small-minded parents, who have given up on her.  Walter, a doctor doing research in China, is all head and no heart.  Kitty is all heart and no head.  Not a good match.  Once they get to China, Kitty quickly has an affair.  When Walter finds out, he offers a choice: immediate divorce, which would be scandalous, or she follows him to a cholera ridden region.  It quickly seems clear that this is Walter's way of trying to kill her.

And this is just the beginning.  Obviously, there's a lot of melodrama here, yet the movie underplays everything.  There are no grand speeches, no spectacular fights.  And the two main characters are hard to care for, given that they only seem half there: Walter completely lacking emotion or the ability to converse, Kitty foolishly believing that romance is substance.  So what's remarkable is that the audience sort of falls in love with this pair, just as they, unexpectedly, fall in love, eventually, with each other.  This is tricky, and most filmakers would make a big, cheesy deal of the moment when their feelings finally come clear.  That it is a smaller moment here makes it even more touching.

I'm sure there are some people who rather the big, noisy version of this story, with the characters turned more sympathetic, and cues telling us how we should feel.  Not me.  I admired the fact that the director and screenwriter trusted me enough to understand things on my own.

There were only two small things that didn't work for me: the timeline of events is confusing, not because of flashbacks, but simply because it is hard to tell how much time has passed.  And the final scene, in which we find out ""what happened next"", is totally unneccessary.",1169337600,,2011,4.65625
3377276,1,B001589S0E,"It's obvious The Painted Veil is geared to people who are fairly educated. Baltimore is a fairly large city, and only one small theater that I'm aware of showed this movie! So I find it hard to believe the filmmakers, in their infinite wisdom, needed to show extremely graphic images of people dying of Cholera, not to mention grotesque scenes of corpses, to the very people who already have a pretty good idea about what dying from Cholera is all about.

As a result of being caught off guard by these rather gruesome images, I literally lost my dinner after the movie was over. Where do I send the bill? Can anything be left to the imagination, anymore? Why are so many films these days so morbid? Is the movie going public becoming so desensitized that nothing is shocking? Are American filmmakers helping to turn us into a nation of mindless voyeurs? If I wanted, or needed, to learn more about Cholera, all I have to do is hop on the Internet, or God-forbid, pick-up a book, and read. I didn't need to spend my hard earned money to be nauseated!

All I can say is thank God for the scientist who invented the purification process for public drinking water - he should be nominated for sainthood! And the next time you gripe about your Government spending money on foreign aid in very poor countries, keep this movie in mind! For Cholera still kills plenty of people in the developing world, each, and every day - because a huge segment of the human race still does not have access to safe drinking water!

3377277,4,B001589S0E,"The Painted Veil is yet another Edward Norton period drama, complete with a lushness and beauty that no one can create but contemporary film. Wow, does this movie look good. The fields, the haze, the villages, the river, the furniture and mud all reek of the real stuff. It is gorgeous to look at, with a graceful musical score that lovingly enhances the story. Details are great. It looks as good as it could.

So where does it not quite measure up? Heart. A film with two cold and self-absorbed main characters needs some potent chemistry to overcome the inherent off-putting-ness of such remote protagonists. And this movie didn't do accomplish that. She is a silly, childish whiner, easily manipulated by a shark who adds another notch to his bedpost. He is cocky and cold, remote and though apparently inflamed with lust, unable to show it. Now, this chilliness is important for the story, as they must grow and overcome the huge obstacles they have built for themselves. But it also makes them harder to care about, making a cerebral, rather than visceral, experience.

But the slow pacing and the gradual changes, while all plausible and consistent, somehow just felt too small for so much buildup. There are several good themes explored here: beauty is not a good reason for love; those who claim to want us will say whatever they need to say to get what they want; you can love virtue far more than looks; service and occupation fill a life as amusements cannot. These are all things Kitty realizes that she would never have learned had she remained a 1920s English Valley girl. But it was just too little for the knockout such material could have provided. Worth watching. Just somewhat disappointing.",1168300800,,1711,4.796610169491525
