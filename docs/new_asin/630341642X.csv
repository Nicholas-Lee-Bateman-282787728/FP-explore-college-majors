651480,5,630341642X,"I originally saw this film on HBO, and was instantly riveted to it.  It kind of reminds me of an offbeat version of L A Confidential, with all the elements of the 40's and such.  I love L A Movies and the scenes here in this film depict much of the unusual architecture, and ambience, that encompass and make up this little ""boulubaise"" of cultures, and personalities.  Besides starring Dennis Hopper, it also features Sheryl Lee Ralph, of dream girls fame, and the superb cameo, but nonetheless great acting of Lypsinka, as the the mysterious Madame, of the bordello.  (Looking fabulous, I might add, in vintage Charles James Couture.............)  I recommend buying it , and viewing it with friends, over some , sour apple martini's and appetizing shrimp hor'dourve.  /the movie is a little offbeat, but that in itself is the appeal of this wonderful film.",991612800,19,859,4.8493150684931505
651481,1,630341642X,"...but this movie was pretty stupid.  I believe it was trying to be funny, but it was really hard to tell.  I actually sat through the whole thing though.  That's time I'll never get back...",920851200,,190,4.371428571428571
651614,5,630341642X,"I spent years trying to locate this movie. Many years ago I saw just the end of this film and wished I seen it from the beginning but it never was shown again on the channel.  Over the years, I tried to get this movie but didn't even know its name except it had to do with witchcraft and Hollywood.  I knew it was with Dennis Hopper but couldn't locate it in any of his film biographies.  Finally my one son told me the name of this elusive film.  [He is a film fan and knew I was trying to locate this movie for years and came across the name in a magazine.] I was so very lucky to find it on Amazon, although it is on VHS and not DVD, the movie was still well worth the viewing. It has a very unusual story line which I found to be fascinating. In fact I even bought the follow up film with Fred Ward.  After so many years [approx 14] of searching, Amazon came through with a contact to purchase this long sort after movie.  Thanks to both the vendor and Amazon.",1349049600,6,964,3.9947916666666665
651615,4,630341642X,"Give the producers of this movie a 5 star plus on ambition for attempting to create a world (in LA, specifically) where magic (spells, curses, time shifts, zombies as bodyguards, etc.) is very real and a part of everyday life, and combining it with the late 1940's/ early 1950's hard boiled film noir private detective genre (with Dennis Hopper in lead role). Wow!

I was attracted to many elements in the plot, and generally liked this movie, so I give it a 4 star rating overall.

On the down side, the movie seemed a little flat at times, and tried to combine murders with a little comedy, in a way that was a little awkward sometimes. There was also a very tedious subplot where an evil politico is portrayed as a McCarthy/ HUAC-like crusader against the occult community who uses magic in everyday life. Also, the viewer is asked to suspend belief in many obvious plot flaws that would exist if magic spells were a fact of everyday life with everyday people.

This HBO movie is a follow-on to another HBO movie, ""Cast a Deadly Spell"" (with different actors, but same fictional setting) which I, unfortunately, haven't watched yet, so I can't comment on that.

But, for ""Witch Hunt"" if one just relaxes, sits back, accepts the premises of the plot and just watches to see where it will go, this can be a very enjoyable and bizarre ride. An aged Dennis Hopper with slick backed hair trying to solve a murder mystery, shiny classic cars being driven around LA, people casting spells to shrink things, and bring people thru time, a creation of a post art deco/ ""Chinatown"" -like LA that never existed, curses being placed and lifted all over---wow, where else can you see this?

For those who like these things, and like cult films, and are willing to overlook some problems, this is a good watch.

A caution---I had to watch it 2 or 3 times to pick up everything happening, but I like films like this, too. Some of you may not.",1347408000,4,1929,4.5606936416184976
651616,4,630341642X,"This 1995 film is a loosely-based sequel to a previous HBO production, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-a-Deadly-Spell/dp/6302233941/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast a Deadly Spell</a>"" starring Fred Ward, one of my all-time favorite character actors. And while I have to admit at preferring Fred's original take on the character, ber talent Dennis Hopper took Private Detective H. Phillip Lovecraft into a different, more subtle, but equally enjoyable direction; one that makes for an interesting contrast when both performances are seen back-to-back.*

As before, our favorite gumshoe has his mitts caught in twisted tale of power and intrigue with elements of dark magic woven throughout. And what does a hardened street-smart detective do in a world filled to the brim with magic? Nothing. He ""doesn't touch the stuff"". He's old school before there was even a school. Awesome!

It's 1953 and the raging political whirlwind du jour: Root out and destroy The Red Menace. With the notable exception that in this alternate history the scare isn't communism - it's magic. As Phil's intro voiceover makes clear: It started small but spread quickly. Seemingly overnight the whole country, from car mechanics to interior decorators, is using magic. From the mundane to the incredibly metaphysical, everyone dabbles.

'Cept Phil.

One of the reasons I enjoy this version more than 'Spell' are the more fully developed side characters. Like psychic bloodhound Trudy, played by the stunning Valerie Mahaffey; a twitchy beauty who regularly drops hints to Phil that she's interested in more than a consulting role in his life. And a more fully developed carryover character from the first film: Hypolita Kropotkin, played to perfection by Sheryl Lee Ralph. Ditto the always enjoyable Julian Sands portraying Irish freakshow and fellow private ""eye"" Finn Macha.

Another reason: The cinematography and art direction are interesting, producing a crisp hyper-reality that captures the '50s vibe and era with style. The closest analog I can think of is the current 'Mad Men' series. Costumes, vehicles and settings that aren't obvious because you naturally accept them as 'right'. Not quite as convincing as '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Confidential/dp/B001CN2WXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. Confidential</a>', which was like stepping through a time machine, but clever enough that you buy the settings and sets, many of which are standing, as authentic.

'Hunt' cleverly blends the story of Hollywood's growing dirty dalliance with politics, then combining it with its notorious dark ability to drain away every drop of energy from an unending stream of wannabe starlets.

A decently fun flick that combines real history and the quirky off-beat unreality of a world where magic is real.

Movie Note:

- Interestingly, Hypolita Kropotkin's character name is spelt differently in each version.

*Sadly, you can chalk this up as yet another lost HBO classic. As well as classic ineptitude on the part of the same.

The reasons are never discussed (I've written to them several times over many years with no reply), but my general understanding is that many of the early productions were, and I'm unfamiliar with the industry business term, rentals. HBO obtained content that was already finished, only purchasing the right to distribute them into their US programming cycles. But beyond those initial runs, long-term reproduction issues were never discussed. And so they sit decades later, lost in movie limbo.

These aren't clunkers and throwaway T&A flicks - we're talking excellent productions with established quality performers like James Caan and Robert Duvall; and include fantastic films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Long-Gone/dp/6301648838/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Long Gone</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poodle-Springs/dp/B00004SC9F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poodle Springs</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-of-Africa/dp/6301651553/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion of Africa</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comrades-of-Summer/dp/630271544X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comrades of Summer</a>"", and this film's predecessor, ""Cast A Deadly Spell"".

One would think the current trend of dead-timer download rentals and burn-one-disc-per-order would only benefit HBO/TimeWarner; cashing in on content that they don't have to repackage, advertise, handle or otherwise do anything with - just a simple negotiation for their release.

But apparently that's asking too much.

The bizarre part in all this: Different regions across the globe have already licensed the content, as many former HBO films have found their digital release in places like the UK, Australia, Germany and even Korea.",1330128000,3,5066,6.438880706921944
651617,5,630341642X,"Great movie using H.P. Lovecraft's mythos in a very humorous and somewhat Film Noir fashion. My only question is when will they get off their butts and make this and ""Cast a Deadly Spell"" (the prequel though not tied to this one) into DVD versions. The prequel won a friggin Emmy and had three nominations. DVD version already like yesterday!",1301875200,2,342,4.716666666666667
651618,4,630341642X,Most people like the first in the series better but this one is my favorite. I like alternate universe stories and the idea that magic is as common as electricity in a modern world is pretty unique. The biggest weakness (other than Dennis Hopper seems to be having problems in his knees and not able to move much)is it is VHS only which does not look all that good on modern large screens.,1283472000,3,389,4.342465753424658
651619,5,630341642X,"Come on HBO, when are you doing to release this and ""Cast a Deadly Spell"" on DVD. There is a cult following for these two films and Lovecraft in general, do it!",1275091200,9,160,4.03125
651620,2,630341642X,"I bought this because it was the sequel to ""Cast a Deady Spell"", which is a brilliant horror/comedy built on themes from H.P. Lovecrafts Cthulhu mythos. ""Witch Hunt"" loses everything that was great about ""Cast a Deadly Spell"", with trivial exceptions like the business card gag. The noir mood and gritty setting is lost completely. Deadly Spell was cool, intelligent and fun, Witch Hunt is campy, heartless and plastic. Nothing about the story really works well when it tries to tie in to the past movie, and it's very disappointing when detective Lovecraft ends up being a magic user by the end of the film. It's a soulless zombie feeding on the corpse of the first movie, and that metaphor is way cooler than anything else about the film itself. If you loved the original movie because of all the H.P. Lovecraft and Cthulhu stuff, you can just go ahead and skip this film, because whoever wrote the script didn't get it.",1257984000,2,922,4.697530864197531
651621,5,630341642X,"I have been waiting for years for this movie to make it to dvd. To say that this movie is quirky is an understatement.
It follows a detective played beautifully by Dennis Hopper as he tries to solve a murder. What is unusual is
that the average Joe uses magic as part of his daily routine,i.e.want to take out your trash,simply think it
and its done or want to be beautiful have someone cast
a spell and its done.
Hopper vehemently refuses to use magic eventhough he knows how. We get to follow him as meets a cast of quirky characters who use magic and try to help him solve the
murder.
Its just a fun movie.

651622,4,630341642X,"When I first saw this movie in the theatres I was immediatly impressed with the idea of magic working itself into everyday life, from cooking to police work.  Loosely based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft (a extraordinary write of the macabre and occult).  This story follows an adventure of a non-magic using detective in a world that takes advantage of magic like the modern man uses technology.
