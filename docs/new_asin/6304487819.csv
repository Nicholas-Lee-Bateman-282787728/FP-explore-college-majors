7874437,4,6304487819,"From the creator of Wicked City and Ninja Scroll comes one of the least exciting of the three. But I must say, it is a very good title. The story revolves around two guys called Biohunters. One is a science teacher who gets involved with students and the other has a horrid case of demon virus. These two help cure people affected by the demon virus. Sometimes, when the need arises, the guy with the virus will use his powers to help out. Soon they are chased by another man with the virus who wants them dead. They also meet Seika. Seika prooves to be quite a love for the demon-virus Biohunter and his partner keeps on boasting. Ofcourse, like Wicked City and Ninja Scroll, there is your creppy old guy, but this one is more inteligent then that of Ninja Scroll and Wicked City. The content, compared to the other two movies, is slimmer, but thats because there is more plot in the story. The dub makes use of the same voice actors from Twilight of Darkmaster. I'd recommend renting this movie first because it might not be good for most people in the long run, but its still a great movie.",982886400,,1093,4.389162561576355
7874438,2,6304487819,"In this particular OAV, two scientist/professors, Komada and Koshigaya are on the trail of a rare virus that is known as the ""the demon virus.""  A few things that complicate their already difficult mission  are three facts.  The first one being that Komada has become infected by  the ""demon virus"" and is running out of time before it consumes  his human soul.  The second fact being that something or some one is  running around Japan and eating the livers of several young women.  The  third being that the young woman who Komada has developed strong feelings  for is kidnapped.
  The story is nothing new from so many anime  stories, the characterization isn't all that believable; however, the art  is very good and so are the voice-overs (Urban Vision tends to due a very  good dubbing job in general).  All in all due to the lack of originality in  the story, the lack of good transitions in some scenes, or the  believability of the characterizations, and the less than satisfactory  ending, I think that two stars is an accurate rating.",950400000,,1045,4.737430167597766
7874439,5,6304487819,"Let's get off on the right foot here, I find it very annoying how everyone compares every single anime to Ninja Scroll. There is no better anime than Ninja Scroll, ever!  There, we've established that so now lets move forward  and view this with an open mind. Imagine present day Tokyo, 4 women dead,  bodies eaten, their live ivers ripped out. It isn't your usual weirdo or  pervert...it's them. Imagine your a professor of molecular biology and  you've discovered a new virus. A virus that turns seemingly normal people  into deranged beast like killers with demonic powers..the ""demon  virus"". It sounds far out to your colleagues but one believes you,  your friend Kumada, and that's because he's been infected by it. It gets  worse..at first it's somewhat of an advantage, he has an extrodinary immune  system which means he can fight off the virus and use it at his will and  transform into a demonic beast and help you in your battle to save lives  and irradicate the virus. But now he's losing control of it, the virus is  winning and to make matters worse a powerful political figure who controls  the police force and has his private gang of machine gun waving thugs hot  on your trail has been infected..and they've got your girl too!  If you  wanna know what else happens i suggest you buy this movie, watch it and  then add it to your top ten anime file right next to Akira and Ninja  Scroll.",947289600,11,1405,4.592741935483871
