8087635,5,B0007XB5CW,"I really like this dvd, I feel like the makeup artist explained things well, and I even picked up a few new techniques myself. I also though it was very well produced and could see well what the artist was doing.  I was carefull with my purchase because someone rated it poorly, however they said the makeup artist was always in the way and they could not view things well.  I took the chance because it had a lot of other high ratings, and figured it could not  be all that bad, glad I did because I found it to be very informative, well made and did not feel like the makeup was ever in the way of being able to see what she was doing.",1497744000,,637,4.0396825396825395
8087636,5,B0007XB5CW,Michelle explains and demonstrates very easy to follow makeup applications.  I have watched other cds and this by far has been the easiest to watch.  I would recommend this cd if you are looking for a professional way to apply your own makeup.,1214611200,,243,4.627906976744186
8087637,5,B0007XB5CW,"I purchased this dvd because I had a special occasion coming up and I wanted to look my best. I've been doing my make-up the same way for a decade and it was looking a bit tired and dated. This dvd gave me great ideas for changing my day to day look and also how to look natural but a bit glammed up for my special occasion. The production is high quality, classy and elegant and the application that is done is very clearly shown. It is 85 mins long and is broken up into sections.

8087638,5,B0007XB5CW,A  friend recommended this video. This video is wonderful. The directions are clear and applicable not only to brides but to anyone wanting to learn more about makeup application. My daughter loved it so much that she had a sleepover with her friends so that they all could learn these techniques.  My sisters and I all watched it so we could update our looks which have been almost the same since college. It was great for everyone in every age group.  I recommend this video to everyone!!!!!!!!!,1128038400,3,497,4.689655172413793

8087641,5,B0007XB5CW,"I purchased the DVD for my daughter and her friends to get ideas about make-up techniques appropriate for their Homecoming Dance.  What a time they had!!  The girls were able to assist each other by using the ""tricks of the trade"" demonstrated in the DVD.  There were 4 teenagers who looked incredible at their Homecoming Dance and they were able to do it all themselves at a fraction of the cost of a professional. The Perfect Wedding series is a must have if you have teenage daughters.",1127952000,6,488,4.586206896551724
8087642,4,B0007XB5CW,I had purchased this for a friend who was getting married but prior to giving it to her I was intrigued by the pkg and some of the techniques it covered.  As someone who isn't very comfortable in applying make up I decided to check it out before passing it along to my friend and I'm SO GLAD I DID!  There were numerous techinques that anyone would find useful.  I especially enjoyed hearing about the eyelash application something I had never tried but always wanted to.  This video really does reach out to a much broader audience then just brides anyone can take something away from watching it.,1127952000,7,598,4.5092592592592595
8087643,1,B0007XB5CW,"I rented this video before I decided to buy it and I am glad I only spend $3.50 to rent! Her instruction and techniques are poor. She moves in front of the camera a lot, which completely blocks the model from view. Also the video is more like a commercial for her products rather than a guide that anyone can use. I would skip the video and hire a trained make up artist.",1127260800,4,371,4.095890410958904
8087644,4,B0007XB5CW,"I have this DVD and realized it would be great for anyone, not just if your are in a wedding!  I plan to loan it to a friend for her daughters PROM.  All the girls can have a night to gather and watch it together.  I make a lot of public apperances and I found this DVD very useful!",1114300800,3,282,3.7457627118644066
