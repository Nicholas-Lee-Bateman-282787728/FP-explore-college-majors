279243,3,6300255980,"I kept thinking while looking at the superb face of the very young James Mason (Lord Rohan) that he would have made a perfect Heathcliff. A very young Stewart Granger ( Peter Rokeby ) also stars in the film as the good guy but Mason upstages him. The film is good enough but has some major faults. The girls at the school where Clarissa ( Phyllis Calvert) and Hesther (Margaret Lockwood) meet all look like they are in their twenties and appear rather silly behaving like school girls giggling as they romp in the snow and build a snowman. Clarissa's page looks like a white boy in black face. Phyllis Calvert  upstages Margaret Lockwood not because she is the film's  good girl but because she is both prettier and a better actress.

The title The Man in Greyis rather strange since the movie is in black and white and consequently everybody is dressed in shades of grey. The plot is simple. The sadistic Marquis marries the sweet but naive Clarissa in order to beget an heir. The schemer Hesther, whom Clarissa considers her best friend, wants both the cruel Baron (they are alike) and Clarissa's place in society. In the wings is Peter Rokeby (Granger) who is Clarissa's knight in shining armor. I feel that Clarissa is extremely dumb not to see the obvious machinations of best friend Hesther and the Marquis amazingly blind to his wife's attributes which are perhaps greater than those of his Mistress Hesther. Oh well. I guess when you get right down to it this movie just isn't my bag. But I could look at James Mason forever.",1412467200,3,1533,4.608058608058608

279246,4,6300255980,"Don`t buy the VHS if it is recorded in the long play mode.  On my copy the picture was not very good with lots of lines and flaws due to tracking problems which are present on most VHS recorded in the EP mode.  If you want the movie, my advice is to order the import DVD, if you can play it. Why spend so much money for the tape when you can get the DVD for just a little more.  I`m sure this VHS is just like mine.",1337126400,4,415,3.6931818181818183
279247,4,6300255980,"The Gainsborough films of the early 1940's cannot be easily dismissed, for although most were featherweight, they were amongst the all-time favourites for audiences during the war.  THE MAN IN GREY (1943) is one of the most fondly-remembered of the Gainsborough titles, the romantic story of a love affair and the machinations which tear it apart.

Lovely, gentle Clarissa Richmond (Phyllis Calvert) strikes up a friendship with Hesther Shaw (Margaret Lockwood) at Miss Patchett's School for Young Ladies.  The two couldn't be more different, for whilst Clarissa is one of Miss Patchett's star pupils and wildly popular thanks to her kind nature; Hesther is moody, sullen and selfish.  Resentful of having to pull herself up by the bootstraps in order to improve her social standing, Hesther has been sent to Miss Patchett's in order to train as a teacher.  When Hesther finally runs away, Clarissa too leaves the school in protest.  Back in London, Clarissa finds herself wed to notorious rake Lord Rohan (James Mason), known by all as ""the man in grey"".  The marriage is loveless from the start - Clarissa is a trophy and all Rohan wants from her is an heir.  Once Clarissa fulfils his wish, she can go about life without him.

An unexpected chain of events leads Hesther - now an actress in a third-rate Shakespearian company - back into Clarissa's life.  Clarissa offers Hesther a permanent place in her household, a tantalising prospect which the greedy Heather grabs with both hands.  Striking up a strong rapport with Lord Rohan, Hesther sets into motion a plan to usurp Clarissa, not only in Rohan's bed, but also as the lady of the manor.  All of this is observed by Peter Rokeby (Stewart Granger), a fellow actor from Hesther's troupe, who falls in love with Clarissa and is determined to protect her from Hesther's devilish plot...

Based on a novel by Eleanor Smith, THE MAN IN GREY is a fun Regency period romance with a little something for everyone - action, comedy, intrigue.  Bookended by an auction set in modern-day (ie: WW2) London where the personal effects of Rohan and Clarissa go under the hammer - and the descendants of Clarissa and Rokeby meet and fall in love - it's also just a wee bit sappy, but in the best sense.  Wartime audiences ate this stuff up.

The performances are sublime - Phyllis Calvert never looked as radiant in any of her later films, and young Stewart Granger displays the matinee idol qualities that would eventually launch him into a popular series of MGM costume swashbucklers in the 1950's.  Margaret Lockwood (Gainsborough's reigning ""Wicked Lady"") and James Mason (""Odd Man Out"") are hissably evil.  And don't we love it?!

Perfect entertainment for a cold and rainy Saturday afternoon.  The current DVD available from Network UK has a well-worn print (lots of damage but still watchable) of the original 112-minute theatrical version (some later prints were chopped down to 90 minutes) plus the 1984 British TV special, ""James Mason: The Man They Loved to Hate"".",1303344000,4,3017,4.913214990138067
279248,4,6300255980,"This is a very atmospheric and haunting version of an excellent Gothic story.  The original book was somewhat different, but both are good and James Mason did a great job with the title role.  Very enjoyable.",1280880000,,208,4.75
279249,3,6300255980,"I think this was the first time I ever laid eyes on James Mason and Stewart Granger, and they were in their prime.  The acting style was crisp British, the costumes were just right, and the story was pretty much as it had been written by one Lady Eleanor Smith, a writer I then proceeded to read every word of, at the age of 13.  I'm sorry that this DVD is in Region  2.  But time will tell.  To the sophisticated of today this will be a laughable film, but to those who can roll in its pseudo-Jane Austen tale-telling, or just wallow in an old fashioned melodrama, this would be a lark.  The heroine has a taste for 'sugared violets.'  The villainous Mason has a taste for the riding whip, and Stewart Granger -- well, one could just eat him with a spoon.  He gets to play an early 19th century Othello in the great 'Put out the light' scene, then smother Margaret Lockwood, the be-all and end-all of 'bad girl' characters in the Arthur Rank films of the 40's.",1199318400,5,961,4.2707182320441985

7807471,5,6300255980,"Wow, this was great!  I thought I'd seen and even purchased every James Mason movie, but  somehow never saw this one before.  No wonder he was such a hit, there was no such anti-hero in movies before.  The story is intriguing, and since the principals aren't too familiar, you can't quite predict the plot turns.  Nice long movie too, perfect for a cold-weather day.  And hints of present-meets-past as well.  Enjoy!  I sure did.",1417564800,2,429,4.702702702702703
7807472,3,6300255980,"James Mason's character is certainly unlikable, but Margaret Lockwood's is just evil. Kind of a strange story. If it's a cold dreary day and you're looking for an old movie to watch while curled up with a comfy quilt... this will work!",1415318400,,235,4.619047619047619
7807473,3,6300255980,"I love moody period films, but this one becomes silly at the end when the character played by Mason kills his mistress because she had killed the wife he never wanted to begin with, except to produce an heir. That part really didn't make sense to me. I'm sure, as evil and callous as he was made out to be, he'd have been delighted to have been free to romp with his mistress, and even to marry her, which he'd claimed all along to want to do. I like the movie, but it's not great, as the plot is really too contrived in every way: the love of Clarissa for Hester, and her inability to detect her scheming machinations; the intensely caricatured selfishness of Hester, who it seems would have felt some tinge of gratitude for a girl who stood by her so staunchly from the moment she met her; the murder of the wife by the scheming mistress and her subsequent demise at the hands of a man who had no reason not to appreciate what she'd done; the sailing away of the lover, who never would have left his love in the hands of man like the baron and the woman he knew was scheming and wicked. This aforesaid lover had just been proclaiming he'd protect Clarissa at all costs, but in one moment he's talked out of taking her with him, only to leave her to her despicable fate. All in all, a third rate movie, and even the title made no real sense, as the anti-hero is referred to only once as the man in grey, and it made no contribution to his character. He wasn't even as evil as one would have expected, so that was anti-climactic as well. The fact that the hero and heroine are supposedly reunited in a later life doesn't make up for the horror of Clarissa's murder, and the whole thing was a bit unsatisfying.",1414022400,,1709,4.2615384615384615
