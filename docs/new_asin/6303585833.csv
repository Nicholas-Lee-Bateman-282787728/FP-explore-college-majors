7901820,3,6303585833,"A great one-of-the-better'60s ""nudie"" film that makes no bones about it being just a vehicle to show lovely women bare as much as was legal at the time, thankfully in a pre-silicone implant era. You gotta love a cast of beauties with names like ""Boobra"", ""Gertie Tassle"" and ""Gigi String"" to name just a few.  Unlike today,  these women manage to look attractive and voluptuous without looking slutty.

Frank A. Coe, who plays the alien, does a so-good-its-uncanny impersonation of Stan Laurel. (He also did the sounds effects and was the Frankenstein monster.)

Outrageous makeup, intentionally overblown character takeoffs (Dr. Breedlove/Strangelove by Max Gardens, also the producer) and groaner quips make for a refreshing change from the strained/crude comedy the industry is pumping out today.

Guys, grab a beer, kick back and laugh/marvel at the innocence of the time.",1345852800,,876,5.273381294964029
