8099643,2,B000CNER18,"Be careful when ordering this package. It is NOT episodes of the fondly remembered and pioneering NBC children's show that ran from 1947 to 1960.

These are episodes from a syndicated attempt to revive the Peanut Gallery in the 1970's.

These shows were taped in Florida and featured a completely redesigned Howdy puppet. While many of the original cast & crew were on hand for this revival, they could not catch lightning in a bottle twice and the show ceased production after only 6 months.

Despite what one reviewer stated, Bob Keeshan does NOT appear in any of these episodes. Lew Anderson plays Clarabell, which is not bad - as Lew also portrayed Doodyville's top clown for the majority of the show's original run. Keeshan was fired way back in 1952 in a salary dispute. It proved to be a blessing in disguise as Bob was quickly hired by rival network CBS where he went on to create Captain Kangaroo, a character that lasted on national television long after Howdy Doody was canceled.",1289260800,7,990,4.710982658959537
