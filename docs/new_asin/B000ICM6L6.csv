2655298,3,B000ICM6L6,"Antarctica Dreaming is a competently produced documentary, but nothing extraordinary. While informative and well shot, this production left a lot to be desired. The narrator's voice is dull, monotone, and wooden. The entire production seemed very mechanical and lacked soul.

If you've had your fill of penguins and walruses over the last few years due to all the documentaries and animations, it's better off to skip this DVD entirely. This is nothing you haven't seen before. In light of the other much more superior penguin/Antarctic animal documentaries produced, like March of the Penguins, or the BBC Planet Earth series, your money is better spent there.

Bad Extras:

The extras include six mini-documentaries. The rest of the options lead to a still screen with text descriptions.",1201564800,7,789,5.296
2655299,5,B000ICM6L6,"The video quality in this title is extremely good. As noted in the review by D. Eidam, there are some minor compression artifacts in some of the darker background shots, but even then the foreground is very good. The selection of content was also very good, none of it seems like it should be on the cutting room floor. The inclusion of some time lapse landscapes of clouds was well done and in many places action is modestly slowed down during action.
The ambient music is very complimentary and does not detract as it has in some of the other HDScape titles.
After Planet Earth, this one is a definite buy (for anyone interested in nature content). If you just want to show off the capabilities of your HDTV, this could also accomplish that, but I'm sure other titles would end up ahead of this one.",1184457600,5,801,4.493150684931507
2655300,5,B000ICM6L6,"This is the best hd dvd i have ever seen. It blows away planet earth and King Kong.  It is simply breathtaking.  I had a little issue on my XA-2 but had it play wonderfully on my xbox hd dvd players.  The scene with the penguins it to cry for, the color details, are simply spectacular. Eye candy, the best kind to show off hd dvd , the best format in the world",1182988800,9,361,3.9178082191780823
2655301,4,B000ICM6L6,"After ordering the HDscape Sampler HD-DVD (something I also purchased & reviewed on Amazon), I decided to take the plunge and order some more videos from HDscape.  One of those videos happens to be Antarctica Dreaming, the one that stuck out the most on the entire sampler to me.  I own the Xbox 360 HD DVD add on, and the video works like a charm.  If it doesn't work properly, make sure you are signed into Xbox Live before starting the video.  A firmware update might need to be installed that fixed menu glitches.

Its a dual format disc, meaning that it can be played on both regular DVD players & HD DVD players.  The total runtime clocks in at just under an hour and a half, and can be viewed as either a nature documentary or an ambient music video with all of the same material.  Contained within is breath-taking scenery and wildlife such as penguins, seals, and seabirds.  It also features 6 additional mini-documentaries totaling a little over a half hour of bouns footage, and other written tidbits about the making of the film.

The video quality of the HD-DVD side ranges from average to above average.  If you already own Planet Earth, know that it isn't better quality than that.  But then again, I like to think of Planet Earth as the best looking HD-DVD to come out so far, so its difficult to compete with something so great.  Antarctica Dreaming certainly has great footage and in some cases, excellent detail, but video issues are apparent if you are looking for them.  Its most noticeable in scenes when it is snowing, and in some of the darker colors.  Don't get discouraged though, it is only on a small percentage of the video and there is still plenty of things to like about the video.  For what it is, I was truly impressed.

The audio seems to be toned down a little bit so that you can hear the commentator and the ambient music better.  The sounds the wildlife make are very quiet and I don't know if its just me, but I would have loved to hear the sounds of nature more clearly than the ambience added.  However, I think HDscape's vision is ambience, as seen from there sampler disc, where all but Antarctica Dreaming are pretty much purely ambient videos.

Overall, I would have to recommend this HD-DVD first over all the HDscape products, as this one serves as both ambient listening, and a nature documentary.  The added bonus footage makes this even a better treat.  If you have kids that liked the movies Happy Feet, March of the Penguins, or the newer Surf's Up, its definitely recommended.  As for a nature documentary enthusiast, pick up Planet Earth first.",1182816000,12,2599,4.568034557235421

8145071,5,B000ICM6L6,"Antarctica is a tough assignment for shooting video, and the modest-sized crew that produced this documentary view of the landscapes and animal residents of the Earth's most remote and hostile continent has done an admirable job. The high-definition video is consistently sharp and well-composed, and the skillful editing creates an enjoyable storyline, presenting 13 chapters over the course of 82 minutes. Beginning with a general introduction to ""The White Continent"", the narrative includes four segments devoted to various penguin species, three dealing with seal species, one covering several species of flying birds (as distinguished from the flightless penguins), three on weather, glaciers and icebergs, and concluding with a chapter entitled ""The Final Passage"". The Final Passage is regarding the Lemaire Channel, and was saved for last because of the breathtakingly beautiful sunrise and sunset effects that the photographers were able to record, providing an upbeat conclusion to a nearly hour-and-a-half tour of the fringes of Antarctica and nearby islands.

The lead review on the product page for this documentary was quite dismissive, but the price was so modest that I took a chance and was rewarded handsomely, and will be ordering additional copies for gifts. The video is first-rate, the original musical accompaniment pleasant and restrained, and the narration calm and informative. A few tiny slips show up in the narration, like referring to weak pack ice (frozen sea water) and brash ice (small broken chunks) as ""icebergs"", but they are few and do not detract from the overall excellence of the presentation. The disc offers the option of playing without the narration, allowing the high quality of the sights, ambient sounds and music to speak for themselves. Try playing the disc once with the narration to introduce you to the cast of characters, then again without the narration.

The series of HD Window releases dates from the beginning of high definition, and the titles are inconsistent in quality. Antarctica Dreaming is one of their very best, and is an unusual bargain that delivers a top quality product without compromise.",1424304000,,2161,5.352941176470588
8145072,4,B000ICM6L6,"It was very good, but in a contest between it and Coral Seas Dreaming, the first one I bought, Coral Seas wins.  the photography is outstanding, music isn't quite as spectacular.  But still very good . ..thanks . ..Leslie",1423785600,,221,4.641025641025641
8145073,5,B000ICM6L6,"The library stole my copy! In fact we have bought a few copies now. Great pictures, informative and moving. This inspires a passion for preserving such a pristine environment.",1391126400,,175,5.068965517241379
8145074,5,B000ICM6L6,"I have had trouble finding a good high-definition video on penguins and ""Antarctica Dreaming"" is probably the best.

It shows Chinstrap, Adelie, King and Gentoo penguins in their natural habitat.  It also shows Fur and Elephant seals and has excellent scenic landscapes of ice and glaciers.

While it is not at the same level of the BBC Nature documentaries, it is very good.

Just a note:  The Blu-ray does not play the narration in the default setting.  You need to go into the audio setup menu and choose the option to ""play with narration.""

If you like nature documentaries, especially penguins, you should add ""Antarctica Dreaming"" to your collection.",1386115200,,657,4.972477064220183
8145075,5,B000ICM6L6,"If you travel 10,000 miles to Antarctica you may come back with many stories, but it's unlikely that you will have seen as much as David Hannan's group has succeeded in bringing to this spellbinding  movie. If you have an unqualified love for wild animals you may be tested a bit. I was. No escape - these birds and mammals seem uncannily like our fellow humans. With no large terrestrial predators to worry about, these animals let it all hang out for the camera. The high definition of the Blu-ray technology works against any fuzzing or skimming over that we may unconsciously employ to imagine these beings fundamentally different from ourselves.

I found Jacob Round's score appropriate, understated and whimsically charming at the same time. The narration is intelligent. If you find it distracting, as one reviewer above, I suggest you follow it once through. It will sharpen your eyes and your mind toward what you're seeing. Then simply go back and watch at another time without the narration.",1356998400,,1002,4.923076923076923
8145076,5,B000ICM6L6,"You can watch this with either a documentary, or with a combination of classical music and ambient sounds.  The artistic quality of the video, and the selection of clips, is outstanding in all ways, and compares with the better parts of the BBC Galapagos series.  I like this with ambient sounds, as it makes you watch carefully to see what is going on.  Great shots of behavior.  If you are interested in Antarctica, this is a must.  If you are not, but you enjoy Natural History, you will be interested in Antarctica after you see this.  Kudos to the photographers for a great production!  This is what BLU-RAY is about.",1298678400,2,622,4.6
8145077,5,B000ICM6L6,This video was well done.  Beautiful shots of the South Pole and its wildlife,1273363200,,77,4.5
8145078,5,B000ICM6L6,"I'm not quite sure how many Antarctica documentaries the previous reviewer has seen, but I have seen quite a few, and this one is definitely worth the time and money. The scenery is nicely shot, with a good mix of animal and nature scenes, and the Blu-Ray quality is very good, as one might expect from the HD Window series. I also found the extras, six ""mini"" documentaries, to be very interesting and a good adddition to the disc. These Blu-Ray discs are meant to be informative and high quality alternatives to the big budget ""documentaries"" flooding the market recently. It succeeds in both areas, and I think you will enjoy it for what it is, a well shot, high quality presentation.",1253059200,4,687,4.639344262295082
8145079,2,B000ICM6L6,"Although the picture quality is excellent, this film moves very slowly and the commentary is very slow and plotting. Reminds me of some professors  I had in college. This  makes for grate visual or backgroung to show off  your HD capabilitues. Unlike Planet Earth ( The best of both visual & educational) this DVD is just visual. Yes I will keep it, but wished I had purchased something else.",1202515200,2,392,4.6521739130434785
