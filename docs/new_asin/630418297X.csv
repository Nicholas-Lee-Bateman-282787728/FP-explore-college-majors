7864719,5,630418297X,was in very good condition. and was very pleased that it was exactly what it was suppose to have been as far as the shape it was in.,1392076800,,132,3.75
7864720,4,630418297X,"Once again, Akira Toriyama's ""Dragon Ball"" sparkles with these two other episodes.  The storyline is great, and Goku's naive actions are unpredictable.  This video is great, creating plenty of humour that could  make just anybody crack up.",963446400,2,239,5.405405405405405
7864721,4,630418297X,"Its cool watching Goku first meet Master Roshi.  Goku finds Master Roshi's turtle, so, Master Roshi rewards Goku with the Flying Nimbus.  But, you can only ride the flying nimbus if you have a pure honest heart.  Master Roshi  falls through ( he he, I wonder why) and Goku jumps right on and rides it  like he has had it forever.  Bulma wants something too, so, Master Roshi  gives her his dragon ball around his neck.  I think this is a god video to  watch and is good for all ages.  I give it 4 out of 5 because its cool.",962236800,3,523,4.089108910891089
