4882407,5,B003B2QJBS,Great movie. Great direction and acting from everyone.,1446940800,,54,5.875
4882408,4,B003B2QJBS,Very good. If only businesses truly followed Rocket Singh's principles ;),1430784000,,73,5.7272727272727275
4882409,4,B003B2QJBS,"This is a very charming movie with themes of employment-challenges, teamwork, friendship, and tenacity.  The story may be a bit slow for a high school class but otherwise would be a fine choice for a honors h.s. or college class studying social geography, contemporary culture in India, and more.  It's a lovely choice for an evening at home, too.  No dancing and colorful musical interludes, just a really good movie.",1406332800,,418,4.942857142857143
4882410,3,B003B2QJBS,"An average Hindi film, that had some laughs, and overall was entertaining.  However, nothing deep, nor did it challenge any mores.",1393891200,,130,5.190476190476191
4882411,5,B003B2QJBS,"This is going to be hard to capture with words, it is such a delightful film. Fresh out of college and ready to strike out on hs own in the real world, Harpeet Singh Beddi, an aspiring salesman with a heart of gold and a fantastic work ethic, gets hired by a computer company with terrible ethics and customer service. After being ridiculed by his boss and co-workers when he tried to report a client for bribing him, Harpeet has had enough and sets out to show everyone that good guys really do finish on top.",1370131200,,510,4.322916666666667
4882412,5,B003B2QJBS,"Rocket Singh is a little different than most Bollywood films that I've seen.  There is virtually no singing and dancing.  The comedy is good, but there's also quite a bit of drama.  Singh is just out of college and enters the workforce as a tech salesman.  He quickly learns that honesty is not the policy in sales and struggles to find a way of remaining honest while making money in his job.  Ultimately, Singh finds a way to do both.  Ranbir Kapoor was very good in the role of 'Rocket' Singh, though I don't recall seeing him in other films before.
A very enjoyable film about the realities of forging a career in today's world of incredible competition.",1338681600,,658,4.533898305084746
4882413,4,B003B2QJBS,"As Rocket, Ranbir Kapoor gives a good performance showing a bit more maturity than Wake Up, Sid.  Overall, I liked the premise and the development of the story.  However, this is not a normal, Bollywood story - the main character is as honest as the day is long.  In this respect, this movie was very refreshing.  I liked the way the characters were developed as well as the pace of the movie.  I would definitely recommend seeing this one!",1275523200,,440,4.518987341772152
4882414,4,B003B2QJBS,"This is a delightful comedy with a feel-good moral. Can a naive but determined young salesman succeed in a dog-eat-dog world where clients expect bribes to get their business? His idealism is initially smashed after joining a computer company that does business the usual way, with lots of graft. But he comes up with an idea to subvert the company from within by creating an upstanding company within the corrupt company. Lots of fun, best Indian film since Slumdog.",1270684800,,467,4.924050632911392
4882415,3,B003B2QJBS,"Rocket Singh is a simple story and has been told well in parts. This is a story of a struggling salesman who takes up the job because his grades are not good enough to pursue a MBA. The direction is good but falters in the last hour. Harpreet Singh Bedi is Ranbir Kapoor who lives with is grandfather Prem Chopra and plays the struggling guy at work. The movie gives sort of gives you an insight in the life of the salesman and the things that they have to do to get the job done.
Shimit Amin is the director and his narrative does not touch the heights of Chake De or that matter Ab Tak Chappan.
The scenes with the boss both the conversation on the phone and the meeting at the end are the highlights of this movie.
The relationship between the other salesmen is underdeveloped.
Dialogue writing is funny and some clever one liners make you smile.
The minuses
Direction could have been a bit tighter as well as the editing
The last hour could have changed the course, like it did in Chak De and made this movie a must watch
But watch it for Ranbir Kapoor , Manish Chaudhari who plays his boss. Their acting is simply superb. Ranbir Kapor is getting better with each movie. I gave it three stars 1/24/10",1264377600,,1204,4.308370044052864

8484867,4,B003B2QJBS,One of the underrated bollywood movie...Inspiring and Entertaining... Ranbir's performance so genuine that no one can say this his 2nd or 3rd movie...Nice movie !!,1523577600,,163,5.56
8484868,5,B003B2QJBS,Excellent movie!,1519430400,,16,7.5
8484869,5,B003B2QJBS,"Like ""Office Space"", but purer, more noble, less decadent...  Some foul language, but otherwise clean.  Some very funny bits, but this film is about hard work, integrity, owning one's mistakes as an entrepreneur.",1516060800,,212,5.393939393939394

8484874,5,B003B2QJBS,"This is one of my favorite movies.  An engaging story about a decent, average guy in the ruthless world of sales.  Told with humor and just the right amount of suspense.",1493337600,,169,4.419354838709677
8484875,5,B003B2QJBS,"I can't remember where I first discovered this film, but I watched it again now (a few years later) because I'd remembered feeling inspired by it. It reminds me of my early days with my web design company in 1997 (albeit without the corruption that he has to face). It's the classic underdog story, and now that I'm watching it again, I'm getting a taste of Jerry Maguire (without the disgusting Tom Cruise). I personally find it entertaining and inspiring at the same time. And while I'm not opposed to subtitles, it makes me realize how ADD I am that I usually multi-task through movies. You can't do that with this one. You have to fully engage ... which is a good thing.",1484265600,2,674,4.487804878048781
