This movie was cracked. It's apparently a sequel to an old Chucky rip off from 1993. And like the newer Chucky movies (except the newest 'gritty' Chucky) has chosen to go full campy goodness with this one. It looks like a freaking sesame street pal most of the time and is a little kid in a costume the rest. The movie has a solid beginning and ending but seems to lack in the middle as the puppet goes god knows where and is pretty nonexistent for that time.

In the interim we follow the grown up version of the kid from the first film as he causes mischief around a carnival. I was impressed that for a Bollywood film there were only 2 big song and dance numbers which is saying something compared to most Bollywood movies out there. There is a lot of three stooges-esque humor as he out smarts the head carnival guy who hates him for some reason or other.

 I enjoyed the film overall and it was a good one to watch with friends.",1395619200,,1009,4.239583333333333
