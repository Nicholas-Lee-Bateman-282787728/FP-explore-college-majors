information >>>>> truly there is no new exercises at all, he just says do 100 pushups without complete rest, do squats without rest, there is no true program, just random exercises that everybody is familiar with .......

most important for me >>>> his body is truly not  a good shape, he doesn't look like athlete, his musculature looks like that of a beginner, true he is strong but not enough to be my coach,  the point here is if someone wasn't able to build his own body, how he could instruct others to build theirs,  someone will tell me this is no bodybuilding DVD, this is conditioning, fine, look at true boxers in championships and see there bodies, that is called warrior conditioning ....",1387065600,,808,4.661971830985915
8010184,4,B0001CKI1I,"In this workout DVD, Mark Hatmaker presents two different exercise programs, a stretching program, and some extra material, as well.

The main workout consists of eight different callisthenics exercises. Some of them are pretty standard variety, but some moves are more exotic (like hindu squats). You need a chinning bar and a pair of handgrips to perform the main workout. The alternative workout is used only for breaking the routine, and it makes you perform 12 different exercises normally performed with barbells and dumbbells, but this time you use a sandbag. In the film, Hatmaker gives instructions on how to manufacture a sandbag on your own. The stretching workout uses twelve pretty standard stretches, but they are arranged in a special order to create a synergistic effect. The extras found on the DVD include some bonus exercises.

This is not a standard callisthenics workout video, where you can watch the film at the same time you are performing the exercises. Rather, there are only instruction on how to properly perform each exercise in the film, and you cannot use the film while working out (in the bonus material, there is one maintenance-level workout you can use like this). I think that especially the stretching workout would have been better, if you could watch the film along your own stretching workout.

My main gripe about the DVD is that to fully benefit from it, you need to buy the Gladiator conditioning workbook, also. You can probably find all the necessary information from the DVD alone, but it is designed to be used with the workbook.

The production of the film is very good, with different camera angles to enable you to see the performance of each exercise from various angles. The film gives you a very good workout, that is directly applicable to wrestlers and submission fighters, but others can benefit from it also.",1092787200,11,1866,4.952076677316294
