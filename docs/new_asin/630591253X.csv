7897790,3,630591253X,"Were it not for Justin Berfield starring, I probably would have passed on this one.  He is one of my favorite young actors though, so I gave it a view.  The story was good and there was plenty of action; but the rest of  the actors were only so-so.  (Especially the girl who played the lifeguard;  she seemed bored.)  If you're a fan of Justin's work---check out the TV  show ""Unhappily Ever After"".  Justin is way funnier than his  older brother on the show.",950054400,2,459,4.369047619047619
