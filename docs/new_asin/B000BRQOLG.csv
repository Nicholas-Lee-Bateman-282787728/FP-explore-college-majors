2439350,5,B000BRQOLG,"A great look at Celine's French-language music videos.  A far better collection then the ""All The Way... a decade of song and video"" simply because these are more interesting videos, though a great addition to anyone's collection.",1251072000,,230,5.216216216216216
2439351,5,B000BRQOLG,"You must have this dvd not only for the videos but for the extras, the making of the videos, and the making of two cds when she works with Jean. Jacques Goldman.
She is the best!",1218067200,,178,3.9722222222222223
2439352,5,B000BRQOLG,"One of the best of Celine,a collection to treasure. From her young powerful voice,then transforms into the present.it's so amazing. I listen to it all the time.i highly recommend this specially to Celine's fans.",1199664000,,211,5.235294117647059
2439353,5,B000BRQOLG,"Even though I don't speak or understand a word of French, I had to have this video for my library. I must admit that at first it was difficult to follow her in another language. and the material i beleive was mostly from her earlier years before she spoke or sang in english. It was actually interesting to see her in her natural state before she grew into the superstar and Goddess that she has become. My favorite song of hers is ""If thats what it takes"" and was her biggest hit in french. Its on this dvd in French of course, called POUR QUE TU M'AIMES ENCORE. Excellent song to get to know the lyrics of. Anyways, a must have for any Celine fan,",1168905600,5,649,4.2
2439354,5,B000BRQOLG,"I couldn't be without ""On Ne Change Pas"" DVD. It is Celine, like always, at her best in vocals,creativity,& character.

It is a revelation to the depth of meaning with which Celine Dion sings her music, all done in this masterpiece in Audio & screne technology that absorbs the senses to new levels. It is sensual, Modest & fills the mondane with life. Anyone any age would love this DVD. it is timeless,it is fun, & the live performances & the behind the scenes footage are a treat.

Merci Celine ToujoursXxX..",1168387200,3,511,4.604395604395604

2439356,5,B000BRQOLG,"I was absolutely surprised to see that we'd get a release of Celine's French videos!

It is absolutely amazing!  The only dissapointments is that it doesn't include the Album launches or the DELIVRE-MOI video.

Also some of the sound effects were taken out of POUR QUE TU M'AIMES ENCORE  and LOLITA (TROP JEUNE POUR AIMER).

Celine, thanks for this!  Keep up the good work!",1137542400,6,373,4.75

8091606,5,B000BRQOLG,Celine's French music videos from the late 1980's to around 2005. I don't speak French but Celine's voice transcends all language's. All of the videos are interesting. If your just starting to get into Celine's French work this DVD is a good place to start along with the companion 2 disc CD set released around the same time.,1384992000,,326,4.637931034482759
