3418950,4,B0018RWMNM,"This heavily edited version was a sorry disappointment. Whole sections of the original are chopped out. There is no Wilbarger, Deputy Roscoe losing his virginity is cut. Spoon's horse thieving companions cussing Deets as he settles the nooses around their necks. Scene after scene is missing. I wrote about this show, when it came out and had the original VCRs to work with. I bought this DVD as I don't have any way to play my tapes. What a let down. Most the blood and violence are there. Lots of the charm and wit is gone. However, since it is Lonesome Dove,  a Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece of a novel and a brilliantly acted and produced TV event, this DVD is probably better than anything else you could watch on any given evening in any given year.",1520553600,,760,4.547445255474453
3418951,5,B0018RWMNM,"Will probably be one of the all time classic westerns with a competitive story line. The combination (chemistry) of all the talent assembled for the cast makes very enjoyable to watch plot unfold. Seems a little slow at very start but that doesn't last very long. If you liked ""Open Range""  then this
tile will very much to your taste. Of course R.D. and T.L.J. carried the bulk of the load but others in acting crew were very complementary in their supporting roles.  It may not have had the same intensity of something like ""TombStone"" with Kurt Russell but never the less it can hold its own for sticking it out to the end. Just enjoy (they did keep bad/offensive language to a bare minimum which I felt overall kept the 5**** rating in tack).",1520467200,,746,4.518518518518518

Regarding the production, I love the performances of all of the characters. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are so authentic that you forget that you're watching something that was produced for television. This certainly is one of those things that don't need to be revisited.

3419050,5,B0018RWMNM,"""A grape changes color (ripens) when it sees another grape.""

This is not an entirely perfect movie....But it becomes one by the end.

At 6+ hours running time there is some horrendous acting (Particularly from Chris Cooper, Ricky Schroeder, Diane Lane, Anjelica Huston, even Robert Duvall in a couple instances), and also some less than great directing and writing. This can make the first half hard to get through at times, but there are also moments of brilliance in that first half that give you promise the rest will make up for it, and it does. Towards the end of the 2nd episode the series takes a very serious turn to become a gritty, epic Western that is still unrivaled in its production quality, acting, drama, and authenticity. The second half has some of the finest scenes ever filmed, period. Some of the river sequences I have no idea how they shot, they're not like anything you will see in movies today except with CGI. I bought 2 copies of this DVD set. One to watch every couple years or so, and one to keep pristine in case the first gets damaged- I think it's that great a film.",1509667200,,1099,4.517587939698492

3419084,3,B0018RWMNM,"I have said before I don't give out 5 star ratings.  Nothing is perfect.  While I don't think this is the greatest western ever made.  I do think that Robert Duvall as Gus might be among the greatest roles ever.  If this had been a theatrical movie he would have easily won an Oscar.  Although at six hours long I don't see how this would have ever made it to the theaters.  It's good to have it on dvd where you can watch as much of it at once as you want and be able to take breaks whenever you want.
Tommy Lee Jones, Danny Glover and Diane Lane are just as good.  As is the whole cast  And there are some 5 star scenes in this.  My favorite part is when they are tracking Jake and the outlaw gang that he fell in with.  But I also would have to take away a star for the last part of the movie.  I thought it should have ended when Gus died.
They had made it to Montana and started their ranch. Did he really need to drag his body all the way back across America to bury him in Texaa.  I know the point was that Call was a man of honor and gave him his word that he would.  But he lso said he would tell Newt that e was his Father.  But he didn't.  He gave him a horse  Still all in all this is great movie making.",1503619200,,1216,3.804

3419106,5,B0018RWMNM,"""Lonesome Dove"" is a four-part television miniseries from 1989 thats based upon Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of life in the Old West of nineteenth century America. Starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Diane Lane, Robert Urich, Danny Glover, and Ricky Schroder, its a tale of two aging ex-Texas Rangers and their friends who live in the small town of Lonesome Dove, Texas, located just across the Rio Grande from Mexico. Augustus Gus McCrae (Duvall) and Woodrow Call (Jones) jointly run a hardscrabble business called the ""Hat Creek Cattle Company and Livery Emporium."" (actually, its Woodrow who mostly runs the business and Gus who mostly runs his mouth.) Despite their different personalities, Gus and Woodrow have remained close friends for years.

A small crew of long-time friends lives and works with Woodrow and Gus. For Pea Eye Parker (Timothy Scott), Josh Deets (Glover), Dish Boggett (D.B. Sweeney), and young Newt Dobbs (Schroder), life revolves around Lonesome Dove, the Dry Bean Saloon, and Lorena Wood (Lane), the town's only ""sporting woman."" It seems like they are all destined to live, work out their lives, and then die, in the same spot...

Then one day an old friend, Jake Spoon, unexpectedly drops in on the Hat Creek outfit. Spoon, a smooth-talking former Texas Ranger (and former partner of Gus and Woodrows) brings with him a ""get-rich-quick"" scheme: drive a herd of cattle north to Montana, then set up a ranch there. Surprisingly, it is the stolid Woodrow, and not the impetuous Gus, who's all in favor of picking up stakes and setting out for Montana

Meanwhile, over in Fort Smith, Arkansas, July Johnson, the towns young sheriff, sets out to track down and capture Jake Spoon, fugitive from justice. Spoon had accidentally shot and killed the towns only dentist during a bar fight. Not long after July and his stepson Joe depart for Texas, July's wife, Elmira, takes off on a separate quest to find her long, lost lover. What does July do when he learns of Elmiras disappearance? What happens when he crosses paths with Gus out on the prairie? And is the Hat Creek successful in making their 2,500-mile journey from Texas to Montana?

There are simply not enough superlatives to do complete justice to ""Lonesome Dove."" Australian director Simon Wincer and co-writers Bill Wittliff and Larry McMurtry did a masterful job of adapting McMurtrys wonderful 900-page novel to the small screen in four 90-minute installments. Almost all the key events of the book appear in the miniseries, with very few changes. The acting from every member of this extraordinary cast is, of course, terrific. No wonder Lonesome Dove garnered 18 Emmy Award nominations and 7 wins, and a couple of Golden Globes as well.

I have owned Lonesome Dove in three formats  VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray. I have watched it perhaps forty times over the past 30 years, and I never get tired of it. This is entertainment at its very best. Most highly recommended.",1500336000,,2975,4.9758551307847085

3419154,4,B0018RWMNM,"There are 2 different versions of this movie/series on blu-ray. The one with the dark brown cover is the 2008 version and the one with the tan cover is the 2015 release. I have both and spent a couple days comparing the two and these are my reactions. Someone else has a review on here comparing the two, but I'll go into more detail on the differences between the video and audio quality of the two.

2008: Video - The 2008 release is slightly smoother than the 2015 release, with a small dip in fine detail. However, the colors are noticeably more vibrant and there is a wider range of colors. The black levels are a good deal blacker as well.
  Audio - The audio is much louder and more distinctive on the 2008 release. The sound effects are loud and clean, but the dialogue is sometimes barely audible. Once in a while the sound effects will be much louder than the people talking, but this only happens a handful of times.

2015: Video - The 2015 version is sharper than the 2008 release. Fine detail is more noticeable for sure. It is also a hair brighter than the 2008 release. However, the brightness does lead to the picture looking a bit washed-out. Blacks are more gray and the colors are slightly more muted.
  Audio - The audio is less distinctive than the 2008 release, but solid. The sound effects are much quieter, but the dialogue is a whole lot crisper and cleaner.

Overall, the 2008 release's video is slightly smoother, but it is barely noticeable. The colors and contrast are more vibrant and realistic. The 2015 release's video is more detailed, but less realistic in color and contrast. The audio probably depends on your set up. If you have a 5.1 surround sound system, the 2008 version will make good use of sound effects. If you don't have a big surround sound system, the 2015 release would probably be better, because it doesn't have any of the dialogue issues of the 2008 release. If you're on the fence about the two versions, and can only get one, I would recommend the 2008 version because it has a few extra special features.

The pictures show the 2008 version on the left, 2015 on the right.",1489708800,,2127,4.5064935064935066

3419168,5,B0018RWMNM,"Did anyone notice in this outstanding epic (book or TV series) that there were no obscenities used, such as f-bombs, etc., yet their absence still verifed the action, tragedy, violence, humor, love, and hate--the real deal. Of course, there were none in the TV series for obvious reasons: censorship. Yet, I don't believe there would be, decades later with TV's more relaxed films. I have read many McMurtry books and have yet to note one, and honestly I didn't even look for one. This, then, tells me that they are simply not in his Funk & Wagnalls. Most modern novels, beginning with James Jones' books, are rife with them (and they are still great fiction). Nowadays they are so common we have to dodge them like cowpatties. And the first ""OMG"" moment in filmgoers' life was Rhett telling Scarlett he didn't give a damn--Saints preserve us! The beauty of Lonesome Dove is  there are damns and hells but the obscenities are not only absent but they are not even missed, not even when Blue Duck's men violate Lorena or when Dan jaws around with his gang. It is his actions that count. A great wordsmith doesn't need to lace good or bad acts or predicaments with common fouled redundancies, and to me that is the beauty of the book and the series. It is realistic but the characters' actions speak to us with words as natural as life. His script doesn't consciously avoid obscenity because the evil Blue Duck and Dan Suggs and the other bad men and women are the embodiment of obscenity, such that we can even get a whiff. There is no distillation of Lonesome Dove in both its forms: film and book.

Look, I'm no prude and certainly not religious. What repels some of us is the use of foul words to either show off, repel or cover up stupidity. For what its worth, things that I hold sacred are a wild free-ranging animal in a natural habitat, a work of fine art in any form including a piece of music well-played and/or sung, a book or poem well written, an excellent film, sharing a great meal and a fine wine with others,""the little things in life,"" as Gus said to Lorie. In this instance, a fictional character made real with sharp distinction by Robert Duvall, for one, in a setting one yearns for, despite the thirst and hardships.",1487980800,,2237,4.548387096774194

3419288,5,B0018RWMNM,"This is the BESTEST, yes I said BESTEST, movies/mini series I have seen EVER! I watched it on Neflix so many times, I think it was somewhere like ten times, they decided to take it away :-(!!! I was in a local Cracker Barrel and found the Entire Lonsome Dove Saga on DVD and bought them of course, but none of the others compare to the original. I recently bought it on Amazon Prime and downloaded it to my iPad so when I'm traveling I can watch it whenever I want. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are the BEST paired duo since Robert Redford and Paul Newman! I think some of the reasons I love it so is because it's not just a cowboy movie it's about unwavering friendship, loyalty, love, determination and just plain ole GRIT!!! If this comment has not convinced you to watch this movie then.... Oh did I mention that I have the book on audio from Audible also and have listen to it no less that eight times from my iPad and my Android. As you can see I LOVE THIS BOOK/MOVIE!!!!  Why are you still reading this comment, go purchase this movie and watch it.

3419389,5,B0018RWMNM,"Simply put, best western ever made. Nothing compares to it. Parts 2 and 3 are the best but that isn't to say 1 and 4 are bad. They are equally important and equally substantial to the plot. My favorite western/movie/movie series in general right here, amazed I could get the whole series for $12 in HD on amazon, extremely satisfied in a deal like that. As for the movie itself, highly, highly recommend to any interested in westerns or studying film. Debatably the best series ever on the hardships of cattle drives in the early 1900's(""North ain't a place, Newt, it's a direction"") and people/women on the way there(""Whores got hearts too Woodrow, and Clara's was the purest I ever knew."").",1468022400,,692,4.7272727272727275
3419390,5,B0018RWMNM,"Remember all those Blockbuster video stores back in the old days?  I have to take some of the blame for them disappearing because surely the late fees I paid on ""Lonesome Dove"" seriously boosted their profits for at least three months.  I simply could not bring it back and I know other people who still watch it on a regular basis even though it's almost 30 years old.

If one is not too ""format specific"" and doesn't mind calling a 6 hour mini series a 'movie"" Lonesome Dove is easily the best Western ever made and before the great HBO and AMC series' (The Wire, Deadwood, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad etc.) was the highest point television ever reached.  Other reviewers who have written on the high points of television over the years before streaming video existed pretty much agree.

First of all, the chemistry between Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones (in by far their greatest performances ever) has to be seen to be believed.  If friendship contains an element of love, then this is also one of the greatest love stories of all time, even though there is never the slightest hint of any kind of ""romantic"" attraction between the two (as in Brokeback Mountain for example).  Just as often as not they seem irritated by one another, but I have seen many love affairs between men and women in which that is how they show their love for one another.  In any case it is a miracle of the craft of acting.

There must have been some magic going on while this was being filmed because the same sort of chemistry among the supporting cast runs throughout the movie as well.  Frederick Forrest plays one of the most menacing villains of all time, Diane Lane is absolutely beautiful, tough and vulnerable as the town prostitute (although one wonders how such a lovely woman would wind up in such a situation), Danny Glover delivers his best performance of all time as the humble, kind-to-a fault ""Deets"" etc.  The acting accolades are too numerous to totally recount.  Only Robert Urich seems to be slightly miscast as Jake Spoon if you are looking for a portrayal of the character that is more in line with Larry McMurty's great book.  Who cares?  Not me.

Speaking of which: the movie is fairly faithful to the book, but takes certain parts of the story and sequences them differently.  For once this works out for the better especially when you reach the film's magnificent ending.  It really could not possibly have been done better and is guaranteed to bring a lump to your throat and make your hair stand on end, whereas the ending of the book is somewhat anti climactic.  As a matter of fact, as great of an author as Larry McMurtry is it is generally conceded among fans of ""The Western"" that the mini series is far better than the book, which is far more about things winding down (entropy) and becomes very flat in many parts.

Now that such a long time has passed since its original broadcast I know there are many people out there now who love the Western genre who have never seen Lonesome Dove or perhaps have never even heard of it.  I don't want to spoil it for them by describing the plot in any more detail.  Suffice it to say that if you are into making ""5 best lists"" you are going to have to redo most of them after watching this.

It starts a little slow and takes its time unfolding but even though I consider myself to be a pretty hard core Texan who wears cowboy boots and a cowboy hat most days I couldn't make it to work after having made the mistake of watching the fourth and final episode before I went to bed the first time I saw the series.  You will know why when you watch it.

And do watch it.  It is still the greatest Western of all time and one of the most stunning ""movies"" ever made in any genre.  Watch out though; the level of tragedy and true pathos rises to about as high a level as it can get during the 3rd and 4th episodes.  If you miss work or school because they hit you too hard get in touch and I'll write a letter to your boss or teacher.  My sister, for example, can't watch it because it hits her TOO hard.

I should add that the audio and video quality of the Amazon streaming version are absolutely superb and of far, far higher quality than the VHS version of Lonesome Dove that got me addicted to this work of high, high art in the first place.

I would give it 7 stars if I could because I doubt if anybody will ever be able to recreate the magic that Lonesome Dove contains.

Absolutely magnificent!

I first bought the 2 disc set released by Mill Creek Entertainment (ASIN: B013FDBH46). I found the picture quality is a slight step up from my DVD version but fairly grainy in scenes. Other negatives are sound is only 2.0 Dolby and no subtitles. So I ordered the Genius Entertainment Blu-Ray version. Glad I did as it has a better picture than the Mill Creek Blu-Ray version and is a solid improvement from the DVD version. Has Dolby 5.1 sound, AND FINALLY offer closed captioning. This is the first version to have closed captioning of the 4 sets I have bought - 2 dvd & 2 blu-ray. The Genius Entertainment Blu-Ray discs also offer more ""bonus"" material and each episode is divided up into more chapters. Episode 1 is setup with 21 chapters vs the Mill Creek version is only setup with 5!

So I strongly suggest buying the Genius Entertainment version (ASIN: B0018RWMNM) even it cost a little more $. Hope this helps you find what would work best for you.",1464220800,,1077,4.523076923076923

Grand scale and detailed sceneries involving landscape and cattle movement.

3419686,3,B0018RWMNM,"I remember seeing this when it first came out on TNT and loved it!  I never thought a movie version would be as good as the book and I was pleasantly surprised -- it was just as good or better than the book.  But that's how I felt when I saw it for the first time.  Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are still magnificent and the cinematography is still beautiful.  But it just doesn't seem to hold up quite as well.  I don't know if it's the direction, or if for some reason the format doesn't translate well to a 16:9 format.  It almost looks like a pan and scan, but I can't say that definitively.  I need to see if I can view it in 4:3 and if that makes a difference.

I bought the DVD based on the extra features and though I haven't' gotten to them yet, I'm sure are worth it.  McMurtry is a great writer, Duvall is one of the best actors alive today and I can't wait to watch these interviews and behind the scenes and ""making of"" features.",1440547200,,940,4.037837837837838

3419729,5,B0018RWMNM,"Lonesome Dove! WOW!  I read the book years ago and when I first saw the first 10 minutes on TV, I was hooked!!!  I have a DVD collection of over 3000 titles and I would venture a guess that half are Western genre; but yet, Lonesome Dove is at the very top of my vast collection! Being a westerner, born and raised on a 6000+ acre Hereford cattle ranch in Colorado, the West IS my heritage.  Without any doubt, Lonesome Dove is the absolute pinnacle of the Western movie.  To bad my Dad did not live to enjoy this movie when it was released on TV in 1989.  I would venture a guess it would have brought tears to his eyes by experiencing the raw emotion of the story itself!  I am 6th generation cowman and even for me, it is an emotional experience when I watch it now and then and I think of my Dad sitting in his big leather easy chair and reminiscing about his youth and growing up to fill my grandfather's boots!  Frankly, they do not make westerns anymore on a level of this magnitude.  The Western IS America and always will be.  I think of ""Duke"" Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas just to name a few, but yet, Lonesome Dove is absolutely the number one of all time!!  I live in Arizona and have for years and of course Arizona is truly the last frontier of the Old West.  I live 90 miles from Duke Wayne's Bar26 Ranch located near Springerville, AZ and remembered driving by now and then when it was an active cattle spread and remember my youth on the Lazy ""N"" spread at home.  To bad that that life and time has past into history but yet I still have beautiful memories of my time.  Lonesome Dove is an emotional tribute for me and when I take time to watch it; I remember!

3419775,1,B0018RWMNM,"Yes, the Wild West was violent, but that's all there was to this piece of crap!  Never watched it when it first came out, and I'm so glad I didn't waste my time then, but 26 years later and all kinds of talk about it, thought I'd try it; plus I love Tommy Lee Jones!  I couldn't believe how much violence it had; it sickened me.  Was all this horrible stuff in the book?  I'm so glad I didn't read it; I made it to about episode 3 and just couldn't take anymore; it never lightened up or got any better.  I loved the character of Gus and liked Call even though he wasn't very nice or patient at all. I can't believe that Jake knew these 2 guys or was supposedly like them; he was a selfish bas****  in every possible way.  Too much time was spent on Blue duck and his psycho-ness; why didn't Gus just kill him outright rather than knowing what a piece of crap he was, let him just walk away when seeing him again? Was watching this with my Scottish husband who wasn't raised with all the glory of the ""taming of the west"" stuff handed to us in school.  This freaking show wasn't very damn glorified to me; am totally turned off the author and don't know whether to give him a try or not.  As far as I'm concerned besides the big heart of Gus, this was a POS that I wouldn't recommend to anyone! What a complete waste of time and film. Blah!",1427846400,,1340,4.083969465648855

3419791,5,B0018RWMNM,"Having originally owned the DVD of this masterpiece, I now have the Blu Ray and I must say I am impressed. What really impresses me about this version is it is in widescreen format. I don't know how they pulled this off because from what I can tell, there is no loss of imagery. They didn't just simply zoom in the image which would have cut off the top and bottom of what was originally a square shaped screen image. The only thing I can figure out is they shot this series in widescreen format back in 1988, at a time when TV shows were never shot this way to my knowledge. So now Lonesome Dove can be seen in the cinematic format that it deserves to be seen in. The picture quality is very good as well, a definite improvement over the DVD.",1425859200,,743,4.166666666666667

I was up late one  night and was watching a show on PBS and they did a story on Lonesome Dove. In San Marcos, TX at the S. Texas State Univ. they have an exhibit and items from Lonesome Dove. So my husband had his birthday and gifts, then informed him that the following Friday he was going on a field trip for the last gift. He was surprised. The exhibit was wonderful. They had several things for us to take home including a beautiful poster, which will be framed and hung in the guest room. Also, there were books for sale which were signed that we purchased.

3419852,5,B0018RWMNM,"I will try to make this succinct and to the point... ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!

I recently watched this again on Netflix (is that a bad word here?)... I own the DVD, and before that, owned the VHS. I have very fond memories of watching this with my father, who read all of the books (amongst his many westerns), and it's one of the few movies that brings a tear to my eye (multiple times), and probably one of (if not the only one) that has ever prompted me to write a review.

Parents, of which I am now one, watch this with your children (not until they're in their teens, or when they can comprehend and have a discussion about sex, prostitution, cowardice, peer pressure, murder, and justice). They will learn about the importance of friends, family, love, promises as more than just words, chivalry, and those topics listed above, all in the setting of characters that will live with them forever.

""By God, Woodrow... it's been one hell of a party."" (tears, honestly)

3419855,5,B0018RWMNM,"This is an excellent rendition of the Wild West, blending realism with the legends that we grew up with.
The plot has Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones(as ex-Texas Rangers) and their gathered cowhands who will move a stolen herd of Mexican cattle up from Texas to the Montana territory.  They encounter snakes, hostile Indian tribes, brigands, highway men, and just plain outlaws.  The presence of an ex-slave and a myriad of people displaced or out-of-place, and their acceptance in this 'Wild West', is one of the attractions here...
Each segment of the movie had a human touch, a feel about it.  There is no moral relativism here; everything is in stark relief, with good, bad and evil as clear as a beacon. What is unusual is that we see all aspects of the characters.
That's the secret of the film: that each character, as in life, is nuanced, a complex person, sensitive and insensitive.  Angelica Huston has a powerful role as the mother figure who punctuates the middle and end of the drive north and the final destiny of Duvall...[Ultimately, the film was about Robert Duvall's fate, Tommy Lee Jones' sense of duty, and what happens to the rest of the 'guys' and 'gals' that we care about...]
I challenge anyone to watch the first hour and then walk away from this mini-series.  It was riveting and affecting--a wonderful modern take on the Old West.  Like any Wild West film, it was rife with 'facts' that were more mythic.
Overall, it's a touching story that you will identify with.  Moreover, though much of the action is tough viewing, it's still appropriate for all audiences...",1418774400,,1592,4.7672727272727276

Robert Duvall is amazing - just the scene in Miles City should have won him an Emmy.  I remember watching the Emmys when he was nominated for Lonesome Dove and losing respect for those awards when he was past over. Just couldn't believe it!  Tommy Lee Jones, Diane Lane, Angelica Huston and Danny Glover are especially outstanding.

There is both humor and sadness in this story; Nonetheless Lonesome Dove is an epic that will surely entertain you, it will take you on a journey full of emotions. The stellar cast of Tommy Lee Jones and Duvall are just remarkable from start to end.
Enjoy it.",1416182400,,425,4.325

Now in 2014...watched it once more on the VHS...but was too poorly degraded from the years. Threw them out. Replaced them now with DVD's and the sequels to the first one. The one I found of the first movie was bought at K-Mart and is by Genius Entertainment. Same exact cover as what is shown here. Perfect crystal clear quality. Has the 2 discs and the behind the scenes features, interviews, etc. Very happy with it. paid just $5.00 plus tax. Hsve always loved this series since it came out. I highly recommend it to everyone.

The only critique I would have is that it's (at times) somewhat repetitive, even disjointed and a little contrived with a few scenes out of place or seemingly stuck in to fill the time. I didn't read the book so that may be part of the problem but I can't help thinking that a good, overall trim with a voiceover or written ""fill"" to clarify the events might make it perfect.
In any case none of that detracts from the overall authenticity, powerful drama, fine acting, impressive scenery and various historical vignettes for a superb work of Americana in the Victorian Age.",1412294400,,612,4.657407407407407

3419939,5,B0018RWMNM,"Love Duvall and the character he portrays.  Story is supposed to be based on history.  Names and places have been changed.  But it stays within the story line of The Goodnight Loving Trail, a bio about how cattle drives were started and the Cattlemen's Assoc. was started in Texas.  They drove cattle from Texas up to Dodge City, I think, in Kansas where they were loaded onto rail cars for shipment to Chicago.  After the civil war the demand for beef was great since the civil war destroyed many farms and livestock in the east.  The book goes beyond  Loving, the man who Duvall portrays, passing away.  They were not just Texas Rangers and cattlemen, they were visionaries who developed towns, brought justice by bringing in judges, started schools and churches all for the moral development of a young country.  These are the foundations that's made our country great.  The real story wasn't just shoot em up cowboys and Indians.  Parker was an Indian, one of Goodnight's best friends.  A county in TX was named after Parker.  Also, many ranchers in the early days were educated at Ivy league universities.  Totally unlike was people think of Texas today.  Another interesting thing not brought out in  this movie are droughts back in those days.  One drought took 1 million buffalo, all dead on the open prairie.  The movie is wonderful.  But the book is even better.  It helps to explain the movie.",1411689600,,1404,4.746887966804979
3419940,4,B0018RWMNM,"Its  a  pretty  good  movie.  There  are  good  parts  &  bad  parts.  2  Texas  rangers  decide  to  have  one  last  adventure  before  hanging  up  their  spurs.  &  decide  to  go  into  Mexico  &  get  some  horses  &  cattle.  From  Mexican  Bandits.  Gus  &  Lori  got  along  okay.  I  know  why  she  didn't  fall  for  Dish  &  the  other  cowboys.  I  guess  nobody  pointed  stuff  out  like  Gus.  Had  the  right  advice  for  her.
Along  their  trip  to  Montana  they  battle  Indians  one  known  as  Blue Duck.  &  some  foul  cowboys  which  Jake  Spoon  gets  mixed  up  with.
Jake  had  tried  leaving.  But  was  not  able  to  get  away  from  them.  &  they  had  other  problems  along  the  way.  First  a  boy  gets  attacked  by  snakes  water mocassins  &  from  there  on  through  the  movie  more  of  them  die.  Jake, Deet's  &  then  Gus.  From  an  Indian  attack.  His  friend  Pete  was  not  able  to  get  an  arrow  completely  out  of  his  leg.  If  only  somebody  knew  about  Clint  Eastwood's  trick  in  2  mules  for  sister  Sara,  he  said  what  to  do,  put  some  gunpowder  on  the  end  of  the  arrow  light  it  then drive  the  arrow  on  through,
he  had  an  arrow  stuck  in  his  shoulder.  That's  what  would  have  saved  Gus.
The  doctor  said  his  other  leg  needed  to  come  off.  Gus  wouldn't  let  neither  him  or  Woodrow  take  off  the  other  leg.
They  took  care  of  a  lot  of  rude  &  bad  people  here  &  there,  Gus  beats  up  a  rude  bartender  &  Woodrow  beats  up  a  mean  hunter,  who  was  whipping  Newt  because  the  army  was  trying  to  take  Dishes  horse.  The  one  whipping  Newt  was  the  kind  of  man  who  could  not  control  his  anger.  &  would  have  hurt  Newt  pretty  bad  if  Woodrow  hadn't  stopped  him.  The  people  were  a  little  shocked  as  they  were  watching  Woodrow  beat  up  that  guy,  but  I  do  not  think  they  understood  that  guy  deserved  every  bit  of  what  he  got!  nor  did  they  understand  that  guy  needed  to  be  stopped  if  Woodrow  hadn't  of.
At  the  end  Woodrow  takes  Gus  back  to  Texas.  &  fights  off  buzzards  who  picked  Gus's  body.  The  whole  movie  is  inspiring.  2  people  who  settled  right  from  wrong,  &  who  took  care  of  problems  when  no  one  else  would.  In  this  movie  their  world  is  Lawless.
Other  parts  of  the  movie,  a  man  named  July  Johnson  was  looking  for  his  wife.  He  loses  his  clumsy  like  Deputy,  &  Joe  who  was  the  son  of  Elli  who  insisted  to  July  that  it  wouldn't  hurt  Joe  to  see  the  world.  Janey  a  girl  Roscoe  had  found,  from  a  fellow  named  Sam  that  didn't  treat  her  very  good,  &  didn't  mind  his  manners,  Sloppy  &  had  a  hole  in  his  hat,  She  said  to  Roscoe  I  run  off  from  old  Sam  to  go  with  you.  She  was  Killed  by  the  vicious  outlaw  BlueDuck  as  well.  Meanwhile  Ellie  was  with  a  couple  of  so  called  buffalo  hunters  one  named  Wade &  the  other  Luke  who  almost  got  away  with  raping  her.  Then  Wade  takes  &  knocks  the  s***  out  of  him.
First  time  we  saw  Wade  on  the  whiskey  boat,  I  thought  it  was  a  little  harsh  when  he  stabbed  a  guy.  In  this  movie  law  &  order  wasn't  always  where  it  should  have  been.  Elli  then  arrives  at  Clara's  &  has  a  baby.  Then  July  shows  up,  goes  to  Ogallala  & finds  Elli,
But  they  leave  shortly  afterwards.  Bound  for  Saint Louis.  &  then  they  die  from  an  indian  attack.  Clara  then  convinces  July  to  work  for  her.  Clara  appeared  to  be  an  old  friend  of  Gus's  who  didn't  like  Woodrow  too  much.  Anyways  I  think  this  a  good  movie.  They  took  a  herd  of  cattle  &  horses  nearly  2000  miles  from  Southern  Texas  to  Montana.  Gus  &  Woodrow  did  like  to  tease  each  other.
I  love  how  they  tormented  each  other,  Gus  always  telling  Woodrow  to  loosen  up.  Woodrow  wasn't  much  of  a  gambler.  &  didn't  like  to  play  cards.  Insisted  on  sticking  to  the  work.  Gus  was  always  trying  to  get  to  change  his  mind  about  some  things.  Its  kind  of  funny.",1411344000,,4249,4.114613180515759

I'm not quite there, the mini-series has a lot of plot lines are right on top of each other and I don't see a gentle transition between them.  However, the location shots, the many actors who portray their characters are top notch and Robert Duvall is, as always, a strong presence.  Diane Lane is almost not recognizable as you see her portray other characters is her future roles, which make her a great actress, I think.  We enjoyed it, probably not going to watch it again, but will send it on to Bill!",1404604800,,560,4.46078431372549

3420044,5,B0018RWMNM,"I live exactly in ""Lonesome Dove"" country, right on the Rio Grande [Rio Bravo if you are Mexican], about 45 miles north of Laredo.  Just like Gus and Col, the border is still a war zone.  Unlike our Rangers, though, the battle has shifted.  We no longer worry about Kiowa, Comanche and Lippan.  Our problems are Coyotes, illegal aliens and drug runners.  Things haven't changed much.  It is still the Nueces Strip, the possession of which led to the War with Mexico 175 years ago.  This war led to the loss of much of the Western U.S.--including California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Colorado to the United States.  Some will argue that this ""theft"" of territory from Mexico was terribly unfair i.e. that the land, no matter Mexico's faults, was Mexico's by rights.

Then again, the Mexicans stole the same land from the Spaniards, who stole it from the Zapotecas, Maya, Tlaxcalteca, Tenochca, Cholulans, Texcocans, Otomis, Pima, Apache, Carancawa and many, many others.  Of course, these peoples stole it from other American natives back into the Ice Age.

So much for my brief history lesson.  The characters in Lonesome Dove, especially Gus, are well developed.  Then again, I've always liked Robert Duval [""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning""].  Blue Duck is overacted and John Huston's daughter as the old love interest, doesn't cut it,  but overall the film works.  Dietz [if that's the way it's spelled] is another matter.  Again we need a history lesson.  Texas Rangers of Gus's generation would have fought and oftentimes died in the Confederate Army,  Therefore, their attitudes would have been shaped by Texas' attitudes before, during and after the Civil War.  This doesn't mean that they would have been anti-black, necessarily, but it does mean that they would have been anti Yankee....necessarily.

Dietz wears a Yankee forage cap, suggesting that he fought for the Union.  Gus and Col would have shot at and probably killed men wearing Yankee blue during the war.  They wouldn't tolerate a Yankee combatant into their ranks.  It just wouldn't have happened.",1403913600,,2092,4.979768786127168

It is nothing like the Rambo series as Rambo died in the book, but not in the movie.  In chapter 97 of Lonesome Dove we read of the death of Gus.  In the movie, his death is an accurate portrayal of the book.  Plus, it's hard to beat the cast of Rober Duval and Tommy Lee Jones.",1398297600,,398,3.8518518518518516

I've probably watched it 3 or 4 times, it never gets old.  The entire cast gives an incredible performance.  Its a little longer than most movies, but you won't mind a bit.  To me, this is Duvall's finest performance, which says a lot.  The story is very moving enhanced by incredibly talented actors.

Since it was made for tv originally, it has basically 4 or so plots that hook you as you go from episode to episode. 2 Disks, 2 1 hr 40 min episodes each.  Think it runs about 6 hours total.  Cattle drive, gambling, law breaking and justice done accordingly.  Love story that will actually leave you heartbroken ladies.  My wife ADORES this movie because of the love story throughout the movie.  Laughing one minute, crying the next.  I got it for my Dad for $5.  I paid $20 for mine 5 or 6 years ago.

I loved how there are so many characters and plots to each one with a story line. It does have it's main plot and characters but it branches off from it and shows how ""it's a small world"".

It arrived right before New Year's and became our New Year's Day adventure / mini series marathon.  Believe it or not, it's a great date movie! Both me and my boyfriend loved watching this and it may become our New Year's Day tradition. By far one of the best Western movies / mini series ever made.  All of the actors are incredible and gave riveting performances.  I absolutely fell in love with Robert Duvall's character, Gus.  He was a true hero and friend, and also very human. Call was also a commendable hero, the voice of reason and passionate about what he loved. I don't think they could've found any better two actors to play Gus and Call.  The dialogue is enchanting, humorous, and specked with wisdom.  The scenery and sets are beautiful and believable. The friendship between the two men is heart-warming and reminiscent of what I have seen between Soldiers that have served together in tough times.  A true comraderie that exists like no other. I was sad when the movie ended. It was that good - I wanted to see the story continue and wished for a different outcome. Truly worth watching again and again.",1389571200,,1279,4.578947368421052

P.S. I have also read the book, Lonesome Dove, and all of the books in that series. The movie is better than the book, and the other books in the series are too gruesome to be good.

3420195,5,B0018RWMNM,"I have loved western movies my whole life, beginning when I was a young boy and saw cowboy movies like Rocky Lane, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and the Lone Ranger.  I did not see this film when it first came on television because my experience with viewing made for T.V. westerns were many times disappointing; however, I had heard from so many other western fans how good Lonesome Dove was and I purchased this 2-Disc Collector's Edition at a bargain price.  Needless to say, I was very impressed with this western story, which is the best one I have ever seen on television.

At a longtime fan of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, I think they were perfect for the roles of two former Texas Rangers who were lifetime friends.  This is the kind of western that will always be a classic.  Besides having an absolutely fantastic cast, the writers have weaved a story that is compelling and interesting.  This is a movie that has all the elements that make a movie great.  They include, writers who understand westerns, believable actors for the parts, great characters you can relate to and understand their motives, great dialogue, drama, action and even romance.  This is the kind of western that one could watch over and over again.

In conclusion, if you are a real fan of westerns this is one DVD set that should be in your personal collection.  I am glad to have mine.

He is an actor who only gets better and better as he ages.  I purchased Open Range because of him, and also watched Tender Mercies and loved every minute of it on Encore.  May he live long and prosper in whatever he chooses to do.  He is one of the few riders who Really rides  cowboy style, instead of bouncing all over the place.

3420200,5,B0018RWMNM,"Hands down my favorite Western Movie of all time.  (I'm a huge John Wayne fan as well.)
It is as if Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were born for these parts.  (All the casting is perfect - I wouldn't change one thing)

This movie almost EXACTLY follows the book - and you gain very little extra by reading the book.  Few extra tidbits by reading the book: (SPOILERS)
1) Sheriff in Arkansas wife who runs off... was a whore. She only married Jeremiah Johnson after knowing him for two weeks to get away from some guys who were using her really rough.  You see her hatred for Jeremiah and her son in the movie, but the book describes this hatred in great detail and shows what a ROTTEN human being she is.  In the movie your slightly sad that she dies.  After reading the book - you are happy she died as the earth has one fewer scumbags.
2) Newt isn't hit over the head by Blue Duck when Lorena is kidnapped.  That should be obvious that it is a deviation from the book because Blue Duck is a cold blooded killer.  He would have gutted Newt like he does everyone.  In the book - Blue Duck causes a stampede and that gets Newt caught away from watching Lorena - and that is when Blue Duck steals her.
3) The horrible men that Jake Spoon falls in with - they kill just a few more people in the book.
4) Roscoe has a few more bumbling adventures including meeting a frisky widower farm girl... kinda creepy, and the scene with the bandits on the road and Janey throwing rocks is way different in the book with a different outcome.  Sheriff Johnson does come save the day - but he arrests the men and puts them in jail.

That's the major stuff that I can think of.  Everything else is really close.  Excellent movie.  5 Stars.",1383868800,,1724,4.245398773006135

Lonesome Dove stands apart because it's so long and in-depth, has a rich and involving story line, and a large cast who are all stupendous.

It is a western inspired by the actual cattle drive of Charles Goodnight and his being the first rancher to drive 2500 head of cattle from West Texas to  rail-heads in New Mexico, then on to Montana. If you have read the book, you will be surprised if you watch the movie. This is one time a movie, based on a book, will match it in every way. When a producer asked Robert Duvall to act in the sequel, he refused and said: ""You can't improve upon perfection."" I agree.

3420231,5,B0018RWMNM,I already owned the DVD version of Lonesome Dove and I recently pulled it out to watch it. The picture quality was poor compared to blu-rays I had recently watched. I recently purchased a blu-ray player and I have been amazed at the difference in some of the movies on blu-ray VS DVD. Not all the movies are improved a lot over the DVD version but Lonesome Dove is greatly improved. I am a big time fan of this movie and after watching part 1 on DVD I went online to see if the blu-ray version was available. It was and I purchased it on Amazon and I am really happy I did. The improvement over my DVD copy was amazing. I highly recommend the the blu-ray version of Lonesome Dove which is one of the most enjoyable movies made. The difference in the detail you see in the blu-ray really makes a world of difference in this classic. I would not say this about all the DVD's VS blu-ray but in this case I do. The blu-ray version is also the full length version so you do not miss a moment!,1376265600,,987,4.145833333333333

What a great story. Then put together Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones and you have a guaranteed Classic.

Amazon said they would send me another copy, I knew the problem was with the master and I was right. Second one was the same. It's a shame that someone would market such trash. Lonesome Dove is the highest rated mini series of all time and watching it sure will ruin your opinion of this great movie.

Acting by Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones were outstanding and very convincing.  Dianne Lane was fabulous even Angelica Huston was wonderful.  The views across Texas as well as Montana were great picks to see.  My only disappointment with the Blu Ray was that in all of the dark, night scenes, it was very grainy.  You could still see the video but it was very grainy for a Blu Ray.  Apparently they must have recorded it from a low level copy.  But the rest of the video was fine.  I highly recommend it.

3420262,5,B0018RWMNM,"I saw this classic American western saga many years ago, and wanted to revisit it. Love the cinematography! Robert DuVall and Tommy Lee Jones and Dianne Lane add a dimension of real characters with real feelings that you don't see in many westerns. They embark on a long 2,500 mile cattle drive from south Texas to Montana, and this story takes you on their long journey as if you're part of the group. Along the way, they have real trials and tribulations that would have surely occurred back then. They encounter storms, horse thieves, hostile bad guys, death and life's memories and regrets. This is probably my favorite western, it has everything a great western should have, cowboys, horses, wagons, cattle, small dusty towns, the beautiful western plains, shootouts and an ending that's touching and hard to forget.

3420305,5,B0018RWMNM,"Lonesome Dove is an incredible novel by Larry McMurtry, and this mini series does a fantastic job of bringing the book to life.  It is a sweeping tale of the old west.  The case headed by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding.  This is one of my favorite movies and has been since it first aired on network television years ago.",1358899200,,339,4.349206349206349
3420306,5,B0018RWMNM,"I saw this for the first time as a teenage girl home on a sick day and was not looking forward to it.  Home sick and Mom brings me a cowboy movie?  WTF?  As I recall, the only reason I watched it was because I had a long day on the sofa in front of me and this was actually a mini-series and so promised to take up most of my day.  Well, thank goodness it was long!  It was fantastic and I got to the end of this and cried (when the reporter tells Capt. Call that people say he's a man of vision.)  And I still cry every time I see it (which is probably about once every year or two since I bought the DVD.)

These characters are so beautifully written in the book and translated to the screen that they become real people to the viewer.  You care about them, worry about them, shake your head when they do the wrong thing and laugh right along with them.  And you will laugh more than you'd think you will (even the book is funny in spots.)  Sure, there's adventure but there's also love, family, hijinks and raw humanity.

There are many adaptations of this series (and some of them have some fine performances) but this is the quintessential adaption.  Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall are magnificent and many of the supporting players are incredible too.  A truly amazing story and cast and it holds up even after all these years.

In fact, we still yell ""Joo-lie"" every time we see Chris Cooper!  Doesn't matter how many parts he plays or how famous he gets, he'll always be July to us.  Why are you still reading this?  Go watch it right now!",1358812800,,1550,4.2
3420307,5,B0018RWMNM,"Robert Duval is soooo good he earns the five stars. I like the whole story, which is both tender-hearted and very violent. Violence was endemic, but in this story the Indians are almost always the bad guys, unfortunately. This is quite faithful to the book.",1358726400,,257,4.733333333333333

3420309,5,B0018RWMNM,"But only consider buying the blu-ray.  Since watching the original broadcast of Lonesome Dove in 1988, I have purchased this superb mini-series in VHS, laser disc and dvd formats - and both the audio and video quality of all of these formats was so poor as to make the viewing experience unacceptable for me - all of which makes me very happy to be able to say that I am thrilled with the quality of the Lonesome Dove blu-ray.

There's nothing I can say about the series itself that hasn't already been said by other reviewers here, so I won't bother to review the film itself - other than to say it is simply top notch in every respect.  What has been lacking in previous releases in other formats has been the audio/video quality that this wonderful work deserved all along.  That is no longer the case.  The blu-ray transfer is awesome.  Lonesome Dove lives and can now be viewed as it should be.  It has been re-born thanks to blu-ray technology.  If you've been holding off on buying a new high def big screen set up, watching Lonesome Dove as it was meant to be seen is the best reason I can think of to do make your purchase now.  I watched it on a 70"" Sony set-up and the best word to describe the experience is ""amazing"".",1358380800,,1230,4.336244541484716

I would rerind to rewatch thinking I missed the parts I was looking for but those scenes were not there!  I first saw this on tv as a mini-series, and  there were more scenes!!  The story itself is fantastic but I will be investigating and exploring to look for a copy with no editing.

3420328,5,B0018RWMNM,"This is by far the best mini-series (and best Western) that I hveseen. I read alot and hen see a movie version. and the movie is never as good as the book. Until now !! I loved the book by Larry McMurtry, and this is as close to the book as any I have ever seen. Each character from the book is just as I imagined. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones play ""Gus McRae""and ""Woodrow Call"", respectively. They play the roles of ex-Texas rangers turned ranchers exactly as I had imagined when I read the book. That is so rare. And the rest of the characters were also extremely well cast and the actors did a wonderful job of bringing them to life. If you liked the book, you will LOVE the movie (or mini-series....just a long movie broadcast in 3 parts.) And even if you have not read the book, you will still love it. Highly Recommended !!!",1356480000,,835,4.225

There's some great footage in the Special Features of ""Lonesome Dove"" that makes one aware of how close they come to reality in this movie. Also, I wondered about the scene where Robert Duvall's horse bucks before he races away from the advancing line of riders. It surely looked like him and not a stunt double... and it WAS him. Genuine buck too! This particular package (movie and specials) is worth adding to the home library.",1351728000,,559,4.833333333333333

The work and experience involved in moving and filming the animals in this film are a remarkable achievement in themselves.  Even a 'non-western' person will like it.  I think everyone should own a copy to remind them of what it was like for those who settled our country, did so much hard work and sacrificed so much.  This performance is tough and tender, sweet and sour, beautiful and ugly, terrible and wonderful.  The special features are all right; mostly behind the scenes extras and actor commentary.

3420385,5,B0018RWMNM,"I'm a big movie fan and have seen just about every notable Western out there.  I have some favorites - some 50's & 60's classics like The Searchers, High Noon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.  I loved True Grit (both versions) and Unforgiven (and most Westerns Eastwood has directed or been in), Once Upon a Time in the West, Dances With Wolves, Silverado, Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch, the Magnificent Seven.  Even cheese like Tombstone and Sam Raimi's The Quick & The Dead.

But, really, while a lot of those films are great and some are true classics, nothing compares to Lonesome Dove, for me.  Maybe it's a bit unfair because Lonesome Dove has the benefit of being 6 hours long.  It makes the most of that time and tells a truly epic story of the old west that spans many different lives and lifestyles, reminiscing about the West as it was and foreshadowing some of what it will become.

It's got so much going for it - not the least of which is the superb writing - the deep, interesting characters and the genuinely engaging plot that weaves in subplots as compelling as the main story.  The dialogue is minimalistic, but perfect.  The whole feeling is one of stark but moving realism.

The acting is impeccable (with only a couple exceedingly minor characters feeling like the kind of acting you find in most other westerns) with the standouts being an unrecognizable Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow Call.  Both have the best roles of their careers in this movie, I think.  And Duvall has said that this was his favorite role he's ever played (and it shows).  A young Diane Lane does a fantastic job as well.

The whole production is first-rate, especially when you remember it's a TV miniseries from the late 1980's.  Even the music is wonderful - by the great Basil Poledouris.

The epic scope, gritty realism, fantastic acting and compelling story make it an unbeatable movie in my mind.  It's simply the best western ever made that I've had the pleasure of seeing.",1320451200,,2026,4.614525139664805

It was a few days before Christmas. I was looking for a really great movie I could watch with my family. I went into our local Tower Records and asked a clerk to help me with a recommendation. This young guy with spiked hair and tattoos immediately reached for Lonesome Dove. As he handed it to me, he told about watching with his mom. He seemed to melt as he recalled the film and circumstances. His statement sold me. ""I get this out every so often -- so I can watch it again.""

Now, many years later, I have to tell you the kid was right.

3420407,5,B0018RWMNM,"I saw Lonesome Dove when it first aired on TV in about 1989 and enjoyed it as much as any TV event I'd seen.  When I saw that Lonesome Dove had recently been upgraded to widescreen and remastered, I got it.  They did a good job on the remaster, most of the images are much clearer, although some of the lower light night scenes are still 'grainy'.  The wide screen image is awesome!  I'm using an upconverting DVD player to a 720p 32 inch TV and it looks as good as most movies. Also, the sound has been remixed in 5.1 surround.

Some reviewers are reviewing an edited shorter version.  This is the original 373 minute version, the original miniseries on 2 DVDs.  Each DVD contains 2 episodes about 1 and 1/2 hours each.  There are also some bonus features included, which includes a new interview with director Simon Wincer who explains this new updated version.  He says Lonesome Dove was shot on film so the upgrade was possible.  He also talks about showing the original film version to critics and VIPS in a movie theater!

I also notice a few people are giving the movie as a whole negative reviews.  That's OK, but if you've never watched Lonesome Dove, don't let a couple of naysayers keep you away.

3420409,4,B0018RWMNM,"If you have never seen Lonesome Dove, then you have a treat that is waiting for you.  Just about everything works in this movie.  The cast is outstanding, the story / screen play will keep your interest and combined with beautiful cinematography that is just a pleasure to watch.  With 4 hours of runtime, there is pleny of time to develop the story and characters.  Even saying that, I wish it was longer.  Reminds me of a few books that I have read, that I was sad when it ended because you begin to live through the characters.

There are so many good performances within Lonesome Dove.  Naturally, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall are the heavy hitters here.  Both were stars before but believe Lonesome Dove cemented their credentials as being top actors within Westerns.  Even with these two seeming larger than life, Diane Lane is unforgettable as the vulnerable and heartbroken prostitute.

The only disappointment than I have is in the digital transfer.  The image quality is very good but falls short in the formatting.  Lonesome Dove was initially released in 1989 as a miniseries for TV, meaning that it originally shot in a 4:3 format.  This bluray version is reformatted to appear to be ""Widescreen"" 1.78:1, so the top and bottom is being chopped off in order to make it appear widescreen.  There are some shots that you just don't feel like you are seeing the entire picture...because you aren't.  Still, this is a minor criticism in looking at the production as a whole.

3420411,5,B0018RWMNM,"The Lonesome Dove mini-series is absolutely fantastic.  As a movie fan, I've always liked Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones.  They are both great in this Western.

I can write all about the characters in this Western, but would like to focus on the two protagonists.  Duvall's character, Gus, is light-hearted, enjoys life and entertainment, and is openly kind and caring.  Jones' character, Woodrow, is reserved, hard-working, and covertly caring.  Both characters are fair, equitable, smart, great leaders, justice-seekers, and fearless.  In essence, what one lacks or doesn't display, the other does.  A great friendship built on trust, experience, and complimentary attributes.

Throughout the movie you really come to know and love these characters, as well as others.  The music is great, the scenic land shots are beautiful, and the story is excellent.

3420413,5,B0018RWMNM,"The Western genre is one of the oldest movie genres in Hollywood. It started out with the silent films, the Tom Mix movies, all through the great John Wayne films, the Jimmy Stewart-Anthony Mann masterpieces, up until the time when the Western almost ceased to be a genre, because most of the moviegoing audiences had moved on to other Hollywood fare. But it was the success of such movies as ""Pale Rider"" and ""Silverado"" in the 80s that really brought the Western back to American theaters. Now perhaps that success has not exactly spilled over to today's movies, but the Western is still a revered genre and an art-form. It was those same feelings and that genuine likeability for the Western genre that caused ""Lonesome Dove"" to become such a hit. Also because of the fact that there are countless reviews from critics and fans that had never particularly liked Westerns in general, but they were the same ones that absolutely loved ""Lonesome Dove"".

The story starts off with two retired Texas Rangers, Augustus McCrae and Woodrow F. Call, who are also long-time best friends. McCrae (Robert Duvall) is a rascal through-and-through, but not without the emotion needed to appreciate the good things about life. Call (Tommy Lee Jones) is a much more buttoned-up and reserved character, serving as the perfect foil for Duvall's McCrae. Call and McCrae run The Hat Creek Cattle Company, in the basically deserted town of Lonesome Dove, Texas. However, this company does not get much business at all, allowing McCrae to have more than enough time to be lazy and loaf around, which sets the stage for some hilarious scenes with Duvall and Jones. An old friend and fellow Ranger of theirs, Jake Spoon (Robert Urich) shows up, with plenty of wonderful things to say about that faraway place known as Montana. McCrae is content to stay in Lonesome Dove, but Jake's words ignite something in Call's mind, and before long, he can think of nothing else but starting a cattle ranch in Montana. McCrae thinks Call is purely out of his mind to want to start another long adventure, especially considering that the world seemingly no longer accepts them as they are. But Call manages to convince McCrae to come along, and thus begins the epic journey.

""Lonesome Dove"" is a classic on so many levels. Like most classic films, the miniseries seems to know that it is an epic - that it is destined to become something great. This aspect is shown most significantly with the cast. All the cast members, from the ones with large speaking roles to the ones with only a few lines, seem to instantly understand the profound depth and raw emotion of the story, and therefore channel that into their own performances. Literally every scene is beautiful, purely character-driven, emotionally intense, dramatically real; even the opening credits evoke that peculiar feeling that the viewer is in for a heck of an experience. Since ""Lonesome Dove"" is an absolute character piece, every actor or actress must be well-chosen and their performance must be acted to the best of that person's ability. There are, of course, the aforementioned Duvall, Jones, and Urich, all of whom having talent that is nothing short of fantastic. But also worth mentioning are the likewise majestic performances of the remaining cast. Each character has something of importance and depth to bring to every scene in which they appear - Rick Schroder as the fatherless and confused Newt, Danny Glover as the steadfast scout Deets, Diane Lane as the gorgeous bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold, Frederic Forrest as the evil half-breed Blue Duck, Chris Cooper as the inexperienced but compassionate July Johnson - the list goes on and on. This criteria is the same for all the storylines, as well. Each of the storylines is effective, and they all tie-in together excellently, with not one of them being left out. There has been some debate over whether the secondary storyline, with July Johnson searching for his ever-fleeing wife, is really necessary. As a matter of fact, it is more than necessary - it is essential. July's story contributes to the main plot, but these story intersections are never obvious or contrived.

The story, to put it simply, very easily and firmly captures the feel of the Old West, both as it was in its prime and in its passing-on. That really is one of the main themes of the story - as time passes on, things and people become different and grow old; change is inevitable in this view of the West. All of the characters, in their own way, realize that they must change with the times and situations surrounding them, and that if they don't, they might as well just stop living, because there truly is no other way. This point is very clearly presented with the terrific ending montage. As Woodrow remembers all that has happened during their long journey - with Poledouris' gripping score played over the scenes - the heartwrenching and terrific emotion can bring anyone to tears. The miniseries does contain some unnecessary sexual implications and bad language, but aside from those elements, ""Lonesome Dove"" is one of the few productions on film that I definitely consider to be undeniably perfect in every way.",1299542400,,5195,4.901136363636364

Yes, Danny Glover does a great job portraying Joshua Deets.
Yes, Robert Duvall does a fair job portraying Augustus McCrae.
Yes, Anjelica Huston does a great job as Clara Allen.
Diane Lane may have been attractive eye candy, but I doubt very much any woman of that caliber would ever have been actually in a one horse town's saloon as a whore.  She was cast inappropriately, which is born out later in the film by the town where the two uglier whores (one obese and old) took the young cowboys trade.  Diane Lane's character Lorena Wood was a little over the top for sweet, attractive, and over-played for the sympathy factor when she is kidnapped and abused by the half-breed, the Indians, and the filthy vermin vagrant liars and thieves.  Had she been as old and ugly as the other whores, nobody would have cared even half as much.
Robert Urich in the role of Jake Spoon had nothing consequential about it.  Another lame duck role, that I was surprised Robert Urich let himself be part of.  Robert Urich should have done commercial endorsements instead.  How desperate does an actor have to be to accept the role of Jake Spoon?
Glenne Headly's role as Elmira Boot Johnson was so pitiful the viewer can't help but be grateful she ends up terminated like she was.  What a useless piece of . . . . Although, I've dated women like her, and was married to a woman like her now that I think about it. Those examples however are alive and well, and who gives a rat's . . .
My biggest disappointment however was with Tommy Lee Jones in the role of Woodrow F. Call.  His heart just obviously wasn't in it as an actor.  I've seen performances in other films by Tommy Lee Jones that literally inspired me.  In ""Lonesome Dove"" he was so stiff and seemed to stumble over half-forgotten lines that he frequently was a little too obvious he almost forgot altogether as he blurted in his half-audible mumble.  He seemed so throttled back I wondered if he felt he was getting half of what he should be getting paid, so he only gave it half of an attempt as an actor.  He can't be proud of his part in this film.  The producer or director that tried to make him look like Kenny Rogers ruined an otherwise potentially great actor's reach.  What a waste to see Tommy Lee Jones reduced into a corncob and unconvincing character that seemed like he was fighting an urge to itch himself all over - throughout the entire film.  It was like casting a cat in a dog's role.
Chris Cooper's role as July Johnson should have been much more developed and it should have gone somewhere, but never did.  Kind of like hiring on at employers who made the interview speech so incredible, but then finding out they were talking about a fantasy of their own that they'd like to believe in - but nobody else can because reality is too otherwise persuasive.
The movie would have been absolutely tedious had it not been for Robert Duvall and Anjelica Huston.
Six and a half hours of a movie that never really goes anywhere, doesn't conclude anything, and leaves all the loose ends untied.  Good grief.  I'd rather watch Kevin Costner in ""The Postman"" than ""Lonesome Dove.""
This movie is like sincerely courting a woman for 6 years and never getting more than a single kiss from her for your trouble, then one day you just stop hearing from her and she won't answer your texts, emails, or phone mail.  Anybody who raves and raves what a wonderful movie this is, also goes out in the spring and summer and sits in a patio chair to enjoy watching the grass grow - enthusiastically and fanatically, having a hard time figuring out why everybody else can't appreciate the awesome entertainment.  Gag me with a spoon.
Am I serious?  Not to put too fine a point on it, I'd rather watch 100 reruns of the exact same one night's July 2, 1955 debut broadcast of syndicated ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" than admit I watched ""Lonesome Dove"" more than a single excruciating time.  If you want a great western, you haven't found it yet.",1297296000,,4222,4.519053876478318
3420421,5,B0018RWMNM,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I think the human conflicts are timeless. I originally bought a VHS version but it had cut out aboout 18 minutes for the series. For me, Those 18 minutes were/are VERY important to some nuances in the meaning of the movie. So, I make sure when I give it as a gift that I get the whole thing. People nowadays don't have much patience, so I find I have to ""force"" them to watch episode 1, but after that, they are ""hooked"". I think this is one of the best most ""human"" movies ever made. I NEVER get tired of seeing it and it never ceases to bring up a tear or two thousand. In my opinion, this movie is a TRUE classic about the human spirit. ...getting ready to order it again for another friend.

The scene I remember most is the picnic scene with Angelica Houston & Robert Duvall sitting there talking. The detail of everything in that scene was incredible. The food looked like you could reach over & grab it & the flowers & leaves & grass were all so lifelike, as was the quilt, & the detail in their clothing was unreal.

You will be hooked and will watch it as much as , say a fan of Groundhog Day watches that movie.  The dialogue in the book is so fantastic, the words are not changed in the movie to ""make more impact"".  It doesn't matter this movie is a western, it's so well made and well-acted, it could have been any genre.  It's Duvall's best performance ever.  I recommend it for male, female, children (children have a more vivid thought processs than adults). It will make a positive impact on 99.9% of those who view it.

3420431,5,B0018RWMNM,"I savored every minute of the approximately eight hours of the miniseries.  The characters are not, as is too often the case in movies, animated cardboard cutouts, but real people.  The script is full of wisdom and humor.  Best of all it shows the early West in at least partially realistic terms.  It was a tough place, full of both good and bad people.  The portrayal of indigenous people is especially refreshing.  Instead of being time-travelers from the Green Peace movement as they are normally portrayed in modern movies, they are human beings.  Some are kind.  Some are cruel.  Some are just trying to get by.  Some are trying to defend their land and way of life the best they can.

And then there's the photography.  This film makes even Texas look beautiful!

I live in Thailand and it cost me a pretty penny to get this movie shipped here (Amazon doesn't allow online downloads to this country).  But it was worth every cent.  My own roots in the West go back to 1849 and my grandmother was the first Anglo baby to be born in my part of Wyoming, so I know from accounts of those who were there (albeit as young children) whereof I speak when I say that if you want to know what the real Old West was like, buy this movie.",1285632000,,1233,4.393805309734513

The picture clairty more than made up for the crop and I doubt if one could argue that it made a substantial difference as far as cinematic impact was concerned.  I've seen both and most certainly prefer the blu-ray widescreen to the original format.
Although the audio was ok, I thought it could have been better, if so, I would have rated this movie 5 stars.  The sound seemed shrill at times and a bit indistinct in certain areas with the background too much in front.

3420482,5,B0018RWMNM,"This is principally a review of the Blu-ray Disk. There is little to say about the film that hasn't already been said. It's a classic -- not just a great Western, but a great movie, one of those very rare films that perfectly captures the tone of the book it's derived from. (The book was originally a screenplay for Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, and John Wayne. That's another story.) But I /will/ say a few things.

Though Robert Duvall's performance has been universally lauded -- he utterly nails Gus -- not enough has been said for Tommy Lee Jones', which is arguably even better than Duvall's. Woodrow F. Call is a loyal, hard-working, but dismally dull human being, highly asocial and devoid of (and largely incapable of understanding) basic human feelings. This is fairly clear in the novel, and made all-too-clear in the two (quite unnecessary) prequels. When Maggie throws hot corn meal in his face, you're glad she did.

What's amazing about Jones' performance is his ability to bring complexity (and even some warmth) to what is essentially a ""dishwater"" character, while not losing Call's fundamental cluelessness. This is particularly notable in the scene where Po Campo explains why he doesn't ride animals: ""You are an animal. Would you like another animal riding you?"" Jones portrays Call's utter inability to see things from any point of view other than his own shallow, parochical perspective, in an amazing piece of facial acting. Ditto for the scene where he gives Newt his father's watch. * The expression on his face is indescribable, as is his inability to articulate his feelings. And then there is Gus's death scene, as great a piece of acting (from both men) as you'll ever see anywhere. It never fails to reduce me to tears. As fine an actor as TLJ is, I've yet to see a performance from him to equal this one.

Though the mini-series was shown in prime-time on CBS, I should warn parents that ""Lonesome Dove"" includes ""adult"" subject matter that is treated bluntly, and there are a few scenes of appalling violence. It is not suitable for pre-teens.

As for the BD transfer... Until now, ""Lonesome Dove"" has never looked very good. It wasn't particularly impressive in its original broadcast, and neither the LaserDisk nor the DVD did much to improve it. The image was so soft and grainy I suspected the film was shot on 16mm -- which made no sense.

Why? Because it would most-likely have been shot in widescreen on 35mm stock, in anticipation of producing a shorter theatrical version for European distribution. It turns out that ""Lonesome Dove"" /was/ shot in 35mm widescreen (1.85:1), and that's what's on this disk. The difference is a revelation, an extremely sharp image with gobs of beautiful (but not exaggerated) detail. I'd give the image quality a solid B+. (If there weren't even better BDs out there, it would get an A-.) You will not be disappointed.

The cinematography is outstanding. Not only are scenes shot at the appropriate time of day (a rarity for any film), but the lighting is perfectly balanced. For example, indoor shots look as if they're lit by indoor (or window) lighting, but the outside (as seen through windows and doors) is /not/ ""blown out"". That's not easy to do, especially in a long film with a short shooting schedule.

My only complaint about the transfer is that some of the night scenes (indoor and outdoor) are extremely grainy (probably because they were underexposed, due to an obvious attempt to use only lanterns, desk lamps, etc), and nothing appears to have been done to reduce the grain. Worse, some of the outdoor night shots show white horizontal streaks, as if the negative had been damaged. Most of this could have been fixed, but it wasn't.

A wonderful film that you can now see as it was meant to be seen. Unreservedly recommended.

* Call is so asocial, even to the point of being somewhat feral, that one wonders how he could ever have /had/ a father.",1252627200,,3937,4.786450662739322

The realism and interaction between the lives of people involved is what makes this so special. Don't pass this by because you think it's just a western. I'm not a huge western movie fan myself, so make an exception for this one. I would also recommend the book, if you like to read.

This made for tv mini-series tells the intriguing tale of Gus and Woodrow, two old Texas Rangers. The casting choice of Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones is perfect for these two characters. They both are riveting in these roles, and make you admire the pure masculine leadership they demonstrate leading the cattle drive from Texas to Montana, and the adventures they encounter along the way.

Others have already described all the sub-plots and characters involved in this epic drama. The series contains everything you need in a good Western - tough men, good humor, enormous challenges, interesting plot twists, exciting gun fights, bad guys, good guys, strange characters, love, loss, hardship....it is all there. There is something for everyone whether you are a Western fan, or not. If the final scene between Gus and Woodrow does not bring tears to your eyes then you should check in at the nearest hospital.

I recently bought the DVDs and watched the entire series again, and was just as interested as the first time I saw them. My wife and kids have greatly enjoyed Lonesome Dove as well.

3420500,5,B0018RWMNM,"This film follows McMurtry's book  so well, as the director notes in the bonus section, that there are virtually no dialogue changes. The DVD comes in a two DVD set with the four parts split evenly between the two with the bonus features as well, The bonus features include interviews with casts, director and author and show some of the films highlights including each one's favorite part. The outdoor scenes, script and acting is top notch. The supreme benefit of this epic is the time spent in character development that allows one to get to know the characters so thoroughly and appreciate the bonds between these men looking for perhaps their last great adventure with young cowboys in tow. Tommy Lee Jones as Texas Ranger Woodrow F. call, possibly his greatest role, and Robert Duval as captain Augustus McCrae  are outstanding with such a great cast with Danny Glover Robert Urich, D. B. Sweeny, the surprising Rick Schroder, Diane Lane, Anjeclica Houston  and the excellent character actor Timothy Scott who plays Pea. The DVD starts in ends with each four parts and, as the director states in the bonus section, it was literally four movies made into one. The scenes are so realistic that even the cattle were bought in Mexico to not just replicate scrawny worn looking animals but they were all those things making the trail dive more realistic.  Tremendous action packed film full of realistic scenes and when Tommy Lee Jones (or his stunt man) slams his horse into a bully's, it certainly looks and feels real. Watching all four sets was delightful but the last one was exhausting as the latter part is one of the saddest in movie history but it pays tribute to the characters played by these great actors as each loss is heartfelt. The dialogue is just tremendous and well delivered, such as when Woodrow beats a man senseless, recovers finally and notes he is being observed by townfolk, expresses simply, ""I just hate rudeness in  a man.""",1246060800,,1953,4.800595238095238

I know some of you will laugh after reading this,but I really can identify with both characters in this movie. I see myself as the serious Call,but also the jester McCrea.

3420509,1,B0018RWMNM,"I got this show based on the many high reviews, but when I actually watched it my reaction was very different.  The story is beyond gritty, it wallows in dirt.  For example,Robert Duvall's character is physically dirty, he rarely washes (this point is made clear), and has two pigs who are forever rooting in the dirt and eating trash as pets.  They chase after him repeatedly, but he never says a kind word to the animals.  Instead he curses them and achases them off, and he does so by kicking one leg up at them sidewise, eerily resembling another animal relieving itself.  We are apparently meant to take this warmly.

Duvall and Jones are run-down, crooked derelicts, with no plans in life other than to get by and evade the law.  Their idea of work is to venture across the Mexican border and steal livestock.  In the first episode we see them sneak up on their hapless Mexican victims and stampede a herd of the Mexicans' horses, driving them up to Texas and shooting at them while they commit the robbery.  They are whooping and laughing while they do it, like this is all a good time.  Are we supposed to sympathize with these outlaws?  They are not ""good guys"" in any sense.

Then there's meanness and brutality.  A young woman is trying to escape from the horrible people in Lonesome Dove, Texas, and, lacking the money for fare, jumps aboard a whisky boat in desperation.  This is a small barge manned by half a dozen of the filthiest, meanest, dumbest men you ever want to conjure in your worst nightmare.  While she cowers between the whisky barrels, they leer and grin at her, and talk about who's going to be first with her.  About then, the filthiest, most animal-like of them stabes another to death and throws him in the river, announcing that he's going to marry her.  She tells them that she's married, her voice getting fainter and...I'll spare you the rest.

I stopped watching, because it was all too depressing.  I'd like to have at least someone to root for.  The Duvall and Jones characters are not any form of heroes.  They have lapses in their criminality along the way, and maybe some people interpret this as goodness.  I did not.

The characters here are not merely bad, or outlaws, or flawed.  They're rotten, miserable people.  I'm sure there were some men like this in the early west, but I'm equally sure there were even more honest and hard working folks.  After all, the west did get built.  These miscreants, drunkards, woman beaters, murderers and rapists were not the ones who did it.

This story does not hold a candle to the many better westerns that have come before it.  Try watching The Naked Spur or Man From Laramie or The Searchers or many others and see for yourself.  Lonesome Dove is a mean-spirited anomaly.  I agree with whoever noted that it is definitely NOT for family viewing.",1242864000,,2834,4.5968063872255485

3420511,3,B0018RWMNM,"Conventional wisdom had it that the Western was dead when after years of false starts, Lonesome Dove finally made it to the screen. Starting life as a 1971 screenplay for John Wayne, James Stewart and Henry Fonda before becoming a best-selling Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, it was even briefly mooted as a possible vehicle for Redford and Newman as the two former Texas Rangers who go on one last cattle drive, but was deemed too risky for the big screen. The end result was certainly worth the long wait, earning huge ratings and a well-deserved reputation as one of the finest television Westerns ever made.

True, the first episode is a bit slow as the characters mull over the wisdom of a cattle drive at their time of life, but the time spent getting to know the large ensemble pays off: by the time they leave the dead-end town of Lonesome Dove we know enough about them to genuinely care about their fate over the long and dangerous journey, giving us a Western that's not only thrilling but often genuinely touching. It's a beautifully produced saga, with fine performances from most of the cast - particularly Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones - strikingly directed, often breathtakingly shot and boasting one of Basil Poledouris' most beautiful scores.

So why only three stars? Well, unfortunately though the original DVD release needed remastering, this new edition rather botches the job. The picture quality is better, but unforgiveably the image has been cropped from its original fullframe to widescreen, making a travesty of the original framing and often losing detail in several scenes. So, for the time being at least, the choice is between a poor older edition in the right ratio or a clearer image but less of it on this new edition.

Well any fear I may have had that ""Lonesome Dove"" would seem dated, or that it couldn't possibly be as good as remembered was put to bed after the first 10 minutes.

This fantastic adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel has stood the test of time. If anything it's gotten even better with age! Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones as Texas Ranger Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call have created career defining characters.

The basic story is that the two Rangers decide to have one last adventure in the waning days of ""the Old West"". Driving a stolen herd of cattle from Mexico up to the Montana Territory to start a new ranch in one of the last ""wild"" places remaining in the new nation. Of course, the cattle drive is simply window dressing. The real reason to watch the film is the bond and friendship between the two men. Watching these two men deal with life, love and loss on the trail through the American midwest is so engrossing and entertaining that you hate to see the story come to an end. This is a character driven story, and you really come to love these characters. ""Lonesome Dove"" is full of twists and turns, at times you will be chuckling and in the next moment you'll have a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes.

Fans of the novels will really enjoy this faithful adaptation as well. While it would be impossible to delve into as much detail as McMurtry provides in the books, ""Dove"" does not only a great job packing so much of the novel into it's six hours, it is also able to capture the feel and spirit of McMurtry's tale (If only they had taken as much care and time with the other films in the ""Lonesome Dove"" series of films)

To illustrate just how engrossing this film is, while my wife and I planned on spooling this film out over several evenings...once we started watching it, we couldn't turn it off! We have a marathon viewing of the entire series in just one sitting! Fantastic, and highly recommended.",1241395200,,2170,4.415

3420515,5,B0018RWMNM,"This six-hour television mini-series was as good as advertised, which is saying a lot. I don't prefer long movies but this is very watchable. It's such an interesting story and so-well photographed that you don't mind the long length.

The acting is top-rate, led by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, with a deep cast that includes many well-known actors. As a male, I really enjoyed ogling Diane Lane and I've always liked Glenne Headley, too, although more for her voice.

Fredric Forest is absolutely brutal as the half-breed killer, one of the most unremorseful murderers I've even seen on film. Angelica Huston, Rick Schroeder, Danny Glover, Robert Urtich, D.B. Sweeney and Steve Buscemi all were superb, too.

The story has a great mix of drama, romance, action, sadness and just plain realism. The characters are bold and unrelenting and you find yourself getting wrapped up in this story and with these people, what they went through. It's just great storytelling but - as in real life - it isn't all roses; there's a lot of sadness here.",1236902400,,1047,4.870786516853933

3420517,4,B0018RWMNM,"I bought my 1st copy of this DVD when it first came out and my copy always had a bad sector at the beginning of the 2nd part.  Since then I've gotten a 42"" plasma screen and just recently a Blu-ray player.  When I played my Standard Format discs I noticed that the picture quality wasn't great even with the automatic upscaling to 1080i and the 2nd part still had that bad sector.  So, I bought a Blu-ray copy to replace my old Standard Format discs.

The picture quality is better on this Blu-ray than it was on my Standard Format.  But it is not as good as the other Blu-ray discs I've purchased that where made in HD.  So, if you're buying this Blu-ray for a crystal clear picture, you might be disappointed.  But, I am pleased with the purchase just for having a better copy of one of my favorite movies.

I've now purchased a few old favorites and found that with the upscaling feature, I don't really need a Blu-ray copy as it doesn't make the source material any better.  So I now look more closely to see if it was made in HD or just copied from the original source.  But, this purchase was worth it to me.",1236297600,,1114,4.212264150943396

3420520,5,B0018RWMNM,"I have spent most of my life hearing about the LONESOME DOVE Mini-Series but never watched it until recently.  I can't believe what I have been missing all of these years - what a great movie!  The story at face value is about the 2,000 mile cattle drive that two ex-Rangers make from Lonesome Dove to Montana; the TRUE story is about the bond of two life long friends: Captains Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones) and Augustus McCrae (Robert Duvall), the maturing of a young boy Newt, and the hardships and life-lessons learned along the way.

  This series is the epitome of ""the western"": there is plenty of gunfighting, cattle-driving, and outlaw-chasing - but this movie really tops them all in terms of the overlying story that unfolds during it all.  Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall shine as their comraderie and friendship is displayed on screen.  You see how each handles loss and love in his own way - and how each has differing effects on the men that they lead. It also shows the maturing of a young man, Newt Dobbs (Rick Schroder), as he goes from awkward boy to steadfast cowhand through the mentoring of the two Captains and Scout Joshua Deets (Danny Glover), while also being influenced by ex-Ranger Jake Spoon (Robert Urich).

  Lonesome Dove is a movie that delivers plenty of action, adventure, humor, and tragedy - and does it with class and panache.  You get to know and love (or really hate) the characters presented.  I know, Six hours sounds like a long time, but after six hours you are actually left wanting more and hate the fact that it ended.

  I could not recommend this movie/mini-series highly enough.  Immediately after finishing it, I went out and bought the book - just to get more insight into the characters presented.  Even if you are not a huge western fan, the presentation, story-line, and characters will keep you entertained for hours.",1235088000,,1876,4.705521472392638

3420523,5,B0018RWMNM,"I'm a huge fan of Westerns, but every once in a rare while a film (or in this case a TV miniseries) comes along that you realize has changed your world view and you know that you'll be able to watch over and over again for the rest of you life.  The Lonesome Dove series is one of those films.  This is one of the best Westerns and best films ever made.  This is the kind of film that actors work towards and dream about and aspire to in hope that they can make just one film like this during their entire career, and most actors will never achieve it.  Some actors (like Kevin Costner after Dances With Wolves) will, after making one film like this, futilely dissipate their acting careers in silly movies trying to recapture whatever made that one film great.  A very, very few actors, including Robert Duvall in Lonesome Dove, are fortunate enough to find this more than once.

This film is about the Old West, it is about friendship, hard work, sacrifice, love, regret, choices, family; it is about life.  This is definitely not just another `cowboy' movie, although it does share many themes with the conventional horse opera or adventure story.  The scope of this film encompasses ageless themes about life and the human condition:  people will be watching this film hundreds of years from now and no matter how society changes, this film will still be meaningful.

Two aging Texas Rangers, Capt. C. W. Call (Tommy Lee Jones) and Augustus McCrae (Robert Duvall) decide to drive a herd of cattle from their small south Texas plot to Montana.  What follows is a complex, multi-threaded tale of life and death in the old West as the rangers and their companions (some old comrades and some new acquaintances) drive the cattle north.  Many new faces are encountered along the way, some peripheral to the plot, some taking more important roles.  We learn about the Captain's and Gus's past, their loves, their courage and bravery.  More importantly we learn about their failings and their regrets.  We see life unfolding for individuals and families, and things don't always work out well in the end.  But as in real life, one must keep going and do one's duty.  Like most of the great Westerns, Lonesome Dove is long on atmosphere, plot, and character development and relatively short on action.  There is certainly plenty of action in the film, but it is widely separated by long segments of essentially dialogue.  This isn't a feel good film either where all the bad guys are vanquished in one great battle at the end.

Bottom line is that is is a great movie/miniseries/whatever.  There are (as of 27JAN09) more recent releases of this series, I'm writing the review of this version because it is the one that I currently own.  I also think that in many ways this film is America.  If a foreigner (or a space alien) asked me which one film best portrayed the American spirit, I think I would recommend this one.  It isn't really historic or patriotic, but for me this film epitomizes what life in America and being an American is about.  Facing the challenges of life and accepting the good and the bad with a spirit of humanity and compassion that can't be broken.  Judging from the other reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks this a great film.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  If you watch this film once, you'll quite likely be watching it many times again during your life.",1233014400,,3390,4.605

Call, the stoic, is the polar opposite of McRae, a fun-loving ""philosopher.""  Their poignant farewell is one of the most touching you will ever see on film.

3420545,5,B0018RWMNM,"Back in the 1840's the State Texas was known as the Texas Republic, a harsh environment where several cultures clashed: Apache and Comanche, Anglos and Hispanics, for the most part, Mexicans. The battle over land, water and resources was furious, the spirit of these men as they set out to conquer, indomitable. The Texas Rangers were members of a law enforcement agency that investigated crimes from murder to political corruption, tracking fugitives and forging most important events in Texas history.

In their early days, the Texas Rangers protected the frontier against Indian attacks on settlers, then serving as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for those wishing to settle in the West. These men were trained to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, an amazing development from the usual technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading.

We now see Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones star as Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call. In this last installment, the cowboys are much older but still want adventure in their lives, so they set out to drive cattle to Montana, for 2,500 miles.

They steal cattle from a gang of Mexican cattle rustlers and it is quite fun to witness how it gets done. Robert Urich plays the part of Jake Spoon, a Ranger who used to help the prostitute that gave a son to Woodrow Call. But he has changed and we soon see him involved with a local prostitute, played by Diane Lane. He is not good to her and gets involved with a gang of murderers that bring him dishonor and death.

The cattle drive is fascinating, we learn much about how to survive in the west, where to cross rivers, and what to avoid. The scenery is beautiful and the performances are outstanding. Angelica Huston plays the role of Clara. Don't miss it.",1221091200,,1777,4.778501628664495

3420556,5,B0018RWMNM,"Reviews abound on the quality of the storyline, the cast and the acting, the filming, how viewers who ""don't like Westerns"" or ""can't sit still through a long movie"" regard this as a masterpiece.  They are correct-no better film's ever been made, in my opinion.

The Blu-Ray presentation of the film is very nice, with good color and excellent sound, both improved over the DVD release.  A common complaint on other Amazon reviews has been the cropping of the original film dimensions to fit a 16:9 screen--a process that does end up costing some of the original film (mostly on the bottom of the screen).  The trade-off is that all of the screen real-estate on your beautiful, expensive plasma or LCD is filled--no black bars, no stretched faces.  For me, it's a worthwhile tradeoff.  It's really not noticeable to me, and if you are engrossed in the story and the scenery, you won't notice much either.

If you're a lucky owner of a good TV and a Blu-Ray player, this all-time classic Western belongs in your library.  Highly recommended.",1219881600,,1040,4.770949720670391
3420557,5,B0018RWMNM,LD is probably the best western I have ever seen. If you see it once you will never forget it and will want to see it again & again. Robert Duvall is perfect for the part Gus.

3420559,5,B0018RWMNM,"I know that it has been said by thousands of folks but lets say it one more time. Lonesome Dove is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made. EVER. Robert Duvall as, no make that Robert Duvall is Gus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones is Captain Woodrow F. Call. They embark on a 2500 mile cattle drive from Texas to Montana to set up ranch and be cattlemen. Gus is the kind that likes to play cards and get pokes and Call is all about business. They were Texas Rangers together in the old days and have a friendship that we all wish we could have. Along with Jake Spoon, Deets, Newt, Dish and the very underrated Tim Scott as Pea Eye they go and re steal horses from the Mexicans and then head on their way to Montana. Gus is not thrilled about going but is on the trip for only one reason and that is to go and see his long lost love Clara Allen. Along the way you are introduced to the Indian outlaw Blue Duck, who has alluded Call and McCrae from their days as rangers, Sheriff July Johnson and his deputy Rosco along with other great characters. Every actor or actress who played in Lonesome Dove seems custom made for the part they play. In this movie you have some of the best supporting roles in movie history. You have Diane Lane as Lorie, Barry Tubb as Jasper Fant, Leon Singer as Bolivar the cook from Lonesome Dove, D.B. Sweeney, in one of the best character developments, as Dish Boggett, Rick Schroeder as Calls unclaimed son Newt and many others who are just as important to the story but just to many to name. I really don't have the time and space to tell you about all the great things about this movie so you will need to set aside 6 hours and sit back and enjoy the greatest movie ever made. Now onto the Blu-Ray disc. The movie was CROPPED to make it widescreen. There was a lot more taken off of the top and bottom then was gained on the sides. However the picture quality is outstanding compared to my old DVD. The extras on this disc are also way better than the original DVD. Overall a 5/5 movie and a 4/5 Blu-Ray.",1219449600,,2034,4.20460358056266
3420560,5,B0018RWMNM,I set my widescreen Monitor next to my standard TV screen.  I synched up the NEW Widescreen DVD right along side the old Fullscreen DVD.  I was shocked at how much more scenery & picture there is in this new version. THIS IS TRUE WIDESCREEN.  NOTHING HAS BEEN CROPPED !!!!  Don't believe me???  TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!!!,1219276800,,317,4.491228070175438
3420561,5,B0018RWMNM,"I believe I have some insight into this whole aspect ratio controversy. For many years, filmmakers filmed movies in something called ""Super 35."" The final, unedited and uncropped raw footage looks something like the old Chevrolet symbol, in that each scene was framed in both widescreen AND fullscreen ratios. The widescreen crop, of course, was released to theaters, but the fullscreen crop was released for home video consunption. I believe this to be the case with ""Lonesome Dove,"" as I have compared both the 2002 and 2008 versions, and information is both gained and lost in both incarnations, depending on the crop. It is no longer necessary to practice this hybrid process because of the proliferation of 16:9 TVs, so ""Super 35"" has virtually vanished.  However, this new version of LD is FAR superior to the first release, because of the stunningly clean, richly textured and colored, widescreen picture and the much improved sound. It's even more jaw-dropping than it's original edition - which is saying something. Throw in the letter-perfect performances by all(but ESPECIALLY so by Duvall and Jones)and you have an unqualified masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and check out the greatest western of all time, and one of the top 2 or 3 films ever made. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!",1218585600,,1302,5.027777777777778

Rather, it's the comically long-overdue digital remastering of this cinematic tour de force, and while admittedly imperfect, the stunning improvement from one edition to the next.  So I'm not going to quibble about aspect ratios; if you love this movie as much as most do, this is a release you must pick up, despite a few technical quirks the large majority of viewers will never notice.

3420564,3,B0018RWMNM,"If you are reading this, I expect you already know the movie is amazing and just want to know how it looks on blu-ray.  Well, its a bit better than the DVD, but generally disappointing visually compared with the comparable releases from the period that the studio has spend some time remastering.

I agree with other reviewers that the ""widescreen"" presentation is cropped.  In addition, the color and clarity is adequate, but not really of blu-ray caliber.  Vivid colors are lacking, there is visible grain,and the images don't really pop out like you see on many well-remastered older films.  It is probably the best Lonesome Dove out there, but no one in their right mind will choose this as their sample to show off their blu-ray player to a friend or relative, which is a shame because I think this could have been fantastic had the studio put some effort into it.",1218153600,,869,4.690789473684211
3420565,1,B0018RWMNM,"Regardless of the rationale for the 16:9 presentation, there's no question the framing on LONESOME DOVE is cropped. The bottom of the image is clearly cut off from its original television broadcast and it's very obviously NOT what was originally intended to be seen. As one of the other reviews mentions below, if you compare this with the DVD, it's evident that nobody would ever compose

That being said the BD is otherwise spectacular -- but why couldn't they have just given us the original, intended framing? Or at least every bit of the frame that was shot, if nothing else. That bottom portions of the screen that are clearly cut off is just inexplicable.",1218153600,,662,4.756521739130434
3420566,3,B0018RWMNM,"I rarely buy re-releases of a movie on DVD, but made an exception with ""Lonesome Dove."" My single favorite film (or series, if you prefer) of all time, I couldn't pass on the opportunity to upgrade from the previous 2002 DVD release, which I believe was literally copied from old VHS tapes.  The picture on this release is sharp and completely amazing, and I could go on for a full page just on the fantastic quality of the surround sound mix.  I can't say enough wonderful things about them.  The extras are also miles above those for the previous release -- save the omission of the emotional and moving interview with executive producer Suzanne de Passe, that really should have been included.  (I have yet to watch all the documentaries, however, so perhaps they included it in one of the longer features.)

But there's a serious flaw with this release, which others have already pointed out: It's not presented in the original aspect ratio.  I tend to get cranky when widescreen movies are taken and the sides are chopped off them to present a 4:3 pan-and-scan presentation.  But I've come to accept it.  I get downright irritated, however, when, in order to appease the current fascination with anamorphic widescreen, DVD producers take a fullscreen product and chop off the top and bottom to try to make it look like it was filmed in a ratio it clearly wasn't.  As I said earlier, I have both DVD releases of the production, so I was able to compare them side by side, and I don't care what Simon Wincer says in the interviews -- this is not a widescreen print.  Part of the picture was sacrificed to make the product fit this aspect ratio, and it's a crime.

In summary, I give this production mad props for the brilliant digital restoration, amazing sound quality, and extras.  The miniseries deserved it.  But this production loses at least two stars for butchering the original aspect ratio.  I hope that the producers digitally restored the entire feature before turning it into widescreen and that they'll eventually do yet another re-release, giving us the print the way it was always intended to be watched: in 4:3 format, suitable for standard TV viewing.

I am not a widescreen fanatic.  I just want to see things presented in the original aspect ratio.  Why is that asking too much?",1218153600,,2300,4.71
3420567,4,B0018RWMNM,"Good News - much improved picture quality and sound quality - on a truly classic movie that I've watched at least 25 times, and like many Lonesome Dove cult followers, can quote most scenes word for word.  There's hardly a day goes by that a LD quote doesn't apply to some situation.

Bad News - No matter what's been said elsewhere, the picture is cropped!  I've compared several scenes frame to frame, blue-ray to dvd, and the picture content horizontally is the same, but some portion of the top or bottom is missing on the wide-screen version.  Truly disappointing since, as many times as I've watched the film, I was looking forward to enhanced peripheral content that I've not yet seen.",1218067200,,692,4.694214876033058
3420568,5,B0018RWMNM,"I have been a fan since I first read the book and watched it in its premier broadcast on CBS.  When I am asked to name my favorite movie, I always cite Lonesome Dove (even though it is a made-for-television miniseries).  Today I purchased this newly-released Collector's Edition, even though I already own the 2000 Hallmark 2-disc release, and even though I suspected the touted ""widescreen"" had been accomplished by cropping/letterboxing.

After reading the handful of reviews here that seemed to contradict each other, I popped both discs in separate players to compare them with each other.  The good news is, the audio is remarkably crystal clear, a definite improvement.  The picture is also markedly superior, very sharp, and the color is brilliant.  On the older Hallmark version, the colors appear pale and washed out compared to the newer version, which has much deeper and richer tones, after remastering.

The bad news is, it is in fact cropped.  When I watched the two discs side by side, it is immediately apparent that part of the picture is missing at the top and at the bottom of the screen, in most scenes.  What is really strange, however, is that in some scenes part of the picture has been cropped from the (left and/or right) sides of the picture, as well.  There are some scenes in which the picture has been cropped on ALL FOUR sides of the picture.  I am not imagining this.  I was able to confirm this by playing/pausing the two versions side by side and noting that characters are sometimes in frame, other times not visible, parts of signs and lettering on signs are sometimes visible, sometimes not visible.  Objects visible in the older version may not be visible in the newer release.

Even stranger, in the new release, in some scenes one side of the frame may show less (on either the left or the ride side of the picture) in the new version (e.g. missing a person, or an object), but the other side of the frame may show people or objects that do not appear in the ""original"" 4:3 aspect.

Bottom line: it would appear that the original production was filmed in some aspect other than what was originally broadcast on network; this newer version ADDS some of the previously unseen aspect in some scenes, but in other scenes OMITS some of what was originally broadcast.  Still, the picture quality is really nice, and if you are as big a fan as I am of this, the greatest story ever told, it probably won't matter to you.  I will keep my older version copy, but I doubt I will ever have a reason to want to watch it instead of this one.",1217980800,,2567,4.5820568927789935

Seriously, the clarity, film quality and Dolby 5.1 surround make this Blu-ray a MUST HAVE for any fan of this Western epic!  It is in widescreen for the first time, and honestly, it makes the movie so much crisper and perfect that you seriously just have to see it for yourself to believe it!  The extra content on the discs are incredible too.  There are interviews, on-set, with the actors talking about the movie, and there are interviews with the author of the book and with the director of the film.  They are all so insightful, and you will learn things about this film that you never knew before.  But the picture and sound quality are beyond a doubt the best part of this.  Just buy it and you'll see for yourself!  Definitely get this movie on Blu-ray if you love this movie, because you'ver never seen Lonesome Dove like this!",1217894400,,1064,4.438144329896907

When I saw that the new DVD was in WS, I had hoped that it had been shot wide (perhaps for a possible European theatrical release) and then cropped to it's intended TV ratio, but alas...

Cropping the top and bottom of a 4:3 image is just as disrespectful to the original creator's intent as is cropping the sides of a wide image.  I hope that as widescreen TV's proliferate this doesn't become a trend.",1217894400,,728,4.37037037037037

I'm a big fan of westerns, going back to the Lone Ranger - and that's pretty much what this goes back to. Plotwise, it's episodic and simplistic, full of cornball events and ridiculous coincidences. The direction is boring and basic, the photography and scenery repetitious and forgetable. Everyone keeps running into everyone else on the trail to Montana, with dramatic timing that makes the whole yarn laughable. Apart from Duvall, who's superb, the characters are thin and cliched, no more than flesh and blood cartoons. By halfway through the second episode, I couldn't care less, and after Angelica Houston made her miscast entrance, the whole thing became unbearably sentimental, sluggish and silly. This is not an epic masterpiece by any stretch. The Godfather is an epic masterpiece. Or Star Wars, for that matter. This is a staid western ultra-lite.

3420580,1,B0018RWMNM,"This much cut down and butchered version of the Hallmark adaption of  Larry McMurty's great book left most of the meat on the cutting room floor.

Put up on two DVDs it is much shorter that the full six hour version.

In my opinion the book was great for all the detail it provided on the life and times of those living in the West in those days, and I especially appreciated the way the background of the characters and events were presented to flesh out the story. The Hallmark TV series on which these two DVDs are based was true to the book and IMO that is part of the reason it was so mesmerizing.

But in this version almost all the background has been omitted so you don't understand that Gus and Call were once famous Texas Rangers who cleared that part of Texas of the Indians, you are not shown the details of Gus and Clara's youthful relationship so when they finally meet you wonder why. No mention of the young Irish boys fear of snakes, which amplifies his being killed by snakes, almost all the data on July Johnson's search for the killer of his town's Mayor and his deputy Roscoe's adventures with his small, silent rock throwing partner is no where to be seen.

But the omission that I simply cannot forgive is total omission of Blue Ducks taking of the Lori and Gus rescuing her at the cost of Roscoe and the two children's lives. Not only is the action missing you are left wondering why the Lori is suddenly being taken care of by Gus and why she has become so withdrawn. You have been cheated out of the heart of the story.

Plus points of course are the great acting by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones.

I could go on but the best advice I can offer is to give this synopsis like version a miss and find somewhere the original uncut version of this glorious tale of the West.",1210636800,,1800,4.292035398230088

3420588,5,B0018RWMNM,"One of the great Westerns, albeit this time on the small screen not the large, this is a movie about aging in a decent way.  As much as the characters age, this is also a pivotal time for the genre of the Western itself, predicting the rise of the revisionist Westerns (Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven et al) at a time when no-one was interested in Westerns at all.  As such, the message of growing old in the face of adversity while keeping values intact is striking and as relevant as ever.
So what makes it work?  First, the epic scope of Larry McMurty's book which fits 6 hours of television so much better than it would have squeezed into a theatrical movie.  It breathes, takes its time and introduces characters in what at first feels a long drawn out way, but as the series progresses we thank it for giving us this time to get to know them.  As the cattle drive that propels the characters and story forward proceeds North, the events genually matter to us, thanks to a pitch perfect script.
Then there is the acting - Robert DuVall will surely forever be Gus.. and Tommy Lee Jones was near unknown when he was picked for this role which he plays to perfection, especially in the final episode when he takes his hardest ever journey, back to Lonesome Dove.  Not just these two, but Danny Glover, Diane Lane, and smaller roles by Chris Cooper, D.B. Sweeney, Robert Urich and others all exist in three dimensions, and all serve to create a real picture of a cowboys lifestyle.
Not least, there is the cinematography and music, both of which complement each other by never being showy but existing to provide a perfect setting for this character study.
It might seem a tad long - I know I thought so when seeing it at a younger age, but certainly not now... so if its fast paced action you want, go elsewhere - but for an affecting and perfectly acted exploration of dignity, values, romance and courage, switch on and lose yourself in Gus and Woodrow's world.

Extras are rudimentary but quite effective.  Interviews with producer and McMurty on the genesis of the project are interesting, but would have been better served by being compiled into a documentary, as the poor sound and dull setting belie the value of what is being said.",1205798400,,2241,4.557213930348259

3420605,5,B0018RWMNM,"Spoiler warning....

Warning to men: what Steel Magnolias is to women, Lonesome Dove will be to you. I have never in my life been as involved in a character as I was that of Robert Duvall's portrayal of Captain Augustus McCrae, the loud and poetic,  often boorish, sometimes gentle old former Texas Ranger. He made me laugh, he made me think, and, be it when I first say him on the screen as an eight-year-old, or now as a twenty-seven year old, he made me cry when he finally tells his lifelong friend Woodrow, ""It's been quite a party, hadn't it?"" and the usually stoic and hard Woodrow, leaning over the dying McCrae whispers with a spring of tears gliding down his cheeks, ""Yes, sir.""

Lonesome Dove is about the pursuit of life and the lengths we will go to find contentment as we furiously follow our own dreams and wanderlust, even at the expense of our own security. It is also one of the great tales of friendship told in an extremely original, raw way. Two men, both retired Texas Rangers, have decided to embark on the greatest journey of their lives as they leave a quiet south-Texas town and lead a group of cattle-hands north to be the first Americans to ranch Montana. It is their swan song of sorts, a fitting culmination of a life lived wild and passionate but always with the purity of exuberant effort.

It captivated, moved, and excited me almost twenty-years ago when I was a child and still does. I cannot think of a better western or a better tale of friendship between two men.",1199232000,,1501,4.487179487179487

3420607,5,B0018RWMNM,"Lonesome Dove appeared on a channel last Saturday and Sunday that I rarely view.  I had never seen this movie before--and was immediately transfixed by the epic Western landscape, the authentic costumes of the time, the vivid color, all reminding me of the paintings of that great artist of the Old West Frederick Remington. I wonder if its director and photographer had Remngton in mind when they shot both the scenes and the cowboys (and Indians). I was relieved to see that a ""half-breed"" Blue Duck (?) were not drawn in politically correct colors, to keep from offending Native Americans. There were bad Indians, as there were bad white hombres. Witness that sergeant of cavalry who tried to commandeer a kid's horse--and gor his comeuppance fo his pains. Duval and his buddy were peerless! I am surpised that none of the other knowledgeble reviewers didn't mention Remington--a great American painter and depicter of the Old West. There are several available website links to the artist along with repros of many of his paintings with subjects ranging from cattle drives to attacks on wagon trains. Also reminescent of Texas cattle drives as recorded in the works of Frank Dobie.",1197244800,,1184,4.97979797979798

Lonesome Dove  stars Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones in a western about two ex-Texas Rangers on a cattle drive to Montana.  It is based on Larry McMurty's book by that name.  To me it is one of the most realistic westerns ever made.

Recommended for fans of western movies.

3420609,5,B0018RWMNM,"I happened to catch this masterpiece again and was struck by how well it holds up. Although it has majestic sweep, and it is everything that an epic should be, it is in the small details that it proves faultless. One example stands out. Duvall is looking out over the plains at a herd of buffalo. He goes to chasing the herd and then comes racing back followed by a band of Indians. Just in this sequence, we go from the big dreams of the frontier to the tragic injuries that will take his life. The movie is filled with moments like this; actually, there are dozens of them given the length of the piece. So tied to this role is Duvall in my mind that I have trouble now enjoying him in anything else. He has those mannerisms - his way of sucking in air to control his emotions - that I associate with his part in this series and not with him as an actor. I can't think of a dramatic epic as well made. It was in fact both the best and the last of these mini-series. After ""Lonesome Dove"" the only great television has been the Ken Burns docudramas such as his recent ""War.""",1197158400,,1075,4.173076923076923

I love westerns; from John Wayne to Gary Cooper to Randolph Scott to Steve McQueen to Burt Lancaster to Kevin Costner, but I just have to say that Lonesome Dove is my all time favorite western of them all.
There is no greater story, no better production, no more captivating sequences than in this one.  It is the best, absolutely the best of the best.  Robert Duvall is spectacular as Gus.  Duvall is the real deal.  He is great in Broken Trail and Open Range, I mean really great, but Lonesome Dove is the pearl of his career.",1193529600,,620,4.318965517241379

3420614,5,B0018RWMNM,"I recently bought this for my dad for his birthday.  I remember watching it when I was younger and I always liked it, but the version we had was recorded from TV and was terrible quality, especially because it is now almost 20 years old.  It is an excellent series, but you can decide that for yourself if you choose to buy it.

My decision to write this review is designed to help the potential buyer who doesn't want to get ripped off.  I read most of the reviews before buying this product, and time and time again I came accross people who complained about purchasing an edited version with much of the content removed.  Many of those reviews were old, so I didn't know if I was getting a newer version with the whole story of some other version that was edited.  Hopefully this will help.

It appears that Amazon sells 2 versions of the DVD (I know nothing about the VHS versions so this review does not apply to them).  The version I bought (ASIN B00005Y6YB) is listed as 360 minutes in length and is ranked in the top 500 in Amazon's top sellers.  It was released by Hallmark.  The DVD box lists the run time as 6 hours, which is what you would expect after removing commercials an 8 hour TV miniseries that is split into 4 parts.  Amazon's price is listed as $8.49.

Another version of the series (ASIN B00003IPFK) is listed as 360 minutes as well, but is listed at about #48,000 in the top sellers and is priced at $13.75 (only available from independent vendors).  Seeing how few people bought this version and how much more it costs, I would avoid it.

The version I bought is ASIN B00005Y6YB and it is complete.  Perhaps the people who gave bad reviews did not receive the same version I bought.  Amazon lists the same reviews for both, so it's possible that people gave poor reviews to a different version and those reviews got mixed in with the complete version's reviews.  If you want to be sure you are getting the complete series without editing, I would recommend searching the ASIN so that you don't have to pick and choose between versions.  Be sure you check when you get the product that you have the full 6 hour version.  I hope this helps!",1189036800,,2163,4.416666666666667

The character interaction between Duvall and Jones makes this film the masterpiece that it is. As viewers, we are drawn into the lives of two lifelong fiends that are entering the twilight years of their lives. Former Rangers, they tamed the SW Border Territory together. Then disillusioned, spent their best years in the personal purgatory of Lonesome Dove...where their only source of amusement is getting drunk, getting laid by the town's only prostitute or stealing horses from across the border. Feats of valor forgotten, their self-respect diminished, they realize that life and opportunity have passed them bye. Both become determined to confront death one last time.

What occurs in this film is a keen examination of the love between two aging men, both agreeing to make a cattle drive to Montana and setup a ranch.....a perilous feat worth of recapturing their youth and self respect....but in reality, a journey from which they both hope not to return.

Many of us follow the same path, with friendships so old and close that one cannot easily discards one's obligation to the other. This is the common thread that rivets us to the screen .We are brought into the relationship of Call and McCrea to garner what the meaning of friendship is between two men who have known each other for so long.

Perfect casting, even to the most minor roles, a beautiful score by Basil Poulidaris, and Bill Witliff's amazingly taut script (yes, taut, even at this length) make this, along with Ken Burns' 'Civil War' documentary, the best made-for-TV productions I have ever seen. It is little wonder that Robert Duvall still claims that Augustus McCrae is the greatest role he has ever played, equating the part's depth and richness to that of Hamlet.

The scope of this story, which in some ways dwarfs the small screen and cries out for something larger, makes up in depth for what it lacks in breadth. The only thing more grand than the majesty of the West is the ability of the human heart to expand to fill it. Gus McCrae, Woodrow Call, Clara Allen, July Johnson and 'Deets' are all so real to me that their history disappears seamlessly into the history of this nation.

The production values, even from a 1989 TV event, are all on par with most theatrical movies, except for a few very minor ""special effects"" sequences which show some signs of age and budget constraints.

In my life, I have never seen a better, more human, more realistic, more emotionally connected story than Lonesome Dove.  Most Westerns, while they may have their dramatic merits, are unfortunately poor portrayals of the American West as it was in the 1800's.  They are almost always overly romanticized, melodramatic stories which have little resemblance to what it must have actually been like.

Lonesome outshines them all, finally presenting the Old West as it probably truly was.  A wild country filled with REAL people, living hard lives with real relationships, adventures, emotions and heartbreak.  In fact, Lonesome Dove outshines most all movies and series in general, not just westerns.

And don't get me wrong, while it certainly has its share of death, sadness and hardship, Lonesome Dove is a wonderful viewing experience, full of life, humor and adventure.

Lonesome Dove is my favorite movie.  Please give it a chance.",1151798400,,1628,4.988888888888889

The actings are superb, specially the leading roles (Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Angelica Huston and Diane Lane).

3420658,1,B0018RWMNM,"I should qualify my comments by saying I watched maybe an hour before I gave up and turned it off.  So to anyone who wants to take my opinion with a grain of salt, that's fair.

""Lonesome Dove"" is gritty and dirty, and I'm not just talking about the Texas dust.  It is definitely not for ""family viewing.""  Here, even the ""heroes,"" portrayed in a sympathetic, likable way, display some very questionable behavior:  Stealing cattle, shooting people (accidentally) and laughing about it, taking turns with the town prostitute.  I'm not saying this wasn't reality in the old west, but it wasn't THE only reality.

Call me old-fashioned, but I love a story where the protagonists aren't necessarily perfect, but are still admirable, even from the beginning.  They may make mistakes, but they learn from them.  They have honor, and respect for life and women.  (There was none of that here.)  This film seemed to wallow in all that was cheap and tawdry ... AND enjoy going there.  I'm not looking for a Disney-fied picture of the West, but at least part one of ""Dove"" showed little heart or soul.

I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of the film either.  The acting wasn't awful, but it was formulaic.  The script was just one line of bland dialogue after another.  There was very little humor, and what humor there is (two cute and nosy pigs, a cook that stubbornly rings an annoying bell at suppertime despite orders not to) is recycled over and over.  The pace was very slow, which is fine, but after one hour, very little had developed with the plot or the characters in a substantial way.

""Lonesome Dove"" can't hold a candle to ""The Big Country"" or ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" and other classic westerns.  There is something endearing about performers like John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart that Duvall and Jones don't have.  ""Lonseome Dove"" may have some redeeming qualities, but I don't have the patience to wait 9 hours to see them. Sorry.",1146355200,,1952,4.702064896755163

The ""acting chemistry"" between Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones as two old friends and former Texas Rangers could not have been performed any better by anyone else.  The greatest disappointment for me was that Tommy Lee Jones did not reprise his role in ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" - a role in my humble opinion that he was born to play.

Call walks across the bridge as the credits begin to roll she turned to me and said, ""is it all over? I wanted it to keep going!"" That statement is a great testimony to what a wonderful and moving story Lonesome Dove is.

This star studded movie is lead by the brilliant acting of Academy Award winning actors Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones as Captains Augustus McCrae and Woodrow F. Call, two former legendary Texas Rangers who embark on an epic journey from Texas to Montana to build a cattle ranch. Filling out this televised mini-series is other Academy Award winning actors including, Angelica Huston, portraying Clair Allen, Gus MaCrea's long lost love, and Chris Cooper, as Arkansas Sheriff July Johnson. Academy Award nominee Diane Lane portrays the sweet yet tragic Miss Lorena Wood who is trying to over come her current profession and find a more respectable life. Another Academy Award nominated actor, Frederick Forrest plays the evil half-Indian Blue Duck. The rest of the cast is a list of equally impressive actors; Danny Glover, Rick Schroder, Robert Urich, Barry Corbin, Steve Buscemi, Glenne Headly, and D.B. Sweeney.

The movie revolves around and is sustained by Duvall and Jones's characters. These two embody these characters and bring them to life as no others could. With a roller coaster ride of human emotion along the way, viewers will be drawn into this spectacular story and the rest of its captivating cast of characters as they live out the drama of this epic journey. The story is creatively woven as the synchronicities of each of the characters lives become entwined with one another. This movie will transport you back to the splendor and the tragedies of life in the American West of the 19th century and it will reveal why this time period holds such a fascinating hold on the minds of people today. This mini-series is a classic and it deserves to be. The quality of this movie is equal to, if not surpassing, any feature film that has been produced by Hollywood studios.",1143590400,,2120,4.8054794520547945

3420666,5,B0018RWMNM,"The Definitive Western.

Let's first start off by saying Lonesome Dove is the Western of Westerns.  Regardless if it had been a cinematic release (which would not have been done due to length, or the mini-series, the story is compelling and the filming and acting top-notch.  Any superlative that can be said has been said so no more need be said.

There have been reviews discussing editing vs. no editing so to satisfy myself a side by side by side comparison (original VHS to original full length DVD to newly released DVD) needed to be done.  What was found was there was editing.  No major clipping was done but there was some compression accomplished on some longer scenes where no dialogue was occurring.  But the series is intact.  This being said, you need to remember the original was not filmed for wide-screen since it was intended for television and wide-screen television did not exist except in concept twenty years ago, mono was standard so the stereo and dolby soundtracks are simulated for the majority of the film and any digital video or audio originated from analog film and tapes so you cannot and will not ever get pristine digital quality being reproduced. Again does this have impact on the film, nope unless you just want something to complain about.  All in all, the top of the line western.  Perhaps they just should have left everything alone and no one would have had to write anything.",1136851200,,1416,4.742857142857143
3420667,5,B0018RWMNM,"This miniseries has a bit of everything - great action, beautiful scenery, romance, wonderful bonds of friendship.  It's quite a journey & very entertaining all the way through.  Robert Duvall is an amazing actor.  Gus was a great character - very funny & real.

The characterization is great and Duvall's acting is superb.  What an artisan !  The only complaints I have are that the film is too grainy at times causing the transfer to suffer and the original special effects are just not good.  But these factors would not cause me to give it less than five stars because the movie is just so darn good.  Make time and watch this one.,1127347200,,502,4.287234042553192
3420671,5,B0018RWMNM,"I haven't watched any westerns in a long time but when I saw it at the local library, I thought I'd give it a whirl, especially with the cast headed by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, how bad could it be?  I was so blown away by their performance and just how rough and romantic they were.  It started my new found love of westerns.

Lonesome Dove is a must have, I had to have it for my own. I must have watched it at least 3 times already.  The performances by R. Duvall and T.L.Jones are classic and priceless. So far I have seen almost everything labeled Lonesome Dove but they have not come up to par of the first one, although they are entertaining and quenches my thirst for more of Lonesome Dove.  This dvd is a must have for any library!",1127088000,,749,4.137931034482759
3420672,5,B0018RWMNM,I just loved it. It was exciting and had the best actors. The unexpected always happened.,1126656000,,89,4.625
3420673,5,B0018RWMNM,"Robert Duvall's performance as Captain Augustus McCrae in ""Lonesome Dove"" is the finest of his career, which is saying something when you are talking about an actor who did memorable supporting roles in ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" to go along with Oscar nominated performances in ""The Great Santini"" and ""The Apostle,"" as well as winning an Academy Award for ""Tender Mercies.""  Actually, that last one may well be one of his lesser efforts, but that only speaks to the high regard in which the acting community holds Duvall.  When Duvall did not win an Emmy for this performance I was both stunned and outraged.  The Emmy went to James Woods for ""My Name Is Bill,"" which was certainly a fine performance, but not as memorable as Duvall's.  Maybe he lost votes to his co-star Tommy Lee Jones, who knows.

Having watched ""Lonesome Dove"" again I am still impressed by Duvall's performance and have developed a new respect for that of Jones as Captain Woodrow F. Call as well.  The problem the first time around was that I resented Call's character because he was still alive at the end and because he refuses to give Newt his name.  However, I am older now and more willing to accept Call's explanation that he put more value on his horse than he did his own name.  Besides, he did honor his promise to bury Gus back in Texas, and the irony between that return journey and the cattle trek that serves as the dramatic impetus for the narrative is important to the story Larry McMurtry is telling.  Fortunately, early on Gus McRae lets us know that the subject matter here is not death, but life.

Saying that ""Lonesome Dove"" is about an epic cattle drive does not really suggest how lyrical of a western this 1989 mini-series ended up being.  In the twilight of his life Woodrow Call is tired of living in the Texas border town of Lonesome Dove and decides to get himself a herd of cattle to drive to Montana, where they will be the first cattlemen to settle the new territory.  Call and McCrae hire on a team of cowboys, and set off.  Included in the group is trail scout Joshua Deets (Danny Glover), the patient Dish Boggett (D.B. Sweeney), and young Newt (Rick Schroeder), who McCall refuses to acknowledge as his son despite the insistence of Gus.  Following in their wake is Jake Spoon (Robert Urich), an ex-ranger who would rather spend time gambling, and Lorena Wood (Diane Lane), a prostitute who is on friendlier terms with Gus than Jake can stand.  Meanwhile, July Johnson (Chris Cooper), an Arkansas sheriff is on Jake's trail, unaware that his pregnant wife, Elmira (Glenne Headly) has taken off to find her first husband, who is not dead but in jail.  If that was not enough to keep life interesting on the trail, the infamous Blue Duck (Frederic Forrest) crosses their path as well.  Then there is Clara Allen (Anjelica Huston), an old beau of Gus's who lives on a ranch in Nebraska, which is just a stop along the way.

It is hard to measure triumph against the scale of tragedy in ""Lonesome Dove,"" especially given the high body count along the way.  But death only serves to give this epic its greatness, creating the foundation that allows Woodrow's realism to co-exist with the romanticism represented by Gus.  After all, that is what our vision of the Old West is all about.  For Call actions speak louder than words, which is why words fail him in the end with Newt, while Gus always has something to say and no lack of ways to express himself.  It makes sense to me now that Gus has to be dead by the final act of this story, because otherwise Call's silence would not be allowed to stand.  That is also why there is such poignancy in the final letter Gus writes to Lorie, who does not know how to read his final words and wants to put off having them read to her.  At the end of these six hours I am not sure if my criticism that it should have been longer is valid or if that simply recognizes the fact that I was loathe for the tale to end.  The special features on the DVD include interviews with novelist Larry McMurtry and producer Suzanne de Passe, a long section of textual notes regarding the history of cattle drives; a trivia game, and brief biographies and filmographies for the cast and crew.  All of these serve to extend the experience a bit longer.",1124582400,,4291,4.533073929961089

3420676,5,B0018RWMNM,"One of the best quotes from one of the best Westerns since ""Silverado"" brought the era of the western back to life.  There was such a HUGE backlash against westerns in Hollywood on the big screen and on television after True Grit and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It seemed like no one could come up with that winning formula that could keep people's attention.  I guess they were over run with westerns since films began.  (The very first film ever made was ""The Great Train Robbery"") And if I'm not mistaken Gunsmoke was the last successful western on tv.  No one was willing to finance or greenlight any type of western much less a mini-series.  Then came the Soul music powerhouse  MOTOWN of all companies to take the chance.

 This movie is wonderous and sweeping and the dialogue is so colorful and funny that it makes me giggle.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones argue and bicker like two old women through their many adventures so much that  it keeps you laughing  and then crying when one by one they loose those close to them while chasing what they KNOW is their last dream together.  Angelica Huston's performance as Clara is tender, hard and heartbreaking, while Diane Lane's performance as Lori is...well just plain heartbreaking.  This ensemble cast is beyond amazing.  Who' da thunk  it?  There are more Oscar winners  and big named actors in this mini series than I've seen in quite some time, all of them acting their collective asses off.  Chris Cooper, Angelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones,  Robert Duvall, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi, Diane Lane, Rick Schroeder give heart tugging performances and believe it or not even Robert Urich's acting will tear your heart out as the man who is the unintentional catalyst for the destruction and renewal of so many lives.  The whole story will keep you glued to your tv set.  This set the standard for others to follow as far as (Westerns) mini series go and to date,  I've not seen one yet that can fall into line behind it.

3420682,5,B0018RWMNM,"This is the brilliant 4-part tv miniseries 'Lonesome Dove', caught on DVD.  It is the story of a group of cowboys, led by long time best friends Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, trying to push a herd of cattle across the United States, from Texas to Montana.  With stars such as Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, and Angelica Houston, you are sure to have a quality movie.

I won't deny it -- I'm not a Western fan.  But this movie has changed my entire perspective.  I would have to say that this is my all time favourite movie.  It has all the basic elements - action, adventure, comedy, love, drama... combined to create one of the most amazing films of our time.  I never really knew much about the heart of american history, the wild west, until I saw this movie.

In some ways, I compare this film to the 'Lord of The Rings' series, in that most of the movie is literally gripping (other than the slow start at the beginning - in both movies), and at the end of each part, excluding the last, you feel very compelled to watch the next.  I have yet to meet someone who stopped watching the series part way through.  Other Westerns give this movie a bad name.  My joy gets a little more crunched every time I hear someone say that they hate westerns, therefore they would hate Lonesome Dove.  This is the way a real western should be.

Words cannot express how great this movie is.  I cannot stress the fact enough, and though I keep recommending this film to my friends and family, I wish everybody had the opportunity to experience the joy...  This is not a very well known movie, and I do not understand why -- I've seen hundreds of movies, and this old classic is still #1 in my books.  I guarantee that you will enjoy it, if you give it a chance.",1113782400,,1749,4.302752293577981
3420683,5,B0018RWMNM,"Lonesome Dove is full of characters as big as all outdoors, and none are bigger than Robert Duvall's Augustus MacRae and Tommy Lee Jones' Woodrow Call.

Gus and Woodrow have been together for decades and their dynamic together is almost like an old married couple.  Gus is still young at heart and full of vinegar, with a sharp eye for the ladies.  It's not hard to imagine why women young and old keep a special place in their hearts for Gus in this story.  Woodrow, by contrast, is all business, with no desire for women nor ""foolishness"".

They're tending a small corral just this side of the Rio Grande when their old riding partner Jake Spoon, played by Robert Urich rides up.  Jake tells Gus and Woodrow that Montana is a cattleman's paradise, and Woodrow gets a far-off look in his eyes as he dreams of one last adventure with his old friends, driving a herd of cows to Montana.  Gus can't be left behind by Woodrow, so to everyone's amusement Gus joins Woodrow's partnership.

Along the way to Montana they meet bandits and snakes and indians and we hear about Gus' old love Clara, who's up in Nebraska.  Clara is played by Angelica Huston, and when we finally meet her in the second act we can see why even an old ladies man like Gus still carries a torch for her.

Secondary roles are filled out by Chris Cooper, Danny Glover, Ricky Schroder, Diane Lane, Barry Corbin, Steve Buscemi, and others - and they make Larry McMurtry's world come alive.

The first two thirds of this made-for-tv-miniseries is as good as any Western ever made.

3420687,5,B0018RWMNM,"I imagine a lot of Amazon shoppers will be confused about the various reviews claiming that this DVD of Lonesome Dove is cut down and is not the full length, original version. Sadly, a lot of this is Amazon's fault, for erroneously listing the running time as 240 minutes (4 hours). This is absolutely incorrect. Having just ordered this and watched it, I can say that it is the original 6 hours-and-change version (the extra 2 hours from the original 8 miniseries coming from commercials).

As far as the quality of this movie, I don't believe I can add anything else that hasn't been said. I can sum it up with: you can't go wrong with this DVD. For $11 and change, it has got to be one of the greatest bangs for your buck in entertainment value you can buy on this website.",1107129600,,776,4.388888888888889
3420688,4,B0018RWMNM,"There isn't much I can add to the body of comments about the movie/mini-series itself.  Truly one of the great western sagas of all-time.  Great drama, great scenary, truly beautiful musical score.  Perhaps not the most politically correct show of all-time, towards Native Americans and women, but given the story is told from the perspective of frontiermen, that isn't all that out of line.

Without hestitation I rate the movie a 5 out of 5 stars.  A must-see western.

However the video quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired.  It really isn't much better than watching it on TV or on a VCR. Most DVDs, even those of a TV movie, are better than this.  So on DVD quality, I give it only 2 stars out of 5.

Still a great movie and worth purchasing to have in your collection, but it is disappointing that the video quality is mediocre.  Probably still fine on a 32"" or smaller TV for most.",1101772800,,901,4.47239263803681

3420690,5,B0018RWMNM,"One of my favorite movies ever. Duvall is one of my favorite actors and he has given many great performances in his career, but his portrayal of McCrae is nearly unbelievable. And as for Tommy Lee Jones, other than Coal Miner's Daughter, he has not done anything else that even comes close to his portrayal of Woodrow Call, NOT EVEN CLOSE! The interaction and contrast of these 2 actors and characters is outstanding. Although these 2 are the stars and lead characters of the movie, all the actors and characters are magnificent, and I don't say that lightly.

It is hard to express how good this movie is. Adventurous, funny, sad, dramatic, melancholy, moving, beautiful, and yes.....long. The funny thing with me was that as long as the movie was, I hated to see it end.

The gushing reviews written here are real and sincere, not phony, hyped up reviews. If you are wondering why the reviews consist of much acclaim and admiration, but of little detail as to the content of the movie, it is because the movie is far too big for that. That may sound a little convenient, but this movie is truly an epic and cannot be compared to the Westerns of the past. As good as many Westerns have been, Lonesome Dove is simply superior in practically every category...again, I do not say that lightly.

If you are a movie buff, whether you like ""westerns"" or not, or if you like Duvall or Jones, you are cheating yourself if you do not watch this one. There is a reason why there is so much acclaim here among those who have actually seen the movie.

Edit: Jones has been excellent in some more recent movies I have seen - No Country for Old Men , In the Electric Mist, In the Valley of Elah,  The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. Some I liked more than others, but Jones was terrific. Duvall is always terrific.",1099699200,,1806,4.4939024390243905

There are a couple of minutes under 6 hrs of running time not including the credits.

3420692,5,B0018RWMNM,"Lonesome Dove is a classic western based on the novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry.  Lonesome Dove tells the story of two former Texas Rangers, Captain Augustus McCrae and Captain Woodrow F. Call.  When one of their old friends shows up telling how beautiful the Montana territory is, they decide to drive a herd of cattle all the way from the Texas border on the Rio Grande to Montana.  Along the way, the Hat Creek Outfit and its herd must deal with renegade Indians, sandstorms, horse thieves, countless rivers, long periods of time with no water, and much more.  This has always been one of my favorite movies, not just a miniseries or western.  The movie blends great characters, a perfectly interwoven story, and plenty of action.  Remaining very true to McMurtry's epic novel, Lonesome Dove does not shy away from showing things like they really were.  By the end, characters you have come to love have died.  This is a can't miss western that will please almost all moviegoers.

  What makes Lonesome Dove special is the casting, from its two main leads all the way to the bit supporting characters.  Robert Duvall was born to play the part of Captain Augustus McCrae, the wise-cracking, lazy, ladies man.  Gus has too many great lines throughout the movie to even mention.  Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as Captain Woodrow F. Call, the hard-nosed, no nonsense, Texas Ranger.  The chemistry between Gus and Call provide many of the high points of the movie.  The excellent supporting cast includes Danny Glover as Josh Deets, the tracker/scout for the herd, Diane Lane as Lorena Wood, a sporting woman who goes along on the drive, Robert Urich as Jake Spoon, the smooth talking, card playing friend of Gus and Call, Frederic Forrest as the renegade outlaw Blue Duck, D.B. Sweeney as Dish Boggett, a love sick cowboy, Rick Schroeder as Newt, the young cowboy trying to become a man, Angelica Houston as Clara Allen, the love of Gus' life, Chris Cooper as Sheriff July Johnson, and Tim Scott as Pea Eye Parker.

  The two-disc DVD offers a decent looking fullscreen presentation, interviews with Lonesome Dove author Larry McMurtry and executive producer Suzanne de Passe, cast and crew information, production notes, a trailer for the miniseries, and an interactive western trivia game.  It goes without saying that if you're a fan of the movie, check out the novel.  This is one of the few movies where you can say the movie was as good as the book.  For a classic western with a great cast, fantastic story, and plenty of action, check out Lonesome Dove!",1096675200,,2566,4.770975056689342
3420693,5,B0018RWMNM,"A few years ago I had the opportunity to speak personally with Robert Urich about his role as the ill-fated Jake Spoon in the epic western LONESOME DOVE. Simply put, he said that it was ""the most fun I have ever had making a movie. Think of it. Riding and shooting every day with two of the greatest western stars ever: Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones! I won't have that much fun ever again."" Urich then added,""It is probably the greatest western ever!"" I am sure that he could have gone on for hours but, unfortunately, time would not permit. The look on his face and the light in his eyes said it all. Tragically Urich passed away a year or two thereafter.

But, thinking back, I agree wholeheartedly with Urich's assessment of LONESOME DOVE.

The legend and the story live on in the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Larry McMurty and in this faithful video depiction of the classic story.

A star-studded cast, headed by Duvall, Jones and Urich, along with one of the most beautiful western soundtracks ever composed make LONESOME DOVE a viewing experience that you will enjoy time and again.

3420694,5,B0018RWMNM,"Lonesome Dove is a sweeping, majestic saga about two old(er) former Texas Rangers - Augustus ""Gus""McRae (Robert Duval) and Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones) who decide to embark on a cattle drive after years spent in a sleepy ""little fart"" of a bordertown on the Rio Grande River.

Robert Duvall, a great actor, has perhaps come up with the role of his lifetime as Gus, a man who enjoys nothing more than a good ""poke"" with whores and drinking good whiskey. A magnificent character who comes to life both on the screen and in the book.

Captain Woodrow F. Call (Tommy Lee Jones) on the other hand couldn't be more different. I'm not sure that Call has anything resembling a sense of humour and he possesses zero tolerance for lawlessness, lazy workers and any activity that doesn't involve a purpose i.e. drinking and whoring.

I love westerns so it was only natural that I would fall under the spell of this movie. However, I can say with absolute certainty that this would be an impossible movie for anybody - men or women - to dislike.

There's no shortage of action in this movie and the exploration of the relationships between both the me and the women is done very, very well.

In addition to the main characters - Gus McRae and Woodrow Call, there is also a number of standout performances by many other wonderful cast members.

The late Robert Urich, for example, is excellent as Jake Spoon, a Ranger friend of Gus and Woodrow who, unfortunately, is the architect of his own demise. Jake is a character who shares some of the same traits as Gus - drinking, whoring, avoiding hard work - however, he lacks Gus'moral code when it comes to law and order and crosses the line when he falls in with some bad characters who go on a killing spree. When he and his new ""friends"" are finally caught by Gus and Woodrow, it serves as one of the most poignant moments in the film.

Danny Glover is also excellent as the dependable and personable Deets, a friend and tracker of Gus and Woodrow who has worked for them for many, many years.

Anjelica Huston plays a ""sassy"", no nonsense former love interest of Gus, a notorious womanizer, who represents the truly independant spirit, which many pioneer women possessed. When they were younger, Gus and Huston's character fell in love, however, poor Angelica could never compete with Woodrow, who she blames for keeping her and Gus apart. I guess poor Gus could never se himself as settled down with a wife and children.it would have infringed on his ability to drink and enjoy the whores he has such a good time with.

Little Ricky Schroder plays Newt, an orphan who is looked after by Gus and Woodrow. Unknown to him, Newt is the illegitimate son of Woodrow, although Woodrow will never admit it to either himself or his son. One suspects that Newt is the product of a love affair that Woodrow once enjoyed, but never materialized into something more meaningful and now carries this terrible regret with him.

And finally, we have Diane Lane, a young sporting woman named Lorrena, who is also captivated by Gus and his personable ways. Unfortunately, Gus is unable to deliver anything more with her than he was with Huston's character and she qucikly falls in with Jake Spoon, who promises her a better life outside of Lonesome Dove. Of course, Jake is a leaky vessel - thoroughly undependable - and much prefers nice shirts and card games to responsibility.

This wonderful and captivating story depicts the trial and tirbulations of a 2,000 mile cattle drive complete with outlaws, the forces of nature, indians and a host of other factors which the cowboys of the late 19th century had to contend with.

This is perhaps one of the most authentic westerns ever made by America film makers. It's a panoramic 6 hour epic film which is almost impossible to step away from once you've started to watch it.

So it you've never seen it before and you happen to insert the film into your DVD player, be prepared to put your life on hold for about 6 hours and sit back and enjoy this wonderful, wonderful film..!!",1091836800,,4050,4.631799163179917

3420701,5,B0018RWMNM,"I have just finished watching the six hour Lonesome Dove for the fourth time; yet, it is a rare movie I will even watch twice. I own the DVD, and I will certainly be watching it a fifth time. Comparisons of Lonesome Dove to other TV movies don't begin to do it justice; this movie deserves comparison to any Western ever made, and it stands up well to any one of the most highly considered (The Searchers, Unforgiven, Shane, High Noon, The Good, The Bad & the Ugly, etc.). This is a story of character and nuance much more than plot and action, with many small moments that will stay with you long after the story is finished...a saloon owner grieving over the loss of his prostitute (his love)...the hanging of a friend...an attempt at telling a boy he is your son....the burial of a friend...two old warriors saying goodbye in so many words (while there is much humor in the story, there is also overwhelming sadness, and do expect very major characters to have tragic endings to their lives). Lonesome Dove is bold enough to tell an epic story (and in doing so, demytholyzing the history of the West, and showing us how brutal and painful the settling of the West really was) by focusing on these small moments. There are something like 75 or 100 speaking parts in this movie, and it is uniformly excellently cast (with the exception, in my opinion, of Angelica Huston, who I always thought seemed out of place in this Western setting). If you are wondering whether this is worth owning, believe me, you will never regret it.
A postscript: since I wrote my review I have noticed that there are a number of idiots out there unfairly ripping this movie for being shorter than the original. The original series was indeed EIGHT hours long. However, it was made for TV and had something called commericials. These had the effect of reducing its running time to about SIX hours, as my review notes. I have seen several DVD versions of this and have never seen one that was edited or cut, which is why they neglect to warn you on the box. Just get the movie, watch it, and ignore the bozo comments.",1077840000,,2095,4.515789473684211

I just purchased this DVD, (which by the way is of excellent quality) and the family sat down four nights in succession to watch the whole epic. We were all stunned. If Oscars were given for television, Robert Duvall would have gotten the Oscar for his work here.  He was just the best. Tommy Lee and Danny Glover and Diane Lane were all excellent - as was the entire cast...I mean really - Anjelica Houston was wonderful.  The casting was one of a kind, and I am going to skip the ""sequels and prequels"" because they could never match the story I became entranced with enough to recommend to everyone I know.  The extras are also interesting, especially the conversation with Larry McMurtry.  I had never read anything by him, and now I can't wait to start reading just a few of his books to sample this wonderful storyteller in the print form.
I would not recommend ""Lonesome Dove"" for young children or the squeamish, as there are many extremely sudden incidences of violence and death, very sad in context and probably very much in tune with the realities of the setting.  Certainly the epic doesn't glamorize the time and place, but ""Lonesome Dove"" is about character, and we find all too little of that around us in our time.",1077148800,,1328,4.5125

They embark on a 2500 mile cattle drive from Texas to Montana to set up ranch and be cattlemen. Gus is the kind that likes to play cards and get pokes and Call is all about business. They were Texas Rangers together in the old days and have a friendship that we all wish we could have. Along with Jake Spoon, Deets, Newt, Dish and the very underrated Tim Scott as Pea Eye they go and re steal horses from the Mexicans and then head on their way to Montana. Gus is not thrilled about going but is on the trip for only one reason. To go and see his long lost love Clara Allen. Along the way you are introduced to the Indian outlaw Blue Duck, who has alluded Call and McCrae from their days as rangers, Sheriff July Johnson and his deputy Rosco along with other great characters. Every actor or actress who played in Lonesome Dove seems custom made for the part they play.
In this movie you have some of the best supporting roles in movie history. You have Diane Lane as Lorie, Barry Tubb as Jasper Fant, Leon Singer as Bolivar the cook from Lonesome Dove, D.B.

But Lonesome Dove fans deserve a better transfer of this film to DVD.  The original broadcast on CBS wasn't crystal clear with eye popping colors either but it was certainly better than this murky hazy looking print.  Other studios have taken important groundbreaking mini-series like Roots (and most recently Shogun) and gave them stunning transfers that look even better than the original broadcast.  And Roots and Shogun first aired more than 10 years before Lonesome Dove!!  Lonesome Dove the book and the TV series has become part our collective memory of the Mythological American West.  And has done as much to make us rethink Hollywood cliches about Westerns as Unforgiven or previous Westerns by Leone, Peckinpah, Hawks, or Ford.
I'm glad its at least available on DVD.  But I can't help but say this series simply deserves better.  Why do I care?  Again, its an ""important"" Western.  And for selfish reasons as well.

3420714,5,B0018RWMNM,"First, please read Larry McMurtry's excellent original novel. It is a rich tapestry of characterization, language and vivid descriptions of place. Simultaneously brutal and lyrical LONESOME DOVE is one of the finest American works of literature ever produced. That said the film version stands as one of the greatest novel to film adaptations ever made.
Capturing much of the rich novel's immense depth and vision, this epic film is perhaps one of the finest dramatic pieces ever created for television. Clocking in at over six hours, this film never drags and possesses, with the exception of THE WILD BUNCH, simply the finest ensemble acting ever seen in the Western Genre.
Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones give textbook examples of effective film acting. The literal volumes they communicate about the human soul with only a blink of an eye or the wave of a hand stand as a lasting testament to the art of acting. Granted while McMurtry's brilliant omniscient point of view is lost for the camera, Duvall and Jones and the rest of the cast completely capture each characters'dynamic inner life.
The film also contains standout performances from Angelica Huston, Danny Glover, Tim Scott, Diane Lane, Rick Schroeder, Chris Cooper, Steve Buscemi and many others.
In a perfect world this would have been produced for the big theatrical screen in 70mm widescreen. The framing and cinematography do appear sadly cramped for such a sprawling work. Such is the case with a film made for television.
On that note, the DVD possesses a rather poor transfer that renders the film rather shallow visually.
Still this is but a small matter as LONESOME DOVE is as close to the American Odyssey as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and other great literary works. The timeless theme that life is full of changes is brought home in a most profound, beautiful and ultimately entertaining package. Simply put, this is not a film to be missed, it is to be sought out and treasured like the dearest family heirloom.",1058486400,,1984,4.925373134328358
3420715,5,B0018RWMNM,"See also McMurtry's book of the same title. The film is exceptionally faithful to the book. But see the movie first, because Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones fit the two main characters perfectly: you'll hear their voices as you read the book (warning to Germans: don't buy a dubbed version of the film!). No one can write about Texas like McMurtry, and no actor can play a Texan like Duvall! What's it about:? The short transition period from the time of the outlaws (the lawmen were also outlaws now and then, as is portrayed in the film) and Indians, and the transition to the boring money-civilization of banks, shopkeeping, and corporate ranching. In this connection, see also the oral histories collected in the fine book 'In Their Own words'. My Geman wife hates kitch, smells it a mile a way, and loves both Lonesome Dove and The Evangelist, both played by Duvall. She also loves West Texas but hates the fences there. There's much more freedom of motion in Europe than in the fenced-in U.S. In Europe, you can walk across a farmer's land without asking permission, whereas in Texas you shouldn't.",1054857600,,1106,4.7357512953367875
3420716,5,B0018RWMNM,"I hereby thank a good friend of mine for introducing me to this very fine film, which indeed deserves high honor in the TV miniseries Hall of Fame.  LONESOME DOVE, a sprawling and picturesque epic set in the old American West, is based on a novel of the same name by author Larry McMurtry.
This is a saga of two friends, retired Texas Rangers Augustus McCrae (Robert Duvall) and Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones), who dare ensue seeking out what fellow former Ranger Jake Spoon (Robert Urich) has described as a ""cattleman's paradise"" - the virgin wilderness of Montana.  Before long they're off, stealing back from thieves across the border large herds of cattle and horses, readying themselves for a journey that's quite destined to become -more or less- the great American odyssey.  This bold undertaking, originating in the southwest of Texas, is reckoned to end - once having conquered the vast unforgiving wilds of Indian country - in the rich wide openness of western Montana.  Gathering a motley crew of cowboys and other notables:  among them an old comrade in arms, Joshua Deets (Danny Glover), Captain Call's illegitimate and unacknowledged son Newt (Rick Schroder), the town's kind-hearted prostitute, Lorie (Diane Lane), and Gus's two pet pigs, Gus and Captain Call embark upon their grand ambitious trek.
It is a trek filled with unrelenting adventure - fraught throughout with quirky happenstance, scenic romance and omnipresent danger.  In addition to horse thieves, snakes, and Indians, Gus and Call must contend with a vicious, murderous half-breed named Blue Duck (Frederic Forrest).  Also, in an interesting sub-plot, the ne'er do well Jake is pursued by a sheriff from Arkansas for an accidental murder committed there.  However this sheriff, July Johnson (Chris Cooper), soon changes his course after finding out his pregnant wife had run off on a whiskey boat in pursuit of a wastrel lover.  Meanwhile, after having rescued Lorie from the clutches of Blue Duck and his gang of nasty villains, Gus makes room in his ample heart for the love of two women: Lorie, who's evermore from that moment devoted to him, and Clara (Anjelica Huston), an old flame he intends to visit while en-route to Montana.
Just as Dickens did, McMurtry fleshes his characters out - even the minor ones - and gives them souls.  Gus and Woodrow are, in particular, drawn forth with amazing depth and insight - Gus's warm sensibility plays perfectly off Call's stern straightforwardness, and it makes for a friendship that is rich, pure and patent.  Truly Duvall must be a real cowboy at heart, and the role of Gus McCrea was just made for him!  And Tommy Lee Jones was absolutely stellar.  My favorite minor character is Janey (Nina Siemaszko), a girl from Arkansas who chucks rocks with perfect aim at a scurvy bunch of backwoods outlaws trying to rob her new friend - my 2nd favorite minor character - Deputy Roscoe Brown (Barry Corbin).
The acting is actually superb throughout, which I suppose should well be expected from such a first rate cast:  two with Oscars already tucked under their belts (Duvall and Huston), two future Academy Award winners (Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper), as well as a future Oscar nominee (Diane Lane) - it lends no insignificant amount of credit to a television movie when there are actors of such renowned caliber starring in it.
I cannot say this film was quite as moving as I had expected it to be - though realistically portrayed, some of the tragedy seemed too coincidental or, in some subtle way, even contrived.  Yet, although this movie is somewhat slow and slightly dry at the beginning, it does gradually warm into an alluringly endearing glow by the end: a spark lovingly fanned along the way by Basil Poledouris's exquisite score.  The dry dusty landscape is exquisitely filmed, and much of the dialogue is woven with bits of subdued genius.  Overall, I must say that though this is a brutally honest drama, it is possessed, much like Homer's Odyssey, of a mythical quality all its own.",1054339200,,4028,4.908689248895435

3420721,5,B0018RWMNM,"I strongly believe that if Lonesome Dove had been released as a theatrical movie rather than a TV miniseries it would have been considered one of the most commercially and critically successful films of all time.  Not that it would have been feasible to do- 6 hours still barely does it justice.  Maybe the success of The Lord of the Rings will convince Hollywood that people are willing to see long books adapted into lengthy, multi-part movies if done properly.  Anyway, Lonesome Dove is simply one of the best movies that I've ever seen- the fact that it aired on TV doesn't diminish that at all.  It has Titanic-sized production values, with top notch acting, writing, design and even music.
Before you watch the movie, read the book.  Don't let the argument ""the movie is never as good as the book"" stop you, because in this case they are worthy equals.  This sounds silly, but when I first watched the miniseries it felt as if someone had tapped my imagination to make adapt the book exactly as I had envisioned it.  Every actor, every set, every line, every costume, every location is exactly as I imagined.  Robert Duvall IS Gus.  Tommy Lee Jones is Capt. Call (even though he does look like Kenny Rogers).  Some actors who are normally associated with TV roles give bigscreen caliber performances- Robert Urich and Rick(y) Schroeder hold their own with Duvall and Jones.  Even the minor characters are perfect- only a few are left out.  And you'll recognize several stars who appeared before they were more famous:  Steve Buscemi, Chris Cooper, Diane Lane.
And be prepared to relive the devastation and heartbreak of the book all over again.  Without giving away anything, this is a brutal, tragic and sad, sad movie.  Bring that box of kleenex.  Yet it's not sentimental or manipulative- like the book, it rings true of real life.  The events aren't happy, but they work out just as they would in life.  That, I think, is where the perfection of McMurtry's story lies.  Like Terms of Endearment, things happen to these wonderful characters just as you'd expect, even if you hope that they won't.
This is a fine, fine movie that will hopefully hold up as a modern classic.  My only complaint is that the DVD transfer is subpar.  I don't know how well they could upgrade the sound or the picture since it was filmed for a TV screen, but hopefully someday it will be given its due with 5.1 sound, a director's commentary (6 hours of it!) and maybe even a widescreen format.",1043712000,,2480,4.668202764976958

But I just watched it on tape for the first time having borrowed it for free from the library. After an hour or so I got past the poor video and was lost in this amazing film!
 My recommendation is to purchase the DVD. You say you ain't got a DVD player? Buy one immediately. They're coming down in price all the time and their picture reproduction is beautiful.

3420724,5,B0018RWMNM,"Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove is a fascinating read and an equally fascinating miniseries or movie. Starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston, and a fascinatingly different Robert Urich, it is well acted with many fine supporting actors including Diane Lane, Frederic Forrest and Rick Schroder. Well-researched and thorough, the filmmakers have faithfully followed the book and presented a movie that is beautifully filmed and also surprisingly ""educational"" for want of a better word. Most people didn't make a big deal out of hygiene, for example, in the days of this story, medicine was in it's early days and people died from illnesses and injuries that they would be able to survive in our day and age and the minutiae of the dialogue and fine nuances to the performances give you as much of a sense of living in a different era as any movie ever has.",1039564800,,872,4.938775510204081
3420725,5,B0018RWMNM,"I've seen LONESOME DOVE so many times I've practically got the six hours of dialogue memorized.  Yet I'll keep watching this excellent adaptation of Larry McMurtry's epic novel, over and over again.  Why?  Two words:  compelling story.
The friendship of Augustus McCrae and Woodrow F. Call is the underlying theme of LONESOME DOVE; it's the motor that drives the story.  When these two weathered former lawmen steal a herd of cattle from Mexico and set off for Montana for one last grand adventure (""I wanna see that country,"" says Call to Gus, ""before the lawyers and bankers get it.""), the stage is set for a Western with plenty of humor, action, violence...tragedy.
This production makes McMurtry's unforgettable characters literally leap off the page.  Robert Duvall IS Gus McCrae...Tommy Lee Jones IS Woodrow Call.  Both performances are so vivid and on target the viewer is transported seamlessly to McMurtry's story, a story centering around the undying loyalty and friendship of these two men.
LONESOME DOVE is a film that will entertain you, take you over the full gambit of human emotions, then after six hours leave you begging for more.  Jones and Duvall lead a stellar cast in a remarkable film that has but one weakness:  it has to end.  And McMurtry's story is told--told so well that no other Western even comes close.",1038873600,,1334,4.941704035874439

The Pulitzer-prize winning novel is excellent, too.  Watching this film or reading the book is a big, delicious, chocolate mental dessert, with a cherry on top.

I've seen all the Clint Eastwood westerns, Shane, Rio Bravo, Red River, The Searchers, The Magnificent Seven, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and I can say unequivocally that Lonesome Dove is the best western 've ever seen.  All the performances are great but Robert Duvall's Gus McRae is absolutely indelible and has become my favorite character in film no matter what the genre.  Certainly Lonesome Dove had an advantage over the aforementioned western films by being a mini-series and thus having more time to develop the characters and story, but the production values and performances rival those of the finest film.  We should rejoice that it was a mini-series because there was no other way that true justice could be done to the great novel it was adapted from.  It has both scope and intimacy, unbearable cruelty and immeasurable tenderness, romantic dreams and crushing reality.  I've never seen six hours go by so fast.  It is the best western ever.",1037491200,,1151,4.896907216494846
3420728,5,B0018RWMNM,"Based upon the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Lonesome Dove is the best adapted novel of all time for any screen.  I personally despise seeing any film based upon a novel that I have read due to the inconsistencies between the novel and the screen version.  Lonesome Dove, the novel, not only captures the spirit of the old west better than any other novel I have ever read, but the mini-series nearly follows the novel page for page.
What makes the screen version so much better is the fact that the acting is first rate.  Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones  legitimized their casting with first rate performances.  Their roles were originally written for John Wayne and James Stewart, but I don't think that the performances of those actors could have equaled Duvall and Jones.  Diane Lane had the perfect demeanor for the beautiful but esteemless prostitute who is forever to be abandoned.  Robert Urich, the eternal good guy was perfect as the scheming weak-willed former Ranger.  I'm not certain how Lonesome Dove faired at the Emmy's, but it certainly should have won in every category for which it was eligible.
If you want to see a well acted tale of the old west in which the time period is legitimately portrayed, see Lonesome Dove.  If you don't want to be disappointed by a film that was adapted from a novel you have read, see Lonesome Dove.  There is no aspect of this film that takes away or attempts to enhance the novel from which it was adapted.  Do yourself a favor and see Lonesome Dove.",1033171200,,1505,4.6415094339622645

A week ago, I went on a beach vacation and re-read the book.  The book is significantly richer than the film, an absolute masterpiece.  It's the kind of book that, even if you hardly ever read anything, you will enjoy reading after seeing the movie made from it.",1032739200,,556,4.53

3420735,5,B0018RWMNM,"How many times have we all gone to see a movie adaptation of a book and exited the theater with the words, ""it was all right, but the book was better,"" on our lips?  Very few Hollywood writers and producers can ever make a movie script as good as a novel.  Not so with Lonesome Dove!  Never before in all my reading and viewing of fiction, have I laughed and cried so hard for a group of characters.  Although the screen play was not written by Larry mcMurtry, the author of the award-winning novel, the screen writer did a wonderful job in trimming down this epic novel into a movie script that captures the spirit of a beautifully crafted tale of friendship, adventure and love.  Everything from the music, to the cast, to the visuals make this a must-see for both fans of the book and for those who have never enjoyed westerns.  It is a tale of two ex Texas Rangers, Captain Augustus McCrae, (Robert Duvall)  and Captain Woodrow Call, (Tommy Lee Jones) who give up ranching in the town of Lonesome Dove, Texas, steal horses from a Mexican bandit and start out on a cattle drive for Montanna.  They take with them and encounter along the way, a vast assortment of characters who make the trip all the more enjoyable for the viewer.  Some notables among these are the renegade, Blue Duck, portrayed perfectly by Frederic Forrest, who brings this cruel villain to life straight from the pages.  Also, Clara Allen, palyed by Angellica Houston, who is the strong-willed old flame of Gus.  The two things that stand out the most for me in this movie are the wonderful musical score, composed by Basil Poledouris, and the depiction of the life-long friendship between Gus and Call.  Friendship has been the theme of countless stories, but seldom is it portrayed so vividly, without being overly sappy, as it is in a story.  I always come away from the movie feeling that friendships like that of Gus and Call are as easy to find today as a cattle drive.  Another outstanding quality of the book and movie is the feel of authenticity the writers and crew bring to it.  While certain aspects of the movie are a bit cliche, (Gus riding off to save the lady in distress), other aspects are very real, (the water moccasin episode and Jake's hanging).  These qualities, both real and fiction blended together, make Lonesome Dove a truly epic tale that can accurately be called an American classic.

The soundtrack is breathtaking.  The one weak spot is the casting Frederic Forrest (an otherwise very capable actor)as Blue Duck.  He does not bring the menace that was so haunting in the novel.

Well, be warned, an intellectually challenged movie distributor has decided to edit 2 hours from Lonesome Dove! That is like touching up the Mona Lisa!
This miniseries was unique and may never again be equalled, at least in the Western genre. It is 6 hours of riveting televison, and trust me on this folks, you can't find 5 minutes of this former miniseries to edit out. To cut anything out was a serious diservice to anyone who has not experienced this.
Probably what I liked most was the thoroughly convincing portrayals of this cast. There were none who did not project an aura of believability, and each was so convincing that you may forget you are sitting in front of your television. I remember the time I rented this 6 hour series in 1994 not knowing what to expect. What I found was I did not get up from my couch for 6 hours. I was moved by the entire movie, and rarely does any movie elicit emotion in me. Gus McRae and Woodrow Call, backed by an absolutely fantastic supporting cast, will bring your televison to life.
Towards the end, when Woodrow is doing a favor for Gus, and doing so at the risk of his own life, the whole West hears of his exploits. In some dusty cow town somewhere, a local sees him, and reading of the story, questions Woodrow Call.
""Just why are you doing this anyway?"" he asks. Call looks back and says ""Because I gave him my word."" The local, thinking for a second, looks back and says ""I can see that you did"" and walks away. It is a perfect description of the character of Woodrow Call.

It is an escape from everyday life through simple dialogue and lovable believable charachters that carry the reader away from his world and place him in Lonesome Dove, Texas, a place where life is slower and the hustle and bustle of modern life cannot be found. It's all-star cast led by Danny Glover, Tommy Lee Jones, and Robert Duvall present the charachters as Mcmurtry would have portrayed them. In my opinion, it is impossible to watch the entire six hour classic without tearing up or at least being thoroughly moved, not by its sadness but by its superb portrayal of the stirring emotion that brings with it a real, and lasting sense of joy and contentment. The best one word description of this classic of cinema is ""beautiful"".Just thinking about this wonderful movie brings a sigh of joy and a lasting feeling of contentment. If you have not seen this excellent work of cinema, then you have not yet arrived.",1011398400,,1386,4.852320675105485
3420740,5,B0018RWMNM,"Robert Duvall has said ""The English have their King Lear and Hamlet. Me?  I'd rather play Gus McCrae any day!""
I agree with Mr. Duvall 100 percent.  Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae are classic American roles, and classic American characters.  As complex and well-written as anything I can think of.  And it was our great fortune that two of our best American actors, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall, were cast to play these two characters.  They are simply indelible.
Woodrow Call, a small man whose ramrod straight bearing and will of iron and ferocious temper makes everyone THINK he is a big man. Stubborn, terse, subtley ironic, a natural leader, with a fierce guard on his emotions. Gus McCrae, lazy, laconic, romantic, with a constant twinkle in his eye and a joke on his lips,  tough & tender with his heart on his sleeve.  These two are the kind of opposites that make truly great and lasting friendships.
These two old retired Texas Rangers decide to take a herd of cattle to the wild and unknown Montana country just for the-hell-of-it, and in this journey much adventure, tragedy and surprises occur that allow us to get to know these two men and their fellow travelers in ways unexpected and profound.
A wonderful story, brought to the screen with love & care, resulting in an unforgettable experience. Full of McMurtry's great touches:  murderous & pitiless villains, fierce and merciless hostile Indians, odd & touching characters, women with depth & guts & heart, and  an impossible trek full of surprises and the sudden death so possible in a hard and wild country.
The entire cast is first-rate, with Diane Lane a Lorena anyone would fall in love with, Frederic Forest a renegade to scare the pants off anyone, young Rick Shroeder as Call's unacknowledged son, Robert Urich as their neer-do-well Ranger friend, Jake, and Danny Glover, Angelica Huston, and the actor who plays Peaeye (sorry for not remembering his name), Chris Cooper and many many more. Cast with loving care.
I dunno, if you don't like Lonesome Dove what's to be done with you? This is a classic American tale, well told, and full of odd & complex characters with great dialogue and plenty of adventure.  Brought to the screen with care & love.  Works for me!
If you like Lonesome Dove, you will probably like the Prequel: Dead Man's Walk, and the Sequel: Streets of Laredo.  May take a bit to adjust to the cast changes, but the roles are cast with care, and the writing is McMurtry's and the stories corkers!

A cattle drive, indians and bandits and the story gives you enough time to know the players and understand their actions and their philosophies.

3420743,4,B0018RWMNM,"I never watched this miniseries on television. It was before I finally saw Silverado on video and realized that Hollywood could still make an epic western and have fun with it, and before Dances With Wolves, long before Unforgiven. What makes those movies work? Character, humor, tragedy, action. All of the pieces are here, with the exception of the sense of hugeness that the book provides does not fit well in to the confines of the TV screen. It is shot a bit tight for my taste. But it is deservedly referred to as an epic and a landmark television event.

Duvall and Jones are in top form and Gus and Call. The cast as a whole works better than any other literary adaptation that I can recall. Robert Urich makes Jake much more despicable than I originally thought would've been possible. Huston, Lane, Rick Schroder, Danny Glover as Deets, all deliver.

So I gave it to him, and when he'd watched it again, I borrowed it.  And even though it's not my style, I really enjoyed it.  It has a wonderful pace, for one thing.  For the first little while I thought I was bored, but then I looked at the clock and I'd been watching for much longer than I would have guessed.
I suppose you could call it a lot of kinds of story -- it's a story of friendship, it's got your basic cowboys and indians stuff going, it's just got some of every kind of western movie plot I can think of -- but for me one of the central things is that it's about all the different ways people can be good.  All the characters aren't good; in fact there are some pretty awful ones, but there's a lot of goodness in a lot of the people in this movie.  It just comes out in different ways in each of them.  That's a pretty powerful point to make.",1002931200,,1032,4.099502487562189

After having read the book and loving it as much as I did, I was not ready to LIKE the miniseries.
I was so incredibly wrong it's not even funny.
From the opening scenes of Lonesome Dove, you KNOW that the actors portraying McMurtry's characters are perfectly cast in their roles.  In fact, they were so well done that I now have difficulty picturing Gus as having any other face than Robert Duvall.  Tommy Lee Jones portrays the perfect Woodrow in this 4 part miniseries, and the other supporting roles are jam packed with incredible acting ability as well.  Danny Glover, Ricky Schroeder, and Angelica Houston are just a few of the theatrical talents who make this miniseries wonderful.
The story itself follows 2 retired Marshalls on a cattle drive from the sleepy town of Lonesome Dove up through Montana.  Their story is tragic in some places, funny in others, and there's a little bit of something for everybody in this movie.
I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone - I've seen it maybe 7 times before, and I will watch it probably 700 more.  It's art, pure and simple. Buy it - you won't regret it.",1002240000,,1324,4.565400843881856

The writing, the high production values and of course, the superb acting by a cast more often associated with blockbusting feature films than T.V. This is such a respected cast here - you have the amazing ROBERT DUVALL (Deep Impact, The Apostle, Tender Mercies) as Gus McCrae, you have the wonderful DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd, Murder at 1600) as the vulnerable Lorena 'Lorie Darlin' Wood. And not forgetting the awesome TOMMY LEE JONES (The Fugitive, Double Jeopardy, Under Siege) as Woodrow Call. These GREAT ACTORS add amazing dimensionality to their characters and the charisma and human depth is something that gives LONESOME DOVE the edge over EVERY other T.V. production I have ever seen! A masterpiece in every sense. The DVD is good but not great. The picture and sound could have been better but are by no means bad. The picture is a little soft in places and the sound lacks real impact, although the score is great. However, it is the best presentation I have ever seen of this particular film.

One of my favorite parts of the series is the pigs; you gotta like those pigs for following everyone all the way up to Montana.

While the story, plot, drama and light-hearted moments in the film are obviously the big draw, it is important to note that many of the central characters are almagamations of actual people who lived in Texas during the time this story takes place.  There really were renegades here who were every bit as vicious as Blue Duck (or ""Mr. Duck"" as Gus calls him at one point).  Gus and Call are familiar to me because the men I was raised around were exactly like them.

Gus McCrae, played by Robert Duvall, is one of the best-written roles I've ever seen on film.  Hats off to Duvall for playing the part so brilliantly.  But that's just one of many memorable characters in this western saga that skillfully weaves several storylines into an exciting adventure with a human touch.  Don't let ""Made for TV"" scare you from this one.  It may be a bit unfair to compare a miniseries with shorter feature films in this genre, but I'd rank this among the greatest westerns ever made.",991872000,,635,4.736363636363636
3420751,5,B0018RWMNM,"In simple terms, 'Lonesome Dove' at once pays homage to, and transcends its genre. Many western 'cliches' are touched upon, but never treated conventionally. Most important among them, the notion of the character who will ""never die"", because he is the hero, or because he or she is ""too sympathetic"". In Larry McMurtry's 'Lonesome Dove', violence, death, and the cruellest motions of 'fate' can come to any character. For this reason alone, 'Lonesome Dove' resembles few others in the genre: it conveys a believable sense of life at the time and in the place of its setting.
The people who inhabit this tale are as real and unforgettable as any in great film or literature. Partly the result of high-caliber acting performances, these characters also benefit from the epic length of the film, which allows them to grow convincingly. This is above all a tale of human connections. Central to it is the long, deep friendship of Gus and the Captain. These two contrasting men have built around them what is essentially an extended family, but one made up of friends and associates whose connections are as strong as blood. One of the most distinctive and moving features of the film is its emphasis on men and their emotions. The Captain with his reigned-in feelings, Gus with his widely encompassing love, and the unequivocal, overwhelming love between these two friends are the solid ground upon which the story is told.
Seldom mentioned is the photographic beauty of the film. This is no studio-bound effort that could be taking place anywhere. An effort has been made by cinematographer Douglas Milsome to establish a potent feel for place. Scene after scene has the epic feel of people set against the gigantic, brutal, astonishing beauty of the natural environment.
The score by Poledouris is among the finest ever. (This most underrated of all western genre elements is partly responsible for the success of such classics as 'Red River', 'The Searchers' and numerous others.) While a conventional, melody-based work, the 'Lonesome Dove' score stands out for the inspiration of its themes and for the deft use that is made of the music. One example: the great scene of Gus leaving Clare's ranch for what will be the last time is underscored by the films main (title) theme--a beautiful tune of simple, mostly stepwise motion--that expresses perfectly, without a hint of bathos, the profound sadness at the center of human lives.
Accolades for performances could be given all around, but special mention must be made of Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Rick Schroeder, Danny Glover, Barry Corbin, D.B. Sweeney, Anjelica Huston, and Chris Cooper--as the wonderful July Johnson.

3420752,5,B0018RWMNM,"I usually judge the ""greatness"" of a film (we movie snobs always refer to the cinematic art as ""film"") by two standards: the number of times I can watch it and the emotions it stirs in me  when I see it or read about it. Lonesome Dove satisfies both criteria.  It just may be the greatest western ever made! For me, only Shane comes close.
There have been only two times in my life when I've watched an actor actually become the character he/she plays: George Scott in Patton and Robert Duvall in Loneseme Dove.  The greatness of an actor becomes evident when they make you forget that they are acting. Duvall accomplishes this in his portrayal of Augustus McCrae.  Tommy Lee Jones is almost as good, as is the entire cast in what must be one of the greatest ensemble groups of all time.

This is particularly dissapointing considering the subject matter and casting.  I found the script to be banal and the cast uninspired in their performances.  I consider myself a Duvall fan and was dissappointed in his wooden performace, inconsistent with the ""character"" ( I was continually reminded throughout the film that he was ""acting"").  This holds true for most of the principals in the film.  I can only assume that this was a result of a poor script, directing or both.  This is not a bad movie, just woefully pedestrian.  I felt that some of the best performances in the movie were offered by the lessser known actors, perhaps the director was star struck in his execution. I expected more from this movie.  I could go on and on, citing continuity/logic problems (how do you keep those linens so white on the trail); Po (cook) deciding to join the cattle drive with complete strangers in less than two seconds; arrrrggggh the miserable nonsense throw-away lines that offer nothing yet help guide a viewer who may not be paying attention or relieve an actor of having to act or the director from having to direct.  Certainly this is not the best mini-series made!  I did however enjoy watching some of my favorite actors honing thier skills or was it paying their dues?",979171200,,1430,4.725806451612903
3420758,5,B0018RWMNM,"I was indifferent when my mother first suggested watching a videotaped miniseries a friend had loaned her. All I knew of Larry McMurtry was that he'd written ""Terms of Endearment,"" and that didn't exactly entice me. Besides, I hadn't seen a good Western in years (this was before Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven,"" of course) and thought of them as a played-out genre, only watched by old men who had no interest in contemporary fiction.
How wrong I was. ""Lonesome Dove"" is an astonishing miniseries about heroism, friendship, dreams, men, women and everything in between. This extraordinary series drove me to the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which I've read repeatedly (no mean feat, since it's a hefty book). The characters are as real to me as any I've ever encountered in fiction, and even now, years after first meeting them on that tape, they can make me laugh and bring me to tears, every time.
Because even though McMurtry and the miniseries do a good job of conveying the amazing sweep of the West, and the action is shocking and brutal, it's the characters that make this work. Robert Duvall has said that Augustus McCrae is his favorite role of all time, and it's easy to see why: Gus and Call embody the two extremes of fictional heroes -- the rogue and the straight arrow -- but McMurtry, Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones bring them to life as fully fleshed-out men, with internal contradictions, fatal flaws while still being extremely admirable and charismatic heroes.
Many people have praised McMurtry's women, and I'll echo that sentiment. Diane Lane and Angelica Houston in particular shine in their roles, which may not be starring ones, but are substantial and meaty, loving without being unrealistic. Their characters are plot engines but, as with Call and Gus, they're fully realized people.
""Lonesome Dove"" stands the test of time as one of the greatest TV miniseries ever and, more importantly, a wonderful American saga. Buy this DVD and watch it again and again, then dive into McMurtry's four ""Lonesome Dove"" novels.",977270400,,2035,4.953216374269005

I am amazed how I am drawned into the story and how even though I have seen it at least 15 times since the first viewing I see it as fresh as the first time. Last night as I was watching the final part I had forgotten what it was that caused Gus to go away from the herd and I found myself trying to will that he would remain with them.

But Lonesome Dove is winner and still champ, and the main reason for it is Robert Duvall's performance as Gus McCrae, surely one of the greatest performances ever recorded for posterity. The rest of the supporting cast--Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston, even Robert Urich--is a hand-and-glove match for Duvall, and all of the actors more than do justice to the superb screenplay. I love the characters--and the actors who played them--so much that I find myself taking almost a familial interest in them; when I read of Diane Lane's success in ""The Perfect Storm,"" or Rick Schroder's in ""NYPD Blue,"" I feel happy that Lorie and Newt are making their way in the world!",974592000,,1011,5.170731707317073

Point blank... the best western ever!  Oh... you aren't a big fan of westerns?  Well that's okay.  Lonesome Dove holds it's own against any  drama, action adventure or comedy.  It's everything wrapped into one.  The  only negative thing about this movie happens to be the very thing that  makes it so good... it's 6 hour length.  That is why the DVD version is a  must.  You don't have to mess around with 3 or 4 video tapes.  This is one  of the few ""westerns"" that the ladies truly enjoy. Lonesome Dove  is not all gunfights and saloon brawls, but it's not at all boring either.  It is filled with witty dialogue and humor.  It's perfect for lazy rainy  days.

Interesting  interview clips with McMurtry, although the question-and-answer format is a  stupid idea -- a straight-through interview with him would have been much  more enjoyable (warts and all; it has obviously been edited-down from a  longer, probably rambling discussion of the book, etc.).  His discussions  about evolution of the story, the parallels to Don Quixote, and where the  title ""Lonesome Dove"" came from and what it really means are the  best parts of the interview (and I'm now really irritated that for all  these years I never realized what it meant).",957052800,,775,5.12
3420773,5,B0018RWMNM,"Playing the Texas Ranger turned cattleman, Gus McRae, this is unquestionably Robert Duval's greatest acting achievement. Had this adaptation of Larry McMurtry's award-winning novel been made for the Big  Screen rather than television, it would have garnered very major Academy  Award for that year. It's also every bit as good as the book, if not  better.
In my opinion, this is the finest vision of the mythical American  West ever put on film. It has everything: flawed good guys, horrific bad  guys, Indian fights, shootouts, the hooker with a Heart of Gold, rustlers,  a danger-filled cattle drive, hangings, lost loves, loyalty of friendship,  cowardice, bravery, tragedy, drama, humor. The cynic will say that the film  is simply a compilation of clich&eacute;s. However, everything is tied together so  wonderfully by Duval and a magnificent supporting cast, spectacular  cinematography, authentic period costuming, and a soundtrack to knock your  socks off, that it's hard to object even if you realize your emotions are  being shamelessly manipulated.

""Lonesome Dove"" is not just the greatest television production of all time, but  one of the best movies ever filmed. The characters are all extremely well  drawn, the acting is nothing less than superb, and the script is absolutely  brilliant. This magnificent picture stays true to the romantic vision of  the American West while not shying away from the dark aspects of its  history. Because of this, the story has the sprawling look of an epic saga,  yet is on many levels an intimate story of friendship.
I love  practically everything about this movie, and only wish there were more like  it. This film definitely ranks with ""The Searchers,"" ""My  Darling Clementine,"" and ""The Unforgiven"" as one of the  greatest and most intelligent westerns of all time.",954374400,,880,4.69281045751634

3420778,5,B0018RWMNM,"This is the most powerful movie I've ever seen, period.  To call it a ""western"" is to mistakenly place it in a category with a bunch of mediocre action films with cowboys and Indians.  I don't like westerns.  The fact that it is set in the old west and there are cattle and cowboys  and Indians is really just incidental...the movie is really a romantic  tragedy, every bit as powerful and tragic as Romeo and Juliet.  This is a  story about a man who travels across the country to be with the love of his  life, only to find out (mistakenly) that they can never be together.  Robert Duvall and Ajelica Huston are just masterful in this movie...the  scene in Clair's house where Clair lets out a nervous, hysterical laugh is  the most powerful scene I've ever seen in any movie...the chemistry between  them is so real that it's hard to believe it's just a movie.  The  characters have integrity...honor, pride, justice, love, respect, and  compassion.  The values and ethics are measured throughout the  movie....friendship vs. justice, love vs. independence, etc..  But more  importantly, the characters have weaknesses that they never overcome.  Gus  never overcomes his pride or his laziness, Woodrow never comes to terms  with his own weaknesses.  You get the sense that these are real people, not  some made-up Hollywood characters that change because the movie is about to  end.  The plot of the movie has integrity too... there are no cliches, and  no gratuitous feel-good happy endings.  The movie ends with a lonely old  man denying his weaknesses, trying to find some perspective about his life.  This is one of those rare movies that actually gets better the second time  you watch it, because the second time you realize how tragic the  characters' decisions are.  I've watched it about 20 times over the years,  and it has made me cry every single time.",952732800,,1867,4.80379746835443

Could there be any more memorable  performances than Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow Call and Robert Duvall as  Augustus McCrae? The strength of the characters combined with the skills of  these actors, provides a marvelous experience for us. We are indeed humbled  in their presence.
With each tale of this epic, we meet wonderful new and  diverse characters, delivered by such outstanding performers as Diane Lane,  Danny Glover, Frederick Forrest, Chris Cooper. Even the on again, off again  types, the Barry Corbins, the Glynne Headleys, the Robert Uhrichs, the  Anjelica Hustons, all shine in their roles.
Robert Duvall many times has  commented on how lucky he was to be blessed with the opportunity to play  Gus, indeed it is us who are the lucky ones.

3420785,4,B0018RWMNM,"This film is one of my favorite westerns and I have seen it a number of times, both on broadcast TV and on VHS tape.  In my opinion the DVD version was better than both. It appeared to me that there were a few small scenes  that I had never noticed before in previous viewings.
Although the audio  is only Dolby 2-channel it still sounds very good.  IMDb doesn't have any  technical specs on this movie, but it does indicate that the sound mix is  mono, so I guess we can't expect the DVD sound to be more than what was  origianlly recorded.
IMDb also indicates the movie is 384 minutes long.  The DVD indicates that it is the entire 6-hours.  I haven't timed it, but  it appears to be at least 6-hours.  It comes on a single 2-sided DVD disc.  The only format available is fullscreen (1.33:1), no widescreen.  The movie  was shot on film, but was originally produced for broadcast TV.  This is  probably why it's only available as fullscreen, but it sure would have been  much nicer as widescreen.  Imagine some of the sweeping cinematography in a  widescreen version!
Not sure why some other folks thought this DVD  transfer wasn't all too good, perhaps it is their equipment or the DVD  itself was damaged.  I did not see or hear any problems on my equipment. I  viewed it on a Panasonic DVD-A120 using colorstream output into a 61-inch  Toshiba Cinema Series HDTV Ready Digital Progressive Scan TV (TX61X81) with  a Dolby Surround Audio system and it looked and sounded very good.

One thing to note - the movie  breaks at the same break points that the mini-series did when broadcast.  After approximately 1.5 hours, the credits roll, and then the next section  starts.  Not that bad, but a little clunky.  The interview snippets with  Larry McMurtry are kind of insightful and nice to have.
Robert Duvall is  really incredible in the role of Augustus (Gus) McCrae.  The man is the  character. I found I was laughing to myself all over again at Gus's western  philosopher dialogue, and wishing that we all thought a little more like  him.
If you loved the VHS version and want a better copy, buy this DVD.  Though not crystal clear, it is an improvement over my old VHS copy and  with instant chapter access, much more convenient to view.",951004800,,1018,4.48087431693989

About the only problem I noticed was an occasional  audio skip (I counted 2 or 3, I think), nothing however that would prevent  me from purchasing this movie on DVD again.  Any time you have a six hour  story to watch, DVD is the only way to go.
The movie is separated in  sections just as it was when shown on TV, with both beginning and ending  credits for each section.  Within each section you have the choice of going  directly to various scenes, so gone are the days of tedious VHS  rewind/fastforward searches.  Anyone who loves this movie should be well  served by the DVD version, provided of course your not expecting  ""superior"" DVD transfer quality (The DVD image seemed as good as  what I viewed on TV when the series aired years ago).

They were men of my grandfather's and his father's time. Men who held their honor and courage in the most sacred place. Lonesome Dove illuminates brilliantly these character traits and the script certainly follows McMurtry's vision. It is Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall though that help us see these authentic characters function in the real, basic, and heart-stopping beauty of the West.

This story is much more than a western. If you hate westerns, you will still like this. The movie starts slow, but you appreciate that after the story unfolds. The main story is about two lifelong friends. Bored with their lives in Texas, and both needing something more, they recruit cowboys and gather a herd of cattle to drive to Montana.

While driving the herd to Montana is the main story, Lonesome Dove containsmany interesting sub stories that tie together throughout the movie. The story is so much more than a cattle drive. It is a story of loyalty and two best friends. It's a story about a deep love between old lovers, heartbreak, loss, tragedy, happiness and becoming an adulthood. Characters must confront external enemies and enemies within themselves. 

The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall is genuine, but it overshadows the amazing casting. They did an incredible job casting and pairing minor and major characters. There is not a bad actor! The set and detail looks authentic. 
To this day, Lonesome Dove is still my favorite move.
