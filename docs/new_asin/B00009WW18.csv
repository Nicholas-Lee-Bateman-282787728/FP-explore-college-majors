1895162,5,B00009WW18,"""Mr and Mrs Iyer"" is set against the backdrop of communal riots in India. The story unfolds with a Tamil Brahmin woman, Meenakshi Iyer [Konkona Sensharma] who is on a bus trip together with her 5-month-old son Santhanam. Also on board this bus is Raja Chaudhary [Rahul Bose]a Muslim wildlife photographer and other passengers ranging from a raucous group of youth, an old Muslim couple and a pair of Sikhs. Prior to the trip,Raja had agreed, at the behest of Meenakshi's parents to assist their daughter and grandson on the trip. However, what was supposed to be a routine bus trip turns out to be anything but when the bus is brought to an abrupt halt with the imposition of curfew due to the outbreak of communal riots [a Hindu village had been burned down and rampaging Hindu mobs are going after Muslims].

Meenakshi who had been unaware of Raja being a Muslim, is shocked when he tells her of his religious affiliation. In fact she is mortified as she had accepted water from him [being a conservative Brahmin, this act of accepting water from a person of another faith is prohibited]. However, when a rioting mob of Hindus board the bus, Meenakshi casts aside her own prejudices and protects Raja's Muslim identity by giving the impression that they are a married couple, i.e. ""Mr and Mrs Iyer"". There are some disturbing scenes of violence and implied violence, but what is even more astounding is the fact that most people seem to go about their lives after such brutalities - perhaps this is an indictment against society's apparent apathy in the face of intolerance.

In the course of making their way back to safety, the pair come to understand each other better in terms of their respective faiths and beliefs. There are strong undercurrents of attraction between the two, and in fact, this movie seems as much of a 'love story' as it is a portrayal of the effects of racial intolerance.

The strong performances by the leads elevate this movie beyond just another melodrama. Konkona Sensharma is credible in her portrayal of a Tamil Brahmin woman and being familiar with the language myself, I was awed at her mastery of the nuances of the language [since she is not a Tamil Brahmin]. Rahul Bose is a fine actor, and conveys his emotions with his expressive eyes and facial expressions without even having to resort to dialogue.

Bollywood is known more for fluff-type movies than those with substance, and with ""Mr and Mrs Iyer"", director Aparna Sen has given us a gem of cinematic subtlety underscored by finely-nuanced performances.",1239753600,2,2548,4.7972665148063784
1895163,5,B00009WW18,"The previous reviews, together, give you a pretty good idea of how interesting, thought-provoking, and entertaining this movie is.  I would like to add some information for those of you who are Americans but not Desis or immigrants from South Asia.  India is not a monolithic society made up of only one language, one dominant culture, one relgion, but rather quite a complex multicultural, diverse mix of languages, religions, cultures, subcultures, and this affects their movie industry.  This movie only seems atypical if all you know of Indian movies are the so called ""Bollywood"" Hindi movies, most akin to American Broadway musicals.  In the South of India, the Tamil language movie industry often covers more serious topics and themes, with dramatic movies that are meant to be thoughtful and pensive.  Also, though, the Tamil movies include another genre of action, macho-hero films that don't really translate well, but can be unintentionally funny.",1212364800,4,958,5.276315789473684
1895164,5,B00009WW18,"I just saw Mr and Mrs Iyer. I am a South Indian Tamil Brahmin living in the US for the past 50 years and the opening scene is extremely typical of an academically oriented but culturally close Tamil Brahmins. I have never heard of Konkan Sen Sharma and originally I thought Meenakshi was a Tamil Brahmin actress. I was really surprised to learn that Sen Sharma mastered this Tamil dialect and rendered the dialog with a perfect Tamil Brahmin Accent. She spoke English also with a Tamil Brahmin accent.  Apart from that the film itself is beautifully interwoven with nuances, facial expressions and body language which I thought were extraordinary. Facial expressions and body language have much more impact than spoken words. The chemistry between Meenakshi and Raja rises from nothing to its crescendo at the end. In this respect, I have never seen in any film Indian or English such an extraordinarily realistic acting. The closest to this perfection is perhaps Ingrid Bergman. Rahul Bose gives a very self contained performance with unspoken words and serves as an excellent counterpoint to Sensharma. The story inevitably comes to the only conclusion it can come with Meenakshi with her baby Santhanam in her arms staring with wistful eyes filled with tears at the vast sea of blurred humanity in which Raja has disappeared. It reminded me of the ending of Casablanca where Rick stares at the aircraft wistfully with Ilsa and her husband Victor vanishing in the vast cloud cover.",1195776000,10,1483,4.955823293172691
1895165,5,B00009WW18,"Not all movies from India are Bollywood films. Aparna Sen, the director of Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, is a student of the great Satyajit Ray, India's premier director of award-winning films that came out of Calcutta, not Mumbai (Bombay). Ms. Sen has done a magnificent job in Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, which actually has Mrs. Iyer from southern India.

This film has a message, shows humanity's foibles (and worse), but leaves us uplifted, because she shows the deepening relationship of the two main characters and how they become better through their experience together. In spite of a few flaws in this film, it is absorbing to watch the story unfold and I enthusiastically give this film 5 stars! I've watched it several times and still love it!",1173657600,10,734,4.7795275590551185
1895166,5,B00009WW18,"How surprising there are so few reviews of this film on Amazon.  The movie Mr. & Mrs. Iyer is about a Muslim man & a Hindu woman & her child who are thrown together during a bus ride to Calcutta, India that is halted by local religious riots.
As a man & a woman & her infant prepare to board a bus their friends & family seeing them off introduce the man & woman to each other.  The man thanks the woman's father for helping him to obtain a pass into a forest where he will be taking wildlife photographs.  In return, the family, who thinks he is Hindu because his nickname is Raja, asks him to watch over their daughter, Meenakshi, & her infant as they travel alone to meet her husband.  As Meenakshi struggles with her infant on the bus Raja helps her & ends up sitting next to her & eventually discloses he is Muslim.  She is repelled, but when Hindu militants board the bus & interrogate the passengers to identify the Muslim men, Mrs. Iyer claims the man next to her is her husband, Mr. Iyer, in order to save his life.
The development of the Raja & Meenakshi's reliance on each other &, eventually, their friendship is subtle, intelligent, & compelling.  The storyline is assisted by great scenery & a nice soundtrack with no musical numbers.  I expected the storyline to be more political & violent, but it centers on how a few people's opinions & prejudices can change.  This is the one of the best films I have seen come out of Indian cinema & I look forward to seeing more movies like Mr. & Mrs. Iyer come out of India.
If you like this movie, you may also enjoy the films Earth & Water directed by Deepa Mehta & Hey Ram directed by Kamal Hassan.",1169856000,10,1656,4.285256410256411
1895167,5,B00009WW18,"The silence used throughout this film conveys layers of moods that grip the viewer, putting you in the bus on that bumpy road. Silence conveys the peacefulness of the breathtaking surroundings, the eeriness of a closed road, the innocent sleep of passengers unaware of an approaching disaster, the growing romance between 2 passengers whose religions have clashed for centuries.

I was riveted by this movie and the quiet, understated character portrayals by the actors. Characters so real, so familiar to me as a traveler in India, that the actors hardly seemed to be acting at all. The understated but devastating violence was heart-wrenching rather than gory. The message was moral but very simple and quiet, not forcing the point. So simple that one might overlook this movie thinking it is ""trite"" - ""a person's character defines him more than his caste or religion."" Not watching this movie would be a mistake. It grips your heart from the beginning scenes and turns this simple moral into something new and intensely meaningful in this day and age we live in.",1157500800,16,1066,4.98876404494382
1895168,5,B00009WW18,"Mr and Mrs Iyer is about a Muslim man who is asked to be a travelling companion on a bus journey to an Hindu woman and her child. She didn't know until later on that he was a Muslim.

The USA format DVD is available.

' Filled with singing teenagers, doddering old people, card-playing drunkards, freshly-married love birds and a crying baby, the bus suggests a mini-India. Just when noise and claustrophobia threaten to overwhelm the film, the ship-of-fools scenario is tipped by unforeseen violence: extremist Hindus are on a rampage looking for Muslim blood to avenge the burning of a village. There's a curfew, and the bus can't go on. ""Mr. and Mrs. Iyer"" isn't your regular Bollywood fare--there is humor but no songs, and the seriousness of the subject matter always intrudes. In one of the film's most haunting scenes, Raja finds the dentures of an old man who had been dragged from the bus in a riverbed where others brush their teeth. Violence erupts occasionally but stays on the edges of the picture, with references to hotspots like Northern Ireland and Israel-Palestine to drive its point home. But the menace can't obstruct the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Iyer is, at heart, a love story. The backdrop of strife and unrest allows the guarded affection between Raja and Meenakshi to grow. (The raffish good looks of leading man Rahul Bose, the traditional beauty of Konokon Sensharma, and the lush exotic countryside also don't hurt.) As their journey progresses, the two grow closer and closer, but nothing can change the fact that Mrs. Iyer's real husband is waiting for her at the end of the line.'",1131321600,4,1609,4.784172661870503
7993872,5,B00009WW18,"A complex story of racial, religious, and caste differences between a couple forced together by circumstances on a bus ride across India that meets with terrorism on the small, localized scale along the way.

The lead actors did amazing jobs, the material and dialogue are very compelling, and I re-watched the whole movie immediately to catch more nuances the second time around: I was so rapt the first viewing, I'm sure I missed half of the sub-context.

There is very, very brief nudity and language that is largely relevant to the story line.",1415750400,,547,4.870967741935484
7993873,5,B00009WW18,This is a touching and wonderful Indian movie that also provides historical insights into India.  It is the movie that my Indian friends recommended when I said I wanted to see a Bollywood movie and they groaned.  They were right.,1386115200,,230,4.725
7993874,5,B00009WW18,"I really love this Indian-made movie.  We have been to India many times so for me it has special appeal just because it takes place in India.  It is definitely an Indian movie and the people are just normal everyday Indian people doing every day normal things.  A Muslim man and a Hindu woman with a baby are traveling together on a long distance bus.  They strike up a casual acquaintance.  However then there is a Hindu uprising and the bus is invaded by radical Hindus who have burned villages and now are seeking Muslims to kill.  Our Hindu woman says the Muslim man is her husband and consequently he is not disturbed.  But the area is so unsafe that a curfew is called and the bus goes no further and the man, woman and child are stranded and finally find a place to stay together in the country.  And then begins a story that touches on prejudice, goodness and breaking down walls of division.  It is a beautiful touching movie that is high up on my favorite list.  I am moved every time that I watch it.  A wonderful movie.",1384473600,,1031,4.345549738219895
7993875,5,B00009WW18,"Love the movie!

But even though they said the DVD was new, they sent a used one since the surface was all scratched up. I am still going to keep it since I did not have issues playing it.",1355875200,,188,3.8205128205128207
7993876,3,B00009WW18,"This film has a powerful message, but some of it definitely was lost in non-translation. Conversations between native speakers need subtitles so the whole story can be understood by English-speaking audiences. Otherwise, it was a richly textured story in a strikingly beautiful country wracked by turmoil and violence. Still, it was not as emotionally engaging as I expected.",1332115200,,375,5.482758620689655
7993877,4,B00009WW18,This is a film about people foremost and also the sad religious politics around them.  The acting is very low key and perfect for the story.  Humanity abounds in tense situations.  I like the use of the bus to tie disparate people together in surprising ways.,1324598400,,259,4.586956521739131
7993878,5,B00009WW18,Great movie!  Love the storyline and to watch the change of prejudices someone has toward another when they open their heart and see others for who they really are and not what others make them out to be.  Need to watch to understand what I meant.  Great story!,1278892800,,261,4.395833333333333
7993879,5,B00009WW18,"This is a review of this movie (and not this particular DVD).

Mr. and Mrs. Iyer is very good movie. I'm not even trying to use any adjectives here because they can not explain how good this movie is - watching it is your only way of finding out. The story is so simple yet believable. The romance in this movie is morally wrong yet desired. It's about 2 characters who endure a tough time together and by the end of it, have come close. It was natural for them to come close but it was also morally wrong as the female is married already. Every time I watch this movie, I end up having a debate with my wife. The ending of this movie still makes me sad.

This is made by Aparna Sen who is not your regular Bollywood director. The female actor in this movie is Konkona (Aparna's daughter). Everything about this movie is just perfect... script, dialogues, acting, camera work, background score etc. If you are looking for some good foreign language films to watch... this must be your pick from India. The version I watched had English subtitles in it. Five stars all the way!",1270598400,4,1076,4.375
7993880,5,B00009WW18,"Though fictional, It somehow depicts troubled times of the India Pakistan independence. Feelings ran high and atrocities were committed on both sides. The British who milked, plundered and looted India for centuries walked away from the mess literally unscaled. The movie depicts a lighter side to those otherwise troubling times. Highly recomended.",1258156800,,349,5.730769230769231
7993881,5,B00009WW18,"Early in my Hindi film watching experience, my husband turned me onto Mr. and Mrs. Iyer.

Though this film is quite subdued, that style of delivery actually heightens the terrifying tension that comes about as the implications of Hindu-Muslim tensions are explored.

A quiet, run-of-the-mill bus ride turns into a day of terror when it's caught in the middle of an inter-religious flashpoint.

If you've ever heard of these long standing tensions, then this movie will ring true as a authentic insight.

If not, this is still worth a serious watch.  A very good film.",1242518400,2,567,4.926315789473684
