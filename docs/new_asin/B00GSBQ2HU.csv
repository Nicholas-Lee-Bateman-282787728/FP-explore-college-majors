6107115,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" (2013 release from South Africa; 139 min.) is the movie interpretation of Nelson Manela's 1995 autobiography of the same name. An introductory voice-over from Mandela (played by Idris Elba) stating the ""my father had given me the name troublemaker"" is never explained nor explored. and instead we are almost immediately thrown into Mandela's private law practice as a 24 yr. old in Johannesburg in 1942. So much for understanding Mandela's background or upbringing. The movie provides a parallel chronicle of Mandela's family life and political rise. Even though controversial for much of his life (up until becoming the beloved elder statesman in the early 90s), there is only one hint in the entire movie of Mandela as less than a saint (when we seen him cheating on his first wife and then beating her when denying the affair). The movie dutifully documents the 27 year prison term, and Mandela's subsequent release in 1990 and becoming South Africa's President in 1994.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, given the immense popularity of Nelson Mandela and his incredible life story, I was surprised how little emotional pull this movie has, despite its noble intentions. It simply came across as a by-the-numbers biopic without much cohesion or vision. The only time I felt emotionally connected/involved in the movie was when Mandela, then in prison on Robben Island, gets a visit from his now 16 yr. old daughter, whom he last saw when she was 5. Second, I couldn't help but be struck by the fact that every single white person (man and women) in the entire movie up until near the very end is portrayed as an abusive fascist pig, and I do mean EVERY SINGLE ONE. Third, let's give proper credit to the acting performance of British actor Idris Elba, portraying Mandela over a timespan of 5 decades. It is near impossible to portray such an iconic figure with credibility but Elba somehow manages. Fourth, without being disrespectful, I can only imagine the imaginary high-fives that took place at The Weinstein Company, given the timing of Mandela's passing away, literally within a week of the movie's official release, thereby significantly increasing the attention to this movie. Harvey Weinstein couldn't have scripted it or timed it better himself. Lastly, there is a bunch of great African music throughout the movie, as well as more 'traditional' songs like Bob Marley's cover of ""War"" and U2's new song, ""Ordinary Love"", which over the movie's closing credits (the soundtrack is available here on Amazon for anyone interested).

The movie came out 2 weeks ago here in Cincinnati but due to the holidays I only had a chance to go see it this weekend. The late matinee screening where I saw this at was not particularly well attended, and given the less that robust word of mouth this movie has generated, and the apparent lack of Oscar potential but for Elba's performance, I don't see this movie becoming the box office hit that one might've expected from a movie like this. Bottom line: ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" is noble and well intended, but regretfully falls short of expectations and feels like ""just another"" by-the-numbers biopic that fails to surprise or captivate.",1388793600,4,3232,4.983333333333333
6107116,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"This scattershot bio-pic covers everything from Mandela's early childhood as a Xhosa born to the royal Thembu family in apartheid South Africa, through his revolutionary role with the African National Congress (ANC), his time in prison, and up to his election as President of a multi- racial South Africa. For some reason it seems to skip the international honors he was awarded, e.g., The Nobel Peace Prize, but offers a rich story arc of his wife Winnie.

We watch:
  * Idris Elba (""Luther"") as Nelson Mandela, a cunning lawyer, a cautious revolutionary and a crafty prisoner. He was arrested for his ANC activities, for which he was given the death sentence, commuted to life. He served 27 years in two different prisons during which his wife Winnie and the ANC launched an effective, international ""Free Mandela"" campaign, augmented by trade embargoes and other pressures brought to bear on the apartheid government of South Africa.
  * Naomie Harris (""Skyfall"") is Winnie Mandela, his second wife; mother of his two daughters; an intelligent and proactive participant in his life. After being imprisoned, she became a dedicated terrorist who vilified her white oppressors. Her rabid activism became a liability to him later in life.

As a fan of Idris Elba ever since ""The Wire,"" I would be happy to watch him read a telephone book, so even though this gave him plenty to do, I would have appreciated a better script. William Nicholson based his screenplay on Mandela's autobiography, but tried (unwisely) to make this film encompass his entire life. Director Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl"") uses flashbacks and other devices to fill in the blanks.

This movie had the mixed blessing of being released 20 days after Mandela's death at age 95, so there was more than uncommon interest in his life. Amazon already has the DVD ready for pre-order.",1388707200,12,1859,4.996763754045308
6107117,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is elevated above your average biopic by a towering performance from that singular 6'2 charisma machine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Idris-Elba/dp/B00FWLDHSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Idris Elba</a>. Idris Elba is one of the great black actors of our time; he carries the gravity of Denzel, the charisma of a demigod, and the magnetism to make lesser men weep. He's cancelled the apocalypse, saved the world twice, and now turns his talent to the role of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.

The temptation to play Mandela as a larger-than-life figure must have been great, but Elba's performance is human and sympathetic. The weight of the years of pain, injustice, and violence weigh heavy on his shoulders, but there is steel in his voice. Elba perfects the complex African accent, and works through difficult age makeup to bring Mandela's older self to life. In my opinion, this is the finest depiction of Mandela to grace the big screen yet.

But alongside Elba, and a worthy companion to him, is an equally towering Naomie Harris as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Playing alongside Idris Elba is a tall order, but if any actress could do it, it's Naomie Harris. Showing her range from pirates to spies, Harris is one of the most diverse actresses working today. Even when the film takes on a rather predictable structure in the second act, her moving performance is described by critics as ""a crucial injection of warmth and humanity"" and ""a firecracker"".

So now we get to the ""con"" part of the review. Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom does not have many problems, but it does have big ones. While there are portions of the film that successfully bring to life Mandela's character and the events surrounding him, the film's scope is too epic, and often stoops to rote fact-by-fact narration of Mandela's colorful life. It's pace is too quick and grand, covering too much ground, without pausing to savor certain moments or give true insight into character. A more focused screenplay would have saved this film a lot of grief.

CONCLUSION: On the whole, MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is hugely flawed - at times, it covers too much ground without paying attention to character - but also technically striking, and a powerfully acted glimpse into the life of one of history's greatest peacemakers and visionaries...made only more poignant by the great man's death. My rating? 4 long walks out of 5.

P.S. RIP, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. You were a great man, a powerful leader, and an icon of equality, justice, and peace. 1918 - 2013",1388361600,5,2601,5.139479905437352
6107118,5,B00GSBQ2HU,"Wow! What a movie. It's not just a story, it's someone's  life, among us all.  It is amazing how he released all  bitterness, and was able to 'turn poison in to medicine""  he overcame his own pain, and that of a whole nation, and brought healing to all.",1388188800,2,253,4.208333333333333
6107119,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"History will remember the late, great Nelson Mandela as one of the world's most important leaders. His devotion to South Africa and to the freedom of his people is a unparalleled, putting him in the company of immortal human rights icons, like Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Gandi, and Malcolm X. Mandela spent nearly half of his life incarcerated as a unique living martyr  and although he was out of sight, he was never out of mind. Looking back at the life of Mandela, he is an inspiration for all of use, proving that no matter how difficult something becomes, if you give yourself to a cause and demand change, you will reap the rewards. And, also like history's greatest figures, Nelson Mandela will likely see his immortality recognized many times over on the big screen  the first of which is Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.

Director Justin Chadwick (The Other Boleyn Girl, The First Grader) helms this Nelson Mandela biopic, starring Idris Elba as Nelson Mandela. When the film begins, we see shades of Mandela entering adulthood, eventually moving quickly into his days as a lawyer. It doesn't take long for this film to set a disturbing tone of racial inequality in the troubled county of South Africa. Before focusing on his prominent role in fighting apartheid (forced racial segregation), the film turns its attention to his first marriage  which is slowly deteriorates due to his prolonged absence and infidelity.

After his first wife leaves him, Mandela turns his sights to protests and speaking to supporters of the freedom fighter cause. At the same time, he meets Winnie Madikizela (Naomie Harris), whom he quickly falls for, marries, and incorporates in their battle for freedom. With his people behind him, Mandela is now a polarizing figure that's hunted for allegedly being behind a violent revolution with the intent to overthrow the nation. He, and those close to him, are eventually apprehended and given life imprisonment  but if you think that would be enough to deter a revolution, you're wrong. Even behind bars, Nelson Mandela finds ways to inspire his closest friends and a country desperate for change.

Biopics can be a bear to tackle, especially when they're based squally on the majority of one man's life. Nelson Mandela accomplished more in his life than you could ever hope to put into a roughly 2 hour film. With that being said, Long Walk to Freedom, based on the autobiography of the same name written by Nelson Mandela, chronicles the most important aspects of his life  at lest the important moments regarding peace for South Africa. And, if you even vaguely recall the history of South Africa, then you know it's a dark, desperate time. Keeping with that idea, this film does nothing to shy away from the endless amount of violence that took place. One moment in particular is highlighted  that being the disturbing and pivotal moment in 1960 when South African police officers opened fire on unarmed protesters.

There are several crucial, moving events that take place over the course of this film  but as you might expect, many of them have a tendency to feel rushed. Everything moves at a relatively quick pace, but the one thing that makes it such a joy to witness is the acting work of Idris Elba. It's hard to imagine the pressures of taking on such a monumental figure, but Elba does so with such awe-inspiring grace. No, there's nothing about Elba that resembles Nelson Mandela, but Elba's attempt to reenact his voice is both noteworthy and impressive. Elba's portrayal is not only appealing and engaging, but one would like to think that even Nelson Mandela would have been proud of this performance.

This film is one dominated by mostly two figures, one of which is Nelson Mandela and the other being his wife, Winnie  played splendidly by Naomie Harris. While Mandela is a peaceful man that resists the urge to turn to violence, his wife appears to be far more vengeful. You could easily call this couple, who spend far more time apart than together, two different sides of the same coin. One is patient and picks his spots to act, while the other is full of rage and actively involved in the belief to fight  not just figuratively, but physically. Harris adds anger to a film that is surprisingly calm, all be it melancholy and hopelessly resilient.

Overall, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is your average biopic that bites off quite a bit of information and tries to incorporate it in a restricted amount of time. However, while it does seem chopping and off-key at times, it doesn't hinder the quality of the film. There's no shortage of drama to be found in Mandela's life story, but much of it  like his children, marriage, and worldwide diplomacy as the eventual President of South Africa, are overlooked to tell a more concise story about the country's struggles for freedom. Idris Elba and Naomie Harris both give quality performances, which greatly improve this film, and if nothing else, Long Walk to Freedom tells a tremendous story that will serve as a satisfactory vehicle for information about one of the greatest leaders in modern history. This film should be viewed by any and all that have an interest in world history or the beloved Nelson Mandela.

6107120,5,B00GSBQ2HU,"I had been waiting months to see this and finally got to see a prescreening for it.  It follows Mandela's life -childhood thru political career.  Really good storyline.  Touches on infidelity, prison time, behind the movements, etc.  Acting was really good Idris and Naomie did a great job.  Thick accents but easy to understand.",1387670400,2,329,5.018518518518518
6107121,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"The film covers from the time Mandela (Idris Elba) was a child entering manhood to his election. It touches on problems in his personal life, including infidelity. It touches on tire necklaces. It ignores much of the pressure brought on by the international community.

I liked the acting. At 2 1/2 hours, the film weighs on you as you watch it. Mandela in prison struggling to get long pants while international boycotts go unmentioned. Granted this was not a documentary about the movement, but a bio of Mandela. Still I felt his significance on the world front was diminished. From a human point of view, I liked the film ""Winnie Mandela"" with Jennifer Hudson better than this one.

The theme, You alone are small, your people are mighty, was mentioned a couple of times, but the film didn't make any great lengths to demonstrate it. A better theme would have been one of forgiveness, something mentioned in the film. Mandela's involvement in the 1995 Rugby World Cup I think would have made a better ending, driving home the point of unity and forgiveness.

Parental Guide: No sex, people undressing as if to have sex. No nudity, prison men in underwear. Maybe an F-bomb of two, hard to tell with accents. 3 1/2 stars",1387584000,20,1221,4.723004694835681

6107127,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"This is a nice film that seems to accomplish what it sets out to do, but there are a few flaws. Perhaps it tries to do too much in too little time--the first half of the film feels very fragmented and disjointed.  There's very little flow to it, and it sometimes takes a few moments to allow the brain to catch up with sudden shifts in the narrative. I would also agree with other reviewers who are disappointed with what has been left out--there seems to be a fear here of running too long, something that we learned with ""Gandhi"" isn't a huge problem if you have a truly compelling narrative.  And the life of Mandela does provide that. They could easily have given us more details without spoiling the film.  That said, it's still a worthwhile film to see.",1490486400,,759,4.4071428571428575

However, there are actually moments in the film you completely overlook the obvious and begin paying attention to the nuances of the actor's portrayal.  When you get right down to it, Elba was VERY FAR from being the wrong choice.

Elba's Mandela was believable.  The mannerisms, the vocal intonations, etc. make the character.  Here's a case that proves looks aren't everything.",1416268800,2,446,5.054794520547945

6107238,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"No question after the black civil rights struggle here in America, headed at various points by Doctor Martin Luther King, subsided with some partial victories around voting and freeing work opportunities the axis of the international black liberation struggle shifted, shifted in American eyes, to the horrible conditions of blacks in South Africa. There under the conscious apartheid policy complete with the hated pass system of the Afrikaner government blacks were held as little more than chattel. And were expected to like it to boot. Something about the white mans civilizing mission although more likely, much more likely his craving for cheap labor to work those money-filled, resource-filled mines that drove the South African economy. The situation called for black resistance, called big time for black resistance, since the white government was not interested in the least in sharing power, any power, except maybe that given to their black front men to control the masses. Enter the African National Congress (ANC), or actually the arrival through fits and starts of lawyer Nelson Mandela into the ANC and you have a leader who the world came to know as the icon of that organization. And this film, Nelson Mandela: A Long Walk To Freedom based on his 1995 autobiography and which opened late in 2013 as he passed away traces the evolution of the man from a free-lancer lawyer to a serious anti-apartheid revolutionary leader.

Of course any political liberation movement, the black civil rights movement here in America with its bookends of Doctor King calling for non-violent resistance to the oppressor for the redress of grievance and Malcolm X calling for by any means necessary or the freedom struggle in the early days in the ANC with it non-violent resistance policy and after Sharpsville with armed resistance, has to deal with how it will conduct the struggle. Nelson Mandela (played in a very strong performance by Idris Elba) as shown graphically in the film as the repression worsened helped move the ANC from one policy to the other as the  circumstances dictated and paid the price. That price being the incarceration along with the central leadership of the ANC on desolate Robbins Island for over twenty-five year.

Now in this country we are no strangers to the plight political prisoners, particularly back in the 1960s and the heyday of the Black Panthers some who are still languishing relative obscurity in American prisons. And that has been the fate of any number of political prisoners over the years in many countries. The different in South Africa was that Nelson Mandela and the struggle for his freedom was made a continual international campaign. And in a sense as the film also shows there was no more tireless freedom fighter in her own right for Nelsons freedom than his second wife, Winnie (played by Naomie Harris). Obviously the love story, the long term deprived of love one story, is a good cinematic hook to tell the story. Tell the story of a personally-driven struggle to get her man back at first. Then as the years passed and new generations were coming to the struggle with more in-your-face ideas about how to bring down the regime how Winnie moved politically to Nelsons left on the need to do that (as well as growing personal estrangement). That shift in the struggle as exemplified by the Soweto uprising in the mid-1970s did not get enough attention in the film since Nelson was removed from what was going on. That too is the plight of the political prisoner isolated as new possibilities emerge and constituted a strong reason to get him out of jail-fast.",1410998400,,3620,4.960461285008237

I have walked a long walk to freedom.  It has been a lonely road and it is not over yet.

I know that my country was not made to be a land of hatred.  No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin.

People learn to hate.

They can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart.

The above comes at the very end of this engrossing movie that is based on the 1995 autobiography (entitled Long Walk to Freedom) of Nelson Mandela (July 1918 to Dec. 2013).

This movie chronicles Mandelas early life, education, marriage to Winnie Mandela, and his 27 year prison sentence before becoming South Africas first democratically elected president in 1994.

I found that this movie was very realistic.

This movie is just not about Mandela (Idris Elba) but is also about his second wife, Winnie Mandela (Naomie Harris).  Both actors do a good job in their roles.  Elba seemed to have a certain charisma that kept me drawn to the movie.  (The real Nelson Mandela also had charisma.)

The background music was impressive.  It featured music of Bob Marley, U2, etc.

This movie was filmed entirely on location in South Africa.

This movie has not yet gained enough in box office receipts to reach its break-even point.  Im not sure why.  Its a well-crafted movie with good acting thats intensely emotional and deeply stirring.

Finally, the DVD itself (released 2014) has two extras.  Both are interesting.

In conclusion, this movie details Nelson Mandelas extraordinary journey to becoming one of historys most iconic figures!!

6107285,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"Until now, I only knew Mandela's story in a superficial way. Of course, everyone knows of his long imprisonment and eventual rise to the presidency of South Africa. However, this film brings to light his early days as a child, his strong family ties, his time as a human rights activist, and his years in prison during which he mellowed into a person of grace and peace. Idris Elba inhabited the role of Nelson Mandela in a credible and impressive manner. He adopted the mannerisms and speech patterns, and made you forget that he wasn't the ""real deal"".

One of the most interesting things that I learned from the film is that he and Winnie essentially switched roles. She became more strident and in support of violence to achieve equality, whereas he adopted the peaceful route. The film covers a very long time span, and in the process gives only a superficial coverage to the political and social upheaval of the time. Sometimes I just wished for more background or explanation of what was really happening in the country. The turbulence was acted out visually, but lacked substance - it was frequently just violence without explanation.

Nevertheless, it was an impressive production with some sterling performances by accomplished actors.",1404950400,,1245,4.952153110047847

6107298,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"This biopic traces Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela from his days as a young attorney in the late 1940's until his election as president of South Africa in 1994.  As the apartheid white minority government began an even more oppressive regime, the country's native majority begin to protest.  Often in large crowds but always peaceful.  When the government began to crack down on the protests, their violence increased, eventually leading to shooting non-violent protestors, including children.

Mandela (Idris Elba), along with a handful of others, become leaders in the African National Congress.  Ultimately they retaliate against the government with their own brand of violence.  Mandela and his cohorts are eventually caught and imprisoned for life, initially on a remote island off the coast.  Nelson's wife Winnie (Naomie Harris) is imprisoned herself for many months as the government increases their oppression.

Much of the film revolves around Mandela's years in prison where he begins to believe that peaceful means will eventually win out.  On the other hand, Winnie's hatred of the government fuels continued violent resistance.  Director Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl""), with a screenplay by William Nicholson based on Mandela's autobiography, does a commendable job providing scope and substance of Mandela's adult life which included many years behind bars.  You can pick up where this film left off with 2009's ""Invictus"" if you want a double feature.  Elba's performance deserves more accolades than he received during award season.  He is very effective as the great world leader.

The Blu ray transfer comes from Anchor Bay and it's terrific.  It comes in 1080p resolution with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is consistent throughout with just a hint of grain.  Colors are excellent and range from the opulent settings of the presidential home to the deplorable conditions in the slums.  Detail is excellent as exemplified in much of the clothing and facial close-ups.  There is nothing to complain about.  Ditto the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  This soundtrack is perfectly balanced giving the viewer a sense of immersion within the film itself.  Natural sounds like wind, rain storms and animal sounds are perfectly staged.  Dialog is properly focused upfront.  Overall an excellent job.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH. Here are the extras:

Based on Nelson Mandelas autobiography, the film follows his life from birth through to repeal of Apartheid and his being the first democratically elected president of South Africa.

What did I think?

This film revealed to me how ignorant of Apartheid I really am, doing so in a way that left me wanting to educate myself more on this  horrific period in human history. A beautifully constructed experience that simultaneously highlights all that is good, and the potential for evil within  the human condition.

I have nothing more to say on this film other than go see it.",1401667200,,592,4.811881188118812

6107307,3,B00GSBQ2HU,"This film changed my thoughts about Nelson Mandela and not in a positive way. I guess I will have to read the book to see what his actual words and thoughts were, but this movie leads me to the opinion that Mandela was basically a nobody (albeit a caring nobody) who was selected and supported by the white establishment to ease the tensions of the oppressed blacks who finally were rising up in protest against the rich white land owners. Mandela appears to have been pushed into the lime light to gain notoriety and fame and yet even today the blacks in SA remain poor while the whites have retained their lands and their power.

I have always thought that the ""love"" of Winnie Mandela is what kept Nelson alive as well as the ANC Movement against the most demeaning control and demarcation over those also made in God's Image, but denied human treatment due to nothing other than the color of their Skin.  I wish there had been a little more portrayal in the Movie about the life of Winnie Mandela.  I do not believe from what I heard in South Africa, that she became an Enemy of South Africa and Nelson Mandela.  Of course, the acting was ""Superb.""  Well Done!",1400457600,,785,4.5177304964539005

6107351,2,B00GSBQ2HU,"Frankly, as a ""black"" American, I would think (on a whole) that ""blacks"" would have a better understanding while exercising objectivism compared with our perpetual civil rights struggles (Bill of Rights, 4th, 5th, 14th and 15th Constitutional Amendments) from dissidents - especially such violations from officials sworn to ""protect and serve.""

The entertainment industry's dogma, ""character assassinating"" Hollywood hasn't help matters.  ""Black-on-black"" crime, the usual social challenges after (so-called) segregation-to-integration in many ways are not much better.  Should all be forgotten or placed aside whenever ""Hollywood land"" decides to contrive a film in homage of a particular ""black"" person for adulation?

And, what about another infamous South African *colored* (lawyer) named Mahatma Gandhi?
Gandhi is also an idolized hero, yet this particular South African lawyer - Gandhi - was one vile, vehement and out-spoken racist hypocrite against ""blacks.""

Gandhi was also known for his outspoken anti-Semitic views.  The Dr. Martin Luther King lauded this hypocritical idiot (Gandhi) as the *poster boy* for peaceful protests and ""the path"" for civil rights strategies.  Yet, the only cause Gandhi advanced was entirely self-serving and for his fellow ethnic clan kinship of / from India.  And, what of Mandela's Israeli and South African Euro-Jew ""relationships"", not to mention the results of his close ties with Yasser Arafat and the PLO?? ... Yet, as significant as this was, it was not even included or alluded to in this movie.  Of course not.  There is much about ""Rolihlahla,"" or figuratively translated ""Troublemaker"" which should have been included about the Thembu, (Xhosa) runaway.

Too much remains untold within this movie, and many significant events akin to the struggle for equality within the R.S.A were never touched on - Mandela certainly did not do it alone - if one thinks race relations among ""blacks"" and ""coloreds"" are better, please think again.  The age-old system and attitude of partiality and discrimination prevails today in South Africa.  Their *colored* classification remains vexed and within the middle of it all, along with various other minority and weaker indigenous tribes. I think South Africans need to tell their own story about ""Dia baba"", the (feverishly corrupt) ANC, and ""the long walk to freedom"" - which is far from over.

Although the England-born actor, producer, singer, rapper, and DJ ""Idris"" Elba is charismatic and talented, I think he should not have been cast in the role of Nelson Mandela, just as Denzel Washington really had no business portraying Steven Biko... As if there are no competent ""black"" South African equivalents.  South Africa hosts tremendously talented personas and actors --- of which, many would have delivered an astonishing ""silver screen"" performance that would rival their English and American counterparts.  The late Henry Cele (Shaka Zulu) comes to mind, and so does the fabulously theatrically gifted and multi-talented Presley Chweneyagae (Tsotsi).  Indigenous South African ""blacks"", or ""coloreds"" know their landscape, colloquial expressions and a diverse range of universal mannerisms as well as anyone.  But, as usual Hollywood manipulation and politics wins their own coveted kewpie doll (Oscars) award.

""Eish"", and, no matter if folks will admit it, the fact remains that many still carry thoughts that South African, or even African theater is presumptively ""unrefined and rudimentary"" in comparison to most Western or European film performances. Nothing could be further from reality.  South and East Africa teems with a rich and vibrant cultural history of para-dramatic theater involving traditional themes of tribal ""Ngoma"", ""Gule wa Mkulu"" and ""Nyau"" theater, through the Anglophone oppressive / apartheid civil rule (maintaining their own theatrical art societies)... To present.

Actually I saw a bunch of people get shot in the back.  Although actually there were lots of people in the race wars in South Africa who did get shot in the back actually more than the front.

I think one of the best things about the movie is how it illustrated that the South African people really had no choice.  They ere being killed, raped/tortured etc. just as much if they decided to fight back or not and the film really showed that fighting back was really just plain logical.

6107384,3,B00GSBQ2HU,"The story of Nelson Mandelas life is certainly an inspiring one.  He has touched the lives of so many people and given hope and paved the way for a better tomorrow for so many that telling his story properly becomes a great responsibility.  You cant mess this up.  Too much is at stake.  When it was announced that a film about his life was going to be released, I became skeptical.

This is a BIG story to tell, even at nearly two and a half hours.

While 2009 gave us a film that focused on a small portion of Mandelas life (a portion that this film doesnt even mention) it felt so unimportant (to the point where I never felt the slightest desire to see it, and still dont).  Despite this films horrible title (yes, it sounds like a Lifetime movie), the idea of covering so much of this mans life (all of it) was such an intriguing premise that I felt a strong urge to root for this to succeed.  Add to that the fact that Idris Elba deserves a role meaty enough to sustain his talent and Naomie Harris is one of those actresses who should have broken out in a big way YEARS ago, and you have me eagerly anticipating the day I can get my hands on this film.

Then it came and went without any real impact outside of that brief moment where it looked like Let it Go was going to LOSE the Original Song Oscar (really, it never looked that way, but The Globes sent shivers) and so it left me wondering just how well this film captured all it needed to capture.

For me, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom has the look and feel of a great Hollywood epic, but it lacks something very important; substance.  I know that that sounds rather harsh and maybe even inaccurate when you consider the weight that is associated (and rightfully so) with the name Nelson Mandela, but the truth of the matter is that when the film is over the audience isn't brought to any deeper understanding of who he is, and in all honesty his life almost feels vacant of real honest meaning.

Everything feels so superficial.

The problem with a film like this is that it tries to cover so much ground, it sacrifices key details.  So little time is spent on key moments in his life that it feels so unimportant.  His first marriage is basically thrown away, as is his relationship with his children, and what is even more alarming is that his fight for equality is given absolutely no depth.  There is no basis for his ascension to deity among the people because were only really given one or two scenes of him chanting with fists in the air to show us, supposedly, that he is a great leader.  His life was deeper than that, and so it was a shame to see it all get this kind of treatment.  It also doesnt help that the 27 years he spent in prison are portrayed as a mere plot point and not give their just detail.  The progression of time issue that was present in 12 Years a Slave was also a problem here.  Those 27 years take up about thirty minutes of screen-time and they all feel so condensed.  It felt like they were showing me 2 years, not 27.

The treatment this story received showed in the way the performances were crafted.  Idris Elba deserved a better script and more time to develop this man, because he had so much right.  His voice, his stance, his brooding all felt so alive and real and yet his character almost feels like a prop and not the center of the film.  Naomie Harris, who is usually so captivating, is horribly uneven here, and again this is largely due to the fact that so many aspects of her life are given such minimal time to develop.  Her numerous stints in prison fly by in a few moments and so her characters emotional anguish and eventual hardening feel too sudden and, like the rest of this movie, superficial.

The film is beautifully lensed and the score is marvelous (not to mention those costumes and sets, which scream of authenticity and are truly eye catching) but this film needed another hour or two to really develop.  Instead we are given an empty look at a rich life, and that is a true shame.",1395273600,,4009,4.316421895861148
6107385,4,B00GSBQ2HU,"I understand that it can be a challenge to cover the complexities of a movement that changes the course of life for people (politics, individual idiosyncratic nature of people, and relationships, etc.) because everything is important to know and in the interest of time and money and creative flow important aspects and people are often left out of movies and things are added that may or may not have been proven to have occurred.

How people viewed Madiba, Winnie, the ANC or any other important figure in this movement is varied.  Although, I find it interesting that the oppressed are often called terrorists when they fight back.  I was not there so I cannot attest to whether or not they were terrorists, but history has shown us all that they were certainly unjustly terrorized. As for the complexities of it all, I am not much interested in that debate. They called Dr. MLK, Jr, a communist too for wanting to be treated humanely and with equality.

As for the script, I dreaded watching this movie because like 12 Years A Slave I thought it would be hard to watch and parts of the movie are hard to swallow (like children dying), but to me it was a better life story because it resulted in a huge triumph to some extent.  I would not say it was a feel good movie but I felt better in the end (even if I already knew the result). This movie made me question whether or not I would have been a victim of violence or if I would have been brave enough to fight back. I certainly would have been angry.  I reflected on what it would would have felt like to be in their shoes-to be killed simply for not having a ""pass"" on me as I walked the streets of my own neighborhood; to have my child's murder ignored because the whites considered blacks to be animals and because the law/justice was less important than the power and terrorism of the white police and militia who were supposed to be peacekeepers; to be a mother who loses her innocent child to a police bullet; to be a family member of someone who was suspected of being a traitor to the ANC and set on fire; to be tortured like Winnie by police and broken to the point of hating white people and to be a white person attacked by angry mobs of South Africans as the social and political climate began to clash.  If the whites were scared of black retaliation, it is because they knew that their treatment of them warranted such a response (they would reap what had been sown over all of those years).  In other words, they knew what they (citizens and the government alike)were doing and allowing to occur was morally and legally unjust and they would be held accountable for the outcome. History repeats itself in this way-the oppressed always rise up eventually.  Mandela and the others were brave souls willing to die for their freedom.  That is what I reflected on as a viewer.  Still I had more questions at the end of the movie that need to be researched and answered.

I thought this movie did its job of pointing out a time in history that left a stain on the existence of mankind. Even if you are not a history or political whiz kid, you get the point it serves up.  Even if Mandela was guilty of doing heinous crimes, like so many oppressed who are first angry during their revolt, he realized that to hate those who oppressed him would only consume him and make him no better than them.  That is always a powerful statement. After all, we cannot move forward without the help and outcry for justice coming from others (locally or internationally).  This film powerfully illustrated to me that once things come together (a series of unjust and criminal actions, the right timing, the right technology, and the placement of the right people and influential leaders) change becomes inevitable.

I thought the acting was superb. The movie was over 2 hours long but it did not feel like it to me (maybe because I was cooking while I watched it), but I actually enjoyed this movie more than 12 Years A Slave. Many people in our family wondered aloud why Idris and Naomi were not nominated for their roles in this movie over the others who were nominated or in addition to Chewitel and Lupita, but that is a different can of political worms.

I watched it yesterday and I liked it enough to buy it today.",1395273600,,4269,4.466580976863753

His resolve continues to grow and eventually he becomes the face of hope and change. Before I started this movie I have to admit I was expecting it to be a little long and boring (it's almost 2 and 1/2 hours). I really liked the Winnie Mandela movie but sat down expecting to have to struggle through this. I was wrong. While the movie did drag in a few spots I have to say it did seem to movie pretty fast and kept me interested the entire time. The one flaw with this movie to me is that it seemed to not show how brutal and rough he had it while in prison, but I don't think that was the point of the movie anyway. After watching Morgan Freeman play Mandela my only thought was why would anyone else even try to portray him. Elba proved me wrong, he was great in this. While I did think that Winnie Mandela was a little better I did like this one much more then I expected to.

6107389,5,B00GSBQ2HU,"MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is a handsome, powerful, inspiring biographical drama that might have been enhanced had its running time been longer than the films current 141 minutes.  The movies one problem is that many of the political complexities of South Africa are skimmed over, so that if viewers are unfamiliar with the history of that nation, they are likely to be confused as to the how and the why certain events took place

Idris Elba delivers a compelling performance as Nelson Mandela, from his salad days as a young lawyer, through his years as a political leader and human rights advocate, which resulted in his serving twenty-seven years in prison, to his election as President of South Africa.  It is a portrait that not only presents the qualities that made Mandela a great leader of a torn country, but also his frailties as a human being.

Naomie Harris is equally effective as Winnie Mandela, Nelsons second wife who starts out as a sweet, virtual innocent, but because of the injustices of Apartheid, develops into a more radical and violent dissenter than her husband.  Script wise, the development and understanding of Winnies character would have certainly benefited from a longer running time.

The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital HD Ultraviolet combo package from Anchor Bay Entertainment has several extras, including audio commentary by director Justin Chadwick, a documentary, ""Mandela: The Leader You Know, The Man You Didnt,"" plus other Behind the Scenes featurettes.

6107390,3,B00GSBQ2HU,"At the heart of Justin Chadwick's film lies a wondrous central performance by Idris Elba.  Although facially unlike Nelson Mandela, he captures the great man's mannerisms and speech-patterns with uncanny accuracy.  Throughout his long life, depicted in MANDELA from his humble beginnings as a lawyer to his final accession to the Presidency of the Republic of South Africa in the mid-1990s, he comes across as a devoted family man, who is nonetheless devoted to the nationalist cause.  When faced with a choice between domesticity and politics, he inevitably chooses the latter option.  This might not necessarily be the best for him, but it is something that he believes he must do for the cause of the African National Congress.  Although not by nature a violent man, Elba's Mandela is nonetheless pragmatic; as the Sixties wear on, he understands that violence is necessary in order to advance the cause of African equality in the apartheid regime.  While this performance stands out in the film, the handling of post-1945 South African history is superficially handled.  We are not told why the apartheid regime came into being in the late Forties; nor does the film explain how and why it fundamentally differed from the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.  For the first half-hour, the film adopts a comic-strip approach to history; a series of apparently disparate sequences follow one another with little concern for historical coherence.  It is only when Mandela is sent to Robben Island for life imprisonment that the structure becomes more comprehensible.  When Mandela is released from prison, the film once again fails to provide explanations for the sudden outbreak of violence in the townships following his release, when it seemed that African was fighting African as well as the white minority.  Nor does the film acknowledge the contribution made by other members of the ANC (African National Congress) - for example, Oliver Tambo.  Viewers expecting to learn something about South African history since 1945 will be sadly disappointed.",1391040000,30,2062,5.196374622356496
