7955400,4,B00005UQ6E,"EEEEEEEEEEEE~!! *grin* I have to admit, when I first saw Weiss Kreuz, I wasn't that impressed. But the second DVD has begun the process of devloping a plot. *gaspith* Yes! The ""P"" word! In this DVD we get the first glance of Schwarz (SCHU-KUN~!! EEEE! *faints*) and get to meet Schrient. (TOT OWNS!! ..don't ask..) It leaves off with a cliff hanger, however, so if you don't want to rip out your hair and scream by the end of the DVD, you might want to order DVD #3. The outtakes are great~! A must see. *nudge, nudge* All in All...a wonderful anime and one of my all time favs.^^",1029715200,3,580,4.330275229357798
7955401,5,B00005UQ6E,"This series is just so awesome.  I know, it's no Cowboy Bebop or Lain, but this really is a great time.  Even despite flaws in its execution, it's turned out to be one of my absolute favorite shows.
It's the characters, their personalities and motivations, that draw you in.  Playboy Youji, cheerful Omi, temperamental Ken, and, of course, icicle Aya. (All I can say is, an animated character has no right looking as beautiful as Aya does...  Just something about those eyes...  Bishounen fans, eat your hearts out. ^_^)
The music is awesome.  Check out the opening theme ""Velvet Underground"", and the closing theme ""Beautiful Alone"".  First time I heard ""Beautiful Alone"", I hated it.  But listening to it a few more times really made it grow on me, and now I love it.  Also, there's one BGM that's so stellar, it just catches your attention instantly.  It's in the second episode, near the end... you'll know what I'm talking about if you decide to watch the show.
Then, of course, there's the animation.  As I'm sure you've read if you've looked at other reviews, it's not too great, even by TV standards.  Sometimes when I watch it, I really wonder what a gem it would have been if a little more money would have been spent on it.  Watch the OVA's for better animation, I hear (I haven't seen them yet).
It's not that the animation is terrible.  Not at all.  Many shots really are beautiful, and a lot of pains were taken to make sure the main characters always look good.  But some of the fight scenes are not as spectacular as other, more financially-backed anime.
But really, even despite the somewhat lacking animation, this show has really stolen my heart.  If you want an anime that has a good plot, (it picks up in DVD 2), and you really don't mind low-cell-count fight scenes as long as there are a lot of pretty boys to ogle (^_~) and intriguing personalities to unravel, then BUY this anime.  You won't regret it.
By the way, watch the subtitled version.  The seiyuu (voice actors), for the four leads especially, are just so perfect for their roles, there's really no need to venture away from the subtitled version.  Don't touch the dubbed version with a ten-foot pole... except to watch the ""outtakes"".  Those are absolutely hilarious.",1021420800,11,2252,4.650632911392405
7955402,5,B00005UQ6E,"I'm so glad I found this. I've been having trouble finding WK for sale in Canada, but it was well worth the hunt. *snickers* I love the outtakes, especially the ones where they manage to stay in character the whole time (Persia).
Now that the foundation has been laid, the story can be built. And built is has been. *cue the sinister music* But I won't spoil it: find out for yourself. THE BEST!",1021420800,,395,4.351351351351352
7955403,5,B00005UQ6E,"I got to say that I'm a big fan of Takehito Koyasu, and that's how i was intorduced to this series. The first dvd wasn't that bad, but it was a little disappointing, but this one totally makes up for it. In this collection, the focus is mainly on Omi, although it begins with Aya's past. When Weiss recieves a mission that is about the abduction of young children, Omi relapses into his own past, and how he was abducted. This dvd collection is definitely worth it, although it really [stinks] that it ends at a major cliffhanger...I can't wait till the nest dvd comes out.",1021161600,,573,4.415094339622642
7955404,5,B00005UQ6E,"When I first found out that the infamous bishounen anime Weiss Kreuz was being released in America, I freaked. I knew that I just HAD to have it. Anyway, I bought the first DVD, watched it, and was very disappointed. The animation quality wasn't that great, and the storyline for the first episodes was...to put it bluntly...cheesy. Well, I stayed true to the series, and bought DVD 2 (this one) when it came out. I was a little bit worried that I was just throwing away another 30 bucks, but I bought the DVD anyway. When I got home, I watched it...and was amazed. IT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD! The storyline's corn factor GREATLY decreased, and there was angst, and it was just a great DVD. Well...I'm kinda ranting too much here, but I just want to say. If Weiss Kreuz 1 disappointed you, don't get discouraged, for DVD 2 is very, very good! (Go buy it now! ^.~ )",1019865600,,858,4.40251572327044
7955405,5,B00005UQ6E,"As the previous review mentions, the episodes on this dvd are much better than the first.  When I first watched the series I was quite disappointed with the first few eps, but if you keep watching you'll become drawn in.  It's true that Weiss Kreuz isn't the greatest or best-animated series out there (though the OVA animation far surpasses that of the TV series).  But it's fun, has some great characters and has ended up one of my favorite series.
I watch my anime subtitled 99% of the time, but everyone needs to watch the English dub ""outtakes"" section of the dvds--it's hilarious.  And bravo to Media Blasters for providing subtitles for the seiyuu (Japanese voice actors) interview bits!",1018742400,,694,4.80672268907563
7955406,5,B00005UQ6E,"With the next five episodes of Weiss Kreuz (released in the U.S. as ""Knight Hunters""), the world of the four florist-assassin heros begins to open and the story starts to unfold. My personal favorite episode in the series, ""Fraulein"" (episode six), introduces us to the shadowy enemy that Weiss will tangle with for the rest of the series. As the episodes progress, we meet Schreient (a group of four quite insane female operatives) and Schwarz (another male quartet each with a certain supernatural ability), both of which work for Weiss' Aya's hated archenemy, Takatori Reiji. Or do they? Both of the groups opposing Weiss seem to have their own agendas as well.
This disc focuses more on Aya and Omi, where the previous disc featured Yohji and Ken more prominently. Omi's past is shown and some surprising secrets about his heritage are revealed. The plot thickens as more about the main characters comes to light, creating a fascinating set of episodes to draw the viewer in.
Anyone disappointed by the first disc definitely needs to give the second a try before giving up on the series. This second set of episodes is where the story begins to pick up and sympathies with the characters start to develop. It's sure to please and intrigue even the skeptical viewer.",1013126400,7,1269,4.852534562211981
