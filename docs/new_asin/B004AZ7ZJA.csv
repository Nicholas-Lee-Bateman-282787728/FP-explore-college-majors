4312770,4,B004AZ7ZJA,"1975's ""Lucky Lady,"" starring a winning trio of Liza Minnelli, Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds has never been on video, a real mystery to many movie fans considering this was 20th Century Fox's BIG Christmas release from that year. Long maligned as an outright dud, this film has actually much to recommend it. I think it may actually come off better today. What threw off a lot of people upon its initial release was its (for its time) jarring mix of low comedy, music, raunch, and downright brutal violence. Hey, it's a picture about RUM RUNNERS, people!

All three stars have great individual and ensemble moments, and there are many laughs to be had here. ""Lucky Lady"" is a lavish picture; you can see where the money went.

Reynolds in particulr never got his due here. This is a gem of a comedic performance. Hackman delivers the goods. Minnelli has a terrific musical number in the first few minutes, a Kander and Ebb song called ""Get While the Gettin' Is Good,"" which ranks right up there with any of those artists' better-known songs.

Although considered a misfire, ""Lady"" actually was not a box-office flop, although it didn't set the world on fire. It played for quite a few months after its release and was a durable surprise down South (where I'm from), where it was re-released twice (albeit with different ad campaigns, the new ones pushing the action elements of the movie).

If you are a fan of Liza Minnelli, pick up this one up absolutely. It's a performance that divided the critics (although she was nominated for a Golden Globe), but I think her blonde-bombshell act works beautifully.

Now on to Paramount for Liza's 3 unreleased pictures there: ""Sterile Cuckoo,"" ""Tell Me That You Love Me Junie Moon,"" and a personal favorite, her last big lead in a feature, ""Stepping Out"" (from 1991)! Hello, Paramount!",1289865600,37,1828,4.772151898734177

4312772,1,B004AZ7ZJA,"I saw this film  X-mas 1975. I watched it again yesterday...Ugh.  I am sad to say, it has not improved with time. I am a fan of all three stars. However, this movie is a dog !
A movie about prohibition, rum runners, and trio of unusual characters was a great premise for a comedy.  Stanley Donen did not pull this together.  Billy Wilder, using similar elements,  turned Some Like it Hot into a comedy classic.  ""Lucky Lady"" can best be described as a very ""unfunny comedy"".  The movie plods on very slowly. The writing is poor. The characters are not well developed or written.  The writer was over depending on Minnelli's, Reynolds and Hackman's screen magic and star power to carry this off. Each performer did the best they could with the roles they were given...but it was hopeless. You can't fill an hour and fifty minutes with a one or two joke story. The rest is explosions and shootings at sea. Neither fish nor fowl. The menage a trois angle was also a dud. Okay, so they both wanted Liza ?
The biggest misfire was placing Liza in a strawberry blonde wig.  She looks like a Rhesus monkey instead of a femme fatale. Amazon gets 5 stars for fast shipping and delivery. 20th Century Fox and Stanley Donen get one star, ""thanks"", and better luck next time.",1451606400,,1262,4.475982532751091

4312787,2,B004AZ7ZJA,"1975's ""Lucky Lady"" was probably hoping to make an equally successful film out of what was obviously inspired by ""The Sting.""  So they had the two rogues perhaps a little oddly matched and figured they could even add spice by making the film about a menage a trois, make it a quasi-musical with a few Kander and Ebb songs for Liza as a prohibition cabaret girl (cashing in a on those who still believed in her performance in ""Cabaret"") in a film about rum runner buccaneers.  Believing in the three stars could have counted for something, except that Burt Reynolds was one of them and he was getting near his irresponsible non-acting performances in the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" films and numerous others where mugging for the camera substituted for acting.  Gene Hackman, usually a good actor, seems almost to have surrendered to the impossibility of this film coming out afloat.  Liza gives the most professionally competent performance  as she probably felt a little responsible with the title and all but she is not good enough an actor to survive with a great performance.  Written by the duo who brought us ""American Graffiti"" in 1973, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and a usually great director, Stanley Donen, but Donen had prior brought us the gawking spectacle of Richard Burton and Rex Harrison as two stereotypical homosexuals in ""Staircase.""  There was probably more of a reason why ""Staircase"" and ""Lucky Lady"" were never on home video until Shout Factory brought us ""Lucky Lady"" recently than just oversight.  In ""Lucky Lady"" the three stars bombard us with ""irascible"" charm that embarrasses us as we are played for stooges who do not need believability in our stories more than the stars laughing and mugging and saying lines about ""fish farting.""  The movie is so expensive and indulgent that there is a log as an extra that counts down the enormous budgetary delays from filming on the sea (with no miniatures) that becomes just another one long joke.  With all the hoopla about how the movie was a gross miscalculation by 20th Century-Fox and a huge flop that went through three endings before the one that, because you just have to watch it twice, it really is not as bad as that.  Yes, the film is lucky that it can survive that first viewing successfully as almost entertaining despite the bad reviews.  But then, it really is a lot unfunny as it expects us to be wowed by, even with an extraordinary budget, really so little.  John Hillerman is pretty good as the villain, too, but Robby Benson is completely wasted, or then just too much a talent to see do so little and perhaps thereby mis-cast.  The photography has a kind of haze about it as if filmed through some kind of gauze filter, which is sort of nice.  The make-up jobs are generally not so good, as are hairpieces or lack of them (Gene Hackman needed some help in some scenes considering the magnitude of their star billing).  There is only luck in ""Lucky Lady"" to be had, no tears, no real laughs, no suspense, nothing like that.  You just can't believe your eyes what you had just seen.",1366156800,4,3073,4.692737430167598

4312790,5,B004AZ7ZJA,"For several years I kept checking to see if ""Lucky Lady"" had been released and was disappointed with every search.  When Liza Minelli's name came up recently in conversation, I decided to look one more time and was excited when the title popped up immediately.  The cast of Gene Hackman, Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli was inspired!  The movie brings to life the 1920's and the financially rewarding efforts to circumvent prohibition by running liquor from Mexico up the California coastline. It is entertaining in every way with excitement, humor and a unique romance that to some may have seemed a bit ""risque"" when the movie was released! It may not be ""Oscar"" material, but if you've not seen ""Lucky Lady,"" I think you're missing a good time!",1352332800,,747,4.8203125
4312791,2,B004AZ7ZJA,"You know how you want to see a movie, and when it comes out, how the critics give it a drubbing? You think to yourself, 'It can't be that bad', so you wilfully go and see it and find out for yourself that it stinks? Then you think 'when will I ever learn?'

I never did see 'Lucky Lady' on original release but it seemed too good to be true with the three stars and director Stanley Donen. Anyway I was trying to pass my high school exams and my mother wouldn't let me out of the house to buy a loaf of bread, much less go see a movie. Or at least that's how I remember it. So, after a long absence from this swive-mad age of video and digital technology, along comes 'Lucky Lady' which I confess I hadn't thought about for years. So, I buy it after all, and guess what?? IT'S NO GOOD! The plot is hopeless. Liza Minnelli in her blonde wig makes other blonde floozies look like the Queen of Sheba. Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds are hopeless stooges. And the action (if you could call it that), consists of moving booze from one ship to the other until it becomes pointless trying to figure out what it's all supposed to be about. And as  for Robbie Benson, you just want to kill him.

I was decidedly unimpressed, and aside from the obvious camp value of such a hopeless film, I refuse to say anything nice at all about this legendary flop. It's still a flop and I've just lost $15 and will never get it back again!",1315440000,3,1416,4.160583941605839
4312792,2,B004AZ7ZJA,"Two great songs, but no original soundtrack available on CD, so it's a moot point.
Three great stars floundering with fifth rate material, also a shame.
Since it supposedly took them a year to film this, and they felt they had to replace the ending, you'd think they would have had ample time to fix all the other mistakes.  Instead, they went with what they had: a gangster, action, comedy, with romantic overtones (of a sort).  They probably thought showcasing a ""titillating"" subplot might help sell the piece.  They overlooked one small detail on that score, it's been done before, and better, so it was nothing new or shocking.  Which leads right back to what they turned out, a movie that really doesn't stick to anything in particular; a movie that careens around, aimlessly bumping into things.  From ill-timed slapstick comedy to a brutal/bloody killing of a young character, this movie didn't know what it wanted to be (you can't be Sam Peckinpah and Charlie Chaplin at the same time).  Inconsistent is the nicest term I could apply to this film.
It did have some terrific scenes though, a line here, a song there, a comedy routine by Geoffrey Lewis as an incorruptible U.S. Coast Guard Captain that's quite funny and pops up from time to time.  This would have been a really good movie if they hadn't tried to toss in some brutality, courtesy of John Hillerman as a gangster named McTeague.  If they had only kept it light and funny this could have been a classic (characters with bullet holes in their heads tends to put a damper on things, quickly).  In the end, I felt sorry for the three actors trying to (un)successfully mesh their different styles, and ultimately failing.  Someone needed to steer them in one direction, stay on course, and not drift.  The replacement ending was also a little weird; in essence, they had 2 closing credit sequences: a montage of the movie's greatest scenes and the drawings shown at the beginning of the film.  A bit abrupt and confusing......what the movie was all along.",1309651200,3,2023,4.748571428571428

4312795,1,B004AZ7ZJA,"The only reason to watch Stanley Donen's Lucky Lady (Shout! Factory) is to hear the Kander-Ebb title track, hear the blond bewigged Liza Minnelli mumble the famous ""fish fart"" line and remember that Liza was having a mad love affair wtih co-star Burt Reynolds during the making of this silly romp about booze-running during the prohibition. Watch closely . . . that's a wig co-star Robby Benson is wearing; he had shaved his head for his role in Death be Not Proud and the tresses hadn't grown back yet. Lucky Lady is an unlucky comedy that tries, so hard, to be screwball. Instead, it's screwy. Liza chose this as her Cabaret follow-up? Yikes!

4312796,4,B004AZ7ZJA,"I was 12 years old when this came out Christmas of '75 and wasn't allowed to see it.  My parents used to check the ratings from the Legion of Decency before we were allowed to see a movie and this one probably didn't pass the mustard.  I wasn't allowed to see ""Jaws"" but that's another story.  I was allowed to see ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" which I found to be very strange.  My only recollection of it is the endless television campaign for the flick that seemed to saturate the airwaves for months.  Surfing the Amazon site I stumbled upon ""Lucky Lady"" purely by accident and my interest was piqued.  I've always been a big fan of both Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds not so Liza Minelli.  I found ""Cabaret"" boring and her performance overrated.  That said, I found ""Lucky Lady"" immensely enjoyable...to a degree.  For at least the first half of the film it's a rollicking fun screwball farce and all the principal actors are terrifically entertaining.  Director Stanley Donen perfectly captures the Depression Era's sights and sounds.  Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's script crackles with wit.  It's in the film's second half where it starts to break down.  It devolves into a boring menage-a-trois between the three stars and there's semi-graphic violence that's more at place in a Peckinpah film than one of this nature.  On the whole, though, there's more to recommend here than not so I have no problem giving ""Lucky Lady"" my qualified endorsement.",1297468800,4,1462,4.772908366533865
4312797,3,B004AZ7ZJA,"In the wake of Seventies nostalgia for Depression-themed comedies like Paper Moon and The Sting, 20th Century-Fox gave legendary director Stanley Donen (Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Charade) a big budget, two hot screenwriters (American Graffiti's Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz), and a literal boatload of stars (Minnelli, Hackman, Reynolds)to film what was to be their big Christmas blockbuster of 1975.  Critics weren't especially kind and the film wasn't exactly the box office smash that Fox was counting on, but it did do reasonably well (it grossed over $24 million according to IMDB)and Minnelli's performance actually earned a Golden Globe nomination that put her in the same company that year as Barbra Streisand, Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, and eventual winner Ann-Margret. I have to admit I've always had a bit of a soft spot for this film.  It was the first movie I ever saw at Phoenix's legendary (and now sadly vanished) movie palace the Cine Capri, and the film's beautifully photographed sets, costumes, and stars looked fabulous.  While the film's tale of Prohibition-era bootleggers does veer unevenly between comedy, action (sometimes quite violent), music, and romance (the Burt-Liza-Gene menage comes off as a bit kinky even today) it is nonetheless stylish, offbeat, and quite entertaining.  And Liza, in full-on bombshell seductress mode, was never sexier.  I'm glad that Shout Factory obtained the rights to release this on DVD given how Fox seems to have practically disowned it over the years (I don't think they ever even released it on VHS, though it does occasionally appear on the Fox Movie Channel.)  It's not exactly a lost masterpiece but it certainly deserves better that its reputation suggests.",1294617600,9,1756,5.253571428571429

Liza, Burt and Gene seemed to be having so much fun while making the picture even though I had read it was a very difficult shoot on location.  Early on I read that George Segal who was originally playing the Gene Hackman part dropped out because he was not pleased with the conditions they were working under.
