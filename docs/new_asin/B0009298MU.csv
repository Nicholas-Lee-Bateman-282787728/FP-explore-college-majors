2260118,4,B0009298MU,"It's no surprise that Jill Ritchie's Janet is the only cast carried over from Robinson's first film short of the same subject and title.  Most people who have seen this film didn't realize it until I mentioned to them that Janet carries the load in both films when it comes to comic relief.  Jordana Brewster's Lucy Diamond is such eye candy, she really didn't need to act or have any lines.  I guess that's why she even had extra time to lip sync an Erasure song.

I thought this movie would be a big hit with the current ""liberated"" heterosexual culture who finds chicks kissing hot (but guys kissing disgusting).  In fact, there was a scene in the movie that alluded to this selective homophobia in our culture.  Anyway, why let politics get in the way?  Enjoy the film for it's good clean fun.  Ritchie is totally irreplaceable in her routine.  I just wish we had more of her.

And I still don't understand how the girls were able to switch places on the suspended swing in mid air after they slid back to Amy when her ex disappeared.",1112572800,3,1038,4.444444444444445
2260119,5,B0009298MU,"Lots of people, including the venerable Ebert and Roeper, bash this movie for having no plot, bad acting, and unbearable cheesiness.  I cannot defend this movie against people who made those claims.  I can only say that I, as an audience, was truly entertained by this charming and witty little film.  What can I say?  The movie worked for me, and I was guiltily won by its unique charms.

Ebert's main criticism was that had this movie been about a heterosexual relationship, the plot would have been so absurdly mundane as to be unfilmable.  ""The only thing going for this film is the lesbian relationship"".  I agree.  However, he misses the point that we are precisely here to watch a lesbian relationship, not to see some top-notch spy action thriller.  We are not even here for the comedy, primarily.  We are here to see a film in which a lesbian relationship is portrayed in a positive, light-hearted way that ends with a happy ending which, if you are a connoisseur of lesbian films, you will know is surprisingly rare.

Lesbians, and friends of lesbians (like me) are starving for good positive portrayals of women loving women; not as a guilty side story, not for shock-purposes, but as the main centrepiece of movie.  D.E.B.S. succeeds because it portrays the central relationship in a refreshing, matter-of-fact way, while at the same time acknowledging that this is not the norm in our society.  This is a very delicate balance that the film succeeds in perfectly.  D.E.B.S. also succeeds because of its witty lines, sweet easy charm, and the fact that it's a good-natured film.  To anthropomorphise the movie, D.E.B.S. is like a kind-hearted, adorable girl whom you can't help but like.  Its heart is certainly in the right place.  I'm so please, by the way, that this film received a PG-13 movie.  Finally our country is realising that homosexuality by itself does not award an R-rating.

I thought the acting was in general very well done.  Jordana Brewster in particular is irresistible and just believable enough to play the delicious lesbian ""supervillain"" Lucy Diamond, whose combination of hotness and insecurity are enough to cause formerly-straight government spies to question their orientation.  Does she really look tough and/or mean enough to be the head of an international criminal syndicate?  No, not really, but it works in this movie's slight off-kilter, over-the-top world.  The love story between Brewster's character Lucy and the other main character, Amy, is adorable, sweet, funny, and ultimately heart-warming.  You really do believe that they work as a couple, and want them to drive off into the sunset living to live happily ever after in Barcelona.

One quick word about the absolutely stunning Devon Aoki (Dominique), who plays the chain-smoking, hapa D.E.B.S. agent who's a sex addict and speaks with a French accent.  Obviously her character was designed (and in the movie chosen) for the precise purpose of enticing and seducing men sexually, almost in a comically stereotypic way.  (French accents typically being very appealing to American men).  The grand irony perhaps then is how well it worked on me.  Aoki smoulders on the screen in her few scenes with a kind of almost intolerable sexiness that destroys both reason and resistance with seemingly little conscious effort.

There are many different ways to enjoy D.E.B.S.  However, it certainly does targets a certain type of audience, and perhaps it takes one with a certain mindset to be able to enjoy the movie.  But if you're one of them, prepare for a rare treat.",1112486400,210,3569,4.986463620981388
2260120,5,B0009298MU,"For the sisters (and other kin) out there who feel enough celluloid has been wasted on seemingly inescapable dogmas of queer film- coming out, coming out then going back in the closet, coming out then committing suicide- D.E.B.S was created especially for you.  Written and directed by the multi-talented Angela Robinson, this feature-length version is anything but your usual gay fare; it's smart, it's beautiful, and best of all, it's funny!

The plotline, at first glance, reads like the typical Hollywood staple of heroes versus evildoer.  Four teenage spies- Amy, Dominique, Max and Janet- from an elite paramilitary organization known as D.E.B.S have been assigned to follow the movements of the gorgeous crime heiress, Lucy Diamond.  Of course, things go very awry and get very complicated very quickly, much to our pleasure.  Mix in a dash of sassy one-liners, a big dollop of pop-culture satires, blend with a kickass soundtrack, and heat it up with some steamy chemistry, and Ms. Robinson has a delicious debut that will surely draw comparisons to Charlie's Angels and But I'm a Cheerleader.  The only thing left half-baked would be the special effects, which feel at times like premature sketches on the storyboard.  That aside, kudos to the casting team for picking out some fresh faces who work well as an ensemble, and have genuine talents to offer besides being obvious look-alikes.

D.E.B.S is in every way a fresh departure from the has-beens of LGBT movies, and a herald of great things to come.  From my perch at the top of the Brattle Theater, the future of queer film just got brighter.",1111622400,13,1607,4.98876404494382

I was a bit concerned buying a used DVD that was meant to be a Christmas present, but once I got it in the mail I realized my concerns were unfounded. The case itself was still in really good condition with no tears or staining on it. The disc had no scratches or anything on it other than a few finger smudges that I assume came from whoever was quality checking the disc, which made me feel good to know they actually took the time to do that! I popped it into my laptop to give it a quick test run before wrapping it and was quite pleased that everything turned out wonderfully. The disc didn't skip, audio was all there, and this was the special edition as well that had a few extra deleted scenes! Very happy with my purchase.",1483401600,,898,5.108843537414966
2260132,5,B0009298MU,"You know that old commercial for Reese's?  Two guys bump into each-- ""you got peanut butter in my chocolate!""; ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter!"".

 That's DEBS, except the guys were screenwriters-- ""You got cheesy porn in my teen spy comedy!""; ""You got teen spy comedy in my cheesy porno!""  I don't mean to say DEBS is raunchy or pornographic, but the teenage schoolgirl does fall in love with lesbian villain, while her band of spunky school girl pals use all the spy gadgets in their arsenal to track her down and finish their mission.  The point is that this movie is one of the most bizarre things Hollywood has ever produced.

If you go in expecting to see a circus freak of a movie, you won't be at all disappointed, and you'll have a terrific time.  If you want to watch a lesbian romance movie or a teenage spy movie, I suggest you look elsewhere.",1481155200,,862,4.452229299363057

The stupid jokes (like Devon Aoki's crazy accent) help to create wonderful world where evil isn't all that evil and love stands a chance.

2260204,5,B0009298MU,"I can't count how many times I watched this fun movie.

College Intelligence Agent versus rockin' master villain with a romantic twist.
I actually like all the characters and actors and it is quite rare I can't point at, at least one character I wouldn't mind perishing.
The mood is light (fluff, camp), the action is fun, laughter to be had, characters are respected and the cast is hot.
The themes are positive.
The sound track is great.

Yes, some of the special effects could use improvement (dare you to do better with that budget).  Plot? It's an action flick, lol.  Gritty 007 ladies reboot this isn't.  Dramatic oscar darling, no way.  Feel good rare breed movie - yes.

I have two kinds of favorites - critical (I rewatch once a year or less) and I can watch it all day long on repeat without wanting to throw something.  This movie is the re-watchable favorite, sort.  It's rare in its class.  That gives it five stars of satisfaction from me, as I do indeed love it.  I bought this ages ago, from a real store.

If you're a Jordana Brewster fan, you need this.  If you're not one, you might be once it is over.  This movie made me notice her in ways, I hadn't in her other roles before this (The Faculty, The Fast and The Furious).  Her acting in The Invisible Circus was noteworthy, but I didn't see that until after

I don't agree replace Lucy with Lucifer and the movie is out there and its really, really bad.  I don't think I've seen\read a het movie that could be its ugly cousin.  For that matter, there's really only SALT out there on the leading lady protagonist front, which is a very different movie.  D.E.B.S. isn't about having a player protagonist or antagonist and most of the higher profile espionage action flicks, drama or comedy wise (Austin Powers).  Maybe the closest thing out there is Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which is more R-rated adults and is as big budget as it gets and very different from PG fluff.  I guess I see the Charlie's Angel comparison, but you don't really care about the characters in that movie, as much as you do here.  Also Angels has so much more objectification going on there.  The Angels are dumber and less empowered.  I love Drew, Cameron and Lucy and actually enjoyed Angels.

Also, a lot of times I never get around to it, but listening to the commentary is actually worth it.  There's interesting tidbits, both prurient and otherwise.",1361059200,,2390,4.512820512820513

2260214,4,B0009298MU,"Hidden in the Scholastic Aptitude Tests are questions designed to test a person's ability to lie, cheat, and kill. Those who score high enough on the test are offered a shot at enrolling in the D.E.B.S. Academy, an elite school for college-age spies. The best-of-the-best at the school are Max (Meagan Good, The Cookout), who's her squad's leader; Janet (Jill Ritchie, Breakin' All the Rules), the requisite ditzy one; Dominique (Devon Aoki, Sin City), the team's resident slut; and Amy (Sarah Foster, The Big Bounce), who's the only person in history to get a perfect score on the recruiting exam. The four friends are assigned to tail Lucy Diamond (Jordana Brewster, The Fast and the Furious), a supervillian who has reappeared on the world domination scene after a year's absence. Amy and Lucy come face-to-face in the heat of battle, but each is unable to take down her opponent. Seems they kinda want to get to know each other, if you know what I mean.

D.E.B.S. began life as a comic book writer/director Angela Robinson created and distributed to her friends (Robinson says the idea originally came from a fellow NYU film student who claimed to be a real-life D.E.B.; Robinson also says she originally believed the young woman's story, although I'm not really sure why she'd care to admit that); Robinson later turned the comic into a 10-minute short that was screened to enthusiastic response at Sundance in 2003. (In interviews, Robinson has said she created the short as an attempt at an ""outrageous WB-type thing.""  Robinson toyed with the idea of turning the tale into a series of Flash Animation Web shorts, but eventually decided against that. She wrote a feature-length version of the story; Screen Gems and Sony offered her the chance to shoot it, but only if she could do it for $2 million, and in 28 days. She did, and the result is this- a fun, breezy comedy that will entertain you from the start.",1318636800,2,1917,4.806060606060606

2260219,5,B0009298MU,"First of all, this might not be for everyone and not because it has characters who happen to be lesbians. Grow up people. I say this because it's really kind of a B movie with great heart. Maybe a B+ movie if there's such a thing. It's also a parody of sorts and if you don't get that and take it too seriously, you're not going to have fun watching it.

That being said, I absolutely love and recommend this quirky little movie. It's one of my favorites and I fell in love with it right away. Casting was just perfect. I can't imagine anyone other than Jordana Brewster playing Lucy. She IS Lucy Diamond. What a great actress. Her facial expressions alone are worth watching the movie for. She's the bad gal but not so bad that we can't love her as we're supposed to. Sara Foster also plays Amy exactly as she should even if you want to slap her sometimes for her choices. The supporting cast are also good.

Part of what makes this movie such a gem are the special effects like the plaid security system at the D.E.B.S. house. Like I said, if you take it seriously you won't have fun.

Angela Robinson did a great thing in this film by making the main issue be 'good' being attracted to 'bad' and vice versa, not the fact that they are two women. This of course plays a part but it was more of a back issue. It helps to show lesbians in all different roles like this but not to make their sexual orientation the main issue. It shows that yes, they do exist, and no, it's nothing you need to shield your children from watching. I think this movie would be rated PG if the main characters were a guy and a girl instead of two women falling in love. The sex scene, which is not explicit at all, was cut out and put in special features yet it still got tagged with a PG-13 rating. There is some swearing but that's not infrequent in PG movies and if your kid hasn't heard these swear words before, you might want to let her out of the basement once in a while.

Anyway, since it looks like there probably will never be a sequel, if you want more D.E.B.S. goodness there is a fan forum with some excellent novel quality fanfiction at [...].

2260221,3,B0009298MU,"""D.E.B.S."" is a film that has good intentions but doesn't completely work the whole way.  Before I got to view it, I was hands-down ready to tear this movie apart, making silly comments about it being comparable to ""Totally Spies!"" or being a half-hearted spoof to the classic woman-dominated shows that will be adapted into lackluster movies.  Surprise surprise, this is not a spoor nor is it an homage an all: it's a star-crossed lesbian romance with a bit of espionage.  I expected homosexual overtones, but not quite like this.

The movie's premise started in an ladies academy for young spies, and one of the teams is on mission to watch over a nefarious villainess named Lucy (Jordana Brewster); as far as villains go, Angelica from ""Rugrats"" is more threatening than her.  The leader and perfect achiever of the team, Amy (Sara Foster), confronted Lucy after a mission went horribly wrong, and the villain started to take an interested in the girl before she escaped. Later, Lucy kidnapped her and showed the goody-goody the time of her life in a crappy club, and though the two had their initial hostilities, they eventually fall in love with each other.  That sudden feeling of infatuation has put Amy in a crisis against her own team, since she's flirting with the enemy, and thus is the story the whole thing.  No traveling across countries to find the baddies, no elaborate fights on top of hills, no dress-ups, it's just two girls secretly locking lips.

Part of me wish ""D.E.B.S."" WAS a Charlie's Angels spoof/homage, because the lesbian romantic pitch ran dry since Lucy and Amy together don't really make a fascinating couple.  I do appreciate it heading a different direction from its own genre, and I do like how Lucy tries to clean up her image just to get Amy's attention, but it seems more interesting when it's being the spy girls angle.  Sure, it has the typical prissyness, but it does have an edge: the girls swear like reality stars, they use lethal guns, and it has its share of raunchiness among the cast.  Meagan Good's character acts and talks like Omarosa by how vulgar and intimidating, and Japanese actress Devon Aoki plays a French character (?) who often smokes and sleeps with guys.  The dirty-mouth and the Frenchinese may be racy, but to me they're the best characters of the movie; not to mention reliable since they think about the job first.  These two together actually incorporated a funny scene when the girls were trapped inside a bank vault; it resulted in a cynicism and carelessness moment that had me laughing.

What's not funny is how cheap the movie is made.  Although these characters say that they travel around the world or how villains are plotting in certain fabulous locations, the movie's always set in the same Malibu location.  The CGI effects are very amateur, heck, the movie even used the same set TWICE; nevermind how gaudy the holograms were and how phony the computer-based bullet holes were added.  This could've been a little more ambitious if it had the budget.  All complaints aside, ""D.E.B.S."" is not bad.  It should be commended for trying new things, even if most of them didn't pan out.  The movie should be fun for the L word crowd.",1277424000,,3207,4.76491862567812

2260227,3,B0009298MU,"This colorful spoof of spy films is occasionally clever and fun but only for a while. It starts to get a bit dull in spots. It's telling that the film originally started as a short that has now been expanded to feature length. What sets it apart from other films is that the spys and villains are all hot women. The men exist in the background and are there solely to back them up.  Since it's a film with all female main characters that means that the romance is between two girls. The four D.E.B.S. (Sara Foster, Jill Ritchie, Megan Goode, and Devon Aoki) battle an evil super genius named Lucy Diamond (Jordana Brewster). No one has ever fought her and lived to tell about it. That is until she gets into a confrontation with the head D.E.B. (Foster). She is in awe of Diamond and is even writing her thesis paper on her. Both women are attracted to each other but seeing as how they live on opposite sides of the law and are mortal enemies a romance is out of the question. Or is it? Diamond sets to work winning over "" miss goody two shoes"" as she teasingly calls her and the romance blossoms. When word spreads to her fellow D.E.B.S. that their leader is literally sleeping with the enemy all hell breaks loose and Foster finds herself in the middle. The film never stops being fun and is usually entertaining. The best things about it are the soundtrack of New Wave hits featuring the Cure and New Order, and the amazingly hot Jordana Brewster as Lucy Diamond. This is a must see for Brewster fans since not only does she have several kissing scenes with Foster but she's just gorgeous to look at. A promising directorial debut from writer/director Angela Robinson. The DVD has a brief making of and two separate commentaries featuring Robinson on one and the D.E.B.S.

In this respect the movie has been horribly misrepresented by the fetish-porn styling of its cover: Don't be put off! This is a quirky, left-of-centre romance story which plays it cute and camp rather than provocative and sexy.

The film sees one of our DEBS heroines falling for their evil nemesis, Lucy Diamond. Subsequently, the girls play for laughs as the remaining DEBS try to catch aforementioned baddie whilst the central romance continues undiscovered, under their noses.

The director obviously had a message which was to show a positive spin on a homosexual or lesbian relationship. It was nice that it had a happy ending because I thought that Lucy was going to die at the end, but that would have ruined the movie.

Megan Good is really beautiful in this movie as Max, and so is Jordana Brewster as Lucy Diamond. Lucy Diamond was so halarious in this movie! She kept trying to get with Amy and Lucy Diamond was so cute with her nice smile. Some people might give a bad review of this movie, but it is what it is, and it depends on what you like.

2260233,4,B0009298MU,"Rarely do you get a watchable movie with this low of a budget, but director/writer Angela Robinson makes the most of it and creates a wonderful and amusing little film.  The bare bones of the movie is the hero and villain fall in love with each other.  I know it's not the most original of stories, but what makes it unique is that the hero and villain both happen to be women.  What makes it even more unique (and ultimately why this is a movie everyone should check out) is that the lesbianism/female-female relationship is never an issue.  The main conflict is because the good guy and bad guy (or girls in this case) fall for each other.  The fact that it's a lesbian relationship never really comes up.

Okay, so the story makes this movie good.  What makes it great?  Answer: Sara Foster (playing Amy, the good girl) and Jordana Brewster (playing the villain Lucy Diamond).  Not only are these two actresses gorgeous, but they have great chemistry on screen (a necessity for this story).  Their attraction to each other is very believable and they are a joy to watch throughout the entire movie.  Why Sara Foster is not in more films is beyond me.  She's fantastic.

2260235,5,B0009298MU,"D.E.B.S. the movie is a wonderful oddity. At first glance it is like Charlie's Angels, only less intellectual... But then, like an optical illusion, you change viewpoint slightly, and suddenly it's a surreal comedy. Teenagers in schoolgirl uniforms who are deadly superspies, indeed!

Proof that it isn't your ordinary Hollywood big-canvas thriller:
1) It has a lesbian lovestory at its center!
2) And one of the main characters smoke!!

A couple of examples of the wonderfully satiric touches: the supervillain, Lucy Diamond (!), played by the gorgeous Gordana Brewster, has to flee rapidly in a big convention center, and she stops to consult a diagram of the building...
And the same supervillain needs to find the girl she has the hots for, Amy, in an big building, so she pulls out a palm sized device, and on the screen magically appears a 3D wire diagram of the building. But not only that, rotating the diagram, red spots appears, the first two are labelled ""not Amy"", and the third one is labbeled ""Amy"". That's just a wonderful parody of the trappings of the spy thriller genre.

Sadly, to enjoy it you have to suffer the sight of pretty young women running around in very short skirts. Alas, everything good has a price.

By the way, what explains how it's untypical of a feature film is that it originated from a ten-minute film, which originated from a little comic book, and all done by the same woman, Angela Robinson. Even the feature film was done for $3.5M, which is ridiculous for any film and not the least a spy thriller, and it looks surprisingly good for it, in fact it looks good for a film of any budget.

Another of the actresses is Devon Aoki, a gorgeous girl who has the shortest skirt of the four DEBS. (""Mommy, why does he keep talking about skirts?"" - ""Shh, I think he's gay."") I suspect that she was actually the bread crumb trail I followed to this film. In DEBS she affects a hilarious French accent and addictions to both nicotine and sex. Update: it turns out she's a supermodel, but I'm not ashamed of not knowing that, since neither was the director. Also, Devon herself came up with that great accent.

Don't miss the commentaries. The director is real film geek, and the girls are cute and funny. The actresses' comments vary between insightful/funny and ""OMG, I love how your hair looks in this scene,"" so many times that they themselves start making fun of it.",1210896000,2,2402,4.666666666666667

The plot lines are solid, and the girls do not bend over backward to make a campy spoof scene.  Although the viewer may wish they were bending over backward, the scenes are flowing (as opposed to some campy movies which break stride to make a joke).

I really enjoyed the movie, and I know that I will treasure this one in my collection.

How can you lose?  Arse kicking, hot chics with lesbian overtones and lotsa leg and skirt action.  Teenage boys would love this.

The movie is well made, and I recall being very impressed.  Usually, a hot cover is a coverup for a bad movie, but in this case the cover is truly indicative of the actual film inside the case.",1206057600,3,771,4.298611111111111

The other is Lucy Diamond, a notorious and much feared criminal mastermind and lesbian, trying to open up to love again after a breakup 2 years ago. The movie is a hilarious spoof, which fully encompasses everything necessary to make an excellent spoof film, as well as showing a lot of leg.

I loved this movie from the first hilarious moments of awkward tension between the two women, and I continued to love it through all the exaggerated, unbelievable scenarios and adorably romantic moments. Plus, It has a really happy ending (though, like all elements of this movie, hilariously unrealistic).

I'm not a lesbian, but this movie appeals to everybody and anybody. It's charming, funny, romantic and memorable.",1201392000,5,869,4.9862068965517246

In this lifetime, I didn't set out to be, or pretend to be, a movie connoisseur, but currently, I'm 60 years old (and a white, heterosexual male, by the way, though my wife doesn't know I'm writing this review) and must have seen thousands, several thousand, movies.
Now, I have seen D.E.B.S. at least three times on my 37"" TV.  Liked it enough to buy the DVD.  It is fun and vastly entertaining - just as it says on the DVD cover.  Anyway, just received the DVD today and I watched it on my big screen (projector + 92"" screen).  WOW!  Even better!  And, I've noticed, you get to see every single FLAW in a movie when you watch it on a big screen.  D.E.B.S?  No flaws worth talking about!
I believe the writer/director, Angela Robinson, applies an ""eye"" - absolutely comparable to the famed Japanese director Kurosawa - to each and every single scene in this movie.
No intention to belittle Kurasawa, but in his movies, every now and then you would be STRICKEN by a fabulous framed shot.  In this movie under review - D.E.B.S. - those fabulous shots are so commonly encountered, they look, errrrh, commonplace.
Now, honestly, looking at the movie on my (new) big screen - I'm rather certain I have my priorities all screwed up.  That is to say, thinking about the camera angles, picture quality, beautifully framed shots.  Those are all wonderful, but, hey, this is a very pleasing love story (genders be damned), good plot, a ""real"" script, happy ending.
And, the more I think about it, a good movie for all ages.  Well, let's face it, Shakespearean plays were done with an all-male cast playing all the genders.  IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE!  So, here we have a love story featuring two girls.  I think any young ones, pre-adolescents, watching this would consider it just a fun ""play.""
I'll shut up in a minute.  But I have to think that Angela Robinson put more exhaustive thought, more tireless fashion sense, and more artistic eye and sensitivity into this movie than I've ever seen before in any other.",1193875200,7,2024,4.593314763231198

I've re-watched it a few times in the several months since I bought it, and it's always a bit of a cheer-me-up.  Call me a sucker for young love.

I do wish they'd have integrated the cut scenes into the movie, rather than leaving them as clips on another menu.

Low-budget action fare starring an entire all-female cast...that's playing secret agents with a love story to boot?  Not normally my cup o' joe.

Nonetheless, I stuck around and actually watched the entire product.  And while DEBS won't be remembered as a bona fide classic anytime soon, it's actually a fun little ride that both its target audience and people just looking for a good time will enjoy.  Played constantly with a tongue-in-cheek, wink-and-nod tone, it's tough not to find little pleasures in the absurdity of the DEBS, their pursuit of the least-likely master criminal I've ever seen and the developing romantic bond between the two leads.  Sara Foster and Jordana Brewster do some solid work with the material, playing it as ""straight"" as they can without ruining the goal.  The rest of the cast, particularly Meagan Good and Jimmi Simpson, handles their characters with a fun sense of aplomb.

Yeah, the story's completely implausible, the effects laughable, more than a few developments nonsensical, but if all you're looking for is an hour+ worth of easy laughs, you'd do much worse than DEBS.",1173830400,3,1258,5.102439024390244

It's has its degree of predictability but considering the limited budget allowed the film maker(Angela Robinson) I think she did a wonderful job. The technology, set designs and use of computer graphic effects appeal to my aestetic sense.  As a visual artist I was intrigued by the use of color with the set.  The juxtiposition of certain color groups in the background, the selection of vehicles and the choice of music worked really well. I have seen numerous films involving a lesbian relationship consisting of bad cinematography and crappy acting.  This film had a topnotch group of actors in tow.  The high definition presentation and lighting gives the film that independent edge.  Some might complain that the actors were straight playing the lesbian roles(J. Brewster & S. Foster) however, as an African American, I am resentful of typecasting because of the limitations that it places upon the actor and the perpetuation of certain stereotypes within our culture.  The only thing that I regret is the restrictions of movie/tv rating systems.  The results is the tame approach to the love scenes presented in this flick in order to (I guess) keep it from getting an R rating.  I saw the deleted scenes in the extras. The inclusion of the more physically expressed love scene in the initial film would have provided a flawless crescendo to the culminaiton of the lovers getting together.  Heck, I have seem much worst on regular TV. Some times love scenes in movies are at times too much and simply unnecessary.

2260258,5,B0009298MU,"First, as a straight male, I agree that this was a great characterization of a lesbian relationship. I found myself forgetting that it was two women, and merely hoping that they could make it work. Also as a straight male, the great looks of all the actresses didn't hurt, but that soon became background, sort of like after a while at a nude beach, it all seems normal. Or not.

Speaking of backgrounds, one of the reasons I enjoyed this movie so much was the obvious joy with which the cast performed in, and the crew participated in, the making of this movie. I'm going to point out some VERY funny jokes that were in the background that no one has mentioned, but not all of them - go watch it again, and find some on your own.

1. The ""punk bar"" itself. Those punks were obviously cast and crew members moms, dads, grandma, etc., who they called up and said ""Hey! Wanna be in our movie?"" Either that or, they were the oldest group of punks I've ever seen.

2. The ""punks"" were drinking out of glasses with ""bendy straws"", highly un-punklike behavior.

3. In this dangerous, underground punk bar, there was an undamaged foosball table. Doesn't this strike you as funny?

4. The pink fire hydrant.

5. Lucy's license plate - ""NDASKY"" - from the Beatles song ""Lucy in the sky with Diamonds"".

6. Perhaps the funniest, to me, joke was when Lucy and Amy sat down at the booth. Lucy set two beers down, one in front of each. The beers were Dos Equis, the logo of which is XX. What is the chromosomal difference between men and women? Men are XY, women are XX. This was a deliberatly placed joke. Two beers, deliberatly faced forward, one in front of each ""girl"", marked with the genetic symbol for ""girl"", in a ""girl/girl"" romantic scene. It was a deliberately concoted case of humorous overkill. That joke was one that someone thought up, everyone agreed that probably no one would get it, but said ""What the heck WE'LL know it's there, and it's funny!"".

7. The fact that she had a ""beef"" with Australia, of all countries, and that the large globe in her apartment had a big red ""X"" through the continent.

8. There's the ""handle with care"" signs in the final scene, but that's all I'm giving you, go look.

The point of this review is that some of these movies are a joyful labor for those involved. They know they're not going to get an Oscar, but they like the script, they like each other, and they go the extra ""Green Mile"" to put everything they've got, and everything they can think of into it. I often enjoy these small-budget movies more than their big-budget relatives, because they ARE labors of love, and that comes through the screen, as does the cast and crews affection for each other.

Too many were locked into watching beautiful girls in short skirts to look beyond them to the REAL humour and art contained in this movie. It's there, and it's worth the effort. Give it a shot.

I would add Kitchy and Hammy to those adjectives and then wonder why it is so many people (critics especially) watched this literally rather than as a farce, where the cheese, the ham, the kitch and the stupidity are there for a purpose.  Where have I seen a nymph in a school girl outfit wielding a weapon she couldn't possibly deal with to massive plaudits?  Oh yeah, Kill Bill.  Now that was stupid.  This was making fun of it in a hokey way. This was written in the same vain as say an Austin Powers.

The only thing that is serious in the film is the relationship and as generic as romantic-comedies have become, this should be given high praise for the cute, somewhat silly, believable romance. The fact that it is two women is better still because typically lesbians in film are a) background noise in a straight movie or b) the focus of a lesbian themed movie that ends up depressing the hell out of you (if these walls2, monster, lost & delirious).  And I just loved the matter-of-factness about their sexuality. Sure their relationship is questionable but not because Amy is questioning her sexuality, but because she has issues with Lucy's career:)

And on top of that, as a guy myself, I liked that the men were not utter douches.  The ex is needy, but not unlike a lot of guys I have seen after a breakup. But he's not bad.  And Scud was a great character, although he definitely was channeling some Ryan Reynolds.

Sure, this film evolved into a mild lesbian love story, and whether you are into that kind of thing or not, these two girls make it look like it was simply meant to be.  Lucy Diamond, the diabolical evil threat to national security and the overall safety of the world (but somewhat insecure with mild assertiveness), and Amy Bradshaw (superior in intelligence, but yet confused and cautiously submissive), come together with a pleasant teasing of hesitation that makes you (the audience) impatiently sexually frustrated because you DO want to see them get a moment together alone.  There is an extension of their time together on the bonus extras.

Yes, I'm a guy, and I'll admit that I usually like to watch (borderline) chick flicks, but what can I say?  I love watching beautiful women in film.  This is why I love Bollywood films!  (movies from India).  Bollywood has the most beautiful women you'll ever see on film.  A good example is ""Bride and Prejudice"" with Aishwarya Rai and Namrata Shiradkar (which is an american film made Bollywood style, with several famous Bollywood stars consequently speaking English, no subtitles needed).

Another one of my favorite movies to watch with beautiful women is ""Chasing Papi"" with Roselyn Sanchez and Jaci Velasquez.  This is sexiness, ""Latina style"".  Innocent enough for a general audience, but yet definitely: ""Hot delicious eye candy!"".",1142726400,4,1585,5.053846153846154

I finally rented it this year and was plesently surprised at how well it was written and how the director (Angela Robinson) did not try to hide the relationship between Amy (Sara Foster) and Lucy (Jordana Brewster) under a more mainstreamed heterosexual love story.  What was even more surprising was how much chemistry these two actresses displayed on screen.  It was not difficult at all to imagine them as being in love.

This movie is a funny as it is romantic, with all the characters frequently spouting off hilarious one liners and priceless facial expressions.  Angela Robinson did a wonderful job balancing comedy, drama, and a little bit of camp to make this a movie you will want to watch again and again.

The special features offer a bit of insight into how D.E.B.S came about as well as the people (both cast and crew) that are behind it.  The deleated scenes made some of the scenes in the movie make more sense and honestly left me wishing that many of them had been left in (especially the extended love scene between Lucy and Amy).

On a stakeout to watch Jordan Vrewster's Lucy Diamond she feels an attraction which leads her to start doubting her calling.

This film is obstensiblya silly romp with little redeeming valie. On the surface it can fall into the category of an American Pie or Not Another Teen Movie. There are some laugh out loud moments not only due to the outrageousness of plot and over the top moments but also due to some clever script writing. The movie watcher who looks just below the surface may notice that this movie is not just another dumb comedy but is actually quite clever in its handling of certain themes. Probably the most obvious of these themes are friendship and its true meaning as well as friendship taken to the next level love. Loyalty and trust are also addressed in this theme but then the movie also examines in an entertaining way expectations both of oneself and those that others place on oneself.  I really had little expectations watching this myself except to be entertained for 90 or so minutes and this movie exceeded them in its cleverness and fun value. It is almost a 21st century retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story in  a Juliet and Juliet twist but do not seek to ask readers of this review to dig that deep into the movie only that they give it a viewing and watch with an open mind and a metaphorical sling for their funny bone. Both Brewster and Foster are attractive young women which helps the movie out but this film is about more than eye candy.",1139443200,4,1816,4.581538461538462

The fact that the main characters are lesbian is not the point of the movie and there are fewer discussions of same sex relationships than in any episode of Will and Grace. It's hard to go into too much detail regarding the storyline without giving away the plot, but it's a fun story for younger adults or those who are still young at heart with a sense of humor.",1139097600,5,538,4.336633663366337

This may have been cheaply made but no one in the entire cast treated it like a cheap production. Performances across the board are at the very least solid and in many cases very good. Jordana Brewster, Sara Foster and Meagan Good are superb. To take this kind of fun low budget movie and give a committed performance tells you a lot about an actress.

However, I like things that make sense, movies that have good chemistry between actors and strong acting. Lets just say that the only good chemistry was between Lucy Diamond and the girl that was in love with her, forget her name. they had a nice little romance but the rest of this movie is so stupid. I mean, Lucy is an assassin, her job is to kill people and everyone she has fought has never lived to tell the tale, but there's a catch, she hasn't actually killed anyone before. I mean, is it just me or is that entirely impossible? I mean, where is the logic to this movie? how does anything in this dreadful film, pardon my french(lol), make any sense? I really wanted to like this film but it's just painful. I'd sad to say the critics were right and this is one of the worst movies of the year. there is nothing that makes sense and Michael Clarke Duncan has never been worse because I usually like this guy. though I do agree that Sara Foster is pretty sexy in this role. too bad her character is so phony though.",1137715200,,1349,4.357142857142857

Since when do spies deal with bank robberies? Much less spies in training?

2260276,3,B0009298MU,"I decided to flip on the television and watch a movie one night (around twelve)when I came across D.E.B.S. It seemed like a light comedy I could watch,and fall asleep to. Fifteen minutes into the show, I kept thinking ""Oh God, how could this movie POSSIBLY be any different from the other action flicks?"" Then I saw the plot twist. I definitely did not expect the character Lucy Diamond to be a lesbian. It was so surprising, I awoke from my drowsy stupor and gave the rest of the movie my full attention. I had a few problems though. Was it me or did they say the word 'love' every ten minutes during the course of the movie? And I thought that the characters had so much potential but they were not given much detail. I figure for an extremely low-budget film, I should not be making fun of the ""special effects"" and the ""props"". The things I really like about D.E.B.S., they don't objectify lesbianism. There isn't the deep tongue searching-for-buried-gold making out. You know, the movies now always have the complementary ""lesbians"" who are all too willing to have a threesome with some guy. There was none of that, and I was glad. The kissing was kept soft and sincerely sweet. Even the sort-of-sex scene, the camera isn't all up in the girls' faces or bodies. It's not soft-core porn.  I can totally buy Amy 'The Perfect Score' Bradshaw falling for Lucy Diamond. I don't buy them falling in love after knowing each other for like four hours. Also, the 'I Can't Be A Lesbian Because I'm Straight Or Am I?' was kept to a glorious minimum. The story isn't about questioning your sexuality [God knows we've seen enough of those.] It's about perserverence in what you believe in your heart even when your best friends are against you. I would recommend seeing this movie to prove that homosexuals CAN too be in a action-comedy NOT as sex objects but as protagonists. Definitely see D.E.B.S. Don't rush and buy the DVD. You may experience eye-rolling while you watch it.
The soundtrack overshadows the movie. It has such awesome songs from Garbage, The Cure and the movie ends with a number called Into The Morning by The Weekend [the epitome of how a secret realtionship is.] D.E.B.S. would have made a pretty kick-ass series though. Lighter and easier to watch than The L Word, which is really gritty sometimes.",1135987200,4,2314,4.64390243902439
2260277,4,B0009298MU,"I was flipping through the channels when I saw this movie's description saying ""The lead of a teen, all-girl crimefighting team falls for the villaness she supposed to apprehand.""  I thought at first that maybe this was a typo, maybe it was supposed to say villan, not villaness.  So I stopped and decided to watch it.

To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Granted this movie was kinda lame, the acting cheesy.  But how often do you see a comedy/spy flick with lesbian leads?!  Jordana Brewster has totally stolen my heart as the tough, yet sweet villaness Lucy Diamond.

It's not the greatest movie ever made, and there are somethings lacking, somethings that could be improved.  But this movie does what it's meant to do: entertain!",1135728000,3,747,4.826771653543307
2260278,4,B0009298MU,"Ok I admit it.  I watched this movie simply because it had a lesbian theme.  I've watched some truly bad lesbian movies and I figured I'd suffer through this one as well.

Well wasn't I surprised.

Recently I discovered I like Campy movies and D.E.B.S has definite camp. Picture the Charlie's Angels movies (not the old TV show although that kinda works as well.)  And you have the basic type of camp.

Add to it two good looking women who can act.  Hell add to it a group of people who can act.  The two leading ladies have chemistry which makes it all the better.

The only minus is a total lack of plot.  Don't expect A lesbian James Bond Movie (I never liked James Bond anyway).  The movie is completely and utterly plottless unless you count the love story.  Evil Villainess who can hold a county hostage can't seem to find a girlfriend and then runs head first into the one girl who should be her arch-nemesis (Not 'A' D.E.B. but 'THE' D.E.B. ""The Perfect Score."")  Well we all know how these things go.  Girl meets girl.........

Predictable story but who really cares.  The girls are hot.  They can act.  And they have chemistry.

What more do you really need in a lesbian movie.  Maybe one day we'll demand a plot but for now, chemistry is enough.",1134518400,,1256,4.425438596491228
2260279,3,B0009298MU,"You may not know this, but SAT is secretly used by the government to recruit students for professional secret agents.  You may not be aware of the fact, but America is secretly training these high school students in facility disguised as ordinary school, and some of them are actually given an important mission to arrest a dangerous thief called Lucy Diamond.  Oh, and this film is directed by Angela Robinson, whose next film happens to be Disney's 'Harbie: Fully Loaded.'

The only way to enjoy 'D.E.B.S.' is, Never take it seriously.  It's often delightful and silly, but it's not definitely 'Charlie's Angles' in which Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz do high-kicking kung-hu action.  No, action is not what 'D.E.B.S.' wants to do.

Except for the mayhem caused by shoot-outs (in which no one gets hurt), this film looks more like a romantic comedy with a difference, not about a boy and a girl, but two girls -- Sara Foster playing Amy, or Miss Perfect of the school, and Jordana Brewster as Lucy Diamond.  About Lucy, the school authority (including Michael Clarke Duncan) says, well, something scary like, after seeing Lucy fight, no one comes back alive.

But we know better.  We know Lucy Diamond is a 'good' girl even if she steals lots of money, and it doesn't take much time for smart Amy to realize that this 'killer' is not a bad girl.  But when the school tries to take advantage of their realations for their own promotion, Amy has to choose: her career or love.  But you know the answer by now.

The best thing for me is the surprisingly amiable characters of Lucy and Amy.  Their story itself is weak and predictable, but it is refreshing to see their love presented on screen naturally.  Sara Foster is credible, much better than in 'Big Bounce' and Jordana Brewster (her comeback since 2001) is also good as raven-haired Lucy who can steal, but who cannot rob.

But the film needs something more.  I hear there is another 'D.E.B.S,' 10 minute short directed by the same director, and perhaps the concept fits comfortably with this format.  Supporting characters are all paper-thin (though I liked the chain-smoking 'French' girl by Devon Aoki), and the humor is mostly what we have seen in other films set in high schools and dorms.

'D.E.B.S' is like an extended episode of TV sitcoms -- the story goes on slowly and pleasantly with occasionally funny moments.  The film offers not much, and pretty entertaining as long as you don't expect too much from that.",1129766400,,2480,4.752336448598131

The best part for me of course were the lesbian smoochies BUT that doesn't mean there was nothing else in the movie.  I think this movie was well written and had great people working on it.  The music fits perfectly PROPS to you music guy(s)!!!  I bought the soundtrack as soon as I watched the movie and I still haven't taken it out of my cd player.

Overall, you will like this movie if you like romantic comedies.  Plus I do think it's a step closer to getting gays and lesbians naturalized in movies.  These lesbians are normal girls they could be anyone and they have a  relationship just like straight people.  OH another great thing is how the lesbian thing isn't overemphasized. It is treated like a no big deal sort of thing. Hopefully more people will start thinking that way.

2260282,4,B0009298MU,"D.E.B.S. is a movie that ordinarily I would have not even been aware of; however, over a year ago, I found myself watching the short on which it is based on Sundance channel.  I was sufficiently entertained to buy this DVD when it came out, and was quite happy to have done so.  While D.E.B.S. is not a great film, it has what I would term a ""heart"" which makes it extremely enjoyable.

D.E.B.S attempts to blend two genres--it is both  a spoof of spy/action films and a light romantic comedy.  The spy spoofing consists of the efforts of the ""DEBS"" of the title--college students  in prep-school uniforms who are spies/crime fighters in training--to capture the ""badass master criminal"" of the piece, Lucy Diamond.  The ""DEBS"" in question are Max (the fanatic overachiever and team leader), Dominique (a perpetually smoking ""sex addict""), Janet (she's awkward, but sweet, and her heart's in the right place), and Amy (the straight-A spy-in-training who's unsure of her vocation).  The romantic comedy, which gradually becomes the dominant element of the story, concerns the romance that develops between Amy and Lucy Diamond.

It would be unfair to expect D.E.B.S., on a tiny $4 million budget and a very tight 28 day shooting schedule, to contain dazzling action scenes along the lines of the films it parodies, and it doesn't.  It perhaps would be more fair to expect it to have a relatively believable story-line, which it doesn't have either (Angela Robinson`s script does have quite a lot of good, smart dialogue).  But fairness would also compel us to note that few spy/action films or romantic comedies have plausible story lines, either.  When these films succeed, they usually do so because the actors involved succeed in creating likeable, engaging characters who allow us to ignore the holes in the plot.

On that front, D.E.B.S. has three definite positives, and no real weaknesses.  The biggest positive is Jordana Brewster, who plays Lucy Diamond, the nominal ""villain.""  The camera clearly loves Brewster, who is the center of attention almost every time she's onscreen.  She has wonderful talent for facial expression--there's one scene where she goes from projecting sadness to joy with just a subtle change of expression.  She gives Lucy the right blend of confidence and vulnerability to make her a sympathetic character.

The other positives are Jill Ritchie as Janet and Jimmi Simpson as Scud, Lucy's right-hand man.  Ritchie has great comic delivery (she gets a lot of the good lines and makes the most of them) and  (like Brewster) she proves the old adage that film acting, unlike stage acting, is done more with the face than the voice--some of her reaction shots are priceless.  As Scud, Simpson delivers a clever twist on the typical ""chief henchman"" role seen so often in the Bond films--instead of being a silent killing machine-type, he's his boss`s sensitive confidant and emotional support.  Ritchie and Simpson also display nice chemistry in their brief scenes together.

The other main players do not stand out like Brewster, Ritchie or Simpson, but they are all satisfactory.  Sara Foster as Amy holds up her end of the romance fairly well and has good chemistry with Brewster; she has a few awkward moments but rises to the occasion in her big speech at the end.  Meagan Good and Devon Aoki, as Max and Dominique respectively, do well with characters that are less developed than Lucy, Janet or Scud.  Good is probably the best performer in the action scenes, while Aoki deserves mention for one of the funniest faux-French accents since the days of Inspector Clouseau.  Rounding out the cast are Jessica Cauffiel as a Russian assassin (she's hilarious), Holland Taylor and Michael Clarke Duncan as the heads of the D.E.B.S. program, and Geoff Shults as Bobby, Amy's ex-boyfriend who doesn't quite get the ""ex"" part.

The DVD picture and sound quality are excellent.  There is a decent selection of extras, including 1) a few deleted or extended scenes, 2) a pair of commentaries, one from both director/writer/editor Angela Robinson, and the other from the main actresses (Devon Aoki excepted), 3) a music video of The Weekend's ""Into the Morning,"" which is the end title theme, 4) a short ""making-of"" featurette, and 5) a few odds and ends concerning the origins of the film in a comic strip conceived of by Robinson while she was in film school.  The one glaring omission is the previously mentioned 2003 short (maybe there were some copyright considerations involved as otherwise, including it would be pretty obvious).

If you want to watch a cinema classic, D.E.B.S. is not the film for you.  But if you simply want an entertaining 90 minutes, and to end up with a smile on your face and feeling good inside, D.E.B.S. is likely to be more satisfying than many more-hyped films.  During 2005, prior to buying this DVD, I saw at least 5 or 6 big-budget action films in the theater.  There's only one of them I'm likely to buy on DVD, and none of them--Batman Begins, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Fantastic Four and The Island among them--that was more enjoyable to watch than D.E.B.S.",1126656000,15,5114,4.915017462165308

This movie is definitely something you can see again and again over time.

The only thing that was a shame is that the original ""short"" is not on the DVD, and the cast commentary is rather weak.

One is the cool expression from characters played by Jordana Brewster, Meagan Good, Devon Aoki, and Holland Taylor. The other is the hilarious expression from characters played by Sara Foster, Jill Ritchie, and Jimi Simpson.

It's stunningly funny and very entertaining. I can feel a persistent smile on my face.

A great start for sequel, and good choices of team members. Imagine the 2 lovely on-screen couples continue their adventure with the friends, perhaps in Barcelona. That would have been great. Diversity is good, it's what the reality is.

The 90-minute length commentary is a marvelous idea. We can get to know how the girls work with each other in the film making efforts, and what they feel about each scene.",1125360000,4,1041,4.798882681564246

And no, I'm not saying that as the typical guy thing watching two hot girls kissing.  I'm saying that as the movie buff with an extremely open mind who found the relationship that builds throughout the movie as very convincing and extremely charming.

Sarah Foster and Jordana Brewster were great in the movie.  Jordana looked amazing in this movie and she pulled off playing the evil yet loving mastermind who can hold countries hostage but can't figure out what to say on a date perfectly.  And Sarah played her growing role sloughing through her confusion extremely well as well, down to the very end.

What makes a good spy?  According to the movie the most important is the ability to lie and this movie tells us that we tend to lie to ourselves in order to live the life everyone thinks we should live.  If you learn anything watching this movie it's for you to learn who you are.

Now if you're thinking ""why should I bother seeing this movie?"" all I can say is that if you can go into a movie having no expectations and willing to have fun with it you will really enjoy this movie.  I highly recommend it and if you're like me you'll wind up writing a review for it while watching it for the 2nd time.

Lucy and Amy (Jordana and Sara) make a beautiful and believable couple, the interaction between them is wonderful (as well as with the rest of the cast) both on and off camera and, even though some people could find it a bit corny, there HAS to be something seriously wrong with whoever sees this movie and doesn't end up smiling.

Overall, this is an extraordinary little piece of work, Angela rules, the casting was spot on and if your looking to have a very good time watching a heartwarming love story with a happy ending -that just happens to be a queer film that ACTUALLY portraits being a lesbian as NOT such an end-of-the-wold big deal- well then do yourself a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE...do not let the critics form a preconceived idea in your head about this film, just walk in with an open mind and willing to have a good time and make your own desicion about it, just think for yourself!....^_^",1123545600,10,1118,4.59

The whole idea seems absurd so of course I wasn't shocked to find that it was campy. I had heard that there was a kissing scene with two women but I didn't think much of it at all. As it turns out, the movie is much less about spies than it is about the relationship between these two women. Now, yes, hold onto your seat. You have campy action and humor and a lesbian relationship in this movie. Already you can see this isn't likely to be an oscar winning piece. Still, it's charming! The movie never really takes itself seriously at all and yet the message it sends out is a rather good one. No, I don't mean to say that everyone should go out and be gay....But being true to one's self IS something I would say everyone should do and that is really what is at the heart of this movie. I will say that I found Jordana and Sara delightful! They really made the movie for me. They were very very likeable and ultimately you have to have likeable characters. I didn't, however, care for the other D.E.B.S quite so much. They struck me as just a bit -too- uptight for even the writing's own good but over all I enjoyed it. Now I know four stars is a generous rating to give a film of this sort. On the other hand, you have to judge it based on what it was trying to accomplish and not what other movies might be better. The movie was meant to be fun, sweet and silly. The movie was meant to make us smile and think a little bit about acceptance and being true to yourself. Hey, high marks on all of those so--YES!

2260292,2,B0009298MU,"Once again, I have been led astray by girls in miniskirts.  I knew this was a pretty stupid comedy going in, but I had no idea just how utterly inane it really was.  I actually like a lot of stupid movies, but D.E.B.S. takes a whole lot of nothing on a long, boring ride to nowhere.  The script can only be a cry for help from a scriptwriter desperate to lose a job he detests, the cast members (with the exception of Jordana Brewster) are dreadful and put no heart whatsoever into what they are doing, and all the CGI hokum just makes the whole thing even more ridiculous than it already is.

The D.E.B.S. are a group of young female spies; girls who perform well on a secret test inside the SAT supply the candidates for this elite spy school - thus, they are not all paragons of virtue.  In the movie, our central gang of four young, ahem, ""heroes"" - consisting of an egomaniacal squad leader; a chain-smoking, bed-hopping French girl; an annoying goody-two-shoes still hoping to earn her stripes; and Miss Perfect Score herself, Amy Bradshaw (Sara Foster) the pride and joy of the organization - go after an infamous criminal mastermind named Lucy Diamond (Brewster).  Amy becomes the first agent to ever encounter Lucy and live to tell about it.  She doesn't really tell about it, however, because the fact is that she and Lucy are immediately infatuated with one another.  The majority of the movie consists of Amy struggling between her friends and her duty (which means bringing Diamond to justice) and her growing love for Lucy.  Batman capers are inserted to move the story forward (i.e., pass the time).  There are also some awkward attempts at comedy and a few bells and whistles to try and distract you from the utter inanity of the whole plot, but nothing really works.  Other than Amy finally making a decision in the end, that's really it in terms of the story.

Think about how bad the Charlie's Angels movies were.  Now multiply that badness quotient by about 100.  That's D.E.B.S. in a nutshell.",1123372800,2,2014,4.620786516853933

So curl up on your couch, poor the milk and enjoy spoonfuls of this sugary-sweet treat. -Cynthia Gunnells, CeleGAYtions",1122249600,,1034,4.625

2260306,5,B0009298MU,"The critics were all over the place on this film. Good, bad, good acting, bad acting, no plot, too much plot, too gimmicky. This generally makes my interest perk up.

The plot is simple, the acting is a little broad, some of the jokes work better than the others. At the core, though, this is a little romantic comedy that has a heck of a lot of heart. The central romance is presented in the perfect 90 minute formula that has you rooting for the couple to work it out.

Sure, it's a lesbian film, and maybe that's a gimmick. Maybe it wouldn't have worked without it. But who cares, if it works with it? The whole movie is just layer upon layer of preposterous notions, the lesbian angle is surely the most likely element of the plot. There are a lot of funny little bits and one liners. Jimmi Simpson is extraordinary. Jordana Brewster proves herself a skilled comic actor, especially when she has no lines but has to show us what she's thinking. The chemistry feels real, to me. There's even themes and ideas in it. Not real complicated ones, but a cut above the obvious ""be true to yourself"" which is also in there.

A couple of side notes. Watch the backgrounds: There's a lot of stuff that's obviously digitally inserted, and it's pretty much all packed full of weird little funny stuff. Also, in the speech scene at the end, look at the marquee inside. The soundtrack is a excellent, and very well used.",1121472000,7,1410,4.457364341085271
2260307,3,B0009298MU,"What a strange movie.  Originally, ""D.E.B.S."" was an 11-minute short written and directed by Angela Robinson (""Chickula: Teenage Vampire"") for the Sundance Film Festival in 2003.  Apparently that was basically a trailer for a faux television series that had teen schoolgirls as spies (sort of ""She Spies"" meets ""Head of the Class"" I guess).  The short was well received and a year later Robinson had turned her short into a featured film.  On that basis alone this film is worthy checking out, but unfortunately ""D.E.B.S."" the film is not as funny as I think it should be.  But it certainly sticks to its unique course and fidelity to an artistic vision is another rare thing to be cherished (as we are reminded every time a DVD offers us several alternative endings so that we can pick one we think actually makes sense).

Actually, ""D.E.B.S"" starts with a really neat premise.  You take the S.A.T. and buried in the test are questions that measure the ability to lie, cheat, steal and kill.  Get a high enough score and the government sends you off to D.E.B.S. school, run by by a publicity-seeking headmistress (Holland Taylor) who has trouble remembering the names of the girls.  Not that names particularly matter, because we are talking basic hottie stereotypes here: there is Max Brewer (Megan Good), the hot black one, Janet (Jill Ritchie), the cuet but shy white one, Dominique (Devon Aoki), the hot Asian one with the French accent who is always smoking, and Amy Bradshaw (Sara Foster), who is the smart white one and the D.E.B.S. poster girl because she got a perfect score on the aforementioned test.  You keep waiting for a great payoff to this perfect score idea and the whole S.A.T. testing bit, but it never really comes and the movie is too busy to go back and deal with those plot points.

The D.E.B.S. are the good girls (in more ways than one; do not expect any nudity in this film).  They wear school uniforms consisting of plaid skirts and ties with the usual white blouses.  The bad girl is raven haired Lucy Diamond (Jordana Brewster), who happens to be the subject of Amy's thesis.  The D.E.B.S. are spying on Lucy when she goes out on a semi-blind date with Ninotchka Kaprova (Jessica Cauffiel), a Russian assassin, and once the bullets start flying Amy and Lucy have a significant encounter.  The next thing we know, Lucy is seducing Amy.  Not to switch sides, but ""seducing"" like into bed.  This happens in James Bond movies all the time, so just imagine that James Bond is a teenage blond girl and go along for the ride.

There are some male characters running around in secondary roles, just to be foils for the ladies.  Bobby Matthews (Geoff Stults) tries to keep up with the D.E.B.S., while Mr. Phipps (Michael Clarke Duncan) provides them with a father figure, and Scud (Jimmi Simpson) is Lucy's right-hand man and the most interesting guy in the bunch.  For that matter Lucy is a lot more interesting that the D.E.B.S., individually or collectively.  The problem is that the idea behind the film is more interesting than its execution.  If there really is any satire in this film it is rather subtle, and that is not the way you want to go.  Then again, Angela Robinson ended up getting to direct ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" and you can drive yourself crazy trying to figure out if that was a reward or a punishment for what she did with ""D.E.B.S."", which is worth a look but not much more.",1121385600,,3419,4.671118530884808
2260308,4,B0009298MU,"Clever and Original

Angela Robinson (screenwriter and director) has put together a very entertaining film. ""D.E.B.S."" is clever and original. Unfortunately being clever and original in Hollywood means getting lousy distribution. So even though she has made her $4MM production look better technically than mega-expensive stuff like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", ""Taxi"", and ""Charlie's Angels"", you won't see it unless you buy or rent the DVD.

""D.E.B.S."" is not only technically better that its genre mates, it is a significantly superior story (i.e. not brain-dead and moronic) and actually incorporates moments of humor and charm.

But for a modest budget original film to get good distribution it must totally take off in the markets of its limited release. That ""D.E.B.S."" did not do so is attributable to Robinson's inexplicable casting decisions. Of the film's five actress she hits home runs with three: Meagan Good, Devon Aoki, and Jill Ritchie. Ritchie is especially good and pretty much steals all the scenes in which she appears.

But Robinson strikes out with her two other choices; Sara Foster and Jordana Brewster. While she manages to pretty much hide their acting deficiencies when the other characters are present to take up the slack, the two have a fair number of scenes together that are painful to watch. These scenes are simply awful and you find yourself wishing that Brewster's HUGE eyebrows will braid themselves into nooses and end our misery. It seems unlikely that Foster and Brewster could be so lacking in talent and still get work in the industry, so I will attribute at least part of the problem to the difficulty of playing these characters. At least their performances make the poor distribution issue less tragic.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1121040000,3,1788,5.068027210884353
2260309,3,B0009298MU,"Saw this film the other night and have to say that it is somewhat lacking. Somewhat lacking in originality, creativity, presentation, action and acting skills. I'm am sorry to say that two girls kissing just doesn't make up for what was missing in the film. The characters, well, I didn't really feel anything from them nor cared if anything happen to them. The action/acting was so mediocre that it just became dull. Maybe I'm just getting old. Nah",1120608000,,449,4.769230769230769
2260310,3,B0009298MU,"D.E.B.S is a paramilitary group that recruits young high school girls through SATs which secretly determines who qualifies to work as a spy for D.E.B.S. The four main characters of the film are Amy (Sara Foster), Janet (Jill Ritchie), Dominique (Devon Aoki), nad Max (Meagan Goode). They all work for D.E.B.S run by Michael Clarke Duncan and Holland Taylor. The girls' latest mission is to capture the notorious criminal Lucy Diamond (Jordana Brewster). The case becomes more complicated when Lucy and Amy develops an intimate relationship with each other which creates quite a bit of conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist.

I love films that are campy and over the top but D.E.B.S simply did not live up to its campy nature that it was supposed to be. It was really over the top. The performances by most of the actors were pretty mediocre. I did though like the relationship between Amy and Lucy. I liked the inner conflict that Amy was experiencing...to follow her heart or to continue to follow the orders of her bosses. One of the few good laughs I had in the film was when Lucy was lipsynching to Erasure's ""A Little Respect"" (my favorite Erasure song of all time). The soundtrack was good but I didn't think the mix of retro and modern music was a good combination. Still I did like all the songs, a lot more than I liked the film.",1120435200,,1352,4.656903765690377
2260311,1,B0009298MU,"What does a movie like ""D.E.B.S."" tell us about society? At first glance you might think not much, but if you just think about it it is very revealing in how far we have come to the roles women can play in movies.

 Think about it. How often have we been told if a woman were president there would be no wars? Women are against violence and war. They are more peaceful and gentle. Women in movies and society are generally seen as the victims and men the hunters. But look around you and you will start to notice people are starting to realize women are human beings and they too lie, steal, cheat, and kill. Watch ""Desperate Housewives"" or ""Sex in the City"". Women are being present in films and television as far more aggressive and assertive.

 But where does a movie like ""D.E.B.S."" stand in relation to all of this? It may in fact be helpful in the broad scheme of things, but as far as a movie goes it's pretty bad. I guess the basic idea here was to be a spy spoof, something along the lines of ""Charlie's Angels"" (yet another example of this recent trend of women's roles) and mix it up with a lesbian comedy.

 ""D.E.B.S."" are a secret group of spies that were chosen for their ability to lie. They are college students, all girls, who discovered that there is a secret test given on the S.A.T.'s that will determine if you are capable of being part of the group.

 The ""D.E.B.S."" biggest talent is Amy Bradshaw, she scored a perfect 100 on her test. But Amy is having personal problems. She doesn't know what she should do with her life. She doesn't want to be a spy. She is having problems with her boyfriend whom she just doesn't love. And then she is given an assignment. ""D.E.B.S"" must find Lucy Diamond (Jordana Brewster) a world famous villian.

 When Amy and Lucy meet, Amy was chasing after her trying to arrest her, they fall in love. Here is where the lesbian element comes in. Soon Amy is now put in a position of what to do. Should she stay loyal to the ""D.E.B.S."" or see if this is true love?

 The movie's biggest flaw with the movie for me was I just didn't care. I don't care about Amy or Lucy  or any of the other characters in this movie. They are broad stereotypes, which I suppose is what the movie wants them to be. But even so, they are boring to watch. I understand a movie such as this isn't going to dwell deep into these characters lives. That's fine. I understand there isn't going to be much of a personal involvment. But the movie could have at least done us the service of being funny. I didn't laugh once. The entire film seems brain dead. The dialogue is terrible, the acting second rate, the directing sloppy.

 If the movie's aim was to be a spoof us spy movies, you have to play it real. The movie knows that it is a comedy because nothing seems real. No one is playing this as if it were a reality. We know these characters do not exist. But if they were going to make fun of spy movies they should have played it real and let the situations speak for themselves. What I mean is have the situation be funny not having the characters know they are in a funny situation.

 But am I taking this movie too serious? I don't think so. I probably would have excused everything if only the movie had been funny. I'm sure there is an audience for this movie. And some day, if it doesn't already, it will have a cult status, but in the end the movie belongs to a club I simply don't want to be a member of.

 Bottom-line: Unbelieveably boring, brain dead movie that didn't make me laugh once. The movie knows it is a comedy and breaks any chance of us caring about what we are watching so instead we go along moment to moment waiting for this nightmare to end.",1120003200,6,3695,4.267908309455588
2260312,4,B0009298MU,"I liked this campy spy film with a lesbian twist but I wished that the storyline would have had much more physical (sexual) and emotional intimacy and interaction between the two female leads (the bad girl Lucy Diamond, played by Jordana Brewster, and good girl Amy, played by Sara Foster.)

In a nutshell, this film is about a secret spy agency called the DEBS (who all happen to be very beautiful girls in their early 20's.) DEB agents all over the world wear very short plaid skirts, carry very big guns, and look like Catholic school girls. Their mission is to fight the evil-doers of the world but somehow no blood ends up being spilled. One of the arch criminals that the DEBS have been after for years is Lucy Diamond, who has been lying low for several years. When the film opens, four of DEBS, including Amy (who is a dead ringer for a young Uma Thurman) learns that the dangerous and deadly Lucy Diamond is rendezvousing with an infamous Russian assassin and they are sent to capture them. The audience quickly learns that Lucy is not out to arrange an assassination or commit a crime but is instead looking for lesbian love in all the wrong places. The audience shortly thereafter learns that Amy has been fascinated by Lucy for a long time and is even writing a thesis on her. After the inevitable shoot out between the DEBS and Lucy, Amy and Lucy somehow end up alone with pistols aimed at each other. From the get-go, there is palatable sexual attraction between the two of them. The remainder of the film follows the smitten Lucy chasing after Amy, while Amy spends much of the film trying to deny her romantic and sexual feelings for Lucy, the bad girl. Classic storyline.

Again, I liked this film although it was very tame (meaning it had no gratuitous violence (no blood or guts), and especially NO explicit love scenes between Lucy and Amy.) In fact, the two gals only kissed a few times during this movie and this very much reminded me of one of those John Hughes movies from the 1980's, such as 16 Candles, Pretty in Pink, or Weird Science. If this film had a guy and gal kissing instead of two gals kissing, this film would have been rated G.

If Angela Robinson ever makes another film with the kind of funding she got for this film, I hope she actual puts real lesbian love scenes in the movie, something beyond a few kisses. As for DEBS, I so wanted to see a love scene between the gorgeous Amy and stunning Lucy and I'm bummed that I didn't see it in this one.

As an aside, I also also liked this film because the gal who plays Lucy Diamond looks a lot like my very first lover and it freaked me out and the shock of seeing someone who looked like my first makes this film a keeper to me :)",1120003200,12,2718,4.386904761904762

I found myself wishing there was an NC-17 rated version of this film with even more of their intimate moments together sans clothing!

2260314,4,B0009298MU,"When I first saw this movie (recommended by a friend) it was a bit mediocre for me.  However, after re-watching it a few times, I have truely grown to love this movie.

DEBS may be campy, corny, and a bit over the top, but it has a few underlying themes that many typical, one-time viewers won't catch on to.  The fact that this is the only lesbian/gay PG-13 film ever made says a lot.  And it's got an awesome, real-life ending.  There are so many movies that don't represent homosexual relationships as a whole.  In a lot of movies I have seen, there's always the girl dies or wasn't even gay to begin with kinda thing going on (i.e. Lost and Delirious, Head in the Clouds).  But DEBS portrays a normal lesbian relationship that people of all demographics can relate to.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is not Oscar-worthy by any means.  If any awards are to be given for this movie, it would be to Jordana and Sara (Lucy and Amy) for MTV's best Kiss of the Year and possibly to Angela Robinson (the director) for being so damn cool.  It's a lesbian, PG-13 movie that isn't stereo-typical...that says a lot in today's society.

It's a semi must-see for anyone, but I do think lesbians and straight men are going to be the audience that responds to the movie the most because...Jordana Brewster is simply hot in this movie.  Whew.

2260318,5,B0009298MU,"Glad to have seen the more positive reviews on this movie, I almost passed it up.  A PG13 rating helped, too.

How could anyone not like this movie.

The premise of the movie is a secret espionage agency that recruits high schoolers who score high on an SAT test that is secretly manipulated to show innate traits (or high probabililty) to lie, cheat, fight, or kill.

Four recruits have spent the last 4 years at James Morrison University, a rouse for espionage school.  Amy (Sara Foster), Max (Meagan Good), Janet (Jill Ritchie), and Dominique (Devon Aoki) are a squad and are assigned to spy on the master criminal Lucy Diamond (Jordana Brewster).

Lots of perspective in this gem of a movie.  Amy is writing a thesis on the elusive Lucy Diamond. When Amy finally comes face to face with her, all her assumptions are ""torpedoed."" Sensing an attraction, Lucy Diamond pursues Amy, when the conventional doesn't work, she resorts to creating events that bring Amy to her.  The name Lucy Diamond may invoke ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"": LSD (cultural drug used heavily in the 60's and 70's, during the civil rights struggle and the Vietnam war).  Amy says ""...love should be irresistible like a drug. When it happens, you're not able to help yourself..."" you want more.  Amy broke up with her boyfriend of 8 months and she reflected this thought when Lucy asked her why.

Many clever themes are barely under the surface in this movie.  Angela Robinson used not so obvious to point to the obvious, very clever indeed. One more example, Amy is the best spy ever recruited and is nicknamed the ""perfect score."" This information leads Amy to the truth when she discovers that she holds the perfect score for lying.  The espionage agency took the information to mean she is the perfect spy.

A bow to Angela Robinson for creating a unique story, sprinkling it with memories of Charlie's Angels, Mission Impossible, and I can't think of the other show there was a tinge of.  The cast is delightful, all-star. It is wonderful to see Holland Taylor (Ms. Petrie), Michael Clarde Duncan (Mr. Phipps), and Jordana Brewster (Lucy Diamond) who played the first ""Nicki Munson"" on the daytime soap ""As the World Turns.""

This story could go on forever.  It is young love at it's best as the song in the movie suggests:  ""It was young love at it's best and it is You that I'll remember.""  (song, Into the Morning, sung by The Weekend, the D.E.B.S soundtrack).
