5179101,5,B008R6BM2E,"Without giving away the progession of the plots I only wish to say I have enjoyed the ""Dynasty"" series all the way through from the first episode, wishing it would not end. The characters were generally despicable with ""Alexis"" as the supreme villian most of the time. The series is a constant battle between good and evil and I was struck that the ""Krystle"" character looked so much like Doris Day and ""Alexis"" like ""Cruella DeVille"".
The only problem is that the last episode just leaves you hanging . . . wanting more.
Well, the rest is up to your imagination.",1373587200,5,563,4.584158415841584

5179104,5,B008R6BM2E,"This was a great story. If you like sagas, you will love this. But, the ending seemed like it was not planned. It's as if they thought they were going to have another season. I felt like we were all left hanging at the end. That was disappointing, but overall, it was very entertaining.",1494892800,,286,4.314814814814815
5179105,3,B008R6BM2E,"After watching season 1-8 on prime like others stated  you have to buy season 9, seriously it's pretty dirty of amazon. Seriously, every character had no closure. Your left with WTH!!
 I'm gonna have to make up my own damn ending! Where Alexis wins again, Blake dies, Dex marries Sable, Fallon goes back to Jeff and finally Sammy finds true love. Adam takes over the company! Now I feel better! If you don't like my ending...make up your own",1487721600,,441,4.569620253164557

5179111,1,B008R6BM2E,Season 9 is the last season for this show and evidently they didn't know that because they live you with a cliff hanger like it will be on again for another season.  There is absolutely no closure.  Watched 9 seasons of this group of people sleeping with each other with very few new characters and then to leave you hanging on with no final ending on season 9 it was a complete let down.,1479340800,6,388,4.22972972972973

5179116,4,B008R6BM2E,"I'm really shocked and quite, honestly, disgusted that you, Amazon, would promote seasons 1-8 of Dynasty as an Amazon ""prime"" offering with no extra charge.  Then, once I'm hooked and I really want to see how the show ends, you start charging for season 9?  What a cheap shot and a greedy play on your customers.  Is this what you do with all of your Amazon video series programming?  Hook your customers and then blindside them with a fee towards the end of the series once they are hooked?  Think about how that looks.  I  would re-evaluate that strategy for additional profits.  It doesn't bode well with your customers and leaves a bad taste.
Otherwise, season 9 is getting better.  Finally, they are remembering Fallon's character and making her more like she used to be when Pamela Sue Martin played her.",1473465600,18,810,4.6879432624113475
5179117,2,B008R6BM2E,"Early Series started good and were interesting.  Towards the end series lost its quality, last season was terrible especially the way they ended the season was a bit crazy as if everyone in the very rich family had no sense.  Although series were canceled and did not come back last episode was seemed like a cheap movie with no ending.  John Forsythe, Joan Collins, Gordon Thomson were excellent for their characters.  This series is historic for Rock Hudson, his appearance in these series was towards end of his life.  In a nut shell, last season is not worth wasting time on.",1471824000,4,579,4.693069306930693

5179136,1,B008R6BM2E,"This final season is sooooo bad.  And not the good kind of bad.  The writing and acting are so awful that you wonder how the actors made it thru.  The budgets look like there were cut in half from previous seasons.  Gone are the opulent sets and over the top costumes, now, most of the women have discovered the ""softer side of Sears.""  The storylines are terrible.  Crystal has MORE headaches???!!!  We've come to expect more original and inventive antics for the Carringtons, but this season, they are ""yucking it up"" for laughs and rehashing old stories.  Jeff calling out ""Fallon"" while in bed with Sammy Jo is just ridiculous.  The ""John Travolta looking"" detective is practically out of Three Stooges with his shenanigans and dialog.  I am a ""completist"" and will force myself to watch the entire season, but it physically HURTS.",1459209600,5,835,4.776223776223776

I did not think that the story's ending was clear, nor did it tell us whether Alexis and Dex died.  I have tried to find out if there was an ending by searching to see if there was a Season 10. Also, Volumes 1 & 2 does not state if this is the ending of Dynasty. If anyone knows the answer please write it in the reviews which I intend to check.",1453593600,,517,4.049019607843137

I don't know why, but the actors that played Detective Zarelli and his police Captain irritated me no end....the actor in particular who played the Captain wasn't believable, and the detective's character just seemed out of place and distracting.

In any event, the story quality improves dramatically with Season 9 (a new writer-producer was brought in, even if it was too late to save the show from the axe). The muddled narrative and clunky execution that began in Season 3 and stumbled thru Season 8 has been arrested, and we're given an inspired, focused final season.

She brought special life into this ehow. I was rooting for Sable to take Alexis for everything she had. Nothing could thrill me more than to see Alexis have to absorb losing everything as Maria's reward for her being so evil and witchy. I hate Alexis. I do love the love story of Blame and Krystle. It is heaetfelt, dreamy, faithful, beguiling, romantic, and it helped me believe in love one more tkme. Sable is magnificient. She is gorgeous and has a compassuonate. It would have been nice to have seen her stick it to Alexis. Dex, Jeff, and Blake were a wonderful team of treasure saviors. Not too bad of the candy either. This is one of my favorite shows.

8530017,5,B008R6BM2E,"If I look at Dynasty as a whole series...the beginning was splashy yet topical; it was a rare piece of meat, so I look forward to when Joan Collins arrived as the carnivore who would sink her teeth into said meat and shake up the flesh. Season 2, with Alexis' entrance (and Sammy Jo), delivered. But once we got past that into a territory of poison walls and psychics looking for presumed dead gay sons, and a long lost Carrington almost every season, the show was in full fantasy mode, like it was written by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen. The show, from what I understand was given one more season (9) to deliver, so under the pen of Esensten and Brown and a new executive producer (in addition to Spelling), the show returned to it's original storytelling, but with a little more humility. I liked how the show delved into a rich group of characters (no pun) and tried to make ends meet with frayed continuity and character defects. This was more of a character driven season with all the featured cast finding redemption: Joan Collins' Alexis for one showing the dangerous side she strutted into court with before the show got too high off it's own caviar and champagne. I think this season is a closet favorite; some people think it's not interesting, but I think it relies on the strength of it's performers performing vs. being models for the latest clothes or hairstyle or advocating the latest vacation destination. I personally believed the show deserved a green light for one more season to tie up the loose ends after this earnest attempt...",1512777600,,1569,4.667870036101083

I relived my Dynasty Days thru Amazon but was bummed when Season 9 was only available via purchase.  Kind of forgot about it until recently and was happy to see I can finish the Series for free.  Thank you Amazon Prime.  I might have to check into Dallas or Knots to get my 80's fix on again.",1505347200,,418,4.175
8530019,4,B008R6BM2E,"I hate when I've watched NINE Seasons of a show and there's NO CLOSURE AT ALL! JUst like ""All My Children"" after 40+ years on the air they leave it with a cliffhanger! WHY?! I think 'Dynasty' didn't know Season 9 was their last, but THEN they have ""Dynasty:The Reunion"" which is worse than ANY Season! You'd think it'd b closure to Season 9 etc etc, nope. I feel like I've wasted A LOT of time! NINE SEASONS!",1503273600,2,408,4.243589743589744
8530020,4,B008R6BM2E,"After pretty sub par seasons 7 and 8, Dynasty gets it's groove back in what would be the final season. The best new catch this season is Stephanie Beacham is Sable Colby. She's all piss and vinegar and makes for a nice foil for Alexis. She arrived to the series after the spin-off show The Colbys was cancelled and provided a nice new friend for Blake after Crystal made an early exit. All in all the show is clearly past it's glory years, but it's nice to see everyone back in fighting shape for the final run.",1502755200,,511,4.278350515463917
