8086738,1,B000BHB132,"This is a review of the 2003 DVD ""A 4-STEP SYSTEM FOR SCREENING THE MARKETS: INTEGRATING TECHNICAL TIMING WITH FUNDAMENTAL INDICATORS FOR SUPERIOR STOCK SELECTION"" by Marc Gerstein. The running time is just under 90 minutes and because of the time constraint, Mr. Gerstein skipped over a large percent of his material.

The material that is presented is discussed only in general terms with  an occasional specific example from past history. The four steps are:

Step 1: Find  stocks worthy of further analysis

Step 2: Analyze each specific company

Step 3: Buy the best stocks

Step 4: Sell stocks that are no longer suitable

If you would like to know just HOW to make these decisions, you can buy a used copy of Mr. Gerstein's book, ""Screening the Market: A Four-Step Method to Find, Analyze, Buy and Sell Stocks"" for about the same price as this DVD, and the book will tell you what to do. This DVD doesn't tell you what to do, unless you count ""buy the book.""

My impression is that Mr. Gerstein's method uses fundamental analysis as a launchpad for technical analysis. The book has received positive reviews, and I will be adding it to my library.",1239235200,3,1154,4.701492537313433
