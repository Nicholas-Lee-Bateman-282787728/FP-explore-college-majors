8517480,1,B007IEDJKO,"They are both so similar; both have over-idealized fake made-up actors in usually glamorous artificial settings and often involved in a romantic quest. Who are these similar superficialities? Products of the Mexican and Hindi (Bollywood) romance film industry. They both have something else in common. They have a perpetually undereducated and impoverished audience seeking some assurance that the dream is alive for them. Thus the studios, producers, directors, actors, etc. have a continued source of income for their haciendas.

About the film. Unsatisfied (love & sex) family members spend some time at a beach resort with lots of film time devoted to doing nothing but lounging around the pool. Reminiscent of an afternoon Mexican TV soap opera production. Hurricane? Not sure why it's mentioned because it basically did nothing but fluff a few window curtains in the hotel.",1346284800,,879,5.369565217391305
