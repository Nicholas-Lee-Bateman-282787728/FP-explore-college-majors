7865683,5,6304247605,"Kavanagh Q.C. (Collection Set 1) [VHS]
this set has 4 vhs with movies on all tapes
I bought them all here on Amazon
I have all the DVDS and bought the vhs's for my daughter
she watches them while she cooks
I certainly recommend that any one who loved John Thaw in Inspector morse
buy these movies as it is an extention of his tallents
the world lost a great actor when he passed away.
do look here on Amazon for all of john thaws movies
you will not be disappointed in the least

7865684,4,6304247605,"What a joy to watch a first rate series!  John has thawed out a bit and seems a tad warmer and more accessable than his some of his other series characterizations although he never strays from being top notch. He is  throughly believable as the the middle aged barrister with the wife turned  career woman and almost adult children giving him pause to reflect and get  one's house in order.  The casting works to create a wonderful mix of  family, co-workers, rivals and villans.
The story lines are tight,  thought provoking and deserve a thumbs up for the twists, turns, and  ""rumbles"" that they take.  Always enjoyable to see a craft well  done.",954547200,18,648,4.654867256637168
