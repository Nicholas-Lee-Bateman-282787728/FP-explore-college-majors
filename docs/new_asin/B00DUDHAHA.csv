5855742,3,B00DUDHAHA,"It got pretty good things to learn and adapt after watching this. But as this one is video version  which runs for around 2 hrs , I was expecting to have more on diet options for people who have various kind of life styles coz everyone does not get homemade food cooked by mom . Here they shared lot of experiences of Rujuta's clients which are really inspiring. In all experience was good but it can be enhanced more.",1377216000,,418,4.291139240506329
5855743,3,B00DUDHAHA,"Hi DVD is good , but i had read her both the books i personally felt its more details on charts and all other stuff
For me it was mostly repetition of what i learn from books and her blogs and video's

I like use of ghee or the other example of filtered oil vs refine oil they are really helpful to understand.
 I appreciate the effort she is taking for making people's life easier healthy and enjoyable.

I think the DVD price $9 is not much worth to pay i would say go for book it will help you more

Keep up !! i wish i will see better version of movies in future

8597845,5,B00DUDHAHA,"I've watched this DVD a couple times and get something new out of it each time. It covers all aspects of eating from what/when/how and makes very good points in contrasting life experience to popular culture. Although it seems to me to be targeting women in India, this common sense approach to eating would make sense in everyone's life and I've tried to apply her principles in mine. I enjoyed the music, the scenery and listening to the interviewees. Even the extra material was interesting, especially Rujuta's mother.",1379721600,2,522,4.943181818181818
