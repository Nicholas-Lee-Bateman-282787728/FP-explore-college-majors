2832600,5,B000Q6GUSE,"""The Fugitive,"" has to be one of the best tv series.  It had the human element, adventure, a little bit of
everything.  David Janssen is brilliant as Doctor Kimble, and made the situations very believable.
Barry Morse was really great as Gerard and never out of character and determination to hunt down Kimble.
You just held your breath and hoped Kimble got as far away from Gerard as possible.
They definitely don't make shows like this anymore, and I am sure never will.  David Janssen, always, the gentleman, brought a kindness , inherit goodness and integrity, that is unmatched by any other character in television history.",1392163200,4,628,4.90566037735849

2832615,4,B000Q6GUSE,"I just finished watching Season 1, Volume 1 of the Fugitive. I have to give it four stars, which I think is a good review for such an old show. The dvd quality is quite good although at times the picture is grainy. In the scenes that used fake smoke and fog that old technique doesn't look real by today's standards, but it's all good. I am enjoying watching all of the old stars and minor soon to be bigger stars. I like the old cars, trucks, buses. The storyline is simplistic usually but David Janssen makes it work. He's a little too quite an too much of the GOOD GUY.  This same sort of travelling do gooder has been seen probably many times over the years. Bill Bixby as David Banner of the Incredible Hulk was another such wandering savior/do gooder. The packaging is rather weak, especially since they charge twice what many old shows would charge for one season. Perhaps restoration took place? Anyway, one retainer for disc FOUR has already busted for volume one. These cheap cd cases are just the latest CRAP that the big corporations are pushing on to the public. But check out this show. It is entertaining, if not always riveting.",1324598400,,1144,4.5

2832620,5,B000Q6GUSE,"All in all a great Series!
Read my comments regarding this Series and then go on You Tube Videos and type:
The Fugitive 1963. The REAL Pilot Episode. A condensed version.  Plus Clips.
Watch this movie on TV via HDMI on your laptop.  it's brilliant.
Apologies for poor quality.
Here we go!
I watched the REAL Pilot Episode the week before  Fear In A Desert City was first aired in 1963!  (I was 22 years old at the time).
I swear to God this is true. I am not lying. Why would I? What would be the point in doing so?
I have joined and edited segments together(14 minutes in total) in their correct order to make a proper movie showing the truth regarding this matter.
(Who's a clever boy, then?).
These segments were taken from The Girl From Little Egypt. Season 1. Episode 14.
These segments themselves were taken from The REAL Pilot Episode and should very much suggest to you that there was, indeed, an earlier story in existence.
Assume, as everybody does, this REAL Pilot Episode doesn't exist.
RIGHT!
So.
It's taken until Episode 14 to find out ANYTHING about Kimble's life before his wife was murdered!
Hey!  Thanks a lot, QM Productions!
We find out NOW that his wife's name was Helen!
We find out NOW that his son was stillborn!
We find out NOW that his wife had started drinking!
We find out NOW that they had started having arguments about adoption!
All this has taken 14 Episodes before we find this out!
This Episode or a similar storyline would have been much better to have started the Series with, wouldn't it?
What on earth was the matter with you lot at Q M Productions?
Well, nothing. Nothing at all!
They did a great job with this! The true fact being that this Pilot Episode went missing!
There are two crucial points here.
a)  Q M Productions were not aware that this Episode was never included in the Series after they sold it.
b)  CBS Paramount  were never aware that it ever existed in the first place.
Both companies.
NOT GUILTY.
This old tape is still languishing in an old film can in the Archives /Basement of a TV Network Station or a collectors shed/outhouse or attic somewhere.
CBS Paramount you are sitting on a goldmine here.
Find this Episode and re-issue Season 1 volume 1 as a Special Edition with the Wanted Poster as the artwork. (Tug of War. Season 2. Vol 1. Episode 7).
Please Do NOT print anything fancy about finding this Episode on the front  cover artwork!
Either print it on the back or just put it on your Product information regarding 'Special Edition'.
Think of what the customer would like to look at on the cover and NOT just yourselves trying to drum up sales!
That won't be needed, I assure you.
Also please don't do this Manufactured DVD-R  on demand cheap rubbish. Quality DVD please.
Be proud of yourselves.
Please re-issue the whole Series as Region Free for those living in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. You are absolutely no help at all with this at the present time, are you?
Now THAT would drum up your sales!
So come on and hunt him down.
He is a fugitive, after all !

2832621,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I bought this as a ""just because"" gift for my father. He said that it was his favorite show when he was a teenager. I'm only 21 so I obviously had never seen it before. After watching the first season (first and second volumes) I can honestly say that this is one of the best shows EVER. Albeit in black and white and the lack of the special effects that we all love and know now..what it lacks in the modernization of television it makes up for it in, most importantly, CONTENT! I love the will of Richard Kimble and the intensity of Girard. It's great storytelling and I look forward to owning the rest of the series! Season 4 can't come fast enough!

And for everyone else who don't like the Fugitive.. you can go back to your gems like ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" and ""Holly's World""",1279238400,3,793,4.322147651006712
2832622,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I dropped by my local library and picked up Volume One of Season One of the television program The Fugitive.  I had seen the Harrison Ford film but what was the television show about?

It aired on ABC ((ABC, 120 episodes from 17 September 1963 - 29 August 1967, about a man (Kimble, played by David Jansen) falsely accused of murdering his wife, and yet he is found guilty and is on his way to death row.  A train accident allows him to break free.

On the run, the detective who let him go chases Kimble across the country to put him back in jail.  Kimble however is looking for the real killer, whom he believes is a one-armed man he saw leave Kimble's residence upon the discovery of his wife's murder.

As with most TV shows, this prelude is at the beginning of each program.  It's a Quinn Martin production.  I love Quinn Martin shows such as The Invaders, etc.

The Fugitive is a compelling drama, that at times leaves you emotionally drained, as your sympathy for the characters is quite high.  The high quality of writing and direction is some of the best of Sixties TV.

In gorgeous black & white, the episodes featured some of my favorite actors from the Sixties.

The two parter in the first cut had Susan Oliver and Robert Duvall!  It was great seeing these actors in early parts.  Susan had later played the green dancer in the pilot Star Trek episode.  Robert of course has had many large roles including the film Apocalypse Now.

Another tale had Alejandro Rey (from The Flying Nun!) as part of a migrant farm worker crew who all hated Kimble, suspecting him of being with the border patrol.

In all these and other episodes, he at times may have to reveal he is a surgeon.  He knows that if the detective gets wind of it, the hunt will be on.  A careless match left with the name of the place Kimble worked at.  An errant radio story about a farm worker who suddenly performed surgery because he was a doctor.

One interesting episode actually had the detective almost die in a sea accident and ironically, Kimble had to save his life.  After saving the detective's life, of course the chase would be on.

It was good to see Barry Morse as the obsessed detective.  I recall him being one of the main cast members in Space:1999.

Anyway, this is an exciting show.  Each episode creates a scenario where Kimble either almost finds who the one-armed man is, or he is forced to use his medical skill to help others, or he is almost found out and is back on the run.

Recommended as a great example of excellently produced television.  The series lasted five seasons on CBS, 1963 to 1967.  A remake was attempted  in 1993 but only lasted one season.",1276300800,2,2660,4.43595041322314
2832623,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The Fugitive Season 1 Volume 1 is the first 15 episodes of the classic television series. All 15 black and white episodes translate beautifully to dvd, and all have the great Pete Rugolo score completely intact. Featuring the incredible David Janssen as the wrongly convicted Dr. Richard Kimble, Barry Morse as the relentless Lt. Gerard, the show also has a who's who of guest stars, including Brian Keith, Vera Miles, and Telly Savales. The Fugitive Season One Volume 1 brings back a classic which has truly stood the test of time.",1266796800,3,532,4.857142857142857
2832624,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Felt so sorry for Dr Kimble.  Each week he'd find friends, establish relationships, hook up with hot chicks...& then along would come Lt Girard and he'd have to high-tail it.  The late, great David Janssen...PERFECT for the role.  I later purchased season 1, vol 2 & season 2, vol 1.

Watching brought back such great memories & it was cool seeing the then 'newcomer' actors/actresses who later became huge stars.  Highly recommended!",1265760000,2,434,4.972222222222222
2832625,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The Fugitive revolves around Dr. Richard Kimble and his flight from the law, after he's wrongfully convicted of killing his wife. Kimble tells the authorities that he saw a one-armed man fleeing the scene, after discovering his wife's dead body in his living room. Problem is, Kimble could never prove that he didn't kill his wife, before being sentenced to death by execution.

Things look grim for Dr. Kimble, when he's in the custody of Lt. Phillip Gerard after his conviction, and on his way via train to being executed. The hand of fate steps in, however. Kimble manages to escape from Lt. Gerard's custody, after the train transporting them wrecks. From that moment on, Dr. Kimble must run for his life, traveling from town to town. Whenever Kimble arrives in a new place, he must assume a whole new identity, to keep from getting caught by Lt. Gerard.

Kimble can never rest easy for long, since Lt. Gerard is always in piping-hot pursuit of Kimble. Gerard makes it his personal mission in life to capture Dr. Kimble, and have him executed, despite the fact that Kimble is innocent. And Gerard is unwilling to accept that Kimble's wife might have been killed by the one-armed man, despite Kimble's insistence that he's innocent of murdering his wife.

While keeping one step ahead of Gerard, Dr. Kimble is also hunting for the one-armed man, in hopes of capturing him. If successful, Kimble then has a chance of being able to prove that the one-armed man was his wife's murderer. Kimble knows that getting the one-armed man, is his only hope of proving his innocence.

David Janssen does a splendid job, in his portrayal of the painfully desperate, besieged Dr. Kimble. Barry Morse also gives an excellent performance, as Lt. Gerard. Barry does great at conveying Lt. Gerard's almost pathological obsession, with capturing Dr. Kimble. I also thought that the narration at the start and end of very episode by actor William Conrad, was a nice touch.

Over the years, there have been many 'chase' dramas on TV, including The Pretender, The Immortal, The Prisoner, etc. These were all good shows. But none of them could match the gripping, nail-biting suspense of The Fugitive. It's now on DVD, and I highly recommend giving it a look, if you haven't yet. Once you do, you'll be hooked on this drama series.",1262044800,,2311,4.811083123425693

Great show, top quality official DVD.  Of course, I wish they didn't split the seasons, but what can you do...  I'm looking forward to the rest of the series, but am a bit concerned about Season Two as I'm not sure if replacement discs are still available as much of the music has been changed from the original.",1262044800,,479,4.348314606741573

I will enjoy this DVD many times and may order other seasons of The Fugitive.",1261526400,,326,3.739130434782609
2832628,5,B000Q6GUSE,I can remember when The Fugitive was THE show that everyone was talking about.  The new episodes were on at night and they were already showing rerun episodes in the afternoon. These first season episodes really set the groundwork for all that followed. David Janssen's portrayal of Dr. Richard Kimble was always moving. He projected a sadness and determination that really brought the character to life.  Watching this early episodes served to remind me not only of what a great show this was but also what a great actor we lost when David Janssen passed away.,1256342400,,561,4.833333333333333

2832632,5,B000Q6GUSE,"What a great flashback into the past!  The USA was obsessed with the Fugitive during the 60s.  One could not afford to miss Dr. Richard Kimble in each weekly episode, even more so than Jack Bauer in 24 today.  For four seasons, 120 episodes in all, we hoped that Richard Kimble would find the one-armed man that killed his wife, before Lt. Gerard would capture him.  Look at the many souls he helped along the way!

Part two of the August 1967 finale still holds one TV record that has never been broken.  The final episode in 1967 was watched by a phenomenal 72 percent of American homes with television sets at that time!  While both the final episode of MASH in 1983 and the 1980 ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas had more viewers in sheer numbers,  the final hour of the Fugitive retains the record for the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a TV finale.

Two episodes you cannot miss are The Girl from Little Egypt, which recounts the events of that fateful night when Mrs. Kimble was murdered, and Home is the Hunted, when Dr. Kimble goes home to Indiana to see his family.

Television was still a positive influence on our culture in the 1960s, emphasizing moral values.

All 30 Season One episodes (1963-1964) are on two DVDs.  I hope they will eventually release all four seasons in the original format.",1237248000,4,1335,4.539748953974895
2832633,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The Fugitive had, for the most part, great scripts and directors who contributed mightily to the show's quality (the show slipped somewhat in it's last season due to the departure of producer Alan Armer). However, what really made this show special was the presence of David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble. At the same time actors like Adam West and William Shatner were over-emoting and hamming their way into infamy, Janssen conveyed his emotions and feelings with subtle facial expressions and through his eyes. This technique played perfectly into the nature of the character -- a person who had to be guarded and cautious 24 hours a day so as not to give away his true indentity. Janssen was the only acting constant on The Fugitive (Barry Morse appeared in less than half of the episodes and Bill Raisch -- the one armed man -- barely appeared at all before he presence was increased for the fourth and final season) and was in almost every scene of every episode. It's no wonder Janssen was relieved when the series ended in 1967.

David Janssen never really reached the heights he achieved during the run of The Fugitive. He was never out of demand, to be sure. He starred in other TV series (O'Hara, US Treasury, Harry O) and made many theatrical and TV movies (the underrated Warning Shot, The Green Berets, Marooned, Two Minute Warning, etc.). However, The Fugitive was (and will always be) the crowning achievement of his career. It's sad that Janssen died so young -- he was such a good actor that it's likely that he could have been cast in a role that would have given him the recognition he deserved.

The plots are gripping, the scripts are products of intelligent design, and the acting is some of the best the viewer will see from many very familiar faces.  I just finished volume two of season one and the quality is consistent from beginning to end.  There are no extras (no interviews - -no suprise, the key players have been dead for years).  So what.  The real meat is well done.  The transfer of sound and picture to DVD is crisp and clean and that's what really counts.  I can't wait for season two.",1211846400,2,563,4.41747572815534
2832637,5,B000Q6GUSE,"You already know that The Fugitive is the greatest dramatic TV series of all time and an absolute must-own on DVD.  You also know that it stinks that the show is being released in half season sets instead of full season sets.  But, did you know that the Fugitive discs come packaged in one of the most poorly designed DVD cases in history?

In an effort to save shelf space, the environment, or perhaps both, all four Fuge DVDs come to you crammed into a single plastic ""keepcase"" (a misnomer, as this case is not worth keeping).  Disc 1 is on one side, disc 4 is on the other, and discs 2 and 3 are on a hinged flap in the middle.  When I received my first Fuge set via UPS, I heard the sickening sound of rattling bits of hard plastic before I even opened it up, despite the fact that there was no visible damage to the exterior of the case, or to the Amazon box the set was shipped in.  I soon learned that the rattling was due to the fact that virtually all of the tiny plastic tabs that hold discs 1 and 4 were broken clean off and the DVDs were on the loose, much like Dr. Richard Kimble.  I assumed this was an anomaly, so I wrote to the nice folks at Amazon and they very speedily sent a replacement.  Well, as you've probably already guessed, the replacement set was no different than the original.  Ergo, I either have the worst luck in the world (which is probably true) or most--if not all--Fugitive Season One Volume One sets come in broken cases.

The moral of my boring story is: if you want The Fugitive on DVD, but you don't want the discs to fall to the floor every time you open the case, you'll need to buy some&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/spare/dp/B0001MKU48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">spare</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/cases/dp/B0009EVYUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">cases</a>&nbsp;to store your Fuge discs in.  5 stars for Dr. Kimble, ZERO stars for Paramount's ridiculously fragile cases.",1208822400,7,2009,4.931750741839763
2832638,5,B000Q6GUSE,"""THE FUGITIVE"" premiered in 1963 and was canceled in 1967. The series had a total of four seasons and 120 episodes. David Janssen was Dr. Richard Kimble.
One night at his home, Kimble and his wife had an argument. He ran out of the house to drive around and cool off, but when he returned, he almost ran over a one-armed man not far from his house. He parked the car, and went inside. He found his living room a mess, and his murdered wife's body on the floor. Richard almost instantly suspects the suspicious one-armed man. However, as it always is with these type of tragedies, the doctor has nothing at all to prove his alibi. None of his neighbors heard Kimble leave or return. The local police investigate, but no evidence is found to support Kimble's story. A search is conducted for a one-armed man. Many are found, but none of them are the right one. So he is tried and wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife. But Kimble does not hold anything against any of them. As the narrator William Conrad said at the beginning of each episode, "" Laws are made by men and carried out by men. And men are imperfect."" On the way to state prison, the train derails, and Kimble escapes. He is almost immediately pursued by the determined detective, Lt. Philip Gerard.
Gerard holds nothing personal towards Kimble. The law found him guilty, and he enforces the law. It is asked of Gerard many times throughout the series if he believes Kimble to be guilty. The lieutenant never gives a direct answer, so the audience assumes that he is only doing it because it is his job. For the show's entire run on the ABC Network, Kimble would endlessly travel across country, town after town, job after job, and alias after alias. It seemed like it would never end for this hunted man. As Kimble is being hunted, he is also hunting. He is searching for the one-armed man that murdered his wife. An interesting thing about this show was its amazing dedication to the average citizen, and how they live. Kimble would often have to give up a chance to get away in order to save the life of an innocent bystander. Often, when Richard would escape, he would not be escaping from Gerard. He would be running from the locals of a certain town that say he raped a woman, or caused a fight. Richard would be forced to use fake names and identities so he could get a job. He was always hoping to settle down somewhere, and be able to stop running. But Gerard would never give up. Finally, in the series finale, ""The Judgment"", it all comes full circle. I will not give away any specific details, but I will say that the last episode was one of the best episodes of the show, and it was also the highest rated episode in the history of television until the episode called ""Who Shot J.R.?"" of the popular soap opera ""DALLAS"". ""The Fugitive"" was one of the best shows of its kind, and it still is. Below is a list of episodes contained in this 4-disc set.

2832639,5,B000Q6GUSE,This is a must for everyone who loves old black and white TV serials.  David Janssen was excellent in that role.,1205539200,2,112,4.333333333333333
2832640,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The 120 episodes (90 in B&W, 30 in Color) of the television drama ""The Fugitive"" originally ran from 1963-1967 on ABC. The broadcast of the final episodes in August 1967 was a national event.

Most likely anyone reading this already knows the perfect premise of the series. The producers took Dr. Sam Sheppard's long running Cleveland murder trial and blended it with Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables"". The title character was renamed Dr. Richard Kimble (played by David Janssen who would later star in the detective series ""Harry O"") and the series began an argument between Kimble and his wife Helen over adopting a child. He storms out of the house showcasing his fury to their neighbors. Upon returning home Kimble sees a one- armed man fleeing the Kimble house. Inside the house he finds the body of his wife.

Kimble is tried and convicted, the one-armed man does not come forward and no one believes Kimble's account of that evening. When the train taking Kimble to prison derails he escapes from the custody of Indiana State Police Lt. Phillip Gerard (Barry Morse).

This begins parallel chases as Kimble pursues the as yet unidentified one-armed man (Bill Raisch) and Gerard becomes obsessed with recapturing Kimble. The beauty of the premise was the total flexibility it allowed the writers with regard to each episodes story and the ease of incorporating legitimate action, tension, and drama.

The series was a Quinn Martin Production (with the same high quality production value as his other television series: ""The Invaders"", ""The Untouchables"", ""The F.B.I"", ""The Streets of San Francisco""). Each episode was broken into four acts and they went out with an epilogue- William (""Cannon"") Conrad doing the narration. Janssen is excellent in the role and delivers a subtle non-verbal performance consistent with a man on the run who must be extremely reserved to avoid attracting attention.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1205193600,5,1944,5.043613707165109
2832641,3,B000Q6GUSE,"Like most of you, I was happy to see a great series finally come out on DVD...but really annoyed with this continuing practice some studios have of splitting seasons into two Box Sets just to squeeze more money out of you and me.  If the Wild Wild West can come out in a single season box set and the studio still makes a decent buck on it, so can the Fugitive and the rest of the others that have been issued in split seasons.  While we all want to get it, until we stop knuckling under and giving in to these thieves, they will continue to do it to us and we have no one to blame for it but ourselves.",1204675200,6,603,3.975206611570248
2832642,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Hey guys, I think both you and CBS are thinking along the same lines--let 'em languish! Why am I not suprised-- you're the same company. Look, let's be a little more customer friendly, release volume three with the whole season. Whata' ya' say? This is a great show and it's difficult to wait. And another thing: I'm going to retire in a few years and I won't have time to watch TV! Okay, so I've waited since 1967; maybe I can wait a few more years (maybe); however, please remember: I ain't get'en any younger ya' know. Incidentally, the word fugitive comes from the Latin ""fuge"" to fly or flee fast. So, please make with the next season--fuge. Oh, one last thing: Perry Mason too.",1204416000,,683,4.472
2832643,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The Fugitive Season One Volume One is absolutely Fantastic. The writers ,directors,Scene decorators or art people  were the greatest ever. Peter Rugolo's Music absolutely rounds out this most professionaly made  drama. The tv shows of today ,sadly ,pale in comparison to  the Fugitive. The guest actors and actresses are worth buying it and seeing it just for that reason alone. My favorite episode is ""Nightmare  At North Oak"" Guest starring Nancy Wickwire a beautiful woman who passed away in 1974 at 49 years old of cancer. Frank Overton reprises his role as sheriff in to Kill a Mockingbird again in this episode and was excellent. This is a must have for those really serious  fans of television drama that are dissappointed with todays tv fare. God Bless David Janssen and yes william conrad for such a great job of Narrating the episodes. Willam conrad also played  the chief inspector on ""Jake and the fat man"".

2832644,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The episodes look superb, and seem a good 5 minutes longer than reruns edited for syndication.

2832646,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The Fugitive was one of those rare programs that kept viewers coming back every week. We all knew the one-armed man would never be found until the series came to an end, but we watched anyway. What a great show! I just hope the entire series is released.",1197158400,,254,4.3125
2832647,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Until a 14 year old actress made poignant vulnerability her own in her so-called life, David Janssen's Richard Kimble had that crown for 3 decades, in a role that defined his career. Great writing, casting, and a character you not just rooted for, but ached with throughout his travails. It had heart galore and touched anyone not made of solid stone. Unlike its teen successor, this show was not ignored. The ballyhooed series finale was THE highest rated TV for an astonishing 10 years. Maybe it was the fact that Janssen looked and was in pain most of the series from a bad back or that he took nervous fidgiting to Shakepearean levels, but his Dr. Kimble was one of those lightning-in-a-bottle confluences that happens only a few times during a lifetime of viewing. Blame the Quinn-Martin estate for hoarding the series, releasing it only a few years long ago for limited daytime syndication. (I had most of the series on VHS from those runs.) At last they finally let it go like a precious family heirloom. Better 40 years than never. It deserves perhaps a bit more fanfare and flourishes  for such a popular series, but at least it's out there now for new generations to discover and take to heart. RIP DJ. There's also a more detailed episode and series guide - ""THE FUGITIVE RECAPTURED: THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY COMPANION"".",1195776000,3,1327,4.744588744588745
2832648,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Simply the best--Excellent quality.  Also, The Fugitive is one of the best three drama series ever made for T.V.--right along side The Shield and The Sopranos.  Look forward to future volumes being released sooner than later.",1194739200,3,225,5.222222222222222
2832649,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Nothing on TV today can compare to this classic.  Although it is regretful that greed has caused this to be released in two stages, I have no choice but to become a victim.",1194048000,2,172,4.212121212121212
2832650,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I have been waiting for the original 'The Fugitive' to come out on DVD.  I have enjoyed it very much. Hope you have plans for Seasons 2, 3 and 4 on DVD as I would certainly buy them.",1193788800,4,182,3.789473684210526
2832651,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Like so many who regularly peruse this space looking for old gems I was delighted to see The Fugitive finally get a quality release.  It looks and sounds better than ever, and as many have already commented it is a true TV classic from an era where quality was king.  I have been a David Janssen fan for more years than I care to remember, although I have never been able to put my finger on exactly why.  Yes, he was a fine actor who underplayed with great power, but it's more than that.  His portrayal of Kimble is a study in despair and melancholy.  More than any other actor he seemed to personify world weariness.  Harry O was his other classic which we can but hope that Warner Brothers see fit to release in similar style.  Finally on the subject of The Fugitive, lets here it for Barry Morse!  What a great actor and by all accounts a very nice chap too.  I was delighted and surprised to read a few months ago that he was born in the East End of London, bless `im.  If you too are a fan, buy the box set of the ITC series The Adventurer if only to hear him reminisce about how he handled working with Gene Barry.  Highly amusing!

One last thing: If you ever get the chance to see the 1970 TV movie Night Chase you will see David Janssen at his best.  It is basically a two-hander with the wonderful Yaphet Kotto.  Night Chase has been released on DVD as LA Cab, but I would urge you to avoid this rather tatty version.  The quality is dire and it has been cut.

Anyway, nice to know there are other Janssen fans out there; let's hope the other 107 episodes of The Fugitive are released (with some commentaries by Barry Morse please) ASAP!",1193702400,4,1649,4.220447284345048
2832652,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I was hooked on this series (the finest ever to be broadcast on television) from the very beginning.  What really hurts is that, that beginning was 44 YEARS AGO!  Anyway, all things good to say about The Fugitive and Janssen, Morse & Company have probably already been written, sooo, I'll just say that if you liked the series, buy the DVD (and pray that Paramount follows up with the other 7 volumes, PRONTO!)  AND if you've never seen/heard of the original series then you've got a real treat in store when you buy the DVD and watch a show that beats the pants off of anything comtemporary television has to offer.

The audio/video quality is excellent and I'm sure the picture I'm watching now is much better then when I viewed the original broadcast on my old Crosley V, B/W television set.  And for those folks who lament that the show lost something when it went to color in 1966-67, JUST TURN OFF THE COLOR SETTING ON YOUR TV AND WATCH THE FINAL SEASON IN B/W.",1193529600,4,967,4.471590909090909

2832657,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Like many others I say, ""It's about time!"" I thoroughly enjoyed watching these 15 episodes. David Janssen was an underrated actor & I really couldn't think of another actor who could've done this role as well as he did. Well written, well crafted & well directed. The quality of the dvd is very good but it has no extras, i.e., no subtitles, no bonus features, etc. It's simply a no frills edition. Buy this, you won't be disappointed",1192492800,3,434,4.576923076923077
2832658,5,B000Q6GUSE,"David Janssen was one of TV's greatest actors.  The Fugitive was an engrossing series with a high concept:  the escape of an innocent man and his pursuit by a relentless investigator (Barry Morse).  Each week Janssen's Dr. Richard Kimball had to establish a new identity just to earn enough money to survive.  His poise and education often made him an object of suspicion--why was this man toiling as a migrant farm worker or a dock worker?  Jansen was understated and strong.  Due to the political climate of its day, his three years' worth of Emmy nominations never resulted in a win.  He was robbed.  Now audiences who fondly remember this classic series can relive the drama.  Even the opening credits narrated by actor William Conrad are memorable.",1192233600,5,753,4.866141732283465
2832659,4,B000Q6GUSE,"With elements taken from Victor Hugo's Les Miserable, a man is pursued, with almost obsessive and compulsive determination by a Police Lt. who will stop at nothing to find and recapture his quarry.  Even his superior, Captain Carpenter (Paul Burke) is both confused and seriously concerned that Gerard's single-minded fixation is doing him more harm than good.  Dr. Kimble was arrested, convicted and sentenced to death for murdering his wife.  The problem for Kimble is simply this.... he didn't do it.  From week to week the fugitive, ever on the hopeful-alert of finding the one-armed man, is forced to keep moving, find odd jobs, color his hair, change his name, and inevitably interact with dozens of people he meets (people played by dozens of upcoming stars seen in the earliest of acting roles, like Telly Savalas, Vera Miles, Robert Duvall and many others) while doing all he can to avoid being noticed by the police.  The seemingly-endless, nerve-jangling game of hide and seek between Kimble and Gerard was palpable.  David Janssen played Kimble about as well as anyone possibly could.  Barry Morse was equally credible as the cold and calculating Philip Gerard.  My late father just loved this series, and as I watch the episodes, as I imagine he would see them, I can understand WHY he loved and enjoyed it so.  In the end, after years of running, years of looking behind himself, trying to stay at least one step ahead of his relentless tracker, Kimble finally gets his face to face with the one-armed man and the justice he has struggled so hard to obtain.  At that point, we all get that long-overdue sigh of relief.  Whew!!
This series was just outstanding by virtually every facet of measurement. You could do a lot worse than to buy this series, settle down with your loved ones and some popcorn, and follow the weekly adventures of an innocent man, running and running and....",1191628800,3,1896,4.8390092879256965
2832660,5,B000Q6GUSE,"The Fugitive (on paper) was always a predictable bore. Every single episode ran the same;

1. Kimble is in a new place, with a new job
2. Kimble helps someone find happpiness/peace/refuge
3. Kimble finds himself in a very tricky situation
4. Kimble escapes by the skin of his teeth

the joy and genius of this incredible TV show is that although you know exactly what's going to happen, it's still exciting and watchable. The whole 129 episodes !  In my opinion, its still the very best U.S TV series ever made and years ahead of its time. An absolute pleasure to watch for all ages.

I will enjoy this first volume, but now I'll wait for the one big box set of the whole show. Maybe in 2012?

It's great to see David Janssen again - a real adult, not a boy-with-attitude like so many of our leading men today. And he was only in his early thirties when the series began. Real, grown-up men like Janssen, Richard Boone, Henry Fonda and the others just aren't around anymore. I miss guys like that in our culture.

Maybe I will buy volume 2 after all!",1189987200,5,896,4.3273809523809526

Oh well, I reiterate then that, in a nutshell, THE FUGITIVE had great acting, writing and production values.
Also as others have said, why the heck does it take forever for great old shows like this to come out on DVD when loads of today's crappy TV shows get released right away!!
Okay, I'm done and thankful that atleast some of the ""good stuff"" does finally get a DVD release.",1189987200,3,429,4.443037974683544

2832673,5,B000Q6GUSE,"It's embarassing to try and remember how many times I've checked online to see if CBS was ever going to release ""The Fugitive"" on DVD. This show is about twenty years before my time but got hooked on it in syndication in the 90's (thank you WWOR). After years of waiting, one of the best dramas of the 60s is here on DVD and it was worth the wait. There are 15 episodes in this collection (120 total in the series) Each episode looks and sounds terrific, I'm about 3/4 through my set (trying to take my time, not knowing when the next volume is coming) and have yet to see an episode I didn't think was amazing. David Janssen and Barry Morse are splendidly human and empathetic in their portrayals of prey and predator, all the guest stars (known and unknown) more than pull their weight and the constant unyeilding change of scenery really gives you an understanding of the oppressive nature of his involuntarily nomadic lifestyle.

This show is formulaic, but proves that following a formula doesn't have to be a shortcoming when the execution is outstanding. That's as much a credit to the writers as it is to the numerous directors who took the reigns from episode to episode; many of the directors and writers had backgrounds in film and it shows as every episode feels like a movie, filled with real emotional content (dare I say drama?), and good old-fashioned suspense. As a viewer you find yourself genuinely caring about the characters and almost stressing over their fates.

My only lament is the absence of special features (I know most of the people involved with the show have passed on but it would be nice to hear some anecdotes from Barry Morse at the least, somebody needs to put that man in an easy chair and just roll film, let him talk, it doesn't have to be an Orson Welles production...). But even with the absence of special features, this is a great buy for any fans of the show, any fans of the movie with Harrison Ford, any fans of great television, any fans of great storytelling and acting. Treat yourself to one of the bright points in American television, am positive this is one of the great TV-on-DVD purchases you can make, take a chance and discover!",1189900800,3,2185,4.557251908396947

Anyone who has ever been blamed for something they didn't do will appreciate Dr. Kimble's plight.  This set includes two of my favorite episodes. The first is one where Dr. Kimble, working as a field laborer with some illegal aliens from Mexico, much choose between being caught and delivering a baby for some people that have been extremely unkind to him.  Of course, he delivers the baby and narrowly escapes.  In my other favorite episode, he learns that his father, also a doctor, is ill, and returns home to Indiana which is the most dangerous place for him since he is well known there.  While in Stafford, Indiana, he agrees to turn himself in unless his younger brother, who blames Dr, Kimble for everything that has gone wrong in his life, agrees to forgive him.  There are many very famous people in these initial episodes including Brian Keith (Family Affair), Jack Klugman (The Odd Couple), and James Best (The Dukes of Hazzard).  However, the acting of David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble and Barry Morse as Police Lt. Gerard is absolutely superb.  Highly recommended!!",1189555200,3,1269,4.842592592592593

Now, 40 years later, he's on the run again as this truly great dramatic series is finally (!!!) available on DVD.  I was fifteen at the time the series ended, and after faithfully following it for 4 years, I still couldn't get enough of it even though I was immensely relieved Kimble's ordeal was over.  Now, at fifty-five, watching these episodes again, I feel as much nail-biting tension as when they first ran.  Many of us then identified with Richard Kimble, we all felt like lonely outsiders trying to find our way out of the cold.  What a great treat for all us 'old-timers' who were there at the beginning.  This series featured a lot of great guest stars and character actors who, sadly, are no longer with us.  I hope those coming to this series for the first time appreciate all the talent this program showcased--names familiar to me but largely unknown in this day.

2832680,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I've watched the first 8 episodes and all are of high quality, not a dog in the bunch. Most shows become predictable in settings, characters etc. but each Fugitive episode is entirely different. Another thing I really like about the show is it's naturalness in capturing a gradually vanishing Americana landscape- what kind of mood are you gonna recreate in Best Buy, 711, KMart, wal-mart and so forth...that's why so many modern day thrillers even when executed well can't compare to the old film noir's where a bus station, diner, service station, etc. can create a great backdrop to enhance the story. David Janssen was like Sean Connery in James Bond, or Peter Falk as Columbo-perfect. He captures the everyman, with great cunning, to fit into the new pickle he finds himself in  each week. Never able to truly relax even when he finds love, or a seemingly idyllic situation, there's always a complication, his constant past, and Lt. Gerrard in the shadows. This is a very good deal even if you only watch the episodes once they are only a litle over 2 dollars apiece, so it is highly recommended.

2832682,5,B000Q6GUSE,"If you grew up in the Sixties you may have found that some of your cultural touchstones haven't aged that well when revisited four decades later. The opposite is true in the case of The Fugitive, which I regard as possibly the finest dramatic series ever brought into our living rooms.

Certainly by a mile the most compelling. You simply can't take your eyes off the screen.

When I was in my early teens the fate of Dr. Richard Kimble was an ongoing topic of conversation just as much as the Beatles, Vietnam and the space program were. We knew it was fiction, but David Janssen's performance was so profoundly human, painful and riveting that it got under your skin, which explains why the final episode of the series, in which the hero finally confronts the one armed man, drew one of the largest audiences in the history of television.

As I view the series now it strikes me that The Fugitive also spoke secondarily to the fact that the American Dream was perhaps just that, a dream. A very dark and lonely dream, for what Kimble encountered as often as support and friendship was danger, cold and unforgiving urban sidewalks and an uncaring, brittle countryside.

What we're reminded of in this superbly crafted DVD set is the overall excellence of the shows Quinn Martin Productions brought us, from the unusual casting choices, exceptionally deep performances, clever and twisting plot scenarios and flawless editing and camerawork. And what great, great writing.

Thank you David Janssen for creating one of the medium's most unforgettable characters, and for delivering more emotion in a glance than most TV actors are able to muster in an entire career.",1189209600,10,1665,4.848591549295775
2832683,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Finally The Fugitive starts to be released on DVD. I first caught the show in 1990 when it was being shown on A&E and fell in love with it right away. David Janssen is great as Richard Kimble. He brings so much to the character. The episodes are all well done. You will see some familiar faces when they were a lot younger and some not-so-familiar faces in these episodes and all of them do excellent jobs. This show was of such a high quality on virtually all fronts that I easily call it one of the best shows ever. I love the period that the show takes place. The episodes in this set (the first half of season one) aired from September 1963 to January 1964. JFK was President when the show premiered and Hitchcock's Marnie was just about to go into production. For those newcomers to the show who might have a problem with its time period (thinking it too old-fashioned), just look at it as a time capsule of 1963. All of the stories are engaging, though. Every one of them.

As far as the quality of the set goes, the transfers are all very good considering their age. Most episodes look very sharp. The remastered mono sound mix is good also. No extras though. I don't really mind having the season split up into two sets, as long as they don't take too long to get the rest of them out.

For you music fans, notice the Jerry Goldsmith music from the episode of The Twilight Zone called ""The Invaders"" (Agnes Moorehead with the little robot and spaceship on the roof of her farmhouse) is used repeatedly thoughout The Fugitive series as a stinger cue. Also notice the music that is unmistakably Bernard Herrmann's in the episode ""The Girl From Little Egypt"" (also from an episode of The Twilight Zone called ""Walking Distance;"" it plays during the flashback of Richard Kimble talking to his wife in her hospital room after their son was stillborn).

To the people who have never seen this show before and are even remotely interested, I highly recommend it. You won't be sorry.",1189209600,6,1983,4.487534626038781

The acting stands the test of time.  The narration by William ""Canon"" Conrad and the music, a haunting score by Pete Rugolo, famous for other music in a variety of shows and movies is suberb. You will recognize an entourage of great charactor and well known actors and actresses from the 60's, 70's and even 80's. David Janssen is outstanding in the role of falsely accused Dr. Richard Kimble, an innocent victim of blind justice.

The episodes are well written with some later in the series truly ground breaking and influencial on then current events.  The final episode was the most anticipated event in TV series history up to that time.

The acting by Canadian actor Barry Morse is exceptional. He is a truly versatile actor. What I missed and hoped for was a special feature added to the World Vision-Nu Ventures VHS Collectors Anthology Series versions back in the early 90's. That series included an introduction to each episode by Barry Morse which included some anecdotal and background material.

I haven't given the set 5 stars only because there are no extra features and because of the troublesome notice on the back of box about possible editing and changes in music from the original broadcast versions. Regarding possible changes in music: some of these episodes definitely have various music scores from another CBS network TV show The Twilight Zone used as background music in some places. I am a Zone fan and I'm certain of this. On episode 2 of this Fugitive set ""The Witch"" some of the background music is the same as the Zone episode ""On Thursday We Leave For Home."" In ""The Witch"" this music comes near the end when Kimble is talking to the little girl right before the mob of angry towns people come to kill him. In the Zone episode this music is being played when James Whitmore is in the asteroid cave with the space colonists describing what Earth is like. Check it out for yourself. Also, on the Fugitive episode ""Nightmare In Northoak"" there are 2 or 3 Twilight Zone background music scores used.  Maybe the CBS TV network back in the 1960s was in the habit of using the same music on different shows. Or more likely, this is a case of tampering with the broadcast originals for the DVD version.

2832703,5,B000Q6GUSE,"What is it that makes a television show a particularly great one, or that makes it highly memorable, or that makes it eminently rewatchable time after time?

Is it the actors? The characters and the interaction between them? The surroundings? The writing? The direction? The photography? The atmosphere? The music? Or the believability of the stories being told on the screen?

The answer, of course, is ""All of the above"". And when a TV series comes along that earns very high marks in every single one of the above-mentioned categories, as I believe ""The Fugitive"" (the original 1960s version) easily accomplishes, then I think it's safe to say that such a television program is deserving of an ample amount of attention (and praise).

And it's for those reasons I am proud to call Quinn Martin's ""The Fugitive"" one of my favorite TV series of all-time....and certainly my very favorite drama series ever shown on television.

For four seasons, David Janssen starred as Richard Kimble, a soft-spoken doctor who was falsely convicted for the murder of his wife.* Dr. Kimble was kept running for 120 TV episodes from 1963 to 1967.

The first 15 of those shows are presented in this nicely-done, 4-Disc DVD boxed set from Paramount Home Entertainment.

* = For those people who are totally unfamiliar with this TV series, the above declaration of Kimble's innocence is not a ""spoiler"" of any kind. And that's because the viewing audience is told, point-blank, within the first few seconds of the opening credits of the very first episode that Dr. Richard Kimble is ""innocent"" of the murder charge for which he was convicted.

""The Fugitive"" made its debut at 10:00 PM (east-coast time) on Tuesday, September 17, 1963, when ABC-TV aired the pilot episode, ""Fear In A Desert City"".

The final show of the series (""The Judgment""), which was first broadcast in the United States in August 1967, is one of the highest-rated television programs ever. At the time of its initial airing, in fact, ""The Judgment Part 2"" surpassed all records and became the single most-watched program ever aired in the USA. It was eclipsed 13 years later by an episode of ""Dallas"" (and then by the final episode of ""M*A*S*H"" in 1983).

In addition to its always well-written scripts, much of the enjoyment of ""The Fugitive"" (for me) lies in its&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/instantly-recognizable-music/dp/B0000560K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">instantly-recognizable music</a>, composed by Pete Rugolo. The main title theme plus the wide variety of mood-enhancing musical cues and ""bridges"" used in each episode evoke singular thoughts and memories of this 1960s TV series. It's impossible to imagine any other music being used for this show. It's utterly perfect for this program.

Not all of the music we hear in ""The Fugitive"" was written by Rugolo, however. Some of the background musical arrangements for parts of the episodes were taken from Hollywood's vast library of ""stock"" music. But this music blends in nicely with Rugolo's classic compositions. Some of the ""Fugitive"" music can also be found in other popular TV shows of that era, like ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"".

""The Fugitive"" also benefited greatly from a very talented cast....beginning, of course, with David Janssen as the title character. Sadly, Janssen (born David Harold Meyer) died way too soon, passing away of a heart attack in February 1980. He hadn't even turned 50. David was nominated for an Emmy Award three times during his 4-year stint as the perpetually running physician on ""The Fugitive"".

Janssen's performance as Richard Kimble, right from the get-go in ""Fear In A Desert City"", somehow already seemed refined and tuned to just the right pitch. It's really quite remarkable that Janssen was able to accomplish such a ""veteran"" feel to his character after just a single episode.

The series, in my opinion, also possessed just the right ""feel"" to it starting with the very first show. Many TV series fail to reach full stride or their full potential in their rookie season. I'd say that ""The Fugitive"", thanks to a great cast and the top-notch writing and directing, was a series that didn't suffer from this common problem.

Dr. Kimble's chief nemesis throughout the four-year run of the series was Indiana Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard, played to absolute perfection by London-born actor Barry Morse.

Morse's portrayal of Gerard counters Janssen's Kimble to a tee. Invariably, the very best ""Fugitive"" episodes were the ones in which Gerard was on screen, physically pursuing his elusive prey.

Morse/Gerard is relentless in his pursuit of the prisoner who slipped through his grasp when fate intervened. But, then too, Gerard isn't overly ruthless or blood-thirsty. He still maintains some level of compassion and kindness, even though his #1 priority in every episode in which he appears is to do his duty as ""an instrument of the law"" and re-capture Dr. Kimble.

The character of Philip Gerard actually appeared in less than 40 of the 120 episodes during the series (not counting the opening credits, where he is always shown). It truly seemed, though, as if Morse had actually appeared in many additional episodes. Gerard's ""presence"" is felt in nearly every show. But in most of them he's not physically shown on camera.

Other semi-regular ""Fugitive"" cast members include Bill Raisch (as the ""one-armed man"", Fred Johnson), Jacqueline Scott (who portrays Richard Kimble's sister, Donna), and Paul Birch (as Captain Carpenter).

Raisch, by the way, really did have an arm missing. He lost part of his right arm during World War 2, after being badly burned while fighting a fire.

Also worthy of an endorsement is William Conrad, who is never seen on the screen, but who has a strong presence in every episode as the very capable narrator.

Conrad's booming voice is heard at the start of each show throughout the series (except one, ""The Girl From Little Egypt""), as he smoothly ushers the audience into Richard Kimble's world.

We also hear Conrad again at the end of every episode, at the conclusion of the epilog scene, when he often reminds us of Dr. Kimble's ongoing predicament -- ""This is the way it is with him....because Richard Kimble is....a fugitive.""

In addition to its stellar main cast and narrator, ""The Fugitive"" offered up plenty of opportunities to feature a large selection of Hollywood talent in supporting roles. Many top-name actors appeared in the series.

In the first season alone (covering 30 total episodes), the roster of guest stars included: Robert Duvall, Leslie Nielsen, Jack Klugman, Carroll O'Connor, Jack Weston, Bruce Dern, Joanna Moore, Beverly Garland, Telly Savalas, Vera Miles, Tim O'Connor, Jerry Paris, George Voskovec, Eileen Heckart, Frank Sutton, Warren Oates, Brenda Vaccaro, Gilbert Roland, Pat Crowley, Ruta Lee, James Best, John Fiedler, Susan Oliver, Brian Keith, Claude Akins, and Lee Grant.

Some of my all-time favorite ""Fuge"" episodes are located within the very first season of the series, including a few of the 15 shows we find in this DVD set -- such as: ""Fear In A Desert City"", ""The Girl From Little Egypt"", ""Nightmare At Northoak"", and the two-parter ""Never Wave Goodbye"".

Actually, in my opinion, ""Volume 2"" of the first season of ""The Fugitive"" (which is bound to follow this first volume in relatively short order; knock wood) will contain even a better batch of overall episodes than Volume 1.

When the second half of Season 1 emerges on DVD, some of the top-flight Fugitive offerings that we'll be in store for include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Search-In-A-Windy-City/dp/6302767946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Search In A Windy City""</a>, ""Somebody To Remember"", ""The End Game"", ""Rat In A Corner"", and the fabulous two-part episode ""Angels Travel On Lonely Roads"" (with Eileen Heckart giving a superb performance as Kimble's travelling companion).

The DVD video quality for these fifteen ""Volume 1"" programs is stunning....glorious....fabulous....picture-perfect (take your pick from any of these descriptive terms, because I think they all apply).

I was immediately struck by the image clarity right from the very first moments of ""Fear In A Desert City"" on Disc 1 (as Richard Kimble's bus pulls into the Tucson terminal).

Each of these episodes has been ""transferred from the original negative with restored audio"" (per a notation on the back of the DVD box). And you can hardly ask for more than that.

The superb black-and-white photography that helps propel each of these episodes looks incredibly clean and crisp and almost blemish-free on these DVDs. A little bit of grain and/or a few dirt specks pop up here and there....but the overall grade for the ""PQ"" on this DVD set can't be anything less than an ""A"", in my opinion.

The deep blacks that make up the many night shots and shadowy scenes contained within many of these episodes are simply beautiful, even when viewed on a large-screen TV.

The mono audio sounds quite good too, with Pete Rugolo's incomparable music coming through in fine style here.

The DVD packaging claims that some music ""has been changed"" for this Paramount DVD release, and that ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"".

I, however, haven't been able to detect any major changes or edits of any kind. Perhaps there are a few and I haven't noticed them; I'm not sure. But the average episode running time on these four discs is more than 51 minutes per show....so if anything has been cut out, it sure can't amount to very much.

About the only ""change"" that I can see pertains to the opening credits for the first episode (""Fear In A Desert City""). That show's opening on the DVD could possibly be a slightly different version of the title sequence from what originally aired on TV in 1963.

And there's also a different piece of music utilized during the ""Desert City"" opening when compared with a VHS tape I have for that episode, which could conceivably account for each of the package disclaimers for this DVD release (the parts about both ""music"" and ""edits"").

Note: When originally aired, the first season of the series did not include any ""previews"" at the start of each episode. Those ""coming up next"" type of preview scenes weren't included until Season #2.

===================

DVD STATS:

Video: Original TV ratio of 1.33:1 (Full Frame). All episodes are in crisp, exquisite-looking black-and-white.

Audio: Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (English only).

Subtitles: None. But English ""Closed Captioning"" is available for all fifteen shows. Just remember to switch off ""Progressive Scanning"" on your DVD player. If you don't turn that off, the captions will never appear on screen. At least it's that way with all Panasonic DVD players that I've owned. It's possible that other players vary regarding this strange ""captioning"" anomaly.

Chapter Stops?: Yes. There are 7 chapters per episode, with each break coming at appropriate locations throughout each program -- at the end of each ""Act"", as well as a break just after the opening credits and right after the ""Epilog"" scene. Perfectly done.

Menus: Non-animated. No music. There are no Sub-Menus at all. Each disc has a simple but efficient Main Menu which provides access to that disc's three or four episodes (plus a ""Play All"" option).

Discs: Single-sided, Dual-layered.

Bonus Material: None (except for a few ""Previews"" advertising some other DVDs, viewable on Disc 1 only).

Paper Enclosures: None.

DVD Packaging: A standard style plastic ""Keepcase"" has been used for this 4-Disc set, which nicely holds the four discs in a compact manner via an extra ""page"" that has been inserted inside the case which holds Discs 2 and 3. The case is clear, with episode information visible on the inner panels of the case (when Discs 1 and 4 are removed, that is).

I kind of like this packaging style. This is the first multi-disc DVD set I've bought which uses this type of case, and it's a real space-saver, to be sure.

===================

THE EPISODES:

Here's a look at the 15 programs that fill up these four ""Season 1/Volume 1"" discs. I've also listed the aliases that Richard Kimble used for each episode; plus I've added the original TV air dates and a few selected comments of my own for some of the shows.....

1. ""Fear In A Desert City"" (First Aired: September 17, 1963) .... Alias: ""James Lincoln"". .... ""The Fugitive"" burst onto American television screens with a great amount of style right off the bat, via this spectacular debut/pilot episode.

The brilliant series-opening program gives us our first look at David Janssen's perfectly-controlled portrayal of the falsely-accused doctor from Indiana who was sentenced to death after being convicted of murdering his wife, Helen. A train wreck freed Dr. Kimble on his way to the ""death house"". Thus, Kimble's four-year TV flight from the law begins with this first exciting episode.

From this very first show, we (the audience) can feel the tension that surrounds Richard Kimble. It's also quite easy for the viewing audience, right from this initial episode, to feel a great deal of empathy (and sympathy) for Dr. Kimble and his plight, by way of the fabulous writing that exists within this script (and virtually all those that followed it).

The first ""Fuge"" has Kimble tending bar at the ""Branding Iron Saloon"" in Tucson, Arizona, where he soon becomes embroiled in the lives of the saloon's lovely piano player (played by Vera Miles) and her abusive and hot-headed husband (Brian Keith).

Miles and Keith are both excellent in their ""Desert City"" roles -- particularly Keith, who is savagely brutal and menacing here, to the point of being downright scary. Keith plays ""Ed Welles"", who teems with a raging fury that practically burns through the TV screen. It's a fabulous performance.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-In-A-Desert-City/dp/B00065X2OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Fear In A Desert City""</a>, which was directed by Walter Grauman and written by Stanford Whitmore, also co-stars Barney Phillips, Dabbs Greer, and Harry Townes.

Just days prior to filming the pilot episode, David Janssen said this to director Walter Grauman:

""Wally, you're really going to have to help me. I've been used to doing 'Richard Diamond'; all this shallow [expletive deleted]. There's a lot of character here with Richard Kimble. I don't know whether I can act it.""

Well....the rest is Fugitive History. I'd say David's worries were unfounded. He did, indeed, ""act it""....and did it very well too.

Another interesting piece of trivia concerning the pilot show -- David Janssen suffered three broken ribs during the fight scene with Brian Keith in Act IV of the first episode. It was the first of many physical injuries that David sustained during the making of the 120 episodes of this TV series.

2. ""The Witch"" (September 24, 1963) .... Alias: ""Jim Fowler"".

3. ""The Other Side Of The Mountain"" (October 1, 1963) .... No alias used.

4.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Wave-Goodbye-Part-1/dp/6304865430/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Never Wave Goodbye; Part 1""</a>&nbsp;(October 8, 1963) .... Alias: ""Jeff Cooper"". .... The series would occasionally incorporate a ""Two-Parter"", with this being the first such example.

The ingenuity and shrewdness of both Kimble and Lt. Gerard are fully evident in this top-notch 2-part program, with Kimble (naturally) slipping through Gerard's fingers yet again (via a rather clever scheme of faking his own death).

5. ""Never Wave Goodbye; Part 2"" (October 15, 1963) .... Alias: ""Jeff Cooper"".

6. ""Decision In The Ring"" (October 22, 1963) .... Alias: ""Ray Miller"".

7. ""Smoke Screen"" (October 29, 1963) .... Alias: ""Joseph Walker"".

8. ""See Hollywood And Die"" (November 5, 1963) .... Alias: ""Al Fleming"". .... It's yet another strong acting turn for Mr. Janssen, as he spends the bulk of this episode pretending to be a real bad guy in the company of two kidnappers who abduct guest star Brenda Vaccaro. It's actually kind of a ""double"" performance we find here, with Janssen portraying Richard Kimble, and Kimble playing a part of his own.

9. ""Ticket To Alaska"" (November 12, 1963) .... Alias: ""Larry Talman"".

10. ""Fatso"" (November 19, 1963) .... Alias: ""Bill Carter"".

11. ""Nightmare At Northoak"" (November 26, 1963) .... Alias: ""George Porter"". .... Regarded by many as one of the top shows of the whole series, ""Northoak"" (which aired just one day after assassinated President John F. Kennedy was laid to rest) combines several different plot-developing elements that helped make this TV series such a great one for four consecutive seasons, e.g.:

The never-ending chase of Dr. Kimble by Lt. Gerard (and this time the detective actually catches up with the good doctor, only to lose him in the end); plus: Kimble's own heroism (he rescues several children from a burning school bus here); plus: Kimble's habit of continually--and inadvertently--running into law-enforcement officials during his travels (in ""Northoak"", he's nursed back to health by the local sheriff and his wife after being injured while saving the children on the bus).

""Northoak"" is, indeed, a dandy episode, and a big reason for that (IMO) is because we get to watch Kimble and Gerard interact with each another during a terrific jail-cell scene, during which we get to see David Janssen really sink his teeth into his role of Dr. Richard Kimble (i.e., an embittered, tired, and completely-innocent fugitive from justice).

During that extraordinary jail scene, Kimble's anger and frustration come pouring out, as he confronts Gerard with one of the best lines from the series: ""Your nightmare is when I'm dead, you'll find him.""

""Act IV"" of ""Northoak"" is worth replaying....again and again.

12.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glass-Tightrope/dp/6304865449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Glass Tightrope""</a>&nbsp;(December 3, 1963) .... Aliases: ""Harry Carson"" and ""George Paxton"".

13.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terror-At-High-Point/dp/6304865449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Terror At High Point""</a>&nbsp;(December 17, 1963) .... Alias: ""Paul Beaumont"".

14. ""The Girl From Little Egypt"" (December 24, 1963) .... Aliases: ""George Browning"" and ""George Norton"". .... This episode, for the first time in the series, lays out the backstory of Richard Kimble's plight. And getting to see a pre-fugitive ""salt-and-pepper""-haired Dr. Kimble during a few scenes in ""Little Egypt"" is a rare treat indeed.

15. ""Home Is The Hunted"" (January 7, 1964) .... No alias used. .... This fifteen-show collection concludes with this dandy installment, which has Dr. Kimble travelling back home to Stafford, Indiana, for the first time in the series to touch base again with his father (played by Robert Keith), his sister Donna (Jacqueline Scott), and younger brother Ray (Andrew Prine).

Prine, IMO, is particularly impressive in his role as Ray Kimble, who has some doubts about his brother's innocence (until Act IV of this episode, that is).

""Home Is The Hunted"" also includes Lt. Gerard bearing down on Kimble once again. (It's just a good thing that Gerard didn't catch a glimpse of that bottle of hair dye at the Kimble family home.)

Billy Mumy and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) also appear in this 15th show of the series, as Donna's two young sons.

FURTHER FUGE FUN:

If you'd like to see what my ultimate ""Fugitive Fantasy DVD"" would look like, you can check out my review on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THIS-AMAZON-WEBPAGE/dp/6304865457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THIS AMAZON WEBPAGE</a>.

That page links to one of the several ""Fugitive"" VHS videotapes that have been released over the years. And that particular tape features two of the very finest Fuge installments, ""Nemesis"" and ""World's End"", both from Season #2 of the series.

If that ""Dream DVD"" of mine ever gets produced, it will be ample proof that miracles truly ARE possible. ~grin~

===================

A FINAL WORD OR TWO:

David Janssen's portrayal of Dr. Richard Kimble (""an innocent victim of blind justice"") is low-key and subtle and understated. Richard Kimble, though, through Janssen's patented ""twitch"" or a faint smile or just a silent look, can move a viewer emotionally. At least I think he can....and he does (often) throughout the four-year lifespan of one of the best television programs to ever appear in American living rooms -- ""The Fugitive"".

This 4-Disc DVD collection is the first of what will hopefully be eight such DVD sets of ""The Fugitive"" to be released by Paramount. Each of the four seasons of this series positively deserves the right to be digitally preserved for eternity onto the Digital Disc format. It's just too good a series to not be treated with such respect. And that includes even the final year of the series, which was the only season filmed in color.

That fourth season does contain a few lesser-quality episodes, IMO, but there are still many first-rate gems and pulse-pounding ""Gerard Chasing Kimble"" entries to be found among the thirty shows of Season 4, too.

But to begin your wonderful and wandering journey into the sometimes-frantic and always-interesting life of ""The Fugitive"", you'll want to pick up this DVD set with the first 15 episodes from Season 1.

If there was ever a ""must have"" TV-on-DVD set to own and collect, this would certainly rank as one such set, in my Fuge-favoring opinion. And I'd be willing to bet the one-armed man's remaining limb that almost everyone else who buys this DVD collection will agree with that ""collectible"" assessment as well. ;)

2832704,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Hi folks,
If I do remember correctly, The Fugitive, starring the late Dave Janssen came on the TV screen about the same time as Mission Impossible, The High Chaparral and The Saint (British Roger Moore)...
Those were the ""good old years"" of 1960s and which were aired weekly depending on where you live then.
I like Dave Janssen because his acting ability in The Fugitive series was so natural, talented and  excellent...even though, poor guy, he was always on the run and always  one step ahead of being apprehended by the law and disappointed  those who were bent on  betraying  him!
It is a pity that superb actor David Janssen is no longer with us and therefore unable to relate how he comes by with such an exciting role.
As compared with the later version of The Fugitive, starring Harrison Ford, though exciting and humourous at times, both versions have their own merits. But personally, I still prefer the original TV series. I have ordered  Season 1 and look forward with excitement  to receiving it soon. I hope Season 2 would come out before the year is through.
So go for it folks if you have not seen the original TV series on The Fugitive...never a dull moment! Thanks and goodbye for now.",1187654400,,1204,4.624413145539906
2832705,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Stephen King calls ""The Fugitive"" the best dramatic series ever, and he's right. Even after 40 years, it still holds up because of the care taken in writing, production and casting. David Janssen was the best television series actor ever, bar none, and he is at the top of his game here. Barry Morse is superb as Lt. Gerard, and the guest stars are a ""Who's Who"" of stars before they were stars -- testament to the care taken in casting the show. Television doesn't get any better than this. While it would have been nice to have some extras (a retrospective from some of those guest stars perhaps?), it's more important that the episodes themselves be the highest quality possible, and here Paramount shines. The video is crystal clear with almost no dust or scratches (I saw only one vertical line in part of one episode), and the audio is crisp and clean. It's obvious that Paramount took great care in the transfer process. This continues a good streak for Paramount video. The transfers of ""The Untouchables"" and ""Hawaii Five-O"" are impeccable as well.",1187654400,,1057,4.718918918918919
2832706,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Yeah, the film version with Harrison Ford was fine, but let's face it - David Janssen IS Richard Kimble: a fugitive wrongly accused and convicted of killing his wife. Janssen's nervous twitching, constant looking-over-his-shoulder and narrow escapes keep you on your toes and the edge of your seat - this is one of the most stressful TV shows ever! You KNOW Kimble won't get caught - and if he is, he always gets away - but you find yourself holding your breath, curling your toes, talking to the screen, clasping your hands and biting your nails & lower lip as Kimble comes oh-so-close to getting nabbed, show after show.

Even though this set includes only Season One's first 15 episodes, there are scads of great guest stars, including Alejandro Rey, Andrew Prine, Barbara Pepper (Mrs. Ziffel on ""Green Acres""), Beverly Garland, Bing Russell (Kurt's dad), Billy Halop (original ""Dead End Kid""!), Billy Mumy, Bobs Watson (kid actor in ""Boy's Town"" with Mickey Rooney), Brenda Vaccaro, Brian Keith, Bruce Dern, Buck Taylor ""Gunsmoke""), Charles Herbert (""13 Ghosts""), Clint Howard, Dabbs Greer, David White (""Larry Tate"" on ""Bewitched""), Diane Brewster (formerly Miss Canfield on ""Leave It To Beaver,""as Richard Kimble's wife, Helen), Ed Nelson, Elisha Cook
Jr., Forrest Compton (of ""Gomer Pyle, USMC""), Frank Sutton, Glenda Farrell (of 1933's ""Mystery Of The Wax Museum""), Hari Rhodes, Harry Hickox (""The Music Man""), Ian Wolfe, J. Pat O'Malley, Jack Klugman, Jack Weston, James Best, James Sikking, Jerry Paris, Jimmy Hawkins, Leslie Nielsen, Lou Antonio, Pamela Tiffin (who has many similarities to Paris Hilton), Patricia Crowley (""Please Don't Eat The Daisies""), R.G. Armstrong, Robert Duvall, Robert Quarry (""Count Yorga""), Ruby Dee, Sandy Dennis, Sue Randall (formerly Miss Landers on ""Leave It To Beaver""), Susan Oliver, Tim O'Connor, Vera Miles, and William Conrad, who narrates the series.

And there are many other character actors whose names you may not know, but you'll recognize the faces. You'll see one guy who appeared in a couple of Three Stooges shorts.

You'll also notice sets that are used on other TV shows - one in particular, the lake where Andy & Opie Taylor went fishin'.

The 14th episode, ""The Girl From Little Egypt,"" relates the tale of the
murder, and we get our first glimpse of the great Bill Raisch as the one-armed man. Raisch was so believable as the villain that you think they hired a real con to play this role - but Raisch was already a veteran actor, making his film debut in 1944, before landing his career-defining role as Fred Johnson, one-armed murderer. He was also an accomplished dancer, and was asked to join the Ziegfeld Follies during the 1920's! He served in WWII in the Navy and lost his right arm; it was severely burned as he and others attempted to put out a fire aboard ship in 1945.

Barry Morse as Lieutenant Gerard is often regarded as the ""bad guy"" of the show, only because he's after our pal, Dr. Kimble - but he's actually a dedicated, honest lawman trying to do his sworn duty by bringing in an escaped con, even though he deep-down thinks Kimble is innocent.

In the final episode on this set, ""Home Is The Hunted,"" we meet Kimble's
whole family - dad, sister, nephews and younger brother.

Unfortunately, we've lost two of these great actors; David Janssen died of a heart attack in 1980, Bill Raisch of lung cancer in 1984.

Before the fourth (and last) season finale aired in August of 1967, there was an article about how the TV show might wind up - some speculated that Lt. Gerard was the real murderer, as he was so relentless about bringing Kimble in. Janssen himself expressed his desire to end the show the following way: in the show's finale, the one-armed man would be caught, tried & convicted and Dr. Richard Kimble would be cleared and set free. In the very last shot, Kimble would be standing along the edge of the ocean. He'd reach over, unscrew his artificial arm, throw it into the sea and walk out into the water as the scene faded. So HE would've been the REAL one-armed man who killed Helen Kimble! But producers didn't want to
upset fans of the show, who regarded Kimble as their hero; it would've been too crushing to learn that Kimble had really murdered his wife. I'm sure most of you reading this know the outcome in Season Four, so I won't re-hash it and give it away it for those who don't.

THE FUGITIVE is an outstanding adult drama that deserves five stars for the show, but CBS Video has screwed us by cutting Season One in half with this set, with NO special features. Even though greedy corporate weasels control these releases, at least we can breathe a sigh of relief that we can now once again enjoy this great series, hopefully in it's entirety.",1187481600,4,4751,4.777101096224117
2832707,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I have been waiting for the DVD to be released before I did my review. I appreciate all of the comments about the show from others but, when I read a review, I want to know more about the quaility of the show on the DVD.
The people at Paramount have went all out for this release of The Fugitive. I feel they gave it almost the kid gloves tact they gave I Love Lucy.
I must say first though, I do not understand the disclaimer on the back that music has been changed and some episodes are edited. From what I can tell, there are no music changes and no missing footage. I compared these to my TV copies and they are just like my TV copies: just better!
There is a disclaimer that these have been transfered from the origianl negative with restored audio. This I believe and I see. The picture, for me, has NEVER looked better. The sound is awesome. I have been a Fugitive fan and collecotr for many years and these first 15 episodes have never looked better to me.
If any one at Paramount is reading this, please release the rest of the Fugitive in the same manor. Please do not go to the place where you are releasing edited episodes and music changes. The Fugitive never did have music of the day on the show so this should not be a problem. The 3rd season episode, ""Ill Wind"", has a song that was preformed on the show that was written for the show. It would be sad to see this changed since the song is in the episode so much and helps set the pace for the episode. Please Paramount, continue to release The Fugitive with all the episodes from all 4 seasons intact and remastered as you gave Volume One Season One! The treatment for this release is awesome and please keep up that outstanding pace! And please release the rest of the show, all 4 seasons, as soon as possible!!!
The only bad thing for me is that the first episode has a constant scratch through out almost the entire episode. But so does my official VHS release so I guess the original negative has this problem ans that you can not fix, sadly.

UPDATE QUESTION!!!!
Hey all, while watching Nightmare at Northoak I noticed something not
on any of my previous VHS releases or boot leg DVD's. When Kimble is
talking to the Sherriffs wife, trying to convince her to allow him to
escape when they were in the bed room, I noticed a real light streak of
light travel from top to bottom of the picture. This streak goes on for
several frames just before Kimble asks if it is too much to ask, a life
for a life. Any one else notice this? Any explanations as to why it is
there from a copy taken from the original negatives and not on the
previous DVD releases or the shows taped from A&E and transfered to DVD?
Just curious. Please let me know in the comment section if any one knows why! Thanks

The black and white picture here is solid and clear, not grainy and aged like it appeared on the reruns. Sure, there are a couple of specks here and there -- as well as a line running down the screen in the first episode - but it probably looks as good, if not better, than when it aired for the first time back in the 1960s.

Hopefully CBS/Paramount puts subsequent DVD volumes on the fast track and doesn't have consumers having to wait six months to a year for the next set. I guess it's hard to criticize them for splitting the seasons up in volumes. It's all about maximizing profit in this greedy world, and when you own the rights to one of the best television series of all time, you break it out in as many small sections as you can while inflating the price.

Box says some music has been changed and some episodes may be edited.  I have only watched a couple and have found no changes thus far.  It may be that CBS/Paramount simply puts this disclaimer on all their packaging, or it may have simply been on the template used for GOMER PYLE season two and someone forgot to change it.

In any event, this is a great series and we can only hope the next volume hits stores around Christmas.

By the way, it's a myth that you pay more for split season sets.  You actually pay a couple of dollars less for a combined complete season than you would if you boiught the whole thing at once.

UPDATE - I have watched the set and found no scenes missing or music changed (that I remember).  In fact, a few bits of scenes that did not air on the syndicated versions were restored for this release.  I am 99.9% certain everything is here.  If not for the disclaimer, I'd be 100%.

Even stock music is included unchanged, as well as local jukebox music.

Incredible writing, sharp direction and a distrust of authority that never goes out of style all combine to make this 1960s show just as good in the 2000s as when it first appeared.

Now for the problem: No extras. This is a shame since some were available. One VHS version of the shows included introductions by Barry Morse, who played the lieutenant forever pursuing the wrongly convicted Dr. Kimble. Why weren't these included?

Also, considering how influential and timeless this show was/is, I'm sure there's no shortage of TV historians who could've done great commentaries, perhaps Ed Robertson who wrote the 30th anniversary companion book to the series (if he's still alive).

I don't need to rehash a lot of what's already said by others about what makes ""The Fugitive"" so terrific, only to highlight two huge parts. There are few characters in all of TV who can make you feel great empathy for them the way David Janssen does as Richard Kimble. Pete Rugolo's music also does a tremendous job of putting you next to a wronged, lonely fugitive feeling threatened at every turn.

It's been a very long time since I have felt such anticipation at the release of something. I hate the gouging, but I hope we get all four seasons with at least some ABC promo materials.",1186790400,,739,4.507462686567164

So far, I've bought a few of the split seasons, Streets of San Francisco, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Big Valley's second season and even though I realize that the price tends to be a bit higher when the sets are split in two, I tend to get more enjoyment out of them. I have a busy schedule and watching + or- 13 or so episodes is much easier than having to digest a complete season. I know it's the same thing but to me it's a sense of accomplishment.

Most of these classic shows are all new to me and I thoroughly enjoy viewing them for the first time. I'm so glad to be able to see these almost forgotten programs, I really don't mind paying a little extra for the treat.

Why 5 stars? It's my prediction that I'll really enjoy The Fugitive. Thanks to the DVD format, and all of us out here who buy these classic television shows, we can all enjoy them again or for the first time.",1186531200,2,1129,4.076576576576577

2832733,5,B000Q6GUSE,"As you can see from all the reviews - the word ""finally"" is frequently used.  And rightly so!  This 60's TV drama was brilliant and loved by many back in the day.  Now younger audiences can get the chance to see this wonderful series starring David Janssen who was perfect for the role of Dr. Richard Kimble.  (If you enjoy the series 24, you will love The Fugitive.)  Janssen played the character with subtlety and coolness that you sympathized with and believed in.  Watch any of the episodes and you will see what I am talking about.  His body language and facial expressions alone could portray Kimble's complete character.  We see fear (always wondering if he will be caught) and, at the same time, confidence (managing to stay one step ahead of the police and Lt. Gerard).  The scripts were tightly written and episodes well directed by some of Hollywood's best (Ida Lupino, Laslo Benedek, Walter Grauman, Robert Butler, Richard Donner, Mark Rydell, and Joseph Sargent to name a few).  Pete Rugolo's musical score is also stunning.  The show received an Emmy award for Outstanding Dramatic Series of 1965 (it's second season) and was the highest watched show in TV history at the time (72% of the viewers) it aired the final episode  - The Judgment.

One last comment - this first volume has only 15 episodes.  Which means Paramount plans (I hope) to release a total of eight volumes (if you do the math) to complete the entire series (120 episodes).  I am asking Paramount for two favors (actually, I am pleading!): 1. Make sure you see this project through to the end - don't release a portion of the series and skip the rest.  The Fugitive deserves to be ALL out on DVD.  2. Don't take forever to release the remaining volumes.  Loyal fans have waited a long time for this to happen.....like most of the reviews say - FINALLY!

UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW - Now that volume one is in my hands and I am viewing the first 15 episodes, I just want to add that the sound quality and picture quality is excellent.  Yes there are a few spots that have lines in the film...but the B&W is stark and bold.  It adds to the drama in my opinion.  Peter Rugolo's musical score is also wonderful.  I am a composer and can appreciate good writing...and Peter was a great composer (He wrote for Stan Kenton and you can hear this in the soundtrack).

As you may notice that most of the reviews that are appearing here on amazon are five stars (the one star is for the most part being given for the price tag).  With reviews like this...doesn't that tell you something??  Fans will buy this TV drama - no doubt.  But I really encourage those who have never seen this series - buy this DVD - you will not be disappointed.  This is how TV drama should be.

Note to Paramount - how about releasing Volume 2 for Christmas??  PLEASE!",1184198400,8,2813,4.5019762845849804

Philip Gerard, and searching for the one-armed man who killed his wife, Helen Kimble.

As most of these wonderful series have NOT been in syndication for years, older viewers who have not seen these episodes for years and fans of the 1993 movie will find refreshing, quality entertainment from 40+ years ago.  Nothing in recent years has even come close.

2832740,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Finally.  But, why just volume 1?  After 44-years, why not just put out all 120-episodes on a full set of DVD's?  Getting this masterpiece on DVD has been like squeezing blood out of a stone.  How many more years until the entire series is done?  Also, I pray that they have not colorized the black and white episodes, per the illustration on the DVD box.  I, too, remember that night when I was a teenager, watching the last episode on our 19-inch Black and white TV (although it was then broadcast in color).  It seemed as if the whole country stopped and held its collective breath that evening, while justice was finally given to the noblest man who ever lived.  When I die, I want to be buried with these DVD's, and hopefully, by that time, I can be lowered into the ground with all the episodes.

The long awaited Fugitive DVD arrived a couple days ago, and I just let it set on the table for awhile, to heightened the excitement. My hands were shaking as I fumbled with the plastic, to open the box that I have dreamed about for so long. Naturally, I could complain about a few things: 1) the colorized cover (Black and White would have been more authentic); 2) Lack of extra features (of which plenty exist); 3) Getting only half-a-season; 4) The opening of the DVD menu - the cheesy, cartoonish graphics and layout, which seem alien and unrelated to the content; 5) The white, vertical scratch that appears on the right side of the first episode, which could have been fixed (if they can fix problems with orbiting spacecraft, they could fix this); 6) The dissapointment that the entire 120-episodes weren't released at once. But, thinking about the song lyrics in South Pacific, regarding various complaints about women, ""Be thankful for what they've got,"" I was really stunned at the video quality. (The audio quality of the VHS tapes was always good.) Whatever they did, those wonderful, mindless DVD-making geeks, the picture quality, for 1963 TV - video tape or 16-mm film (?), was absolutely amazing. Oddly, I felt a strange sadness to this sudden boost in overall quality. Overe the years, I had become so used to the grainy, blurry images from the bootlegged versions copied from TV broadcasts, that I had somehow internalized this look with the essential feel of what The Fugitive was all about. I had felt that this video griminess was part of The Fugitive's inherent, rarefied content. Now, this new sharper look seemed to take away from the familiar interpretation I had of each story. I hope that after watching more of these episodes, I will become acccommodated and readjusted to this new, improved look. It's all been a shock to my nervous system, not unlike when they changed Coke to New Coke, and then went back and renamed Coke as ""Classic Coke,"" and I had to resume therapy to work out the angst. Yet, when all is taken into account, all of our lives are the better with this little box of memories from the 1960's.",1181347200,5,2944,4.63531669865643

In this day of so much hatred between religions, and races, and preferences, Dr. Richard Kimble was what we all should strive to be.  Loving, caring, compassionate, and putting the simplest of needs and wants of others, ahead of his own.  Even if it meant getting captured.

The show only ran a few years, but what an impact it made. I believe, and it's been a long, long time ago, so bear with me, (you'll get old one day too if you're lucky and/or aren't already) that when the series had finally run it's course, the  final episode was watched by everyone in America. Women delayed childbirth to watch it. Bars, restaurants, and gas stations closed. Public transport ceased. Radio shut down, There was no professional sports activity that night. We were let off school early to prepare for the ultimate television experience. There were only three networks at the time, CBS, NBC, and ABC. NBC and CBS didn't broadcast at all that evening. Like I said, it's been quite some time ago, so I may not be completely accurate with all my details. However, trust me when I say that it doesn't get any better than this.",1180396800,7,1015,4.427807486631016
2832755,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I'll never understand why every terrible movie and television show that was ever made was released on DVD ages ago and perhaps the finest television series of the 60's - or perhaps of any decade - is only now being released.

I just don't get it, but better late than never.

I am so pleased that this series is finally being released. I was a young boy in the 60's and I recall getting hooked on this show early in the 1st season. Great story lines - great performances (both by David Janssen, Barry Morse and the guest stars) - excellent writing and wonderful suspense / drama at times.

I can't think of a single negative about this show. The first season was filmed entirely in black and white and this only contributed to the sometimes ""dark"" and serious tone to the series. The narration at the beginning and end of the series by William Conrad was a pleasure to listen to. And David J. was the perfect actor to play the part. He could be both strong and vulnerable at the same time and his character - Dr. Richard Kimble - was so honorable and admirable it was no wonder that so many people helped him to elude capture for so many years.

You look at the sorry state of television today - where networks continue to churn out the most stupid reality shows possible- and you wonder when it began to unravel. In fact, it's only getting worse. Is it any wonder that so many people are buying DVDs of classic tv shows and watching them over ""America's Next Top Model"" or whatever.

I'm getting ahead of myself here, but I sincerely hope the powers-that-be follow up season 1 with the release of season 2 and subsequent seasons as quickly as possible. I want to have the entire collection of this great show in my library as quickly as possible - before the idiots who make the decisions decide that maybe it would make more sense to issue some brainless tv show - instead of this classic..!

But for now - thanks for finally getting your act together - whatever caused you to get a grip on reality and decide to release it, I just hope you can stay lucid and smart enough for alittle while longer to release the other seasons.",1179878400,98,2129,4.3908629441624365
2832756,5,B000Q6GUSE,"If ""All in the Family"" was the beginning of modern comic television, then ""The Fugitive"" was certainly the beginning of modern dramatic television. Premiering in 1963, it was ahead of its time in so many ways - showing that the law was capable of making a mistake that could cost a man his life, that a member of law enforcement could be partially driven by darkness in his own personality that he mistook for a pure quest for justice, and realistically depicting the angst between family members and the quiet desperation in middle America in general. The first three seasons of this series' four season run is absolutely splendid. It did lose something in the fourth season, if my memory serves me correctly, when it went to color TV in its final year.

If I have any criticism of the show at all it is for a failure in the overall story arc. First - WARNING SPOILER AHEAD. I won't say who did actually commit the murder of Dr. Kimble's wife, but I will tell you who didn't and who the writers originally intended the murderer to be - Dr. Kimble's brother-in-law. The network suits - yes, they did exist and cause trouble even in the 1960's - decided that viewers would be completely turned off by the idea of a member of Kimble's family being both the culprit and also cheating on his own wife with a member of his own extended family - Dr. Kimble's wife. After four years of challenging the audience with ground-breaking stories about the civil rights movement, family violence, and small-town corruption, and the audience favorably responding to that challenge, the network executives should have had more faith.

At any rate, the first three seasons are fantastic, and you should enjoy the included first fifteen of the thirty episodes of season one tremendously. My favorite episode of the first fifteen is ""Home is the Hunted"", which is the fifteenth and final episode of this DVD set. In that episode Kimble returns to his hometown when he learns his father has had a heart attack. Knowing what I do about who the killer was originally intended to be makes this episode all the more powerful, especially since it is Kimble's sister and brother-in-law who take him in and hide him and who are both so sympathetic to him. Plus the confrontation between Dr. Kimble and his brother Ray in this episode is great drama.",1179532800,6,2322,4.67481662591687
2832757,5,B000Q6GUSE,"It's too bad that we have to wait almost the entire summer for THE FUGITIVE, to come out on DVD, but anyone who have ever seen this classic show, knows that it is worth the wait. Anyone who has never seen THE FUGITIVE...You're in for a treat! This is what good television drama is all about! They don't make television shows like this anymore. There are few television shows that should be on the top of the mountain, of high quality television. THE FUGITIVE, without a doubt...beyond the shadow of a doubt...beyond all doubt is on that mountain top.",1179446400,3,550,4.565656565656566
2832758,5,B000Q6GUSE,"At long last, the groundbreaking television series, ""The Fugitive"" comes to DVD. This show, which lasted from 1963-1967, was suspenseful, moving, engaging, and original. This was the first successful television show that took the dramatic formula of putting the hero with new characters and in new situations every week to another level. In previous shows such as Cheyenne, Maverick, and many others, the hero was a wanderer going from town to town to earn a living. In this show, the hero had no choice. He had to run to stay out of jail.

Charged with murdering his wife, a crime he did not commit, Dr. Richard Kimble, played by David Janssen, escapes from the law when the train taking him to his execution wrecks. Tracked doggedly by police inspector Gerard, Kimble wanders across the country running from the law while trying to track down the one-armed man he saw leaving his house the night his wife was murdered. As he wanders the country, he helps many people with their problems, all the while trying to find the one armed man and trying to avoid Gerard.

This classic show had all the goods - great acting by Janssen, Morse, and the many guest stars, fantastic narration by William Conrad, clever, well-written scripts, and taut direction. This show had it all, and made Dr. Richard Kimble one of the most famous and sympathetic characters television history. We can be glad that it has finally made it to DVD.",1179446400,57,1421,4.772357723577236
2832759,5,B000Q6GUSE,"Amazon makes the fugitive avaiable I believe on the 8th of may. At about 10;30 in the morning, it is ranked at about #659. At 3pm it is at #97 and at 3:50 #89 in dvd sales. I think that says about everything one needs to know about how popular this show was. It is about time it made it to dvd. I am sure I  speak for ALOT of people who share the same sentiment. Sales prove it ! David Janseen was the perfect person to play the compasionate and caring Dr. Richard Kimble. The nut job, Lt. Gerard, played by Barry Morse was the perfect person to portray a perfect example of  crazed and obsessed blind pursuit of justice.  The show injected so many different emotions and many life lessons to be learned as well. For me it was the best show television ever offered. It should go down as the best show on tv of all time period! No show can even come close.. And I liked alot of classic  tv shows that were without a doubt super shows. But,  The fugitive needs to be put on a high pedestal like it  is done when they give out the gold medal in the olympics. Everything else is silver and bronze.",1178582400,14,1093,4.107981220657277
2832760,5,B000Q6GUSE,"I haven't seen this series since it was last shown on A&E back in the early 90s.

Watching it back then, more than 30 years after its initial run, it had lost none of its dramatic bite.

This excellent dramatic TV series inspired by the famous Dr. Sam Sheppard murder case ran for 4 years on ABC (1963-67) is far and away better than the 1993 theatrical film release staring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.

The intensity of the performance by David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble is consistent through out the entire series, and as far as I'm concerned hasn't been matched in any TV series since.

Barry Morse's performance is as equally compelling as the obsessive Lt. Phillip Gerard.

TV Guide once called this series, ""the best TV drama of the 1960's"" I whole heartedly agree.

One of the best written and produced TV series in history, the writing and production values are so good they're used as an example by some colleges in their TV writing and Journalism courses.

I can't wait to hear William Conrad's introductory narration that kicked off each episode once again:

""Dr. Richard Kimble, an innocent victim of blind justice..... Falsely convicted for the murder of his wife.

""Reprieved by fate when a train wreck freeed him on route to the death house....""

""FREED To hide in lonely desperation, to toil at many jobs......""

""FREED HIM...To search for the one-armed man he saw leave the scene of the crime"".

""FREED HIM...To run before the relentless pursuit of the Police Lt. obsessed with his capture...""

I'm so happy this TV series has finally made it to DVD.
