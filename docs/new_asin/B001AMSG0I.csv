8300854,5,B001AMSG0I,"I first found Eleusyve Productions 'The Rite of Luna' late 2005/2006 while googling the vague hope that any of the Rites of Eleusis had ever been made into a DVD format. I purchased this DVD and found it to be a theatrical performance per excellence. Tho it may help to have some knowledge of the content and history of the content of the Rites of Eleusis, Eleusyve productions have made this production into a rock opera which makes the content very accessible to the greater public. Remarkable performances by the lead characters, Jon Sewell, Melissa Holm, Daniel Christianson etc are masterful and poignant. I could not recommend this DVD highly enough to anyone interested in Aleister Crowley's Rites and the work of an outstanding theatre company!",1364515200,3,752,4.976190476190476

8300856,5,B001AMSG0I,"There is something inspiring about Eleusyve's production of The Rite of Luna; it produces a feeling of that ineffable and eternal part of nature which is at the core of our very beings. When I watch Luna on DVD or listen to the CD, I feel like I am being initiated into something deep and mysterious. Of all of the Rites of Eleusis I have seen so far, this is by far my favourite.

Whether you are a fan of Crowley's work or merely a literary or musical connoisseur, if there is one artistic purchase you make this year, make it this one. You will not regret it.",1266969600,6,562,4.203703703703703
