8097447,3,B000CCQEUG,"In this romantic action film, the daughter of an Inspector General (played by Athiya Shetty) and the son of a notorious criminal (played by Sooraj Pancholi) fall in love.  Naturally, there is no easy path for such a romance.

From the clips and descriptions, I expected a much more romantic and emotional film, and was disappointed with the actual plot. Shetty and Pancholi, both in debut roles, had good chemistry.  Pancholi was excellent, but I didn't feel that Shetty gave a good performance.  Her unappealing character made a dramatic and unbelievable turn around from spoiled brat to sensitive adult, showing a weakness in story writing.  The fight scenes were well-done, but the choreography and music were mediocre (with the exception of the fantastic ""Main Hoon Hero Tera"").

Honestly, the best part of this average movie was during the credits, when Salman Khan sings ""Main Hoon Hero Tera"" in a charming video.  The movie is worth watching for that alone, but don't expect a great deal from the film itself.",1492732800,,1016,4.976331360946745

8097452,4,B000CCQEUG,"Impressed with this movie made by but not starring Salman Khan. Actors did good job. Choreography looked forced at times, especially the ballroom dancing steps. Loved video at end showing Salman singing the song. Looking forward to more movies put together by Mr. Khan.",1458691200,,269,5.136363636363637
8097453,4,B000CCQEUG,"I thought this was a good movie. The young star, I feel will be around a long time. A good first movie for him. The two stars looked  like brother and sister rather than a pair of sweethearts. Two really strong looks didn't work for me.",1458604800,,236,4.130434782608695
