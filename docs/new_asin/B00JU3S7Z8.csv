6390123,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"This is the season which I anticipated, hated and loved at the same time. The writers did an excellent job at telling the story.  Dana Delany played the role like no other. I was crushed by a couple of scenes which hurt, but strengthened my respect to the writers for the realism. Its funny how you find the hero in a story more compelling as you see the weaknesses and frail moments the character experiences. I shed a tear in that moment of weakness for C. McMurphy.  Wow what an experience watching this series was. Kinda wish there was book.  Any chance of getting the script anywhere.",1412121600,8,589,4.485981308411215
6390124,5,B00JU3S7Z8,Best drama about viet nam. Shows the grit without overdoing the blood. A mash for the 90s without the humor,1412035200,,107,4.4
6390125,4,B00JU3S7Z8,Really glad I waited for all the seasons to come out on DVD rather than spend a couple hundred dollars for the whole box set.  This was for my 83-year-old mother.,1411776000,4,162,4.225806451612903
6390126,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"Season 4- another great DVD of a quality show.

6390129,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"China Beach is seriously a great series, but selling it for $149.95 is robbery. This was probably taken out a a Time Life complete season pack.  Wait until September when season 4 comes out by itself.  It will be worth the wait.",1405036800,12,228,4.404761904761905
6390130,5,B00JU3S7Z8,I loved China Beach then and after watching it again I think it was one of the best shows on TV.  It brought back a lot of memories and the music was great.,1404086400,3,156,3.727272727272727
6390131,4,B00JU3S7Z8,"The best feature of the DVD collection are the back stories of the series. To hear the cast and creator talk about the making of China Beach was worth the price of the set. In addition, the anniversary reunion of cast and crew brought them together for interviews based on their recollections about being a part of something they knew was extraordinary. That they relied on the actual experiences of Army nurses spoke to the realism they wanted portray alongside the dramatic storylines and bits of humor. Both the war and the personal impact on those who were there were poignant and helps the viewer understand that there are no winners in war.",1501459200,,646,4.725663716814159

6390164,5,B00JU3S7Z8,Gift for my Vietnam Vet Dad.  He loves it! Dana does a good job showing how a combat nurse suffers right with the guys.  It hurts to see your guys coming back in all torn up.  You go the extra mile to help them.  This show puts that out there.  The only AW--- was a square parachute in that time period and some other small goofs but a great show.,1447286400,,347,3.9

6390199,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"""China Beach"" may seem like a latter-day attempt to recreate ""MASH.""  It is enormously more persuasive as drama, however, more genuine as human experience.  To accomplish this the writing and producing had of course to be different, but while throwing no stones at the casting of ""MASH,"" that of ""China Beach"" is brilliant.  Dana Delany is the key to a large cast, among whom there are no stars, but many regulars and much coming and going, which is just right for a Vietnam war setting.  ""China Beach"" is the one series I have all of, bar the cartoons of ""Top Cat.""",1428969600,,566,4.574257425742574

It finally did, and I would be a very happy viewer, indeed, if it were not that I'd love to know what the characters are saying to one another.  Thanks to a delightful 13-month tour in Vietnam, and a close call with a buried block of TNT. I don't hear very well, in fact that Navy says about 70 percent of my hearing is gone.  No, I can't hear the birdies any more, or little girls or the tea kettle whistling. There is no closed caption option on China Beach.  Here we have one of the finest series made for television, made indecipherable by oversight or the unwillingness to pay the fee.

I never missed an episode in the 4 seasons the show was on the air and I recorded them all to watch again and again. By the time the DVD's were released, those tapes had long ago worn out. I am so pleased to have this wonderful TV series in my hands again. Seeing the actors in character again, is like revisiting old friends. China Beach is a haunting and emotional TV series that I would recommend to everyone.",1416700800,,497,4.242105263157895

6390242,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"Truly the ""Icing on the Cake"", as this final 4th season of China Beach, wrapped the series up in a very satisfactory manner.  To those who may have read my previous reviews of the other seasons, I was really looking forward to these final episodes.  I served in an Army Aviation unit just an hour or so away from China Beach, during the 1970-71 period.  I was favored to know some of the actual personnel who worked in the surgical hospital there, and in another medical facility across the runway from my unit.  All of those folks deserve many accolades from the men (and their families) for the treatment given to them at those two places of succor.  I wish that all of the people who were around back in the 60s and 70s, who thought that those of us who served were to be treated as pariahs upon our return, would watch this series and reflect upon what they did.  I personally was not treated too badly, primarily because I went straight to Germany upon leaving Vietnam.  I was still wrapped within a mostly military community, and did not need to contend with the BS that was thrown the way of other Vietnam vets.  Of course, we heard what was going on back in the States, and we could empathize with our brothers and sisters on the home-front.  Most of the animosity has died off in today's atmosphere, and I am certainly gratified to see how the troops are greeted upon their return from the Middle Eastern conflicts.  War is not a good thing!  The nation should never do again, what happened in Vietnam, and the veterans of all the actions in which our troops are engaged, should not be blamed for answering the call, and serving.  If blame and anger need to be directed at someone, it should be toward those who felt the need to send our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines into the fray.  I send my best greetings to those with whom I served, and my prayers to the 58,000 plus who were killed in action during the war.  May they rest in peace.",1414108800,28,1955,4.4094707520891365

6390244,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"Loved these episodes.  Nice mix of earlier times, and the times when they were struggling to fit back into the world.  It was an eye opener on how terribly difficult it was for veterans to re-adjust to creating new lives, and letting go of the memories they left behind.  Stellar performances by Dana Delaney, Marg Helgenberger, and the rest of the cast.",1413676800,,354,4.67741935483871

6390246,5,B00JU3S7Z8,"China Beach is one of the finest series about the war that Ive ever watched.
I was especially happy when it was released to DVD.
When the series was on T.V I anxiously waited for the next episode after viewing the one that week.
Dana Delany is absolutely perfect she is a talented and beautiful actress.
And a young Marge Helgenberger was wonderful in her role as the resident bad girl.
This series though a bit short by todays standards has the emotional punch that is so lacking
these days....... ""With the exception of The Walking Dead & Breaking Bad.""",1412985600,6,555,4.56

6390249,4,B00JU3S7Z8,"We watched the entire four year series over a couple of weeks.  I think if we had watched this without watching the other three years very recently, I might have been confused. It does jump around from the early sixties to the later eighties.  It has to in order to wrap up the stories of each character.

It is naturalistic but the writing and the acting kept us watching until the very end.  It is intense and that is all I can say without giving the story away.  All of the emotions you have felt watching the first three years intensify in the fourth year.",1412467200,5,560,4.295238095238095
