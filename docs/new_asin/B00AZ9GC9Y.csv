8559503,5,B00AZ9GC9Y,"I got the DVD based on a friend's recommendation. It's a mini-series, 9 hours long. I LOVED it!

Don't be scared off by the length. The subtitles are excellent. I'm fluent in Japanese, and was listening to the Japanese at the same time I was reading the subtitles (there are a number of era-specific words that I don't know, so I needed the translation sometimes). The subtitles did an excellent job capturing the information and the emotions of the speakers.

This DVD series predates the movie ""Ooku"", and describes the means by which a woman became the shogun. It is a love story mixed with palace intrigue. It focuses mostly on what happens in the confines of the Shogun's palace between the Shogun and her concubines, and to the inner circle of government officials.

I totally fell in love with Arikoto and Shogun Iemitsu's characters. Arikoto is a the temple priest who goes to Edo to pay his respects to the Shogun. The shogun is the only living offspring of the 3rd male Shogun, and that makes her bloodlines paramount. The problem is that she's a woman, and women don't rule publicly. Kasuga no Tsubone-sama is the head of the Ooku, the Inner Chamber, and is responsible for keeping the male Shogun's death a secret and keep the Tokugawa government and Japan intact during the scourge of the red smallpox. Through Kasuga's machinations, Arikoto is forced to stay in the Ooku;  Kasuga thinks he will be an excellent consort/stud horse for the young female Shogun. They are all trapped in their roles by the circumstances forced on the country by the disease. Kasuga is desperate for the female shogun to give birth to a male and continue the Tokugawa lineage. Predictably enough, the Shogun and Arikoto fall in love, eventually, but their journey to love is fascinating. Add in the intrigue among the other male concubines against Arikoto, the stormy relationship between Kasuga and the Shogun, the sad story of Masakatsu, who was forced to ""die"" and be the physical stand-in for the male Shogun in public ceremonies, the desperation of daimyo families that have their daughters dress and act as boys to hide the deaths of their male heirs, and you have a compelling, engaging and fascinating story. I finished the series in 4 days. I was that hooked! Watch this, you won't regret it!

**This is not a samurai drama, there is no sword fighting or battles. The story is the focus, so if you want a more typical samurai movie, this will not be to your liking.",1388707200,8,2466,4.725581395348837
