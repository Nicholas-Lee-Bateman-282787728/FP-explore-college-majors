8459000,4,B0056031NM,"This DVD from PBS is about ""Trauma Journalism"" and the effects it has on the news reports and photojournalists whose work we see on the evening news or on the front page of our local news papers. In the papers and on TV we she photos of people in agony or despair or physically wounded. We turn the page or news program moves to the next subject and the image is gone for us. But for that reporter who was ""on the scene"" or or that photographer who took hundreds more images like the one we just saw, the tragedy does not go away. It's ingrained in their mind.

The producer, director and narrator of the 40-minute film that forms the basis for this DVD is Mike Walter. Now a news anchor for WUSA-TV in Washington, DC, Walter was a news reporter for USA Today and was in front of the Pentagon on 9/11/2001 where he watched the plane crash on that fateful day. It affected him emotionally and he wondered if similar events affected other reporters. He met a photographer who captured the 9/11 World Trade Center crash on film - and nearly died when debris fell on him. And he decided to make a film. Then came Katrina and even more reporters has post traumatic stress disorders (PTSD).  Somehow - and it's never quite explained in the Walter's film - an organization called the Dart Center was formed and every year a group of Dart ""Fellows"" would go to New Orleans to help with the cleanup and discuss their common problems. We hear from a few of the reporters and photographers from the Times-Picayune and other reporters with PTSD, and see images of the disaster left by Hurricane Katrina. The documentary was Walter's therapy but it makes us aware of what these news people we see or read have to go through to do their job. And for that reason this is a film worth seeing.

The DVD adds - as bonuses - a 30-minute video of Walter discussing Trauma Journalism to a class of journalism students. There is also a Teachers Guide on the DVD as a .pdf file (which I have not read).

The film won the Best Short Documentary award at the Cannes Independent Film Festival and has played at other smaller festivals I'm sure.
