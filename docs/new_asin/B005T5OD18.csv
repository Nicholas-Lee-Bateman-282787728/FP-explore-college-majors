8485837,5,B005T5OD18,Just another great dual between Nole & Rafa. The DVD was in perfectly new condition & came in quickly via mail. I'd recommend this DVD to a modern day tennis fan who enjoys a scrappy match on the tennis court.,1357430400,,209,4.25

8485839,5,B005T5OD18,This tennis match between Rafael Nadal and Novac Djokovic is a classic. One of the most intense on court battles in recent memory. With Djokovic prevailing after well over 4 hours and in 4 sets. Get it if you are fans of these tennis champions and the game itself.,1338768000,3,264,4.408163265306122
