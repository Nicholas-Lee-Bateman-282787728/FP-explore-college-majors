8386251,2,B0030Y129G,"Both my 12 yr. old son and I caught ourselves looking at each other at the end of each cartoon with a puzzled and disappointed feeling.  Why weren't these episodes funny like past Spongebob DVDs?  They didn't seem to have much humorous content and all ended sort of abruptly with none of those chuckles we used to get at the end.  I'd be interested in hearing other viewer's opinions after they've viewed the DVD.  It seems like the recipe for humor was lost somehow with this DVD. I finally googled ""Spongebob Last Stand Reviews"" and found that others seemed (in some cases) to comment that this wasn't one of the better DVDs.  I hope this isn't a trend as we have every one  of the DVDs and this one stands out as something gone wrong",1272585600,3,736,4.4148148148148145

JUDGMENT CALL:

My home is ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" mania for my seven-year-old.  For the past two years, he has been a big fan of the animated series and has wanted everything that the character is featured on, may it be yogurt to toothpaste, he is a SpongeBob maniac and thus, he was excited when I watched this DVD alongside with him.  I can't help but think that if my son is this way, I can imagine how in the last decade, parents had to deal with their children loving this animated series and wanting SpongeBob this and SpongeBob that.

My wife have found the ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" a hilarious and fun series.  Especially when interacting with your kids, especially with the family singing along with the theme song.  For the most part, six of the seven episodes have been shown on the various Nickelodeon channels many times but if my son is any indication to how a few young children are with the series, watching it multiple times is not a bad thing for them and they seem to welcome watching the episodes over again.

Overall, if your children or if you are a fan of the series, ""SpongeBob's Last Stand"" is a fun DVD release.  You get the never-before-seen episode of ""SpongeBob's Last Stand"" and six new-to-DVD episodes plus a few entertaining special features including the ""How to Make SpongeBob SquarePants"" which left my son in awe.

If you are looking for a good gift for a your child or a friend/family member's child, looking for a good commute video to keep the kids quiet during a drive, ""SpongeBob SquarePants: SpongeBob's Last Stand"" is definitely a release worth picking up!",1268870400,8,4079,4.994065281899109
