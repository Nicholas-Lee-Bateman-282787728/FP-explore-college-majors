2677715,5,B000JLTRLI,When I was little I had always loved the Valentines episode with the Valentines dance and Captain chipmunk.  I watched it every year.  Now I got to share it with my daughter in DVD format and she loves it too!  Great DVD.  Contains a few other episodes as well.,1262131200,3,261,4.26530612244898
2677716,4,B000JLTRLI,As a devoted fan of the chipmunks I think Theodore is my favorate because we both like to cook and bake foods. I remember watching all of the episodes of the cartoons as long as in the mid 80's. The valentine episode I liked the most is the Captain Chipmunk episode. The other episodes are okay. I'd gives thumbs up! Thank You.,1251072000,5,327,4.290322580645161

2677718,5,B000JLTRLI,"My grandson, who is 4, absolutely loves the Chipmunks and this DVD was charming and entertaining. He was thoroughly engrossed with the whole thing and always asks to watch it whenever he is over. Would definitely recommend this",1209081600,,227,5.0
2677719,5,B000JLTRLI,It's Alvin and the Chipmunks so of course this dvd is good. I was so glad to find that the chipmunks had a valentine dvd because you just don't find kid's valentine movies all the time and the fact it was Alvin and the Chipmunks makes it even more special.,1207353600,,256,4.14
2677720,5,B000JLTRLI,"As always, Alvin and the Chipmunks are as entertaining as ever.  The whole family loved them.",1171929600,3,93,4.8125
2677721,4,B000JLTRLI,"I dimly remembered the Valentine special from childhood.  When I first saw Tuxedo Mask on Sailor Moon, his attire reminded me of Alvin's Don Juan getup, but I wasn't entirely certain it wasn't all in my head.  I'd looked and looked for the Chipmunk Valentine special, and when I finally saw it in a store the other day I couldn't snap the only copy up fast enough!

It's been years since I watched Chipmunks, and I'm a bit startled by the cheesiness of the show, but these episodes are funny and lighthearted.  The first episode is especially charming, as we see a world full of hearts in honor of the holiday.  I recommend the DVD!",1170374400,7,632,4.460869565217391
2677722,5,B000JLTRLI,"Another reviewer was right in that the video had to be changed in order to replace a song that they no longer had rights to.  It's unfortunate, but it happens.  It's happened with several shows.  That doesn't mean the video deserves the harsh rating it was given by the reviewer.  I think it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Alvin's antics are hilarious.  This is one of those classic Chipmunk stories that we all know and love.  I'm going to give it 5 stars to help offset the earlier harsh review, but I would have given it 4 stars otherwise.",1170374400,6,543,4.316831683168317
2677723,1,B000JLTRLI,"I am disappointed in how Paramount has released this DVD. While the art on the box is nice and that we get the following episodes A Chipmunk Valentine, Simon and Dr Heartthrob, Theodore and Juliet, and Dear Diary. Here are the following problems that I found with it.

A Chipmunk Valentine is in Mono sound and the sound is slower then when it was broadcast originally.. Another problem I found with this DVD is in the Theodore and Juliet cartoon.  The song ,Love Potion #9, was replaced with the Witch Doctor. Those that own the original valentine video will know what I'm talking about. I think that it's sad when Bagdasarian productions alters it's own works... I am so tired of music replacements for shows that involve covers. The witch Doctor song does not fit this cartoon IMOO... I just wish that the cartoons were left intact... I thought that DVD was meant to preserve shows... This longtime fan is leftt feeling disappointed....",1169596800,8,939,4.754601226993865

8152172,3,B000JLTRLI,"I have always loved Alvin & The Chipmunks, but my interest began long ago in the comics before the animated cartoons. They do manage to fill their episodes with familiar or new music just for the occassions they are celebrating, and watching them does remind you of the comic style characters which is also an added plus. I just can't get over listening to helium sounding voices for long periods of time. Just like Peanuts, Alvin & his friends seem to live in a world nearly uninhabited by adults and mature voices to offset the continuous chipmunk voices. That is my only concern about the cartoon series, but Dave does appear quite a bit in the scary Halloween cartoons more than the Valentine specials.",1359590400,,706,4.701612903225806

8152174,5,B000JLTRLI,"ordered this from BestBuy.com with te giftcard i got for christmas from my mother's boyfriend.

i love it! I vaguely recall it! but i adroed the three adventures on the dvd my favorite of hte other three was ""Theodore and Juliet"". it was so adorable how he never told her his name was Theodore. he was so nervous in the park that he said Thebo.

I also Liek the one where The Chipettes get their first journals.

in hte valentine episodes i loved Britanny's Dress. I love when Alvin sees his reflection i nthe popnd and tries to beat himself up and this episode is so endearing.

I plan on buying the DVD ""The Very First Alvin Show"" to get the Chipmunk Reunion Episode. Because that's one ofh te episodes i remember.",1295136000,5,716,4.401515151515151
