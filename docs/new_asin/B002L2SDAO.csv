8372363,3,B002L2SDAO,"Ok, so here's another in the growing list of ""extreme angling"" expedition adventure films. Why, you ask yourself, should you care? Well, you probably shouldn't unless you like incomplete fishing sequences, a jumbled storyline and mediocre camera-work. And I'm not just referring to this particular film, not by any means.

If you've seen the teaser don't be fooled, it is much better constructed than the actual film. This is par for the course, I suppose. Think of all the amazing Hollywood trailers you've seen where the actual film has been a disappointment. Not that this was that bad, but the tightness and clarity of the short film (the ""trailer"") is not in evidence in the larger film. For example, in the short version we get a sense of the frustration of the search, the time en-route, the hardships of life in camp, the culture shock of confronting a culture whose sense of pace is vastly different from ours, and, of course, a sense of the huge rewards available to these intrepid anglers if they get it right. In other words, there is a tight, stick to the plot-line (but leave room for interesting developments) organization to it. The feature film tries to stick to this plotline, but gets mired by (what I can only assume) is a lack of footage. This is SOP for these fly fishing adventure teams (witness the AEG boys) where they seem to be so caught up in the actual fishing that they forget that you can't tell a story in film without the footage. In other words, someone has to hold the camera.

Worth the money? Yes. It's a great escape (especially in wintertime) and the scenery, locals, and fishing look fabulous. The heroes of the story almost come to life and the fact that they devoted the final chapter to conservation is great. I guess I'm just a little upset with myself for being constantly seduced by these types of documentaries, hoping to finally live vicariously through these guys.",1296345600,,1913,4.7074626865671645
