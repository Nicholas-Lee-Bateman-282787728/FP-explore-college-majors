4384912,5,B004I9SJFM,"First, I'd like to thank Pearl, jr for her dedication and work in this on-going endeavor.  I found the selection to be fairly all inclusive of the evidence for the possibility of MJ's being alive.  Also, I feel 100% sure that with this man's pure genius, let alone soul, he's the ONLY one who could have master-minded with such perfection his fictional demise.  That's the thing about Michael, he always leaves you wondering and wanting more, thus his timeless appeal!  Whatever comes to light in time, ""Amor Vincit Omnia.""",1302048000,2,523,4.842696629213483
4384913,5,B004I9SJFM,"I am a french Michael Jackson's fan and believer and I appreciate very much this DVD. I think that arguments of Pearl Jr are valid, because Michael Jackson's death is mysterious. She doesn't try to convince us, she explains the facts, we are free to decide. I liked it vey much, it's clear without emphhasis. I recommend it for all who seek the truth. Thank you Pearl Jr.",1301788800,5,371,4.470588235294118

Even if I do not believe very much in Michael's faked death.

Well, we will see!

Ok, bye.

4384915,2,B004I9SJFM,"Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan.  I have bee a fan since I was 10 yrs old and I'm now in my 30's.  I have a huge collection of MJ stuff every video and movie he's been in and of course all his music since the Jackson 5.  I even have tattoo's which were done BEFORE he passed.  I have defended MJ through all his legal battles against media brainwashed people.  When he passed 25 June 2009 I remember where I was and after hearing the news I couldn't function at all.  My family and friends were worried about me because I just cried for days.  I'm actually still grieving MJ's death to this day. I have come to the reality that he is gone but as we all know his music and the gifts he left here on Earth still live on. A new generation of kids have been exposed to the King A Pop. Instead of hearing negative comments and jokes they hear that he was a genius and the best entertainer of our times.  There's MJ stuff everywhere now! When he was alive the only place to purchase MJ collectibles was off of EBAY!

I don't believe he would FAKE his death.  His mother and children looked so grief striken at the funeral. I don't believe he would put his mom and kids through that.  I don't believe he would put his fans through the grief either. Just like the comparison of Elvis and Tupac with the ""they are still alive"" theories it's all stirred up by people who don't want to accept that these talented individuals are gone.

I'm not going to call the people who put this DVD out leeches or exploiting MJ for money. They may truly believe their suspicions that Michael is still alive but as a fan this DVD should not be taking seriously at all.",1301270400,4,1675,4.2
4384916,5,B004I9SJFM,"This DVD is absolutely incredible! Pearl is an inspirational independent journalist and confidently, seriously and directly addresses the viewer at home informing them of Michael's evidently 'faked death'. She provides straight-forward, sensible and convincing clues and credits those who submitted information. She is loyal, honest and has produced a masterpiece and regardless of whether you believe or not, this is the DVD for you. All you need to do is close that warp tunnel that the media have you in and make up your own mind. With this DVD, Pearl wants to be starting something and damn straight, because the truth is lying out there. Pick it up, take a grasp on reality and BUY THIS DVD. Who cares if she doesn't own the content directly. She's on an adventure, a great adventure and the truth is coming. If you want to be in the know before everybody else, BUY THIS DVD. Love you Pearl and Cecil!

4384917,5,B004I9SJFM,"As someone who just recently started researching the possibility that MJ faked his death, this DVD was so helpful and informative. Pearl Jr does an excellent job of providing documents supporting the clues that she lays out. For those people who think that this DVD is a waste of time and money, just move on and leave your negativity elsewhere please. I fully beLIEve MJ is still alive and will make a comeback bigger than anyone is expecting. If that makes me naive, then so be it. I refuse to blindly believe MJ is dead when there is so much pointing to the contrary. Great job Pearl Jr!!",1300665600,6,591,4.481481481481482

So Before All The Criticism Watch The Dvd And Get An better Understanding As to What Is Really Going on! Remember... There Are Two Sides To Every Story, Love You Pearl! I'm With You All the Way. Oh And Another Thing is you guys come just to attack michael jacksons fans, why not let us who are fans believe and enjoy ourselves and you guys who don't believe... maybe go ahead and attack tupac, biggie, elvis and etc. fans and leave michael jackson fans alone this is real!!!!!.

4384920,5,B004I9SJFM,Cmon people quit being so negative. I think it's a wonderful idea that a book has finally come out on the possibility that Michael Jackson faked his own death. If more people would stop for just a few minutes and take a much closer look at why there are believers out there like myself who 100% beLIEve in Michael. The person who wrote this book you are condemning personally knows the Jackson family. The Jackson family knows about this book along with her ebook online. The MJ estate has approved this book to be sold which should tell everybody something. No one has a problem going out and buying all of MJ's music yet when a book comes around that he hoaxed his death you scoff at it. I give kudos to the author of this book and I personally hope more people will go and buy it so they will be able to hopefully open their eyes and see the truth right in front of them MICHAEL JACKSON IS ALIVE...,1298073600,6,901,4.2748538011695905

4384938,1,B004I9SJFM,"I watched this on Netflix, and it was comedy gold. It has since been removed, but hopefully they will add it back into rotation. My feelings about this movie have already been expressed by many others. It is garbage, and Pearl Jr. Has mental issues. I am also fairly positive that she is also the one writing the 5 star reviews, since most of them contain the same grammar and strange spellings of the word ""believer"".
It is entertaining, but you will be mad at yourself if you spend actual money to watch this masterpiece. It has no rhyme or reason, and is narrated by a real wackadoo. However, if you can find it for free, or money is no object, then you should watch this piece of crap.",1390867200,5,689,4.348837209302325

Oh dear lord who I don't believe in, is this awful.  If you fancy a morbid laugh at the simple-mindedness of others at the expense of your own time, then rock on and give this drivel a shot.  I rarely to never write reviews, so masticate on that for a moment.  This woman and her low resolution camera take your probably tired brain down the yellow brick road of fantasy, where the facts get barely a look in. If you want to believe in the idea of Micheal Jackson being alive and can put your sensibilities on pause for however long it is I sat through that, then you might enjoy the show. Equally, if like me and you enjoy the car crash that is conspiracists dim-wittedness then you may also (sort of), enjoy it.  If you're looking for a credible documentary though, you must first remind yourself of the title and instead search for ""BBC"" or perhaps ""National Geographic"" and forget this.

Oh, and prepare yourself for condescending hand gestures.",1352073600,4,1003,4.483516483516484
4384942,1,B004I9SJFM,"what absolute nonsense... the ""proofs"" she offers are so terrible they are laughable. the ""investigative journalism"" is so bad it makes weekly world news (a tabloid she sources in the film as proof) look like barbara walters by comparison.

this is great to watch if you are high and want a good laugh, but if you take this crap at all seriously, you are going to be wasting your money.",1351036800,5,386,4.514285714285714
4384943,1,B004I9SJFM,"This ""film"" is entirely produced by a single conspiracy theorist who has absolutely no factual evidence to back up her claims. After watching this drivel, I can only conclude that this title was released solely for the sake of making a quick buck and/or the Producer/Director/Star of the ""documentary"" is seriously mentally ill. As if it wasn't crazy enough at the time of its initial release, several things have happened since then that make the chances of MJ still being alive even more remote. Especially the conviction of Dr. Conrad Murray, whom the director suggests will likely be acquitted in the event he is even prosecuted. Are we supposed to believe that he, the coroner's office AND the LA District Attorney's Office are all in on such a wide-scale hoax? I'm sure that Dr. Murray wishes this was all a hoax, as he sits in his prison cell today!

As to this person's ""evidence"", it consists largely of what she claims are people acting ""out of character"" after MJ's death, the possible misspelling of his legal name on a coroner's report and a plethora of ""lack of evidence"" of him being dead that is somehow supposed to prove that he is still alive. She even throws-in some kind of conspiracy having to do with MJ having a ""Lucky Number"", and how often the number 7 pops-up in different documents, dates, etc. From a purely a statistical standpoint (i.e. math) this entire line of investigation has absolutely no relevance to anything, let alone establishing that MJ is still alive. This person obviously has no understanding of statistical probability, nor does she seem to want to take the time to perform an actual ""investigation"" that goes beyond showing clips from entertainment TV shows or flashing headlines from the Weekly World News (yes, she actually cites them as a news source!).

Probably the most amusing allegation is that MJ somehow created another body to pass off as his own to the coroner's office. So, in his spare time MJ must have been a genetic scientist who had mastered the cloning of human beings, just to fake his own death! At the very least, the world owes him a Nobel Peace Prize in Physics for this accomplishment.

In a nutshell, this film proves that any fruitcake can sit in front of a camera for 52 minutes spewing conspiracy theories about ANY (dead) person possibly faking their own death and not have to produce a single shred of evidence that backs up their claim. The case made for MJ's death being faked has no more credibility than any average person could make-up about any other, random dead person. If this was really a mockumentary in disguise, it failed to provide any humor or entertainment value. It merely leaves one scratching their heads, wondering how this project ever made it past the drawing board.",1344988800,11,2766,4.7824267782426775
4384944,1,B004I9SJFM,"This video (I refuse to call it a documentary) is shocking, disturbing, and downright scary. Not for the reasons you would think, rather because of presenter. I watched this on Netflix, and you should watch it as well. Unlike other reviewers I will not try to persuade you to spend your time elsewhere. If you are at all concerned/interested in mental health issues and want to see a case that will leave you haunted, this is the video for you. This woman actually believes what she says, and that's the most shocking part. Pick a conspiracy theory; from the Moon Landing Hoaxers to the Birther Movement to the 9/11 Conspiracy people...none of them have anything on this woman.

An hour of painful, wide eyed expressions of smirks and ""I know something you don't"" smiles punctuated with a grasping, almost panicked inquiry of ""Now do you believe?"" will have you on the verge of tears for the illness this woman apparently has. I say apparently because I don't think she's acting, but that is within the realms of possibilities. The music group SOUNDGARDEN once made a video for their single ""Black Hole Sun"", in which a cast of characters often displayed wide, exaggerated plastic-like smiles. The expressions on this video remind me starkly of that video Starting out stronger than it ends, you get the feel like she may have a case, but that quickly evaporates as one flimsy piece of ""evidence"" after another are presented in succession. As you reach for the controller to stop watching, you find yourself not able to escape the train wreck that unfolds in front of you.

As the scenario unfolds, what is presented at first as an investigative initiative quickly unravels into a state of denial and an eerie ""religious fanatic"" like dogma where the presenter tries so hard to make relevant points to plead her case, but instead trips on a flat surface of coincidence and un-relatable events and news bites that will have you puzzled as to how the connections were made. The agonizing conclusion, wrapped up in a ""Jesus returns from the dead"" type of gospel will leave you stunned and saddened that this woman is obviously suffering and not getting the help she so desperately needs. She shouldn't be mocked. She shouldn't be made fun of. She should be pitied, and prayers should be said on her behalf that she comes out of this fog.

I have to wonder if, when the summer of 2011 came and went without the ""return of the king"" that maybe reality finally hit home, and she went on through the final stages of grief. At least, I can hope that is what happened. The production itself is substandard at best, this isn't a ""must watch"" because of any type of value in it's making or presentation. It's a ""must watch"" as a testament to what can happen when something horrific interrupts your everyday life, and your mind cannot comprehend what just happened, substituting instead a slippery slope of hope and belief to calm your fractured psyche. A fascinating display of extreme denial, and what happens when nobody is there to catch you when you fall.",1343865600,12,3048,4.736346516007533
4384945,1,B004I9SJFM,"I can give this a -1 star I would. I was interested so I rented this video on Netflix. It was a waste of time and was such a silly ""documentary"" that was done on the cheap. Watching this film with its far-reaching theories and cheap camera work reminded me of a couple of children doing this film for an English class. First off the presenter asserted that Michael Jackson was alive and his death was faked but then again she goes back on her own information and tries to make conspiracy on how he died. Wait...I thought you said he was alive and now you are stating he's dead but not the way the many reports have stated? I don't know WHO or WHY anyone gave this 4 or 5 stars but I can guess it was the fools who created this crap.",1316908800,4,732,4.090277777777778
4384966,5,B004I9SJFM,"I loved this dvd, I have been following the idea of ""Michael death hoax"" since piano games and maura first started with their very detailed observations and theories on youtube, as well as others, and must admit to me something just don't smell right!!I think Mj was/is an awesome person and due to greed and BS and trusting the wrong ppl got caught up! I think he is/was an innocent man, and nevertheless a very smart business man and knows about creating a scene, what to do to generate money and business to himself as a brand,and how to improve his wealth! ppl often mistake his gentle spirit/kind nature for being naive or think he don't know what he was doing! Time and time again he said he was tough and i so believe him,that he knows how to fight back,and maybe he did this just to show just that!! Pearl hit so many nails right on the head to what i was thinking and even put more evidence,documentation, and more to back her up! Even if you have your own opinion on what happened to Mj as we all do, this dvd does make very convincing arguments that Mj is alive!! Or at least boggle your mind to think is he really dead?

4384967,1,B004I9SJFM,"Poorly produced. Poorly filmed. Poorly edited.

Come along on a journey of mind-numbingly obtuse logic! Travel down paths that stretch credulity!

Firstly, the annoying music soundtrack, obviously meant to instill a sense of mystery or suspense, becomes overwhelming at times and actually makes it difficult to hear what Pearl Jr. is trying to say - not that it really makes too much difference, as what she is saying is usually pure drivel.

The video starts with an explanation that you can't find MJ's tomb on the Forest Lawn Cemetery website. No mention is made of the fact that, just below the search system it is stated that ""It's possible that the person who made the funeral arrangements did not desire family information displayed on the internet.""

Using sources like National Examiner and Weekly World News as proof of conspiracy is nonsense. Weekly World News was famous for stories such as ""Bat Boy Found in Cave"" etc.

Stringing together a list of website domain names which were purchased within a week of MJ's death also proves nothing.

One could go on and on with the inaccuracies, clinging to straws, and other happenstance occurrences which are stringed together as 'evidence' of a hoax.

That being said, there were a few interesting points which do merit some research, such as the faked ambulance photos and the book about MJ's death published the day before he died.

All in all, this video is not worth the money or time. Don't let your curiosity get the best of you. It really, really just is not worth it.",1312416000,6,1532,4.820610687022901
4384968,1,B004I9SJFM,"This is such a waste of time it's absolutely silly.  She is proving NOTHING!!! the sad fact is MJ is dead.  I think he was too sick and tired, drugged and washed up to have the energy, smarts and resources to fake his death.  Faking your death would have to involve the coroner, L.A county police, the judges, officials, LAX security to leave the country....

4384969,5,B004I9SJFM,"I'm sure I will get a lot of flack for this review...but, so be it. I have been a huge MJ fan since childhood when Thriller came out and changed the course of popular music. But, I was not a fan of the ""hoax"" theory. I have a good friend who is a fan and most of us (her friends) have figuratively patted her on the head and simply tolerated this hobby of hers. I simply did not give it one ounce of credence. After watching this documentary, however...I can honestly and without hesitation state that I am now almost 90-100% sure that MJ probably faked his own death and we are all set to witness one of the most monumental media events in the history of entertainment. Is this all bunk and is MJ actually dead? Obviously, that is a possibility. I just don't think so anymore.

A lot of reviewers giving negative reviews are cherry picking tidbits from the documentary to use as strong evidence that Ms. Pear is wrong or is blowing up insignificant details to bolster her beliefs. Such an easy thing to do from the comfort of ones own armchair.

When you confront the vast amount of information that Pearl offers...it's hard to see why one wouldn't at least be asking some questions and wanting to find out more. Too many very strange things are surrounding MJ's death to simply write this off as a kook conspiracy theory. You'll need to see the documentary to get the full details of this statement. I'm still trying to sort out all of the information I was given.

Lastly, I will address the juvenile attempts of some to malign Ms. Pearl's vocabulary and the quality of this documentary. Obviously this documentary wasn't an endeavor that was funded by a big corporate studio. Obviously Ms. Pearl dipped heavily into her own pocketbook to get his picture made. Knowing this, it's not a big surprise that the production would be less than ""stellar"", or comparable to a documentary by Michael Moore or Stephen Hawking. But, thank goodness Ms. Pearl was more interested in INFORMATION...than in producing an award-winning documentary. Her interest is in truth and in information and in answers to difficult questions. Whether the information she offers is truth or not is definitely not the point. The point is...it's her information and it's her research...and it's her belief...and her biggest wish seems to be to get this information out there for people to consider for themselves.

I found the documentary to be very compelling, assembled very good understanding her minuscule budget, and I was riveted to my seat for the entire program. The documentary is available on Netflix for instant streaming, so it's not like she has banked big time on my viewing of her film. I paid pennies to watch it.

If MJ is really dead and Ms. Pearl is wrong...so be it. Nobody is making anyone believe anything. But, you should at least give this film a chance, if for nothing else, just to see what the hoaxers are offering as evidence.",1311638400,11,2926,4.673786407766991
4384970,5,B004I9SJFM,"Pearel Jr has brought some great points up about Michael Jackson possibly being ALIVE. If anyone did this...HE DID!

He just happened to see Pearl Jr's movie on Netflix, and immediately called me after viewing it. To know him you would see he is not an easy sell to believe anything. He now believes that Michael Jackson is possibly Alive, and he also discussed with me things that actually did not make sense to him either in all of this since 2009..like 4 copies of an autopsy that has been released when there is only a need for one. I find this video to be exactly what it states, and a good resource to research on your own to find the answers in all of it. There is more proof out there that points to Michael Jackson being alive, that makes sense then there is of him being dead..Call Forest Lawn in Glendale CA and ask for yourself about MJ's burial site...they will tell you to this day he is not there, and never has been buried there.

4384971,1,B004I9SJFM,"I haven't been a fan of Michael Jackson since Thriller, and I don't usually buy into conspiracy theories. But this documentary intrigued me because I believe Jackson was just bizarre enough and fed up with being scrutinized to do something like fake his own death, so I watched this with an open mind. ""Pearl Jr."" lost any credibility about 3 minutes in. She hangs her specious argument on flimsy bits of information that she presents as irrefutable fact. Among the evidence: she finds it suspicious that Marlon wore an FBI hat the day after Michael died. Not sure where she was trying to go with that one. Also, Janet wore white--not black--to a memorial service, so she couldn't really be in mourning. And although his legal name was apparently Michael Joe Jackson, the autopsy lists him as Michael Joseph Jackson, so it couldn't be him. Right, because it's far more likely that the autopsy was faked than that someone saw ""Joe"" and assumed it was short for ""Joseph."" She lays out a lot of ""proof,"" but my favorite was this (a fragment of her ""seven"" theory): the ambulance and firetruck responding to the emergency call were both number 71, there are 17 letters in Jackson's name, and according to the Office of Personnel (which she pronounces ""personal"") Management (OPM) of Los Angeles, OPM71 is their code for a ""request for leave or approved absence."" This is followed by a cutaway to Pearl Jr., saying ""I'm not making this up!"" Yes, clearly this indicates that his death was a hoax, because I'm sure someone who was busy plotting to fake his death and subsequent disappearance would have taken the time to find and use such an obscure piece of information. Also of particularly ridiculous note are the entire ""seven"" theory, the similarities between Jackson and Elvis (they both lived in a place that ended in ""land,"" for one), and the Band-Aid in the autopsy report. She even uses footage of a Jackson look-alike after his death that she admits was a confirmed hoax--not sure what she thought that would add to her story. Between her absurd and poorly presented arguments and her mediocre grasp of English grammar, pronunciation, and usage, she completely undermines whatever valid points there may be to make, which I now, ironically, doubt exist. I found myself rewinding several times, thinking I'd missed whatever link she was trying to make, only to discover that I had heard correctly and there simply was no link to be made. However, for sheer entertainment value, it's well worth watching--but see it free on Netflix, don't bother to buy this ridiculous documentary.",1311465600,11,2583,4.872727272727273

But the host's tactic of asking questions about innocuous things and then quickly moving on to ask questions about other subjects begins to weigh on the viewer.  By the end, the sheer number of questions was overwhelming, even though each individual question would have had a good, logical explanation had the host bothered to look up the answers.  Why was one of Jackson's sisters wearing white?  Why were his brothers smiling in one undated picture?  Why did Jackson talk about getting away from the press?  Why did Joe Jackson talk about himself in a Larry King interview?  And why is there an undated publicity still of Michael looking through the lens of a camera?  It all adds up to one thing ... murder!

Also the controversy over his middle name.  It's JOE, not Joseph. How many death certificates does one person need? I could go on and on citing examples of things that just don't line up that are brought to light in the documentary. I recommend it for anyone who has even a passing interest in Michael Jackson.

I'm pretty sure that by doing those things, she loses at least some of her credibility.)

This woman takes the most miniscule facts and stretches them to appear as ""evidence"" that Jackson faked his death.  For example: she uses Joe Jackson's self-promoting in the days after his son's death as evidence that Joe knew Michael was still alive.  Here's some news for you: the reason Joe Jackson made those remarks to promote himself is because HE IS AN A-HOLE!

This woman cites newspapers ""The Weekly World News"" and ""The National Examiner"" as credible sources.  Has she ever looked at these ""news"" papers?  Perhaps her next cheap investigation can be about how Bat-boy has escaped again, or which presidential nominee the aliens will back in the next election.

Pearl Jr. does an amazing job presenting the most crucial evidence in a comprehensive, chronological way.  My roommate has been asking questions and she looks at me like what I've just said goes way over her head sometimes.  This documentary explains it beautifully.  I want to thank Pearl for her hard work and dedication in presenting this evidence so clearly.

We did not ask you those who do not believe in Michael for your nasty comments. Please stop writting nasty things and calling Pearl jr. these horrible words. You have no right. Why don't you write to casey anthony and ask her about her little baby that she killed????? and is being set free in 2 days. This is why the world is like this because of the ones that don't know what their talking about. Michael Jackson is a beautiful person who gave to more than 38 charities. he loves children especially his own. Their are people out there that wanted him dead for ovious reasons. HE'S A GENIOUS.I am asking you negative people to please just stop and let us LOve Michael. Pearl is doing this on her own with her mOney so if you don't believe then PLEASE GO AWAY AND BE RESPECTFUL.

Here's an example: MJ said he would end up like Elvis, so that obviously means he faked his death.  That's actually one of Pearl Jr.'s better arguments.  The woman actually cites the Weekly World News as one of her sources - that tells you everything you need to know about her journalistic credentials and integrity.

Pearl jr. is clearly an idiot. All these 5 star reviews found Pearls arguments compelling but fail to mention even one convincing argument, probably because there are none to be found. At best this documentary proves that Michael Jackson was not planning on dying. What a shock! Reminds me of everyone else in this flippin world.

If you are serious, this dvd is not ok. I've seen it and this is not ok.
What about respect for Michael's family and kids in the first place?
Michael is dead and there is evidence enough for it.
For all the people who cant cope the fact he is gone, wake up. Yes I am a huge MJ fan and I am worried about the fact people buy such crap. we all hoped that Mike would have lived on, but it is not.
If you have respect for Mike,
If you truly want to spent money, donate some to charity instead bying this crap.
Michael lives, yes in our hearts and spiritually in the next world.
His physical body rests in a coffin these are facts the rest is based of what if's

They are really scraping the bottom of the barrel to find their so called facts about him being alive however there are no facts at all, just speculation.

Some of their so called evidence is taking what some people say on camera such as family members and other people and taking it completely out of context, it really is ridiculous to watch.

He IS and ALWAYS will be the #1 and I have FAITH that MJ is alive and well and I hope happy, I think the DVD ""This is it!"" is the ONLY clue/statement MJ had to say, he didn't have it in him to do 50 concert tour and again deal with the press and media and everything again. This is what he could offer and his FAITH lies with US now, waiting, watching to see what happens in this world and if any of his life's work will really change the World, and change us!

4385023,5,B004I9SJFM,"Pearl Jr stands for truth and righteousness once again while Michael is on hiatus! What a lovely dvd, it's so nice to have a tangible, hard copy disc to refer the skeptics and cynics to. For the old time believers, it's a wonderful retrospective for us on the anatomy of the hoax, verifying and reiterating things we've been pointing out all along, and for the ""noobs"", newcomers to the MJJ ""hoax"" (more like a long term game plan strategically and beautifully orchestrated), it gives insight; compelling, fantastic evidence in one, single, coveted place. The dvd is cohesive, it's nicely formatted, very fluid and easy for believers both new and old to follow along with and readily understand this huge undertaking that Michael has endeavored and currently endures.

  Pearl Jr has always been a TRUE Michael Jackson supporter, she remains objective and keeps his best interests at heart with her style of journalism, which she exhibited consistently during MJJ's trial (which actually resulted in a prior dvd that you should check out as well which displays how clean, good, and 100 percent innocent Michael is!) Ms. Pearl wants the world to know that Michael is a beautiful human being, both inside and out, and that there is nothing strange going on here whatsoever! In fact, what Michael has been doing makes complete sense and is part of a bigger vision. Michael's mission statement is clear, Pearl's dvd is terrific, and the believers (well, knowers) will remain steadfast while Michael wraps things up; we believeth all things, we hopeth all things, we endureth all things! The musical revolution is nigh! Congrats to all of the hoax community journalists, Youtubers and bloggers, Pearl has taken time out of her busy schedule to compile the community's evidence (coupled with her own moving evidence) into an all encompassing dvd! The ""timing"" is just right!

  Let's continue to spread the word for Pearl and see this dvd go straight to the top with 5 stars! Like the man says, ""THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL"", what a deeply spiritual, creative, and magical journey displaying Michael's magnificent business savvy and miraculous message this has been. Enterprising and deeply loving at the same time! Michael is sensitive to the needs and feelings of people from all walks of life, let's be there for him during his time of testing. Congrats Pearl, Jr! OOOPS, SHE DID IT AGAIN! ;) One of the few journalists with the courage and gusto to speak up and out on the truth! *Sidebar*--there is a great bit on the dvd where Pearl goes in depth about the ELVIS situation, and how it was utilized as a template of sorts for the hoax, good work! Lucky numba 7 and 5 Alive! Keep up the stellar work! Thanks to all hoax community believers and Pearl, Jr!",1302998400,5,2747,4.858974358974359

However, my family did not and they all thought I was crazy every time I brought up the subject that Michael could have faked his death.

When I received this DVD, I immediately got my whole family to sit down and watch it with me. Not only did it expose me to new clues I hadn't found before, it made my whole family completely change their minds about the Michael Jackson death hoax! They are now believers and ever since they saw the DVD, they have been bringing up the subject of MJ's death hoax instead of myself! It's an incredible documentary that will definitely blow your mind. Pearl Jr did a wonderful job on this film! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you aren't a Michael Jackson fan. My brother is NOT even close to an MJ fan and he even loved this documentary and is now a believer. There is information for both believers and non-believers of the MJ death hoax that I don't think anyone should miss out on!

To those who have bought this awesome documentary, I hope you enjoyed it as much as my family and I did! And to those who haven't bought it, I really hope you do! It has fantastic information and clues that will really blow your mind! :)

I have always been a MJ fan and I was so hurt when they announced he passed. But, this documentary has caused me to stop and ask myself, did he fake his death to save his life? I would not be upset if MJ did fake his death. I believe the MJ we knew did die on June 25, 2009. Based on his own diary he said when he separated from his brothers that he wanted to be a new person, separate, he wanted to create someone else along with music. So on June 25, 2009 Michael Joseph Jackson was murdered and he died. But since his real name is Michael Joe Jackson (yes, Wikipedia has it wrong). His mother said she named him Michael Joe Jackson, then who did they autopsy? It wasn't Michael Joe Jackson? I agree with Pearl Jr. take on the court verdict. I went and researched several high profile cases along with other cases and NEVER did the person reading the verdict call the victims Alleged. They always called the victim by their name and that was it. NO other court trial ever said ""The Alleged Victim"".
