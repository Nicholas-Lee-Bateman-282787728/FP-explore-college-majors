1832950,2,B00008AOV0,"Murder By Television, 1935 film

The film begins with articles on building a television receiver for ""ultra short wave"". A corporation must fight to hold its position against the competition. An ""employee at large"" is paid to get results. [Industrial espionage?] Television has tremendous importance for the future. ""Clever these Chinese."" Will television benefit humanity? [It depends on its use.] Mr. Mendoza represents a very powerful group, they do not want the tests to go forward. TV signals are transmitted from White Plains NY. They show Paris and London, then China. [Using low bandwidth telephone lines or short wave radio?] Then Mr. Houghland yells and falls; he is dead! Did someone sneak in or out of the house? Where is the critical tube from the television sender? Somebody broke into the safe in a bedroom and stole the secret papers.

One scientist has a machine that tests a person's brain for faults. One man asks if Houghland was murdered, he has a clue. But Perry is also found dead. There are strange things in the dark night. Did they see a ghost? We meet a Federal Investigator. Can a telephone call cause a death? Yes, it's a ""death ray""! Foreign governments want this invention. The guilty man made a mistake and is identified. ""The eyes can see but the mind won't believe.""

Most people are unaware of the pre-war history of television in the 1930s. This is low-budget film that shows what Bela Lugosi did in movies after ""Dracula"". He was a very good actor who was handicapped by his accent except when he played a foreigner (""Ninotchka""). Was he as typecast as Basil Rathbone?",1330214400,,1605,4.829090909090909
1832951,3,B00008AOV0,"The title of this movie interested me. I did not expect it to be one better science fiction movies I have seen and it was not. However, it was a typical Bela Lugosi, low budget movie, but still entertaining.",1319328000,3,207,4.333333333333333
1832952,2,B00008AOV0,"In 1935, this was cutting edge sci-fi horror.  Produced for less than $40,000 by Cameo Pictures, Bela Lugosi starred in a dual role.  The story and movie, way ahead of its time, was released more than a decade before television became a piece of furniture -- or, ""a cold alter of Satanic light,"" as some called it -- in a minority of America's post WW II homes.

The plot is an oddity to be sure.  A scientist drops dead during the unveiling of his TV system -- his actual death is broadcast live.  No clues turn up in the investigation and the dead scientist's assistant (Lugosi) becomes the prime suspect.  When he too dies, the case becomes cold until Lugosi reappears as a ghost -- or is it some kind of latent, lingering television affect? -- and solves the mystery.

Watch for an early appearance by Hattie McDaniel (Gone With The Wind) and listen for the incongruously ironic song ""I Had The Right Idea"" written for the film by Oscar winner Oliver Wallace of Dumbo fame.",1299715200,,977,4.517045454545454
1832953,3,B00008AOV0,"An inventor makes a TV network that does not need a relay to broadcast across the world. Everyone wants the secret to the electronic tube that can do this. It includes industries and governments and cabals.

During his maiden transmission of piano music, the inventor will reveal a new addition. Unfortunately he is all choked up and the shadow of death crosses the screen. Yep the inventor is dead and everyone that should have been watching the broadcast was elsewhere.  Among the who-dun it's is Bella's twin brother.  We also get the added how was it done?

The film was scratchy and badly cut. The dialog, well lots of talking, but little is relevant to the story.  The plot was too ambitions for the simple conclusion.",1262476800,,724,4.714285714285714
1832954,4,B00008AOV0,It's hard to really enjoy this film because of the print quality.  I love the film but the splices never end.  Bits and pieces of the film are missing here and there.  This is the Alpha edition and the Treeline 50-pack isn't any better.,1259884800,,236,4.318181818181818
1832955,2,B00008AOV0,"... in buying this movie. It is also included in the ""50 Classic Mysteries"" movie set that you can get for under $15 here on Amazon.",1204243200,4,132,4.115384615384615
1832956,1,B00008AOV0,"Bela Lugosi was a wonderful actor and he always put his heart into his performances, regardless of the film's quality. But there are times that I wish I wasn't a Lugosi fans, and one of those times ws when watching ""Murder by Television"". Apart from Lugosi, this movie has nothing going for it. It is dull, even at less than one hour, and the plot is completely uninteresting. And even Lugosi's performance isn't that interesting, since he's given no opportunity to show what he's capable of.

Save your time and money. Re-watch one of his other movies instead. If you really need to see this movie, it's in the public domain and can be legally downloaded for free.",1193097600,2,665,4.635593220338983
1832957,2,B00008AOV0,"This is a dull mystery centered around the inventor of a television system. Suddenly, the inventor is killed right as he is making a broadcast. Whodunit? Prime among the suspects is Bela Lugosi, who plays the inventor's assistant. But no, it's not Bela. We discover him to be just another red herring as he is killed later on in the film. However, all is not lost. Bela's twin brother (?), a federal inspector, shows up and in only five minutes, unmasks the killer. Why couldn't he have shown up thirty minutes before and saved us all this dull talk? Look for Hattie McDaniel in an early role as the stereotypical servant. This obscure feature (it scarcely played any dates when originally released back in 1935) is recommended only for die-hard mystery fans and hardcore Bela fans.",1104883200,3,782,4.757352941176471
1832958,2,B00008AOV0,"In the early days of cinema, it seems like every third movie involved a murder, after which the authorities would not allow anyone to leave the house before the mystery was solved.  Murder By Television is a rather poor representative of that type of movie.  I like my plots to make sense, and this movie kept me rather confused from the very start.  Worse, the final solution to the crime seems to me as if it was just made up out of thin air.  The murder victim in this case is a television pioneer whose plans for a technological breakthrough are in high demand.  As he is broadcasting his message to the few people lucky enough to actually have a TV, he suddenly collapses.  There are several suspects, as one or two of the guests seem to be doing something akin to spying for a rival television company or two.  The inventor's assistant, played by Bela Lugosi, is another prime suspect.  There's another guy who keeps snooping around outside and sneaking in the house, but for some reason I don't understand the cops just keep throwing the guy out the door without asking him any questions.  The ultimate solution to the crime partly relies upon one of the oldest tricks in the book, a plot device that was surely old and tired as early as 1935.  Bela Lugosi is about the only thing this movie has going for it, but his character is by no means interesting.  Almost everyone just seemed to be going through the motions on this one, and the result is a flat, forgettable film.  The one exception is Hattie McDaniel, whom I was surprised but delighted to find in this pre-Gone With the Wind motion picture.  Of course, her character is just one big stereotype, which makes her performance much less enjoyable than it would be otherwise.",1047945600,3,1739,4.553054662379421
7981066,5,B00008AOV0,Bela Lugosi plays his role is excellent. Good movie on time delivery and the source is dependable,1495584000,,97,4.764705882352941
7981067,3,B00008AOV0,"Unfortunately, not a very good transfer to DVD with so-so audio and sometimes jumpy video segments.  I did really like Bela Lugosi in this and it was interesting to see him almost flirty in one quick little scene. The film also has Hattie McDaniel way before her ""Gone With the Wind"" days. The plot is basically about the new business of television with an inventor collapsing (murdered!) on his maiden broadcast.  For a film that is no more than one hour, the pacing is surprisingly slow with a lot of shots of people just looking at each other.  Acceptable B-movie for Bela Lugosi fans but I wouldn't go much further than that.",1488067200,,629,4.598214285714286

7981072,1,B00008AOV0,"Bela Lugosi must have been desperate for money to have allowed someone to talk him into taking a role in this dog of a movie. The nonsense about television allowing the viewer to see what is happening in any part of the world from a studio in their city probably did not sound as preposterous in 1935 when only a handful of people had seen a television or had any idea how it works. People in the movie industry would have known better.

A series of murders take place under the nose of a chief of police who could not solve a crime to save his life. In 1935 any police officer would have known that the police in the film are doing everything wrong. The hapless Chief is not helped by the ""scientist"" who convinces him that a brain scan he had invented (which does not exist now let alone in 1935) could prove whether someone is guilty of a crime or not.

This movie was so bad I could not even stand to finish it.",1467763200,,915,4.163841807909605

7981074,3,B00008AOV0,". . . it has not only Bela Lugosi and Hattie McDaniel--as odd a combination as you can find--but also a fine June Collyer (Bud Collyer's sister, he of radio Superman and TV's Beat the Clock fame).  One star for each of them.  Just be ready to multi-task when they are not on screen.",1404345600,,282,4.203703703703703
7981075,1,B00008AOV0,"Deservedly obscure ""independent"" production that wastes Bela Lugosi, Hattie McDaniel and everyone else involved.
