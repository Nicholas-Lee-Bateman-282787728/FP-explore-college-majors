5344303,5,B009KKLQ54,"Whenever an old back injury wants to remind me that I'm overweight, I pop in this dvd in the morning of the first day, and by the second week,I have more energy, my body is transformed, my posture improved, mental clarity is achieved and my muscles are reconditioned! I would HIGHLY recommend this dvd to any beginner wanting to start an exercise regimen. It is VERY easy to do, and you can accomplish all the motions at your own pace. Thank you, Eva!",1383004800,10,451,4.445783132530121
5344304,5,B009KKLQ54,"What I really loved about this video was that when I was done, I was no longer slouching (at that time!) and my core felt so much better. I am a photographer and carry around pounds of equipment, there is nothing like this video in helping to strengthen those stomach muscles needed! I felt so much better after the video.

She gently guides you through the different poses! So it makes you feel stronger and is relaxing at the same time!!

Highly recommend this video!",1376006400,2,469,4.5058823529411764
5344305,5,B009KKLQ54,"This is a very inspiring professional work out video that leaves you feeling like you have given your entire body a tailored workout.  It moves at an excellent pace and is easy to follow.  Instead of dreading workouts, you will look forward to working out with Eva Bonder's workout video.  An extra bonus is that if you do it before bedtime, it leaves you in a much more relaxed condition and helps to beat insomnia; you wake up more refreshed and fit too!  Check it out!",1375747200,,471,4.441860465116279
5344306,5,B009KKLQ54,"I was originally turned on to this video by my mom, who raved about what a great Pilates DVD it was.  I have gone through quite a few Pilates DVDs, and never found any I liked.  That all changed with Eva's DVD.  I love everything about this DVD- it is filmed in Maui, on the beach, so you get to hear the waves as you work out.  Eva has such a gentle, pleasing way about her, it creates a wonderful space to be in.  I used this video to help me come back from a time when I was very sick, and could barely breathe- by doing this DVD, I was able to focus on healing and getting stronger.  Even on days when I tell myself I don't feel like working out, I get out Eva's DVD and I am right on track.  The exercises are all do-able by a range of abilities,  the setting is great, and Eva is a great instructor.  I highly recommend this video!!!",1371772800,,839,3.9464285714285716
5344307,5,B009KKLQ54,"Perfect for the person who is overweight and out of shape from back surgery.  It was surprising to be able to do every exercise, although I could not hold some positions for very long.  But, I will get there.  My five stars is because I actually enjoy(!) the exercise, the pace, and it is a very good workout without putting my body through more than it wants to endure right now.  Keep breathing!!!",1461283200,2,399,4.424657534246576

5344309,2,B009KKLQ54,It's been years but I took a Pilates class with an amazing instructor so I remember her saying all the time so much of Pilates is the breathe and how to breath during each movement - this video is gentle enough to kep up bit very little instruction on all the rest - if you're a real beginner you'll never know what you're missing and all of that is pretty key,1455926400,,360,4.084507042253521
5344310,5,B009KKLQ54,"This is a great DVD for people beginning Pilates!! I needed something slow-paced and gentle. I feel good when I'm done and I don't feel like I'm going to injure myself because movements are precise and slow. I feel like I'm exercising without killing my body. I actually enjoy this as it's very relaxing, as well!!",1437955200,2,314,4.625
5344311,5,B009KKLQ54,"This video is great for stretching and body alignment.  I had some issues resulting in foot cramps on one side of my body whenever I approached 3000 meters swimming, especially long course when I couldn't stretch my foot by pushing off the wall.  (A problem most likely caused by a postpartum s.i.  joint injury).  This dvd was exactly what I needed!",1436227200,,350,4.688524590163935
5344312,5,B009KKLQ54,"I have been in bed for a year--first due to back problems, then a lengthy recovery from neck surgery in December.  I have just been told that I need another back surgery.  I am forty pounds over weight, weak and terribly out of shape.

When my doctor recommended Pilates I started looking for a tape, and the word ""gentle"" caught my eye.  I am very impressed with this tape--I love the way it was produced: all you see is a woman on the beach.  The woman doesn't try to speak while demonstrating (it is a calm, unseen voice).  The verbal instructions are so clear--most of the time I can just listen and don't have to strain to see the TV.  Of course, I also love the soothing sound of the ocean,

This tape is perfect for me.  It is above my level, and I can't do all of it yet, but I know I will get there.  It is a great starting point.",1431734400,8,839,4.0920245398773005
5344313,5,B009KKLQ54,"Just a little information about me:  fell on my back, was hospitalized for two weeks; also have osteoarthritis throughout my spine; always in pain.  Have developed my own physical therapy plan.  However, I asked my chiropractor what I could do to strengthen my lower back and to provide more pain relief.  She recommended Pilates.  After researching books, DVRs and CDs on the subject, I chose this DVR hoping the words ""gentle"" and ""for beginners"" were true.  So true!  I've learned that it isn't about harsh, heavy duty routines; it's all about consistency and gentle routines.  This DVR fits the bill.  Eva Bondar is an excellent, patient instructor.  She reminds you frequently to keep breathing (sounds funny, I know, but you just forget to breath when you're concentrating on the movement).  Her routines are easy to understand, easy to follow, and most are easy to accomplish.  The ones that are still too difficult for me I just bypass by repeating one other routine until I can attempt the more difficult ones.  You can make your routine as long or as short as you wish.  Additionally, there is one separate routine just for the lower back.  Eva Bondar conducts these routines within range and sound of the ocean.  Now if only I could actually be breathing that ocean air the entire experience would be perfect.  Even so, this DVR is perfect for me and what ails me.  I am definitely experiencing less pain and more mobility throughout the day.  I can't ask for more than this at this time in my life.",1424217600,17,1510,4.7384615384615385
5344314,5,B009KKLQ54,"Excellent for stretching, if you are just starting exercising, if you are older, or if you've been away from exercising and out of shape. The instructor's voice is calm and she provides guidance on focusing on breathing through the exercises--which is very important.",1423958400,,267,5.232558139534884

5344316,4,B009KKLQ54,"I am new to Pilates and thought this would be a great video to get started. After working out for some time, I that I'm more advanced now than this video has to offer me.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start out.",1415318400,4,226,3.9130434782608696
5344317,5,B009KKLQ54,This video is a must for beginners to pilates.  It will help you strengthen your core muscles and increase your flexibility in a workout that is delivered in a calm and low stress manner.  Eva is a great teacher.,1409011200,,212,4.410256410256411
5344318,5,B009KKLQ54,"I was able to attend one of Eva Bonder's Pilates classes in Maui and can say that she is a fabulous teacher. This workout is excellent for beginners, without being fluffy. It is a total body workout, but one that can be done by all fitness levels. I specifically have terrible posture, but could feel a positive difference after this workout. Eva gives specific instructions about how to do each part of the workout so you know that you are doing it safely and effectively. I would absolutely recommend this work out.",1405036800,,517,4.630434782608695
5344319,5,B009KKLQ54,"This is a great introduction to Pilates, suitable even for people who are not at all familiar with the practice and not in the best physical shape. The movements are clearly explained and well demonstrated, with plenty of stretching and conditioning. The exercises are not too demanding but you feel it the next day in a good way, and see results in core strength within a very few weeks.",1389916800,4,388,4.63768115942029
5344320,2,B009KKLQ54,"I feel cheated, because this is the same as her ""Maui Pilates Abs Made Easy"", which I already owned!  I dislike when company's rename DVDs and don't let customers know!  Aside from that, the workout is so slow and gentle, which makes it very boring.  There are many other pilates for beginner DVDs that are far superior.  Would I recommend this?  No.",1389312000,6,350,4.580645161290323
5344321,5,B009KKLQ54,"I am fortunate to attend Eva Bonder's Pilates classes in person and would certainly recommend them.  During the end of her pregnancy and for the next two + years following the delivery of her baby boy, the women of her class had to find a way without her.  This video as simple as it may seem was our answer.  She comes through with expertise that will challenge you even though they are simple enough to do the first time you try.  You may not be able to do as many or you may need to modify but don't let the beginners label fool you.  What is most appealing to me about Eva's instruction is the time she takes with stretching for each exercise to release the muscle stress created when you work hard during the exercises.  You will not be disappointed with this work out, in fact you will make it your own.",1388880000,6,809,4.254901960784314

5344324,5,B009KKLQ54,"This DVD along with coaching by Eva Bondar changed my life!  And this all began after age 60.  Seemed to grow taller with straighter back, flattened belly (well close to flat, okay, not so pudgy), lowered shoulders, and a new zest for more graceful movement.",1384819200,,258,4.711111111111111
5344325,4,B009KKLQ54,"A great way to start in pilates. The video moves at an easy pace and is easy to follow. Eva demonstrates all moves as you follow along to her (or someone else narrating) movements. My husband & I both like it and always feel well stretched and very relaxed afterwards.

There are three segments: stretching/warm-up, abdominals, & legs. The whole video takes almost an hour but we'll alternate between warm-up & abdominals or legs sometimes to make a little shorter work out. Much slower moving than more advanced videos we've tried, but it is perfect for relaxing and learning pilates. You won't get lost. We also like the soothing ocean wave sounds in the background which add to relaxed feeling.",1383609600,2,697,4.808333333333334
5344326,5,B009KKLQ54,This is an all around workout that refreshes your spirit while toning your muscles. Seems so simple but has lasting effects. Perfect for those in-between studio class sessions. Thank you Eva.,1383523200,,191,5.193548387096774

At 60+, i don't want to kill my body, but keep it flexible. This is a wonderful experience. A great accompaniment to my daily yoga, i highly recommended it.",1494028800,,334,4.138461538461539

8542498,1,B009KKLQ54,"If you are not experienced in pilates, this is not for you.  Eva provides ZERO instruction about the core -- why it's important, how to strengthen it, how it should be pulled in during the exercises, or how to do the movements. She does say breathe in, breathe out, and squeeze, but unless you have some training, you will not be doing ANY good.... and in fact, may do yourself harm. If on the other hand, you know how to focus on your core and use it to your benefit, this may not be a bad routine to warm up with if you need a less rigorous workout. The scenery is beautiful and the only sound is that of the ocean waves when she is not talking.",1475020800,2,647,4.094488188976378

I run three times a week and have been looking for a gentle workout that would strengthen my core and help with my pain.  The ""beginner"" Pilates and Yoga videos I tried were all too difficult and aggravated my neck and back.  This is not so with Gentle Pilates!  It is perfect!  I feel so good after completing this workout.  It eases my neck and back pain and works my core.  Great video!",1472169600,5,550,4.376237623762377
