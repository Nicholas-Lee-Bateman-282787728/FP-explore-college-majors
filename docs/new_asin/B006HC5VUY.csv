8498289,1,B006HC5VUY,"This was by far the WORST movie I have ever seen. Not only is the acting and script wooden, the story ends with such a disappointing fallacy, that, if it were a widely distributed film, could severely impact Joe Public's understanding of Deafness, Deaf Culture, and the effectiveness of Cochlear Implants. Even so, as a High School ASL teacher, I am always looking for ASL films. I WILL show the movie to my ASL 4 students, with the caveat that they are to look critically for moments when the film ""got it right"" in terms of ASL and Deaf Culture, and when they got it DRASTICALLY WRONG!",1506384000,,587,4.4953271028037385
