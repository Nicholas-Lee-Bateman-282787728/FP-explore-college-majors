2156041,5,B00049QJSO,We received it before it was due to come in and it was in great condition. The tape played really great and made a good addition to my collection.,1324166400,,146,4.068965517241379
2156042,4,B00049QJSO,"Don't expect any great quality movie like one from the DBZ series, (Broly, lord slug, bojack, etc.) But then again, I don't think they were aiming high when they made this movie. This is definitely a good movie, and don't listen to these bad reviews, they were expecting too much from this movie.

If you do get this movie, expect something like Dragonball, not dbz, or even DBGT. The point of this movie wasn't to make awesome fight scenes, (if it was...i...ive lost all hope for the world) or a great story, it was to make something of pretty good quality, but not great.

Get it, enjoy it, move on, grow older, forget the movie, come back to it 8 years later....you know the story.",1271030400,,684,4.464
2156043,5,B00049QJSO,Wow! This is a great movie. I recommend it to anyone. This movie was so sad I was left in tears!,1270771200,,96,3.619047619047619
2156044,1,B00049QJSO,this was whack well i wasn't really into gt as much as dbz this didn't really have any action in it it was boring and short so if you don't have it don't get it it was trash.,1208390400,,174,3.6052631578947367
2156045,5,B00049QJSO,"Looking at the cover for this movie, I bought it thinking that I would get the proper dosage of over-the-top action that defines DBGT.
  Boy, was I glad to be wrong.
  The cover is simply packed with lies, as to this is not an action-packed Chop Socky-fest. Instead, it focuses on Goku Jr., a decendant of (who else?) Goku, who's trying to find the 4-star Dragon Ball to save Pan, who is his grandmother. Along the way he encounters a hot bluish-green chick who wants to eat him, and teams up with a bully who's tormented him for ages.
  No long, drawn-out fights here, just good storytelling and character development.
  While there are plot inconsistincies (where in the heck are Goku Jr.'s parents?), this is a nice way to end Dragon Ball. Entirely worth the cash.",1186531200,,767,4.588235294117647
2156046,5,B00049QJSO,"THIS IS THE BEST BRAGONBALL MOVIE EVER.  It's more of a flashback to the orignal dragonball manga as far as the style and is very accurate.

arracute-  ANY ONE REMBER GOHAN IN THE VERY BEGINING OF DRAGONBALLZ ok he was an emitonal reck and a wimp sAME GOES 4 tRUNKS IN THE ""HISTORY OF TRUNKS"" MOVIE SO  SAYAN+HUMAN= WIMP UNTILLED PROPERLY  TRAINED so goku jr being a wimp makes sence

get this movie",1159056000,,399,4.397260273972603
2156047,4,B00049QJSO,"I've been a Dragonball fan for a while now, and this has to be the most interesting dragonball movie yet. This brings back the adventurous quality that was found in the ""Lost Episodes"" of Dragon Ball GT, or the Dragonball series as a whole. Its an enjoyable experience, but the main character, Son Goku (Not the one we all know, his Great great Grandson) is a bit of a wimp, which is disappointing to see.

Overall, if you want a good anime experience, or you just like Dragonball, this movie is worth watching again and again",1154736000,,526,4.479166666666667
2156048,3,B00049QJSO,"First of all this isn't a bad movie but it just could have been a lot better. The movie is about Goku J.R the granson of Pan who is a adult now. Pan wants Goku J.R to get stronger and stand up to pepole. However Goku J.R isn't really strong and gets picked on by bullys and gets his stuff stolen. After Pan hears about it she is outraged and tells him to beacome stronger but then she has heart failer and has great chances of diying. Goku J.R decides to save his grandma and goes to find the Dragon Balls to save pan. On the road Goku J.R meets the bully who picked on him after being tricked by a truck driver they seet of to help eachother a meet a lady who lets them stay at her house. But, this lady was really a monster who attacks them but Goku J.R and his friend escape. After being scared to help his friend at a bridge his friend falls after the bridge beacomes lose and dies. Goku J.R is sad but it will take me to long to tell the rest of the movie but the movie dosn't have enough action and a little more bit of drama. This is great if you like drama anmie but if you like action you might want to check out the Dragon Ball GT series. A ok movie but they should make a sequal.",1148860800,,1190,3.9214876033057853
2156049,1,B00049QJSO,I am sorry but this was a somewhat of a disappointment. I wasn't expecting much and i didn't even get that. What i kept wondering was: what happened to Goku jr parents and their parents?...and what happened to the goku jr and vegeta jr that we saw in the future at the end of dragonball GT that was from the future?...this show put more holes and unanswered questions than anything else. *sigh*. For  a basic story it delivered its few minutes of entertainment.,1134259200,2,461,4.554216867469879
2156050,5,B00049QJSO,"This is great. I really enjoyed this and it was really funny. It also proved a good point, with a little help from your friends you can make it. The way Chibi Gokou reacts when Pan gets sick is amazing and the way it makes you feel, it's like your in the Anime. And when  Gokou has to go on the journey to find the dragonball to bring back Pan, it is just an amazing story. I'm not goin to sit here and blah blah my mouth off, go check it out. I give it A+",1126828800,2,456,3.75
2156051,3,B00049QJSO,"I think a lot of Dragon ball lovers have waited for this installment. But when you got to see it, a lot would be dissapointed. It's different from wha tyou would expect from DBZ or DBGT story.

The story tells the life of Goku Jr. Probably in between the end of shenron series and before the Tenkaichi Budokai with Vegeta Jr. The whole story showed that all the DBZ fighter's dead, pan so old (didnt show Goku Jr parents), Goku Jr. been a coward, search the dragon ball, goku show up and tell him that he need 7 of the DB, and then ending.

You would expect some action, but really, not much. Also, instead of a few series which the DBGT offer. This DVD only have one series, I rather get the 13 movie and 2 TV special, which were made by the Toriyama team.

It's nice to see a comeback, but a ratehr weak one. Goku must be sad to see the response.",1113436800,2,848,4.127272727272727
2156052,4,B00049QJSO,"Don't get me wrong I liked the movie alot but it's not as good as some of the previous Dragonball movies.  It is cute though, Goku Jr. reminds me a lot of Goku.  If you love Dragonball like me then you'll definitely like this movie!",1112486400,2,232,4.133333333333334
2156053,2,B00049QJSO,"This is not a great movie , it's not that action packed and all the z fighters are dead and thats what makes it the worst. I suggest renting this unless u want to collect all the dvds.",1105315200,,184,3.8684210526315788
2156054,3,B00049QJSO,"As I see it, the essence of dragonball is ascension to higher levels of consciousness. This film simply lacked the creativity shown in other episodes and films. Watching a descendent of Goku transform to super saiyan for the first time in their life should be an event of epic proportion. In this movie it is nothing of the sort. My summary is this: simple plot, ok fight scenes, and a very weak illustration of ascending to super saiyan. It just shouldn't be that easy!",1104192000,2,470,4.607142857142857
2156055,4,B00049QJSO,"This is an intersting piece of work in that it is a Dragon Ball Movie but the story takes place decades after GT ends.  It is also light on action and more in tune with some comedy and story telling.

The story here is that it has been nearly a century since GT ended and Goku went to train with Shenron.  Pan is now an old woman who is raising her grandchild Goku jr.  Goku bears an uncanny resemblance to his ancestor but lacks his courage (much like a young Gohan).  Goku gets bullied at school and does not stand up for himself.  One day while Pan is lecturing Goku on how he should stand up to those bullies she suffers a heart attack.  Goku fearing the worst decides to journy to Mount Pao to find the Dragon Balls and wish Pan healthy again. Along the way he faces off against some evil demons, gains some friends, and even brings out his hidden powers (aka Super Sayin).  In the end all ends happily as he meets his Ancestor Goku and learns of what real courage is and what his future could hold.

This is a simple movie that like I said is light on action and is more about telling a good story.  Goku is a lovable character and the villians, although weak compared to what his ancestor faced off against numerouse times prove menacing enough that they are decent foes.  Overall this is one of the better Dragon Ball movies and comes recomended.  However if you watch them for the action then you may want to avoid this one.",1102982400,29,1433,4.266666666666667
2156056,4,B00049QJSO,"this dvd was okay. the plot is starts when Pan gets a stroke, ends up in a hospital and could possibly die. then, goku jr. finds out that in order to save pan, he must travel to where goku (the original) lived to get the four star dragonball. this is okay but does not have any of the classic dbz action. o well, hope they make a better one.",1101772800,3,341,3.9565217391304346
2156057,5,B00049QJSO,"I've seen the Japanese version of this film, and couldn't wait for it to be dubbed into english.

100 years after Goku leaves Earth, his Great Great...well, you get it, Grandson, Goku Jr., has to set out on a quest to find the 4-star dragonball, which he believes will help his sick Grandma.

Even though Goku Jr. is a complete coward, you have to fall in love with him.  He's absolutely adorable, even when there are tears and snot running down his face, and pee running down his leg.  He finds out at the end that he does have courage when he needs it, and proves that the power of the Super Saijin will never die.",1101081600,3,616,4.2844827586206895

8036015,2,B00049QJSO,"I was disappointed. I know GT was literally made as an experiment for Toei to keep the Dragon Ball hype train railing in the money. This special is the worst of that metaphor as this was created as a ""sequel"" to GT, lacking all of the originality that the first 2 series' was seeping with.",1451952000,,289,4.2727272727272725
