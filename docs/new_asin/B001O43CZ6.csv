8329333,5,B001O43CZ6,"Masters of Cinemas sumptuous DVD box Late Mizoguchi contains 8 of the 9 films the great Japanese director Mizoguchi Kenji made for Daiei between 1951 and 1956. It has given me much pleasure over the last decade and I have no hesitation pronouncing it THE best DVD purchase I have EVER made (and thats coming from somebody who buys a lot!). The box consists of 4 duel cases which have all been released separately, each one containing one jidaigeki (period drama) and one gendaigeki (modern day drama). Not only have all the prints of the films been beautifully remastered, transferred flawlessly and look absolutely exquisite, but each disc comes with informative video introductions by Tony Rayns and hefty booklets. The booklets include articles on the films by Keiko I. McDonald and Mark Le Fanu (authors of authoritative books on the director) in addition to English translations of the source material for all the jidaigeki we are given. Those into cover design will also enjoy the original colorful Japanese posters for all the films on the reverse of each inlay card. The presentation really couldn't be bettered and I recommend you get the 8 DVD box as all 8 films are unmissable for anyone who cares about film as an art-form. If you cant get the box then you can pick the 4 cases up individually. As I write I notice that both the box and the cases are all currently very expensive, sure sign that MoCs license has run out. Best buy now before they disappear forever. I notice some of the titles are available for streaming into your computer, but the quality of the image won't be the same and you would be denying yourself the fabulous documentation that comes with the MoC discs.

The third case consists of Uwasa no Onna and Chikamatsu Monogatari, the fifth and sixth films Mizoguchi made for Daiei. Uwasa no Onna is a beautifully crafted and engrossing gendaigeki about the relationship between a brothel owning mother and her daughter who struggles to escape the disrepute that clouds her family name. Chikamatsu Monogatari is an extremely polished jidaigeki conflation of an early 18th century joruri puppet play by Chikamatsu Monzaemon called The Almanac of Love with a late 17th century short story by Ihara Saikaku on the same material called What the Seasons Brought the Almanac Maker. The film is a tragic/triumphant story of forbidden love and features some of the most beautiful and moving scenes Mizoguchi every directed. Underrated by Western critics (including Tony Rayns here), the film is celebrated by many in Japan as one of his most perfect achievements. The booklet contains excellent articles on both films (McDonald on Uwasa and Le Fanu on Chikamatsu) along with full English translations of the Chikamatsu and Saikaku source material. I review both films in what follows. Please note these are thematic reviews in which spoilers are inevitable.

UWASA NO ONNA (The Woman in the Rumour, aka The Woman of Rumour)
(1954, Japan, 84 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)
From 1952 to 1954 Mizoguchi was at the peak of his career, winning awards three years in a row at the Venice Film Festival for his renowned jidaigeki, The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu Monogatari and Sansh Day. Lauded by the critics of Cahiers du Cinma and by critics at home (albeit for different films and different reasons), the director could quite justifiably see himself on top of the world at this time. 1954 in particular was an extraordinarily busy year which saw the completion of three films, Uwasa no Onna sandwiched between Sansh Day and Chikamatsu Monogatari. Sansh Day won the Venice Silver Lion and was placed 9th on Kinema Jumpos Best Ten for the year. Chikamatsu Monogatari won numerous domestic prizes (including the Art Recognition award from the Ministry of Education) and was placed 5th by Kinema Jumpo. Uwasa no Onna won nothing and was placed nowhere. It is the least successful of Mizoguchis gendaigeki womens melodramas which focus on ladies entertaining/enduring men in houses of pleasure. The reason for this is hard to fathom for he was working with most of his favorite people  the actors Tanaka Kuniyo and Shind Eitar, the art director Mizutani Hiroshi, the cinematographer Miyagawa Kazuo, and his regular screenwriter Yoda Yoshikata. This should have been every bit as successful as the previous years Gion Bayashi, a film which it resembles a lot. Perhaps Mizoguchi was still smarting at the memory of Daiei interfering with both Ugetsu Monogatari and Gion Bayashi and was loathe to repeat the process, especially as the film initially came at him as a request from Daiei. Perhaps he was upset by the tension simmering between himself and Tanaka which would eventually lead him to prevent her directing a film set up by Naruse Mikio and Ozu Yasujir, an action which ensured Uwasa no Onna would be the final film of their 15 year/15 film collaboration. Rumours in the press had it that Tanaka had been the love of Mizoguchis life and that the sour grapes exhibited by him during the making of the film evidenced the fallout of her rejection of his romantic advances. People speculate on with no clear answers, but the fact is, Uwasa no Onna is a very well-acted, beautifully crafted melodrama which is certainly well-worth watching, but basic structural flaws (which ordinarily Mizoguchi would never have countenanced) prevent it from really taking off as both Sisters of the Gion (Gion no Shimai, 1936) and Gion Bayashi undoubtedly do. Where these two films provide razor-sharp x-ray views of a whole society in motion, Uwasa no Onna flounders on clunky over-obvious melodrama and unbelievable character motivation which is especially damaging towards the end. That said the film is well worth examining as it fits in so completely with Mizoguchis worldview.

Like every characteristic Mizoguchi film, Uwasa no Onna centers on the key theme of women unfairly used and abused by patriarchy. Behind this pervasive theme lies a dichotomy between the Mizoguchi who attacks this social inequality with a series of narratives which indict men while eulogizing the strengths of women, and the Mizoguchi who endorses patriarchy by using and abusing women himself both professionally and in his private life. A voracious life-long devourer of geisha and prostitutes, Mizoguchi famously broke down when visiting the prostitutes ward of an saka hospital while preparing Women of the Night (1948). He told the patients, If you are here, its the fault of menIts MY fault too! Fueled also by other private circumstances (his beloved sister Suzu being sold off to virtual geishadom by his hated father, his education being funded by Suzus rich patron, his wife Chieko sinking into [some say] syphilis-induced insanity in 1941 while he worked on The Loyal 47 Ronin without ONCE taking a day off to take care of her), this dichotomy which stirred up so much guilty personal antagonism is most likely the creative well-spring for the incredible richness that feeds into the two kinds of film that he was synonymous with, the jidaigeki folk tale legend and the gendaigeki womens melodrama.

The handling of women in both these forms is fundamentally different. As Dudley Andrew says in Mizoguchi a Guide to References and Resources (G. K. Hall, 1981), the jidaigeki are legends of women who suffer for an idea of culture that the film valorizes at the end. The inequality between men and women is part of a cosmic friction which just is  it is a metaphysical given which artists like Mizoguchi can show, but cannot change. The suffering of women is a necessary feature of social existence which humanizes/determines civilization as it has come down to us. The jidaigeki show history as having been made with womens suffering put into the context of this inevitable process. The gendaigeki on the other hand show history actually in the making where [Mizoguchis] heroines are in revolt against a system in which they are exploited, frequently without the aid of even the most fragile family support (Andrew). In the postwar democratic exposs (My Love Has Been Burning, Portrait of Madame Yuki, Oy-sama, The Lady From Musashino) women of isolated social position are brought tumbling done by the iniquities of patriarchy in a modernizing society, and in the films focusing on women without social position trapped in geisha houses, brothels or simply on the street (Women of the Night, Gion Bayashi, Uwasa no Onna, Akasen Chitai), they are forced first and foremost to rely on each other. What arises in these films is an instinct for salvation through generosity toward fellow women in revolt against the city of men (Andrew). This revolt is usually cast as a clash between two ways of dealing with patriarchy, the first through meek traditional submissiveness and the second through radical rebellion and an attempt to play men at their own game. Sisters of the Gion, Gion Bayashi and Uwasa no Onna all center on the relationship between two women, the older one embodying tradition and the younger one rebellion. All three narratives spin around the older wiser woman seeking to control and look after the younger one, and in all three the conclusion is the same, that whether a woman complies submissively or rebels, patriarchy crushes them anyway to the point that the only thing they have is each other. There is always pathos in the older womans position as she is resigned to accepting a fate which she knows cannot be avoided whilst delicately trying to make her younger charge aware of it.

In Sisters of the Gion the two ladies in question are sisters working as geisha, the older one following the traditional path of giri (obligation), and the younger one following the modern path of ninj (personal inclination). Both paths are shown to be equally fruitless as both ladies are crushed. In Gion Bayashi the two ladies are a kind of mother-daughter team, the older one in effect adopting the daughter of her deceased best friend. Again giri and ninj are pitted together and again both are thwarted by patriarchy, the only difference being in the character of the younger one. In Sisters of the Gion Omocha (Yamada Isuzu) is a ruthless bitch who attempts to play men at their own game while in Gion Bayashi Eiko retains a degree of feminist fight, but diluted by innocence and naivety. In Uwasa no Onna the two ladies are mother-daughter, the traditional mother Hatsuko (Tanaka Kuniyo) seeking to control and guide her rebellious daughter Yukiko (Kuga Yoshiko). The difference between this film and the other two is a question of milieu. All three take place in Kyts Shimabara district, but while the other two are set in geisha houses, Uwasa no Onna takes place in a high class brothel. Hatsuko was a celebrated courtesan in her day and now she is the madam presiding over a number of younger courtesans in her establishment named Izutsuya. Mizoguchis final film Akasen Chitai (Street of Shame, 1956) takes place in a low class brothel so we can see a very conscious documentation on the directors part of the various grades of houses of pleasure with an emphasis on their decline from the sophistication of the geisha profession to the crude functionality of sex establishments. Another way to look at these films would be to see a circular pattern in the postwar films. Mizoguchi made Women of the Night (1948) which was essentially about prostitutes working on the street without the protection of houses and he moves from a geisha house (Gion Bayashi) to a high class brothel (Uwasa no Onna) to a low class brothel (Akasen Chitai) and then back out onto the street. Central to Akasen Chitai is an ongoing debate in parliament about abolishing prostitution and indeed this became fact soon after the film was released. Prostitution never dies of course, the legislation simply driving women out onto the streets in the situation we see in Women of the Night where they are subject to violent pimps, police brutality and lack of access to regular medical inspections. The point throughout all these films is that though Mizoguchi may appear to take a feminist stand against patriarchy with the geisha/prostitute in revolt against the city of men highlighted with the greatest empathy, patriarchy itself persists and remains pervasive as a central truth in the world he depicts. Indeed he remained a part of this patriarchy until the day he died.

As in Gion Bayashi, patriarchy looms over both women in Uwasa no Onna from before the film begins. Hatsuko is proud to own her own establishment and to provide Yukiko with a decent college education. She runs her business well, treats her girls with respect and is outwardly content. However, her business isn't respectable and she longs to escape the stigma of being a brothel madam. She has been attempting to buy this respectability by marrying her young lover, Dr. Matoba (tani Tomoemon). She schemes to buy a house for him to use for his practise, expecting him to marry her in return. A doctors wife is the height of respectability for a woman in Japanese society even now, and she yearns for the position. Key here is that a womans respectability hinges not on her own personal graft, but on the position of her husband. Another man named Harada (Shind Eitar) would like to marry her (and is ostensibly a much better match), but working in the entertainment business himself his position isn't high enough to raise Hatsuko from her low station. To gain respectability women are is at the mercy of respectable men of social position. They cannot win respectability on their own. The stigma of her livelihood is made visual in the situation of her daughter Yukiko who returns from Tky at the films opening having attempted suicide there. We gradually learn that her fiance broke off their planned marriage when he learned that his future mother-in-law is a brothel-keeper. Yukikos whole future prospects are therefore blighted by her background even though Hatsuko has always attempted to separate her from it. The film is set out basically as a conflict between mother and daughter with Dr. Matoba as the catalyst for the inevitable explosion. The mother wants to follow the correct social path of marrying into respectibility while the daughter wants nothing to do with Itzutsuya and wants to escape back to Tky with the very man her mother wants to marry.

The central emotional triangle is intriguing and the first half of the film successfully conveys the fractures that split these people as well as the emotional glue that binds them together. Courtesy of fine acting and delicate treatment of interior mise-en-scne Mizoguchi makes each of the these characters sympathetic and fully rounded though it is admittedly hard to like the typically weak vacillating Mizoguchian male in the middle who affects love for both women, but really only cares about himself. We admire Hatsuko for the way she runs her establishment, attempts to raise Yukiko and cares for her employees. Tanaka Kuniyo is perfectly cast being admirably equipped to play both the hard business-woman (treating her customers and scheming to get Matoba to commit to her) and the vulnerable woman who has been trapped in disrespect all her life and is finally so close to escaping it, and yet still so far. Kuga Yoshiko does well with a role which starts off neurotic and withdrawn, thaws out courtesy of Matoba and a closer interaction with the courtesans, and then finally grows protective of her mother. Its certainly not her fault that her characters actions become implausible at the end.

The most successful scenes come in two trips to the Noh theater. The first has Matoba and Hatsuko sitting next to each watching a dance. He is entranced by the beauty of the ladies and avidly ogles them, checking his programme for their names. Hatsuko meanwhile scolds him and eventually rips the programme away from him inducing a peach of a sulking look. This is followed up by a kygen performance in which an old woman (obviously representing Hatsuko) makes herself ridiculous by chasing a young man with hilarious consequences. Matoba and Yukiko laugh aloud as Hatsuko feels humiliated. She draws the obvious conclusion  Young people should go with young people, and eventually magnanimously gives Matoba to Yukiko along with the money she has borrowed for the house he was supposed to buy for his practice. In this interaction of real life with theater (actually a standard Mizoguchi practice going back to saka Elegy [1936] which had an inserted Bunraku performance) the director gets effectively to the core of the drama in hand. We feel for Hatsuko here more than at any other point in the film precisely because Mizoguchi's engagement with his material is so tangible at this point.

His engagement becomes altogether more detached in the second half. First there is the unconvincing way Yukiko is accepted by the courtesans of Izutsuya. At first they are separated from Yukiko and a few of them make disparaging remarks about her snobbery and her looks of contempt thrown their way. Then when one of their number (Usugumo) becomes sick Yukiko takes care of her and suddenly all the girls are won over into liking her. It is a cheap obviously scripted trick and feels entirely fake in the face of real human emotions and Yukiko's supposed hatred of the place and wish to leave. Then later after the doctor has dismissed himself and mother and daughter come together for mutual support (a sequence of convincing well-thought-out scenes) it seems Mizoguchi and Yoda didn't know how to finish their film and so resort to one of the oldest cod-melodramatic tricks in the book  the mother falling sick to bring the errant daughter to heel. This clunky melodrama would look out of place on stage let alone on film and to make matters worse, Yukiko is shown to change her character completely by taking over Izutsuya and becoming the new madam of the house. This makes nonsense of the main conflict of the film which has the traditional mother fighting patriarchy the accepted way and the radical daughter fighting patriarchy by renouncing it completely. Her final caving in is an extremely unlikely change in character motivation and leaves us unsatisfied as the film finishes. There is none of the poignancy of Gion Bayashi here, none of the double-edged tension which has women helping each other but still under the cosh of male power. Here it seems Yukiko conveys respectibility onto Izutsuya  her mothers battle to marry into respectability (as well as Yukikos own burning desire to escape) seem to have been no more than storms in the proverbial tea-cup. Fortunately Mizoguchi went on to make a much better film about women of the night which doesnt for one second compromise his hard view of women united in revolt against male dominion  the valedictory Akasen Chitai. That film seized his imagination in a way Uwasa no Onna obviously did not.

CHIKAMATSU MONOGATARI (A Tale from Chikamatsu, aka The Crucified Lovers)
(1954, Japan, 102 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)",1488240000,,19066,4.955298530790873
8329334,5,B001O43CZ6,"""The crucified woman"" is probably the most personal and heart-beating portrait around an impossible love.

Yukiko is a studied woman, daughter of the regent of a brothel. Her mother is a first class attendant respect her customers, high top managers who spent their money to have a good fun. She is disillusioned because of the fact her fianc knew about her origin. And so the break of this compromise will leave her into a state of desperate hopeless and deep melancholy.

A friend of the family, a handsome doctor is secretly in love with
Yukiko, without realizing himself her mother loves him. He works out as a spiritual adviser for helping Yukiko to get out from that horrid depression. But when one of the working girls dies of cancer, she experiences a sudden twist of fate respect these abnegated women who live under a world of shadows but keeping that naive approach respect the life. On the meantime, she realizes her mother loves him and she decides to conclude this raising and promising relationship, that eventually would lead both of them to Tokyo because he planned to make a post grade and eventually to give his life a twist.

Kenji Mizoguchi depicted this haunting and poignant film keeping into account his own personal experiences about this underworld and the anonymous human beings who live inside it.

Another masterwork in the fruitful artistic trajectory of this remarkable director.",1244851200,,1410,4.936708860759493
