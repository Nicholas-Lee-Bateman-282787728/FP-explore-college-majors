8064630,5,B0009OUBFQ,This is a very good movie if you  are interested in JFK.  Would recommend.,1271203200,,74,4.214285714285714
8064631,3,B0009OUBFQ,"This series was originally on public television, and the original story encompassed JFK's life from childhood through his election to Congress.  This DVD was a disappointment as it begins at the period just prior to WW2, leaving out some fascinating material dealing with Old Joe's ambassadorship to Great Britain, which was a fiasco, and other interesting components of JFK's early life.

Setting that aside, this one is worth owning and viewing.  It gives a balanced view of the famous ""PT109"" incident, as well as of JFK's first run for Congress.  Just know that this DVD is not the complete ""JFK: Reckless Youth"" series.",1135296000,2,624,5.029126213592233
8064632,1,B0009OUBFQ,"Previous reviewer is correct, this release contains only the second half of the mini-series. The box clearly states 183 minutes, yet the one disc contains only 91. It should have been a two disc set. Someone at MPI really blew it on this one. The film film itself is not bad...",1128643200,12,277,4.450980392156863
8064633,1,B0009OUBFQ,"This much delayed release of the 1992 mini-series is one that I hade long awaited. However, my expectations have turned to dismay as the disc appears only to contain the second half of the show.

Despite the packaging and disc listing a running time of 180 minutes, my copy, purchased in Cambridge, Mass, runs for merely 91 minutes.

Inquiries to the manufacturer have proven to be less than helpful, and I am therefore unable to recommend a purchase of what should have been a welcome addition to the DVD market for this title.

I look forward to the rectification of this over-sight by the disc manufacturer, but fear that it may be a long time coming.",1126915200,11,654,4.620689655172414
8064634,1,B0009OUBFQ,"Campus flick where he teaches everybody the 'cool, new dance' he got from a National Geographic type show? Okay, I'm just saying Patrick Dempsey? Uber-nerd from the 80s? As JFK? Well, I'm quite sure he's buried his past in film to be the right man to play JFK. Okay, just as long as JFK doesn't give money to the most popular girl in school so she'll look like she's dating him. Who knows - maybe Kirstie Alley will appear as Marilyn Monroe, so Patrick and her can have a 'comic-reteaming' after another movie they did in the 80s (Loverboy). Okay, okay, just as long as JFK doesn't hit it off with one older woman, and through the grapevine, become a gigolo of sorts who just talks to and dances with the older women - you know, what gigolos did in the 80s. It was all so watered down. Just like this. You've been warned!",1126742400,,821,4.337662337662338
