2653387,5,1607811324,"I've ordered two or three videos of the Grand Canyon, looking for something that would capture the grandeur of this place - and all were disappointing. This one, however, does the trick. There's not much talking during the video, just wonderful music and extraordinary photography that lets the Grand Canyon speak for itself. I think I'll be able to watch this beautiful video time and time again. I can't imagine getting tired of it.",1321056000,16,434,4.878378378378378
2653388,3,1607811324,"This is a great idea, poorly executed.  The scenery is terrific.  The rafting and dory shots are breathtaking.  The music ranges from great (Dvorak and Chopin) to tripe (Weber).  The trouble is that they don't go together.

The only music selection that came close to matching the video is The Moldau (duh).  And even then the video goes against the current, back upstream and up tributaries while the music flows on down towards the sea.  But who would think of putting raging rapids to placid Satie, or the yawning chasm of the Grand Canyon at noontime to a Chopin nocturne?  Pelias and Melisande to waterfalls?  Whoever paired the music with the video either doesn't get the music at all, or has a vastly different emotional response to the scenery than most folks I know.  Whether you like Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite or not, at least that music is emotionally congruent, if not equivalent to the scenes he portrays.  To be fair, finding the right music for the Grand Canyon is probably a lot more difficult than for other famous parks and landmarks (think Grand Teton NP and R. Strauss Alpine Symphony).  There's plenty of room for someone to do it better, though.",1318896000,2,1168,4.727722772277228
2653389,5,1607811324,"We have been to the Canyon three or four times but have never seen it's true beauty due to weather conditions.  It's so vast that it's almost impossible to process.  The photography in this DVD is gorgeous and the music added so much to our enjoyment.  We liked it so much, we sent a copy to friends from Australia, whom we met on a National Parks Tour.",1318896000,7,353,4.2388059701492535
2653390,5,1607811324,wonderfully done dvd.  music accompaniment enhances the visual experience of nicely crafted images.  Highlihts many of the exceptional venues in the canyon.  Felt like I was back there again.,1317859200,4,191,5.517241379310345
2653391,5,1607811324,"If you have never been to the Grand Canyon but have always wanted to, this is the DVD for you! I have not been there, but have seen many still pictures taken by professional photographers. The photographs are great, but one cannot hear the rapids and waterfalls or the beautiful classical music, which I love. Video is taken from the top of the rim, flying overhead, to the bottom of the canyon where the Colorado river flows and visitors in boats ride the rapids. (It is amazing that the gear and supplies loaded in the back of the boat never move, although the people do.) Sunrise to sunset through all four seasons, one sees the amazingly varied vistas while listening to wonderful, carefully chosen classical music. The music cadence moves perfectly along with the scenery, especially the rapids. Some of the composers are Vivaldi, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky and Brahms.  I watch this film often both to view the scenery and listen to the music. I now feel I have had the experience of visiting the Grand Canyon even though I did it in my own living room.",1312675200,30,1052,4.655913978494624
2653392,5,1607811324,"We never get tired of watching and listening to this tribute to the Grand Canyon. The beautiful photography and well-matched music provide hours of soothing, relaxing video.

2653398,2,1607811324,"I'm planning a visit to the Grand Canyon, so I was disappointed with this DVD.  It should have been titled River Serenade, because there was a lot more footage of the river, white water, and boats on the river than there was of the Grand Canyon itself.  One particular boat appeared over and over again and seemed to be the star of the show.  The scenes of the main part of the canyon were few and short, while river scenes were many and long.  Much of the photography was shot into the sun with lots of glare, and much of the photography was not completely sharp.  There also seemed to be more scenes of the billowing clouds and sky than of the canyon.  This DVD could and should have been much better; but it was not what I expected based on the title.  On the plus side, the music was nice.  Not recommended.",1428624000,7,811,4.254901960784314

There is no commentary, but there  are titles of both location and music.  Locations you would never probably ever be able to see are presented as well as the rafting/boating shots.  Such beautiful waterfalls! Bonus segments very interesting.

This is a remarkable National Park treasure and this video shows you why.",1391212800,,267,4.32
2653410,5,1607811324,This DVD not only is beautiful but the classical music played throughout the presentation adds to the enjoyment of the DVD.Also I was pleasantly surprised to find a second DVD included with the DVD ordered.

2653414,4,1607811324,"What a stunning range of filming this is .For anybody contemplating on whether to explore this great wonder and wanting to take a trip to this great place this DVD has what you need to get the feel of being right there in the moment for you. The only thing I was a little bit disappointed with was the classical music in the background. I bought this DVD in the hopes to learn something about The Grand Cannon but it wasn't to be. If you are looking for a docco on this great place this is not the DVD to buy, however, if you would like to admire its true beauty without the education this DVD is for you, truly stunning stuff.",1376784000,,627,4.147540983606557

2653425,5,1607811324,"A friend had played the DVD for us before we went on our 7 day rafting trip through the Grand Canyon.  When we returned, I purchased one for each member of our family who went with us on the trip.  We love the video, the beautiful music and the commentary.  After we returned from the trip and watched it again, it was much more personal and meaningful.  I ordered  4 copies of the DVD and it came in a reasonable timeframe - but the package was open and poorly wrapped so that the DVD's could have fallen out.  Amazing that it got to me somewhat intact .",1345334400,,555,4.140186915887851
2653426,5,1607811324,"This is an excellent video, plain and simple.  I am a stickler for good camera shots, good focus, and I am particularly  partial to crystal clear cinematography.  Make no mistake about it; this is certainly NOT shot in HD.  In certain scenes, you can see the tell-tale ""white-spots"" suggestive of the use of old-style film.  But that makes NO DIFFERENCE!  There are absolutely breathtaking ""cliff shots"" where the camera sort of glides along a cliff (in a helicopter of course), but manages to focus on the water in the canyon below; simply the BEST I've ever see for this type of shot. I'm thinking in particular of a series of shots labeled ""Below Glen Canyon"" which are really remarkable.  And don't worry about camera shake; there ain't any! I guess the reason why they are selling this for such a cheap price is because they didn't use all the new-fangled high def stuff that sometimes gets in the way of truly excellent cinematography.  This is a keeper gang.  One for the ""had-a-crumby-day-at-the-office-need to-drift"" days when just a bit of relief is just what the digital doctor ordered.",1344384000,,1097,4.823529411764706
2653427,5,1607811324,"Received the DVD on time, sooner than advertised, brand new condition. If you are ordering one for own use, I would recommend getting it in Blue Ray format.  For my purpose however, I do not have a Blue Ray player at my school where we will be viewing it.

As far as the music, I guess it's OK if you are into classical which I am not, nor are my students, so I will just play other music while viewing.",1341532800,,403,4.025

Much of the HD is great quality, but some of the video is not as sharp as others.

The background music is classical -- a nice selection of mostly familiar pieces. I thought it was an appropriate and non-obtrusive selection. There's very little speaking. The landscape can speak for itself, and it does!

There were not a lot of reviews of this Blu-ray, but I found it excellent. I don't think you can go wrong with this! I strongly recommend this to experience something amazing with your ""big screen"" TV.

But I was so enthralled by the music, the unparalleled photography, the exhilarating river rafting, and the breathtaking canyon shots, I took it back to the library and bought my own copy.

Also fabulous on my home entertainment system to listen to, or to have playing in the background while I'm cleaning my house.
