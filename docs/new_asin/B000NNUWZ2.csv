8179564,4,B000NNUWZ2,"Hazumu confesses his love to Yasuna, but he is rejected. One day he is nearly killed by an alien space ship that crashes. The aliens are able to save his life, but somehow he is turned into a girl during the process. Now Hazumu has to adjust to being a girl. He was never a boyish dude, so it's not all that hard. Now Hazumu is caught in a love triangle with her old  tomboyish friend, Tomari, and Yasuna. Yasuna discovers that she has feelings for Hazumu, now that he's a she. That's pretty mean if you ask me. The whole get lost attitude changes now that Hazumu is a hot chick. But that's the way this series goes.

This anime has a very different type of atmosphere to it. It's a bit like Destiny of the Shrine Maiden, and it also reminds me of Kanokon. My only complaint is that the voice actors are bad. That's probably why it reminds me of Kanokon lol. The animation, soundtrack, and chracters are all very well done. It's fun, dramatic, funny, and emotional. The language isn't too overboard, and the fanservice is kinda conservative most of the time. So far, there isn't any nudity. It's rated 13 and up, so it's probably acceptable for most audiences...provided that they don't mind the whole Yuri theme, even though it's lighter than most of the stuff in that genre. I am enjoying this anime so far, and I hope it keeps getting better.",1356998400,,1345,4.419354838709677
8179565,1,B000NNUWZ2,"This review rating isn't a reflection of the show. This disc is supposed to be dubbed and it isn't , the menu doesn't even have any language or subtitle options , which is kind of weird since all the writing on the case is in english.  I had seen a few episodes online and wanted my own copy because I really enjoyed what I'd seen , it was an interesting premise that I wanted to see to conclusion. But since I'm not fluent in japanese , I guess I'm out of luck for now.",1289520000,,470,4.0
8179566,5,B000NNUWZ2,"This is one of the best anime I have seen in a long time. I have always loved Japanese romantic comedies but this one is really among the top. I love how it is heartwarming when it wants to be yet is absolutely hilarious at other times, the perfect blend of romance and comedy. This anime contains some content that makes it kinda yuri but since it's not part of Seven Seas' Strawberry line I guess it isn't considered so. I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 because there is a good amount of non sexual nudity and some dirty jokes, but anyone hoping for some hardcore yuri might want to look elsewhere. The only thing that could have possibly made it better is if it was longer. By the way this anime has no English track so if you don't want to read subtitles and don't understand Japanese don't get it, otherwise for the love of God get it.",1206230400,,857,4.2317073170731705
8179567,4,B000NNUWZ2,"This is the first manga-based anime I've seen, (like Robert, I'm a grandpa too) and I enjoyed it very much.  I wasn't sure where the story was heading when I first started, but I found the plot of Hazumu (the changling) having to deal with how to handle choosing between the two girls who love him/her, and the two girls dealing with both that issue and their relationship with each other, most intriguing.

Some potential viewers may be concerned about the gender-bender aspect of this story, and the lesbian flavor it creates.  It seemed to me that the nitty-gritty of this story could've proceeded just as easily if Hazumu had remained a boy, and had to choose between the girls. While Hazumu's body is rebuilt as a girl after the accident, his mind appears to still be that of a boy. He/she seems to develop more into the female frame of mind as the story progresses.

I may be second-guessing the author of this story, but it occurred to me that the change from boy to girl may have been utilized to allow the subject of feelings to be explored as they were. It's no mystery that males aren't champions of verbalizing emotional issues. Even though Hazumu was a sensitive and somewhat effeminate boy from the start, I think the physical change was used to let his character deal with feelings and emotions more expressively.

My only complaint with the series was the behavior of Hazumu's father. It didn't further the plot at all, and wasn't funny the first time, let alone as a running gag. Fortunately, Hazumu's mother decks him every time he gets out of line. Still, it could've been left out of the anime as well as the book, and wouldn't have been missed.

I'm looking forward to reading the manga, which I understand was completed after the anime was finished. The third volume of this DVD series contains a 13th follow-on episode, further resolving the state of affairs at the end of the original series. I'm anxious to see how the author ties things up at the end of the fifth volume of his book.",1202342400,,2009,4.582172701949861
8179568,3,B000NNUWZ2,"If you know the story or understand Japanese this is enjoyable.  Otherwise, since it is not translated, you're going to be at a loss.",1195948800,,133,4.541666666666667
8179569,4,B000NNUWZ2,Having read the first three volumes of the graphic novel (via Amazon as well) I was looking forward to the animated version.  I am pleased to say that the animated series is a delight to watch.  The story progresses smoothly and the comedic elements are well timed.  I am particularly fond of the moment that shows the exact point and time of impact between Hazumu and the space ship.,1194048000,,384,4.536231884057971
8179570,4,B000NNUWZ2,"An interesting take on the old love triangle. A boy in love with one girl while another is in love with him that is until the boy is accidentally turned into a girl after a close encounter with an alien space ship. Now that he is a she his/her romantic problems get even more confusing with both the girls in her life and the boy who was his now her best friend.
Note: this is subtitled only, there is no English dialogue and the subtitles themselves are a bit large and distracting but otherwise its an interesting story and nicely animated.",1186531200,3,542,4.376237623762377
8179571,4,B000NNUWZ2,"The basic plot for this shoojo anime is a love triangle involving three girls in high school.  One of the girls was originally a boy, but got changed into a girl during an unfortunate encounter with space aliens.

The principal focus of this anime (like most shoojo anime) is on feelings and relationships.  People who like mecha and demons should look elsewhere for entertainment.

Since I have two daughters and a granddaughter, I am rather fond of girls in general, and I particularly like the three main characters in this anime.  I wish them well in their struggles with their feelings, although I do wonder why they need to form a triangle; why can't they just be three together, instead of splitting into a bonded pair and somebody who gets left out?

This anime is very well done, so far as the main characters are concerned.  I took off one star for the bizarre treatment of adults.",1181865600,10,891,4.6369426751592355
