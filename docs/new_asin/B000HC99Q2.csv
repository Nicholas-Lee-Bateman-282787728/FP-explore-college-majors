8138326,4,B000HC99Q2,"Reviewing the Halls of Ivy only:  Ronald Coleman plays Ronald Coleman.  Classic Ronald Coleman with his wife imitating Gracie Fields.  I like whatever he does and this made for TV program is predictable for the society it shows.  Some of the dialog is canned and from that time  in  a higher learning setting.  Coleman shows compassion for an older professor.  It is from another  TV  era  like everything is peachy and the Good Samaritan is alive and well and the Donna Reed Show is middle class America.  Not like today when people are antagonistic, there are few morals observed, shoot 'em ups play all the time with the obligatory chase scenes, and you cannot trust your neighbors.  I chose this DVD for the Coleman part only.  Did not watch the other two selections.",1438473600,5,771,4.6992481203007515
