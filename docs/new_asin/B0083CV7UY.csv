8524436,5,B0083CV7UY,"Intriguing program of archival war footage shot (entirely in black and white) by newsreel cameramen under actual battle conditions. These cameramen were attached to divisions of British, American, French and Russian armed forces during the trek from Paris to the Rhine during World War II. Spectacular footage of ground and air battles.

The Allies helped to rebuild a lot of France's infrastructure which the Germans had destroyed: Buildings, bridges, roads. However, the German still held the entrance to Bordeaux, but the Allied Forces were on the move.

The British developed 'Operation Pluto' - Operation Pluto (Pipe-Lines Under The Ocean) was a Second World War operation by British scientists, oil companies and armed forces to construct undersea oil pipelines under the English Channel between England and France. The scheme was developed by Arthur Hartley, chief engineer with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Allied forces on the European continent required a tremendous amount of fuel. Pipelines were considered necessary to relieve dependence on oil tankers, which could be slowed by bad weather, were susceptible to German submarines, and were also needed in the Pacific War. One million gallons of oil a day were shipped by these underground pipelines from England to France. It was an ingenious idea!

The Russian Army (The Red Army) marched in six groups to liberate France and Belgium, while the Germans were using armed railway trains to kill Italian resistance forces. The Russian Army surrounded the Germans in Poland, and literally obliterated them.

The Siege of Bastogne was an engagement in December 1944 between American and German forces at the Belgian town of Bastogne, as part of the larger Battle of the Bulge. The goal of the German offensive was the harbor at Antwerp. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the Ardennes mountain range converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. The siege lasted from December 20-27 when the besieged American forces were relieved by elements of General George Patton's Third Army. With a general like Patton in charge, as they say, the rest is history......

The British developed 'Fido'. Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation), which was sometimes referred to as ""Fog Intense Dispersal Operation"". It was a system used for dispersing fog from an airfield so that aircraft could land safely. The device was developed by Arthur Hartley for British RAF bomber stations, allowing the landing of aircraft returning from raids over Germany in poor visibility by burning fuel in rows on either side of the runway. The system worked with great results!

This program is thoroughly informative. You feel as if you are right there in the middle of all the action. I highly recommend this program to any World War II enthusiast. It is well worth the watch!",1379289600,2,3035,5.171079429735234
