879735,5,6304400225,"Actually, unknown might be a better word to use.  This movie is rollicking  fun from beginning to end, and features some wonderful animated moments.  This is the original home of the featurettes ""Mickey and the  Beanstalk"" and ""Bongo"", which are presented in their  entirety.  If you're looking for something a little different... an  alternative to the animated Broadway musical... this is it.  Highly  recommended.",968630400,39,416,5.375

879737,4,6304400225,"Fun and Fancy Free is a pairing of two short animations, a forgettable one about a circus bear called Bongo and the much better 'Mickey and the Beanstalk'.  Now, having said that Bongo is forgettable I should say that  he has proved a great hit with my two young (3 and 4 year old) daughters.  Whilst Bongo is something of a throwback to pre-war animation style,  'Mickey and the Beanstalk' is bang up to date (for the time) despite being  very much a folk tale.  The scene where Mickey and co are so poor they  ration out their bread by cutting it into slices so thin they're  transparent particularly engauged the attention of my older kid, who  immediately wanted me to do it!
Both animations have evidentally been  cleaned up and are pretty much flawless, both visually and aurally.  There  is none of the scratchiness associated with originals of this era.  Colours  are both vibrant and consistent and the sound quality particularly good and  full of body.
Disney animation releases on DVD have been improving  (painfully slowly) and this one includes a (very) few welcome extras.  The  most important extra (for me) is the documentary on the making of F&FF.  The kids though prefer the read-along stories that are also included.  The  Disney archives are massive (I've seen them), one day perhaps they'll see  fit to include more related material (stills, deleted scenes, background  character info., etc.) on the DVDs.  There's certainly plenty of room and  since so many of Disneys customers (aka cast) are aficionados, it would do  sales no harm at all.
There are still a couple of features I'm not keen  on though.  Why do Disney releases start with an FBI warning?  None of my  other DVDs do.  Also, why has the ability to skip past the adverts at the  beginning been disabled and the adverts not just been placed as a menu  option?  People will look at them there occasionally but don't need them in  their face every time.  The DVD has been bought and paid for, so it's not  like the adverts are subsidising the price or anything.
Still, over all  this is a resonably good package and well worth buying for either Disney  fans or young children.",964483200,9,2159,4.686327077747989

880108,4,6304400225,"As a Disney fan, I love that these early films are, at long last, getting an HD treatment.

This review is for the stand-alone HD version of FUN AND FANCY FREE, which I streamed as a rental.  I do intent to pick up the combo Blu-ray that is packaged with he Ichabod and Mr. Toad shorts in the not too distant future.  While the animation looks gorgeous, younger viewers might be put off by some of the live action sequences featuring Edgar Burgen.  It was a different time with a different sensibility towards humour.  For myself I appreciate the nostalgia of 'old Disney' that live action segments like this and in other package films (e.g. THE RELUCTANT DRAGON, etc.) convey.

For the quality of the stream, I found it to be crisp and pleasant to look with vibrant colours that certainly outdo older DVD presentations of these shorts.

On thing that prevents me from outright purchase of the digital/streaming versions like this is the lack of inclusion of any special features.  This is something that Amazon has started to change, though.  For the recent digital Diamond edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS there is a purchase option that includes all of the special features (it makes the running time close to 5 hours).  I have noted that ZOOTOPIA has a similar option now.  Hopefully this will filter out to many more of the disney titles as well.",1466726400,,1361,4.652719665271967
880109,1,6304400225,Not worthy of Disney! The Bongo sequence is offensive. It celebrates male bears slapping female bears to show love! This violence should be disclosed in the item description. This is not Classic Disney. It is classic chauvinism and stupidity.,1465171200,,242,5.230769230769231
880110,4,6304400225,"Two animated short subjects slapped together for the sake of making money after World War II.  Package films like this helped Disney earn enough money to begin making feature length animated films again.  For awhile, these were his bread and butter productions.  And it also helped boost Mickeys sagging popularity during the 40s.  At this point, Donald, Goofy, and Pluto were more popular.

Bongo is the first short film, the tale of a circus bear who yearns to be free.  He escapes confinement on a circus train and must learn to fend for himself in the wilderness.  This movie is narrated by Dinah Shore.  There are several songs too many, all of them instantly forgettable.

Mickey and the Beanstalk is narrated by Edgar Bergen, a ventriloquist who worked better on radio where you couldn't t see his lips move.  The story more or less follows the original fairytale, albeit in an abbreviated form.  Donald dominates this movie.  Willie the Giant is hilarious.",1464739200,4,964,4.882716049382716

880194,5,6304400225,"Walt Disney made a few films like this one, where it's a feature length film with a series of short stories.  He did this so he could raise money to make his bigger films like Cinderella or Peter Pan.  That doesn't mean that Fun and Fancy Free isn't a good movie in it's own right.  In fact, it's an outstanding little movie that everyone should enjoy watching.

The First short in the movie is the story of Bongo, a circus bear.  Unless you are steeped in Disney knowledge, chances are you've never heard of this little bear, but it's very well animated and narrated.

The second short is Mickey and the Beanstalk.  This has all the stars like Mickey, Goofy, and Donald.  The story is told by Edgar Bergen, something Disney would do again later with Roy Rogers introducing Pecos Bill in Melody Time.

Another interesting note about this short is that Walt Disney himself was the voice of Mickey Mouse.  He had been the voice many times before, but this would be the last time he would be the voice of the Mouse.  That alone makes it noteworthy.

Overall it's a Disney Gold!  watch it and relax!",1454371200,5,1095,4.46969696969697

880479,3,6304400225,"While none of the package features that the Disney Studios released during the aftermath of World War II have stayed very popular intact, elements from them are actually quite popular.  In fact, it might be a surprise to learn that a few of their popular mid-length releases started out in these features.  Thats certainly the case with one of the two segments from Fun and Fancy Free.

Jiminy Cricket is our host for this movie, and he opens it with the title song (a song that was written for him and then cut from Pinocchio.)  After that song is over, he transitions into the two stories, but his overall part in the film is very small.

Up first is Bongo, the story of a circus bear who is trained to do all kinds of acts.  Hes the star of the show, but when not in the big top, hes a prisoner of the owners.  All that changes when he discovers his cage is unlocked one day and makes a daring escape into the wild.  But will the bear be able to survive on his own?  And what will happen when he meets up with other bears?

This portion is told by Dinah Shore, who sings a few songs that go along with the film.  Theres no spoken dialogue between characters.  Animals in a Disney film not talking  shocking isn't it?  Still, the story is fairly entertaining and contains some great physical comedy as only a cartoon can do.  As it turns into a romance, the comedy keeps coming, and that part of the story is just as entertaining.

Id guess that most kids would actually enjoy this short with the exception of the music.  While popular for the 1940s, the style is definitely dated today.  If kids are young enough, they probably won't care.  Still, its probably not something they would be clamoring to watch over and over again.

The second feature is Mickey and the Beanstalk, and this is the one that I was surprised to learn had originated in a longer film the first time I watched this movie.  Its Disney take on the classic tale with Mickey, Donald, and Goofy in the roll of Jack and a giant who possesses some magic.  DisNerds will be interested to note that this was the last time Walt regularly provided the voice of Mickey.

Yes, the characters actually talk here, and the voice casting is perfect.  In addition to our three heroes and the Giant, theres also a singing harp.  That means we get several new songs, but they seem to fit typical Disney movies of the era, and I would guess that kids will actually enjoy them.  I know I did when I was a kid.

This story is told by Edgar Bergen, a ventriloquist of the day, and it cuts away occasionally to him, his puppets, and a little girl who is celebrating her birthday.  This is the only live action in the film.  Parts of it are certainly fun, but I feel it slows down the story overall.  Or maybe its just the fact that I grew up watching Mickey and the Beanstalk without those live action interruptions.  Either way, I feel this part is dated and might turn off kids.  I wish for DVD releases they had included just the animated portions as an extra.

While both of these stories have the ability to entertain kids, I think the dated elements will keep them from requesting Fun and Fancy Free on a regular basis.  However, die hard Disney fans will still enjoy having it in their collection as a stepping stone from World War II into the animated films of the 1950s.",1434758400,,3332,4.35551948051948

Bongo is boring, but whatever, that's not the movie we wanted anyways.

So just fast forward thru that part, right?! WRONG!  Creeper and his dummies chatter thru the ENTIRE Mickey and the beanstalk, even taking cutaways back to the locked room where he's holding the little girl captive...with his entertaining ventriloquist act.

880987,2,6304400225,"So I rented this recently through amazon instant video. It was one of the few Disney movies I hadn't seen yet. I didn't really have expectations for it. Unfortunately I feel let down.
Now if you don't know, Fun and Fancy Free is basically a collection of cartoons and not a full feature like Dumbo or Snow White. It's 2 short films, Bongo the Runaway Circus Bear and Mickey and the Beanstalk loosely tied together with Jiminy Cricket and a ventriloquist telling the stories. My problem is these shorts are to long for their own good. Bongo the Runaway Circus Bear is around 45 minutes long. That would be fine if the story wasn't boring. With the kind of story that they tell, I feel they could easily tell it in 20-25 minutes. It just feels like it drags on and on. And it's not like it just wasn't my kind of entertainment, there was a fair amount of redundancy in the songs story elements. Not to mention the story is just kind of boring. Bongo is a circus bear, a famous circus bear, that runs away from the circus because he wants freedom. Once in the wild, he doesn't really know how to live in the wild, and he overcomes it. Then he falls in love, and he has to defeat the other suitor. It's really basic, doesn't really do anything special, and just drags on and on for 45 minutes.
Now Mickey and the Beanstalk is rather good. I'm quite familiar with the normal Jack and the Beanstalk story. This one follows the story, but unlike the normal story where the giant is a victim of circumstance as I see it now as an adult, the giant is like a legitimate bad guy that took the prosperity of the land by taking the harp that gives the land it's beauty, and Micky and the gang aim to return prosperity to the land even if it is for personal gain. That is a really interesting take on the classic story. While it is a little longer than I think it needs to be, it's about the right length. The added length is really the fault of the ventriloquist because this is his section and he interrupts the story at times. Really throws off the flow.
So what about Jiminy Cricket and the ventriloquist? Their only purpose is to link these 2 completely unrelated short films so it could be marketed as a feature. They don't really add anything. They're rather unnecessary. Like mentioned earlier, the ventriloquist actually takes a good short and lowers the quality of the short he's telling.
Now don't get me wrong, I love Disney features and theatrical shorts. On a technical side, this movie delivers most of the Disney magic in terms of animation and scoring. That and the overall quality of Micky and the Beanstalk are what keeps me from giving this a 1 star review. If Bongo was shorter, if the ventriloquist was completely absent, and if there was more connection between the shorts, then this would be great; 4 star, maybe even 5. If time was an issue, add another short. But as it stands, really not impressed. Mickey and the Beanstalk is the only good part, and would be better without the ventriloquist interrupting. According to other reviewers, Mickey and the Beanstalk was a single short. If you want to see it, try to find some original cut of it somewhere else.",1394236800,,3169,4.4561101549053355

The studio's 9th effort Fun and Fancy Free is a charming group of short subjects worthy of a place in any Disney fan's library. While certainly not on par with any of their previous efforts this is still Disney when Walt was still alive.

It's a shame that the studio seems to disregard these selections from this time period because I think restored versions for the 6 films during this period could be put into one Blu Ray box set  and maybe entice Disney fans to purchase these forgotten little gems. This film doesn't have any edits Hooray! ..at least none I'm aware of?

If the studio wants these films to sell well, they have to show a little effort!. I own the Gold Edition of this release and it will have to do until a decent upgrade comes along.

I hope Disney is listening and does a decent job restoring this(, Saludos Amigos(unedited), The Three Caballeros (unedited), Make Mine Music(unedited), Melody Time and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. Then releases them on Blu Ray in a single box set and adds as much bonus material as they can find. Then maybe they'll see that even the little guys can make them a profit again.

Bongo is about a bear that was born in the circus, grew up in the circus and performed in the circus, but wanted a life outside of the circus. Bongo wanted to be a regular bear. The story is told and sung by Dinah Shore. If you know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk then Mickey and the Beanstalk sort of follows the same pattern. The major differences are it is narrated by Edgar Bergen and has Goofy and Donald Duck and the three of the rescue the Golden Harp that was stolen by Willie the Giant.

Both of these movies were to be full length features but due to World War II when a third of his staff was drafted into the arm services and the war department literally took over Disney Studios to make propaganda films and the lost of the European market force the two movies into one package film. The voice of Willie the Giant is played by Billy Gilbert who also voiced Sneezy from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Fun and Fancy Free would be the last movie that Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse. Fun and Fancy Free is enjoyable and gets an AAA+++.

881417,5,6304400225,"After Walt Disney's 1940 masterpiece FANTASIA failed at the box office, it's surprising he ever again tried illustrating music with animation-- yet he did, gratefully.

Some of Disney's best and these days generally unknown 1940s animated features follow the format laid down in FANTASIA. Created in part from scraps left over when the majority of Walt's animators were involved in WWII, these musical montages are quite good.

The second of these creations, FUN AND FANCY FREE (1947) consists of remnants of what had originally bern planned as two separate feature films. Artists who contributed voiceovers here include:

Edgar Bergen - Himself, Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd
Luana Patten - Herself
Cliff Edwards - Jiminy Cricket
Walt Disney/Jimmy MacDonald- Mickey Mouse
Clarence Nash - Donald Duck
Pinto Colvig - Goofy
Billy Gilbert - The Giant
Anita Gordon - Singing Harp
Dinah Shore - Singer/Narrator of Bongo

Based on a Sinclair Lewis short story, BONGO is about a bear cub that escapes from a circus for some adventures in the wild. While exploring a house, Jiminy Cricket plays a record that tells the story. The narrator is Dinah Shore.

MICKEY AND THE BEANSTALK has in it three of Disney's most popular cartoon characters. Happy Valley is experoencing a terrible drought. All that Mickey, Donald and Goofy have left to eat is a single loaf of bread, which they divide ever so carefully. Mickey trades their cow for a handful of magic beans after Donald nearly kills the creature for food. Donald angrily tosses the beans away and overnight they grow into a giant beanstalk. As in the original fairy tale, our heroes ascend the plant and encounter a giant (named Wille) and a singing golden harp he has stolen.

881418,1,6304400225,"Unlike most others who have written reviews, I purchased this DVD specifically for the story of Bongo. I watched the VHS version of this Walt Disney Mini Classic endlessly as a kid. When I found this DVD, I was absolutely elated... until I put it in to watch it.

The story, which was narrated by Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) in the VHS release in 1989, was narrated on the DVD by Dinah Shore. Probably due to my own nostalgia and disappointment of not hearing Jiminy throughout the feature, her voice lacked any kind of appeal whatsoever. She also sang over all of the popular songs presented in the movie. At the time, it felt like Disney robbed me at gunpoint. I will admit, I was unaware that there was more than one version of Bongo out there. However, I wish that somewhere in the item description there would be a note telling buyers which version of the film they are buying.

Be warned... don't feel premature excitement at reclaiming a lost piece of your childhood if what you are looking for is the soothing voice of Jiminy Cricket. This DVD does not present that version of Bongo, or the original version of Mickey and the Beanstalk. Your time and money are better spent finding a working VHS player.",1327536000,5,1214,4.564220183486238

Ok anyway -- whenever the live action sequences came on (which is pretty often) my kid would cry MICKEY!  MORE MICKEY!  We had to do a lot of fast-forwarding.  Definitely not worth the 1.99 download.",1327276800,,499,4.625
881420,5,6304400225,"Peter Pan is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released in theaters on February 5, 1953. Peter Pan tells the story of a young boy who refuses to grow up, but at times act likes an adult. The story begins at the home of George and Mary Darling whose three children (Wendy, John, and Michael). After sending the children to bed, George and Mary Darling leave their home to attend a formal party. Peter Pan arrives at the children's nursery to find his shadow. When he does, Wendy offers to sew it on for him. Peter Pan offers to take the children to Never Land and teaches them how to fly as well with faith, hope and some pixie dust from Tinker Bell. By the way to get to Never Land takes the second star to the right and straight on till morning. As soon as they reach Never Land they are fired at by Captain Hook. Captain Hook wants revenge at Peter for cutting off his left hand and feeding it to the crocodile. Peter Pan saves the children. Later in the day Peter Pan rescues Tiger Lily from Captain Hook who wanted her to reveal the location of Peter Pan. Captain Hook eventually does find Peter Pan's hideout and plants a bomb to destroy him. Tinker Bell comes to the rescue and saves Peter Pan. Peter Pan flies over to Captain Hook ship and the two of them have their final fight. In the end Peter Pan takes the children back home.

I know I left a lot of the story out but I wanted to add some other information to my review. First this is the first Peter Pan that a male actor played the lead; in previous plays and movies Peter Pan was played by a female. It was Margaret Kerry and not Marilyn Monroe who was the model for Tinker Bell. In keeping with the stage version tradition, Hans Conried voice both George Darling and Captain Hook. Peter Pan was the last movie the Disney's famed ""Nine Old Men"" worked on together. Also this was the last movie to be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. In this film version Tinker Bell actually has a body; in the stage version she was represented by a beam of light. Finally this was Disney's 14th animated feature. Peter Pan is an excellent movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.

881421,2,6304400225,"Although the granddaughter wants to watch Mickey- she looses interest before Mickey even makes an appearance.  And while there are good messages about worrying less- it is concerning to watch the bears smack each other around -all in the name of love.  Domestic violence is difficult enough for children to endure without the confusing message that it really is a show of love.  If you are looking for a Mickey Mouse tape for your child or grandchild, I would pick something else.",1324080000,,480,4.829268292682927
881422,5,6304400225,"By way of a story on record sung by Dinah Shore, and a tale told by Edgar Bergen and pals to entertain a young birthday guest, ""Fun and Fancy Free"" relays to us the stories of ""Bongo"", a circus bear who escapes to the woods and discovers true love, and ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"", the famous fairytale retold to star Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and the hilarious Willy the Giant. Oh, and that gorgeous singing harp!

More than just the famous tale of ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"", ""Fun and Fancy Free"" is a musical birthday party hosted by an animated Jiminy Cricket and a live-action Edgar Bergen, complete with Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, and of course the guest of honor, the adorable Miss Luana Patten, whom I certainly had a crush on as a kid (especially in Johnny Tremain). Jiminy shows his talents here as being much more than Pinocchio's sidekick and conscience, and the live-action bits prove to be as delightful as the two animated stories showcased within. If you grew up with Mickey and the Beanstalk, this may or may not be the version you know. Outside of this feature film, the story is usually hosted by Professor Ludwig Von Drake (one of Donald's uncles) or narrated by the voice of Sterling Holloway. Here, it is Edgar Bergen all the way. The whole film is a treat with top notch Disney animation and storytelling, plenty of humor, plenty of charming music, and plenty of lighthearted fun. It is definitely aptly named. You CAN find the Ludwig Von Drake version of Mickey and the Beanstalk on the Disney Animation Collection, vol. 1, so I hear (still need to pick that up, I do enjoy me some Ludwig), but this is the true source. Highly recommended, and a must for the library of any true Disney fan.

The DVD, by the way, is a fine presentation, particularly because it includes an actual making-of featurette! You wouldn't expect to find such attention paid to classic Disney ""package"" films like this one. And a fine featurette it is, too. In addition, we have that now legendary Lou Bega ""Disney's Mambo No. 5"" music video, as well as a fun trivia game and a DVD storybook. My only complaints here are that there are several Disney animated shorts that could appropriately accompany this film, not to mention the alternate versions of Mickey and the Beanstalk, and also that the trivia game provides no video prize at all, unlike past Disney DVD trivia games. This is where a short would have been very nice. Oh well. Hard to complain when we get that featurette. Still a must-have DVD, no doubt!",1320451200,,2531,4.647321428571429

I had seen the version with Ludwig Von Drake and didn't even know this version existed until I read about it.  This one is much more magical.  I also love Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd and Luana Patten in this.  It reminds me of the way 'Pecos Bill' is done (another favorite Disney short).

Oh, and there are a couple of cartoons in this video, too. But fortunately there is ""Chapter Selection"" so you can go directly to Chapter 12 and enjoy seeing Bergen do his ventriloquism. ""Bongo"" would be enjoyable if you're, say three, but as a grownup I found it to be way too long and way too sugary sweet. The Disneyfied version of Jack & and Beanstalk was enjoyable, but I wish they had much more footage of Edgar Bergen, Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd.

While it is true that the Bergen interruptions are each longer than the Von Drake interruptions, it nothing a child with a decent attention span and sense of comedy cannot handle.  Quite frankly, I don't understand what is so ""unsettling"" about McCarthy and Snerd (i.e., the two dummies).  These characters are classics.

It is a short, but fascinating look at the Disney Studios in 1947 and contains some brief, but previously unseen footage of Walt, himself, from that time.  I would agree with the reviewers who say that the weakest part of the film is the Bongo segment.  However, some of your writers need to do their homework before making the statement that the version of Mickey and the Beanstalk presented is an edited version with Edgar Bergen added as narrators.  Indeed, this is the original version!  It was the various incarnations on Disney's Wonderful World of Color that were re-edited, some with Professor Ludwick von Drake replacing the original Bergen/McCarthy narration.

Instead there is this version with ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummies reading the story to a little girl.  I wouldn't have minded if it was just an introduction, but Edgar Bergin and the dummies keep making comments throughout the entire cartoon.
This was a complaint I always had with the Walt Disney show when it was on.  They would take classic cartoons that originally played in theaters re-edit them and show them on TV.  Sometimes they would take bits from several different cartoons and combine them to make a show that had a certain theme.  I hated that.

As a professional ventriloquist myself, I am slightly biased as I am a big Bergen fan. Even still, Mickey and the beanstalk was one of the funniest cartoon Disney ever did.

Bongo was cute but maybe too cute for my taste. I liked Dinah Shores narration. Don't forget she was a big star when this movie came out.

881568,4,6304400225,"I have mixed feelings about this supposedly full-length feature.  The full-length feature is actually the story of circus bear Bongo and a separate story, ""Mickey and the Beanstalk,"" loosely tied together.  Dinah Shore narrates the story of Bongo and provides some musical accompaniment.  Edgar Bergen, Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd and Luana Patten periodically interrupt the story of ""Mickey and the Beanstalk.""

""Bongo"" is the story of a small circus bear that longs for the wild, until he suddenly finds himself in the wild with wild bears.  Soon Bongo falls in love with a cute little bear, but discovers that another, larger bear also has designs on the cute girl bear.  Mayhem ensues and we wonder whether Bongo will persevere.

""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" is a clever retelling of ""Jack and the Beanstalk.""  This clever film was the last time Walt Disney voiced Mickey.  The antics of Goofy, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are humorous and creative, and held my attention from beginning to end.

There are several problems with ""Fun and Fancy Free.""  The primary problem is that neither feature is long enough to be a feature.  Disney increased the length of both features by wrapping filler between them and adding Edgar Bergen and his marionettes telling the story of ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" to pretty Luana Patten.  Unfortunately, the additional material only adds a little to the basic stories, and frequently distracts from the stories.

Another problem with this film is that the story of Bongo is weak, particularly in comparison with the much more powerful story of ""Mickey and the Beanstalk.""  ""Bongo"" has a few moments where the animation is cute and clever, but when I watched this cartoon I thought the entire thing should have been fifteen minutes long.

I am glad I have this film and I am happy to have watched it, though my joy relates mostly to ""Mickey and the Beanstalk.""  ""Bongo"" is a cartoon that I will likely not watch for some time.  I also wish that ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" was without the interruptions of Edgar Bergen.

""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" is a Disney classic and by itself it would have been a five star feature.  Releasing this film in the format it was released in theaters may be appropriate in the context of releasing a ""full-length"" feature, but the stuff beyond ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" reduces the five-star rating.  Considering the excellence of ""Mickey and the Beanstalk,"" I am keeping the rating for this DVD at 4 stars.

to facilitate listening by my class.  I recall how eerie the call

of the wild, ""BONGO!"" sounded, causing a chill to run down my spine;  in the record, Cliff Edwards (as Jiminy Cricket) remarked that as the circus train moved into the night, with the circus traveling between cities, it seemed to be speaking to Bongo, but that it wasn't the circus train but the call of the wild.  Yes, the video, Fun and Fancy Free, DID follow very closely the record that I heard.  So did the Golden Book Bongo, and the story in Walt Disney's Treasury.  So, when I obtained the video, what I heard and read about that wonder bear Bongo who was king of the circus DURING his act but then humiliatingly caged and escaped and became a WOODS bear, all came back to me.

881658,3,6304400225,"In this, the ninth feature animation film of Disney's Canon classics, we are treated again to two featurettes - ""Bongo"" and ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"".

""Bongo"", with narration by Dinah Shore (a rather unusual choice for this story) is the story of a circus bear who dreams of life in the wild.  But when he finally gets his wish, he finds he is unprepared for that life.  The story of how he adapts to his new situation is priceless.  This is a story that, even though made in 1947, has relevance today.

The version of ""Bongo"" that I remember best is the one from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"", which, if I can remember that far back, did not have Dinah Shore doing the narrating chores, and was a much better cartoon for it.

The other featurette, ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"", marks the final time that Walt Disney himself will create the voice of Mickey Mouse.  The story of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" retold in a Disney format, it stars Mickey, Donald, Goofy, the Magic Harp (with a wonderful singing voice!), and a wily magical giant named Willy.  This is absolutely worth the price of admission.  The DVD makes this Disney version of a timeless story watchable over and over again.

""Beanstalk"" is also narrated, this time by Edgar Bergan and his cast of marionettes.  This exact reproduction of the theatrical release is fun, but not as much fun as it would have been had it included the narrator I remember from showings of the featurette on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"".

7871584,4,6304400225,"As a lifelong Disney fan, I have seen a lot of Disney films during my childhood ---- whether they were animated or live-action, they've made a huge difference in my life, showing how to live a good life and make a big difference in the world. ""Fun And Fancy Free"" is one of my favorites because it's one of several Disney classics that I watched a lot during my childhood; simply because it's the only package film that was made that has Mickey Mouse (who is my number one favorite Disney character) in it.

It was on this day, 70 years ago in 1947, that this film was theatrically released on the big-screen. The film consists of a couple of stories: ""Bongo"" and ""Mickey And The Beanstalk"", with some live-action segments in-between the both of them.

The film is one of a bunch of what is called ""package films"" that Walt Disney and his team made during the 1940s due to the outbreak of the Second World War and the Army taking control on Walt's company. After the war ended, Walt Disney and his team had lost a lot of money, so they chose to make some more package films so as to rebuild their status and reputation. Additionally, they would also bring in well-known celebrities from those early decades (the 1930s and the 1940s) to host the segments in their package films. For ""Fun And Fancy Free"", they brought in singer Dinah Shore to narrate the story of ""Bongo"" and ventriloquist Edger Bergen and child actress Luana Patten to narrate the story of ""Mickey And The Beanstalk"". Even Jiminy Cricket, the popular supporting character from ""Pinocchio"" (1940) is featured in this film.

Nowadays,  I find it to be one of Disney's most underrated movies. The reason why is because it's not really talked about very much nowadays, possibly because those who watch it for the first time feel like nothing much stands out since it's not really a full-length story. One example could be the live-action segments that take place in the second half of the movie, which consists of ventriloquist Edger Bergen hosting child actress Luana Patten (one of those child actresses from the 1930s and the 1940s who featured in some of Walt Disney's future live-action movies in the 1950s)'s birthday party. As a kid, I was never bothered by the live-action segments. I honestly find it to be a rather smooth transition to the next segment, thus helping me feel that they both belonged in the same movie, but I can see now that they do feel a bit out of place for today's moviegoers. Seeing how today's society is, its likely that some people will find something kind of odd about this little arrangement, but, for me, I believe that it's possible that he's a friend of her family and he's probably watching her while her parents are away.

What makes ""Fun And Fancy Free"" one of my favorite Disney movies as well as a personal favorite of mine is that this film marked the very last time that Walt Disney himself would regularly provide the voice of Mickey Mouse, since Walt had become far too busy with other projects and, because he was a heavy smoker, his vocal chords had become weakened, so he had James *Jimmy* MacDonald take over providing the voice of Mickey Mouse.

While it may not be one of Disney's greatest, ambitious, or artfully impressive works, ""Fun And Fancy Free"" is a well-made package film that has it's moments and it's a wonderful opportunity to see Mickey Mouse and his friends together. While it may not be a full-length story, we can still enjoy it for what it is and what it has to offer; especially since it's the only package film featuring the world's one and only beloved little mouse who started the path for Disney to become one of the world's greatest movie empires of all-time.",1506556800,2,3699,4.613981762917933
