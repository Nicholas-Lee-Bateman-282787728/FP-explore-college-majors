Seeing Metzger's New York is seeing an homage to a city that no longer exists.  Seeing these films themselves is an homage, and an honour and a privilege, to a genre that no longer exists.  Not only does ""Hollywood,"" or ""New York,"" or just about anywhere else on the planet no longer make films that are worth watching, but in a scant thirty years, the Adult Entertainment Industry has succumbed to the demise of not only its ""Golden Age"" but any respectable age.  I cannot begin to surpass the quality of commentary that exists around Metzger's films.

We are fortunate to have Eric Edwards, Georgia Spelvin and a few others still with us for the historic interviews which are contained on these discs.  They were young thirty to 40 years ago and therefore are relatively young now and can provide context to the whole enterprise.

Distribpix Inc. has also outdone and surpassed itself and anyone else in the packaging of these films.  It is all there: brochures, pamphlets, mini-books, interviews, outtakes, some manner of ""behind the scenes,"" and beautiful travelogues of locations around New York City.",1415404800,2,1245,4.947115384615385
8516334,5,B007GGI88M,"ALL THREE FILMS LOOK LIKE THEY WERE JUST MADE. I LOVE THE FACT THAT IS WAS MADE ON FILM. THE LOOK IS LIKE A FIRST RUN MOVIE, NOT A STRATE TO VIDEO AS MOST ARE DONE. THE MOVIES KEEP YOUR INTREST NOT OVER RUN WITH BORING HUMPING LIKE THE GUYS TAKE FOREVER TO FINISH. THE WOMEN HAVE HAIR AND THATS REFRESHING.",1357689600,4,306,4.032786885245901
