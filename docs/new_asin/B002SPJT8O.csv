8379455,3,B002SPJT8O,Excellent history for those of us who enjoy such history.  I would give this 5 stars except that it is waaay too pricey for the number of minutes of video included.  My desire was to eventually get the entire set; but I can't see my way clear to doing that with the price being way above what one normally pays for a single DVD.,1452729600,,328,4.109375
