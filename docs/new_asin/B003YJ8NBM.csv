4229440,5,B003YJ8NBM,"Since I tried my hand at reviewing Race Across the Sky 2010 I think I should go back for a moment and review the movie that got me going on this mountain bike racing kick in the first place: Ride the Divide.

My wife texted me to tell me about a movie her father had called in giddy pallor to tell her about, indicating that we would really like it. He had watched it on the Documentary Channel and couldn't stop thinking about it.

I got online and found that they had two copies at the public library, so I stopped on my way home and checked it out.

It took us a couple of nights to find the time to sit through it but we were both amazed and thought it was a fine specimen of a cycling film. The soundtrack is stunning and works seamlessly with the rest of the film.

The human story revealed is not as heart wrenching as that displayed in RATS 2010, but you get caught up in the trials of the racers. And toward the end as Matthew Lee races for the border you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat. You know he's going to make it, but you begin straining forward, reaching into the future to grasp the finish with both hands.

The first thing I said about the film to my wife was, ""I want to do the Tour Divide!""

She suggested in a couple of years that we should both do it. I was struck dumb. My wife is not an avid mountain biker. In fact, she gave her mountain bike away a few months ago.

The music played constantly in my head from that day forward and I kept seeing the striking scenes of mountain bikes racing past the camera along dirt roads and trails with the awe-inspiring scenery of the Rocky Mountains splashed behind as the background. I started jonesing for a mountain bike.

When my in-laws came in to visits just a week later we watched the movie a couple more times with my father-in-law and it was obvious he was chomping at the bit to get out and do some biking while on vacation in Colorado. He had carried his bike 1200 miles on the off chance we could ride.

The movie is inspiring. It makes me want to ride my bike a lot more. It has made my morning commutes more enjoyable, it has given me something to aspire to in the long run.

I'd give it five stars just for that alone.",1294876800,26,2214,4.1160092807424595
4229441,5,B003YJ8NBM,"Ride the divide, is a story of the quest a group of cyclists take along the continental divide. It is an extreme journey with every obstacle you can find. all while riding on their trusty mountain bikes. Fighting the elements, stress, strain, and mental fatigue. It is a story of struggle and achievement. with heartfelt emotion these riders it makes all recreational riders respect the strength required for this feat, and hope to train harder to participate in the future.

After watching this movie, i got my bike all loaded up so i could train to participate in this ride as soon as possible. A real motivating movie.",1294876800,,621,4.75
4229442,4,B003YJ8NBM,This is a fun documentary of one of the most challenging physical events in the world. Definitely interesting to watch,1294876800,,118,4.95
4229443,2,B003YJ8NBM,"I agree with J. McCracken. I was expecting it to showcase the awesome scenery and challenging terrain of the TD route along with some amazing mountain biking footage. In fact I paid the extra cost to get it on Blu-ray so I would get the full effect of the scenery. However, like stated in the other post, it's about 20% of the film. The rest is whining by people not quite up to the task.

Also not up to the task are the filmmakers themselves. Filming this race would be a monumental task. I understand the difficulty in logistics getting shots along a rout with hard to find riders. However, the riders all wear SPOT GPS locators and there are maps of the rout so it's no real secret where they or the rout are. These guys could not even be present for the group start. Not to mention that with today's tech there could have been a few helmet cams on a rider or two. in short the majority of filming it's self is what you would expect from a couple of guys with a video camera and a MAC. I did enjoy the sound track though.

The sequence and interviews with Matthew Lee are great and clearly show that he not only has a great deal of knowledge about the ride but truly cares for it as well.

If you are looking low budget reality TV buy the DVD. If you are looking for detailed scenery and Mountain biking footage from the Tour Divide, it just is not there. Don't spend extra on the Blu-ray.",1293062400,13,1393,4.209737827715355
4229444,2,B003YJ8NBM,"I was sure I'd love this film and watch it repeatedly. I was expecting it to showcase the awesome scenery and challenging terrain of the Great Divide route along with some fantastic mountain biking footage. It did deliver some of that, maybe 20% of the content.  There was a stunning shot of the Tetons rising above Jackson Lake.  A clever interview with a ""typical Montanan"" out cuttin fire wood.  An excellent sequence covering Matthew Lee as he bivies up for the night and then makes it to town the next morning for a real breakfast.  Lee also contributes the best interview material as someone who is a repeat rider on the Great Divide, obviously appreciates and respects the route and has something worthwhile to say.  Finally, there is a very short bonus feature on mountain bike gear for racing the Great Divide.

Unfortunately the bulk of the film (80%) plays out like bad reality TV. Too much whining: about hills, and snow, and bears, in the middle of nowhere, without email, and no one to talk to, I wanna go home!  Too many scenes wasted on people talking on cell phones.  Why?

I think this is a story that is still waiting to be filmed.  Right now, Jill Homer's blog offers the best panorama of the Great Divide.",1292976000,48,1226,4.58256880733945
4229445,5,B003YJ8NBM,"I've been following Hunter Weeks since his debut with ""10 mph"", and absolutely *love* his work. This movie is no exception. You don't have to be a huge cycling enthusiast to enjoy this documentary. It is an amazing story of the power of the human spirit. The characters and their emotions are real, not portrayed by actors. I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this film this summer, and had so much fun reacting to it with the audience, just like a good movie can do for you. I already bought the DVD direct from them, and was happy to pay the premium over Amazon's discount to own this wonderful piece of movie-making and follow along with them in their crazy and amazing adventure in a gorgeous, surreal and somewhat desolate environment. What makes Hunter's movies so distinct are the great, ""ordinary"" American people that they run into on these adventures. This beats any Hollywood movie out there with its character development, drama, independent music soundtrack and cinematography. This is truly a movie that you will want to watch again and again, *not* just sit there on the shelf with all of the other movies you don't watch. ;)",1284422400,3,1155,4.7227722772277225

4229447,5,B003YJ8NBM,"This is a great documentary of a very hard to cover race.  I've been following the race for the last few years over video call ins and SPOT tracking, and this documentary helps take it one step further in seeing what the racers experience.  And it does an excellent job doing it.  I watched it a second time with my wife, who sat down thinking ""Oh god, he's making me watch another bike movie.""  She was near tears at parts of it and was surprised at the end that ""it was good!"".

The sound track is extremely well down too.  Very suiting to the shots and really adds to the environment.

4229460,3,B003YJ8NBM,"Kind of a mixed bag. I'll give you my $.10

I've ridden a lot of the northern route at various times since about 2006. Never the full route at one time. None of the NM area. Frankly, as described in the movie, there are some very boring stretches when you wish someone was there with you. That leaves the landscape as your primary entertainment which can be extremely beautiful. And you have to remember in 2009, there weren't many people racing the TD. Last month over 150 were at the grand depart. Bicycle companies now have bikepacking / adventure specific hardware. So the TD and bikepacking in general have become more mainstream in a lot of ways. That affects the movie today.

The movie falls short in three ways:
1. Scenery... didn't seem to capture it very well at all. It's way more beautiful than shown.
2. Personal stories... pretty thin and not well developed. really wanted some more personal stuff.
3. The difficulty of the ride as a whole was glossed over. Just did not address it enough visually or in a quantifiable way.

Looking at the movie 6 years removed, the amateurism of it all really does match what the TD event ethos. Self-supported, kind of off the grid... grass-roots style. What the movie lacks is also why it's endearing to the TD around the release date (2009-2010). I'm sure in another four years, this movie will be a touchstone. But in 2016, the TD different. So different that I think they should either make a new movie, or a sequel.

Use the movie Meru as a guide to capturing the three shortfalls above. Get more rider-produced content in the story.",1469491200,,1589,4.604240282685512

4229464,5,B003YJ8NBM,"An entertaining and informative view of the ""Ride the Divide"" race. It is the film ( bike) version of ""Born to Run"".
It follows devoted bicyclists in a race no one seems to pay much attention to, except other bicyclists. This is
a race that should be getting more attention. The scenery, alone, is worth the viewing--and the film makers have
edited it well so that it keeps moving along and the characters and their challenges are compelling.",1466208000,,442,4.67948717948718

However, the over all execution of this documentary was rather weak most likely due to a limited budget and/or crew. Too many times someone has to explain an interesting event that has taken place instead of us audience members actually seeing it. The main 'characters' are underdeveloped because of this. Still, there is a great documentary waiting to be made here because the ride itself is just that cool. Overall, not a bad watch if you're into adventure biking.",1462665600,2,610,5.1

Filming the GDR had to be a huge challenge as it is a race like no other.  There were certainly times when I wished the crew could have captured certain shots and even parts of the race (Banff snow crossing) that we weren't privy to, but that's the nature of this unbelievable event; no race banners and support stations, no fancy sponsorships and some of the most unrelentingly beautiful terrain.

4229522,4,B003YJ8NBM,"Ride the Divide follows the 2008 Divide mountain bike race south almost entirely through the US from Canada to Mexico. The doc follows some of the racers at various stages and really gets its strength from the cyclists themselves and their incredible 15 to 20 day journey. This is less a ""bike race doc"" and more a ""human endurance"" story. Unfortunately there is not much about the route itself, bikes, or gear that the riders are using. It focuses on the riders and their ability to cope with the challenges of food, tiredness, health/fitness and even boredom and loneliness. In that respect it is somewhat like a reality TV show, but much better.  The focus is on 3-4 riders (even though more started the race) and I really enjoyed the stories of the riders and felt like I was riding with them. I liked their openness and candor during interviews. There are many ups and downs both physically and emotionally on this journey. I thought the doc captures this aspect very well. Although all the riders are quite inspirational, one in particular is especially driven and so well suited for this course. I did find myself cheering for all of the riders.

As for the documentary itself there are a few points to note. I would have liked to have seen more of the route and scenery with some history, just for context at the start. During the race the name of the rider was not always listed during interviews or shots and, with all of their gear on, it was sometimes hard to tell who was who at the beginning. Only later, when cyclists start dropping out of the race, do you become familiar with the participants. The documentary maps out all of the riders' progress on the bottom of the screen with dots along a mapped route, but you do not know who the dots represent so it becomes a bit pointless. Finally, I thought the doc missed an opportunity to address one of the themes: loneliness. There seems to be two ways to ride the Divide, in a group or by yourself. There is some coverage of these styles and on dealing with loneliness, but the focus is on the solo cyclists. I found myself cheering for a group of riders that formed later on in the race (although I am not too sure because there is very little coverage of this group). I would have liked a contrast between the solo cyclists and the group cyclists, to show the dynamics of these two styles, but this is just my personal observation.

SUMMARY: Ride the Divide is quite engaging and the physical journey these people undertake is well worth watching. The focus is on the riders themselves and less on the route and techniques. I had a few issues with the style of the documentary noted above, but I think these are minor compared to the goal and end result. It really is inspirational and I applaud the creators. Finally, the soundtrack is superb and fits with the feel of the documentary. One song, ""July"" by Amy Petty, is a highlight of the show. Although my review is a 4 read it as more of a 4.25/5 (85%).",1371081600,,2972,4.489833641404806

4229528,3,B003YJ8NBM,"I had very high hopes for this video documentary of riding the continental divide with a mountain bike from Banff to Mexico, unfortunately, I was disappointed.  While the scenery is pretty, the organization of the documentary showing the individual riders was confusing, and may I say, amateurish.  The bikers set off in Banff in June, and the purpose is to be the first to the Mexican border.  I was confused from the very start.  The bikers were not introduced in a formal way, so the viewer hardly knows anything about the riders - I am still left wondering how many started.  An effort was made in the beginning to document who was in the lead and so forth, but that was abandoned about mid-way through the film.  The film focused on three bikers, the eventual ""winner"", and two others.  There were many more bikers, and some are shown in brief segments, but for the most part, the others are ignored.  Why? I don't know.  There were no cameramen, except for a fellow in a car, and apparently he did all the camerawork.  While some of the camerawork is quite good, he obviously could not be everywhere at once, so for most of the ""race"" he concentrates on just three riders.  How much better to have more cameras and more experiences of the bikers.  Perhaps the budget just would not allow for more, but in any event, the lack of cameramen made this video appear amateurish.

If you happen to be a biker, especially a mountain biker, perhaps this will appeal to you, otherwise, skip this program.  There really is no drama, no anticipation, no uplifting theme.  It's basically a matter of who has the endurance to finish the marathon ride.  I would not want to watch it again, nor see the sequel, should there be one.

4229530,4,B003YJ8NBM,"As other reviewers have noted, Ride the Divide doesn't spend the bulk of the time showcasing the scenery.  It's not designed to be a National Geographic special or a voiceover documentary.  Instead, it focuses more on the human story:  Up close and personal tracking of several participants, their unavoidable up-and-down emotional struggles, and the logistics of completing a 2,800 miles race.  I thought it did a nice job of capturing real emotions, which would undoubtedly be a mixture of excitement, hope, cynicism, boredom, and routine.  Calling it ""reality TV"" and the implication that it is somehow fake or overly dramatized would be far from the truth.

Catching scenery on a route like this is unavoidable, of course, and I wasn't disappointed with the video used to represent the trail.  Cinematography was professional and the soundtrack was very well done, so much so that I used Shazaam to find the closing credits song by Amy Petty called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/July/dp/B001DBRRLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">July</a>"".

If you're outdoorsy or even if you're not but wanted to experience the beauty and loneliness of the unspoiled country left to us in this great land, then this is a journey of film that will take you there; as much as any documentary can within the scope of the time frame designed for movies.  The only weak area for me was in the denoting of locations along the way.  While each segment indeed was captioned, there were spectacular stretches of trail that could have been described more as they rode.

There were, for me,  two entries that stood out in this race of personal challenge and of course, since both finished it had to be that way, but there were distinct differences in the way they finished (and I might add that that they both had wonderful, supportive families that let them be themselves):

**  Mary - the only girl - gutsy but wavering, (and with good reason due to physical malfunctions) she needed moral support all the way, got it, and that was what pulled her through in the end more than her appreciation of the unparalleled beauty she was riding through.  At least that was how I saw it.  Whatever works.

**  Matthew - the one who finished first - had completed this grueling event several times before, loved it enough to return year after year to test him self again - and was a truly amazing individual from all the facets of his personality.  His calm determination, his conditioning and preparation, his endurance and unassuming self confidence were all spectacular; but what impressed me most was his understanding of himself and why he was doing this; his down deep enchantment with the beauty manifested upon every aspect of the land he was riding through, each few miles taking him into another scenic vastness - of wind, sky, mountains, plains, high desert, each of a remote, unspoiled splendor which he could appreciate for its own special uniqueness; and managed to express himself to the viewer in few yet powerful words.

There were some subtle nuances too, that the film makers let the viewer feel out for themselves:  the words ""they were bored"", ""no fun without someone else"", and electronics blinking in the background seemed to somehow figure prominently in those nuances.  It's all in what you want to put into it what you get out of it.

I enjoy most well compiled documentaries, but this one held a special place for me as both of my boys mountain bike, and in my minds eye I could visualize both of them tearing up the trail just off camera on this journey of beauty and self motivation.",1354579200,2,2593,4.638949671772429

4229538,5,B003YJ8NBM,I've been on a endurance event film kick lately and Ride the Divide is one of the best. The scenery is beautiful and the story is emotional and compelling. The fantastic soundtrack is a perfect compliment. Some reviewers complain that there isn't enough film of the actual race but I thought there was plenty and more importantly this movie is about more than that. The pain the riders went through and the emotions they felt was very effectively conveyed. I also recommend the film Bicycle Dreams.,1334880000,,498,4.8023255813953485
4229539,4,B003YJ8NBM,"I really enjoyed this documentary. There is scenery but also a good deal of focus on the the ride itself. Close ups of what riding the trail itself was like. I have seen some reviews commenting on lack of scenery. I however, appreciated the more up close telling of the story. The body breaking down during the first 10 days. Once the riders get past that and the body adjusts to the rigors, then its the emotional and mental challenges experienced as the divide between riders became greater too. You can see the awesome beauty surrounding them. You see the pains they are enduring. Beauty and Pain are two things we long to share and there are times these riders are so very very alone and it was intriguing to see there endurance and wonder what metal you're made of yourself.

I had a special treat when I got to view this at the theater in Concrete, WA. Hunter Weeks (director) was present and allowed an audience interview after the  viewing. The interview shed even more light on some of the riders that I think should have been included in the film. However, it's still a great documentary and I think Hunter's future productions will continue to improve.

There are interviews with a few locals along the way as well. Hunter says that they got to spend quite a bit of time (3hours or more) with some of them. You come across these people in the back country and ""you're like what do they have to offer? But after you spend time with them they become unforgettable. You learn amazing things about people and it really changes how you start seeing strangers."" I'm glad they included some of those moments in the documentary too.

I think this is Hunter's second or third film. I know he is currently working on two other productions. I look forward to viewing them as well.

Also, the soundtrack was very appropriate to the race as well. Many of the songs I had never heard but was impressed with how fitting they were. I had thought, ""my goodness, did they go all out on having songs specifically written for this?"". No. But they chose music from local artists along the Divide. Pretty cool that.",1330128000,2,2104,4.54089709762533
4229540,4,B003YJ8NBM,"I enjoyed the film. It was a bit simplistic (no Hollywood special effects or big-name actors), but it doesn't need them. I understand the intent / genre of this film is that of a documentary. I was drawn in by the three people the film maker targeted, especially Mike Dion, as I too am a parent of young children. I could see myself experiencing similar emotions if away from my family for so long. I found myself pulling for each one of the racers.

While I agree with some of the reviewers that Mary bitched and complained perhaps more than others, she was just being herself. That is the human condition. Who cares? In the end, this event reveals one's true character and we all have our flaws and strengths - adversity exposes attitude. Even though Mary seemed somewhat negative at times, in my opinion, she made the biggest comeback in my eyes... good for her - I respect her for it. Well done, Mary!

Matthew Lee was a self-aware machine; well-suited for riding for long, isolated periods. He didn't seem to get flustered at all - he was calm, cool and appeared laid back like a Zen Master; whereas almost all of the others seem to cling to anyone else (speed up; slow down, etc.) to avoid that isolation - either consciously or unconsciously. His interviews and interactions really showed me what the race is about (a positive mental attitude) and revealed just how important previous experience is! (I heard he took 30+ days to complete the race his first time; then came back to win it the next few times in 17-18 days)! Neat to hear his wife was pregnant and due just after the race; I wonder how that has changed his perspective now? As someone who comes across so introspective, this would be good fodder for a follow-up project - perhaps an annual recording of the event?

I gained important insights on the overall race. Aside from the 'common sense' ingredients consisting of the requisite fitness, bike prep, mechanical and riding ability, the biggest thing I learned was the importance of the the psychological angle: mental toughness is something one needs - in spades - to complete this race! I never thought about how being alone in the wilderness for extended periods of time has the capacity to affect most people. (One of the racers is interviewed in a hotel lobby. The camera comes up on him from behind while he is on the computer - when he turns around, he has the wild-eyed appearance of someone suffering from PTSD).

I think people are so used to being 'connected' to society / civilization (how many of you reading this DON'T have a cell phone?), that being alone, without anothers companionship as a safety net, strikes fear into most. If you can't call for help on a phone, or have someone 'right there' to commiserate with, how do you respond? As someone who has considered doing the race (or as a ride) myself, I really found that interesting and something to be aware of; that I would need to develop coping strategies in advance. I also found that Mary's comments about how after a while, the beauty of nature becomes ho-hum... BORING... and you keep asking yourself, ""Why do I keep doing this every day? Why don't I just quit?""

So much time to think can lead to tough questions and even tougher answers. One of the riders refers to the race as a vision quest and I think he hit the nail on the head. Maybe that's part of the attraction. No doubt, undertaking something of this magnitude will change you; regardless if you finish or not.

All said, I enjoyed this film very much. The scenery was brilliant and after seeing the suffering and the joy, it inspires me to inch closer to participating in this event!",1316304000,9,3648,4.587423312883436
4229541,4,B003YJ8NBM,"I saw this at a benefit function.  Really a good show of the drama involved in racing this long, dramatic race.  The scenery is beautiful and the director tries to build a human drama and does a pretty good job.  But the weakness is the shoestring budget.  It doesn't show up in the cinema photography.  But where it is totally lacking is in only having one camera crew.  Early in the movie they lose all the riders so what do you show?  With two crews they could have spread out and covered more of the riders in more depth.

The fascinating part of this is not the riding.  It's watching the riders hit the wall mentally and resort to tears.  Very fascinating how fragile the human mind is.  I STRONGLY recommend this for all bike riders and nature lovers.",1301184000,3,758,4.381294964028777

4229543,5,B003YJ8NBM,"After watching ""Ride the Divide"", huge and epic seem inadequate to capture the magnitude of the Tour Divide mountain bike race. Perhaps the film's closing notes better convey it: ""Fewer than a 100 people have attempted...less than 40 have made it."" Indeed, the race is both huge and epic, and then some. But what about the movie?

""Ride the Divide"" documents the 2008 race. As you might expect, the film educates you about this ""underground"" event, introduces you to the racers and takes you along the route with plenty of beautiful scenery and drama. But what I did not expect was to become so engaged in the race through this movie -- almost to the point of hoping it wasn't really finished at the Mexican border and that the racers would turn around and head back to Canada! (My apologies to the racers for even thinking that.)

As far as story, the movie focuses mostly on a small set of the riders and engages you in their race. At times it got confusing keeping track of scenes with racers other than the few, and it was difficult to keep track of the status of the race. But you realize that the movie is not so much about a race to the podium as it is about ""the ride of a lifetime"", whether you finish or not.

While the Tour Divide is a race, it's also a journey. And on a journey, one meets colorful characters. ""Ride the Divide"" shares some of those special moments. One of the most memorable is in the mountains of Montana where we meet Larry the short-logger. He tells us he has ""spent many hours in front of a campfire and believe me, you get much better thoughts than watching Seinfeld or Oprah"".  Indeed.

Sometimes when I watch films like this, I'm inspired to try to do it myself. But I think in this case, ""Ride the Divide"" did a good enough job of conveying how epic and huge this race is that I will be satisfied with watching the film instead.",1296172800,,1866,4.381502890173411

8409405,3,B003YJ8NBM,"It was okay......... now, having said that, I LOVE a cycling documentary, so I figure I got my 2.99 worth from it.  however.... although same director, it just wasn't up to Inspired to Ride which I've watched all the way trough at least three times now.  The characters in Ride to Divide either weren't as interesting as in the other documentary, or the director didn't do the character development that was so awesome in the Inspired to Ride.  I would recommend this documentary to anyone who loves cycling documentaries, but don't expect it to be at the same level of enjoyment as Inspired to Ride was.  What I took away from this film is I would never, never, NEVER want to ride the divide, while I am actually contemplating riding the Trans America cycling trail some day.",1488326400,,776,4.642335766423358
8409406,5,B003YJ8NBM,I am always inspired by this movie.  It follows 5 or 6 people and their experience riding the Great Divide from Canada to Mexico much of which is on dirt.  No sag wagons or assistance of any kind.  I think this is my favorite bike riding movie of all time.,1484784000,,256,4.08
