8196752,4,B000QQH53I,"This is a triple feature package made up of two movies I was familiar with and one I was not, ""Leaving Las Vegas"" which is the reason I am reviewing this triple package.  My concern with this feature, though the story provides incite into a very difficult subject, is I was surprised at the onset to see x-rated scenes indicating I was not going to be watching a story for children.  At age 65 I am not unaware of how the world turns and usually I read the reviews at IMDB but as I purchased this unit to get the other two movies (the Usual Suspects and Escape from New York) I hadn't done my usual research.  Possibly I might have avoided the purchase if I had read at IMDB and would then have missed a movie well worth watching with a not to be missed ""educational"" story line.  As it was, I managed to find myself surprised.  The story is actually excellent, one that causes you to think of a part of existence you may or may not be intimate with.  I am glad I proceeded into the movie in spite of it's beginnings.  Nicolas Cage is a favorite of ours and now I can say I have seen more of him than I had ever expected to see.  I have to say my biggest disappointment is the double sided silver disks on the balance of the three movies.  I had much rather have DVD's with a photo surface on top but for the price paid, the package is a great buy.",1254268800,5,1348,4.095057034220532
