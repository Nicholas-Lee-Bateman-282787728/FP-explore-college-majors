4596240,5,B0057GUH46,"Was hesitant on buying this product from Canada because I am not fond of this company's past blu ray releases. Alliance is known to release their blu rays in 1080i and not the ""true"" 1080p that most (if not all) films are being released in. I am one of those picky viewers that demand studios to make their films look their best in HD. I can watch cable if I wanted to see these films in 1080i or 720p. Not sure what these are on blu ray, but they look quiet good. And they sound really good too (DTS-HD). It is worth the price to get all four films in one nice collection (without breaking the bank). Just wished the first Scream was the unrated version with the few seconds of gore added back in.
These discs actually look about the same as the single discs released here in the US. Just in a compact packaging with each film on its own disc (plus a fifth disc of special features). Each disc snaps onto a plastic spindle without having to slide the discs in and out of a cheap cardboard package. Great packaging for a great collection. If you are a Scream fan, get this collection.
Glad I did.",1362009600,10,1096,4.248803827751196
4596241,4,B0057GUH46,"This is it, 'Scream' fans! This is the set you've been waiting for!

This Canadian import (which plays absolutely fine on a US Blu-Ray player) collects all 4 'Scream' films AND includes a bonus disc featuring 2 feature length documentaries-- ""Scream: The Inside Story"" (a 90-minute making-of the first film) and ""Still Screaming: The Ultimate Scary Movie Retrospective"" (a 90-minute making of the first 3 films). The 'Scream 4' disc also includes all the special features available on the stand-alone US release.

In most of the world, it's not possible to purchase a set w/ all 4 films bundled together. There are rights issues that have split the series between parts 1-3 and 4+. However, Canada doesn't have this problems which has paved the way for this set. So, until the rumored 'Scream 5' is a go, this is definitely the ultimate set for any 'Scream' fan! It's all housed in a very nice cardboard box which features a full-sized Ghostface mask staring out at you. Now, since this is a Canadian box set, there is French writing on the box. I find it very easy to ignore and not nearly as intrusive as most Canadian releases I've seen.

The set is so close to being perfect. If only they had gone the extra mile and included the Director's Cut of 'Scream.' However, I'm not sure that's available in HD anywhere in the world. As far as I know, the highest quality the Director's Cut has ever been released is Laserdisc in 1997. For a die hard fan this will be a negative mark against the set.

So, if you're looking for a set that will look great next to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-30th-Anniversary-Box-Set/dp/B001CZJKS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween: 30th Anniversary Box Set</a>&nbsp;and/or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-The-Ultimate-Collection-Parts-I-VIII-Jason-Mask/dp/B005D7E80S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection (Parts I - VIII + Jason Mask)</a>&nbsp;then this is for you!",1326240000,32,2051,5.64935064935065

4596288,5,B0057GUH46,"This is really the only way to get all 4 Scream films in one blu-ray set.  The scream Trilogy set is available in the U.S., but because of copyright issues, there are no sets that include part 4 (at least not one that is easily available).  This set, which is the Canadian import, has all 4 films, plus a stand alone bonus disc with the 2011 special features that were included with the Scream Trilogy.  It plays just fine on blu-ray players in the United States.

Scream, was of course the movie in the mid 1990s that led to the revival of the horror film, which was part homage, part parody.  It was a film that made fun of the horror movie genre, referred to itself in parts, and did it all without being overly bloody from beginning to end and keeping the suspense a larger part of the movie than even the violence.  3 of the 4 films were written by Kevin Williamson (the creator of Dawson's Creek) and all 4 were directed by Wes Craven.  The main stars of each movie were Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courteney Cox.  Many great actors played ancillary characters or even had cameos in the series like Drew Barrymore, Henry Winkler, Carrie Fisher, Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and it served as a launching pad for actors like Portia De Rossi, Liev Schriber, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart,  and Heather Graham.

None of the movies are really overly complicated.  Scream 3 did get a bit silly and was I think reaching when the reveal of the killer was done in that movie.  And I do think that was the weakest of them all.  They were, at their core, a basic who done it serial killer movie.  There was always a lot of misdirection going on, and trying to get the audience to think that anyone and everyone was a potential suspect.  They were all violent and bloody, but not like the the more recent horror porn movies that, in an attempt to amp up the shock value, go so extreme with the violence and gore.  All the movies also inject a bit of comedy into them usually via David Arquette's or Jamie Kennedy's characters, and can be very much tongue in cheek.

For extras, all the movies have deleted scenes, outtakes/gag reel, behind the scenes and making of features, and commentary tracks on the movies with Wes Craven and one or two other people, usually producers but Kevin Williamson did the track for Scream, and Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere and Neve Campbell were included in the commentary for Scream 4.  There is also the aforementioned stand alone bonus disc.  So there is a lot there for those who like going through the extras.  The movies look good on blu ray, especially part 4.  Given the age of the first three movies though 1996, 1997 and 2000, the transfer quality for those are not as good.  If you are a fan of the movies, it is the best way (at least to this point) to get all the films on blu ray in one set, and the most inexpensive (if Amazon has it in stock, not going through third party sellers it is about $13).  Since there are not likely to be any more movies now that Wes Craven has passed away, and the fact that the 4th film under-performed the way it did, this may be the best of the 4 film sets we ever see.  I would definitely recommend it.",1465689600,19,3237,4.410774410774411

4596358,3,B0057GUH46,"Horror film franchises rarely get box sets or deluxe treatment but this release could have been better. The advantage here is that you get the complete 4-film Scream canon, two documentaries created in 2011 (90-min ""The Inside Story"" and 90-min ""Still Screaming: The Ultimate Scary Movie Retrospective "") all on 5 discs. The 5th disc houses over 4 hours of total bonus content but the director's cut of Scream is not included nor do Scream 2 and 3 get the red carpet treatment (most of the extras focus on the original and Scream 4). Still Screaming is the better of the two documentaries and it is not sold separately. Admittedly, the picture and audio quality are fairly good.

The 4th disc on the Scream Trilogy 2000 DVD Boxset contained the following bonus features not included here:
Scream [18 minutes of bonuses]
Production Featurette
Behind The Scenes Footage ('On The Scream Set' & 'Drew Barrymore')
Q & A with Cast & Crew ('What's Your Favorite Scary Movie' & 'Why Are People So Fascinated by Horror Films?')
Commentary by Director Wes Craven & Screenwriter Kevin Williamson
Special Effects Gallery (Images, Pictures & Stills)
Film Facts
Scream 2 [20 minutes of bonuses]
Behind The Scenes Footage
Scream 3 [37 minutes of bonuses]
Outtakes
Behind The Scenes From All Three Scream Movies (Scream, Scream 2 & Scream 3)
Deleted Scenes
Alternate Ending
Music Video ""What If"" performed by Creed

It seems none of the Blu-Ray box set releases have all of the extras (deleted scenes, commentaries, etc.) that were housed in the DVD set (the 4th disc is missing). Also, not all the bonus content from the BD standalone releases are included (except 45 minutes of Scream 4 extras, deleted scenes and a commentary). ""Still Screaming"" is the only exclusive feature so the deluxe treatment won't be found here. The other Blu-ray collection, Scream Five-Film Set (Scream 1-3 + Two Documentaries) is the same thing without Scream 4. The real advantage to this collection is if you want to own all 4 Scream films in one set with a couple of documentaries, some bonus content for Scream 1-3, lots of Scream 4 extras and a bonus collectible mask. This Canadian collection works just fine on US Blu-Ray players but it may not on a Playstation. Perhaps more extras will be released along with Scream 5 in the future.
