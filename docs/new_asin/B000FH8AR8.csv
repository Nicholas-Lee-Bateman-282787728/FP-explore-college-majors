8159156,5,B000FH8AR8,"A fantastic ensemble performance, including Colin Friels and Bill Hunter. Set in contemporary Melbourne it depicts the breakdown and transformation of Tom White from successful middle class architect and husband to a down and out bum. Perhaps the transistion is too sudden however it captures the horror of discovering you aren't the person you used to be and your past is lost or not connected to your present. Excellent effort from Alkinos Tsilimidos.",1174435200,,453,5.219178082191781
