8049850,5,B0007OY334,This is obsolete. The Wild Child DVD has everything on this plus more. Great stuff though.,1423094400,,90,4.6875
8049851,4,B0007OY334,Again I am very satisfied with my purchase. So far I have never had a complaint. Thanks again.,1273708800,,94,4.277777777777778
8049852,4,B0007OY334,"I was expecting more from a set that claims to be ""The Complete Sam Kinison,"" but it's still a great colletion of classic Kinison.  If you're a fan, own it.  However, don't make the mistake I did, and buy it without realizing that I already owned one of the CDs included in this set.",1268092800,,283,4.222222222222222
8049853,5,B0007OY334,"OK, There is a out of print VHS release called ""Banned!"" taped at the Felt Forum,  with Sam's music videos of ""Under My Thumb"" and ""Wild Thing."" It's not here.  Another now unavailable VHS of a show from Vegas is only excerpted.

That said, this is a fine set.  Sam's two wonderful aired HBO specials are included.  All the bits you remember and plenty of laughs. There's also a terrific previously unreleased show from San Francisco.  I saw him that same year, and this show blows away the one I saw.

As for the extras, readers of Bill Kinison's ""Brother Sam"" will appreciate his commentary track for the shows.  There is some rare standup that is a great addition to the set. I would have preferred more bonus standup material instead of the included vacation footage, which I consider a waste of time.

How can I complain, though--it's Sam!  He was the best of the post Lenny Bruce/George Carlin/Richard Pryor comics, period.  It's about time his video work became available again.",1171238400,6,985,4.701754385964913
8049854,5,B0007OY334,"First off, I like the price.  I had been wanting to buy Kinison dvd'd for some time to add to my collection, but the price tag for the box set or individual dvd's were too high for my liking.  Then this set comes along, collecting ""Breaking the Rules"" and ""Family Entertainment Hour,"" along with the special extras that came along in the COmplete Sam KInison box set that collected these two titles, but this set also includes the new release ""Outlaws of Comedy."" All of this for the same price of just one of the single dvd releases.

The only thing that I feel is missing is ""Sam Kinison: Banned,"" what would have been his second HBO special, but HBO decided that it was too over the top for them to release on the air.  This is the special that oincluded Sam's ""Wild Thing"" video, as well as a couple of his other music videos.  Hopefully, this may be on the horizon.

If you want to add Sam to your collection, this set is the right buy for you.  I was not disappointed, though the sound quality on ""Outlaws"" is kind of lacking, it was clear that it was not taped professionally, but this does not deter one from enjoying Sam's unique comedy.  Highly recommended!",1124323200,17,1167,4.395348837209302
8049855,1,B0007OY334,Very disappointed.  The famous routines I was looking for are not on this set.  I didn't like these routines. Look for mine on Ebay cheap.,1123804800,4,138,4.48
