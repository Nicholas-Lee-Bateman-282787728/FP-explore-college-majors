1406052,5,B000059H8Z,"A romantic comedy set in old Mexico complete with moonlight desert nights, cactus silhouettes, and enjoyable music.  Life-loving Leo Carrillo (Cisco's Kid's Poncho) misguidedly decides to modernize his bandito operation (sombreros, guitars, and burros) after watching American gangster films.  The plot twists playfully from that premise into kidnapping and matchmaking.  Every bit as delightful as Mamoulian's 'Love Me Tonight' in its loving attention to detail, this film is a visual pleasure.",1095638400,13,495,5.943661971830986

7933524,4,B000059H8Z,"***Possibly a plot SPOILER or three***

The notorious Mexican outlaw Pablo Braganza (Leo Carrillo) harbors two great passions. A rabid enthusiast of American gangster flicks, he seeks to emulate them hoods on cinema and to remold his gang of rough bandidos into a more modern ""organization."" So, suddenly, cue the Yank wiseguy slang spilling from Braganza's lips. ""So you won't talk, eh?"" he says to one offender. ""Okay, give him the works,"" he says.

You get the first inkling that you're in for something fairly removed from reality when, during the film's opening scene, the camera pans across a movie theater audience composed of Mexicans, most of them sporting big, view-obstructing sombreros. Braganza and his minions are in that audience, and it's not too long before they start a drag-out, knock-down brawl. The theater manager quickly orders his employee Chivo - played by Italian opera star Nino Martini - to quell the riot with his golden tenor. And here's when we learn of Braganza's other great passion: an unadulterated appreciation for great singing, of which Chivo delivers.

THE GAY DESPERADO, a 1936 joint, is a sparkling, comic south of the border operetta, helmed by the masterful Rouben Mamoulian and featuring a smart screenplay that parodies silver screen gangsters and those old Mexican bandido westerns. It's a fun mashup. The fearsome bandit Braganza is so impressed with Chivo's singing that he extends him an invitation to join his gang, never mind that it's at gunpoint. Braganza does Chivo a solid, I guess, when he commandeers a local radio station and plants Chivo in front of the mic, at which point Chivo belts out a lively rendition of ""Celeste Aida.""

The plot thickens when Braganza abducts an American tycoon's sniveling heir and his spirited fiance Jane (Ida Lupino, in her blonde phase), these two having snuck across the border to get married on the sly. Chivo, forced by Braganza to be point man in their snatching, doesn't exactly set a good first impression with the girl. This is key because the plot now makes room for a romantic angle, never mind that the third wheel, that spoiled son, is still around, oozing a yellow streak. Jane gets a sense of the cut of her fianc's jib when he implores her to be ""decent and a little nice"" to Chivo to increase the odds of his getting away. The plot thickens even more when Seor Butch, ranked Public Enemy #3 in the States, decides to move in on Braganza's operations.

While Ida Lupino's spunk is swell (and she's never looked lovelier) and Nino Martini's pipes soar to magnificent crescendos, Rouben Mamoulian's directing deserves most of the accolades. From the opening moments of the gangster film within the film, we're treated to his vibrant visual techniques, to his brilliant staging and composition. He effectively manipulates shadows. He frequently props his characters in stark contrast against a backdrop full of sky, and this produces a dramatic panoramic effect. And, throughout, he maintains a light touch. This is a spoof, and my eyes widened at that epic slapfest cum furniture fight in which Jane and Chivo hurl various household objects at each other. The excitable Nino Martini is ostensibly the lead, but he has to work hard to not get his scenes hijacked by Leo Carrillo who is tremendous here. Carrillo and Harold Huber come up with some of the film's most amusing verbal back-and-forths, with Huber's sour, unimpressed sidekick fearless in correcting his jefe Braganza. Also fun is Mischa Auer who is almost unrecognizable as the sleepy-eyed Spanish Indian, Diego, who hasn't spoken a word in ten years. And if the wit and levity and dynamite direction aren't enough, Martini's warm operatic voice might be the decider. He takes on not only ""Celeste Aida"" but also ""Cielito lindo"", ""Adios mi tierra"", and ""The World is Mine Tonight,"" this last soon becoming his signature song. Jane's sniveling fianc referred to Chivo as ""...just another mush-voiced radio crooner,"" but the opinions of sniveling fiancs don't count for jack.",1351382400,2,4036,5.008941877794337
7933525,5,B000059H8Z,Lots of fun and fine singing.  Great to hear those Mexican songs done so well by opera singer Nino Martini who made several movies.  Nino gets kidnapped by Carillo into his gang of bandidos because he loves Nino's singing which broke up a riot at a movie theatre....plenty of funny character actors and even a ladies trio in the radio station studio which Carillo hijacks to display his new singer on the air.  Lots of fun as crooks from both sides of the border match wits.,1285977600,2,474,4.488372093023256
7933526,4,B000059H8Z,"One of those rare instances when I just happened on a box cover at the local video store, and it ended up being something I'd never heard of but had to see - and then to own.  I've seen just a couple of other films from director Rouben Mamoulian, but though I've liked them a lot the real draw here was lead actress Ida Lupino, in Hollywood for just a couple of years at this point and still looking very young and fresh at 18 or 22 (depending on the source - her birth is still a source of some dispute).  Lupino has become an absolute favorite for me, but I haven't looked really hard at her early years, and I had no idea that this obscurity was on video. It really shouldn't be so unknown, though I can see how it wouldn't appeal to an enormously wide audience, or even to a large subset of those willing to watch 30s films.

Basically what we have here is a Mexico-set western-gangster-musical-comedy, a crazy and wonderful mix of genres that I'm coming to believe was especially popular in the Depression/early sound era of the early-to-mid 1930s. The previous year provided one of my favorite examples of genre-bending, the science fiction-western-musical THE PHANTOM EMPIRE, and the musical-western, musical-gangster film and other mash-ups that seem pretty odd today were commonplace during this era.  Anyone thinking that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER invented the idea of mixing seemingly disparate styles and stories into one narrative really needs to take a look at this era's films.

THE GAY DESPERADO begins in a movie theater (so there's also the self-referential back-lot theme going on, think Busby Berkeley or some of Mamoulian's own earlier films) somewhere near the border, with a group of desperados watching an American gangster movie, their leader Pablo (Leo Carillo) deciding that he wants to be more professional like the Americans. For some not very well explained reason he thinks that capturing a radio singer, Chivo (Nino Martini) will help his cause. He tries to teach Chivo the ways of banditry - and have him become his own personal singer - and then captures an American couple, Bill Shay (James Blakeley) and his fiancee Jane (Lupino) and tries to ransom them to Shay's rich father. Many songs, car chases and horseback chases, escapes and recaptures follow. The songs are a mix of operatic classics and Mexican folk songs and are all nicely done; Lupino is just gorgeous and charismatic and talented enough to pretty well dominate most of the scenes she's in; and it's nice to see the Mexican bad guys eventually decide that they don't really want to be like the more ruthless - and humorless - American gangsters that they eventually run up against, instead turning the American public enemies in.

So all in all we end up with a light satire on Mexican bandits, American gangsters, and the Hollywood musical form, reasonably fast-paced despite some of the songs feeling a little awkwardly placed; a frothy, weird and fun concoction that has to be one of the most pleasant surprises I've had this year.",1255478400,5,3034,4.802681992337165
7933527,5,B000059H8Z,This is a great classic.  The lead actors do a fantastic job and the musical numbers are awesome.  Very entertaining.,1254182400,2,117,4.8
7933528,5,B000059H8Z,"Knowing that Rouben Mamoulian, one of the great film directors of the Twentieth Century (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Love Me Tonight, Queen Christina, Golden Boy,...), had directed this not widely known film and being the Musical Genre on of my favorites, I always had an ""eye"" on this movie.

I'd define ""The Gay Desperado"" as a wonderful and entertaining spoof with musical interludes, set in the Mexican Border, where the notorious, funny, charming bandit Pedro Braganza (who's a music fan, very funnily played by Leo Carrillo) and his gang try to imitate the American gangsters' ""modern ways"", kidnapping a singer (Chivo, played by Nino Martini) in the process.

I must note that Nino Martini is the only member of the cast who actually sings, profusely, in the film, getting to sing some popular Mexican songs and an Operatic Aria among others.

Martini has an impressive voice (you can tell he was a real Opera singer from the Met) and a mischievously charming personality. Leo Carrillo more or less steals the film as the florid leader of the Mexican bandits with an ""ear for music"". Very funny performances too by Harold Huber as Carrillo's more serious sidekick and by great character actor Mischa Auer (of ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""You Can't Take it With You"" fame), who impersonates a silent native (almost a ""Buster Keatonish"" character) who's part of the gang too.

Ida Lupino is very good (before her later ""Warner Bros. Screen Persona"") as an American girl who has just eloped to get married in Mexico to a rather wishy-washy, stiff fianc, getting both to meet Carrillo's gang face to face.

Great cinematography, pace, mood and dialogue (IMHO this is no ""ordinary"" musical) in a beautifully restored transfer (IMAGE made a great job).",1118448000,14,1743,4.914965986394558
