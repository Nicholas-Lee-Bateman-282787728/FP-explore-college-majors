6445212,4,B00KSMTJNY,"Fairly well acted and played, suspense managed well. My son was disappointed that Disney embellished the Hardy Boys books' characters by adding some disrespectful speech, behavior, and conflict that are not in the original texts -- and I am a bit disappointed by this also. There are a couple of scenes that are more offensive to today's audience (rightly so), such as one boy's rough (physical) treatment of a neighborhood girl who is annoying him -- a product of the ""tough guy"" image of that era. Parents can make the call whether to talk that through with young viewers or pass until there is more maturity to know where to draw the line in real life. Overall, fun nostalgia, and an original Mickey Mouse Club episode included.",1407369600,3,731,4.7637795275590555
6445213,5,B00KSMTJNY,"My wife and I watched this over two days recently, and it was a lot of fun. Both Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk were fine teenage actors, and brought a sense of realism to this mystery that it frankly didn't deserve. The story is a simplified version of the first Hardy Boys book. The brothers are put out that their father (Fenton Hardy, a PI himself) is having to continue to work in the city. But they shortly find a client of their own (two, actually), in a search for a chest of 3000 gold doubloons that were stolen from a crotchety old neighbor ten years ago.

Disney was at its best 60 years ago with this kind of kids programming, but as we just proved, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it!

6445225,5,B00KSMTJNY,"One of the earliest ""cliff~hanger"" type serials on the old Mickey Mouse club; watched this originally in the fall of 1956 as a 3rd~grader and wished I could get into adventures like this!!!
