a very enjoyable movie. More than i can say for todays movies.",1200700800,,133,4.583333333333333
884609,2,630446083X,"Anyone who has read the book will look forward to a bright, inquisitive, chatty and charming little girl.  I was very disappointed with this portrayal of that character.  She didn't talk much, she didn't seem to have much personality at all.  As far as following the story line, I understand they always have to make some adjustments for Hollywood, so I won't pass too harsh a judgement there.  But when the main character of the story is bland, I just have to whine.  Luckily there are other versions.  I'll try another.",1190592000,6,521,4.670329670329671
884610,4,630446083X,"Fine acting, wonderful scenery, and a very pleasant approach to the classic tale make this quite an enjoyable film. Though the character of Fraulein Rottenmeir is a far cry from Johanna Spyri's, as is her relationship with Herr Sessemann, this change may be appealing for those who wish to share the film with children, who might be troubled by the original.

My reason for witholding a top rating is that, as a lifelong fan of Johanna Spyri's ""Heidi,"" I noticed that some of the key themes in the original are missing. Heidi's simple faith, and her faith's being strengthened despite the time of dreadful homesickness and mistreatment by the governess in Frankfurt, do not come through clearly. The plot has been revised so that Herr Sessemann is an uncle, Fraulein Rottenmeir a lovely lady, and Klara (in the book, a gentle sort crippled by over protectiveness) a bit of a brat. Heidi remains in Frankfurt because she feels she owes it to Klara, who tends to move her legs when Heidi angers her.

All told, nonetheless, this is a very well acted film with a great deal of charm.",1128643200,31,1080,4.708994708994709
884611,5,630446083X,"Why I like this version over others: I found this a charming rendition..perhaps too sweet for some , but a refreshing change for a family movie without all the usual modern contentions. Lovely vistas of the Alps, although other modern versions excel more in this. Jennifer Edwards makes a prettier child than some future versionsand Jean Edwards as the governess makes a nice addition also. There is no evil Frau Rottenmeyer and the drama comes from surprise conflicts such as a more irritable Clara. I like the other Shirley Temple version too but felt like the movie was created as a back drop for her rather than the little actress supporting her role for the plot. Even if you have a favorite version, it is fun to have another so different. Enjoy",1106784000,3,751,4.696969696969697
884612,5,630446083X,"Trivia from the IMDB: This was the TV adaptation of ""Heidi"" that, through no fault of its own, became embroiled in a U.S. broadcasting brouhaha known to this day as the ""Heidi game."" On Sunday, 17 Nov 1968, the NBC television network was scheduled to begin airing ""Heidi"" at 7pm Eastern Standard Time, following coverage of an American Football League game between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders.

The game ran long; however, with the Jets leading the Raiders, 32-to-29, NBC broke away to begin ""Heidi"" on schedule. During the remaining minute of play (which was extended by penalties and timeouts), Oakland managed to score two touchdowns, and ended up beating New York, 43-to-32.

Outraged football fans inundated NBC switchboards. The network expressed regret, saying it had intended to stay with the football game until it ended, and blaming a series of miscommunications for the gaffe. A result of this fiasco is that NFL television contracts require games to be televised in their entirety. This game is now immortalized as the ""Heidi game.""",1100476800,12,1058,5.04
884613,3,630446083X,"This version of Heidi was my absolute favorite movie as a child.  I have the VHS version and decided to upgrade to the DVD.  I couldn't believe it when I started watching it that the first part of the film is not even included.  We don't see how Heidi got to her grandfathers, met Peter or his grandmother.  I don't know if it is somehow a mistake on just my movie or if they are all missing the first scenes.  The quality of the rest of the film was fine and just as good as I remembered.

This version shows Heidi to be as strong-willed as her stubbern gradfather even though she has no one to care for her.  Furthermore when she goes to live with her cousin Clara, the characters all go through the transition of bringing her into the family -especially well done by the actress of Clara.

884660,1,630446083X,"The quality of the copy was poor. It was very fuzzy. I remember watching this movie as a child and I suddenly remembered my mother and I complaining of the many flaws and deviations from the book. All the drama has been stripped. Herr Sesemann is now Heidi's uncle and Alm-uncle agrees to let Heidi move to Frankfurt. Dete' part is dimiminshed and she is somehow  the grandfather's daughter? Grandfather is Heidi's maternal grandfather instead of maternal and too many inconsistent strange departures from the book. The main complaint is a dull Heidi, bereft of any of the spunk, emotionality or passion in the novel. Shirley Temple with all her corniness is closer to the heroine described by Spyri. The plots adds a storyline changing Frau Rottenmeier to a pretty kind governess who falls in love with Herr Sesemann. The storyline is a major deviation from the book and a bore. Heidi sleeping walking and  Frankfurt grandmother are absent. Peter is never fully developed. The best part of the film was an over the top Klara trying to walk, gripping and  clutching her fists into the grass. As children, my brother and I thought this was hilarious and today it is still ridiculously melodramatic. And why do we have a blonde fair Heidi with pigtails when the book describes her with short curly black hair and darkly tanned skin with some Romancische ancestry? Sigh. Save your money and time there are better versions available.",1474848000,4,1429,4.848360655737705

Another reviewer claimed it was missing the beginning part of the movie--that was not the case with my disc, which was the one with the cover art shown, red border around light blue background with an oval portrait of Heidi. I read the book Heidi when I was a child but only dimly remember it so I cannot really compare it to that. But I am pleased with this for the purpose I bought it for, a parish DVD library for Catholic catechism students. There is a kindly Franciscan friar priest in the film who is a very positive character who believes in Heidi's' crusty old grandfather's heart and helps many lives to heal.",1474588800,,743,4.511111111111111

If you are under 30 years old the film may seem to have a very slow pace because it is in sync with natural timing of dialogues.

Likewise, there is enough romance and suspense for older kids but not so much as to bore or confuse younger ones; a story line clear and linear enough for small children but not boring to older ones; sufficient but not intrusive emotional content and social commentary, etc. Altogether, this is a treat to watch, as I did with my grandchildren repeatedly for several years as they grew up.",1377129600,2,731,5.0

Jennifer Edwards might be a little too big for the role but she is so charming that you forget about it.  Michael Redgrave was perfect  as were Jean Simmons and Maximillian Schell.  Schell is so handsome he is worth watching the movie for.  This DVD has not apparently been remastered but seems to have been restored to some extent as it is quite an old movie and this DVD when played on my 60 inch t.v. still looks lovely.  Not as sharp and crisp as a fully remastered film but there are no scratches or fuzziness.  It may not be a total telling of the actual book because, as I said, I don't remember it all that well but it is a completely charming movie that I think everyone will enjoy very much.

It's worth noting that this was not filmed for the cinema, but rather for living room viewing.  Although the picture quality isn't that of many newer movies and certainly not HD, it's still a grand old and endearing classic worth watching and good enough for my weary eyes.  The acting is superb. If you enjoy watching classics that haven't been doctored up and made surreal then you'll love this version!

884781,5,630446083X,"I have seen all the Heidi film versions and this one is the best overall.  Just as in Captains Courageous, the 1930's film with Freddie Bartholomew, Mickey Rooney, and Spencer Tracy captured the essence of the book without strictly following the plotline as written.

 So too, this film version gives us the spirit of Heidi, which, although not as bubbly as Shirley Temple, is loving, steadfast, obedient, and cheerful.  I think that the slightly more withdrawn part of her personality fits with her unstable upbringing, as she was shuffled from home to home and had no choice but to obey her Aunt Dete.  Her withdrawal seems to be natural under those circumstances.  The alm uncle (grandfather) is reserved because of past hurts and resentment in his life.  A real positive of this movie is that he attempts to resolve this inner conflict.  Now that he has a dependent in his life, he sees that his conflicts will be detrimental to her, and so out of love he works to overcome past issues.  He becomes a fine role model of a mature adult by the end of the movie.

Clara is delightful (was it easier to find good child actors in the 60's and 70's?), Ms. Rottenmeier is a little too charming (but it works), Sebastian the butler does a fine job, and Clara's father, Mr. Sesseman is also excellent.  It is tough to single out a poor actor/actress in this version.

For the record, my copy was VHS so I don't know if the DVD has been cut or if the picture quality suffered.
Skip the 1993 Disney version.  It gets a little hocus pocus and does not have the feel of the book.  Heidi is petulant and worldly.  Peter's grandmother's part is very poorly written.  Clara and Peter are also worldly.  The book is absolutely charming.  What a contrast !!!

See my review for the 2005 version as well.  The definitive film has not been made.  Masterpiece Theatre or BBC ought to tackle this project !!!!!!!!!",1273622400,5,1896,4.566765578635015

I loved the way they portrayed the love for the mountain in this movie and the grandfather's spiritual connection with the eagle was magical to me as a child. Admittedly, this probably isn't the most exciting version to watch. Even I will admit the pacing is slow, and the action is mild in this movie. But the personalities the characters have and the little bits of their stories that you get to see, are very interesting. I loved their choice of actress for Heidi in this movie as well, I think she was a perfect fit. I know that they messed with the character of Clara by making her a sour, entitled child instead of the sweet character I believe she is supposed to be. However I don't think that ruins the movie, it's just a different take on how her character would have been affected by her past.

The DVD itself is fine. I don't think we'll ever have lovely high def quality of this film, but the dvd is about a standard quality. No worse than a VHS copy.",1509753600,,1134,4.299065420560748
7872062,1,630446083X,"Review of Heidi
Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

Good God, lets just hope Shirley Temple didn't watch this version. Its so horrifically bad, its as if the screenwriter and director absolutely hated the original and decided to make the worst possible version of the story. Its really hard to imagine a worse interpretation.

First off, the lucky little girl cast to play the title role was homely, awkward, unendearing, and a lousy actress. It was her first movie, and I have no idea how she caught such a lucky break. But if you're fast-forwarding every time Heidi comes on the screen, that doesnt bode well for you overall enjoyment of the film. Next up is Michael Redgrave as Grandfather. Grandfather is supposed to be a notorious recluse who hasn't interacted with anyone in years. Michael Redgrave doesnt act like a hermit in any way, shape, or form. He has no trouble adjusting to his granddaughter, and he frequently interacts with other characters in the film, with no lapse in social graces.

In the story, Heidi lives with her grandfather until shes taken to live with the wealthy Herr Sessemann and his crippled daughter Klara. In the original, Klara is endearing and delightful, like her curly headed companion. In this version, shes also homely, a terrible actress, and her character is written to be a spoiled, mean-spirited brat. How can we root for someone like that? Also, in the original, Frauline Rottenmeier, Klaras governess, is the unequivocal bad guy. In this version, Rottenmeier is not only played by the beautiful Jean Simmons, but shes a good guy! There is no bad guy in the movie, and half the movie deals the romance between Rottenmeier and her boss Herr Sessemann, a plot point that was nonexistent in the Shirley Temple version.

I kept fast forwarding through this horrible, horrible movie, until, at the very end, I got the giggles, consumed with the dreadful thought that it might not ever be over. Just save yourself. Watch the Shirley Temple version.",1500940800,,1983,4.8579881656804735
