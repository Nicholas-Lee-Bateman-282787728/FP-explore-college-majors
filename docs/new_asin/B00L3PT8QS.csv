8663631,4,B00L3PT8QS,"The Amazon listing is a bit lacking in description of what this actually is. I had hoped it was a collection of the videos related to the album, but actually it's a documentary about the production of the album. The documentary turned out to be quite interesting, but if your French skills are a bit limited, beware that there are no English subtitles available at all.  Also this is a bit unusual format of a North American region disc but with PAL encoding, so it might not playback with good quality on some players... I watched it on an Xbox One though and had no problems.",1422403200,,577,4.443396226415095
