8079186,5,B000ARXGC2,"Delightful! Charming! Family Friendly! This delightful Christmas offering provides a visual bonus as Flicka visits with the folks in this Austrian village. Flicka sings with her usual clarity and provides us with a Christmas program that will be a favorite for years to come. Filmed a long time ago when Flicka's voice was at its youthful best, you won't be disappointed. Just watch out for those birds. I wondered why the bird received soooo much camera time. I began to wonder what the bird knew about the camerman. This is another of those Christmas DVDs that you'll watch every year.",1305244800,,587,4.88
