8250883,4,B0013GN4L2,"It will be a different experience for most audience, since the movie is very unique.
It has both political, social as well as spiritual undertones.
The barrenness of the desert is in stark contrast to what we, the audience who are watching it in our living room, are used to. The minimalistic arrangement of life, and despite lack of material clutter how joy, laughter, emotion and human drives grow and flow, worth pondering. The strength of the movie is in its mystical appeal.
All the characters acted extremely well, even the little boy.
If you accept the movie the way it is, you will like it. It's a poetry, and poetry is often difficult. The movie will take you to a different world. I have no suggestion for the director or the producer--since I have no idea what to say. Could it be improved? Possibly. In which way? Hard to tell, since any modification would have been a deviation from what I experienced and that might have modified the total essence that I am basing on to write this review.
I recommend you watch it, but watch it in intervals, rather than in one or two sessions.",1314144000,2,1092,4.548223350253807
8250884,5,B0013GN4L2,"A dying old man and his granddaughter engages in a journey through the desert in search of a meeting. Meanwhile through this arid environment, he will tell her about the fable of the prince that contemplated his soul through the limpid water of an oasis.

Both stories shake hands along the way and we will witness admirable lessons of life and unforgettable Sufi metaphors - like the beautiful story of the three butterflies around a candle - for instance.

Beautifully filmed, admirably choreographed and zealous directed. An admirable work of poetic intensity all the way long.",1221264000,13,580,5.03125
8250885,3,B0013GN4L2,"When you first watch Wanderer's of the Desert, you are hit by the starkness of the desert landscape and immediately transported to a semi-mythical village somewhere in the Tunisian desert. I found that I had to really pay attention to the film's story and I must say that it does indeed require concentration to fully appreciate a some sort of spiritual message that Nacer Khemir is trying to portray. I gave this review 3 stars because of the uninteresting extras (A picture gallery tat are just stills from the film). I would have loved a director's commentary so that I could analyse the film more and perhaps an interview with Mr. Khemir himself. Other than that I would recommend it for someone who wants to watch something different.",1211846400,9,739,4.78125
