7980139,4,B00008973U,"This workout is very old school, but I loved it.  The moves reminded me of something I would have done in a step class years ago (grapevine anyone?).  There are lots of different sets so it keeps you from getting bored.  It definitely gets your heartrate up and helps you get a real workout.  It's not a yoga/stretch class.  It's a workout tape.

Pre-pregnancy, I did not work out frequently.  I want to stay healthy and have an easier delivery so I am going to work out religiously during my pregnancy.  I have found many videos don't really give you a work out.  They just stretch your body and pamper you too much.  Labor is a marathon.  I need to train for that.

The instructor is a little annoying.  She says ""one more time"" several times and then proceeds to do the step another 3 - 4 times.  After the first time through the tape, it gets easier to follow.",1232409600,,864,4.31875
7980140,4,B00008973U,"This workout is very old-school, in their outfits, production, and the aerobics routine itself, but I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I actually felt like I got a real workout.  The instructer is beautiful with a very soothing accent.  There is a lot of diversity to the routine.  You get a good cardio and weight training section.  There is absolutely no breathing cues, and I wish there was more lower body work in the toning section, but its overall very good.  There is a cheesy relaxation section at the end that I didn't do, but the nice thing is the DVD is divided into sections so you can do all or part of the workout.  I also sat on an exercise ball for a little extra kick during the weight training section (she has you on a chair).  All you need are hand weights and possibly a resistance band.",1217721600,3,799,4.387755102040816
7980141,3,B00008973U,"I just rented this video from Netflix and found that it was exactly what I was looking for in a pregnancy workout video.  I am six months pregnant and a lot of the pregnancy workout videos are VERY boring!  This one has you moving around on your feet with a wide variety of activities.

The only caution I give is that if you're not familiar with some workout moves such as the ""grapevine"", you might find this workout hard to follow at first.",1094947200,6,443,4.313253012048193
7980142,4,B00008973U,"I really enjoy the intensity of this workout.  I think it's completely possible to keep up with.  The warm-up and cool down section are about 7 minutes each.  The cardio section is 20 minutes not the 30 minutes in stated in another review. I also have Leisa Hart's pregnancy workout in which I love the dance moves, but it gets really repetitive.  Gloria Quinlan puts a lot of variety in the moves so that you don't get bored.  I was also pleased that it had a weights section.  The weight-lifting segment is intense enough to help you maintain muscle tone without being unsafe for you and your baby.",1081296000,5,600,4.5092592592592595
7980143,4,B00008973U,"I've been using this workout video since my sixth month of pregnancy.  I found that it was just what I needed to add a little variety to my work out.  She starts with a segment of warming up, then follows with three segments of aerobics and dance moves, and a great cool down.  There's also a couple segments that focus on toning arms, legs, and abdominals (all of which are completly safe for you and the baby).  The first couple times I used it I was having trouble staying with her dance moves, but by the third time, it was a no brainer. I'm very pleased with the video and would recommend it to anyone that wants to add some variety and excitment to their personal workout routine.",1074816000,8,686,4.3359375
7980144,1,B00008973U,"I bought this video because I wanted to add some variety to my other pregnancy workouts. I have the Leisa Hart Pregnancy workout and The Crunch Yoga Mama both of which I love. This was fairly new and I have a Crunch workout led by Gloria Quinlan called ""Latin Blaster"" which I have always enjoyed.
First off the speed of aerobics in this workout paralells the intensity of my regular videos which means I was not able to do the whole thing. It left me dizzy, out of breath and miserable. The description on the back of the tape states there is a warmup (15 minutes), aerobic section (20 minutes), and cool down (15 minutes) that is a lie. The warmup is about 7 minutes long, aerobics is 30 minutes long, PLUS an additional 10 minutes weight lifting section (which you don't know is coming and are unprepared for) and the cool down is about 5 minutes. The cool down is completely insufficient it doesnt stretch your muscles at all nearly what they need. Plus the aerobics section is very hard. I used to workout 2-3 hours a day before pregnancy now I am able to do an hour. This tape still left me unable to do it because the intensity is too much for anyone but an athlete in their pregnancy.
All I have to say is the production is poor, its unsafe and misleading to read the back. Dont waste your money, don't waste your time and either get the other two I reccomended or just take a nice walk!",1062460800,33,1395,4.32824427480916
