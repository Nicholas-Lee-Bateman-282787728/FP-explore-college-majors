8446751,4,B004XC5LW8,"Lilla is the 15-year -old daughter of Allison and Will. Will Now goes by the name Travas, and is an operative for the Sou Beil military. Lillia doesn't know that he is her Father though. Treize is the son of Fiona and Benedict . They have been friends since childhood, but Lillia doesn't know that Treize is royalty. The 2 friends go on vacations together and always seem to get into trouble, usually because Treize is a prince. Fortunately,they are the children of heroes, and they always seem to get bailed out by their parents.

This volume is pretty good, but isn't as good as volume 1. The story is fun. There are lots of great plane fight scenes and some train hijackings. The 2 new characters, Treize and Lillia aren't quite as interesting or charismatic as their predecessors. Despite this, the story is still quite enjoyable. The old characters are still very involved in the series, so it still feels like the same show. My 2 complaints are the ending, and the lack of an English dub. The end of part 1 was very emotional and dramatic, but part 2 is kind of a let down. I also really wish that they had dubbed this show. I would have enjoyed it much more if I didn't have to focus on reading subtitles. Sentai is kind of bad for not dubbing their anime titles. Despite these couple things, I really enjoyed this series. It's good clean fun for almost any anime fan.",1360800000,,1375,4.4563492063492065
8446752,5,B004XC5LW8,Great if you live the timeframe of airplane fights and adventure a must see. Being the second part of the tv episodes not having a failure in the plot still kept me interested.,1354579200,,176,4.363636363636363
8446753,4,B004XC5LW8,"Its been 15 years since the end of the first half of the series. Allison lives alone with her daughter Lillia, but she is dating a very nice man from the Sou Beil army... But this half of the series is about Lillia and her mysterious friend Treize from Ixstovia. Their first adventure starts during summer vacation....

The second half of Allison & Lillia is  closely patterned after the first half. Again it is split into 3 primary story arcs and again the over theme is a love story between one very capable person and one very, very, clueless person. The story arcs aren't as strong as ones in the first half, and Lillia is nowhere near as capable or likable as Allison. Fortunately, Treize picks up the slack and carries almost the entire story on his own. In a way it makes sense - with Allison as a mother, Lillia doesn't need to be as self reliant as Allison had to be in the first half. Treize being who he is, he probably need to learn lots of things to keep his options open. But I still wish Lillia had been more likable. And smarter.

In the end though, part two still held much of the charm of the first half. It is interesting to see how the passage of time affected the world the characters lived in. And Treize is a cute character. If you liked the first half, then you will at least enjoy the second half.

PS In case you were wondering about the source material - Allison & Lillia is based on a trilogy of light novels. There are also two manga series based on the light novels, Allison (1 volume) and Lillia & Treize (2 volumes).",1319673600,,1548,4.291095890410959
8446754,5,B004XC5LW8,"The story continues with the children of the two couples from the first generation, and with it the political intrigue and adventure inspired by mid-20th century espionage and warfare. As this ""season"" aired immediately after the first, the theme songs are the same, but the opening and ending animations are different. The voice actress for Allison, Nana Mizuki, performs her daughter Lillia in this series.

Like its predecessor, there are three major arcs to the story, each spanning about 4 or 5 episodes. Whereas the first generation had somewhat of a World War II feel to it, this generation is nominally at peace, with tensions ever threatening to spill over into open war again-- the adventure and politics reminded me somewhat of Cold War action/espionage TV shows of the early-to-mid-1980s. Because the second generation is itself a full story in its own right, you don't need to watch the first generation to understand everything, but there are hints of the earlier series.

I originally saw parts of this series late at night on one of NHK's digital channels while working in Japan, and the broadcast was accompanied by a sort of ""late night theater"" program that occasionally featured interviews with the cast and crew of the anime. While I only got to see some of the story each week, the solid animation visuals and soundtrack provided an immersive, almost cinematic feel. The character design and bright colors convey a playfulness that complements the lighter moments and overall thematic elements of the series-- but personally I thought the character design didn't mesh very well with the highly detailed environment. Overall, however, a very well-assembled production and performance, and a great addition for those who love adventure dramas.",1316217600,,1763,5.160839160839161
