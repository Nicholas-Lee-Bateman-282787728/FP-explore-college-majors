Plays on American Dvd players too!! Thanks especially for that!",1287446400,,107,5.0
3545186,5,B001E181XC,"Catherine Tate has got to be one of the most versatile and talented performers from England since Tracey Ullman.  I have bought all of her seasons and the Christmas special as well.

Nan, the grandmother, is one of my favorites and to hear her rake poor Charlotte Church over the coals was hilarious.  Charlotte must be such a good sport as well as a mega talent to appear on this special.

I've watched this over and over and each time it makes me laugh out loud.  I hope Catherine Tate continues to make more seasons.  All of her characters make me laugh.",1260835200,3,557,4.411764705882353

3545190,3,B001E181XC,"We have enjoyed Catherine Tate's regular TV shows on Netflix. This one is her Christmas show - as enjoyable as her usual program, but nothing special. A good value for the money, though.",1405209600,,186,4.666666666666667
3545191,5,B001E181XC,"My daughter turned me on to British humor. Catherine came after The Doctor Who series and I absolutely love that, especially David Tennant. But I took one of Catherine Tate's DVD's to a retreat I went on. It had no sound proofing and I was literally laughing out loud in my room to the point that others in the group wondered what the heck I was laughing at. I love her shows and all the different characters she plays. Bring it on Catherine!",1398297600,,442,4.337349397590361
3545192,5,B001E181XC,"If you're a fan, buy this disc. The sketch with Sam and Paul is worth the price, alone. I wish the special had run an hour, and I wish Niky Wardley had graced the screen longer (of course). Still, I'm standing firm on five stars.",1362182400,,229,4.111111111111111
3545193,5,B001E181XC,"This is one of my fav's for Catherine Tate. Every character brings it. Truly funny as &*^(*&()!
Love it. :)",1361750400,,107,4.4

We like all Catherine Tate Work, Yes We really like this tape. Its because we like all things Tate!",1361318400,,104,4.25
3545195,5,B001E181XC,"Not enough.  I want more.  Catherine Tate is  amazing. She mush have one hell of a mind.
The BBC should do with her what she does best, give her another show like she had.
Topical skit humor is great because you never get bored.  Its one after another.
If you don't care for one role she plays, wait a few minutes, another one will start.
Of all the funny things she came up with, I was impressed with the scared wife routine.
Really, who would have thought of something like that?  Truly unique in comedy.
Nan is my favorite.  They could make a full feature movie on just her.
Like Bean did for Atkinson.

The only problem with Tate is the typical 3 seasons BBC give shows.
Way too little for this kind of talent.",1358640000,,714,4.2444444444444445
3545196,5,B001E181XC,"If you like British sketch comedy, this is for you.  She has a myriad of characters that are soooo funny.",1358121600,,105,4.25
3545197,4,B001E181XC,"Very enjoyable.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that there was NO closed captioning.  Many products coming from UK do not.  This bothers me as I'm losing my hearing and find following dialog (especially wiht accents) hard to follow at times.  So, I missed some of the jokes.",1358121600,,284,4.509803921568627
3545198,5,B001E181XC,Living in the USA - I miss my UK humor. This is hilarious and gives me my fix. My American friends don't even understand her dialect let alone the humor. But I am bovvered.....,1357344000,2,176,4.205882352941177
8295930,4,B001E181XC,"For me, the Christmas Special is somewhat uneven although generally I like it. I much favor certain skits like those involving posh people over others which can border on the tiresome. Catherine Tate is undoubtedly very talented, and I'm amazed at the talent of the children who appear in skits.",1516406400,,295,4.92

8295934,4,B001E181XC,Well worth 4 Stars. some of the scenes were 'off centre' as far as I was concerned but others were great. Nan should run for prime minister - she would let the politicians know exactly what she thought of them.,1454457600,,210,4.275
