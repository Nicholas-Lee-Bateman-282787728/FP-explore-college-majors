8428677,1,B004GEB67W,Burn Gorman was only in it for a minute or two. For the producers to list him as a lead was pathetic play upon Mr. Gorman's fans. The rest of the movie was disjointed and quite horrible. The plot was impossible to follow other than one guy was scamming people.  Well the people who claim Mr. Gorman has a key role really scammed buyers. Not worth the money even for serious Gormaniacs.,1515715200,,385,4.347222222222222
