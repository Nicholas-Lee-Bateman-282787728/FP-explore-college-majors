8314326,4,B001K7Y4MC,"I THOUGHT THE SOUND WOULD BE MATCHED UP A LITTLE BETTER, BUT LIKE TO SEE MORE MEMPHIS WRESTLING DVD'S TO COME OUT!!",1389484800,,115,4.2727272727272725
8314327,5,B001K7Y4MC,"The entire 'Memphis' series of DVD's, released by Highspots, is remarkable in that they're entertaining AND educational. People who are interested in the roots of the pro wrestling, or 'sports entertainment', they watch today should invest in this collection.
This volume, although a tad less complete than the other volumes which mostly focus on early to mid-80's material, is nontheless imperative for wrestling fanatics. Everyone who was everyone passed through Memphis at some point during the 70's, and seeing Jerry 'The King' Lawler in his career infancy is always a blast. Talk about a guy born for the business!
Don't miss out on the 'Memphis' DVD set; all of them are well worth the money. Some, such as 'Lawler vs Austin Idol & Tommy Rich', 'Jerry Lawler vs Outside Invaders' (featuring wonderful angles and matches with Stan Hansen, Terry Funk, Jos LeDuc and more)'Lawler vs The Monsters', and 'Lawler vs Andy Kaufman' (still probably pro wrestling's most famous angle, and certainly one of the best and most influential) are indispensible.",1318723200,3,1051,5.188235294117647
8314328,1,B001K7Y4MC,"A little confused after buying the entire series of these DVDs. I thought they were going to be from master tapes or really good quality. Turns out, these are just from all the usual tapes circulating in the wrestling trade community. Nothing new here. Really disappointed.",1287273600,2,273,4.956521739130435
