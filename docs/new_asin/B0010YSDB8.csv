3055834,1,B0010YSDB8,"This was a documentary about an exhibition that made it seem that the entire German army in WWII, without any exceptions, were guilty of war crimes and the reactions to the exhibition. It was very much in favor of the documentary and against any one who complained about it. As for me . . . Give it a rest already! Like the German old man said, How many times do we have to rehash and re-rehash the same old tripe? Do other countries do it? Do the French? The Russians? The Israelis? <snicker>

German leftists may enjoy rubbing their countrymen's noses in the feces (while simultaneously ignoring or excusing the crimes of the Communists in East Germany) but I don't see the point, especially when it's been done so many times by so many people. Enough is enough. The problem is that they are on autopilot; after all these years, it really hasn't sunk in that the Soviet Empire is through, so there is no need to continue being anti-patriotic.

Incidentally, I read somewhere that the exhibition depicted in the movie was called off after it was found that some of the pictures taken of atrocities were not by the German army but the Soviet army. <snicker>",1311724800,12,1157,4.584541062801932
3055835,5,B0010YSDB8,"As a student of the German side re WWII for over 10 years, If there is one issue that just hits me like a sucker punch, it's the continuing ridiculous notion that the Wehrmacht was a simple bystander to the ""solution to the Jewish problem"". (Now known as the Holocaust) Almost everyone, officer or above on the eastern front, knew what was happening and the others heard of at least rumors.

While Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich were cunningly secretive about the genocide- they could not (nor could the SS) carry out such killings without the participation of the military. While I understand these older men not wanting to burden their families with such details, I hope the now elderly Wehrmacht soldiers don't expect everyone to be so nave.

The SS was the primary organization yes, but supporting roles were needed and filled by numerous organizations including the Wehrmacht and Todt Org.  I hope these men come to a point that they can be proud of their legitimate military accomplishments, while standing up to and taking responsibility for their moral failures.

This DVD itself, while not perfect, does a good job at raising the main issue. Why highly intelligent, motivated, ambitious, polite, good humored men- willingly followed the command of total paranoid psychopaths?  Commands written and verbal to murder, kidnap women and children, and to destroy the evidence. (Commands all semantically vague, manly, and heroic- of course) And why did they try to lie about it, knowing there are thousands of witnesses?

The Wehrmacht veterans I'm sure would love to take the accolades for victories, while pinning the moral failings and military disasters on Hitler /the SS. As with nearly everything related to this war, it is not that simple. They are only delaying the healing process of themselves, the victims, and generations of Germans that come after them.",1286150400,14,1869,5.0519480519480515
3055836,5,B0010YSDB8,"This documentary, designed for modern German and Austrian audiences, is startling, and for Germans born in the 1950s and 1960s it damns the older members of their families with a universal war guilt sometimes far beyond anything they can imagine. For some Germans, it is indeed cathartic to air the dirty laundry of the past; for others it's absolutely necessary, and for a third group, it can be a tragically horrid experience. This documentary rocked Germany's socks. I was a Fulbright Professor of History and American Studies at the University of Muenster in 1995, just when the Hamburg Exposition exploded on the scene. It did much harm as it did much good. Some old Wehrmacht soldiers, once proud of their wartime service, could hardly look their families in the eye. In a higher view of World War II, it does tell an essential and sad truth: that the wanton destruction of innocents including the premeditated wiping out of an entire people throughout Europe cannot be forgiven easily regardless of how much time has passed since 1945.",1224201600,20,1042,4.926136363636363
3055837,5,B0010YSDB8,"Until the full extent of German complicity--civilians and soldiers included--in the atrocities of WWII are revealed this nation will never be free from the considerable shame wrought by this time period.  We should keep in mind too, though, that there were German resistance fighters and that most attempts on Adolf Hitler's life were committed by German citizens/military.

""The Unknown Soldier"" is a particularly disheartening documentary on the 1995 Wehrmacht exhibition that took place in Vienna (and opens periodically every year those who care to take a look) which reveals pretty clearly that all members of the German army were either aware of or took part in the atrocities and mass shootings of civilians usually relegated to the SS or the Gestapo.

The obvious place of the Holocaust in the German psyche is shown very clearly as people outside the exhibition shove each other around, scream, and passionately debate about the accuracy or non-accuracy of the material presented in the exhibition. At one point a group of nearly toothless skinheads and right wing nutcases show up flying the Iron Cross and insisting that the whole thing is nonsense and that ""the press lies"".

Not so, it seems.  Four German historians, sensitive to the subject matter, uncover photographs of ordinary German soldiers standing next to executed jews (one photograph of a three year old jewish girl hanging is vomit worthy) and make it fairly clear that all German soldiers, Wehrmacht included, were given explicit instructions that they carried around on the Eastern front to shoot any of the ""rabble"" they encountered.  An aging member of the Wehrmacht admits very frankly that Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" captivated him for a time, and that he witnessed more than a few atrocities committed by the army. He also says very clearly that is ashamed of what he did and witnessed, and seems sincere.
What has long been suppressed is that German soldiers *were not* executed for refusing to participate in these atrocities; they were disciplined or were asked to work in different capacities.  This has long been known by historians but has never been given as explicit treatment as in this documentary.  And some Germans did just that; dropped out of the army entirely once that they saw what was going on.

This is not about all Germans being monsters.  Very soon this entire generation will die off and I think Germany should be commended for being so conscientious of these things, unlike some other nations who did very similar things and have never apologized once.  This is depressing and I would not watch it again, but is very important.  Recommended to any student of history.",1224115200,18,2669,5.040909090909091
3055838,3,B0010YSDB8,"Please read the product description and then read this, as I won't repeat the basic premise of the film. As someone with ties to Bavaria and a general interest in World War Two, this one jumped out at me from the library shelf. It seeks to address the culpability of the average German foot soldier regarding the war crimes that have made the War a low point in the annals of history. After watching it, however, I am left feeling a little less than ambivalent over it, thinking that it doesn't do justice to two aspects that is should have addressed.

First, the complicated thing we all possess called human nature, if there is even a human nature that we share, has obeyed more commands to do evil out of a herd instinct to obey than it has out of anger, religion or anything else. That is something that has been demonstrated time and again, famously by Milgrim in his shock study and Zimbardo in the Stanford Prison study, among many others. Humans will do almost anything to conform to herd expectations or the expectations of authority figures, even the greatest evils. This is a point that the director should have made strongly, showing it is not something unique to a certain type of German person to do wrong. It is universal. You and I would most likely not be the heroic resister, but the acquiescing accomplice. Face it; statistically it is true. Had that point been made, and it could have been, then we could have moved beyond the emotionalism of both sides that is a main feature of the film.

Second, while I have absolutely no sympathy for those who committed such atrocities, it is simply ridiculous, and offensive, to paint with such a large brush so as to implicate all of the German soldiers. Why end there? Why not all the German people?  Again, the evils done by such a large amount of Germans, and German soldiers in particular, must never be forgotten. However, assigning blame in such a swath is irresponsible, especially given the nature of the topic.

So in the end I feel that the exhibition is important and needed, but how you handle the documents, photos, testimonies needs to be more nuanced to be accurate and responsible. Give it a viewing and leave your own thoughts.",1218499200,8,2205,4.61734693877551
3055839,2,B0010YSDB8,"The subject of this documentary is the opening of the Wehrmachtaustellung (Wehrmacht Exhibition) in 1995, the now famous collection of photographs and documents that provided graphic evidence of German atrocities throughout the Second World War. What distinguished the exhibition from past scholarship on the 3rd Reich, was its depiction of the German Army, or Wehrmacht, as one of the main perpetrators of .the Holocaust - essentially no different from the SS, SD, or other Nazi organizations commonly associated with the brutality and mass murder of Hitler's regime. Although a full rehash of the Wehrmacht Exhibit isn't appropriate here, in short, the controversy that persists to this day is whether the photographs show individual acts of barbarism committed by German troops or, as the Exhibit maintains, irrefutable evidence of the German Army's complicity in Nazi crimes. In other words, are these photos proof that ordinary, rank-and-file German soldiers willingly, even enthusiastically, participated in mass murder? Or are these merely isolated cases that should not (or cannot) be distorted to represent the behavior of the over eleven million men who passed through the army's ranks?

Now to the documentary:

Scope: The film purports to provide an objective, balanced account of the Wehrmacht Exhibition, in particular the controversies over the exhibition itself, the public attention it aroused throughout Germany, and the circumstances of its premature closing due to inaccuracies among its photographs. In addition, the documentary attempts to further investigate the complicity of the Wehrmacht in Hitler's crimes and refute the notion that German Army had been a mere spectator, or pawn, during the Holocaust. To accomplish this, commentary from leading scholars, former Wehrmacht members, and Holocaust survivors would provide critique and broach a discussion on the merits and shortcomings of the exhibition.

Focus: From the outset, the film veers off topic from the original opening of exhibition and a discussion German atrocities and digresses to crimes committed by the SS, the first use of gas vans at concentration camps, and Auschwitz. Roughly 1/3 of the film consists of tangents on the mass murder of the Jews and the 3rd Reich's genocidal policies in the USSR and Eastern Europe. This desultory format is annoying at best - one has a hard time keeping track of the producer's arguments as the interviews and footage appear cobbled together with little forethought.  Moreover, no new material is introduced about Wehrmacht atrocities during WWII.

Objectivity: This is by far the biggest disappointment.  My hope was to see an unbiased, objective analysis of the Wehrmacht Exhibition and the subject of German war crimes under Hitler. I was looking forward to hearing feedback from historians and scholars advocating different viewpoints and walk away with new insights or at least a better understanding of the controversies this exhibit evoked. Instead, it was immediately clear which side the documentary took: while there was indeed a panel of respected history professors, authors, and politicians present throughout the film, without exception they were either directly affiliated with the exhibition itself or proponents of its overall message (I gave 2 stars because many of their arguments were compelling). Yet for counterarguments and critique against the exhibition, the film relies  exclusively on soundbytes and interviews from right-wing (neo-nazi) politicians, angry, shouting skinheads, and a handful of disgruntled veterans. One gets the impression that those who disagree with the exhibition's thesis are either poorly educated or neo-fascist hooligans. Of the 10 or so professors and professional historians that appeared, not a single one offered any substantive critique, rather they lauded the exhibit or diminished those who disagreed with their views.  The controversy and questions over Wehrmacht involvement in war crimes continue to this day. There are numerous journal articles and books written that by distinguished historians in Germany and the U.S. in criticism of the exhibition, and new research continues to emerge.  As such, I expected a degree of critical dialogue and some back-and-forth debates. Very disappointing.

Conclusion: Ultimately - a letdown.  One-sided, entirely subjective portrayal of the exhibit and the Wehrmacht itself, ""The Unknown Soldier"" doesn't offer any fresh insights or new arguments.  Unfortunately, it's the only English language documentary on this topic to date.",1207526400,95,4562,5.595652173913043
3055840,1,B0010YSDB8,"The creators of The Unknown Soldier once again take it upon themselves to rehash information that has been well known since the Nuremberg trial's. In short there is nothing new about this documentary that you can't find by Goggling it, or accessing Wikiipedia . It is a well know historical fact that the so called ""solders"" that were sent to kill were mostly members of the Einsatz Grupen. A group of murderers brought together by general Erhard Galen. The same Erhard Galen who was brought over to the United States via Project Paper Clip. It was Galen who worked with the state department to develop a little idea known as the CIA. Back to the Einsatz Grupen. These men weren't fit for regular service, so they were sent in behind the real army as part of the ""final solution"". The same final solution formulated by members of the SS, to rape kill pillage, and otherwise mame. Along with the help of their Catholic capitulators' in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Ukraine, and Russia. Yes folks lets not forget they had eager co-conspirators in this little venture. So much work, so few hands. Is the Unknown Soldier an attempt to honestly come to grips with a sorted national past? Or is it just another way for spineless surrender monkeys to bend over for the victor nations once again? Victor nations who's own sorted pasts' are far from laudable if we were to make a documentary about them. From the trail of tears in America to the atrocities committed by the British colonial army. As an ardent viewer of documentaries, and reader of histories I'm fairly sickened by the Micheal Moors' out there who take it upon themselves to bring us
 ""new "" information about a well known subject to those who study it. It also serves to cheese off the otherwise law abiding citizens in a recently reformed Germany fractured by the victor nations,and the Russians. Some balance of view points is what is needed in The Unknown Soldier. It's time to drop the all that is German is evil attitude. In and outside of Germany.",1204502400,18,2023,4.698591549295775

3055857,4,B0010YSDB8,"Compelling topic but documentary style is somewhat amateurish. There are also many scenes with crowds of people milling  around either in favor of the exhibit or against it with indiscriminate ad hoc interviews. The topic being the Germany Army (Wehrmacht) was complicit in the wholesale slaughter of Jews and Non-Jews alike before and during the Second World War. Their slaughter including non-combatants and prisoners of war.  it's focus is directed at the Army personnel, both Commander and Foot Soldier and their willingness to help perpetuate the massacres of millions of men,women and children either by execution or simply starvation. We do learn there were some Commander's who did not follow through with some of these atrocities  and we are told there were no reprisals for their non-action. I don't believe that is entirely truthful as I have read that by the end of WW II Hitler had replaced all but one of his original field commander Generals.

 In defense of the Army, there were many officers such as Hans Oster who were foundations in the German resistance which is  not evident at this exhibit. I think to be fair those brave men and women should have also been represented  as Unknown Soldiers. Most of them were executed for their attempts to end the Nazi regime.

3055892,3,B0010YSDB8,"This film explores reactions to Der Wehrmachtsausstellung (German Army Exhibition), two exhibitions examining war crimes of the Wehrmacht purportedly committed on the East Front from 1941 to 1944.  These were popular and extremely controversial exhibitions in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  The title of the second exhibition, a toned-down version, was entitled ""Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944 (""Crimes of the Wehrmacht 1941 to 1944"").""  That should tell you it was not a balanced portrayal.  Far from it. Certainly, there were Wehrmacht solders who committed atrocities.  But there were many soldiers who refused to commit such atrocities, even when repeatedly, and heatedly, ordered to do so.  The film discusses ONE such soldier, Josef Sibille.  Others obeyed without hesitation. Others obeyed because they feared the consequences.  Others because Befehl ist Befehl.  (""An Order is an Order."")  The German word for criminal, Verbrecher, is the most commonly used word in the film.  Certainly, and undeniably, horrible atrocities were committed on the Eastern Front.  But care should be taken in evaluating the film's suggestions about who committed what.

One of the ""historians"" behind the exhibit appears often in the film.  He comes across as a reasonable person who has marshalled evidence.  If one does his research, one finds he is a political extremist who was banned from public employment in Germany.  Yet, the Hamburger Institut fr Sozialforschung thought he was a good candiate to prepare the exhibit.  There were problems from the beginning. For example, numerous photos of atrocities supposedly committed by the Wehrmacht were actually commited by the Red Army.  Montages of photos that had nothing to do with each other were juxtaposed to be misleading.  This film presents his analysis and statements without giving any of his background.

I give this film 3 stars because it contains photos and accounts that must be remembered.  It presents the public's reactions to the exhibits.  It is an intersting starting point for those who want to explore the subject, but by no means should one think this film presents a fair, balanced view.

I think they made a good case that the myth of the ""good, common soldier"" existing was just that, mostly a myth. I believe after watching this that it could have been the exception rather than the norm. Very well thought out reasoning of how they wore the citizens and common folk down to numb them to the purge of the jews, and opened my eyes to the scope of how they killed them. My understanding was that they mostly went to work camps and were gassed. Hardly the norm, in fact probably the most common way was to round them up, take them out of the town/city etc, march them to a big hole in the ground or some naturally formed site where they could make them strip, then shoot them in the neck, making them lay on top of the last person they just shot.

My impression regarding this controversy over the honoring of fallen German soldiers begs this question... Who in their right mind can justify the actions of Nazi Germany and feel good about their sacrifice? Unmarked graves and accurate historic presentation drawing attention to the horrific nature of the Germany in WWII seems fitting.

Also, clearly evident Neo-Nazi movement is alive and well -- and that those who belong to that movement are not allowed to speak to media.

I think this was a decent film, and a real hard one as well. These are tough questions and their is some truth to both sides. It's easy to sit there and say everyone in the German army were all war criminals. Even if you do, it is still a hard thing to stomach either way and tension would be high on the stomach. Time doesn't heal all wounds and you do have to remember that the Germans lost a whole generation in the war and to starvation at the end of the war and had no break right on into the cold war. I'm not crying tears for them, they reaped what they sowed but you also have to remember the Nazi's and the Russians were the same homicidal monster and by the end most German's in the army were fighting not for Hitler, but for existance. A touch  subject for sure, but even with the above mentioned considerations, the difference is that the German's started it, and chose their path at that time. My applause though goes to keeping the memory alive because most of the world is trying to forget and the proof is in the pudding now with Russia's annexation of the Crimea and that black hole of death in the Deserts of Iraq and Syria. It is in Africa from Libya to Somalia and across the Red Sea to Yemen. It is in the Chinese Naval build up and lurking tensions with Japan.

It develops the idea that the average German soldier (not just the SS) participated in Hitler's attempt to exterminate of Jews.  It shatters the long and dearly-held myth among the German people that if your father, grandfather or perhaps even great grandfather was not SS, they knew next to nothing about it.  The footage is compelling, convincing, horrifying and truly heart-wrenching.  It needs to be seen.

It was not without hope.  There were a few Commanders (far too few) who categorically refused to go into towns and shoot every Jewish woman and child.  There were people who attempted to protest.  Few of these brave people survived.  But they should always be remembered.

Both really did not talk about witnessing those fatal tertiary civilian experiences they during 1939 to 1945, and no family member wanted asked about it and thus hoping to forget about it. Younger generations of Germans offer a variety opinions to the blame of the genocide era as they cannot ask the elders who were alive during this period what were the rammifications or reasons for such a disasterous state sponsorship of murder. Yet for that time period in the 1930's the German people elected a dictator from Austria, who in turn had the generals and soldiers of the army swear allegiance to him or suffer personal consequences. The army was now the strongest political arm and society adhered to it as it was considered normal to belong to the select choice of society, and not be singled out as an hated outcast. The Germany army as well as the general public did indeed participate in the genocide with direct or indirect involvement. Holocaust trains were given priority on all rail lines especially in the east to Wehrmacht trains much to the disdain of generals commanders. Wehrmacht trains sometimes sat for days in stations at rail sidings waiting for the trains to carry their victims to the camps to go by.

Even in history monarchies and democracies there similar issues of blame of similar genocide where their armies followed orders from the political supreme on direct orders to quell the people, and so the armies dealt with civil rule, eliminating cultural strife, and resettlements of state undesirables. Could it be worthy to say the US Army is solely responsible for any deaths of civilians being confined in the Japanese internment camps during World War II after watching this movie? The scope of American internment camps is not as large as what nazi Germany is responsible, yet expected mortality was not normal for people living behind confinement.

3056019,5,B0010YSDB8,"The only problem with this movie is its lame name.

It should be called: ""Simple German soldiers still shamelessly deny their complicity in WW2 atrocities.''

What is marvelous about (many) Germans today is the continued open discussion that allowed for a significant section of society to have self introspection. That makes those that accepted responsibility maybe the best humans on earth.

At the same time those that didn't are among the worst. There are quite a few of them in the movie.

As someone whose ancestry is 1/2 German-Jews and 1/4 holocaust survivors, nothing was new to me. My Jewish great-grandfather was a German hero of WWI and a city-council member in Nuremberg  - that left after Kristalnacht. From him and my grandmother I knew about the two-faced attitude of the Germans under Hitler. These were `his friends' until they almost killed him. From the other side of the family I knew about the enthusiasm with which all German soldiers moved to kill Slavs and Jews. They all facilitated the deportation trains, death marches, `partisan' annihilation. All of them. That was what every soldier knew the purpose of the war to be!

From 1945 and until reunification in 1990 NATO allowed this idiotic lie that ""regular Germans"" didn't know what the NAZIs and SS were doing. This was allowed so that Germans may help fight the Soviet union.  After 45 years of lying it is hard to admit that you were lying for so long.",1417910400,4,1434,4.828571428571428

3056035,4,B0010YSDB8,"I will first begin by saying that I am a combat veteran from the U.S. Marine Corps so I believe that I can speak with some degree of experience of the impact on men in combat.  I think they're are some real misinterpretations here.  I have read several of the reviews and I agree entirely with some and disagree adamantly with others.  Now I do think that the atrocities committed by the Germans in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia are an unprecedented brand of evil that we have never seen before in humankind, I reserve judgement to some extent to the basic fighting man.  I have been that basic fighting man so I feel I stand on some sort of common ground with them everywhere.  I do believe the SS, SD and Gestapo should forever be held accountable for their crimes so that this history can never be repeated.  I served in a conflict in which American war crimes have taken place against in a manner that should never take place.  But I also believe it's a major injustice to the whole of a fighting force for the actions of a few.  Now granted, the few in the Wehrmacht that participated in the Holocaust of Bullets is a larger number than the few in any other instance in history.  However their are millions of good fighting men that served in the German army that are not tainted by this history.  Most of these men that we are talking about are in fact just young boys trying to do a good job and defend their homeland from lies that had been pounded into their heads since they were children.  With that being said I think it is unfair to say that the entire German army during this time period were a bunch of blood crazed murderers.
  The mission of the genocide fell entirely on the shoulders of the SS.  The documents that Reinhard Heydrich wrote have proven that.  Now some of these mass murders were so large in scale that the SS couldn't handle the job so Wehrmacht soldiers were taken to accomplish these massacres.  There are further documents from HItler's lackey Field Marshall Wilhelm Keitel that the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front were to assist the SS and Einsatzguppen in any capacity the SS saw fit.
  You can ask any basic German civilian or soldier during that time frame that the SS were a terrifying collection of people.  It was well known that when the SS showed up on your doorstep in Berlin or on the Eastern Front that you cooperated in every manner possible or you would be dealt with appropriately, according to the old Nazi line.  So when the SS showed up at your unit and says, ""We need fifty men to carry out an operation.""  Every commanding officer in the Wehrmacht jumped and provided what was needed.  May I also add that on many occasions when the SS came to get their water carriers from the Wehrmacht they told them that they were going to be testing new weapons systems.  What 19 year old kid isn't going to jump at the chance to go test some sort of new military technology.  That's one of the best parts of being in the military.  Now the SS has their men and they take them to some remote forest where trenches have been dug and hundreds, if not thousands of people are standing around in groups.  The SS now informs you of your mission.  You have a serious doubts, not only to legality but the humanity of this order.  You then look around and see dozens of menacing, black clad SS officers standing around with rifles and machine guns.  What do you do now?
  It may be somewhat easy at our distant remove, and security of not being in the actual situation, to say that I would disobey this order and take whatever punishment may come.  It could quite easily prove that you would end up in the trench as well.  After all, the SS can't allow a non-cooperative dissenter to go back and tell the story when he didn't participate.  Now I know what most of you are thinking if you've indulged me thus far, participation through fear does not absolve you of the crime.  And I also know that some members of the Wehrmacht willingly and enthusiastically participated.  Does this justify the labeling of millions of others who did not participate as criminals.  Then it must be said that the American army is an army of thugs for the atrocities they committed by executing prisoners during the Battle of the Bulge and their many transgressions committed by only few in Vietnam and the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts.  Writing that alone was an affront to my pride as an American servicemen much to what I imagine it would be to those men in the Wehrmacht who did not participate and had no knowledge of the mass murders.
  I will never defend anyone who organizes or willingly participates in any war crime and I have a hard time defending anyone who claims they were an unwitting accomplice.  I do however believe that as a whole the German Army during this time period should be kept separate from the Holocaust of Bullets with the exception of specific cases that the Wehrmacht was involved.  There were many Wehrmacht units and some SS units for that matter that had no participation in the massacres in the east.
  On a final note I do believe this documentary sheds light on a clouded issue of the involvement of the Wehrmacht in these atrocities that has become a subject of silence.  I would like better research done and specific units singled out for their involvement rather than just throwing the entire Wehrmacht into participation.  And don't tell me that there aren't any records to substantiate because it has been seventy years.  The SS were proud of what they were doing and were thorough with their records so later generations could see what they accomplished.",1416528000,3,5626,4.535714285714286

The written works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who was a captain of artillery in the Soviet Red Army, tell a starkly different story.

It is also well-documented by both official and unofficial sources that Jews are the worst mass-murderers in all of recorded history. Exactly who but Jews do you think comprised not only the leadership but most of the rank and file membership of the murderous Soviet secret police?

Perhaps one could tell readers here who was ""the bloody dwarf."" And exactly who was it playing the major role in the Ukraine Holodomor that killed millions of white Christians, mostly by starving them to death? He was a Jew: Lazar Kaganovich.

And who were the Irgun terrorists, the ones who, for example, killed all those British soldiers in the King David Hotel? How many mass murders did they commit? Weren't they Jews? Jews like Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin? Sure they were.

And what of the outfit in the U.S. known as Murder Incorporated? Wasn't that a predominantly Jewish gang: Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Mendy Weiss, Abe Levine, Albert Tannenbaum, Lepke Buchalter, Sholem Bernstein?

What of the Sassoon Jews and the opium trade? Well, ... probably best to ask the Chinese about that one. And how many were killed in the South African Transvaal so the Jewish De Beers and Rothschilds could have the gold and diamonds?

The Jew Henry Morgenthau desired to kill, by starvation and pestilence, another 10 million German men, women and children immediately after WW II. The German Jew emigre Frederick Lindemann was the planner and major advocate of the fire-bombing of German civilians. You know, Wolfgang, like all the refugees, women and children, and wounded, who were burned alive in the napalm and white phosphorus hell-fire of Dresden on Valentine's Day 1945. The Oxford Chabad Society says that's their Jew Lindemann, alright.

Oh! and how about the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago, 1929, by the Purple Gang? What was The Purple Gang? Wasn't The Purple Gang comprised of mainly Jewish gangsters? Sure it was.

Who was it murdered those pretty Romanov girls? You know, the four sisters. Weren't they Jews who murdered them? And what business did those Jews have in Russia, anyway? Wasn't it also a Jew who assassinated Pyotr Stolypin? A Jew threw the bomb that killed Alexander II, the Tsar who freed the serfs. Right? Didn't Jews murder practically anyone reforming Russia for the better?

Weren't they Jews who instigated and led the communist revolt in Germany after World War I? Jews like Eisner, Levine, Liebknecht and Luxemburg? Do you think Germans knew about the butchery being committed by communists in Russia? I bet they did.

Who did the late Nobel Prize winner A. Solzhenitsyn say ran the Soviet gulags? Jews. Right? Yes, of course.

How many people were killed and died in those Soviet gulags? The arithmetic is widely available by Internet search. Solzhenitsyn sourced his numbers from an acquaintance in the Soviet Ministry of Statistics. (Remember, Solzhenitsyn was once an army officer.) Sixty-six million! 66 million mostly white Christians died in the gulags. How many were murdered in the name of the devilish Jewish Marxist ideology called communism? How many did communist Mao Zedong kill? How about the communist Pol Pot in Cambodia's ""Killing Fields.""

Are you following me here?  Do you get my drift?

Why were there so many volunteers from other European countries fighting on Germany's side during WW II? In fact, one of the units fighting to the last in Berlin in April 1945 was Norwegian and French! Men from Holland, France, Denmark, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Sweden, Norway -- all fought with Germany to defeat communism! That's what National Socialist Germany wanted. And, based on the bolshevik atrocities in Russia, what sane person could blame them? But, the communist-infested Britain and USA rescued their Soviet ally.

Who murdered the 4,500 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest? Was it the Soviet secret police: the predominantly Jewish Cheka?  The Russian Federation has recently admitted that it certainly was.

Do you believe Irene Zisblatt defecated diamonds repeatedly in the Nazi work camps?  She says she did.  Steven Spielberg says she did. And how could it be that forensics people discovered not long ago that Anne Frank's diary was written with ball-point pen? Did they have ball-point pens back then? I don't think they did.

Does it really make sense that a country of 80 million people and short on raw materials, locked in mortal combat with the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union - all at the same time - would be murdering a majority of their best workers?

What about the Jews who claim the Germans had dogs with poison teeth? Wouldn't that kill the dog? What about the Jewish girl who avoided the Germans, living for years with wolves in the Romanian forests? Yeah, I know, she did finally admit to being untruthful. Ha-ha-ha.

Who's responsible for the death and devastation in the recent Iraq War. Are they not also Jews? Sure they are. Just go to Google, type in 'pnac jews' and see the results. How many innocents have suffered and perished in Iraq?

Jewry is a global criminal syndicate. It always has been. It deals in everything from espionage and murder-for-hire to financial fraud, narcotics trafficking and prostitution. And the Holocaust is nothing but a Jewish extortion racket.

Who are the main players in the 2014 conflict in Ukraine? Poroshenko is a Jew. Yatsenyuk is a Jew. Voladymyr Groysman is a Jew. Yulia Tymoshenko is a Jew. Klitschko is a Jew. Kolomoisky is a Jew. The American and British instigators of the Kiev junta are all Jews: Victoria Nuland, David Cameron, Ed Miliband, George Soros.",1408924800,9,5822,5.008290155440415

To both of them I say, ""No, we'll think you're criminals if you continue to deny that common soldiers and people let their 'neighbors' and 'friends' be carted away like cattle and then brutally murdered, sometimes right in front of them, and then try to blame it all on a single political party. It's just as bad as the Japanese denying what happened in Nanking or the Turks denying the Armenian genocide.

I am an Army veteran who spent time in Germany and I am also a serious collector of vintage wworld war 2 medals and my collection is vast containing very rare decorations from the Germans and Russians. Veterans of the Army who I spoke to back in 1993 when I was in Germany told me of the killings that men in their unit took part in. They also showed me black and white photo's of Army troops executing civilians and also posing with the bodies. They sometimes also assisted the S.S. in getting Jews or slave laborers on the trains. The subject was very hush hush when I was in Germany but it has since come to light. There were too many soldiers from too many units who got involved. I became friends with a former member of the S.S, mountain infantry regiment Nord who fought the Russians near the artic circle. Read the book Black Edelweiss by former S.S. Nord mountain trooper who speaks about both combat and conscience and that even though they had fierce fights with the Russians in northern Karelia and the Vosges Mountains, he never witnessed one instance of atrocity between the German and the Russians, I am well versed in the S.S. units and Nord has not be put in the category such as Das Reich or totenkof. It's time for people to accept the truths that the Army was also responsible for killings. I make a point to acknowledge the soldier who fought hard for his comrades even when he knew the war was lost, but was no a part of any atrocities.

3056051,4,B0010YSDB8,"First,
  This is a well-done documentary on the subject of the German Army and its participation in the Nazi genocidal project.  Focusing on the 1995 Wehrmacht exhibition which first brought the crimes to public attention, it is an important introduction for those interested in the deep complicity of the Third Reich.

I must disagree with the top-rated reviewer.  From a scholarly perspective, there is little doubt that the Wehrmacht was involved, AS AN ORGANIZATION in the Holocaust.  MJG in his/her review simply focuses on a small attribution error in the exhibit that misidentified one Ukrainian perpetrator as a German soldier.  The documentary does NOT focus on ""isolated cases"" nor should the crimes of the Wehrmacht be categorized as such.

Dear Amazon reader,
  Beware many of the reviews here seem to be apologetic or unwilling to see the larger point which is that the German Army as an organization was a willing player in the crimes of the Third Reich.",1342224000,44,968,5.031446540880503
3056052,3,B0010YSDB8,"I noticed quite a contradiction during the first 5 minutes of this documentary.
One older German who got interviewed claims that the Wehrmacht had no idea what was going on in the concentration camps in 1943 when they had to move east as there were no more Jewish people left at that point (?).

How comes that in 1945 when the allied forces liberated the concentration camps there were still lots of Jewish survivors as we all know from short films like ""Death Mills""
made in Buchenwald which is also shown in the movie ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" and which allied forces camera men filmed while liberating Buchenwald in the spring of 1945?

So it seems rather weird to me if on the one hand Wehrmacht soldiers supposedly had no clue what was going on and on the other hand allied forces did liberate people in those camps.
BTW Russian troops liberated Auschwitz in late January 1945, so it was still existing when Wehrmacht troops had to move east to Stalingrad in August of 1942.",1313798400,,978,4.614942528735632
3290331,1,B0010YSDB8,"This was a documentary about an exhibition that made it seem that the entire German army in WWII, without any exceptions, were guilty of war crimes and the reactions to the exhibition. It was very much in favor of the documentary and against any one who complained about it. As for me . . . Give it a rest already! Like the German old man said, How many times do we have to rehash and re-rehash the same old tripe? Do other countries do it? Do the French? The Russians? The Israelis? <snicker>

German leftists may enjoy rubbing their countrymen's noses in the feces (while simultaneously ignoring or excusing the crimes of the Communists in East Germany) but I don't see the point, especially when it's been done so many times by so many people. Enough is enough. The problem is that they are on autopilot; after all these years, it really hasn't sunk in that the Soviet Empire is through, so there is no need to continue being anti-patriotic.

Incidentally, I read somewhere that the exhibition depicted in the movie was called off after it was found that some of the pictures taken of atrocities were not by the German army but the Soviet army. <snicker>",1311724800,12,1157,4.584541062801932
3290332,5,B0010YSDB8,"As a student of the German side re WWII for over 10 years, If there is one issue that just hits me like a sucker punch, it's the continuing ridiculous notion that the Wehrmacht was a simple bystander to the ""solution to the Jewish problem"". (Now known as the Holocaust) Almost everyone, officer or above on the eastern front, knew what was happening and the others heard of at least rumors.

While Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich were cunningly secretive about the genocide- they could not (nor could the SS) carry out such killings without the participation of the military. While I understand these older men not wanting to burden their families with such details, I hope the now elderly Wehrmacht soldiers don't expect everyone to be so nave.

The SS was the primary organization yes, but supporting roles were needed and filled by numerous organizations including the Wehrmacht and Todt Org.  I hope these men come to a point that they can be proud of their legitimate military accomplishments, while standing up to and taking responsibility for their moral failures.

This DVD itself, while not perfect, does a good job at raising the main issue. Why highly intelligent, motivated, ambitious, polite, good humored men- willingly followed the command of total paranoid psychopaths?  Commands written and verbal to murder, kidnap women and children, and to destroy the evidence. (Commands all semantically vague, manly, and heroic- of course) And why did they try to lie about it, knowing there are thousands of witnesses?

The Wehrmacht veterans I'm sure would love to take the accolades for victories, while pinning the moral failings and military disasters on Hitler /the SS. As with nearly everything related to this war, it is not that simple. They are only delaying the healing process of themselves, the victims, and generations of Germans that come after them.",1286150400,14,1869,5.0519480519480515
3290333,5,B0010YSDB8,"This documentary, designed for modern German and Austrian audiences, is startling, and for Germans born in the 1950s and 1960s it damns the older members of their families with a universal war guilt sometimes far beyond anything they can imagine. For some Germans, it is indeed cathartic to air the dirty laundry of the past; for others it's absolutely necessary, and for a third group, it can be a tragically horrid experience. This documentary rocked Germany's socks. I was a Fulbright Professor of History and American Studies at the University of Muenster in 1995, just when the Hamburg Exposition exploded on the scene. It did much harm as it did much good. Some old Wehrmacht soldiers, once proud of their wartime service, could hardly look their families in the eye. In a higher view of World War II, it does tell an essential and sad truth: that the wanton destruction of innocents including the premeditated wiping out of an entire people throughout Europe cannot be forgiven easily regardless of how much time has passed since 1945.",1224201600,20,1042,4.926136363636363
3290334,5,B0010YSDB8,"Until the full extent of German complicity--civilians and soldiers included--in the atrocities of WWII are revealed this nation will never be free from the considerable shame wrought by this time period.  We should keep in mind too, though, that there were German resistance fighters and that most attempts on Adolf Hitler's life were committed by German citizens/military.

""The Unknown Soldier"" is a particularly disheartening documentary on the 1995 Wehrmacht exhibition that took place in Vienna (and opens periodically every year those who care to take a look) which reveals pretty clearly that all members of the German army were either aware of or took part in the atrocities and mass shootings of civilians usually relegated to the SS or the Gestapo.

The obvious place of the Holocaust in the German psyche is shown very clearly as people outside the exhibition shove each other around, scream, and passionately debate about the accuracy or non-accuracy of the material presented in the exhibition. At one point a group of nearly toothless skinheads and right wing nutcases show up flying the Iron Cross and insisting that the whole thing is nonsense and that ""the press lies"".

Not so, it seems.  Four German historians, sensitive to the subject matter, uncover photographs of ordinary German soldiers standing next to executed jews (one photograph of a three year old jewish girl hanging is vomit worthy) and make it fairly clear that all German soldiers, Wehrmacht included, were given explicit instructions that they carried around on the Eastern front to shoot any of the ""rabble"" they encountered.  An aging member of the Wehrmacht admits very frankly that Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" captivated him for a time, and that he witnessed more than a few atrocities committed by the army. He also says very clearly that is ashamed of what he did and witnessed, and seems sincere.
What has long been suppressed is that German soldiers *were not* executed for refusing to participate in these atrocities; they were disciplined or were asked to work in different capacities.  This has long been known by historians but has never been given as explicit treatment as in this documentary.  And some Germans did just that; dropped out of the army entirely once that they saw what was going on.

This is not about all Germans being monsters.  Very soon this entire generation will die off and I think Germany should be commended for being so conscientious of these things, unlike some other nations who did very similar things and have never apologized once.  This is depressing and I would not watch it again, but is very important.  Recommended to any student of history.",1224115200,18,2669,5.040909090909091
3290335,3,B0010YSDB8,"Please read the product description and then read this, as I won't repeat the basic premise of the film. As someone with ties to Bavaria and a general interest in World War Two, this one jumped out at me from the library shelf. It seeks to address the culpability of the average German foot soldier regarding the war crimes that have made the War a low point in the annals of history. After watching it, however, I am left feeling a little less than ambivalent over it, thinking that it doesn't do justice to two aspects that is should have addressed.

First, the complicated thing we all possess called human nature, if there is even a human nature that we share, has obeyed more commands to do evil out of a herd instinct to obey than it has out of anger, religion or anything else. That is something that has been demonstrated time and again, famously by Milgrim in his shock study and Zimbardo in the Stanford Prison study, among many others. Humans will do almost anything to conform to herd expectations or the expectations of authority figures, even the greatest evils. This is a point that the director should have made strongly, showing it is not something unique to a certain type of German person to do wrong. It is universal. You and I would most likely not be the heroic resister, but the acquiescing accomplice. Face it; statistically it is true. Had that point been made, and it could have been, then we could have moved beyond the emotionalism of both sides that is a main feature of the film.

Second, while I have absolutely no sympathy for those who committed such atrocities, it is simply ridiculous, and offensive, to paint with such a large brush so as to implicate all of the German soldiers. Why end there? Why not all the German people?  Again, the evils done by such a large amount of Germans, and German soldiers in particular, must never be forgotten. However, assigning blame in such a swath is irresponsible, especially given the nature of the topic.

So in the end I feel that the exhibition is important and needed, but how you handle the documents, photos, testimonies needs to be more nuanced to be accurate and responsible. Give it a viewing and leave your own thoughts.",1218499200,8,2205,4.61734693877551
3290336,2,B0010YSDB8,"The subject of this documentary is the opening of the Wehrmachtaustellung (Wehrmacht Exhibition) in 1995, the now famous collection of photographs and documents that provided graphic evidence of German atrocities throughout the Second World War. What distinguished the exhibition from past scholarship on the 3rd Reich, was its depiction of the German Army, or Wehrmacht, as one of the main perpetrators of .the Holocaust - essentially no different from the SS, SD, or other Nazi organizations commonly associated with the brutality and mass murder of Hitler's regime. Although a full rehash of the Wehrmacht Exhibit isn't appropriate here, in short, the controversy that persists to this day is whether the photographs show individual acts of barbarism committed by German troops or, as the Exhibit maintains, irrefutable evidence of the German Army's complicity in Nazi crimes. In other words, are these photos proof that ordinary, rank-and-file German soldiers willingly, even enthusiastically, participated in mass murder? Or are these merely isolated cases that should not (or cannot) be distorted to represent the behavior of the over eleven million men who passed through the army's ranks?

Now to the documentary:

Scope: The film purports to provide an objective, balanced account of the Wehrmacht Exhibition, in particular the controversies over the exhibition itself, the public attention it aroused throughout Germany, and the circumstances of its premature closing due to inaccuracies among its photographs. In addition, the documentary attempts to further investigate the complicity of the Wehrmacht in Hitler's crimes and refute the notion that German Army had been a mere spectator, or pawn, during the Holocaust. To accomplish this, commentary from leading scholars, former Wehrmacht members, and Holocaust survivors would provide critique and broach a discussion on the merits and shortcomings of the exhibition.

Focus: From the outset, the film veers off topic from the original opening of exhibition and a discussion German atrocities and digresses to crimes committed by the SS, the first use of gas vans at concentration camps, and Auschwitz. Roughly 1/3 of the film consists of tangents on the mass murder of the Jews and the 3rd Reich's genocidal policies in the USSR and Eastern Europe. This desultory format is annoying at best - one has a hard time keeping track of the producer's arguments as the interviews and footage appear cobbled together with little forethought.  Moreover, no new material is introduced about Wehrmacht atrocities during WWII.

Objectivity: This is by far the biggest disappointment.  My hope was to see an unbiased, objective analysis of the Wehrmacht Exhibition and the subject of German war crimes under Hitler. I was looking forward to hearing feedback from historians and scholars advocating different viewpoints and walk away with new insights or at least a better understanding of the controversies this exhibit evoked. Instead, it was immediately clear which side the documentary took: while there was indeed a panel of respected history professors, authors, and politicians present throughout the film, without exception they were either directly affiliated with the exhibition itself or proponents of its overall message (I gave 2 stars because many of their arguments were compelling). Yet for counterarguments and critique against the exhibition, the film relies  exclusively on soundbytes and interviews from right-wing (neo-nazi) politicians, angry, shouting skinheads, and a handful of disgruntled veterans. One gets the impression that those who disagree with the exhibition's thesis are either poorly educated or neo-fascist hooligans. Of the 10 or so professors and professional historians that appeared, not a single one offered any substantive critique, rather they lauded the exhibit or diminished those who disagreed with their views.  The controversy and questions over Wehrmacht involvement in war crimes continue to this day. There are numerous journal articles and books written that by distinguished historians in Germany and the U.S. in criticism of the exhibition, and new research continues to emerge.  As such, I expected a degree of critical dialogue and some back-and-forth debates. Very disappointing.

Conclusion: Ultimately - a letdown.  One-sided, entirely subjective portrayal of the exhibit and the Wehrmacht itself, ""The Unknown Soldier"" doesn't offer any fresh insights or new arguments.  Unfortunately, it's the only English language documentary on this topic to date.",1207526400,95,4562,5.595652173913043
3290337,1,B0010YSDB8,"The creators of The Unknown Soldier once again take it upon themselves to rehash information that has been well known since the Nuremberg trial's. In short there is nothing new about this documentary that you can't find by Goggling it, or accessing Wikiipedia . It is a well know historical fact that the so called ""solders"" that were sent to kill were mostly members of the Einsatz Grupen. A group of murderers brought together by general Erhard Galen. The same Erhard Galen who was brought over to the United States via Project Paper Clip. It was Galen who worked with the state department to develop a little idea known as the CIA. Back to the Einsatz Grupen. These men weren't fit for regular service, so they were sent in behind the real army as part of the ""final solution"". The same final solution formulated by members of the SS, to rape kill pillage, and otherwise mame. Along with the help of their Catholic capitulators' in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Ukraine, and Russia. Yes folks lets not forget they had eager co-conspirators in this little venture. So much work, so few hands. Is the Unknown Soldier an attempt to honestly come to grips with a sorted national past? Or is it just another way for spineless surrender monkeys to bend over for the victor nations once again? Victor nations who's own sorted pasts' are far from laudable if we were to make a documentary about them. From the trail of tears in America to the atrocities committed by the British colonial army. As an ardent viewer of documentaries, and reader of histories I'm fairly sickened by the Micheal Moors' out there who take it upon themselves to bring us
 ""new "" information about a well known subject to those who study it.

Their slaughter including non-combatants and prisoners of war.  it's focus is directed at the Army personnel, both Commander and Foot Soldier and their willingness to help perpetuate the massacres of millions of men,women and children either by execution or simply starvation. We do learn there were some Commander's who did not follow through with some of these atrocities  and we are told there were no reprisals for their non-action. I don't believe that is entirely truthful as I have read that by the end of WW II Hitler had replaced all but one of his original field commander Generals.

 In defense of the Army, there were many officers such as Hans Oster who were foundations in the German resistance which is  not evident at this exhibit.

These were popular and extremely controversial exhibitions in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  The title of the second exhibition, a toned-down version, was entitled ""Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944 (""Crimes of the Wehrmacht 1941 to 1944"").""  That should tell you it was not a balanced portrayal.  Far from it. Certainly, there were Wehrmacht solders who committed atrocities.  But there were many soldiers who refused to commit such atrocities, even when repeatedly, and heatedly, ordered to do so.  The film discusses ONE such soldier, Josef Sibille.  Others obeyed without hesitation. Others obeyed because they feared the consequences.  Others because Befehl ist Befehl.  (""An Order is an Order."")  The German word for criminal, Verbrecher, is the most commonly used word in the film.  Certainly, and undeniably, horrible atrocities were committed on the Eastern Front.  But care should be taken in evaluating the film's suggestions about who committed what.

One of the ""historians"" behind the exhibit appears often in the film.  He comes across as a reasonable person who has marshalled evidence.  If one does his research, one finds he is a political extremist who was banned from public employment in Germany.  Yet, the Hamburger Institut fr Sozialforschung thought he was a good candiate to prepare the exhibit.  There were problems from the beginning. For example, numerous photos of atrocities supposedly committed by the Wehrmacht were actually commited by the Red Army.  Montages of photos that had nothing to do with each other were juxtaposed to be misleading.  This film presents his analysis and statements without giving any of his background.

I give this film 3 stars because it contains photos and accounts that must be remembered.  It presents the public's reactions to the exhibits.  It is an intersting starting point for those who want to explore the subject, but by no means should one think this film presents a fair, balanced view.  In some ways, it is as misleading as the first Exhibition.",1454198400,,2224,5.273504273504273

I believe after watching this that it could have been the exception rather than the norm. Very well thought out reasoning of how they wore the citizens and common folk down to numb them to the purge of the jews, and opened my eyes to the scope of how they killed them. My understanding was that they mostly went to work camps and were gassed. Hardly the norm, in fact probably the most common way was to round them up, take them out of the town/city etc, march them to a big hole in the ground or some naturally formed site where they could make them strip, then shoot them in the neck, making them lay on top of the last person they just shot.

My impression regarding this controversy over the honoring of fallen German soldiers begs this question... Who in their right mind can justify the actions of Nazi Germany and feel good about their sacrifice?

Also, clearly evident Neo-Nazi movement is alive and well -- and that those who belong to that movement are not allowed to speak to media.

I think this was a decent film, and a real hard one as well. These are tough questions and their is some truth to both sides. It's easy to sit there and say everyone in the German army were all war criminals. Even if you do, it is still a hard thing to stomach either way and tension would be high on the stomach. Time doesn't heal all wounds and you do have to remember that the Germans lost a whole generation in the war and to starvation at the end of the war and had no break right on into the cold war. I'm not crying tears for them, they reaped what they sowed but you also have to remember the Nazi's and the Russians were the same homicidal monster and by the end most German's in the army were fighting not for Hitler, but for existance. A touch  subject for sure, but even with the above mentioned considerations, the difference is that the German's started it, and chose their path at that time. My applause though goes to keeping the memory alive because most of the world is trying to forget and the proof is in the pudding now with Russia's annexation of the Crimea and that black hole of death in the Deserts of Iraq and Syria. It is in Africa from Libya to Somalia and across the Red Sea to Yemen. It is in the Chinese Naval build up and lurking tensions with Japan.

It develops the idea that the average German soldier (not just the SS) participated in Hitler's attempt to exterminate of Jews.  It shatters the long and dearly-held myth among the German people that if your father, grandfather or perhaps even great grandfather was not SS, they knew next to nothing about it.  The footage is compelling, convincing, horrifying and truly heart-wrenching.  It needs to be seen.

It was not without hope.  There were a few Commanders (far too few) who categorically refused to go into towns and shoot every Jewish woman and child.  There were people who attempted to protest.  Few of these brave people survived.  But they should always be remembered.

Both really did not talk about witnessing those fatal tertiary civilian experiences they during 1939 to 1945, and no family member wanted asked about it and thus hoping to forget about it. Younger generations of Germans offer a variety opinions to the blame of the genocide era as they cannot ask the elders who were alive during this period what were the rammifications or reasons for such a disasterous state sponsorship of murder. Yet for that time period in the 1930's the German people elected a dictator from Austria, who in turn had the generals and soldiers of the army swear allegiance to him or suffer personal consequences. The army was now the strongest political arm and society adhered to it as it was considered normal to belong to the select choice of society, and not be singled out as an hated outcast. The Germany army as well as the general public did indeed participate in the genocide with direct or indirect involvement. Holocaust trains were given priority on all rail lines especially in the east to Wehrmacht trains much to the disdain of generals commanders. Wehrmacht trains sometimes sat for days in stations at rail sidings waiting for the trains to carry their victims to the camps to go by.

Even in history monarchies and democracies there similar issues of blame of similar genocide where their armies followed orders from the political supreme on direct orders to quell the people, and so the armies dealt with civil rule, eliminating cultural strife, and resettlements of state undesirables. Could it be worthy to say the US Army is solely responsible for any deaths of civilians being confined in the Japanese internment camps during World War II after watching this movie? The scope of American internment camps is not as large as what nazi Germany is responsible, yet expected mortality was not normal for people living behind confinement.

It should be called: ""Simple German soldiers still shamelessly deny their complicity in WW2 atrocities.''

What is marvelous about (many) Germans today is the continued open discussion that allowed for a significant section of society to have self introspection. That makes those that accepted responsibility maybe the best humans on earth.

At the same time those that didn't are among the worst. There are quite a few of them in the movie.

As someone whose ancestry is 1/2 German-Jews and 1/4 holocaust survivors, nothing was new to me. My Jewish great-grandfather was a German hero of WWI and a city-council member in Nuremberg  - that left after Kristalnacht. From him and my grandmother I knew about the two-faced attitude of the Germans under Hitler. These were `his friends' until they almost killed him. From the other side of the family I knew about the enthusiasm with which all German soldiers moved to kill Slavs and Jews. They all facilitated the deportation trains, death marches, `partisan' annihilation. All of them. That was what every soldier knew the purpose of the war to be!

From 1945 and until reunification in 1990 NATO allowed this idiotic lie that ""regular Germans"" didn't know what the NAZIs and SS were doing. This was allowed so that Germans may help fight the Soviet union.  After 45 years of lying it is hard to admit that you were lying for so long.",1417910400,4,1434,4.828571428571428

3290532,4,B0010YSDB8,"I will first begin by saying that I am a combat veteran from the U.S. Marine Corps so I believe that I can speak with some degree of experience of the impact on men in combat.  I think they're are some real misinterpretations here.  I have read several of the reviews and I agree entirely with some and disagree adamantly with others.  Now I do think that the atrocities committed by the Germans in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia are an unprecedented brand of evil that we have never seen before in humankind, I reserve judgement to some extent to the basic fighting man.  I have been that basic fighting man so I feel I stand on some sort of common ground with them everywhere.  I do believe the SS, SD and Gestapo should forever be held accountable for their crimes so that this history can never be repeated.  I served in a conflict in which American war crimes have taken place against in a manner that should never take place.  But I also believe it's a major injustice to the whole of a fighting force for the actions of a few.  Now granted, the few in the Wehrmacht that participated in the Holocaust of Bullets is a larger number than the few in any other instance in history.  However their are millions of good fighting men that served in the German army that are not tainted by this history.  Most of these men that we are talking about are in fact just young boys trying to do a good job and defend their homeland from lies that had been pounded into their heads since they were children.  With that being said I think it is unfair to say that the entire German army during this time period were a bunch of blood crazed murderers.
  The mission of the genocide fell entirely on the shoulders of the SS.  The documents that Reinhard Heydrich wrote have proven that.  Now some of these mass murders were so large in scale that the SS couldn't handle the job so Wehrmacht soldiers were taken to accomplish these massacres.  There are further documents from HItler's lackey Field Marshall Wilhelm Keitel that the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front were to assist the SS and Einsatzguppen in any capacity the SS saw fit.
  You can ask any basic German civilian or soldier during that time frame that the SS were a terrifying collection of people.  It was well known that when the SS showed up on your doorstep in Berlin or on the Eastern Front that you cooperated in every manner possible or you would be dealt with appropriately, according to the old Nazi line.  So when the SS showed up at your unit and says, ""We need fifty men to carry out an operation.""  Every commanding officer in the Wehrmacht jumped and provided what was needed.  May I also add that on many occasions when the SS came to get their water carriers from the Wehrmacht they told them that they were going to be testing new weapons systems.  What 19 year old kid isn't going to jump at the chance to go test some sort of new military technology.  That's one of the best parts of being in the military.  Now the SS has their men and they take them to some remote forest where trenches have been dug and hundreds, if not thousands of people are standing around in groups.  The SS now informs you of your mission.  You have a serious doubts, not only to legality but the humanity of this order.  You then look around and see dozens of menacing, black clad SS officers standing around with rifles and machine guns.  What do you do now?
  It may be somewhat easy at our distant remove, and security of not being in the actual situation, to say that I would disobey this order and take whatever punishment may come.  It could quite easily prove that you would end up in the trench as well.  After all, the SS can't allow a non-cooperative dissenter to go back and tell the story when he didn't participate.  Now I know what most of you are thinking if you've indulged me thus far, participation through fear does not absolve you of the crime.  And I also know that some members of the Wehrmacht willingly and enthusiastically participated.  Does this justify the labeling of millions of others who did not participate as criminals.  Then it must be said that the American army is an army of thugs for the atrocities they committed by executing prisoners during the Battle of the Bulge and their many transgressions committed by only few in Vietnam and the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts.  Writing that alone was an affront to my pride as an American servicemen much to what I imagine it would be to those men in the Wehrmacht who did not participate and had no knowledge of the mass murders.
  I will never defend anyone who organizes or willingly participates in any war crime and I have a hard time defending anyone who claims they were an unwitting accomplice.  I do however believe that as a whole the German Army during this time period should be kept separate from the Holocaust of Bullets with the exception of specific cases that the Wehrmacht was involved.  There were many Wehrmacht units and some SS units for that matter that had no participation in the massacres in the east.
  On a final note I do believe this documentary sheds light on a clouded issue of the involvement of the Wehrmacht in these atrocities that has become a subject of silence.  I would like better research done and specific units singled out for their involvement rather than just throwing the entire Wehrmacht into participation.  And don't tell me that there aren't any records to substantiate because it has been seventy years.

The written works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who was a captain of artillery in the Soviet Red Army, tell a starkly different story.

It is also well-documented by both official and unofficial sources that Jews are the worst mass-murderers in all of recorded history. Exactly who but Jews do you think comprised not only the leadership but most of the rank and file membership of the murderous Soviet secret police?

Perhaps one could tell readers here who was ""the bloody dwarf."" And exactly who was it playing the major role in the Ukraine Holodomor that killed millions of white Christians, mostly by starving them to death? He was a Jew: Lazar Kaganovich.

And who were the Irgun terrorists, the ones who, for example, killed all those British soldiers in the King David Hotel? How many mass murders did they commit? Weren't they Jews? Jews like Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin? Sure they were.

And what of the outfit in the U.S. known as Murder Incorporated? Wasn't that a predominantly Jewish gang: Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Mendy Weiss, Abe Levine, Albert Tannenbaum, Lepke Buchalter, Sholem Bernstein?

What of the Sassoon Jews and the opium trade? Well, ... probably best to ask the Chinese about that one. And how many were killed in the South African Transvaal so the Jewish De Beers and Rothschilds could have the gold and diamonds?

The Jew Henry Morgenthau desired to kill, by starvation and pestilence, another 10 million German men, women and children immediately after WW II. The German Jew emigre Frederick Lindemann was the planner and major advocate of the fire-bombing of German civilians. You know, Wolfgang, like all the refugees, women and children, and wounded, who were burned alive in the napalm and white phosphorus hell-fire of Dresden on Valentine's Day 1945. The Oxford Chabad Society says that's their Jew Lindemann, alright.

Oh! and how about the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago, 1929, by the Purple Gang? What was The Purple Gang? Wasn't The Purple Gang comprised of mainly Jewish gangsters? Sure it was.

Who was it murdered those pretty Romanov girls? You know, the four sisters. Weren't they Jews who murdered them? And what business did those Jews have in Russia, anyway? Wasn't it also a Jew who assassinated Pyotr Stolypin? A Jew threw the bomb that killed Alexander II, the Tsar who freed the serfs. Right? Didn't Jews murder practically anyone reforming Russia for the better?

Weren't they Jews who instigated and led the communist revolt in Germany after World War I? Jews like Eisner, Levine, Liebknecht and Luxemburg? Do you think Germans knew about the butchery being committed by communists in Russia? I bet they did.

Who did the late Nobel Prize winner A. Solzhenitsyn say ran the Soviet gulags? Jews. Right? Yes, of course.

How many people were killed and died in those Soviet gulags? The arithmetic is widely available by Internet search. Solzhenitsyn sourced his numbers from an acquaintance in the Soviet Ministry of Statistics. (Remember, Solzhenitsyn was once an army officer.) Sixty-six million! 66 million mostly white Christians died in the gulags. How many were murdered in the name of the devilish Jewish Marxist ideology called communism? How many did communist Mao Zedong kill? How about the communist Pol Pot in Cambodia's ""Killing Fields.""

Are you following me here?  Do you get my drift?

Why were there so many volunteers from other European countries fighting on Germany's side during WW II? In fact, one of the units fighting to the last in Berlin in April 1945 was Norwegian and French! Men from Holland, France, Denmark, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Sweden, Norway -- all fought with Germany to defeat communism! That's what National Socialist Germany wanted. And, based on the bolshevik atrocities in Russia, what sane person could blame them? But, the communist-infested Britain and USA rescued their Soviet ally.

Who murdered the 4,500 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest? Was it the Soviet secret police: the predominantly Jewish Cheka?  The Russian Federation has recently admitted that it certainly was.

Do you believe Irene Zisblatt defecated diamonds repeatedly in the Nazi work camps?  She says she did.  Steven Spielberg says she did. And how could it be that forensics people discovered not long ago that Anne Frank's diary was written with ball-point pen? Did they have ball-point pens back then? I don't think they did.

Does it really make sense that a country of 80 million people and short on raw materials, locked in mortal combat with the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union - all at the same time - would be murdering a majority of their best workers?

What about the Jews who claim the Germans had dogs with poison teeth? Wouldn't that kill the dog? What about the Jewish girl who avoided the Germans, living for years with wolves in the Romanian forests? Yeah, I know, she did finally admit to being untruthful. Ha-ha-ha.

Who's responsible for the death and devastation in the recent Iraq War. Are they not also Jews? Sure they are. Just go to Google, type in 'pnac jews' and see the results. How many innocents have suffered and perished in Iraq?

Jewry is a global criminal syndicate. It always has been. It deals in everything from espionage and murder-for-hire to financial fraud, narcotics trafficking and prostitution. And the Holocaust is nothing but a Jewish extortion racket.

Who are the main players in the 2014 conflict in Ukraine? Poroshenko is a Jew. Yatsenyuk is a Jew. Voladymyr Groysman is a Jew. Yulia Tymoshenko is a Jew. Klitschko is a Jew. Kolomoisky is a Jew. The American and British instigators of the Kiev junta are all Jews: Victoria Nuland, David Cameron, Ed Miliband, George Soros.",1408924800,9,5822,5.008290155440415
3290541,4,B0010YSDB8,"This is an exemplory film that shows a side of WWII that is not often discussed. In movies and films it is always the SS and members of the Third Reich who perpetrated the crimes against the jewish populations. When it was documented that the soldiers and civilians took place in it.

What angers me the most is the man near the beginning asking ""Why hash this all out 50 years later? Why bring it to light?"" and the other man who said ""It will make the whole world think we germans are criminals if you show this.""

To both of them I say, ""No, we'll think you're criminals if you continue to deny that common soldiers and people let their 'neighbors' and 'friends' be carted away like cattle and then brutally murdered, sometimes right in front of them, and then try to blame it all on a single political party. It's just as bad as the Japanese denying what happened in Nanking or the Turks denying the Armenian genocide. Denying that those events happened doesn't make it go away and it certainly doesn't make the world see you as innocent or uninvolved. It makes the world look at you with contempt for the fact that, with all the evidence, you still try to deny it."" That's my response.",1408752000,2,1190,4.429223744292237

3290543,3,B0010YSDB8,"The first review (by MJG) is excellent and well written . . . I have only one comment to add. The translation captions can be tedious for some and an understanding of the Germany language allows for the slight nuisances in translation. The accusations against the Wehrmacht are accurate and leave no room for denial . . . and still there are those that will deny! For those familiar with the topic, there is only a different point of view and perhaps a better understanding.

Definitely recommended for those with an interest in human behavior or the ideological factors that allowed for the Holocaust. When does political ideology become a licence for torture and murder? What influences the beginning of genocide?

3290546,5,B0010YSDB8,"I found this to be refreshing because over the years many speak as though it was only the S.S. einsatzgruppen who did the bulk of the atrocities. I am an Army veteran who spent time in Germany and I am also a serious collector of vintage wworld war 2 medals and my collection is vast containing very rare decorations from the Germans and Russians. Veterans of the Army who I spoke to back in 1993 when I was in Germany told me of the killings that men in their unit took part in. They also showed me black and white photo's of Army troops executing civilians and also posing with the bodies. They sometimes also assisted the S.S. in getting Jews or slave laborers on the trains. The subject was very hush hush when I was in Germany but it has since come to light. There were too many soldiers from too many units who got involved. I became friends with a former member of the S.S, mountain infantry regiment Nord who fought the Russians near the artic circle. Read the book Black Edelweiss by former S.S. Nord mountain trooper who speaks about both combat and conscience and that even though they had fierce fights with the Russians in northern Karelia and the Vosges Mountains, he never witnessed one instance of atrocity between the German and the Russians, I am well versed in the S.S. units and Nord has not be put in the category such as Das Reich or totenkof. It's time for people to accept the truths that the Army was also responsible for killings. I make a point to acknowledge the soldier who fought hard for his comrades even when he knew the war was lost, but was no a part of any atrocities. The subject matter is delicate but must be told.",1390780800,45,1653,4.405228758169935

Absolutely riveting. The Germans learned nothing from WWII.",1370476800,6,414,5.484375
3290548,4,B0010YSDB8,"First,
  This is a well-done documentary on the subject of the German Army and its participation in the Nazi genocidal project.  Focusing on the 1995 Wehrmacht exhibition which first brought the crimes to public attention, it is an important introduction for those interested in the deep complicity of the Third Reich.

I must disagree with the top-rated reviewer.  From a scholarly perspective, there is little doubt that the Wehrmacht was involved, AS AN ORGANIZATION in the Holocaust.  MJG in his/her review simply focuses on a small attribution error in the exhibit that misidentified one Ukrainian perpetrator as a German soldier.  The documentary does NOT focus on ""isolated cases"" nor should the crimes of the Wehrmacht be categorized as such.

Dear Amazon reader,
  Beware many of the reviews here seem to be apologetic or unwilling to see the larger point which is that the German Army as an organization was a willing player in the crimes of the Third Reich.",1342224000,44,968,5.031446540880503
3290549,3,B0010YSDB8,"I noticed quite a contradiction during the first 5 minutes of this documentary.
One older German who got interviewed claims that the Wehrmacht had no idea what was going on in the concentration camps in 1943 when they had to move east as there were no more Jewish people left at that point (?).

How comes that in 1945 when the allied forces liberated the concentration camps there were still lots of Jewish survivors as we all know from short films like ""Death Mills""
made in Buchenwald which is also shown in the movie ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" and which allied forces camera men filmed while liberating Buchenwald in the spring of 1945?

So it seems rather weird to me if on the one hand Wehrmacht soldiers supposedly had no clue what was going on and on the other hand allied forces did liberate people in those camps.
BTW Russian troops liberated Auschwitz in late January 1945, so it was still existing when Wehrmacht troops had to move east to Stalingrad in August of 1942.",1313798400,,978,4.614942528735632

8239517,3,B0010YSDB8,This was a review of the role the average German soldier played in the holocaust. It also shows us how many still deny that the role was at times pure evil or immoral. It contains many scenes from the war to refute the view the German soldier was innocent. Somewhat interesting and it did hold my attention but it was often focused on the present day refusal to admit guilt then on the events themselves.
