453033,3,6302320763,"This is a moderately entertaining late work from John Frankenheimer. The basic premise - a young journalist writes a novel about the Red Brigade in 1970's Italy, only to have it stolen and mistaken for the truth, causing him and his friends to be hunted for murder - is strong. The film itself is hampered by an obviously low budget and a lackluster leading man, though Stone and Golino are quite good. Even with schlocky stuff like this, Frankenheimer's talent with the camera and his actors shines through.

The DVD, however, is a complete disaster. Many scenes are in Italian, but Sony has left off the original subtitles, as another reviewer mentioned. Scenes going on for five minutes at a stretch become incomprehensible. In addition, though the case says the film is in 1.66:1 widescreen, it is actually fullscreen.

The film is not a masterpiece by any means, but it deserved better treatment than this.",1171324800,7,911,4.870967741935484
453034,3,6302320763,"This is one of those occasions where the film beats the book.
The greatest enemy of this movie has nothing to do with the film.  It has to do with the fact that how many viewers will care enough about Italy and its communist 70's problems.
Dialogue is dialogue unless its written by Ed Wood.  The twists in the plot are enough to keep  you watching.  And you may even be surprised.
Polical films require the viewer to accept some amazing coincidences, the kind of coincidences that occurred in ""The Day of the Jacket,"" which is referred to in this film also.
The film didn't and wouldn't win an award, and who cares who the director is.  The novel was thin also, but again, there is no international intrigue, just an American caught in a duplicious situation.",1078185600,,760,4.518248175182482
453035,3,6302320763,"I rented this movie merely because I was in the mood for an action movie.  ""Year Of The Gun"" is one of the more passable films that Frankenheimer has made in recent years.
In 1978, Italy is politically divided over the terrorist group The Red Brigades.  An American journalist(Andrew McCarthy) is writing a fictional novel about The Red Brigades and the storyline coincidentally presages the actual terrorist plans of the group.  The Brigades steal a manuscript of the novel and consider McCarthy to be a threat.  As a result, McCarthy is on the run for his own life.
""Year Of The Gun"" is a modest and unmemorable but decent Frankenheimer thriller.  The acting is mostly wooden and the story has some logic problems.  The film also features a very poorly executed bank robbery-sequence.  As a Frankenheimer picture, ""YOTG"" doesn't come close to matching such great films as ""Seven Days In May,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" and ""Black Sunday.""  Nevertheless, ""YOTG"" actually manages to be one of the more decent thrillers that Frankenheimer has made in recent years.  ""YOTG"" is only slightly inferior to ""Ronin.""  The movie generates a reasonable amount of suspense.  The picture also has none of the blatant ludicrousness that has plagued many of Frankenheimer's post-1960s films.
""YOTG"" is a forgettable but decent time killer.",1005696000,,1328,5.101851851851852
453036,1,6302320763,"What a shame that such an interesting idea for a story was botched so, so badly.  The acting and dialogue are damnable, and certain segments are pretentious in the extreme.  Thankfully most of the movie is bad in a very  conventional way.
This is one film that I hope gets remade someday with  more competence.  Frankenheimer is usually reliable, but goodness me, this  movie fails with a vengeance.",943747200,6,399,4.794117647058823

7824334,3,6302320763,"Italy 1978: American journalist David Raybourne (Andrew McCarthy) moves to Italy with the intention of writing a political thriller about the Red Brigade, a group of left-wing radicals who were terrorizing Italy at the time. Photojournalist Alison King (Sharon Stone), who also wants to produce a book on the Red Brigade, albeit a non-fiction one, accidentally mistakes Raybourne's novel for a work of fact and ultimately causes the Red Brigade to believe that their deepest secrets are about to be exposed, leading to Raybourne and King being forced to flee for their lives.

""The Year of the Gun"" is a reasonably entertaining political thriller/action film that is hampered by its desire to integrate historical facts into its storyline. Being neither Italian nor alive in the 1970's, I was unfamiliar with the historical background to ""The Year of the Gun"" prior to sitting down to watch it. This made the first half hour or so of this film a little bit difficult for me to follow, but once I started to catch on to what was going on, I quite enjoyed this film and found myself comparing it favourably to other political thrillers that I had seen, such as ""The Manchurian Candidate"", which was also directed by John Frankenheimer, the director of this film. Unfortunately, in the end, ""The Year of the Gun"" is no ""Manchurian Candidate"".

""The Year of the Gun"" falls down by wanting to include the kidnapping of president Aldo Moro into its plot. It is a historical fact that Aldo Moro was kidnapped and ultimately murdered by the Red Brigade, something which the writers of this film couldn't change. Although a kidnapping makes for exciting viewing, the facts rule out Moro being saved by our heroes, making for a rather disappointing ending to this film. Another drawback is that throughout this film there are numerous scenes where characters converse in Italian with no subtitles, with these scenes becoming longer and more frequent as the film progresses. I can assure you that even two minutes of hearing people speak in a language that you can't understand is enough to make you lose interest in what you are watching. This is a well made film and everyone involved in it seems to be trying very hard to make it work (and both Stone and McCarthy turn in good performances), but in the end, the short comings make this a film that I will probably never revisit, rather than a classic like ""The Manchurian Candidate"".",1227052800,,2425,4.840963855421687
7824335,4,6302320763,"The latter years of John Frankenheimer's career were mostly a downward spiral with only occasional rare steps in the right direction, but Year of the Gun is certainly one of his better late entries thanks to a terrific premise. A less annoying than usual Andrew McCarthy is an American writer in Rome secretly working on a Day of the Jackal-style novel about a Red Brigade plot to kidnap Aldo Moro, only to end up in their bad books in a very big way when it turns out to be a virtual blueprint for the real-life crime they're on the verge of committing. Sharon Stone, in the best of her pre-Basic Instinct films, plays the pushy freelance photo-journalist after his story who gets down to her trademark horizontal gymnastics (sans icepick this time) for good measure, while no-one else is what they seem to be.

The plot creates its own momentum, leaving Frankenheimer free to evoke the chaotic Italian political landscape and the shocking violence of the Red Brigade's outrages in a series of convincing set-pieces. The action is well-handled - especially a bank getaway and a prolonged chase sequence - the story engrossing and for once the ending catches you off-guard. Not up to the standard of Frankenheimer's earlier classics, this is still a superior thriller, though the lack of English subtitles for the Italian dialogue is a bit frustrating - they're not to be found on the UK DVD or the widescreen German DVD (which cuts one sex scene from the US and UK versions but includes it as a deleted scene) either.",1203033600,4,1518,4.75
