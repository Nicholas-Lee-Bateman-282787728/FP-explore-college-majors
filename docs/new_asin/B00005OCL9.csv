7948664,4,B00005OCL9,"This is the third and last installment in the 'Monster Mania' series documentaries. I really liked this volume as it centered on giant monsters in the movies. There is lots of Ray Harryhausen monsters, Godzilla, 50's giant bugs, so the program is full of great footage and trivia for the monster kid in all of us. Introduction and closing by Elvira is always a treat and Bill Mumy(Lost In Space)does the narration. With a running time of only 55 minutes this and the other two volumes in the series could have fit on one DVD to save fans money and space. Greed is a terrible thing and this is why I rated it four stars instead of five.",1205712000,7,635,4.389830508474576
7948665,5,B00005OCL9,"No stone was unturned when this document was made. This monster
mash originally aired on AMC's ""monsterfest"" a few years ago and
hosted by ""Lost in space"" television star Billy Mumy
  This near hour long program covers all aspects of the big beast
on the movie and TV screen as well as Myth and folklore. From thier
primevil beginnings of George Miele's Trip to the moon & Lost world
to such recent nightmares as Starship troopers & Mighty Joe young.
  In between, movie historians,technicians and seasoned authors give their ""matter of fact"" views on how the giant monster films
have not only progressed thru out the years but also we the film
goers have changed from the coming of world war II thru the drive
in craze, the television invasion and so fourth. Everytime I get
to watch this disc I end up watching""Attack of the crab monsters""
or""Earth vs. the spider"" right after. Peppered with endless clips
this dvd is a must for any true giant monster movie collector.",1079049600,5,970,4.688235294117647
