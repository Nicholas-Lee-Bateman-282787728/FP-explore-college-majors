1690788,4,B000063K1C,"This is a genuinely heartwarming story. As a Southerner, I can vouch for its authenticity, its ""realness.""  The portrayals of the central characters, especially Tiger, are true and done with love.

This is a great story for the young.  It's equally great for those who aren't so young, but remember.",1156550400,8,299,4.94
1690789,5,B000063K1C,"This movie is wonderful.  If you love Anne of Green Gables, this is the movie for you.  Growing up with a disabled mother myself, I completely realated to the young girl.  I couldn't stop crying all the way through.  The ending left me wanting more.  We just got a brief snipit of the lives of the characters.  I would definitely welcome a sequel.  It is just a heart-warming movie that I think all would enjoy.  Oh and by the way, you don't have to be a southern to appreciate it.",1147564800,8,481,4.266666666666667
1690790,5,B000063K1C,"I Love this movie and ordered a gift copy to my sister who still lives in a small Louisiana town. You probably have to be a Southernor to appreciate all the nuances in this movie.  For instance, no one actually refers to Aunt Dora as a prostitute, but it is alluded to in text and body language, the Southern way.  To be fully aware, keep on your toes and observe to catch all the implications.  Remember, most folks did not have a big income, a car, and they were not merchandise junkies, yet.  I lived during this time and I found this movie to be authentic and factual including the food bounty at this country home, the friendships of both races, the love of the outdoors.  Enjoy!",1084060800,9,684,4.354330708661418
1690791,5,B000063K1C,"This movie was awesome, I was actually in Kelsey Keel's class in eighth grade and she is as sweet in real life.  I love this movie and would reccomend it to anyone!",1057708800,10,164,4.125
1690792,5,B000063K1C,"I don't know where to begin but this movie is going to be  a new classic for kids...move over Sounder, Anne of Green Gables, Treasure Island....I was entranced.  The actors in the movie are fabulous... I found myself making comments aloud about their acting throughout the film.  The themes are timeless and ones in which we can all relate.  The costumes are wonderful...I was taken back in time and couldn't leave my TV to even get a drink and I studied every detail of the dresses, hair, shoes, and makeup.  If you think history is boring, watch this movie...it all will change for you and you'll realize that we all aren't so different afterall.",1038009600,13,648,4.649122807017544
1690793,3,B000063K1C,"Although I have not seen this movie on the DVD format, I can say I saw it on VHS, and it's a clean wholesome family movie of a girl coming of age story in the south during the 50's. The story focuses on the family itself and the growing pains of a girl with no siblings.
(Taken from VHS cover....Based on the award winning book, ""My Louisiana Sky"" is a heartfelt portrait of one girl's emotional journey to a place she'd always dreamed of and the road back home.)
I rated it three stars cause I grew up with brothers, and there was little for me to relate to in this movie, Its a family kind of Hallmark film. I don't know if the movie has a rating, but its a definite G rating movie. Its kind of in the genre of ""Old Yeller"" by Disney.",1021939200,8,736,4.0479452054794525

1690826,5,B000063K1C,"Best coming of age movie I have seem in a LONG time. A young girl 12-14 years old, decides she will withstand ridicule and implications of lifestyle on order to live with her parents despite hardship.",1454025600,2,200,4.583333333333333

1690830,5,B000063K1C,I loved this move.  It's about a young girl coming of age who learns to accept people as they are and to love them for who they are.  It;s also a bout a young girl who tries to fit in when she  has what she thinks is an embarrassing problem.  There are moments of joy and time when you fell like crying.  It is also a movie that the entire family can enjoy and especially young people who are becoming adults.,1410220800,3,409,4.0
1690831,5,B000063K1C,"I recorded this on my DVR and watched it over and over. Then, when I pulled the plug on the Dish, it went away. I had the movie on my wish list for years.

1690845,5,B000063K1C,This is a sweet story about a young girl growing up in the South in the 50's. The lessons and values are timeless. It took me awhile to understand her parents were mentally challenged. I thought the mother was the sister.  Home is what really matters and the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence were 2 lessons that are reinforced in the movie.,1375056000,,366,4.304347826086956

1690847,4,B000063K1C,"This is a feel good movie with moments of sadness and a lot of family love and responsibility.  It's a good family movie but kids watching it should probably at least be teenagers since they do briefly discuss ""the curse"" in a humorous way.",1359936000,,240,4.454545454545454
1690848,5,B000063K1C,"DVD arrived in a promt manner. Excellent quality. Was informed when it shipped and was able to track it's progress. Enjoyed it very much, and have since loaned it to a friend.",1351123200,,175,4.5

1690850,5,B000063K1C,"This movie is so real and genuine to the culture and period it represents.  I like to watch this movie once a year, checking it out of the public library, when ever I do.

7959418,1,B000063K1C,"Very S-L-O-W movie. Yes, developmentally challenged characters but the movie doesn't have to be slow to make us understand it. Rather patronizing while slow to develop the characters and story. I could only watch the first half hour before I was too bored to continue. I know others like it so give it a try anyway.",1525046400,,315,4.642857142857143
7959419,5,B000063K1C,I liked this film a lot because of how people with developmental disabilities and traumatic brain injuries are capable and deserving of just as much love and respect as any other human being.
