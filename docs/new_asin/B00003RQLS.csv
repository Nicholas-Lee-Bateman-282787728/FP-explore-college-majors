1332333,2,B00003RQLS,"I have at least three reservations with this title, at first I was very anxious in waiting for it to arrive on my hands but as I was beginning to watch the documentary I was disappointed by some sections specially the Europian campaign section on the Global presentation. Although there was much material on this section I was not impressed because we all knew then that D-Day or ""fortress euoropa"" was fought on a vast region and there were lots of battles here. Maybe the majority of film on this part was on black and white. 2nd reason I was dissapointed was how each footage was presented, I hated the way they introduced each topic using that awful blue background. Lastly I was dissapointed because I wanted to see more but this title didn't satisfy my cravings. Hmmmm, maybe it was my fault, I expected too much. So guys if you are going to choose your first documentary on WWII don't depend on color there are lots of materials on ""black and white"".",1114992000,4,957,4.53757225433526
1332334,5,B00003RQLS,"This is the fifth ww2 colour dvd that I have added to my collection, and I can say that it is easily the best. While mainly focusing on the oft neglected Pacific theatre of war, the main feature has some absolutely amazing shots, including colour footage from cameras mounted in the nose of american fighters in vicious dogfights over the pacific ocean, closeup action of intense combat and unseen images of Hitler and his entourage in the Eagles Nest. The dvd is put together very well and while footage for some areas of the war are missing, the gaps are filled in well with informative commentary. The combat footage is easily the most unedited I have ever seen, and is not for the faint hearted. The only glitch in this otherwise perfect WW2 dvd is the American focus, which we have to accept so often when it comes to documentaries. (I recommend ""The British Story"" as an alternative view)",1055376000,9,894,4.628930817610063
1332335,4,B00003RQLS,"I have seen many documentries on WWII.  Most of those in black and white.  This surpasses much of the footage I have seen.  Finally being able to see it in color adds a whole new dimension on the war.  It makes you realize that this war was fought not that long ago, and the people who fought it, either at the front lines or on the home front are still alive today.  I am very glad to see it the way they saw it, raw and brutal and yet they are shown in alot of the footage with high spirits.  The footage of the poor Japanese lady and the cliff in the Saipan chapter will always haunt me.  This is the way war really is, and should be seen to fully understand its impact on those who fought it.",996883200,11,696,3.964028776978417
1332336,5,B00003RQLS,"I now have both this DVD, and the ""WWII: The Lost Color Archives"" (LCA) and they are both superb.  This one is a bit cheaper than TLCA but it complements it quite well, as it has far more coverage of the Pacific Theatre as well as European material not seen on TLCA.
This is a bit more graphic than TLCA, but it shows some incredible battle scenes in both N.Africa and Europe that are incredible!  It makes you wonder how did the cameraman survive being right there in the middle of the battle, with tanks rolling around him (her?) and machine gun fire only a few feet away.  The bombing runs of the Memphis Belle, from the perspective of those flying, are also here in spectacular fashion.  The scenes of the gunners firing away at incoming fighters are truly exceptional.
Though I would rate this a very tiny bit below TLCA, it is definitely worth getting, and is highly recommended.  A must buy for the WWII enthusiast and/or historian.",972000000,36,939,4.5325443786982245
1332337,5,B00003RQLS,"Wow! This is a very interesting way to see World War II as it happened!  I'm used to seeing WWII films and shorts (short films) in black and white.

1332358,3,B00003RQLS,"This is yet another series titled ""WWII in color"" but of the many labeled that way, this is the least interesting.  The feel you get with this DVD is that someone saw all the series titled that way and threw something together to get on the band wagon.  Kind of dissappointing, not cohsive at all, and a lot of rehashed video.",1364515200,,326,4.327868852459017
1332359,3,B00003RQLS,"The quality of the movie is only ok because of the poor resolution. However, this can be expected due to the old-age production. It seems the movie was produced in 1960s or 1970s but it's a great historical movie, so it's deserved an overall 3-star.",1359936000,,249,4.555555555555555
1332360,3,B00003RQLS,"The film footage here is great, but this is just a series of vignettes. There is very little history here, they skimmed over Guadalcanal with almost no mention of the naval battles. The DVD was cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for.",1359331200,,234,4.222222222222222

1332362,3,B00003RQLS,"The packaging (under several different covers) is a bit deceptive. One is led to think this will be a WW2 narrative mostly in color but it is not quite that. It is more a collection of available color (sometimes very washed out color at that) footage on various aspects of the war.

Strengths: Excellent footage of Tarawa, Midway, Okinawa and Aircraft Carrier life. The Normandy footage is certainly different and adds a bit to the overall picture.

Weaknesses: This will not give you an accurate narrative of the war. Europe is nearly overlooked. The Russians hardly mentioned. The usual Eva Braun footage is used for Hitler. (It does look crisp.) Essentially this is just material that plugs in a few holes visually. One must own the World at War, The War or quite a few other documentaries to get any kind of overview picture. Nearly every drop of footage is from the American perspective. The narration hasn't got a critical or scholarly bone in it's body. The music ranges from quite interesting to ludicrous travelogue jauntiness.

Who should get this? Only real WW2 students and aficionados.",1286582400,,1098,4.89247311827957

1332364,5,B00003RQLS,"Seeing things in color that I have always seen in black and white before somehow brings them closer to home - it makes it easier to identify with the people.  For me, this helps bring more immediacy to the stories my stepdad told me about his experiences in that war.",1163030400,5,267,4.34
1332365,4,B00003RQLS,"As a kid growing up in the forties I thought Europe was this awful, gray and grainy place full of rubble, death and suffering. That was the way it looked in the newsreels shown at the local movie houses at the time. Rubble, death and suffering it had in abundance but gray and grainy it was not, as this wonderful documentary exhibits.

  In 1942 following the tragic death of his wife in a plane crash, Clark Gable, the biggest movie star in the world at the time and 41 years old, enlisted in the Army Air Corps as a private. He became an officer, attended gunnery school in Florida and was assigned by General Hap Arnold to the 8th Air Force in Hanover, England. His mission was to gather a movie crew and fly combat missions over Germany while his crew filmed the action in color in the hope that footage of Clark Gable manning a gun on actual bombing missions would stimulate the enlistment of badly needed gunnery voluteers.

  Gable's crew shot 50,000 feet of color footage both on the ground in England and during the 5 combat missions Gable flew. The flip side of this DVD has an hours worth of the footage that was shot during Gable's tour of combat duty. That alone is worth the price of admission to this DVD.

  A side note is that Hermann Goering put a price on Gable's head and offered a reward to any German pilot who shot down Gable's plane. One came close enough to shoot the heel off his boot. General Arnold thought he had better get Gable out of there before he fell into Hitler's hands so after five missions he was reassigned back to the States to edit his film.",1139875200,5,1585,4.363945578231292
1332366,5,B00003RQLS,"The Second World War was one of the great catastophes to befall humanity, and one of the greatest challenges of the United States (and, of course, its many allies).  This film essentially comprises actual color footage of key American battles and incidents of World War II, as well as some captured home movies of Adolph Hitler in his ""Eagle's Nest.""

This is a very worthwhile DVD.  The narrative is unabashedly American-oriented, which fits with the film and attitudes of the times in which the films were taken.  There is something incredibly poignant about seeing actual footage of the men and boys (who would very shortly be men) going into action in places like Normandy Beach and Tarawa.  Many of these lads would not be coming back--these are not actors, this is the real deal.  Nothing can compare to this.

The film holds little back; there are some pretty graphic battle scenes complete with casualties.  If the media back then had been as it is today, the press would have portrayed the victories of Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Normandy, Guadacanal, Okinawa and other tough fights as gruesome American defeats due to the heavy casualties.  This film reminds us that the price of victory is likely not to be cheap.  Not a few of us have perhaps forgotten that, and the price that others have paid on our behalf.  I will ensure that my children watch this film for that reason.

By the way, on the reverse side of the DVD there is an old US Government orientation film narrated by Clark Gable.  It is a wonderful look at the attitudes of the times, as America geared up to fight the Germans over the skies of Europe.  Don't miss it.",1128643200,4,1632,4.641114982578397
1332367,3,B00003RQLS,"It is not a movie; it is a kind of documentary in color shooted by ordinary men during the Second World War. Look at the war in the way that your parents and grans parents have seen it in color. It is just different but the next time that I will seen a movie in black and white, I will have a good idea about the colors. It is interesting to buy if you wish to see the war in colors.",1118880000,2,383,3.740740740740741

7919301,4,B00003RQLS,"If you can stomach the number of errors and bits of misinformation (e.g., the narrator says repeatedly that the name of the first nuclear bomb exploded at the Trinity Test in New Mexico was ""Fat Man""; while it was similar in design to the Fat Man bomb detonated over Nagasaki, the bomb at Trinity did not have a name, though many at Los Alamos called it ""The Gadget"") this is a persistently interesting disc. It contains huge amounts of in color (that is, originally in color, not having gone through a colorization process) film footage, much of it not often seen, though much of it is familiar and it is fascinating to discover how much of it had been processed into black and white. This is not a coherent narrative of WW II and was not meant to be. The point is to show as much color film as possible. And some of it is impressively informative. For instance, I had never heard of German P.O.W.s helping the Allies by driving around with them in jeeps to yell at snipers and others that Paris had surrendered, yet here we see that very thing. If you try to watch all of this in one sitting, your attention can start to fade, but a bit at a time.

I'm a hardcore movie buff, loving the studio movies of the thirties and forties in particular. It doesn't bother me in the least seeing a movie in black and white, but seeing all of this in color brings an immediacy that is rare in war footage. This shows not just in big moments but in small ones. There is a fairly well known shot of a B-29 landing on Iwo Jima for the first time. In black and white it is hard to precisely what the nature of the stuff the plane is landing in, but in this footage you can see so clearly that it is just grated soil. It isn't a big thing, but shows so clearly how raw it all is, which is emphasized even more when a P-51 Mustang lands next. There are a huge number of additional documentaries and movies that add to the value of this disc. Again, I want to stress that there is little great film making here; just a lot of valuable raw footage. How helpful you find this might hinge on how much you know about WW II. I was ecstatic to see the U.S.S. Arkansas a couple of times in great footage showing it full length at Iwo Jima. In some documentaries on D-Day you can see it in footage bombarding the beach at Omaha; it is hard to get shots that allow you to tell it easily from the Texas from the Arkansas, since they are both pre-WW I dreadnoughts (Arkansas was the oldest waship in the U.S.). Their lines are so similar you either have to see their numbers - 33 for Arkansas versus 35 for Texas - or you have to get a peek at the back turrets. Texas had nine 14 inch cannons in three turrets while Arkansas has twelve 12 inch cannons in four turrets, but it is hard to make out the configuration in bombardment footage.

So, not a masterpiece, but a valuable addition to any collection of WW II film footage.",1478908800,3,2898,4.21981981981982

Unfortunately, I cannot give this title any more than 3 stars. Disc 2 was shorter than disc 1 in time, and the entire end of the war was largely forgotten.

7919304,4,B00003RQLS,"Some of the topics are just summarily covered and would have liked more in-depth footage, but for the cost of the used DVD it was still a good deal. The bonus movie narrated by Clark Gable was a surprising and interesting addition that really made the purchase a bargain. A lot of coverage I had not seen before or knew existed. Some quite graphic and factual evidence that wasn't glossed-over. Showed the air war as it really was, and I appreciated it.",1452816000,,453,4.536585365853658
7919305,4,B00003RQLS,"If you are like me and enjoy the study of World War II before giving information on this DVD I would like to say you need to start with ""WWII The Essential Collection"" This is a 22 hour masterpiece which covers every aspect of WWII in B/W. I learned more from this set than I learned in high school and college together. The price is just over $50 and worth every dollar. What you get in WWII in Color goes well with this set. It documents the horrors of this war as seen by the soldiers on the battle field and in color. It is three hours long and does not cover near the information in the B/W 22 hour collection, but there are added documents not found in the B/W 22 hour DVD. You should know the color DVD allows you to see the violence and brutality the GI's experienced first-hand. Just understand you are going to see the horror of WWII and much of this DVD is hard to watch and reminds me of Nam. If you were a part of Nam you will see much of the same. It is amazing how much these two wars have in common. .",1448928000,3,1017,4.014778325123153
