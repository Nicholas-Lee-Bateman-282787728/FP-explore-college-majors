8640167,5,B00I9I0PNM,"The Chuck series is so special for little ones, especially little boys who follow all things with wheels. Cute story lines, positive messages and quick and to the point so the DVD rolls from one story to the next and commands their attention.",1404432000,,242,4.651162790697675
8640168,5,B00I9I0PNM,"This is a great collection of Chuck & Friends episodes (10 in total) that all involve trucks!  My boys (5 and 7) have loved Chuck & Friends since they first came out and they still get excited over the show.  Yes these are episodes previously aired on television but my boys don't mind and they haven't seen them all either.  It is great to have the DVD to be able to watch Chuck & Friends whenever and wherever.  It is a wholesome show for kids where the characters are trucks, how can you go wrong!",1400976000,,500,4.231578947368421
