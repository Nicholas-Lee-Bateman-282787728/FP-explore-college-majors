2799953,5,B000OVLBG2,"When Jesse Stone was introduced as a supporting character in one of Robert B. Parker's Spenser novels, he was portrayed as about 25 years or so younger than Tom Selleck.  However, Selleck, who is always best as a cop or cowboy, makes Stone his own.  This telefilm, the third in the series, which was quite good in its original airing, is even better without the commercials (what isn't?), and will hold up over time as well as its star.",1183680000,,436,4.506329113924051
2799954,5,B000OVLBG2,"This second Jesse Stone made-for-tv movie again stars Tom Sellect as the flawed but likeable police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts, and an older Selleck proves he owns the role. Anyone who is familiar with Robert B. Parkers novels, Tom Selleck or the first movie will feel like they're visiting an old friend here.

In this movie, the body of a teenage girl is found floating in a local lake. With few clues and a local prime suspect who seems to be a step ahead of him, Stone's investigation eventually leads to Boston where he clashes with a local mob boss who seems to know the answers, but wants Stone to figure it out. Parallel to the murder, Stone also deals with a case of domestic violence that turns turns deadly, his alcoholism and feelings for his ex-wife, and a town council not sure if they picked the right person for the job.

Not to say this movie is for everyone. People who dislike Tom Selleck or the Parker novels obviously won't like it, nor will those video-game-raised folks who need constant chases, CGI augmentation and cardboard characters who don't get in the way of the gratuitous mayhem. Like all the Jesse Stone stories, this one is anchored on and driven by characters - how they interact, fail to interact, and how the weight of their pasts affect them as they try to make their way in the world. And the movie has the courage just to watch people thinking -- a rarity in any entertainment these days.

As of this writing, Parker has written six Jesse Stone novels, and Selleck has made four of them into movies. I heartily recommend you track down each one, buy it, and watch it over and over again. You won't be disappointed!",1183507200,4,1660,4.563758389261745
2799955,5,B000OVLBG2,"Tom Selleck was born to play Jesse Stone.  So much so that I can't imagine the character without Selleck.  I immediately loved ""Stone Cold"" when I saw it premiere on TV and I have enjoyed watching Jesse solve crimes ever since.

Death In Paradise is a great little movie with an engaging storyline, believable dialogue (like always), solid production work, and a fantastic cast.  I love the theme music for the series and the way that with just a couple simple piano themes so much mood can be conveyed.  I've seen all 4 of the Jesse Stone movies and I love them all.  I eagerly look forward to more!

I should note that I usually don't watch made for TV movies but I saw ""Stone Cold"" and I was hooked.  It is refreshing when CGI and all manner of film trickery isn't employed and the filmmakers must rely on good old fashioned storytelling.  The acting and the writing in this series is tremendous and needs no trickery to succeed.",1182902400,19,932,4.4674556213017755
2799956,1,B000OVLBG2,"exactly like the novel itself, this movie actually sucked big time. what we got here was a forever look tired jesse stone played by tom selleck, he walked the beat, chewing gum, pondering, walking around, talking around, drinking, looking so depressed and dispirited. a murder case that we might have already seen or read thousand times.

boring script with boring cliched dialog such as q and a:

q:'how could i compensate...' ,
a:'you can compensate...by making love to me...'

the scenario and the storyline were both extremely cliched and formulaic like the novel, there's nothing much to tell, so the space between lines got to be widened a lot, the font size also got to be larger and thicker than regular font, almost reached the size of large print one, so more pages, at lease 100 more pages, could be subtly added.

the movie, by the same token, did exactly as the novel: slow paced, lots walk around, talk around, lots sitting down, sipping drinks, pondering, sighing, interviewing, tough talks from some related suspects, some shootings.

a lame and bore-you-to-death ballooned tiny murder case, mysteriously added a female school superintendent with foreign accent and so predictably scripted as soon as jesse stone went to school, an inevitable sex relationship was doomed to happen.

so, what else is new? and what else you still want to know? for tom selleck himself, it's easy money by just walking around, talking some, chewing some, drinking some for two movies like this in a row.",1182124800,,1500,4.956175298804781
2799957,5,B000OVLBG2,"Tom Selleck IS Jesse Stone, a character created by the great mystery author Robert Parker. Selleck plays a burned out, alcoholic LA cop who takes a job in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts as sheriff. ""Death in Paradise"" is a tale of domestic violence, mob intrigue and the poignant, obsessive quest by the emotionally damaged Stone for the killer of a young girl. This story line actually occurred in the Parker series prior to the novel that was the basis for CBS's fabulously successful ""Stone Cold"", Selleck's first outing as Jesse Stone. The screenwriters tweaked the plot of ""Death in Paradise"" a bit to make it a sequel to ""Stone Cold"" with excellent results. ""Death in Paradise"" features a powerhouse cameo by Steven Baldwin. In my opinion, Parker's Jesse Stone series is head and shoulders above the famous Spencer books. The Stone made-for-TV movies are quality productions with superb acting, beautiful cinematography and haunting music. Exceptional TV. Highly, highly recommended.

2800041,5,B000OVLBG2,"Four and a half DETERMINED Stars. ""Death in Paradise"" is the TV-movie version of author Robert B. Parker's third novel, using the same title, in the popular Jesse Stone series of novels. It stars Tom Selleck as the star-crossed and quietly relentless sheriff of the coastal town of Paradise, Massachusetts.  Best enjoyed as a part of the series where the past of some characters is known to the viewer, this can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone story. The TV series does not exactly track with the novels: TV-movie ""Death in Paradise"" is followed by the TV-movie, ""Sea Change"".

The movie begins with ""Suitcase"" Simpson finding a decomposed body at water's edge and the chief begins a dogged investigation to identify the decomposed body and find the cause of death. Meanwhile, a serious personal matter within a family comes to the attention of the sheriff's office which then becomes an alternate storyline to the movie. The chief is still plagued with his own past demons. Co-starring an excellent cast of Viola Davis, Kohl Sudduth, Orla Brady, Gary Basaraba, JOhn Diehl, Debra Christofferson, Mae Whitman, Matt Barr, Edward Edwards, Brendan Kelly, Kerri Smith, Liisa Repo-Martell, and Carolyn Fitzgibbons, with Stephen McHattie, Steven Flynn, and William Devane. The acting is marvelous, especially the scenes between Selleck and Devane which are full of remarkably understated acting. The movie ends on a cliff hanger that is picked up in ""Sea Change. Directed by Robert Harmon, it is co-executive produced by Selleck who co-wrote the teleplay. Highly Recommended. Four and a half RELENTLESS Stars. (Sony Pictures. NR. Color. HD. CC.

2800134,4,B000OVLBG2,"I am systematically viewing all the Jesse Stone films and Death in Paradise is the third film in the series.  Thus far I have been pleased with these films, first because Tom Selleck does a fine job as Jesse Stone, chief of police in Paradise, Massachusetts, a small town outside of Boston.  Paradise is loosely modeled on Marblehead, a real town just north of Boston on the Atlantic Ocean.

The supporting cast is also excellent.  Let me single out William Devane as the psychologist Chief Stone consults for his problems with alcohol and his difficulties getting over his divorce.  Devane is a fine actor who not only helps Jesse with his personal problems, but also acts as a sounding board for his thoughts on his police investigations.

Typically, Chief Stone has two cases to resolve, one of these is a murder investigation and the other a problem involving a family in Paradise.  In Death in Paradise Chief Stone first tries to help a woman being abused by her husband.  As we will find out, this problem escalates into a major confrontation between Chief Stone and the husband.  No spoilers here.  Readers of this review must watch the film to find out what happens.

The more serious case involves the murder of a young girl who is found floating in the water of a large lake just outside of Paradise.  Chief Stone patiently makes his investigation, which leads him into confrontations with important political leaders and crime figures before he solves the case.  I followed the action of the story carefully and was not altogether pleased with the outcome, which seemed forced to me.  That said, I am still going to recommend this film because on balance it was well done.

Robert Harmon directs many of the films in the Jesse Stone series and he is a competent director.  He started his career as a photographer and cameraman.  His skills behind the camera are evident in all the films in the Jesse Stone series.  These films look good and give us a good feel for the time and place of the stories.  Additionally, Harmon brings out the best in his performers.  Even minor roles are well acted and directed.

Folks, these are TV movies, yet they seem to me to be as good or better than many of the big budget films turned out in Hollywood.  For the most part, the action is controlled and constrained, in keeping with Chief Stones character, which is laid back, quiet, and deliberate.  That is not to say that the films are boring  they are not, but those looking for car chases and violence will be disappointed, I think.

The Jesse Stone series is made for adults who want a mystery that is intelligent, well-directed, and entertaining.  Each film I have seen has those three attributes.  I look forward to seeing all the movies in this series and recommend Death in Paradise to my readers.",1458950400,,2803,4.66734693877551

2800221,5,B000OVLBG2,"Mr Tom Selleck has often been sold short, particularly in the early stages of his career when he appeared to be just another good - looking big guy, albeit one with a sense of humour.  More recently he has been flexing his acting chops and in the ""Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise"" he gives a performance well beyond the call of duty. Chief of a four person police department in a small coastal town,he is a man to inspire loyalty and confidence, respect and obedience; a remnant.  If you like of all our distant memories of what we would like small - town cops to be. He is not a perfect man by any means, arriving in Paradise on the back of a marriage break up and he has a drink problem that he seems unable to resolve. He is stubborn, principled, brave and flawed, not unlike Robert B.Parker's more famous character, Spenser. He does not show emotion but he is not emotionless. Mr Selleck portrays these complicated and contrary characteristics with very little indications other than the eyes.  Mostly he looks impassive but his true feelings are visible through his eyes.  It is an exceedingly impressive performance of a depth rarely seen in TV productions. The story is almost ancillary to the character development, Mr Selleck is obviously in this for the long run. Mr W.Devane is excellent as the cop - turned - shrink who dishes out tough love to Jesse at $180 per hour. Devane definitely contributes to the Jesse Stone films.  Lovers of Mr Parker's novels will appreciate the characters that cross from the Spenser series, Commander Healey of the State Police and Gino Fish the Boston mobster with a whimsical turn of mind.

Selleck is just perfect as the flawed, but honorable main character. What makes this series so good; the pacing of the films is thoughtful; the characters are adult and complex; it has plot and intelligence over car crashes and special effects though it has action and romance in it to be sure. You like Selleck's character instantly and his scenes with his other officers, the State Police Detective and the shrink he see's about his drinking, are all terrific.  This film has some very touching moments, particularly involving Jesse's two main supporting officers, Suit and Molly. It's a bit like Gunsmoke in Paradise, with Chester and Kitty and Doc.

Not to say this movie is for everyone. People who dislike Tom Selleck or the Parker novels obviously won't like it, nor will those video-game-raised folks who need constant chases, CGI augmentation and cardboard characters who don't get in the way of the gratuitous mayhem. Like all the Jesse Stone stories, this one is anchored on and driven by characters - how they interact, fail to interact, and how the weight of their pasts affect them as they try to make their way in the world. And the movie has the courage just to watch people thinking -- a rarity in any entertainment these days.  The violence is minimal for most of the movie, though there is some blood in a couple of scenes. The language is stronger than one might normally hear on network TV, but not quite like 'NYPD Blue'.

I wholeheartedly recommend the ""Jesse Stone"" series to all lovers of joined - up TV cop shows.

SPOILER ALERT
In this drama, Jesse Stone has settled into life as the police chief of the small New England town of Paradise, Massachusetts when the body of a teenage girl is found floating in a local lake.  The Chief of Police Jesse Stone and his officer Simpson  seek clues in the spot. Through a class ring of a student that they find near the corpse, they identity the dead girl, the local slut Billy Bishop.  Stone discovers that the once straight-A student had started down a path of self-destruction and was estranged from her parents, who never reported her missing.  With little to go on, the investigation takes Stone to the city where he rubs the Boston mob the wrong way.

As he tries to focus on finding out what happened to the girl, Stone must also deal with a case of domestic violence that ultimately turns deadly. But as the investigation into the teen's death unfolds and he learns more and more about the girl's unhappy past,

Stone finds himself slowly becoming obsessed with the case and is steadfastly determined to bring the girl's killer to justice.  Along his investigation, Stone discloses that the famous writer Norman Shaw was too much close to the victim and intended to write the biography of the famous gangster Leo in his next book. Joining the pieces of evidences like a puzzle, Stone unravels the identity of the criminal.",1443484800,,4533,4.694829760403531

2800361,4,B000OVLBG2,"""Death in Paradise"" is the third of the TV movies starring Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone, the police chief of the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts.  This story begins with the discovery of the body of a young girl in a lake.  Stone and his handful of deputies will follow a thin trail of clues, some of them confusing, while stepping on toes inside and outside the town.  The clues lead to a possible child molester, but that might not be the end of the trail.  Jesse, haunted by the death of the young girl, will go to great lengths to learn the truth, risking all in a shocking final show down.  There is a very powerful side plot involving a case of domestic abuse that goes badly wrong.

As in the other Jesse Stone movies, the pacing is quite deliberate, even meditative, and centers strongly on the troubled but determined Jesse Stone, played to perfection by Selleck.  Part of the interest in the story is that the audience gets the clues at the same rate as the characters.  The cast is well chosen and Nova Scotia stands in nicely for Massachusetts as a setting.  Highly recommended as good and thoughtful entertainment.",1419811200,,1131,4.5594059405940595

2800483,4,B000OVLBG2,The Jesse Stone Series was well done from the very beginning.  Tom Selleck is the ideal character fit.  He uses his actual life experiences to enhance the character rather than faking it.,1402790400,,187,4.8125
2800484,4,B000OVLBG2,Tom Selleck doesn't get enough credit for quality work. The Jesse Stone series are well done with nicely crafted scripts and plots which is unusual for American productions lately.,1402617600,,180,5.241379310344827

2800497,4,B000OVLBG2,Jesse Stone is a great series. Would recommend the series as Tom Selleck is terrific in the role of Jesse Stone.,1402444800,,112,4.380952380952381
2800498,3,B000OVLBG2,"I love Tom Selleck, but Jesse Stone? Not so much. Selleck does what he can, but in fact, after watching three of these, I'm more than a little tired of many of Jesse's little quirks which are clearly supposed to be endearing but in fact are simply annoying. Rose (the always wonderful Kathy Baker) confronts him about being unable to reach him: Jesse, why don't you get a cellphone? Cause I don't like em; you can always page me. I have! Well, call me on the car radio. I have!"" His mantra to the town council: ""You can always fire me, but you can't tell me what to do."" His sophomoric refusal to wear his badge, leaving him endlessly answering, when asked for it: ""It's in a drawer"". The first time this happened was OK, but after that it got old. Would Jesse not write a ticket if someone told him their driver's license was in a drawer? Yeah, I didn't think so. Also, starting with the first episode, when he arbitrarily decides to call Luther ""Suit"", a nickname Luther neither asked for nor particularly likes (but which is supposed to show us how very knowledgeable Jesse is about baseball, among other things, I guess): in that same episode, when DiAngelo addresses Jesse as ""Skipper"", Jesse wastes no time letting him know that it's not OK to call him anything but his name, because although Jesse will call anyone anything he wants to, he will not tolerate anyone else doing the same thing. And don't get me started on his endless, pathetic, carrying of the torch for his whiny, self-centered ex, ""Jen"". If Jesse were Jessie, pining away for her ex husband, maybe more viewers would be inclined to see this for the pathetic neurosis it really is instead of viewing it as cute and romantic and evidence of emotional depth, which it's not. Selleck is a good actor who has gotten better at what he does over the years; too bad that's not true for Jesse Stone.",1402012800,,1864,4.517751479289941
2800499,5,B000OVLBG2,I love the Jesse Stone movies.  This one was really good.  They couldn't have picked a better person to play Jesse Stone.,1401926400,,121,4.454545454545454
2800500,5,B000OVLBG2,"Tom Selleck brings Jesse Stone to life once again.  He is an excellent actor, and excellent in this part.  There is suspense and action in this made for TV movie.",1401926400,,162,4.366666666666666

2800503,4,B000OVLBG2,"He doesn't act, but he doesn't need to.  I actually like this more than his TV show.  A lot of the movie choices were not very enticing.",1401840000,,136,4.0
2800504,4,B000OVLBG2,"This rating is for the entire series not just this one movie. I give this show a weak four stars versus a strong four stars due to the quirks that don't make much sense and don't really add to the movie. I think they were trying a little too hard to develop the characters. One example is a counselor that Jesse Stone is seeing. He smokes like a chimney during their sessions which I find a bit odd, but the larger oddity is the counselors quirk of frequently wiping his bottom lip on his shirt. That just looks ridiculous and adds absolutely nothing to the show. As matter of fact it is quite distracting. It would not be a big deal if the camera did not purposely zoom in on the guy to ensure that you see him doing that weird lip-wipe. Again, this is just one example of useless, nonsense that I assume is supposed to add to the guy's character. I think it makes him look more foolish than he already does. He dresses like a homeless guy too which just doesn't do anything but make me wish they would move on to the next scene that much quicker. If you saw the movie ""Langoliers"" one character who slowly went crazy was always tearing strips off of paper towels (or something). They would zoom in on him tearing those strips. One would think this means those strips must be a clue or a key aspect to the plot. It was not. It was just some guy tearing paper which added absolutely nothing to the movie. Yet the camera kept zooming in on him tearing paper and play ""scary"" music like it meant something. That is how the lip-wipe and some other quirks seem, just a waste of film and airtime.

All and all, I think they have created an interesting dynamic. The pace is a little slow at times but those scenes do add to the overall dynamic of the show. Just when they lull you into imagining white, picket fences and rainbows, guns start blazing. This dynamic keeps me watching more intently as I anticipate the action scenes that often just creep up on you. Also, you never know which characters are going to be alive at the end of each of these movies. I could have done with a few less quirks.

In this day and age, I think this show has captured a little allure of the black and white films mainly due to the writing, casting, and character development yet is still a very modern movie.
Most people who enjoy a little drama as well as relating to characters should like this movie. Even the slow scenes are interesting and adds meaning to the overall mood of the show.",1401753600,,2470,4.309677419354839
2800505,4,B000OVLBG2,"I was turned onto ""Spenser"" around 1989 or so.  Since then I've read and owned every Robert Parker book (not just the Spenser series).  I think it's a perfect role for Tom Selleck and the internal demons of alcohol he continuously battles with the aid of William Devane.  No need for special effects, graphic violence and spectacular crap!  It's old school filmmaking and storytelling!",1401667200,,385,4.96875
2800516,5,B000OVLBG2,Just like all of the other Jessie Stone movies had twists and turns but the unflappable Jessie gets his man.,1401580800,,108,4.45
2800517,5,B000OVLBG2,"The only problem with the Jesse Stone series is that there are not enough episodes.  The languid pace of the film mirrors the feeling of the small town.  Selleck carries the internal fury and confusion from his past life without it being the center point of the storyline.  Sit back, take a deep breath, relax, enjoy.  No car chases.  No stupid antics.  Just good writing, good acting, believable characters, and two hours well spent.",1401580800,,434,4.797297297297297

2800689,4,B000OVLBG2,"Good performance as an aging , experienced police officer.  Seems to have more skill than I believe most Police Officers.  Plays the part of an alcohol a bit different than I belIeve realistic.  Anyone who drinks that much cannot  be ready to go in the morning. And certainly can't sort out criminal activities quickly and clearly.  However, I like anything  Tom Selleck does, starting with Magnum PI.
If you like Selleck, you will like Jesse Stone.",1390003200,,449,4.842105263157895

2800716,5,B000OVLBG2,"I think I've seen four of the Tom Selleck/Jesse Stone movies and each one has been very good. The story, acting, character are all top notch. The setting on the coast of Massachusetts is really great with scene after scene of breathtakingly beautiful shots of the sea, town and historic old homes.

Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as the alcoholic cop who has reached the end of his career options - the experienced cop from the big city with nowhere else to go, no one else to take a chance on him. But he's a good cop who doesn't take any guff from anyone, including his bosses on the town council.

Death in Paradise may be a bit predictable in places, but is very watchable and entertaining because of all the good things going on here. I rate it five stars - way more satisfying than all the newer movies that are nothing more than a collection of computer generated special effects shows.",1389657600,,892,4.466257668711656

2800719,4,B000OVLBG2,"Tom Selleck portrays a police officer who appears to be a ""has- been"" fraught with the emotional baggage of a failed marriage, too many scotches, and a pink slip from his law enforcement Captain.  But for Jesse, down is not out.  He becomes both the rescued and the rescuer as he begins again as police chief in the small town of Paradise, solves local crimes, provides leadership for the rudderless police department, begins controlling his alcohol intake, tries to resolve his ambivalent feelings for his ex and steps into new relationships.
The anguish that appears on his furrowed brow, in his voice and rests in his eyes is portrayed adoritly by Selleck.
You feel his pain but just before despondency decends, hope creeps slowly over the horizon.",1389312000,,751,4.905511811023622

Every one of the Stone series movies has a believable plot and is cast pretty well. I would have given it 5 stars, but I found the constant phone calling by the ex-wife annoying. I would have liked to see Stone man up just a little bit more when dealing with her. She is the one who had the affair which caused Stone to go off and find solace at the bottom of a bottle which cost him his career. One gets that he loves her, just that Stone comes across a bit to much as a masochistic doormat for me.",1389139200,,601,4.0588235294117645

2800753,5,B000OVLBG2,"I highly enjoyed another segue of Tom Selleck in the his role as Jesse Stone. I love when a movie provides a plot that involves the ""who done it"" theme. Another satisfying point of enjoyment is that ""justice"" is done in a way that gives some closure to victims. I also found it insightful how the writer made the members of the city council ""bad guys"" not interested the pursue of justice, but only in their agenda. I highly recommend this movie and other's in the ""Jesse Stone"" series to those interested in a good plot, human frailties and the struggles to do the right thing.",1382054400,,578,4.462264150943396

2800772,5,B000OVLBG2,Hey Tom Selleck is a very good actor and I like him in everything he has done. In the Jesse Stone series he is an alcoholic ex-LAPD officer who has been let go because of his drinking. He gets hired by a small town out East by the mayor who believes he will be easy to manipulate since the mayor is laundering money for the mob. Jesse takes charge from the start and so the series goes from plot to plot. The only thing that I find interestingly out side normal scenarios is the number of deaths in the movies. I think there are a lot for a supposedly small town. Of course they have to try to keep our interest. Anyway I still like them.,1379462400,3,638,4.071428571428571

2800825,4,B000OVLBG2,"These Tom Selleck movies are excellent adaptations of the books.  The dialogue, especially between the Jesse main character and his ex-cop shrink (William Devane) is just priceless.  I would guess that author Parker either was an alcoholic or knew someone closely.  He captures the persona and struggles.  I hope this team continues to make new versions; even though the author has passed (RIP), the two post-homous (sp?) movies were just as good.  Watch the whole series, they are all excellent.",1373068800,,496,5.15

Robert Parker had written more books, howe ver, much to my chagrin, Tom Selleck has not made them into movies.  You will love the series of Jesse Stone.  You can watch these movies with your youngstrs or your oldsters and never be ashamed. Tom Selleck is a marvvelous movie maker.  There are eight Jessie Stone movies, I wish there were more.

2800833,5,B000OVLBG2,"Before we happened to see one of the eight made-for-TV films in this series, our impression of Tom Selleck was limited to having seen a few episodes of Magnum, P.I., quite a few years ago, and we were not among his fans.  That was then.  As Jesse Stone, Selleck is superb, and we have become quit addicted to the series of films.  The first one we saw was Sea Change, quite by accident.  We did not know there were others, and it happens that Sea Change is Number 4.

We could not resist seeing more of Jesse, so we did the research to find all eight of the films and to list them in proper sequence.  Then, we started with Number 1, Night Passage, and went through all eight of them, including a repeat of Sea Change.  Each film can stand alone, complete in itself, but with something at the end which whets one's appetite for the next one.  Besides, you just want to get back to Jesse and Reggie and Suitcase and Rose and all the rest.

Selleck says he is not through with Jesse Stone, but he may not make any more of the films with CBS.  We eagerly await news of Number 9.

Look, these are not Oscar-winning films.  They are not intended to be.  They are great entertainment, filled with characters we get to know and like.  Jesse is a very likeable and human character, a police chief with a highly developed ""coply instinct""  who struggles with his own humanity.

Even if you do not normally like ""cop films""--we don't--you may be surprised at how strongly these will grab you.  Here is the full list, in order:

Night Passage
Stone Cold
Death In Paradise
Sea Change
Thin Ice
No Remorse
Innocents Lost
Benefit of the Doubt",1371686400,,1627,4.366666666666666

On a cold rainy day, the body of a young, abused, teenage girl is found floating in the lake and Jesse gets obsessed with finding out why. As with most Robert B. Parker novels, the story is very solid, and this one was especially good, because it brings Jessie Stone right to the edge, and I feel like you really get to know him more intimately from this story. Tom Selleck, AKA Magnum P.I., once again is in a familiar role and makes the story that much stronger. I can't say much more without giving stuff away, but the ending is quite unexpected.",1361577600,,660,4.330645161290323

My only complaint is that there is little action and a lot of whispy music between little dialogue. In great measure, that is intentional because that enhances the same feeling about the Jesse Stone character.

I recommend the whole series and can't wait for more. But, don't expect new releases to come along quickly, Selleck has other irons in the fire, and these are low-budget project films.",1355875200,,523,4.943181818181818

Selleck does a good job in the role of Jesse and the supporting cast is more than adequate.  I particularly enjoy all of the scenes with William Devane.

2801028,4,B000OVLBG2,"I adore this mystery series with its vulnerable, flawed, whip-smart detective protagonist, original plots, fresh dialog, stunning scenery, lyrical and haunting music and authentic sets. Series that are based on actual novels--like this one based on Robert Parker novels--seem to have have more of a richness, and depth of detail that come from a 300 page book vs. a script that was written in a few weeks for a weekly series. In any series, one is going to prefer some shows over others and this one I felt needed a tad more ""denouement""--in which the crime is explained, the villain unmasked etc--as my writing instructor would say.

It just ended more abruptly than I would have wished. The main story line itself was pretty intriguing, but when it ended, found myself thinking, now what happened?

Of course, this may be more like real life so others may prefer this more sudden end.  It may just be a matter of taste.  This is worth watching--see what you think of how it comes together at the end....",1338163200,,1005,4.725714285714286

That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. The supporting cast is top notch. My favorite scene in ""Death in Paradise"" is when Jesse reads a book about Harry Simpson to ""Suit"". Satisfying storytelling.",1327622400,,753,5.080645161290323

this adventure has Stone investigating the brutal murder of a troubled teenage girl found floating in a local lake.  He discovers that once she was a straight A student, but somehow wound up on a path of self-destruction, possible drugs, and untimely death.

the few clues he has lead him to the girl's school, her family, and a old boyfriend.  Left at the crime was a high school class ring (men's)  and a necklace belonging to the victim.

Stone must also battle his own inner demons of alcohol abuse as he tries to solve the case.

2801105,4,B000OVLBG2,"Tom Selleck returns in the third of the series of TV movies based on Jesse Stone, the dogged and flawed small town police chief, as written by Robert Parker.
This time round, the story revolves around a young teenager's murder, following her badly decomposed body being discovered 3 weeks after her disappearance.  As before, the story is told in a nuanced and unflinching style, with atmospheric bleak music and dark cinematography.  What makes these movies so satisfying is the sense that they are so believable - whether it is the matter of fact way he deals with the crimes, or the sideline plots of domestic violence, or just Jesse Stone's inherent flaws which make him believably human.  He drinks.  He still harbours a little flame for his ex-wife.  The action when it happens is sparse and final.
Previous entries have been solid 4 stars reaching towards the 5th... this one struggles a little to get that 4th star, having a few too many familiar elements from before - the woman of the episode, to act as a foil to Stone's character issues, the last minute tete a tete with the who of the whodunnit, wrapping things up just a little too succinctly.  Having said that, it earns the 4 stars, primarily thanks to Selleck who just gets better and better as he ages.
Recommended, above par TV movie.",1252022400,3,1303,4.692982456140351

2801118,5,B000OVLBG2,"The Jesse Stone movies are not just average police procedurals but truly intelligent & engaging films. Tom Selleck does an excellent job in the title role of police chief Jesse Stone who is still battling some inner issues like his penchant for drinking. By now, Jesse is well-established in the small town of Paradise, MA and even visits a shrink in order to resolve his personal problems.

Each Jesse Stone instalment deals with some sort of crime, and in this movie, the story revolves around the murder of a straight-A student. There might be a link to the Boston mob, and this itself would keep Stone busy, but then he also has to deal with a case of domestic violence in town.

The dialogue is fresh, as it is throughout the series, and Tom Selleck is magnetic in his portrayal of the complex police chief Stone. This is a well-made police procedural that is high on storytelling and will appeal to fans of the genre. I would recommend watching ""Night Passage"" first to those who are new to the series, followed by ""Stone Cold"" and then ""Death in Paradise.""",1245542400,,1063,4.619047619047619

Jesse Stone absolutely fits Selleck like a glove. I especially like the very strong sense of melancholy that seems to envelope this character. With what's gone on his life previously and more recent happenings he's got to really push himself to get on with life. The stories are enormously interesting - not great but they don't have to be the way they are brought to life in these films. Great to see Viola Davis in these and you can see the evolution of her acting leading to the sensational picture-stealing role in ""Doubt"". Also loved the few but enormously effective scenes between Selleck and William Devane as his shrink(also a recovering alcoholic)- such an easy, natural give and take between those two. The one thing that rankled just a bit is the way the females just want to throw themselves into bed with Jesse but then again, given the apparent competition......
Wonderful series. Hope Selleck and Harmon do many more.",1244678400,3,1065,4.762162162162162

In this series a more mature but still incredibly handsome Tom Selleck plays the character of the Chief of Police of a small New England town called Paradise, Massachusetts.

Jesse Stone is a former Los Angeles homicide detective who left life in the big city and is now underemployed, but still doing service to the community, which he loves. He is divorced from the ""only woman he is able to love"" and battles against alcoholism.

While life in Paradise is slow and for the most part the Chief of Police only gives out traffic or parking tickets, a series of murders take place, and in this episode a young student is murdered and a wife is battered by her alcoholic husband.

Don't miss it, the pace is slow but introspective, the plot is deep and intelligent, and you are left with feeling admiration for a man that has done wrong things while always attempting to do what is right!",1215907200,,1059,4.534031413612565

2801161,5,B000OVLBG2,"Tom Selleck stars again as Robert B. Parker's flawed police chief Jesse Stone, balancing professional challenges, a drinking problem and lingering repressed feelings for his ex-wife. The fact that Stone is flawed just like the rest of us, and yet the compassionate ""hero"" of the film, brings a grim authenticity to the table, enabling the viewer to journey more deeply into the story. Robert Harmon (director) and his production team yet again acheive an atmosphere of almost film noir edginess. The dialogue rings true and demonstrates much respect for Parker's original dialogue in the books. Stone (beautifully realized by Selleck) is efficient and dry in his language ... ""I'm the police chief, I know everything"", not unlike Parker's other literary sleuth, Spenser. In fact, now that Robert Urich is no longer with us, Selleck would make an ideal Spenser. Although a small town, Paradise, MA is not exempt from the crime, scandal and corruption imbedded in any other town, big or small. At the end of the day, Stone's experience and quiet tenacity ultimately find the truth. Now that ""Sea Change"" has been released (the fourth and most recent of the Jesse Stone films), I have seen all four, and can attest to their high quality on every level.",1204156800,,1249,4.980861244019139

2801163,4,B000OVLBG2,"Both sensitively acted and directed, ""Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise"" is another winner in the ""Jesse Stone"" series of television films.  Star Tom Selleck and director Robert Harmon must really be committed to this series, as every aspect of these productions are top notch.

Of course, one can air a minor complaint here and there.  For example, like the previous entry, ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"", this one ends a little too neatly and abruptly (just like in ""Passage"", everything is explained and resolved during a closing shoot-out), but that's only a small negative in an overall very good adaptation.  I'm certainly onboard for ""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"", the fourth movie in the series (I always wait for the DVD releases of these films because I hate all the television commercials).

By the way, as these reviews are supposed to be ""helpful"", here's the order that I recommend that these stories should be watched:

1)  Jesse Stone: Night Passage...  This was the second film to be produced, but chronologically (as it recounts Chief Stone's earliest days as Paradise's police chief) it takes place first.  For example, a character who is killed in ""Stone Cold"" (the first film produced) is seen good as new here, because of this story's earlier time frame.  Trust me, watch this one first.

2)  Stone Cold...  The first film produced, but if you watch it second, you'll enjoy the seamless transition from ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"" into ""Stone Cold"".  This also gives the aforementioned death in this movie more dramatic heft, because we've already seen Jesse spend a lot of time with the character in question in ""Passage"".

3)  Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise... This one picks up directly after the events in ""Stone Cold"", even though it was produced right after the origin story that was ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"".

4)  Jesse Stone: Sea Change...  Fourth film to be produced, fourth film you should watch.  This one's easy enough, at least, right?

One final thought, if you enjoy these TV films, you should try the Robert B. Parker novels in which they're based.  The films are very close to the novels, but the novels give you more details, a less compressed pace, and more vivid characterizations.  But make no mistake, the movies are definitely worth seeking out, too.",1201824000,137,2291,4.939790575916231

The movie itself has you wondering who really is the bad guy, there appear to be at least three. When you think you know who the bad guy really is, a twist is presented that leads you down another avenue.  Right up until the end one is never really sure who did the deed.

2801166,4,B000OVLBG2,"I've read all of Robert B. Parker's Spenser books, and then my ladyfriend picked me up one of his Sunny Randall books - mistakenly thinking that's what I liked.  I'd actually been getting a little tired of the Spenser books as I think the basic concept's starting to become a little dated - really, who would actually answer to the name ""Hawk?""  I didn't much care for Sunny Randal either - but Jesse Stone made an appearance in the book.  Here, I thought, was a character with some depth.  Moving through his life trying to adhere to a set of principles values while, at the same time, also struggling with his inner demons - now that's a flawed hero I can identify with.  I found this movie at my local Blockbuster, loved it, and have since bought it and the two other Jesse Stone movies that are currently available.  I think Tom Selleck did a much better job in these movies than he ever did in his 'Magnum PI' series.  I'm also anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the fourth.  The only reason I rated it four stars instead of five was because of some continuity flaws from movie to movie.",1190246400,3,1095,4.412935323383085
2801187,4,B000OVLBG2,"I have to agree with practically everyone else in applauding Tom Selleck in this role. I have never disliked Selleck, but he has never been one of my favorite actors, probably because I didn't see him in much. Nevertheless, that he fits this role like a glove, or vice versa, is undeniable.

Although I really enjoyed this move, and highly recommend it, I cannot honestly say it was as good as the first one - ""Stone Cold"". Primarily because the conclusion comes rather abruptly and unexpectedly. (I have not seen Night Passage as I write this.)

Don't get me wrong, it is a very good movie, the plot is good, the movie is very smart, suspenseful, and well-written, overall, however, it just wasn't as good as Stone Cold. The scenes with William Devane are very good and I wish there was more of him (Devane) in the movie.

Many movies may have a big star or 2 in them, but the movie itself is driven by the plot. The 2 Jesse Stone movies I have seen, are driven by the character, i.e. Jesse Stone. The plots are still excellent in both movies, but they never surpass Jesse Stone as the focus of the movie. And in this instance, that is perfectly fine because the character and Selleck's portrayal are fascinating.

I anxiously waited the continuation.  However, Death in Paradise, dosnt pick up right after and in following the prequel Night Passage.
This to me was really disappointing.  Instead of picking up right from the
ending of Night Passage, it takes off what appears as probably several months or longer after Night Passage, and leaves the viewer with the sense of missing time, from where Night Passage ended and Death in Paradise picks up....

He has certainly not let me down.  I am not sure whether there will be any more, but I absolutely hope so. You will not regret getting this DVD.",1184803200,,302,4.2631578947368425
2801193,5,B000OVLBG2,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Jesse Stone DVDs I purchased from you. Tom Selleck is perfect for this role. The stories are interesting, and the scenery is beautiful, and I believe Tom has this character right down to a T. I intend to buy each one, as they become available, and I hope Tom does them all.",1184716800,,303,4.333333333333333
2801194,5,B000OVLBG2,I have seen two other movies featuring Jesse Stone and I rate this one the same as I would rate the others.  Sea Change and Stone Cold.  I also have read the books featuring the same character and I feel that Tom Selleck portrayed Jesse perfectly.  I hope that you continue to carry any other of these when they are produced.  This review also includes Night Passage with the same statement and rating.,1184284800,,402,4.465753424657534
2801195,5,B000OVLBG2,"This is an excellent series and I look forward to more.  Tom Selleck portrays Parker's Jesse Stone as multilayered, flawed hero who has honor.",1184284800,,142,4.916666666666667
2801196,5,B000OVLBG2,"It might surprise viewers who only remember Tom Selleck from the Magnum series, but he has developed into a damn fine actor. Character development dominates the Jesse Stone series of films. Selleck has added a few nice touches to the title character from the novels of Robert B. Parker. In addition to Selleck all four of the Jesse Stone films feature a cast that fully compliments the lead actor. It's nice to know that it's still possible to watch films that make you think, unlike the steady stream of movies that offer only sensationalism, special effects, or mindless attempts at humor.",1183680000,2,591,4.861386138613861
