8537986,5,B009950Q9W,This DVD shows you how to start a simple character class from the beginning.  I strongly recommend it if you have already taken character classes as part of your training and you are familiar with the steps.,1380672000,,207,4.594594594594595
8537987,5,B009950Q9W,"Thank you, Inna, for providing character dance teachers with another really fine DVD. It shows very detailed instructions on how to teach character dance, from very simpl to more complicated steps.
 Your DVD shows  basic steps at the bar and steps for 5 different dances in the center as well as very precise explanations. Even for experienced teachers (I was a soloist dancer in Moisseiev Dance Company) it is very helpful.
 We are eagerly awaiting your next inspiration.

8537988,5,B009950Q9W,"This is not a DVD of a class, as such. It is a clear list of the steps found in a character class, how to do them, and how to teach them. Instructions include head and arm movements, and how to build on the steps and progress into combinations. The teacher shows a fine attention to detail, and you can see how she produces such lovely dancers.",1350604800,6,344,4.149253731343284
8537989,5,B009950Q9W,"Thanks Inna for all of your work cataloguing  these steps in detail so that they will not be forgotten. All of us who love Character dance thank you. This is a great reference work for an art which is being forgotten. Thanks to these videos these steps, variations and modifications will be preserved for the future.",1350086400,4,316,4.642857142857143
