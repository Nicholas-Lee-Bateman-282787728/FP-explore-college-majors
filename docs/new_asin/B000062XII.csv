8479096,5,B000062XII,"This is a very interesting and gripping mystery.  All the acting is superb.  It's the middle story of a three story set - all good.  The first, Strong Poison, deals with Harriet Vane's trial for and acquittal of murder charges, thanks to the efforts of Lord Peter Whimsey, a wealthy man and amateur detective.  Have His Carcase tells about Ms. Vane's walking tour of the North Country and finding a dead man on the beach.  Is it murder or suicide?  Finally, Gaudy Night tells about Ms. Vane's attendance at her college gaudy rewunion and some vengeful person causing serious incidents.  She finally agrees to marry Lord Peter.  These are all great fun for anyone who likes mysteries.",1355443200,,683,4.777777777777778
