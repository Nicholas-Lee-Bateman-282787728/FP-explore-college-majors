8207769,3,B000T4T91S,"I really wanted to like ""Xenosaga."" As sci-fi, the show has a fantastic post-earth premise.  The art is well done and the characters are generally compelling. The Gnosis are the type of antagonists that you love to hate. Then comes KOS-MOS. While she may appear to be a vixen, KOS-MOS is really an android super hero who may be the only thing that can save the human race. The mysterious KOS-MOS immediately jumps the shark. For starters, she's an unsympathetic character. KOS-MOS' abilities are entirely unbelievable and her design is clearly a desperate attempt to appeal to the adolescent male demographic. While I could have made my peace with a smaller dose of KOS-MOS, she's a central figure. After watching the first disc, I decided that I couldn't go any further. In the spirit of disclosure, I never played the game so my review is entirely based on the merits of the show. Unless you're watching the show as an extension of your love of the video game, like minded anime fans should first check out something like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Operators/dp/B000IHYVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Operators</a>."" ""Xenosaga"" has much going for it but in the end, there's better anime out there.",1264636800,2,1260,5.363636363636363
8207770,4,B000T4T91S,"This anime is very good and closely follows the original story save for a few things.

1. I don't like cherenkov getting the axe right away, I think his personal story had an extremly sad story that the anime really could have focused on.

2. By continuing virgils arc further they removed key parts of the original games plot, I won't spoil for those who haven't played the game but those that have know what I am talking about.

3. In the game albedo had many different lines that made him cruel, in the anime they rushed albedo's storyline to game three which showed the real reason for him being what he was. I didn't like the way they did this with the dream sequence.

4. Shions scream in the anime was forced to many times. In the game you didn't hear the scream until the final game in a certain scene.

Those are my four complaints with the anime, I didn't mind the kirschwasser storyline to much it was a welcome repreive. I recommend that whoever likes the anime please purchase the first game to get the fullt story and if your not hooked by the end of the first game then you were not meant to play xenosaga. Word of advice, it can get repetative towards the end, just stick to your guns and you'll be in for a treat. All in all the anime isn't bad but they could have done better by sticking to the original story more closely.",1249084800,,1341,4.284584980237154
8207771,3,B000T4T91S,"Humans have abandoned the planet Earth after the invasion by the merciless Gnosis.

Welcome to the anime series ""Xenosaga"" based on the popular Namco RPG video game series on the PlayStation 2.

The story revolves around the character Uzuki Shion, a chief engineer of the Vector Corporation who is working on a top secret weapon (android) known as KOS-MOS, humankind's latest resort to fight against the Gnosis.

The planet Earth is literally non-existent and during this time, humans and their android creations known as Relians co-exist in the universe. But of course, there are many humans who refuse to acknowledge androids as a separate living entity.

The Gnosis are after the Zohar , something that the crew of the Woglinde currently has and it leads the Gnosis to attack the crew of the spaceship Woglinde, the same ship that the main character Uzuki Shion is part of.

While the crew of the Woglinde are under attack, KOS-MOS android automatically switches on to defend Uzuki but as for defending the ship and Zohar against the Gnosis (which the android is programmed to do), KOS-MOS doesn't do a thing.

Thus the first four episodes pretty much introduces many characters and follows the crew before and after the attack from the Gnosis.

If anything, I was a bit curious of how they would take a complicated storyline from the videogame (3 lengthy Xenosaga RPG videogames for the PS2) and try to make it to a 13-episode TV series.

But so far with the first four episodes, I found ""Xenosaga"" entertaining.

What I like about the series is it has a little of that ""Star Wars"" and new ""Battlestar Galactica"" type of feel to it. That being said, the series is quite complex and it may take several views to comprehend the storyline.

There are a lot of characters that appear on the first episode and almost similar to Sci-Fi hit series ""Battlestar Galactica"", you have that complexity and you are introduced to many characters on both sides and it may be confusing at first, but once you get into further episodes in the series, everything starts to flesh out.

For ""Xenosaga"", the same situation and by the third episode, you get a clearer picture of what's going on and in this case, because so much happens within the Woglinde and then the ambush from Gnosis, characters are quickly whittled down but the main characters still remain.

As for the animation, this may or may not be a deal breaker for the video game fans who were so involved with the 3D characters of the video game series. I found the video game series beautiful, I found the animation pretty good but nothing awespiring.

My personal feeling is that with a storyline so complex and so many people and so many intricacies of science fiction, definitely would make it difficult for creators to have so much completed before airing on TV Asahi.

To tell you the truth, as an avid Japanese RPG gamer, I tend to say that the graphics are not as important to an RPG game, it's the storyline and the overall gameplay.

So, for an anime series based on an RPG, I would probably like to see more focus on the storyline than the animation. Because of the complexities and the fact its based on an RPG, perhaps its why I'm so lenient when it came to the animation.

As for the voice work, I didn't compare the voice work to the video game series but listening to both Japanese and English dubs, I found both to work quite well with the characters.

As for special features, surprisingly only the clean opening and ending animation. So, no commentary folks.

Now, can someone who hasn't played the video game be into ""Xenosaga"" the anime series?

In my opinion, if you are looking for a sci-fi anime, then yes. Gamer or not a gamer, it really doesn't matter. What if comes down to is if you enjoy an in-depth sci-fi anime series.

Because the storyline is a bit complex, it's very hard to give ""Xenosaga"" a must-see recommend without watching the whole series completely and seeing if it's worth the time to invest.

For me, because I enjoy the video game series and I enjoy sci-fi anime, I was pretty stoked to finally get a chance to watch ""Xenosaga"" the anime series.

The first four episodes are merely introduction of the characters and you have a sense that hell is going to break loose in future episodes.

But so far you are left with tidbits of information that drags you into wanting to see how the puzzle piece fits. Of course, not entirely cerebral in a ""Ghost in a Shell"" manner but I'm definitely interested to see where the storyline goes from the second volume on.

So, the best thing I can say right now is that if you are into complex sci-fi anime series or a fan of a sci-fi series such as ""Battlestar Galactica"", then there is a good chance that ""Xenosaga"" is one adventure that you don't want to miss.",1218153600,,4790,4.608235294117647
8207772,5,B000T4T91S,"Hello, this review on my copy of, Xenosaga Vol. 1: Enter the Gnosis. After watching this DVD, i found that it was outstanding. I am also the owner of two of the Xenosaga games for the PS2. The story follows that of the games plot. If you have played or seen the game, you can guess where it will lead. The artwork is of a good quality standard, and the voice casting is acceptable. I wish they could have used the voices from the actual game, which would have made it more enjoyable. Nice amount of bonus features. Over all i give this full marks.

I am looking forward in the next volume in this series. If you loved the game this is a must have anime.",1205193600,2,653,4.141732283464567
8207773,5,B000T4T91S,"This is a different version of the story told in Xenosaga Episode I: Will to Power.  However, the main characters and the central plot basically follow the same course.  This is a nice collector's item to have for any fan of the Xenosaga series.  If you have a friend or a family member who would like to watch the story but do not have the time to play the game, then this is the answer.  Also for someone who might have tried to play the game but was unable to finish it, this series of anime DVDs could be the way to go.

Personally, I prefer the story that was told in the video game.  The soundtrack to the video game, composed by the renowned Yasunori Mitsuda, was also better than the soundtrack here.  However, this anime does fill in some of the information left out in the game.  As I said, there are some deviations between the two, as far as the plot goes.  In the anime, Lt. Virgil did not die until near the end of the episode.  Whereas he died rather early in the game.  There are enough deviations here to make it feel like you're watching a different plot unfold.  Enough to entertain you all over again, even if you've played the game numerous time, as I have.

I've always felt that the Xenosaga series of video games told one heck of a great story.  The gameplay, graphics, voice-acting, and soundtrack were also top-notch.  I just hope that one day, a novel of the series will come out.  And eventually even a live-action movie.  But for now, we will have to be content with this anime.",1198022400,7,1507,4.325
8207774,5,B000T4T91S,"Envision a collaboration among Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey), George Lucas (Star Wars), and Gene Roddenberry (Star Trek).  Add in a pinch of Ridley Scott (Alien), and you have Xenosaga.  This epic animation delivers a nice twist to the Xenosaga Episode I:  Der Wille Zur Macht video game storyline.  Fans of science fiction will enjoy the futuristic action and philosophy.  Anime fans won't be disappointed in the smooth, clear quality of the audiovisuals.  Finally, fans of the videogame series will appreciate a slightly different take and clarification on the story.  They owe it to themselves to check this out.  Vol. 1 is a rollercoaster ride ending cliffhanger that captures the essence of the saga.  It will have you counting down to the release of Vol. 2.",1191283200,7,773,5.0236220472440944
8207775,5,B000T4T91S,"This is Xenosaga how EVERYONE can enjoy it! Quick and to the point but not rushed. The voices sound great and everything looks great.

The fight sceens have more blood than the third game, the baddies (Like Albedo) sound so cruel and have such wicked diologue it will make your jaw DROP in a good way! Virgil sounds great, and KOS-MOS is doing fantastic as well!

The story is modified a bit from the original, and a bit more interesting if you ask me (I've seen the whole thing in Japanese).

I love it so much so far, I haven't enjoyed an anime this much for a while, get it DEFINATELY! ;D",1190073600,6,591,4.258928571428571
