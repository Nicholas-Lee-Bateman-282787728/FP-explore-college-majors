8209141,3,B000TGKWZ8,I absolutely love every movie in this collection! They are all groundbreakers/classics in their own right. The reason for the 3 stars is the quality of the recordings is atrocious!! It is as though they are bootleg copies; some scenes dark with poor clarity of color. Really quite awful!!,1494028800,,288,4.8979591836734695
8209142,2,B000TGKWZ8,"I was really looking forward to viewing ""One Eyed Jacks"" which I consider one of the best Western movies ever made. I was very disappointed when I saw how poor the video quality was of this DVD. Maybe they tried to put too many movies on one disc? Anyway, save your money and buy ""One Eyed Jacks"" somewhere else.",1275436800,4,312,4.305084745762712
