8153222,3,B000JU8H7O,"some really good actors yet story felt like it didn't care and didn't push much. kind of a lazy approach. a bit to relaxed at times. a slow flik is a nice thing most the time, yet this one had some fast moments and then sort of yawns and trails off. pacing, acting, sticking to a story it all just felt like they ran out of ideas more than tried to show every day people and everyday life affected by sudden trauma.",1461369600,,415,4.073170731707317
8153223,3,B000JU8H7O,"After a shooting incident on a bus, three survivors meet again.  The world's worst policeman teams up with the world's worst toilet cleaner to run a ""Revenge"" agency out of a dirty toilet stall. The third person involved is a one-eyed pharmacist who hates the world (Chiaki Kuriyama- Gogo in ""Kill Bill"").
