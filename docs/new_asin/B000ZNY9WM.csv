8236136,5,B000ZNY9WM,Living in the Florida Keys suggest a heavy duty air conditioner but at Christmas time a big fireplace during my Christmas Boat Parade Party was a huge hit and everyone wanted one....lol.  Thanks for being so inventive!,1369526400,,218,4.891891891891892
8236137,3,B000ZNY9WM,"Nice dvd, but does anyone know how to clear out the little video icon in the top right corner?  Looks like an old reel projector.  I've tried all of the buttons on my remote, but it still stays and detracts from the fireplace scene.",1279238400,,232,4.25
8236138,3,B000ZNY9WM,"I picked up this DVD for $3 at my local CVS drug store. I wasn't expecting much, but I wanted something to use as background during the holidays. I was very pleasantly surprised at the several viewing/audio options offered on a budget label DVD and even more impressed by the quality of the musical offerings. The selections by the St. James Harp Quartet are stunning!

BUY THIS FOR THE MUSIC ALONE and you will not be disappointed. The fireplace views are an added value that just happens to compliment the music.

RECOMMENDED!",1261008000,,528,4.728260869565218
