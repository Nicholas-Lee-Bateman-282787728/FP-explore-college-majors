1431903,4,B00005JHBA,"Really, this is a movie that I have a split reaction to.  Taken simply as it comes, it's a satisfactory film, but under deeper analysis, some cracks begin to show in the foundation.
Simply as entertainment, The Caveman's Valentine is more than satisfactory.  The film delivers an interesting sort of detective story with interesting and engaging imagery and cinematography.  The plot twist near the end, while not Sixth Sense level, certainly wasn't what I had been expecting, and after the movie, you're first thought will probably be, ""Well, that was pretty good.""
On a deeper level, however, there are some inconsistencies with this film.  My first, biggest complaint would be some of the unnecessary plot devices introduced early on in the film.  This is an adaptation from a book, and while I can't say that I've read the original by Dawes, I'd bet that the tower and its mysterious owner played a larger part in the book than they do in the movie.  As the film stands, there's a lot of information concerning Romulus's (Jackson's character) early life that has no relevance later on.
It seems as though the film's cinematographer was a little too absorbed in the creation of a fantastic atmosphere for my taste as well.  Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent film to look at.  The problem is that the cinematography is occasionally allowed to get in the way of plot development and the telling of the story.  Now, I realize that there's a lot of symbolism contained here and that the director and writer have a point to make about the mentally unstable, but there's a point at which you have to realize that what you're doing is costing more than it's worth.
Of course, all of these realizations are ones that you would make after you finished viewing the film, not during the movie, which means that they don't truly impact the film as it is viewed.  The audience's suspension of disbelief is held fairly consistently throughout, and the viewer can truly identify with Romulus, so I suppose some belated misgivings can be forgiven.
The bonus materials are better than average, but still not the best.  Particularly annoying was the presentation of the deleted scenes.  Now, I always end up watching all of them anyway, but it's much clearer to present them separately, rather than as a single piece, as is the case here.  I've always particularly admired Shyamalan's approach in the Sixth Sense, with his expanded elaboration as to why the scenes were removed in the first place.  In one case, this is evident with this film (the moth-Seraph scene would just have been confusing), but in other cases the scenes which were deleted might have made the movie easier to understand.
All things considered, The Caveman's Valentine is worth 5 stars immediately after you see it and 3 stars on later consideration, so I took the average.  This is a movie that you could probably enjoy for a long time to come, especially if you like the fantastic imagery and cinematography, so I feel safe in recommending this to any interested audience.",998092800,,3040,4.8080614203454894
1431904,5,B00005JHBA,"Much has been said about Jackson's bravura performance.  The tight writing and surprising plot twists which frequently caught me flat-footed also delighted me.  What I wish to comment on here, though is possibly the best cinematography I have ever seen.  Highly surreal and often beautiful still photos and video intertwine gracefully in as high an expression of the film makers visual art as you will ever see.  Sometime it is footage that seems to be from the Harlem Renassaince, other times it is a simple black and white still photo or a close in shot of a part of the human anatomy.  The effect is stunning.  Not for all tastes with its truley evil crimes, but for the film buff this is absolutely essential.  ....",998092800,,719,4.704
1431905,2,B00005JHBA,"After watching ""Caveman's Valentine"", I realize that Samuel L. Jackson is an amazing actor. I have to give credit where credit is due. He tried so hard to make his character believable, but it didn't work. Granted, it wasn't his fault. He did the best he could with a weak role. The script didn't exactly help him out one bit and the pace was slower than it had to be. I hated everytime he would go into one of his ""crazy spells"" and see lights and other things that were not there. Everything had a believability factor of ZERO. This is one of those movies where you don't really root for the ""bad guy"" or the ""good guy""; you don't root for anyone. By the time the movie was over, I didn't care for him or any of the other characters. I just wanted it to end.",997833600,2,760,4.1768707482993195
1431906,4,B00005JHBA,"Rather than simply make a continuation of her debut feature, EVE'S BAYOU, Kasi Lemmons wisely chose to ""stretch her creative muscles"" with her next effort. While not entirely successful, THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE is nevertheless an intelligent and provocative film.
Based on the novel by George Dawes Green (who also wrote the screenplay), THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE tells the story of Romulus Ledbetter (played effectively by Samuel L. Jackson), a mentally ill cave-dwelling man. One day, he discovers a dead body just outside his living space, causing him to immediately embark on a search to find the killer.
It doesn't take long before you realize that you are not watching a run-of-the-mill murder mystery. Instead of bombarding you with pointless car chases and noisy special effects, THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE focuses on the demons inside Ledbetter's mind. This is represented through a series of highly stylized hallucinations and flashbacks.
The film also explores the strained relationship between Ledbetter and his daughter, Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis of MEN OF HONOR). Their situation is further exacerbated by the fact that Lulu is a cop involved in the murder investigation. Simply put, there is no shortage of character conflict nor eye candy here.
The dialog also crackles in the film. The best line is spoken by Tamara Tunie (the narrator on EVE'S BAYOU), who plays the role of Sheila, Lulu's mother. Written by an (uncredited) Lemmons, the line is sure to elicit a response from fans of Terry McMillan and similar novelists.
Overall, THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE is an intriguing character study which includes a touching father-daughter relationship. This comes at the expense of gripping ""edge of your seat"" suspense, but don't let this keep you from experiencing this rich and complex film. Amelia Vincent's cinematography and Terilyn A. Shropshire's editing are first-rate. Terence Blanchard's score is seamless. (These three also collaborated with Lemmons on EVE'S BAYOU.)
If you're a fan of typical summer movies that seem to care more about style over substance, you'll probably be better off to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you've grown weary of loud thrillers with formulaic plots, you'll really appreciate this film. Check it out.",997747200,,2249,5.320224719101123
1431907,4,B00005JHBA,"The thin line between genius and insanity is examined in this story of a gifted man estranged from his family and separated from his vocation by his seemingly unfounded paranoia.  ""The Caveman's Valentine,"" directed by Kasi Lemmons, stars Samuel L. Jackson as Romulus Ledbetter, a former Julliard student, talented composer and pianist who now lives in a cave near a park in New York City.  Romulus treads that delicate line between reality and fantasy, his thought process interrupted by the ""moth seraphs"" that live within his head, but even during his most rational periods the demons of his delusions plague him incessantly.  He alternately recoils from and stands boldly upright against the presence of the towering skyscraper (the Chrysler Building) wherein resides the ""Big Brother"" of his imagination, the man responsible for his present state of being, a man named ""Stiverson.""  But then again, is it really only in his imagination?
 In his cave, Romulus has an unconnected television set he watches, which keeps him abreast of the latest ""lies"" concocted by those in power and foisted on an unsuspecting public.  He lives alone, but is well known on the streets for his vociferous ranting and railings against Stiverson and those who seek to subjugate those like himself, those who haven't the strength or the power to stand up to them.  Then one day, in the dead of winter, Romulus emerges one morning from his cave and finds something in a tree just outside.  And what he finds sets him upon a quest that will prove to everyone once and for all that he is not crazy, that Stiverson and the others exist and are what he says they are, and if he is successful, he will finally have the proof.  Now if he can but stave off his demons and maintain lucidity long enough to do what he must do; he is adamant, but just as he is beginning, ""they"" introduce their newest weapon which they wield in a soft, green light, the ""Z-Rays.""  Romulus, however, is frightened but not deterred, and more determined than ever to expose Stiverson for what he is.
 Kasi Lemmons, who made an auspicious directorial debut in 1997 with ""Eve's Bayou,"" presents this complex story with a stylistic and artistic touch that at times evokes the spirit of Fellini (as with the ""moth seraphs"" sequences which she uses to great effect).  She quickly establishes the character of Romulus and sets a pace that allows the mystery to escalate as the story unfolds.  Her approach succinctly captures the paranoid world inhabited by Romulus in his own mind, and she plays on his sudden erratic behavior and the unexpected turn in the middle of a scene to build an underlying tension that makes the drama all the more riveting.  Most importantly, she manages to go beyond what is happening in the film to convey the true essence of what this story is all about, with insight and an obvious and incisive grasp of human nature.
 Samuel L. Jackson gives a dynamic performance as Romulus, who has a tendency to lapse into quiet moments, but guards against them as if they were a threat to his safety.  Afraid to let his guard down, he fights his fears with anger and bravura, but clearly that's not who this man really is, which Jackson communicates quite effectively.  There's nothing feigned or pretentious about this character, and Jackson takes him from a rational moment into madness seamlessly, which adds to the credibility of not only Romulus, but the entire film.  This is not a man to whom you will be able to relate directly, but there are certainly elements of his situation to which you will readily be able to sympathize.  Romulus is a thoroughly complex character, and Jackson realizes those complexities with insight and realism.
 Also outstanding in one of the smaller, but pivotal supporting roles in Anthony Michael Hall as Bob, the bankruptcy lawyer who encounters Romulus and somewhat indirectly facilitates his mission.  Hall has matured as an actor, and this is probably one of the best roles he's had since his youthful efforts in such films as ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""  Ann Magnuson also gives a noteworthy performance as Moria Leppenraub, the sister of artist David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), who is something of a free spirit and becomes involved with Romulus when certain circumstances lead him to David.  Magnuson has a certain charismatic, Shirley MacLaine-like quality about her that makes her accessible and easy to watch, and she is very believable here as Moria.
 Rounding out the supporting cast are Tamara Tunie (Shelia), Damir Andrei (Arnold), Aunjanue Ellis (Lulu), Peter MacNeill (Cork), Jay Rodan (Joey), Rodney Eastman (Matthew) and Kate McNeil (Betty).  A thought provoking, emotionally involving film that is exceptionally well presented and acted, ""The Caveman's Valentine"" has something to say about the diversity of a society in which everyone has a place, no matter what they may appear to be, and the fact that absolutely no one should ever be dismissed out-of-hand.  It says that there are no ""throw-away"" people; that the value of an individual often cannot be measured until confronted with extraordinary circumstances, for it is that which brings out the best and drives someone like Romulus to exercise the latent capacity which lies within.  One of life's lessons, told here with a profound clarity by Lemmons, through a medium that is the magic of the movies.",996537600,2,5411,4.937155457552371
1431908,4,B00005JHBA,"""The Caveman's Valentine"" was received by the critics with mixed reviews.  I think it deserves better.  In a world of ""knock-off"" thrillers, this is a truly original film.  Admittedly, it is slow-moving at times and the ending doesn't really work, but all that can be forgiven in light of Samuel L. Jackson's magnificent performance.
Jackson plays Romulus Ledbetter, a mentally ill man who lives in a cave in a New York City park.  He is not truly homeless, since he has his cave, but he does have some bizarre beliefs.  He is convinced that a monstrous man named Stuyvestant is orchestrating a conspiracy against him and the other poor and disenfranchised people of the world from atop the Empire State Building.  We see strange colored lights flood the screen as Jackson experiences Stuyvestant zapping him throughout the film with strange ""Y rays"" and ""Z rays"" that mess with his mind.
But Jackson is not just a run-of-the-mill crazy.  He is a musical genius who used to teach at Julliard.  His reputation gives him a temporary entry into high society where he must cope with his schizophrenic symptoms while trying to solve a murder.  Someone has murdered a young man and left him right outside Jackson's cave.  Or did the young man just freeze to death?  When a homeless drug addict tells Jackson that a high-society photographer, famed for his sadomasochistic photographs of young men, killed the boy, Jackson takes this personally.  His schizophrenic rage is temporarily channeled into an overriding quest: to nail the killer.  It helps that Jackson has a daughter who works for the police department.  But will anybody believe him?
The movie winds down to a dizzying surprise conclusion worthy of Agatha Christie.  The ending is not handled well, however, and it is really the film's weak point.  The high points are Jackson's great performance as a schizophrenic man; the special effects that show us what he sees; and the boldly original themes explored in the plot.",996451200,,1976,4.942424242424242

The DTS audio track sounded fantastic and was just perfect in the scenes where Jackson's character plays piano.

I'm not sure how this came out in 2001 yet nobody seems to have heard of it, or why it only has 5 stars on IMDB. But Jackson's performance in this movie is probably his most different than any of his other films, and probably one of his best.

The story is very original, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. A homeless schizophrenic tries to solve a murder mystery and rubs elbows with New York's artist elite. It really presents a great insight into a the mind of a schizophrenic.

It keeps faithful to the concept and doesn't 'cop out' at the end how so many other films who take on the schizophrenic idea like 'he imagined the whole thing' or 'the killer is really him!' which Hollywood would normally do in this case.

1431948,4,B00005JHBA,"Romulus Ledbetter: ""Swarms of moth-seraphs howl in my skull. Lies vex them.""

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Paranoid schizophrenic Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) lives in a cave in New York's Inwood Park.
2. He believes that the root of all evil dwells at the top of the Chrysler Building, emitting rays that control the world.
3. He has a host of moth-like angels swarming in his head.
4.  The dead body frozen in a tree outside his cave is no hallucination
5. Gripping but highly improbable plot follows, as Ledbetter searches for answers.

This is one of Jackson's finest performances, in an over-looked murder/fantasy movie that lacks a great plot, but makes up for it with great acting and vivid imagery.

If you can ignore the impossible and unlikely bits, this is a good rental for fans of the unusual.

1431971,5,B00005JHBA,"""The Caveman's Valentine"" like other movies of this genre (""The Fisher King"" and ""Powder"") speaks to humanity's collective unconscious more powerfully than any of us can ever know, or even admit to if we did know. We are all so focused on this one lifetime, this one living space we call the world, our reality. But I believe there are those who remember other lifetimes lived in other dimensions and worlds in the universe; places, even earths, far older than this one.  All too often, those memories, necessarily, return, shocking and so overwhelming the systems of those who do remember, that their exhumed, authentic sanity is catapulted into overdrive and the result is a brilliantly strange, supremely talented individual who can no longer co-exist with the delusional condition we call ""civilization"" because its very nature and the bylaws of that nature are a collective, unequivocal denial of what the Caveman (or Cavewoman) lives with everyday. This is because, by comparison, the tenets of the ""regulated"" insanity of our so-called ""civilization"" won't allow him to believe what he feels, dreams, or sees in myriad visions.

Society's cavemen and cavewomen are enormously frightening because they tap into our own ""blocked"" memories, and to try to believe them, even a little bit, is too much. So, we immediately label them ""insane"" because we hope that to do so will keep us from ever having to face what I think is a reality common to all of us, a place of secrets, and perhaps a shame that is  older than time. For, why else would we, since the beginning of known time, torture ourselves with so much betrayal, violence, and suffering?

So, the Caveman's ""insanity"" grows not from some chemical secretion or refusal to deal with reality, but from the overwhelming power of the denial of an extraordinary, but true reality, which, to our shuttered minds is the stuff of lore and forbidden fantasy; a real-life fantasy which is impossible to prove to a world where the history of our souls and their creation has become the warp and woof of religion and legend, finding no real outlet except in the babblings of the ""insane"" or the ""possessed.""  You may ask: What is the entire unabridged story? Well, for now, we've hidden that in the depths of our unconscious, where it lies ""forgotten,"" until someone like the Caveman pokes a teasing finger and scares us into almost remembering. The story shall, I fear, remain ""forgotten,"" until we can somehow resolve the often horrible  contradictions of our pasts, and forgive ourselves both collectively and individually. Then perhaps, insanity will simply cease to exist. We will go home to the Caveman, the prodigals, whose acceptance of him, and his of us, finally brings the wholeness we have sought, and have shedded more than blood to find.

""The Caveman's Valentine"" is not for everybody. But for those of us who believe in far more than we can actually see, this movie is a validation of that part of us, of those shadowy dreams and nightmares we wake from, frightened, not of their strangeness, but of their familiarity; not of their impossibility, but of their undeniable validity.",1209600000,,3145,4.933837429111531
1431972,3,B00005JHBA,"I have seen this film many times over the years and my opinion of it hasn't changed much.  Kasi Lemmons is a very interesting director, she has a nice visual flair as evidenced also with Eve's Bayou, she seems to have incorporated elements of Black Theatre into this piece with the Moth Seraphs and their dances.

Samuel L. Jackson is completely at his best, and once again shows why he is a huge mainstream movie star.  His portrayal of Romulus Ledbetter is very much Sam Jack, but he does some amazing things with this character with such small nuances as his disoriented walk much like what Ralph Fiennes did in Cronenberg's Spider (for those who have seen that), in fact this is the kind of story I could see David Cronenberg tackling, but alas this film suffers from what I call a conventional ending, and has too many cliche plot twists for me that in the end it almost comes off as an above average prime time television show along the lines of CSI or even a made-for-television film.

I do recommend seeing this for Lemmons direction, and Jackson's awesome performance.  Any young actor can learn a thing or two.

1431977,5,B00005JHBA,"The title of the movie sounds puerile enough. Who and what is a caveman's Valentine, anyway? However, this movie is anything but facetious or shallow. Astounding in its depth and the manner in which it treats certain subjects with sensitivity, I would describe this movie, which is based on a novel of the same name by George Dawes Green, as nothing short of genius.
Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) is a schizophrenic former musician who renounced middle-class life to live in a rocky enclosure in Manhattan's Inwood Park. One cold Valentine's Day, driven by voices and subliminal messages he finds on his TV set (That's the surreal bit: He gets to watch TV even though there's nothing in the cave for it to be plugged into), he ventures outside to find the dead body of 20-year-old Scotty Gales. Romulus believes this to be the work of an omniscient and evil mastermind by the name of Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant who happens to live in the Chrysler Building.
Romulus believes it to be his moral and divine duty to track down the murderer of Scotty Gales and thus his adventure begins.
We the audience are offered glimpses into the former life of Romulus; his musical education at Juilliard, his wife, his daughter now grown up and with the police force, and his decline into insanity. This movie deals sensitively with the issue of homelessness, mental illness and the emotional turmoil that families of the mentally ill go through. Romulus' family is torn between helping him and rejecting him for his non-acceptance of their lifestyle, values and middle-class sensibilities.
We catch glimpses too of Romulus' version of reality; of the voices and visions that haunt him, of the moth-seraphs that dwell in his head, of the manifestation of his wife, also his Muse, each time he sits before a piano and quakes. We see, in two scenes, his musical genius and his emotional involvement with his music.
As the plot thickens, we see that the main suspect is not the enigmatic Stuyvesant but an artist named David Leppenraub, who had used Scotty Gates as a nude model on several occasions. Romulus seeks to entrap and expose Leppenraub as the killer, but matters are not as simple as one thinks.
`The Caveman's Valentine' is a detective drama, a psychological thriller and a character study all rolled into one, and brought to a state of high polish by the efforts of Samuel L. Jackson and Kasi Lemmons.
No one could have made Romulus Ledbetter as real and alive as Samuel L. Jackson did. For his performance alone, I would rate the movie 5 stars out of 5. And Miss Kasi Lemmons? I'd give her a standing ovation for outstanding directorial work.",1065052800,5,2645,4.802631578947368

I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed.  This film tried to give the impression that it was saying a great deal, when in reality it said nothing.  Its overuse of intensely graphic imagery simply tried to hide a very weak story.  It struck me as a movie that would win raves at a film festival or a film school, drawing descriptions such as ""how deep!"" or ""it's multi-layered"" from people who felt that this was the right thing to say.  Unfortunately, I'm neither a film student nor was I at a festival.  I simply wanted to enjoy a movie.  My biggest regret is not giving up hope on the movie.  I kept convincing myself that I should stick with it because there had to be a satisfying ending.  There wasn't.  This movie, unfortunately, feels very long and to me was a total disappointment.

1431980,3,B00005JHBA,"Director Kasi Lemmons has been long known as an actress whose works include superb ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and eerie ""Candyman.""  But where was she?  If you can immediately remember her roles in them, you got a splendid memory.  Well, try to find the heroines' (Jodie Forster and Virginia Madsen) collegue and friend.  Check it out if you're not busy because you're surprised to know that both roles are comparatively big.
But in the future her name will be remembered as that of a director, and a pretty good one at that.  Her debut ""Eve's Bayou"" in 1997 was deservedly praised for its original storytelling and Gothic atomosphere that are based on the mythic locales of the Deep South.  And that film was supported by strong performance from Samuel L. Jackson, again starring in ""The Caveman's Valentine.""
As the second feature film, Ms. Lemmons moved her film's background to New York, and again brings back Sam Jackson's bravura performance as ""Caveman,"" who, though he was once a skillful piano player and even attended prestigeous Julliard, is now living alone in a small ""cave"" in a park of the city, haunted by an illusion that someone is watching him from the top of the Chrysler Building.  But when he found a dead frozen body up on a tree, he notices that there is some REAL plot going on.  He claims that he alone can see that secret.  But how can he convince the others of his theory, when people around him including his own daughter are not willing to trust him and his mind?
The strength of the film lies in, not surprisingly, Jackson's powerhouse performance as Caveman, who is certainly tormented by his visions, or in his words, 'brain storm.""  Thanks to his acting, the original story that sometimes too incredible to be true can hide its holes, making us suspend our disbelief even though for a while.  You know, today, in New York, who would care to speak to, or let in your condo, the guy who raves incredible things on the street, and moreover give your fancy clothes?  But it's Sam Jackson, and we know he would succeed anyway.
But his strong acting sometimes backfires.  The supporting cast are comparatively weak, and about the thriller part of the film gives too little attention simply because we are always sort of forced to see things all through Caveman, watching Jackson's forceful acting maybe too much.  And his theory of murder, itself a shaky one, is made more so owing to the lack of logics, and to make matters more confusing, Kasi Lemmons, unlike her excellent previous work, uses too many imageries (including CGI images) to emphasize the potential madness of Caveman.  The story itself is more than simply disturbing -- it is disrupted often by its own power, which should have been more restrained as she did in ""Eve's Bayou.""
Overall a satisfactory entry from this promising director, ""The Caveman's Valentine"" is a very ambitious one, too.  I may be allowed to say that it is too ambitious for its own sake, being set in modern city of New York, taking the delicate issue of mind, and connecting it to a neo-noir thriller.  Probably you either like it, or ignore it.  Either way, if you love to see Samuel L. Jackson doing what he can -- not being rendered to a digital pixel as in the new ""Star Wars"" trilogy -- this will offer you what you need.",1026172800,3,3295,4.651724137931034
1431981,3,B00005JHBA,"While I genuinely appreciated the fact that a homeless and mentally ill person was the focus of this movie (a risky and brave move for a director to make), I have to say that this movie did not seem completely believable to me. For one thing, the hero of this movie, Romulus Ledbetter, has severe paranoid schizophrenia and severe hallucinations...and yet he is able to figure out the complexities of a murder, separating truth from fiction. I wondered how he did this when his hallucinations seemed so real and believable. How did he figure out what was truth and what were only the products of his tortured imagination?
 Ledbetter's hallucinations are the other problem with this movie...they are so pervasive that they make the movie chaotic and confusing at times.
 If the mystery and suspense were as dramatic and intense as Ledbetter's fantasy world, the movie might have had more impact. Instead, it focuses mostly on his illness, with a lackluster mystery added to the mix. Samuel Jackson gives the role his all but the script leaves something to be desired. In comparison, I found a movie with a similar focus, The Prince of Central Park, to be far more watchable. Kudos to the director of The Caveman's Valentine, however, for attempting to show a mentally ill person as someone worthy of respect and dignity.",1023408000,5,1319,4.857777777777778

Jackson turns in an endearing performance as the schizoid, homeless genius who nevertheless solves a murder mystery. Bongwater's Ann Magnuson shows up in a supporting role. Ignore the cranks, this is a good night of entertainment.",1019174400,3,340,4.982456140350878
1431983,3,B00005JHBA,"In terms of visual style, this film is like ""The Watcher"" which also used creative visual shots. I also enjoyed seeing the juxtaposition of the dark well-toned angels with the white vulnerable angels portrayed by the sinister photographer.
The plot.  The one character I didn't quite have a handle on was Anthony Michael Hall's lawyer character.  Was he mocking the eccentric homeless man he encounters on the street or did he truly have an admiration for him?  The photographer's sister- would she really get intimately involved with a homeless man she had only met hours before?
The acting-  At first, I didn't think the acting of Romulus' daughter was that strong until her scene when her father asked her for a ride.  Then, it seemed as if the emotions of a daughter sadly disappointed that the beloved father was lost not to death or to abandonment but to mental illness truly came out.  The ex-wife in the form of Romulus' vision was as stunning on screen as he was.  Even though in real time she had given up on him, she portrayed a protectiveness in his visions.
... The composer has worked on at least one of Spike Lee's film.  The prime example is in the scene where Romulus gets a chance to showcase his skill. The music perfectly keeps us guessing whether his performance was real- or all just in his head.
Neither a perfect human drama or mystery, it does, however, more accurately portray schizophrenia than any other movie I've seen before this.  Only people who are not familiar with the mentally ill would say that Romulus' portrayal are unrealistic.",1018137600,2,1567,4.731617647058823
1431984,4,B00005JHBA,"Ms. Lemmons who also gifted us with the fabulous ""Eve's Bayou"" works her magic once more with ""The Caveman's Valentine,"" a film about a cave-dwelling paranoid schizophrenic and his attempts to solve a murder mystery. First, I have to say that I just love Samuel L. Jackson for his convincing portrayals. Though he is good at whatever role he takes on, I especially like to see him breathe life into odd characters like this one and the psychotic villain he portrayed in ""Unbreakable.""
This is a very dark and somber looking film that really gives you the feel of what it must be like to be on the streets of New York City. Jackson, outfitted with flowing grey locks and layers of rags definitely looks the part of a homeless person and through cut-aways we are given a view into what happens inside his brain -- his nagging ex wife and his conversations with his nemesis Stuyvesant. Though our protanganist Romulus Ledbetter is a brilliant, classically-trained pianist, he suffers from mental illness. He does have periods of lucidity and it is during these times that he is able to convince people to help him as he tries to get to the bottom of a crime. Sure there are some unrealisitic developments in the film, but they do serve to move the plot along. After all, this is a dramatization, so the director should be allowed some creative license.
A smarmy wealthy man befriends Ledbetter and provides him with a place to bathe and a set of decent clothes, allowing him some semblance of normalcy. This sets the climax of the film in motion as Ledbetter charms his way into the home of the person he suspects is responsible for the death of the young man left outside his cave on Valentine's Day. There is great scene at the suspect's house where we see Ledbetter at the piano playing like his he is communing with the instrument, however, I have not quite figured out if he really delievered a virtuoso performance or whether he just imagines that he does.
There is an interesting family dynamic in this movie as we see Ledbetter's long-suffering daughter trying to deal with her father. On the one hand, she does know that he is mentally-ill and prone to delusions, on the other hand, she wants to believe his fantastic theory about the unsolved mystery.
Samuel L. Jackson delivered a great performance here, and it's a shame that this film didn't receive more recognition.",1016064000,2,2377,4.688995215311005
1431985,4,B00005JHBA,"The Caveman's Valentine (Kasi Lemmons, 2001)

Lemmons, who gave us the well-above-average Eve's Bayou a few years back, helms George Dawes Green's adaptation of his own award-winning debut novel about a schizophrenic pianist, Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson), who wakes up one morning, walks out of his New York cave (yes, they do still have caves in New York, at least if you believe Green, and homeless people live in them), and discovers a frozen body in a tree. This may not be anything other than par for the course in winter in new York, but Ledbetter is convinced that the man's death is anything other than natural. Of course, Ledbetter is also convinced that the Chrysler building is inhabited by an evil overlord named Cornelius Beford Stuyvesant (groove on the name for a few minutes, if you're acquainted with the early history of NYC) who's out to kill him. So no one, least of all his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s love interest in Men of Honor), wants to take him seriously. But Lulu, an NYC police officer, is a subordinate of the guy who ends up running the case. What's a girl to do? Add to this the fact that the dead guy's boyfriend, Matt (Rodney Eastman, of many indie films and a copule of Nightmare on Elm Street flicks-- he played Joey, the mute guy), DOES believe Ledbetter, and provides him with the name of the killer, interntionally-renowned photographer David Leppenraub (Colm Feore, who's been in most every movie made in the past decade). Ledbetter starts digging around to see whether there's a murder here to investigate, and, as we all know, complications ensue.

The movie is cast perfectly, from Jackson all the way down to the relatively minor part played by an almost unrecognizable Anthony Michael Hall (who really does deserve a lot more high-profile roles; the guy is just plain good). The script is well-done and moves along at a proper pace, never letting the action drop even when exploring its various subplots. Okay, Leppenraub is a little too obviously modeled on Mapplethorpe, but we'll forgive Green since the rest of it's so well-done. But the key to the whole performance is Jackson himself, who gives a career-best performance as Ledbetter. Schizophrenia may never have been filmed as well as it is here. Rather than go for the Hollywood-style nutcase one normally associates with filmed depictions of schizophrenia, Lemmons and Jackson take the DSM-IIIR route and hand us a character who's, ironically, not as believable unless you've read a whole lot of scizophrenia case studies. Then you realize just how perfect a depiction this is, and your jaw hits the floor, both at Jackson's wonderful performance and the fact that Hollywood let this movie slip through the cracks.

Very much worth going well out of your way to see, especially if you like Sam Jackson. Lots of interest from indie circles, too, as many indie-film darlings show up here. Hard to believe this movie got almost no press given the cast, but so it happened. Very highly recommended. ****",1007510400,17,3036,4.87984496124031
1431986,2,B00005JHBA,"The Caveman's Valentine was one of the weirdest, strangest, and confusing films I have ever seen.  I knew one minute into this movie that I was going to regret paying the $3.69(which is a rip-off in itself) at Blockbuster that I did.
Frankly, I didn't really know what was going on throughout the whole movie.  There are things that I have mulled over after watching it, and I still don't have a clue what they meant.  I know the color green was a significant part of the movie, but why?  The director did not explain this to me.  And if he did, then it was in some kind of subliminal message.
And why people are calling this movie a visual stunner is beyond me.  There was nothing great about the Cinematography in my opinion.  And that is basically the only reason I rented this movie.  That and Samuel L. Jackson is in it.
The Caveman's Valentine is everything that I expected in the form of craziness and oddness, but it failed in my eyes in the directing department and the overall writing of the story.  2 Stars",1007251200,4,1017,4.39572192513369
1431987,3,B00005JHBA,"Movie Summary: Romulus Ledbetter is a genius and a master pianist. He went to school at Juliard, has a wife and daughter and lives in a cave in Central Park. Romulus you see suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. He has demons in his head that drive him into fits of rage. On Valentines day upon emerging from his cave, Romulus finds a frozen body in a tree. He considers this his valentine and takes it upon himself to find out who killed the young man. Romulus fights his demons and once again enters the normal word to find the person who left him such a valentine.

My Opinion:  It's no mystery that Samuel L. Jackson gives a great performance in this film. If you are a fan of his, then it's worth seeing just for that. Aside from that, this movie is basically a ""made for TV"" type drama. That's not necessarily bad, many of those can be very gripping and entertaining and TCV is both of those. It does require a lot of suspension of belief though. The story takes place in the ""real world"" and thus must follow those rules. The way Romulus reenters society after living in a cave for so long is a stretch. He finds a guy on the street who happens to invite him to his home and presto he's got a suit of clothes and looks normal again. This doesn't really ruin the movie, but it's there. What does bring the movie to a screeching halt though is one of the last scene cuts. This one snaps your head so badly that you will have whiplash well after the credits are over. Out of nowhere Romulus follows another character onto a train and the movie comes to its climax. There is no set up or explanation and you are left wondering what the heck happened. Not even the deleted scenes shed any light on this one. For me this cut one star off my rating and made me feel like the movie cut short. It deserved a better ending than it got.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 with good video quality.  Sound: DD 5.1 sounded fine.  Extras: Deleted Scenes that help a little with the plot, production notes, trailer, commentary.  Menus: Nothing all that special. This is an average DVD release.
What You Should Do:  Rent it if you are a Samuel L. Jackson fan. It is an interesting mystery/character study that takes a little bit of work to get into. It's not your standard Saturday night entertainment fare. Mostly it is a showcase for Samuel L. Jackson's acting talent.

Not even another winning performance by Samuel L Jackson could save this pretentious clunker of a film. The book on which this screenplay was based is ludicrious enough, yet it seems like Lemmons to go out of her way to make the unbelievable premise even more ridiculous.
