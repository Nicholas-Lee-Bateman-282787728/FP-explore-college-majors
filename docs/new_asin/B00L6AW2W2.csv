6473023,1,B00L6AW2W2,"Actually, the Pope is the most respected religious leader in the world right now. Him and the Dalai Lama. Both of them make it clear that they don't condemn people whip don't subscribe to their personal belief systems. Laughing at someone who can't convince you to believe in something no one can engage with their five senses, yet is still supposedly able to send messages to special people who belong to systems that have over the past 50 years supported hate against others, insisted on the inferiority of others based on ethnic origin, religious belief or skin color, demanded that one sex bow to the other because of a conglomeration of different body parts, and so on, while those 'special people' are  often found out to be hypocritical, conmen, thieves, molesters of the innocent, bigots or advocates for torture and intolerance, isn't a form of 'persecution.' Christians in the US are not persecuted. Christians, especially Protestants, are often laughed at because they don't know their own religious histories and have often supposed the most oppressive cruelties against all of humanity. The majority of modern and even past Protestants have chosen the wrong side of history with breathtaking consistency, and then want to get upset when called on it.  The real John Luther did not for the most part, but then he started out as a Catholic monk who wanted to make people think for themselves.",1407283200,10,1403,4.965957446808511
6473024,5,B00L6AW2W2,"I really enjoyed the movie. The actors chosen, were top notch, and did a great job with the characters. The thing for me was that this movie could have been ripped from today's headlines. It was very relevant. It is edge of your seat action. Although this is a faith based movie, I believe anyone will enjoy it. It brings a major issue to the big screen that needs to be talked about. It's nice to have another movie that a family could watch together. There is so much out there that frankly isn't worth watching. I do recommend this movie if you like thrillers!",1406246400,50,563,4.371428571428571

6473036,1,B00L6AW2W2,"Christians are persecuted? What a crock. Let's cut the rhetoric and look at the facts. I know Christians aren't fond of facts but let's try it anyway. Christian hold every major office of power in our country. In fact anyone trying for higher office who didn't profess the Christian faith would find the task nearly impossible. Christian's makeup the vast majority of the people in our country and thus have more political power than any other group. Churches and Christian organizations receive billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies. So where is this persecution that I keep hearing them talk about. Is it because they no longer have complete control over our society? You could hardly call that  persecution. The fact is that Christians, especially white christians, are the most privileged group in America. So where is this persecution?
Superstition myth and religion will always be with us. (Unfortunately) but in wealthy and technologically advanced societies religious communities feel their influence waning. America has been unique among these societies and having a higher level of religious faith than most,but even here religion is slipping. There are more atheist and agnostic people in America than ever before and this is especially true among young people. This is what Christians are feeling and what they are labeling as persecution. As science and reason chip away at their world we can expect to see a lot more of this.",1482451200,,1456,5.092050209205021

6473060,1,B00L6AW2W2,"***WARNING: MAY be considered to have spoilers in this review -- although I tried not to say any more than necessary ***

This is quite possibly the worse movie I have ever seen.  It IS the worst supposedly ""Christian"" themed movie I have ever seen.  I wish I could give it 0 stars.  I am puzzled by how 45% of the past reviewers could give it 5 stars!  Apparently, we didn't see the same movie!

(1) The plot and point of the movie are NOT clear.  You can read between the lines and get the gist, but it is not laid out in any kind of logical and clear way.  There is no real explanation of the Fairness bill that the bad guy senator is trying to pass. Yes, it is a bill that supposedly makes it more difficult for ""Christians"" to speak the ""truth"" under the guise of making it more ""fair"" for all religions.  But there is no explanation of what the bill exactly says, does, the point of it, etc.  Since the bill is the reason for everything going on, I think they needed to include discussions about it adequate to really explain it.  Even when you FINALLY do find out WHY ""they"" supposedly wanted to pass the bill, the reason doesn't really make any sense either!  I guess their point of trying to make a political thriller was to keep you guessing until the end... well, they did accomplish that as you may very well remain clueless about the whole movie until the very end... and even then you aren't really sure!  The ending was abrupt, confusing, and left it somewhat hanging.

(2) The movie does not progress smoothly.  It is slow moving is many scenes, then switches to a new scene with no clarity of where you now are or why and you are left trying to figure out who the characters are in the new scene.  There are no clear introductions for most characters, except for a few such as the senator.  It doesn't help that many scenes are rather dark (as in, not adequately lit).  Basically, you have to figure out each scene AFTER the fact... sometimes long after the fact.

(3) There is NO true Christianity expressed in the film AT ALL.  As a Bible-believing Christian, I cringe every time I see a movie that is supposed to be Christian-themed but is replete with doctrinal errors and unflattering, inaccurate portrayals (which basically is almost EVERY supposedly ""Christian"" movie released to the big screen, with only a few exceptions such as Fireproof, etc.).  The main character appears to be a non-denominational televangelist of unclear beliefs.  Why is there a stand-up comic preceding him at his meetings?  Why is the stand-up comic making fun of the televangelist's sin-stained past?  No one in their right mind would do that.  This made NO sense at all.  Yes, anyone can be saved by Grace and have their sins forgiven and removed ""as far as the east is from the west"" (Psalm 103:12), but the Bible makes it clear that there are certain qualifications for a person to be a pastor or even teacher and I'm not really sure this guy would qualify for either.  It's hard to know because they only clearly referred to one failing, but made a big deal about him having a ""past"" so one wonders what else had been going on in his life.  Anyway, then you find out his ""dad"" is what appears to be a Catholic priest, but that doesn't make sense obviously (Catholic celibacy!), so maybe he really was an Episcopal or Lutheran, but I'm not sure either of those use a rosary as they showed in the movie.  So one wonders what ""brand"" of Christianity the main character supposedly espouses!

This COULD have been a good movie - but would have to be totally rewritten in order to be so!  It is a topic that is timely and if done WELL could make people think.  But Persecuted fails utterly on all counts.  It was 91 minutes of my life I will never get back, and now another half hour or so writing this review!  Please don't waste your time or money on this movie!",1443398400,2,3864,4.43404255319149

6473068,4,B00L6AW2W2,"Many of the reviews here are entirely mistaken and misleading.  Apparently by people who didn't watch too closely, just reacted to their own prejudices.  One reviewer says the protagonist Luther is Catholic.  Yet its made clear very early he belongs to no denomination and his faith perspective is evangelical Protestant.  Same reviewer says Luther continually seeks support and counsel from Catholics.  That reviewer apparently mistook Episcopalians for Catholics.  In fact, the priest Luther usually consults is his own father, which largely precludes him from being Catholic.  But even he had been Catholic, does that automatically equate to non-Christian?  Obvious anti-Catholic bias.  Others say Luther relies on intrigue and action rather than faith and prayer.  Actually, the movie clearly shows him relying on both.  Some also say the name of Jesus or Christ is never mentioned in the movie.  Untrue.  Both mentioned and shown in print.  Pay no attention to the biased negative reviews here.  Watch and judge for yourself.  After all, thats exactly what the Protestant principal of priesthood of the believer means, isn't it?  As an aside, its interesting to see evangelical Christian comedian Brad Stine playing the sellout who takes over Luthers ministry and even has designs on his wife.  He does a good job of playing it oily, egotistical, and evil.  Also Hollywood veterans Fred Thompson as Luthers father, Bruce Davidson as the antagonist Senator Donald Harrison, and Dean Stockwell as a ministry board member.  Also interesting that when the ministry board meets to sell out to the Senator for money and advantage, the statuette at the center of the conference table is a golden calf.  This movie doesnt smack you over the head with a Bible.  Its a more nuanced approach, as in He who has ears to hear, let him hear.",1436400000,3,1831,5.114864864864865

Veteran actor James Remar plays a great roll as a once corrupt man who found his faith and has become a popular preacher with millions of followers.
Because of his following by so many people some corrupt politicians want to exploit him for their own agenda which he sees and rejects the overtures to curry his support for a bad bill pending in congress they know his support would guarantee its passage.
Because he declines to support the bill he is blackmailed for murdering a prostitute to discredit him.

It's not possible that a religion that has persecuted millions world wide throughout it's history and in recent years protected pedophiles, promoted racism, built giant churches and auditoriums by preying on the poor and desperate without giving hardly anything back to the community and even now has declared war on women's rights to available health care by murdering and intimidating doctors and getting hateful and unethical state laws passed,could ever be persecuted without a revolution to overthrow the powers they wield and the politicians they bought and paid for.

6473172,4,B00L6AW2W2,I was surprised in viewing this movie how refreshing it was to see Jesus represented as the ONLY WAY To GOD.

6473193,1,B00L6AW2W2,"***WARNING: Spoiler Alerts In This Review!! ***

***Do NOT read if you do not want to know the plot! ***

Let me explain my position. I am a Christian who is more than willing to overlook the acting ability, characters, filming techniques, etc. Those things require money, which is not always easy to come by. What I am particular about is the message since that's the most important part of a film, and it costs almost nothing to create. This review is intended for likeminded individuals who have heard about this film and are curious to know whether it's worth purchasing or not.

The first element to note is that the main character, John Luther, is a Catholic. The reason why I bring this up is because it's a strong element to the plot, and also because it's not readily apparent in the trailer. Although the film portrays him as a Billy Graham-type character (a successful, influential Christian leader of a multi-national, religious organization), he is actually a devout Catholic, which is demonstrated later in the movie. In some scenes, Luther is seen holding a rosary to demonstrate his faithfulness while under stress. He also relies on the help of Catholic priests throughout the entire movie, so it's not a minor part of the film. In fact, all of the central good characters are Catholics. I don't recall seeing one Protestant, good or bad, in the movie. Also, the irony is not missed that the producers chose the name ""Luther"" for the main character who happens to be a devout Catholic.

The second element is the lack of spirituality in the film. There is little mention of the gospel or how Christians can rely on God as their anchor during times of persecution. Yes, there is one scene where he prays, but the rest of the film is about him trying to clear his name by relying on his abilities and the Catholic Church's resources. The film doesn't try to deal with how Christians should respond when persecution arises. Also, it never clearly addresses where God fits in when persecution comes. If you are looking for a film that attempts to answer such questions or deal with spiritual truths, then this film is not for you.

The third element is the portrayal of persecution. The message that the producers wanted to present is that religious freedom can be easily curtailed in the USA. This is true, and it's good that the producers wished to bring that to light; however, in a time when religious freedom is actually being curtailed in the United States, there are many other ways that they could have done it. Instead, the film depicts the story of a devout Catholic who manages to outsmart the government. This type of representation trivializes real persecution since it makes it appear almost trite; moreover, the film seems to indicate that religious persecution can be overcome with physical methods. This becomes more apparent when Luther obtains a gun. Although he doesn't freely use it, he sneaks around and reveals it to get what he wants. Such scenes are standard in today's action films, but it doesn't accurately depict what persecution is or would look like in the United States. As another reviewer noted, this film can be accurately described as The Fugitive with religious elements.

Sadly, I feel that the movie doesn't convey what it set out to do. I would support the movie if it tried to show that religious persecution against Christians is real or can come to North America; however, this was not done at all. The actual message in the movie is that there is religious persecution against Catholics and that the Catholic Church needs to band together to defeat the threat of over-reaching government. I personally think that the producers were torn between creating a movie with a message and an entertaining action film. In the end, the focus was on the action. If you are looking for a movie where the focus is on persecuted Christians, Jesus, or the Gospel, then I suggest that you look elsewhere since this movie doesn't adequately cover those subjects.

I'm giving this film 1 out of 5 stars because of the points mentioned above. With that said, it does talk about the threat of religious persecution in the United States and can be used to discuss real examples of persecution occurring here today. Other than that, it's a straight-up Hollywood action movie.",1415577600,52,4310,4.78494623655914

Yes, John Luther was being framed and that's not cool; however, I don't see this scenario happening any time soon.  When I think of persecution, I think of the Christians in the Middle East who are being killed or evicted from their homes for simply being Christian and not denouncing their faith.  Those are the truly persecuted people and their story needs to be told instead of rehashing another movie to put a Christian spin on it.",1413590400,8,601,4.75

That God is the only one who can reveal his salvation to us and the only way to Almighty God is through his Son, Jesus Christ. But that was the only time he showed any reason to be persecuted.

I don't mind watching fantasy, but at least make it interesting. This is the latest in a series of equally bad films that try to pretend that Christianity is somehow under attack. No one is attacking Christianity. In a world of modern science, logic and reason based education Christianity simply collapses upon its own empty, shallow, hyper-negative, human debasing message, and upon its logically, intellectually, and scientifically indefensible tenants. Christianity is going the way of Osiris, Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, Odin, and all the thousands of other gods. And fundamentalist Christians are in a full panic. Personally, I say good riddance.  The world will be a better place without such mind crippling nonsense.",1412899200,9,883,5.445255474452555
6473240,2,B00L6AW2W2,"""Freedom is fragile and costly and must be defended by work and by faith and even by blood."" John Luther (Remar) is one of the premiere evangelists in the country and his opinions and values are widely respected. Senator Donald Harrison is championing a bill that deals with sweeping religious reform and he needs Luther's backing. When he refuses the Senator frames him for a murder and ruins his name. Now Luther must not only find who did this and why but he must also clear his name. My practice of not watching trailers before the movie has both good and bad points. The good points are that I don't know what to expect and any twists given away in the trailer are surprises to me. The bad thing about it is that I have certain expectations based solely on the poster or cover of the case. Most of the time it works in my favor. This is one exception. I was expecting a movie like Red State where there is an evil preacher. Without getting too political or religious I have to say the irony in this movie was very in your face. As for the movie itself this is yet again another movie where the idea is much better than the actual movie. This started off tense and interesting but quickly fell flat and uninspired. The best way to watch this movie is to watch the first 15 minutes and the last 5. Everything else is generic and flat. Overall, a movie that started off with so much promise but I quickly lost interest in and struggled to finish. I give this a C.",1412812800,3,1465,4.311594202898551

8664056,1,B00L6AW2W2,"This is one of the more disappointing films that I have seen in this genre to date. First of all, I am a Christian and I actually enjoy Christian themed movies, but this film completely misses the mark.

Insofar as the movie's actual entertainment value, it is pretty bad. While there are some decent performances put in by a number of fine actors (including the late Sen. Fred Dalton), the script is the main problem. No amount of acting could overcome the inconsistent, erratic screenplay that these actors had to read from. The story is wildly melodramatic at times and just plain dumb in others. We never really find out what the main motivations of the good guys or bad guys are. In fact, I wasn't entirely sure who were the heroes and who were the vilians by the time the movie was over. The ending is a non-ending that just leaves a sour taste in your mouth.

This film is even more confusing from a religious standpoint. Is the main character Catholic, Protestant, a Mormon? We'll never know, as the character is so vague in his beliefs and the script so disjointed as you never really understand what the main character believes in. I can't even think of a specific point in this movie where Jesus' name is even mentioned.

Even more troubling is the main character's use of a gun to force confessions from bad guys and threaten others. He doesn't just wave the gun around, either. He fires at people. While they may have deserved to be shot at, it really makes his character seem violent and unhinged. Would Jesus go around waving a gun and threatening people, let alone shoot at them?

If there was some sort of worthwhile message in this movie, it was totally lost in transit. In the end, it is just a muddled mess of a film that doesn't even do a good job of teaching right from wrong, let alone spreading the word of Christ. If I didn't know better, I would almost think that this movie was made by Athiests to make Christians look bad.",1520380800,,1950,4.484507042253521
