6125156,5,B00H0EN98E,"I'm usually a little leery about rave reviews for a movie but in this case the movie more than lived up to my expectations. It was both funny(in a very dark sort of way, sort of like Doctor Strangelove)  and very scary (sort of like Play Misty for Me), WOW. The acting was first rate and very believable. It just goes to show that when the idle rich have a lot of time to kill they will come up with something totally out of the box and for me this film fits the bill, I would recommend it to anyone, first rate all the way.",1396224000,3,524,3.9904761904761905

6125159,4,B00H0EN98E,"Craig (Pat Healy) has a new baby, a new eviction notice, a last twenty, and he made the layoff list at work. While drowning his sorrows he runs into high school buddy Vince (Ethan Embry) who manages to get by as a low paying collector. While at the bar they meet Colin (David Koechner) and his birthday wife Violet (Sara Paxton). Colin offers the men money for doing small embarrassing or socially unacceptable tasks. As the night progresses the money increases and the dare factor becomes more risky.

On the surface, the film has about the same thrill as a home break-in/slasher film. In this case our working class men can walk out at any time, but don't due to the income potential. The film is a microcosm of capitalism where the money goes to individuals who are willing to do the worst tasks for less money, under bidding each other and even willing to commit crimes.

Good job by the actors, although I would have enjoyed a Violet who was bubbly instead of a dead pan individual. While it doesn't tie into the metaphor as well, it would have been more entertaining. Maybe have Taylor Swift in the role and then have her write a song about how wonderful it was for the closing credits.

6125162,4,B00H0EN98E,"This movie is about as crazy as a film can get!  Honestly, you never know what is going to happen next.  The movie runs a total of 88 minutes,...NOT 37 minutes as Amazon lists.  I'm pretty sure there was a short film by the same name some time ago and maybe the listing is getting that confused?  Either way, when you start watching it, it seems that it only last 37 minutes, because it's constantly keeping you interested and NEVER slows down!  Not only is this movie one ""thrill"" after the next, it's REALLY funny at times too!

The movie follows Craig (Pat Healy), a family man that is about to be evicted from his apartment.  Poor Craig, he only wants the best for his wife and young child.  After being fired from his job as an ""oil change technician"", he decides to go to the local bar and have a drink before returning home.  It is there that he encounters his old high school friend, Vince (Ethan Embry).  Let me just say, I dig Ethan Embry as an actor.  I wish that he would get more staring roles.  How he manages to pull off the role of Vince, I have no idea, but he does and he is perfect as a result.

As Craig and Vince begin to catch up over drinks, they meet a strange couple, Colin (David Koechner) and his wife, Violet (Sara Paxton).  This is when the movie really begins to get interesting.  After introductions, they invite Craig and Vince to play a game.  Basically, they throw down a sum of money and a challenge and the first to complete the task wins.

After a few short scenes, the 4 find themselves back at one of the many homes belonging to couple.  Colin continues to challenge the guys with seemingly meaningless tasks, until Violet lays down a challenge of her own.  Craig reluctantly completes the task and makes his exit as the couple is in the other room changing clothes.

This is where the movie REALLY takes it up a notch with the challenges.  I won't go any further because, well,...what would be the fun in that?!

All in all, I REALLY enjoyed this movie.  It seemed to be the ideal running time.  I only hope they make a sequel!

Final Verdict: RENT IT!  You'll dig it!

6125171,4,B00H0EN98E,"This is either brilliantly written or badly written. I don't know because I don't know what the writers were intending. If this is a brilliant horror film with a hidden monster and a strong counter culture message, it deserves a five for having guts to carry it's message so quietly and so well. If this is actually a case of plot holes and bad writing with socially accepted traditions meant to paint in the rest of the character, it's worth a two for being lazy and relying on socially accepted clich&eacute;s. I'm giving it a 3.5 (rounded to 4) to be safe. Overall it was worth the watch but I don't think I'd rewatch it any time soon.

Why do I say this might be a counter-culture messaged horror film? Spoilers ahead.

We are supposed to feel sympathetic for Craig because he has a wife and kid and is going to be evicted. When you are going to be evicted you have to miss rent for multiple months, be given multiple ""you are late, please pay"" warnings, and then you are given an eviction notice. He shouldn't have been shocked to see the eviction notice on his door. Also, how does the wife NOT know about the money problems? How poor is his relationship with his super important family that he couldn't have a talk about their spending habits? If things are this bad certainly there are other bills not being paid. That means lots of collection notices. Working as a mechanic is good money. He lives in a small apartment in a cheap neighborhood. How did he end up so far in the rear? Also, mechanics are always desirable. Finding more work should have been easy. Put it all together and you get a neglectful prideful/fearful man who lies to his family constantly, probably as a selfish attempt to save face at his failed writing career. This is NOT the behavior of a responsible, loving father and husband. It's a simmering monster.

And then we have Vince the sex-maniac dropout who has done nothing with his life supposedly. Wait, if that's true, why is he the one with a stable place to sleep, money, and a job? Ok, so he went to jail once, but he has been on the right side of the law since then. It's not like we haven't heard of anyone ever making a mistake then trying to get better. When we first see Vince he offers Craig a few hundred bucks to try to help him. He worked hard at menial jobs that pay way less than a mechanic makes to get that money. People won't give him better jobs because he has a criminal record. Vince even says so. A few hundred bucks is a week's pay for him. He doesn't care, he wants to help. When he finds out this won't help, he is sad. He encourages Craig to do things because he wants to help Craig feel better any way he can, even if that means goading him to have some drinks and to play the couple's game for awhile. Vince can be competitive even to the point of playing dirty, but outside of that he doesn't appear to be a selfish or cruel man. He even apologizes for most of the things he ends up doing to Craig. This is not a monster. It's a man who makes mistakes.

He and Craig supposedly were alike in high school except for the fact that Vince was always standing up for Craig because Craig was too scared to stand up for himself. What happened? Vince didn't get married or have kids. He chose not to follow the status quo of ""get a woman, get a job, get a baby, die"" that society forces on people. Without those extra responsibilities tossed on him he could think clearly and realised when things went too far. Craig was willing to lose the last shreds of his humanity in order to maintain the socially approved way of living. Vince wasn't. This message is about as counter culture as you can get.

If this message was the writer's intention, kudos for being bold enough to buck the standard ""babies and families are always good and all good people have them"" clich&eacute;.  If the lack of research into what would lead to Craig's situation plus the clich&eacute; excuse that being a parent somehow makes everything he does OK as it's ""for the family"" actually turned what was supposed to be a hero into a monster, then this movie sucks. As to which it is, unless the creators straight up say then I wouldn't know. Watch it if it interests you. That's all I can say.",1463184000,3,4224,4.360864040660737

6125183,5,B00H0EN98E,"Equally depraved and enthralling.

I watched this on a whim in Amazon Instant Video. Anything with David Koechner is usually a pretty good movie.

The acting is superb, at least in my opinion. I was surprised by Koechner's adaptation to a role like this. Though not entirely humorous, not the usual comedy bits he's known for (Out Cold). His wife is muted, distant, but involved; drives things forward. (Except for one sulking bit.) The two guys competing for cash are great polar opposites -- one reserved becomes depraved, and one depraved has certain reservations.

Allegorical in the sense of the lengths people will go to depravity in the face of it; and indifference of people who have it all, seeking cheap thrills at the expense of others when money buys everything else (buy more).",1455926400,,790,4.880597014925373

6125264,5,B00H0EN98E,"There are lots of films out there that ask, ""What would YOU do for $250,000?"" or whatever x amount of money seems most provocative. These films tend to be sanctimonious and contrived and bereft of humanity, far too preoccupied with being thought provoking. The characters involved are usually not characters at all, but either generic everyman types or humbug stereotypes drawn up in the name of making some sort of social commentary.

The difference here is that Cheap Thrills doesn't really care what you would do because it's blessed with two real characters, rounded and believable, and the relationship between them feels very real. If you're looking to have your thoughts provoked there's plenty of opportunity here, but it's also just entertaining and enlightening in its own right.

Every member of this ensemble cast of five adult players does an excellent job here. If there is one standout it's David Kouchner, whom you've probably seen in the background of countless movies. His understated performance here could have carried the filmIf you like this movie singlehandedly, but that's not necessary because the rest of the cast is so good. If you know Sara Paxton as the innocent tomboy from The Innkeepers, she's going to surprise you here. As the two friends who gradually become rivals, Pat Healy and Ethan Embry both turn in superb performances, Healy all steely intensity and Embry with a cuddly buddy buddy sweetness that belies the fact that his character is pretty screwed up deep down.

 If you enjoy this, and I hope you do, I would suggest also checking out the movie Favor by director Paul Osborne. An excellent social commentary that's wins by not trying too hard to prove its point.",1427068800,,1708,4.961538461538462

Life is full of all these opportunities to get what you want, but you usually just have to do all this bulls*** in order to get it. Its always your choice, right? But when desperation and real need is thrown into the mix, things can get fuzzier.

If theres any real lesson at all to this movie (and somehow it actually seems like there is), its in a line halfway through: Your life is what youve made it. Choices and all, even if choice isn't always the right word. Thats a wise observation, but its a halfway lesson.

It also brings up the absurdity of deserving the money that, in this case, is just whats offered for insane bets and dares. Do we deserve something just because we expect it? If not, where does deserve come from, and exactly how is it connected to the things we do?

For a movie that started off as a comedy, however dark, and had some genuinely hilarious moments scattered throughout, it ends on a profoundly grim note. The curtain falls on an image that reminds us of why we make extreme decisions, and the viewer is practically begged to consider what the hidden costs might have been.",1409788800,,1207,4.355555555555555

6125415,2,B00H0EN98E,"When a movie is this demeaning, disgusting, and depressing, but you can't stop watching it to find out how it ends, then you know the filmmakers have gotten under your skin and are dealing with something important.

By now, you know the basic plot:  Sadistic rich couple offer money to two losers in an escalating game of cruelty and humiliation.  The couple seemingly enjoy seeing how far they can push two friends who are down on their luck to engage in humiliating acts and ultimately turn on each other.

This seems like a simple political allegory - rich people exploiting poor people for their amusement.  But it's deeper than that.  Because of the way the plot is structured, there are no heroes in this would-be morality tale, and the film devolves toward a nihilist conclusion.

There is a point in the story where the main character, Craig, has won enough money to meet his dire financial obligations.  We root for him to end the game and leave-- that would be a moral victory-- but he doesn't.  Driven by greed, selfishness and pure macho pride, the two men persist in competing for ever larger sums doing ever more degrading tasks.

Perhaps the message is that once you force a man to sell out for a few bucks, he loses the capacity to make further moral choices; he loses his soul (clearly the rich couple have already lost theirs).  And that turns out to be what is necessary to survive in our world, the filmmakers seem to be claiming with their ending.

But I don't buy it.  Our better selves have the ability to make tough moral choices in the face of adversity.  To walk away from games like this.  You don't need to sell your soul to thrive, or even survive.  I very much wanted this film to end differently, to show us a hero rising above his challenges and reclaiming his soul.  That is what kept me watching until the end.  I wish now that I had done what I wanted Craig to do; just walk away.",1407542400,,1915,4.469740634005763

On the one hand it seems like either a stylized conceptual thriller, but on the other hand it works really hard to sell its unnatural premise as a piece of naturalism. Unfortunately, there are too many instances where it is far too obvious that the screenwriter is pulling the character's strings in a very unnatural way (to try to get us to the next plot point as if naturalistically) for it all to hold together.
That said, the film is not without its gross-out levels of fun. Pat Healy delivers a pretty terrific outstanding performance, and you've never seen David Koechner be this good at being so complex and understated.
If the movie had managed to succumb a bit more to its unrealistic premise by either delivering some satisfying plot twists or existing in a more stylized world I think it would have been a bigger success. A mixed bag of thrills.",1406678400,,1031,4.48936170212766

I kept thinking the end would tie up a very simple story, and masterfully weave together a more complex, ulterior plot in a way similar to how Alfred Hitchcock would do it. There lame attempt having the story based on a bet between a husband and wife, did not work for me.  This story could have been written by a group of kids, since the story has no good reason based in reality, as to why two people would want to take a chance of being indicted for murder.  After the movie is over, hypothetically, the next day, the main character would likely be questioned by the police and the other characters would also likely get indicted and they would all being going to jail.  I will say it was filmed, put together well and had good actors, just the story is unbelievable and did not work for me.  I wish it would have.",1405209600,,966,4.2

Ethan Embry is plainly obnoxious -- he's not a very convincing provocateur. Pat Healy looks the part of a pathetic loser in dire straits, but this does not make for any redeeming value in his character. And more than others, David Koechner has no excuse for being such a sad sack in this production. He's trying to skate by on the same old characterizations he's played out in other, much more successful, films. The writers and director of this film (see IMDB) come from a background of average (and some sub-par) productions mostly in the horror/sci-fi genre and they can't quite seem to carry that theme forward into this film.

6125918,4,B00H0EN98E,"Seeing the trailer, then browsing the reviews, both 1-star and 5-star ratings, avoiding ones with spoilers, one gets a good sense what to expect.

In short, Cheap Thrills delivers on its promise;  a well executed film.

But, Cheap Thrills is much more than just a film. It stands as a metaphor for the western civilization. Its brilliance is in the subtle deliverance of this message to the audience. The deft will walk away having experienced a new documentary format, the daft, a raw thriller/horror flick, ready for the next workday water-cooler banter.

The protagonist of the movie is your everyday, blue-collar Joe, or in this case Craig. He has a family, a job, rent and bills. All things that keep him occupied on a daily basis. Vince, Craigs long-lost friend, is more of a misfit of society. Vince has no family and has an unorthodox occupation, yet, he too has to scramble to feed himself on a daily basis.

Next, enter the antagonists of the story. A nice looking couple. The man very wealthy, assertive and confident, with a very beautiful, young wife. With all the money and amenities they can afford, the wife seems very bored and disinterested. Hence, the two are always out looking for, you guessed it, insert-title-of-the-movie-here to keep boredom at bay.

The two antagonists represent the elite of society. The ones who have it all and make the rules, by which, the rest must play. This is made evident when the four characters meet. The way the system works is, if you play by the rules, you are rewarded and get to move ahead. If you refuse to play by the rules, then there is no reward.

Our characters learn rather quickly how the system works. The system conditions (trains) them in phases. Each phase, escalates their exposure to the system, the risks and gains. As Craig and Vince learn the rules, they start to become comfortable, and in a strange way, enjoy playing the games, and start to feel part of the system and one with the elite. This is a mistake. The two characters are clearly there for the entertainment and enjoyment of their rulers, who set the rules of the games for them to play. Not playing the game simply means no reward, however, try and make your own rules, and you are corrected in no time; as Vince finds out when his pet idea is shutdown and frowned upon.

In the end, the elite get what they want, at the expense of their underlings. It shows that they can even get away with murder. And the serf must follow the rules set forth by their masters.",1403913600,,2500,4.602247191011236

Make no mistake, with the the exception of Sara Paxton (who really doesn't do too much talking anyway), the movie is well-acted. David Koechner is the standout, and he does a sort-of twisted version of his comic persona here. The movie is also well-made on a technical level, and is actually quite restrained in terms of gore. Granted, the movie isn't trying to be anything profound, but I've seen so much ""torture porn"" by this point, that I suppose I've become numb to it. This movie just didn't hit me in the way I thought it might. The best part of the movie is learning that all the events that transpired were part of a sick bet between a husband and wife. Everything else was just too familiar, and a little underwhelming. Overall, I thought it was a slight waste of my time, although fans of indie horror might get more enjoyment out of it than I did.

6125935,1,B00H0EN98E,"Not a comedy in my book....not even a so called ""dark"" one. The basic premise is a VERY cynical social commentary that some people will do ANYTHING for enough money, and others are so jaded that cruelty counts as a good time. In the beginning of the film you might empathize with the lead character ""Craig"" getting an eviction notice the same day he loses his job. By the end of the film, you hate him as much as everyone else in the film. Craig's wife is the only sympathetic character in the film and she on screen for less than 5 minutes.

Here is the plot summary I read,

 ""A recently fired father facing eviction agrees to take on an escalating series of insane challenges in exchange for cash payments from a rich couple with a twisted sense of humor.""

I was expecting the ""challenges"" to be along the lines of the tv show punk'd, or possibly like the pranks from ""Jackass"". There isn't anything creative or fun about the ""challenges"" they are basically just degradation for cash.

6125938,4,B00H0EN98E,"When I first added this to my watchlist, I kept putting it off because the synopsis reminded me of 3 movies I had recently seen or could still clearly remember: 13 Sins, the original Thai one: 13: Game of Death, and Would You Rather. Eventually, I got to it. Its a different experience than any of those. First, there's little mystery or conspiracy, as in the first 2 I mentioned. Compared to the latter, WYR, this one feels a bit more serious. WYR had a very strong tongue in cheeky like flavor in its execution. It teetered on campy in its look, not so much the plot. Cheap Thrills started out feeling pretty real. When the antagonists showed up, they were a little over the top but I quickly grew accustomed to them and that slightly garish touch they brought faded. Watching the competitiveness unfold between the 2 protagonists/friends was very interesting. I had a sense where it might be heading but I didn't feel like it was telegraphed. When the climactic moment arrived, it took me by surprise. I also like the subtext it raises, about calculating the value of a life. In many horror, and not horror flicks, when a sacrifice is called for in order for others to live, most often the folks who reproduced claim privilege and then present a rational argument as to why that should rightly be so. This despite the greatest threat to a sustainable planet, and life for any, being overpopulation. This argument comes up so often and sounds so similar across movies, shows, etc. that I can't help but believe it reflects a larger culturally sanctioned belief. In my eyes, an individual's life is the most valuable thing they possess, as any other thing of value is dependent on it. Once you're dead, there is nothing to be valued. Its done. While anyone can and should feel that their life (or someone they love's life) is more valuable than another's life (a neutral person), its a completely different thing to expect that individual to agree with you, that your life is inherently more valuable than theirs (for whatever reason). That's just crazy. A similar argument comes up here, to justify one's behavior towards another. The ending really brings the hypocrisy front and center and makes you think (I hope).",1403136000,,2218,4.719072164948454
6125939,5,B00H0EN98E,"I started out thinking I was in for a one star cheap production. Suggested by the cheap cover and the usual money saver of no subtitles along with Drafthouse Films and Snoot Films as the production companies.  That, plus the cheap one room setting, did not put me into an accepting frame of mind. I was thinking along the B level film lines of Tarantino. But, about a third of the way into the film I began to glimpse it's potential. The judgmental viewer exploring forbidden territories in human behavior. The apparent raising of the stakes is not what carries the film - it's the great writing, acting (especially Paxton's mostly nonverbal communication), camera work and directing. Candidly funny, alternating with candidly disturbing, displays of what humans are capable of when fenced in by certain restraints. A good film for a psych or soc class as a vehicle for student discussion. Some alternate endings would have made it even more interesting.",1402704000,,954,4.925465838509317

I found it to be highly satisfying shocking and surprising and not at all predictable. If you like seeing the lengths people will go to for money when they really need it then you need to rent or buy Cheap Thrills as it is a film I could easily watch over again.

6125961,1,B00H0EN98E,"It's important for me to establish that I'm not squeamish.  I don't shy away from blood and gore in films or, for that matter, in real life.

Cheap Thrills, though, seems to be an exercise in grossing out the audience for no reason except to pound home its dubious theme that everyone has a price.  And yet the film is so poorly written that I'm not certain there there *is* a theme.  People enjoy manipulative cruelty?  Maybe that's what they were trying to say.  Or perhaps it's just another exercise in the kind of gross-out fare that came to dominate ""reality TV"" shows a few years ago?  Maybe.

[SPOILER ALERT]  The film consists of a smarmy hipster in a trendy little pork pie hat and his seemingly zombified wife paying a couple of working chumps to perform an increasingly repulsive series of stunts.  With each stunt, the big-money stakes go higher, and the two down-at-their-heels chumps find themselves competing for payoffs from the guy with the silly hat.

[SPOILER ALERT] As mentioned, familiar territory.  Until such stunts as offering big money to the first of the chumps who can break into the hat-man's neighbors' house and s*** on the floor, with photograph evidence.  Or bigger money -- thousands of dollars! -- to the first one who allows his pinky to be chopped off.  Or eat a dish of something so repugnant that ... I don't even want to think about it. [END SPOILERS]

Apparently there are people who enjoy this kind of fare, so maybe I'm being too squeamish.  I don't think so.  All I can say is that I really, really wish I had never watched this disgusting excuse for a film.",1401148800,2,1601,4.6007067137809186

6125963,4,B00H0EN98E,"Cheap Thrills is one of the most effective low-budget indie flicks I've seen in years. Unfortunately, the laughs stop once the blood starts to run, and this once funny movie becomes dull and gross.

Two high school buddies run into each other at a pub. Craig (Pat Healy) is tossing them back with his former bud Vince (Ethan Embry) when their night intersects with a random couple celebrating Violet's (Sara Paxton) birthday. Her husband Colin (David Koechner) conjures up a contest to get a couple of random nobodies (Craig & Vince) to perform various stunts for cash. The pot is $250K.

Most of the flick is pretty innovative, and is something like a scripted Jackass episode. Colin and Violet are excellent as a twisted rich couple out to watch other people torture themselves for money. They stage their own private minstrel show that starts with silly pranks and ends in a pool of blood. The majority of the film is excellent, and reminded me of David Lynch. The 3rd act is when everything falls apart. The gore ruins the fun, and the ending is not ironic or clever... Just sad. A strong 3.5.",1400198400,,1097,4.678756476683938
6125994,4,B00H0EN98E,"There is a saying: People will do anything for money"". In the movie Cheap Thrills the boundaries of the saying is explored to its full extent. Fair warning to moviegoers - this film is not for the squeamish.
When Craig (Pat Healy) is having his worst day ever, a drink before going home to his wife seems to be just the answer. A long lost friend, played by Ethan Embry, shows up and after a few more drinks they reminisce and ponder Craigs money woes. Then the duo meets a wealthy, but, unusual couple with money to burn. The husband likes making crazy cash bets on seemingly harmless pranks.
After bar hopping while playing pranks on waitresses, patrons and strippers, the craziness brings a bloody punch in the nose to Craig. Encouraged by the hundreds of dollars offered by the wealthy couple, played by David Koechner and Sara Paxton, Craig and Vince hope the nights activities will garner easy money. The cash prizes grow larger as increasingly difficult tasks make you wonder how badly either man needs money.
What transpires is sort of a combination of The Hangover and Saw. A dark comedy with a message. Not really what I expected, but still, lots of thrills and jaw dropping action. I was caught off guard by the casting of funny-man Koechner and half expected to have some laughs along the way. Sara Paxton does a nice job of playing the kinky young wife with a sexy smile and both Healy and Embry are excellent.
I think the director, E.L. Katz, has done a great job crafting this picture visually and with compelling and believable characters. This is one of only a few feature films he has directed. I hope to see more from him.
Cheap Thrills starts March 21st  (according to IMDB.com) and hopefully will be in local theaters at that time. Whether you see it direct to video, or in the theater, remember this is a bloody and violent movie that is not suitable for children. I give it four stars for being a surprising and clever thriller with a Twilight Zone style story-line.",1398902400,,1989,4.602816901408451

6125996,5,B00H0EN98E,"In the first ten minutes of this film, husband and young father Craig is served both an eviction notice and a pink slip. The next eighty minutes will leave you debating if this is in fact the worst thing that happens to him on that day.

Because, before going home to face his family, Craig stops by a bar to get a few shots in him, and that's where he runs into an old high school pal he hasn't seen in years, the whiskery, slightly-off Vince. After catching up on old times, the old friends then meet the acquaintance of Colin and Violet, a married couple that -- it appears -- is rich beyond comprehension. It's Violet's birthday, and to celebrate, they've taken to the town with a ton of cash and a gambling compulsion that is imaginative and all-encompassing. $50 to the first man to take a shot of tequila. $100 to the first guy to get a woman to slap him in the face. Slap that stripper's butt? $200.

The movie bills itself as a dark comedy, but there's not a whole lot of humor here. I don't count that against the film, which turns out to be a richly disturbing portrayal of human psychology and sociology as the bets get more expensive and more dangerous. It's not just about what a man is willing to do to provide for his family, but it's also about how the degradation is amplified by the competition between the two old friends who, it may turn out, don't know each other as well as they used to.

Remarkably simple as a script and plot, the real meat here lies in the almost masterful subtlety of the performances, not just from our lead (Pat Healy), but especially from David Koechner, a seasoned comedic actor whose nuanced portrayal of Colin makes him seem both warm and evil at the same time. Carried on the shoulders of these two performers, the film -- in spite of its no-frills approach to story-telling -- gains a lasting complexity that will resonate as much as disturb, even to the last frame. And although the tale itself isn't all that unique (inspired by everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Games/dp/B008I411EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Games</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trading-Places/dp/B00373HYJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trading Places</a>), it is told with such unassuming and unpretentious confidence that it puts no filters between its very dark truths and the audience, making it a movie that will stick with you long after the last drop of blood is shed.",1398556800,,2520,5.067469879518073

The duo agrees and even goes back to the couples house with them, and that's when things really start to get bizarre. I feel like I've seen something similar and far more serious before, but I can't place my finger on it. What I really liked about this film was that despite it's B-movie status, and obvious lack of quality writing, what goes down isn't as expected as you would think. A lot of it really was surprising and they do spare us the pain and torture of doing what is obvious. I also enjoyed Pat Healy as Craig, he's not the kind of character you'd expect to see in a movie like this, and he added an interesting dynamic to a cast that was otherwise pretty droll. Cheap Trills has a few funny and unexpected moments in it, and to be honest it was better than I thought it would be.
