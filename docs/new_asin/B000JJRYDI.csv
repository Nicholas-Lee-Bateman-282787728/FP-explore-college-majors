2672788,1,B000JJRYDI,"Okay - You've got the Vice Presidential plane (with David Keith aboard) traveling over the Pacific Ocean without Naval escort fighters, in a tropical storm that should have been predicted and avoided. The storm puts the plane down near an unknown island (Barago!). No emergency call, no secondary channel, no emergency transponder beeping after the plane goes down. And last but not least, only one Secret Service Agent onboard (Mariel Hemingway). The President orders a search for the ""Second most powerful man in the World"" Duh.... The President comes across as a real low I.Q. doofus. The Naval Admiral is also an idiot.

After some ""A-Team type"" gun battles, the Guerillas take the VP hostage for a large ransom (what else?). Mariel takes only a 9mm subgun, instead of an assault rifle, from the scumbags. The Guerilla leader is especially obnoxious in the acting department. I mean, low-down, amateur, stinking bad acting. Hemingway and Keith must have taken the lead from the extras; because they were just as bad. You'll wonder why the person who wrote the dialogue wasn't left on the island; where everything else about this movie should have been left. Oh, and it seemed like they hired some pretty bad Samoan or Hawaiian actors for this stinker. They grunt a lot.

If you can stand just killing time and watching a [horrible] movie, then go ahead. Heck, you can go to the ""John"" a few times, go out for some pizza, and even walk your dog. You won't miss anything. When jobs in Hollywood are sparse, I guess you take anything yo can get (Mariel and David did) and hope that at least the director can save the script (he didn't.) Absolutely stunk !",1235088000,5,1656,4.7665505226480835
2672789,3,B000JJRYDI,"This is your typical TV Movie. It is not top of the line. I still get laughs about the atomic hand grenades used in movies like these. Fact it guys about a 1/4 of TNT exploding in the open is not going to throw out a fireball and pick of 10 0r so men. They then get up and keep fighting.
Not a hardcore lez dyke thing. Not a sex thing either. Orientation yes...naked women having lunch.. NOT!!! So you horny guys looking for titties etc....NOT this  movie. A kiss twice that is twice in this movie is it.
I enjoyed it. IT is available at so reasonable price. I may even buy one.
I still laugh at the atomic hand grenades and other silliness.",1213920000,2,641,4.128

2672791,2,B000JJRYDI,The acting is fantastic by Muriel. The rest of the cast is poor and the plot is ok... The only thing is I kept comparing it to Personal Best,1180742400,,140,3.8620689655172415
2672792,3,B000JJRYDI,"Don't expect too much high quality anything with this film and you should enjoy the action.

Mariel Hemingway could still turn heads and interrupt conversations just by walking in the room and Jill Bennett would get more than her wanted fair share of female attention!

I reckon that it was the hope of the cast and crew that their audience would leave all sense of rationality and believability behind when they pushed the 'play' button on their DVD players. I wasn't expecting Academy Award performances and so found myself pleased with my purchase and a welcome addition to my 'collection'.

One question I found myself asking throughout the film... Why was Jill Bennett wearing a nice bright 'shoot-me-if-you-can' RED shirt when all the other characters were suitably attired in camouflage gear?!?  Again, leave your sense of rationality behind.",1175385600,10,849,5.130434782608695
2672793,3,B000JJRYDI,"""In Her Line of Fire"" (also known as ""Air Force Two"") is benefited from the strong performances from the leads, especially Mariel Hemingway as touch and no-nonsense Secret Service agent who has to protect the Vice President of the United States (David Keith) from the mercenaries when their airplane went down. David Millburn is Armstrong, psycho leader of the military training camp.

The film's contrived story doesn't bother us much because actions start almost immediately after the plane crush. Not many people, even the guerrillas in the jungle, would shoot an unarmed person as the film depicts, but anyway the film is only trying to do what it is supposed to do.

The actions of the film are not bad, just OK with several familiar set-pieces. At first sight the actions of the film look like those made in the 80s, like Stallone's ""Cobra"" or Schwartzenegger's ""Commando,"" but they are done with much less ammunition or humor here. Moreover, explosions are substituted by special effects, which most action film fans would find disappointing.

The film's strength is Mariel Hemingway's strong acting. Her relation with a surviving journalist played by Jill Bennett is among the most interesting aspects of the film because of the suggested lesbian theme, but the film does not seem to develop the intriguing subplot much. (Or I may have missed the point.) Anyway, otherwise this is a typical B action film with a standard action plot that is made for action film fans.

""In Her Line of Fire"" is not a terrible film as you might believe, thanks to the presence of Mariel Hemingway and her character. Still it is also true that she is the only reason I give three stars which this film itself may not deserve.",1174608000,19,1714,4.859589041095891

2672796,3,B000JJRYDI,"A bit far-fetched, but no more so than Air Force One.  Come on, AF1 getting hijacked.  It was good entertainment.

Check out the trailer for this movie, looked okay.  I've always enjoyed David Keith in everything he's done.  Hemingway is a decent actor.  Bennet the other female lead in the trailers comes across stale.  And Milbern a zero. I know it's just trailers and perhaps those two are better in other parts of the movie, but I haven't seen the movie - just a lot of trailers.

The CGI of Air Force 2 is weak.

It's a no brainer action movie.  Like action, watch it, want something to stir the grey-matter, the trailer says 'pass this one by'.",1171238400,5,650,4.432203389830509

2672809,1,B000JJRYDI,"To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I have enjoyed Mariel Hemingway's acting in every other movie I've seen her in, but even her acting was poor in this terrible movie.  Story, acting, photography, etc., etc. was awful.  I was going to donate this to charity, but have decided to toss it instead.  By far, the worse movie I've ever seen.",1452988800,,350,4.596774193548387

2672816,5,B000JJRYDI,"Mariel Hemingway doing her thing in wonderful fashion.
This film is quite often listed as a lesbian film and thereby totally misleading.
One or two small kisses during an entire film do not make it a lesbian flick.
A good film and well worth watching.",1425600000,2,251,4.6

2672829,4,B000JJRYDI,"If you can get passed the issues at the beginning, the movie is an acceptable to way to spend some time on a movie that doesn't require you to think, and has a strong female lead that kicks ass and doesn't bother to ask names.

The issues at the very beginning are: 1. Too Few Secret Service on the Vice Presidents plane.  2. Private planes, including those of the Potus and VPotus have normal seating for turbulance and take-offs and landings.  People wouldn't just sit around a conference table trying to hang on. 3. Planes that land in the water must do a nose up crash landing attempt.  Nose down would result in the plane tumbling and breaking apart.  (See the Landing on the Hudson videos for examples of a well executed water landing).  4:  Planes do not sink immediately upon a water landing, especially ones that have the fuselage intact.  (Again, see the Landing on the Hudson for an example).

Hemmingway and Bennet manage to to be convincing in their roles, despite the issues with those mentioned above and the overall fact that this is certainly not at the quality of Air Force One.  There are two scenes where Hemmingway and Bennet kiss, and the tension between them is done well although not by any means is it palpable.

Hemmingway is still hot as hell and Bennet looks almost like a baby lez compared to her, but it isn't an unrealistic pairing considering the movie isn't a ""Lez Flick"",  I do like that the background attraction (not the main plot) is 2 women.  It is nice to see this in a movie where their relationship isn't the focus of the movie, nor is it angst between the 2 characters.  A welcome change.

I ponied up the rental cost to watch the movie, but if B-grade action movies aren't your thing, I recommend checking out review trailers and video clips on line first before you think about paying the rental fee. Although there are far worse things you can spend 3 dollars for, including that flavored muck some coffee places pass off as drinkable.

Overall, I am not crying for my money back and I don't wish I could get back the 1+ hour that I spent watching.  Although I wouldn't rent it again in the future, however if it showed up on any free streaming service I might consider watching it again.",1416873600,2,2233,4.5012406947890815
2672830,1,B000JJRYDI,"I bravely watched until minute 19. By then my suspension of disbelief was mortally wounded, and I returned to my useful task of peeling the potatoes for dinner. As a materials engineer, does anyone have any idea what it takes to break the pressurized double panes of glass on today's commercial airliner?  Buoyancy factor?  The plane crashes and instantly turns into a submarine. One? secret service agent guarding the ""Second Most Powerful Man in the World"". Really!  Opening up and riddling an unarmed unidentified person posing no threat to anyone?  And this is Only The Beginning.
Actually, to go on would be the proverbial act of 'flogging a dead horse"".  Sufficient to say that a great deal of time, money, and questionable acting prowess could have been saved by just having refused to produce this film. Mariel Hemingway lost many points in my esteem for 'starring' in this one. The president, the admiral and many other should have been left on this uncharted island. Please save my poor soul.

2672847,3,B000JJRYDI,"I have to admit I bought this movie just because I was once in love with the stunningly beautiful Mariel Hemingway. Now 20 years later, she still looks pretty good and has obviously gotten into doing B-action flicks. The story is simple - Air force two, with the vice President on board, crashes on a tropical island. It's now up to the VP's bodyguard (Hemingway) to rescue him. But what they don't know is that the island is a training camp for a group of terrorists. The action scenes are not great, but acceptable for a low budget movie. The same goes for the acting. But overall a nice b-action movie, with the unusual approach of having a female (lesbian) heroine.",1263772800,11,669,4.537190082644628
