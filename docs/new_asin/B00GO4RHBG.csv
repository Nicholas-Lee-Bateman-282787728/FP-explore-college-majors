8625266,3,B00GO4RHBG,"With a total running time of only 228 minutes (which could have fit on 1 or 2 dvd`s), i think this set is way overpriced. Disc 1 is a docudrama dealing with the somme battle, but it seems to take forever until we actually get to the main attack. However the reenactments are well done, and i feel that this episode is the most compelling of the three discs. Disc 2 is mildly interesting-historians and researchers analyze archival footage taken by british cameramen at the somme...they try to decide whether the footage is real or staged, where the actual footage was shot, and they also try to find out who some of the actual soldiers are in the film-which proves to be a very difficult task. What i found most interesting about this episode is the footage of modern day france where the battle took place-you can still see craters from massive mine explosions and where the trench lines were dug. Disc 3 is about weapons used by the british during the war-you see the Enfield rifle and Vickers machine gun in action, but no mention of artillery or any german equipment....yes, disc 2 and 3 are entirely from a british perspective. So there it is - to sum it up, i was looking for more content to equal the rather high asking price",1406246400,7,1232,4.504464285714286
