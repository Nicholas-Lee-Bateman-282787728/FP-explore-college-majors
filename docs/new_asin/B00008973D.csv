1830357,5,B00008973D,"This is the perfect movie to watch with some friends, MST3K-style. I have never seen such shlock in my life. It is awful beyond compare. ""It's so bad, it's good"" was never more fitting. The music is terrible. The acting is horrendous. You do get to see a young Ice-T at a rap audition doing what sounds like a demo version of ""Cop Killer."" And listen to our hero rapping about colors for a group of kids (""Green is the color of the rasta's stash!""). Sealab 2021 fans should be happy to see that Harry Goz (Capt. Murphy) makes one of his few film appearances here as an evil real estate tycoon, or something. And for comedy value, you cannot beat the evil gang leader who spouts every known cliche arch-nemesis line known to man.

Jowl Silberg, you are the man.",1106697600,,760,4.390070921985815
1830358,5,B00008973D,Joanna Gardner was in one of the scenes singing with Eugene Wilde. They sounded wonderful! Joanna is definately a star and anyone that workd with her will be delighted! Her voice is definately phenominal!,1097798400,3,204,5.029411764705882
1830359,3,B00008973D,This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  Even though the performances are not fabulous the film is memorable for it's cast.  Even Ice-T has one of his pre-gangsta performances i.e. Breakin' & Breakin'2.  This is a must have for 80s hip hop fans.  Eric LaSalle of E.R. fame even stars in this film alongside Mario Van Peebles.  This film is a reminder of how simple life was in the 80s and how easy it was to make films that appeal to a culture.,1052179200,3,449,4.174418604651163
1830360,5,B00008973D,"Oh baby, this is the one.  An incredibly phony rags to riches rap movie complete with all jewish screenwriters and director, Mario Van Peebles sportin' a Jheri curl, old white people getting down....man this movie is a CLASSIC!!!  This is the Star Wars of cheesy mid-80s rap movies.  I have seen this movie over 100 times and I pick up something new every time I watch it.  I can't recommend this movie enough, but if you ain't down with Cheese, don't bother.  This is not a movie for serious people.",1050451200,7,500,4.511111111111111
7980253,3,B00008973D,My cousin was in the movie. He passed away several years ago. It was filmed in the 80's... The  price of the video was more  expensive than I expected,1504656000,,150,4.137931034482759
7980254,5,B00008973D,"This movie was a good time in hiphop. Even though some of the acting was a lil cheesy, the music is actually pretty good. It has cameos from actual artists from the 80s. Eric Lasalle Rapping was the funniest thing I viewed all week! This is a movie that will een hae the little kids rapping to it!",1473638400,,297,4.137931034482759
7980255,1,B00008973D,Worst hip hop movie I've ever seen. Not even worth renting on Netflix.,1453852800,,70,4.461538461538462

7980257,5,B00008973D,Nothing like a classic 80s movie about pop culture. Well worth the time & movie.,1411430400,,80,4.4
7980258,5,B00008973D,"This movie is ""classic.""  I saw it originally as a double feature with THE LAST DRAGON - which is all you need to know.  This is another from the CANNON 80's cash grabs.  Just like BREAKIN', they tried to take another emerging fad (hip hop) and turn it in to a rags to riches tale from the streets.  This is the pinnacle of bad 80's cheese.  I laugh so hard every time I watch it, and always pick up something I missed.

When you watch these again 20+ years later, you start to realize that the CANNON guys were on to something bigger than they get credit for..  No matter how these movies were received or reviewed at the time, the sheer entertainment value holds up, for repeated viewings.  These were movies that were made by people who love movies.  By guys who were just happy to be making, writing, or starring in a movie.  You can't say that about some of the big budget stuff.

That said, Mario Van Peebles, Eriq LaSalle, Kadeem Hardison are all recognizable actors, who throw themselves in to this.  It is amazing that Ice-T, after this and BREAKIN 2', ever had any credibility as a hip hop artist, though he is a blast to watch.  This is the movie you get your friends together, grab a few drinks, and let it loose.  Questionable acting, over-acting, and under-acting.  Rhymes that sound like they were written by a couple old jewish guys (and they were) are delivered 80's style stiff, and they are about mundane topics, like the color YELLOW.  Even the supporting cast (including senior citizens) get in to the act during the credits.  I love this movie. IT IS SO MUCH FUN! As child of the 80's, this is one of those movies to cherish.  It is a great representative of the movies that were churned out - and the best example of CANNON that I think exists.  It is a great snap shot to that time, and will bring back memories.  The nostalgia is worth the price alone.  I wish they still made movies like this - low budget movies made with no stress and a lot of fun - instead of constantly being bombarded with big budget stuff you can hardly sit through.  In THAT way, this movie puts stuff like TRANSFORMERS to shame.  It is infinitely more entertaining than crap like that.

I'll say it again - the CANNON movies are sheer entertainment, and I think in many cases for us children of the 80's they hold up well.",1407974400,,2323,4.373831775700935
7980259,5,B00008973D,"if you are from the 80's,you would love this movie! Has singing and Music from kids to adults singing and rapping with no foul language...I recommend this movie to all and any age There's a good message in the movie as well",1387324800,,223,4.333333333333333
7980260,5,B00008973D,"I got this movie because I absolutely love this ""Original type rap! This is where it all started, fun upbeat rapping throughout the flick was great just like I remember when I first saw it on the new cable TV system.  Although is is a bit campy on the acting (to say the least? :-D), but still the songs  make it highly enjoyable.  Look for the cameo of the the- undiscovered-yet Iced-T doing some early rappin in it too.",1366588800,,421,4.30379746835443
7980261,1,B00008973D,"If you are like me and occasionally look for entertainment to bring you a sense of nostalgia...this is NOT the answer. I find it difficult to believe I even enjoyed this as a kid. Horrible acting, ridiculous story line and embarrassing dancing and rapping. I want my hour and a half back!!!",1279843200,,290,4.596153846153846
7980262,1,B00008973D,"I have never heard of this movie before and I regret spending an hour and 33 minutes of my time watching it yesterday. ""Rappin' has to be the cheesiest, most boring film ever made in the 1980's. Imagine how surprised I was to discover that this movie was filmed in Pittsburgh. A lame movie filmed in a lame city! I can't even remember the last time I had seen so many white people up on the Hill District where the movie took place- they're actually terrified to go up there. The only good thing about the movie was Mario Van Peebles. He was totally hot with those bulging biceps and those tight jeans. OOOO WEEEEE! Other than that this movie really sucks and none of the characters had any real rap skills. This movie isn't even worth watching. Not even Mario's hot looks could save it. Skip at all costs.",1133654400,3,806,4.38
