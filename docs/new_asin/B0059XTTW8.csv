4620932,3,B0059XTTW8,"I saw this new movie, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" without having read John le Carre's novel on which it is based or without seeing the previous adaptations of the book. The details of the plot proved difficult to follow, and I was quickly confused. The manner of the presentation, with many flash-backs, did not make understanding any easier.

There are positive things about the film as well. The movie captures the atmosphere and the spirit of palpable tension in the Cold War era of the early 1970's through its portrayal of tough, yet beaureaucratic espionage agents, out of the way hotels and homes, high glamor, and violence. The settings in London, Budapest, and Russia are shown effectively and realistically.  Gary Oldman gives a strong performance of the intelligent, tight-lipped and perceptive George Smiley as the lead character.

The story involves a Soviet mole who is placed in the upper reaches of British intelligence. The movie opens well as a British agent is ordered to Hungary to receive the name of the mole from a high-placed official. The mole, however, leaks the plan to the Soviets and the agent meets his death. George Smiley, who had earlier been fired, is recalled to service to learn the identity of the mole. The film moves well, for its 130 minute duration, and individual scenes are good. But the story, and the manner in which Smiley uncovers the turncoat, eluded me.

My understanding is that the movie greatly compressed and changed le Carre's novel. Even though the movie is lengthy, essential elements of the story were cut. The movie probably will be best appreciated by viewers who have read and enjoyed le Carre's novel because they will have some prior understanding of the story and where it is going. A movie should stand on its own, however, and be intelligible to viewers who have not read the book on which it is based. Although there was a good deal to like in this film, it left me unconvinced and bewildered.

4620933,4,B0059XTTW8,"Gary Oldman heads an All-Star cast in this interesting spy thriller based on a novel of the same name.  The time is the mid to late 1960's at the height of the Cold War.  The Brits and the Soviets had agents infiltrating each other's country and even their intelligence agency.  George Smiley (Oldman) and his boss known only as Control (John Hurt) are dismissed from MI-6 for spending too much time looking for a spy within their ranks.  After Control dies mysteriously in bed, Smiley is returned to service by the Home Secretary to pursue the potential of a double agent within their ranks.

Control had assigned possible targets as chess pieces and gave them the individual code names of the title.  There is very little in the way of action in the film although there are a few brutal torture scenes and violent deaths.  The action is all in the byplay between the characters.  The potential double agent include high ranking officials within MI-6 including Bland (Ciaran Hinds), Haydon (Colin Firth), Alleline (Toby Jones) and Smiley himself.  Smiley enlists the help of a  couple trusted compatriots including Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) and a wild card agent played by Tom Hardy.

Clues as to who the agent might be are few and far between and it is sometimes difficult to keep up with what is going on due to the nomenclature and British accents, but it's fun to try.  There are numerous scenes of silence as Smiley reflects on past events in an effort to tie everything together.  I couldn't help but think of Oldman's performance as Sid Vicious in ""Sid and Nancy"" (1986) where he played the obnoxious, profane drugged out rock star.  A completely different character from this thoughtful, political, cautious and quiet secret agent bureaucrat.  In the end, this is his movie.  His performance is terrific.

Blu ray update:  This 1080P disc is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio nearly the same as the theatrical production.  For those grainophiles, the transfer might be bothersome, but for me it is exactly as I remember in the theater.  This includes the bleak, brownish and smokey coloring.  Just like the filmmakers intended.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is exemplary.  The hushed, soft voices are clear and concise.  Really well done.",1326067200,6,2255,4.873684210526315
4620934,2,B0059XTTW8,"First, I am a person that prefers a good, compelling plot over a movie with big explosions. I just don't bother with those type of movies anymore unless action is truly integral to a good story. I knew going in that this was not a action flick and I had an idea of the gist of the plot.....and was looking forward to a good spy story but I didn't get it.

This movie is loaded with talent but for myself it failed because 1) it was confusing/difficult to follow, and 2) there is NO character development. I got to the point where at times when I seemed to be a bit lost trying to figure out who's the good or bad guy, then after an hour or more I just didn't care one way or the other. Again, great actors, great photography, and a cerebral plot - a combo which should have produced a memorable 2 hour film. At the very end I simply could care less who was the mole, or why, and I was just happy it finally ended. During the movie I said to myself, perhaps this is the type of movie that needs to be watched twice to fully appreciate the nuances. However, when I left the theatre I simply said to myself, that that was a few hours of my life I won't be getting back. Sad, because I am a huge movie fan but in the past 10 years I have had to carefully pick and choose from the fluff that hollywood turns out. I am a huge fan of TCM which shows all the classic movies from the 20's to the 60's and I do love a good cold war flick.

I have scoured reviews for this movie and found that most seemingly intelligent reviewers fell into either the, Loved It, or Waste of Time, category with few in between. For my rating I was trying to be fair and objective but sadly I can only give it 2 stars - I was going to give it 3 but I just can't, I didn't enjoy it, and didn't care about any of the characters one way or the other. Take this with a grain of salt, you may love it, or you may be bored to tears watching all this talent go to waste. However, I do have a desire to see the original version/series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy-with-Alec-Guiness/dp/B005DXCO94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with Alec Guiness</a>&nbsp;which is over twice as long, reported to have deep character development, and has stood the test of time.",1325980800,11,2319,4.390697674418605
4620935,5,B0059XTTW8,"""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a well-executed adaptation of John Le Carre's classic espionage novel of the Cold War, with a first-rate cast, a haunting atmosphere, and a compelling narrative.

""Tinker"" goes right to work.  The opening sequence has field agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on an off-the-books mission to Hungary for the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, known as Control (John Hurt).  Control suspects a mole within the upper reaches of the Service, and asks Prideaux to send back a codeword identifying the spy, using the children's nursery rhyme.  The mission is compromised, Priddeaux is shot, and Control and his deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are fired.

A restless Smiley is recalled to duty by a senior civil servant to investigate some unfinished business involving Ricki Tarr (a blonde Tom Hardy), a field agent who claims to know a vital Soviet secret and who has gone off the grid.  With the assistance of Tarr's desk officer, the young Peter Guillam (an astonishingly good Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley quietly renews the search for the mole.  Some old-fashioned detecting leads Smiley and Guillam down a thin trail of clues to four suspects and a fateful confrontation at a house in London.

Although only two hours long, ""Tinker"" manages to work in the key elements from a long novel, and gets some terrific work from the cast, especially Gary Oldman as Smiley, a weary Cold War veteran whose long brooding silences speak volumes.  The 1970's setting of the novel is evoked in detail with hair and clothing fashions, music, and technical props such as typewriters, old-fashioned teletypes, and reel-to-reel tape recorders.  The pacing of the story keeps the suspense alive to the end.

The inevitable comparison is with the superb BBC TV mini-series of the late 1970's starring Alec Guinness as Smiley.  It is a weakness of the movie that at just two hours, it lacks the time to properly introduce the many characters or the period to a modern audience who may not have experienced the Cold War.  There isn't a lot of exposition in the movie, and this reviewer, who was very familiar with the novel and the mini-series, suspects some viewers may have trouble following the story.

""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is highly recommended as an excellent and atmospheric spy drama.",1325894400,190,2327,5.04177545691906
4620936,4,B0059XTTW8,"if you are watching this film for the characterizations, the period, the overall theme and so forth, like I was, then you will like this.  if you are solely watching for plot, which many people who watch spy movies do, then you might not.  it is a very convoluted plot and very compressed to fit within the time frame. basically, when george smiley (gary oldman), a senior spymaster, is thrown out of British Intelligence because of an operation gone wrong, there is no doubt in my mind that he will be back, that he will figure out everything. essentially he has to find the mole in British Intelligence (very loosely based on spy Kim Philbin from this Cold War era, who did end up relocated in Russia).

what i was enjoying was the performance Gary Oldman was giving.  I would imagine this is the way a spy really is.  They are not at all glamorous.  They were nerdy and studious in school. They got used to spending time alone and that has never changed. They are nondescript and almost fade back into the wallpaper or paint in a room. most importantly, they are always thinking. and thinking.  and thinking.  watching too of course but thinking out moves in their heads and going backwards and forwards with different permutations.  it may take them awhile to speak because they have to have thought something through before they have anything to say.  gary oldman captures this perfectly.  he is a late middle age spy and he has survived that long because he is very careful and very thoughtful. he does have a gun but it is something he takes out only when strictly necessary and it is the only logical choice left.

i did see the late alec guinness's performance as this same character. this is a tough choice.  they are both great actors. i would probably give the edge to Oldman. He especially has the voice down perfectly, just the most casual, laid back, milquetoast voice imaginable.

the rest of the production and actors are all quite good.  however, the main virtue to the show is Gary Oldman.

4620937,2,B0059XTTW8,"There was much to be excited about when it came to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It may have been a remake, but it also featured the likes of Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, and Mark Strong in a spy movie. Odds are that you're a fan of one of those actors and who doesn't love a film about spies? Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy are what initially attracted me to the project and Mark Strong was just a pleasant surprise, so the anticipation was very high. Unfortunately, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is basically a waste of two hours.

A press screening for this was held nearly three weeks before the film's limited release date. Everyone who attended was handed what was referred to as a ""cheat sheet,"" which not only helped describe the film but also went into detail about ""The Circus"" along with definitions of code names and terms that were used throughout the film. This is being mentioned because unless you've read the book, have seen the original 1979 film, or receive this ""cheat sheet"" and go over it in great detail then you will more than likely be lost throughout most of the film. Five years ago, Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly released a film called Southland Tales. The unusual thing about it was that the movie was actually episodes 4-6 while a prequel graphic novel contained episodes 1-3. It's an interesting approach that deserves credit for trying something different, but the bottom line is that most people won't and don't read up on a film before it's released.

With that said, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy isn't completely incomprehensible. You still know what's going on, but you just don't care. It's a very slow moving film that relies on dialogue more than anything to tell the story. Its nonlinear sense of storytelling isn't a smooth transition and is a bit difficult to keep track of at times. Didn't this character die earlier? Wasn't he working for somebody else like five minutes ago? Wait wait wait...WHAT? Who the HELL is that guy? These are the types of questions you'll probably be asking yourself. The majority of the characters seem very similar to one another and even share similar hairstyles. So everyone basically comes off as old, bitter people working for the government that are paranoid about a mole and probably should have retired ten years ago, which is kind of odd since the film revolves around retired agents attempting to be pulled back into the service.

Gary Oldman puts in a fascinating performance as George Smiley, but it fails in comparison to most of the other film characters he's known for. Smiley doesn't even speak for a good while (Oldman is probably shown on screen for at least a good ten to fifteen minutes before he actually says anything) and the fact that Oldman went through such precise detail just to pick out the appropriate pair of glasses for the character is admirable. He has one magnificent scene in the film, which occurs in his office with Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he tells the story of how Karla never returned his engraved lighter. It's easily the best scene in the film. Tom Hardy is also fairly fantastic in his role as he shows quite a bit of emotion in the film and Mark Strong offers the type of solid performance you'd expect from the English actor.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy does have a few redeeming qualities that mostly lie within the performances of Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy. Its decorative setting and use of unique perspective automatically makes the film appealing to the eye. The film is really bland the majority of the time though and is extremely uneventful. Even when something violent does occur, it fades into obscurity rather quickly and is covered up by the gargantuan amounts of jargon that's constantly regurgitated amongst everyone on-screen. So despite a few semi-decent performances and an experience that's at least visually intriguing, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a thriller that never really gets thrilling. Your constant uphill battle to stay awake until the film ends is far more exhilarating.",1325808000,17,4028,4.816473988439307
4620938,4,B0059XTTW8,"The first thing that struck me watching this film set in the 1970s is how much it looked like a movie made in the 1970s. The replication of the look of a 70s film is an impressive and fairly subtle touch in settling the audience into the atmosphere of the film. The performances are top notch and it's a pleasure watching so many fine actors ply their craft so well. The difficulty of condensing a complex story into a two hour film, though, leaves viewers who are unfamiliar with the details of the story either because they have never read it or, in my case, read it so long ago as to remember nothing other than that is was good adrift a bit too much to be completely satisfied. But I doubt it could have been any better and still remained at a cineplex friendly length.",1325721600,2,773,4.301369863013699
4620939,3,B0059XTTW8,"As a work of film craft, its very well done. The acting, the direction, the script and the visuals are all of the very highest order. Its a technical work of a very high order. I had my doubts going in as to how they could compress such a large work effectively into the limits of a single film. But they did it very well. The script is almost a work of art in terms of pushing maximum story and plot in a minimum time.

But is this a good or great film. Probably not. For the story to work (in my opinion), the viewer has to care about the suspects and more importantly the viewer has to believe that none of these men could possibly be the mole until shown that one is the mole. But the characters are basically voids or ciphers. We don't know them really at all. And because we don't know them, it makes little difference to the audience which of them is guilty in the end.

The biggest actual flaw in the film is toward the end where the mole is given an opportunity to explain himself....and effectively doesn't. He throws out a couple brief lines about asthetics. Realism aside, that explaination is the payoff to the detective story in the film. The payoff in this case is missing. The audience is presented with a guilty character who they care little about who can't even explain his actions. Not a great way to end the film. The payoff is something that the TV version got right.

The cinematography is by the nature of the work confused. The story (the novel) is really a 1950s story set in the 1970s. The film really can't recreate either so it provides a sort of lost-in-time mixed up version that combines modern behavior with old machines serving as set dressing. They capture a sort of state of decay in the immediate surroundings but they never really manage to capture the state of decay in the broader society of either the 1950s or the 1970s which is of course important to the story in terms of the motivations of the mole.

The film will work as a complex detective yarn for some. It will work better for those who saw the earlier television version and probably best of all for those who have read the book. The more the viewer knows about the story, the less the flaws of the film will matter. The more known about the characters going in, the less the lack of character development among the mole suspects will matter.",1325462400,9,2343,4.379310344827586
4620940,4,B0059XTTW8,"Probably like a lot of modern viewers, I had heard of but not read this book, nor seen the BBC TV series - Both were issued in the 1970's.

I did though read a few summaries, knew that it was loosely based on the hunt for British turncoat spy Kim Philby, and went into the movie understanding that it requires very careful attention to keep up with the involved plot.  Seeing it cold, I still thought it was great, with terific performances by many decorated actors throughout the movie, and Gary Oldman is fantastic in the lead.  In some ways, if like me you see it without knowing the story first, his character is done in a way that helps take you into the story, as he barely says anything in the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie and just seems to be watching what all is going on.  By the end, he has transformed into a strong character that has figured out the whole scheme.

While I loved the movie, even without having read the book to know the full story, it felt like the plot was overly compressed to fit within 2 hours.  I watched it intently, but there were still a couple of developments in the plot, as done in the movie, that seemed like huge leaps.  Hopefully there will someday be a director's cut that fleshes the movie out a little better.

One viewing tip, courtesy of the Seattle Times movie reviewer - the many flashbacks can sometimes be confusing, but one way to help keep them straight is the glasses worn by Gary Oldman.  He buys a new pair at the start of the movie, so the flashbacks show him with his old glasses - for the current events, he is wearing the new ones.

Postscript:
-----------

With the release of the movie on dvd and cable, many reviewers have now complained that the show is slow and boring. This is definitely not an action movie.  If you're looking for the latest James Bond type flick, this movie is not for you.

On the other hand, director Tomas Alfredson (and John Le Carre in the book) probably assumed that the viewer would understand that this is a story of the very highest stakes -  As mentioned above, it is widely acknowledged to be a fictionalized account of the hunt for British turncoat spy Kim Philby.  Philby and his fellow Cambridge spies turned over vast amounts of classified British and US atomic and military information to the Soviets during the height of the Cold War.  Philby also later admitted providing the Soviets with the names of hundreds of Western agents during his long years as a Communist mole, and many of those betrayed were captured and tortured or killed by the KGB.  Le Carre could rightfully assume his readers in the Cold War era recognized the stakes involved without expressly stating such.  Alfredson apparently assumed the same for the movie, as nothing was added to the script to make this clear for modern viewers.  Personally, I think that was a reasonable approach, as it is apparent that the mole is at the highest level of British security, but it is clear from all of the reviews here that find the movie boring, many viewers feel otherwise.

By the way, while the British eventually confirmed he was a Communist spy, Philby actually escaped to the Soviet Union before he could be prosecuted and was later honored on a Russian postage stamp....",1325030400,240,3250,4.513651877133106
4620941,3,B0059XTTW8,"Just to be clear. I was impressed with the film, its casting, and its direction. And it's impossible to say how I would have reacted if I had come to it fresh, but I didn't, and therefore I can only judge it as I found it, which is as a well made,skilfully acted and directed spy thriller, some way short of the masterpiece which other critics have claimed it as. I never really suspended my disbelief. First of all I applaud Alfredson(director of Let The Right One In) for choosing this subject. The outsider's perspective on British themes,here the subject of spying, treachery,the Cold War. Second,his utilisation of the best of British actors to play the roles and especially Gary Oldman. Thirdly,the compression of the vast material of le Carre's Tinker,Tailor into a two hour film,like ""stuffing an elephant into a telephone booth"".I prefer films which explore character and are well plotted,based on reality rather than myth,superheroes,fantasy,the crashbangwallop school of cinema. We are in a grey world of bureaucracy and idealogical struggles,the battle of wits,in a world of human foibles,mistrust,weaknesses. Smiley(Oldman) is brought back out of retirement to track down a traitor in the MI6,facing an adversary as brilliant and inscrutable as himself. Le Carre worked as an operative in the 50s and 60s and his identity was betrayed to the Soviets by the mole Philby,like the one in the film. The mole's option of betrayal is based on ""an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one"",the decline of Empire and anti-Americanism. Hurt,Cumberbatch,Firth and Strong all play pivotal roles.

The cinematography reflects well the smoky,claustrophobic,downbeat 70s. We are in a world that's in decline,a world that's passing away,with its drab interiors, filing cabinets,teletexes. The security services are managing decline and denial. Oldman is excellent by understating his performance,avoiding tics,Guinness-imitations, with a hint of menace and steel,not weakened by his wife's adultery,but using it like a chess piece in the game of ruthlessness. I do feel the first 15 minutes put the new viewer at a loss as to what was going on,wonder who half the people are, what their relationship is to each other,what their motivation is. Too much material gets crammed in:Ricki Tarr and the Russian woman,Smiley and Karla,Jim Prideux in a caravan at a prep school with overweight boy. Alfredson has to juggle many balls in the air,using heroic compression via flash back. However the characters aren't as fully developed as in the TV series so their relationships,although complex were more clear. You need the extended running time of the TV series or previous knowledge of the book to fully grasp the story. At the end of it, I found that I liked it, but not as much as I had expected to. The book,TV and film are different mediums and give different experiences. Somehow,here there was a lack of dramatic tension and the unmasking of the mole is an anti-climax. Go and see the TV series and Guinness and then decide how potential moles only have a bit part,the lack of emotional impact at the end. This is a light sketch not a finished artefact.",1316822400,42,3150,5.069364161849711

He looks 49 playing a retiree. Peter Guillam looks like he should be playing football at Jim Prideaux's school.

I hated the gratuitous comment about the Americans having had Karla's fingernails pulled out. This is virtue-signalling on the part of the writer.

I also agree with the 1-star comments, though, in that the film's pace is the very definition of the word ""lugubrious"". I suppose that's why my rating is somewhere in the middle.

There are a few things that make watching this more enjoyable. For instance, don't watch this at night, unless you're having trouble sleeping because the slow pace and the dull color palette will knock you right out. Someone else here said the same and I concur.

It also really helps if 1) you've read the book and 2) if you were actually alive in the 70's to know that they got the clothes and the paranoia and the tensions between the West and the Soviet Union dead on. I was a small child in the 70's, but I remember how things were, then. So, I have to give the film points for accuracy.

The film moves along with very hard cuts between scenes and places, oftentime. So, if you don't already know the general story, you're going to be very confused and the whole thing is going to seem extremely disjointed.

I haven't yet seen the Guiness mini-series, so I have nothing to compare this latest film to. I assume Guiness is better than Oldman because, hey, it's Obi-Wan. Even Vader couldn't beat him. But, Oldman gave a very good -- and unusually restrained -- performance. All the acting was good. The problem wasn't there, it was with the storytelling. They did a great disservice to younger people who might have become new LeCarre fans through this remake because the didn't really explain things enough.

Without knowing a clear reason for all the spying, it was hard to care who was doing it.  It was a who-done-it without the motive for the crime, which made the whole movie just seem incomplete and incohesive.

""There are two movies of Tinker ,Tailor; a later one with Gary Oldman as Smiley which is very well done and is about two hours in length and then this PBS series with Sir Alec Guinness which is the most superb capture of the John Le Carre' book.  This is the gold standard.  The subtlety of the book can be captured in this more lengthy treatment.  If you are a Le Carre' fan, this is the one you have to have.  I was so taken with the original PBS production that I taped it on VHS even though it was grainy and snowy because of the poor reception where I lived (no cable back then).  I finally disposed of those tapes when the DVD came available.  Enough cannot be said for the portrayals of the various characters by a superb cast and the book jumps out at you as you watch it.  Remember, also that ""Smiley's People"" another DVD is a follow on to this story and stars Sir Alec as well.
  You can have them both and still have great experiences watching them.  This is well acted and presented.  The story partakes of longer treatment and that is what makes the PBS production superior.  But superior to a superior film in this two hour production.",1487980800,,1218,4.247826086956522

The primary thing that struck me on this viewing was how well the screenwriters and director captured the flavor of a John le Carr novel.  Le Carr is not casual reading. Any devotee will tell you that the reader must concentrate fully and that a casual phrase in a sentence can be important to comprehending a complex detail in the plot's development.

Likewise, this film is demanding, requiring the the viewer's complete focus. The elegant way in which the story line is developed and the film is edited, involves frequent shifts of foreshadowing and flashback, much the way a Le Carr narrative is structured. This challenges the viewer to stay engaged. But on repeated viewing, one begins to follow the internal logic of film's construction and then other distinctive features come into focus, such as the outstanding filmography, superb acting, and the wonderfully atmospheric score by Alberto Iglesias.

An additional word about the screenplay. No two-hour film can capture the breadth and fine detail of a Le Carr novel. The writers of this film had a huge challenge to adapt the author's rich prose, complex plot and Dickensian characterizations for cinema. Their objective could only be to retain the essence of the book's story line within the context of its philosophical themes. This they have accomplished artfully. Together with the fine casting and acting throughout, I believe this film will eventually be recognized as the most successful adaptation of a Le Carr novel.",1477872000,15,1588,4.981132075471698

4621247,4,B0059XTTW8,"This is a well made movie. Well acted, well directed, with a great script. It's a spy movie in which a retired spy sets out to uncover a mole in the British intelligence agency. Though the characters, and story are fantastic, the film is very slow. Normally this wouldn't be a problem for me, but I found that the payoff wasn't enough to justify the pace. There are two ways you can approach a finding-the-mole story. One, you give the viewer crumbs, so that the audience can participate in the story. Everyone tries to put the clues together and are excited when they guess the mole right, and are surprised when they guess the mole wrong. Two, you show the viewer a procedural on how to draw out the mole, so that the audience feels like they are learning something clever. ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" takes the latter approach. But the approach is a little confusing (mainly due to the flashback scenes) and too detailed, so when the mole is revealed, there is an apathy felt by the viewer because they were never fully engaged in the mystery.

The real draw to this movie is just the performances--especially Gary Oldman and Benedict Cumberbatch--which are very engaging. The mundane take on the spy world is also sort of interesting. It makes espionage seem very much like a job, and less like an EXTREME adventure as portrayed in the Bond films or ""Mission Impossible"" films. Overall, definitely worth the watch, but tailor your expectations.",1474329600,4,1448,4.746031746031746

And I remember when Philby's defection became public, later on.

Now, I am usually one to moan that a film is never as good as the authors work, yet I feel this version of TTSS was done very well. Don't expect Bond or the Man from UNCLE because that is fantasy. Britain did have a traitor in her midst (Philby) and I think this is how that deception would have gone.

I have read the criticism that Oldman is no Alec Guiness. Well how could he be in a 2 hr movie adaptation. Sir Alex had 10 hours in the 1982 tv series.

The details in the book and the original series are what make those worth reading and seeing. While Gary Oldman plays a typically enigmatic Smiley, he does not capture the complexity of the spy Smiley. Good effort and interesting visual story telling, but if I had not read the book and seen the original BBC series, the story would make no sense. Also, the portrayal of Peter Guillame as gay, while stylish and current, departs too much from the original story by Le Carre.

Even more dialog between characters or narration to help the viewer understand the significance (if any) of certain scenes would have been fine. But instead there were many scenes that seemed pointless or just drawn out. This did not feel like an exciting spy story of a man trying to find a CIA mole, but instead a very boring mystery involving interviews and a lot of thought back to how coworkers acted or reacted to certain past events. It was like an attempt to portray stream-of-consciousness in film, which, if that was the reasoning behind the scene construction, was very ineffective. I cannot recommend this film at all, despite the top-notch actors in the film.

There was a very strong push by communists to take over the government in England and make it a communist country. And this movie has ties to that movement. Some great acting, dialogue, sets, scenes.. It's a keeper. Some won't like the pace and the time shifts (hard to catch the first time around).

4621898,4,B0059XTTW8,"""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is a 2011 film adaptation of John Le Carr&eacute;'s classic spy novel of the same name. It's a tense, taught espionage thriller that preserves the essence of Le Carr&eacute;'s superb book. I found it  very entertaining from beginning to end.

It is the early 1970s, right at the height of the Cold War. ""Control,"" the head of the British Foreign Intelligence service (MI6),  suspects there is a Soviet mole at the very top of ""The Circus"" (as MI6 is affectionately called). ""Control"" sends one of his most trusted agents into Hungary to meet with a foreign agent who he believes can confirm his suspicions. However, ""Control's"" agent runs afoul of a KGB ambush...

As a result, ""Control"" and his right-hand man, George Smiley, are forced out of the Circus and into retirement. Rumors persist, however, that the suspected mole in ""The Circus"" is still active. George Smiley is recalled to duty and tasked with unmasking the identity of the Soviet operative who's working inside ""The Circus"" and selling state secrets to the enemy.

""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" stars Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, John Hurt, Tom Hardy, and several other well known character actors, all of whom perform brilliantly in this film. Oldman, Cumberbatch, and Hardy are especially noteworthy  as George Smiley, Peter Guillam, ad Ricki Tarr, respectively. Oldman received a Best Actor Academy Awatrd nomination for his performance.

""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is not a particularly fast-moving film, but the pace never flags, and I never lost interest in any part of the story. Director Tomas Alfredson and writers Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan do an excellent job of keeping the film tense and taught throughout its 2 hour,8 minute run time. Because Le Carr&eacute;'s novel is so very complex, certain aspects of the novel had to be condensed, and certain of Le Carr&eacute;'s characters made composites, in order to create a film of reasonable length that still remained faithful to the book. Alfredson, O'Connor, and Strtaughan were very successful in their efforts in this regard.

""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is a film that never fails to entertain me whenever I watch it. Highly recommended.",1433808000,,2238,5.146005509641873

4621933,1,B0059XTTW8,"The best I can say about this movie version of the story is that it is okay.  Extremely okay.  And if that seems like damning with faint praise, it is.

Perhaps my problem with it is that I've seen and loved the televised mini-series starring Alec Guinness who is, it must be said, the very embodiment of George Smiley.  Having been dazzled by that wonderful series, the movie strikes me as a pale imitation.

Beyond the absence of Guinness's performance, this version fails to establish the atmosphere that permeated the original, nor do any of the stars quite get their characters right, either overacting or underacting.  In fact, it's a disappointment on pretty much every level.

Given the brilliance of the TV version, it's hard to understand why anyone would  think a movie would be a good idea.  It certainly falls far short of doing justice to Le Carre's wonderful book, and he really deserves an apology from those who did this to it.

If you're considering spending money on this, I would suggest that you consider spending more and getting the Alec Guinness version.  It is several hours long and every minute is gripping.",1432425600,2,1134,4.764102564102564

The cast of the remake is splendid (in spite of Benedict Cumberbatch's Justin-Bieber wig) and Mark Strong gets a chance to show he can do nuance in character. This director also favors the long  tracking shot, and keeps us at a distance. He treats closeups as if they cost CGI money. They don't, but they do involve us deeper in the film. I also missed Ian Richardson's silky Bill Haydon, who mutters ""stupid bloody cabaret"" at one of Percy's meetings. The cast in this version all work between the lines. They have to, because the script is as sparing of dialogue as it is of emotion. Make no mistake, emotions are really there in this story, because Le Carre' put them there. A line like ""Yes, that was good of you,"" reverberates when Guiness says it to Haydon. ""I hate America deeply,"" Bill says, and it stings.

4622158,2,B0059XTTW8,"I think this must be very much a case of ""you have to have read the book"".
(And even then I very much suspect you might be disappointed at the disordered treatment it gets here in this movie.)

 Great cast, performances are all good, the art direction is suitably bleak in keeping with the prevalent mood of what became known as ""The Cold War"", BUT as it stands and for any newcomer, the movie itself is almost impossible to fathom just what the hell is really going on at any given moment.

There is little logical development of the narrative, and scenes are intercut with such little regard for continuity as to suggest the film might have been edited with the aid of a lawnmower.
You are never quite sure if it's meant to be a flashback, or current, or even imaginary....and such changes happen almost mid-scene, making it even harder to follow.
Chronological order this most certainly is NOT!

At THE most basic the plot seems to be concerned with identifying a long-suspected ""mole"" at the highest level in British Intelligence.
That much seems clear, but the motives, actions and relevance of the many and various characters are never made clear, and the convolutions of the plot rapidly become monumentally confusing.

So many characters are apparently playing ""footsie"" with the Russians, but only on a minor basis, in order to ....oh I don't know, but
even when the ""mole"" is finally revealed you're still not exactly sure just what he did, or how far he went, or who he was doing it to, or why.
(He's also apparently got a woman with a kid, a mistress he was ordered to seduce, ...and a boy on the side in his private life, ...not to mention a somewhat ambiguous relationship with his male spy-partner?)

Does it all matter anyway?
Well probably,  as I believe the book was a best-seller and it might have deserved a better treatment.

I watched it to the bitter end to see who the mole was I suppose, ...can't say I followed a lot of it though.
I did have to research Wikipedia next morning for a coherent plot summary, which certainly helped make some sense of the mis-matched bits I had seen.

However, if like me you have not actually read the Le Carr novel, and are intending to watch this movie then prepare to be majorly confused.",1421625600,,2248,4.5721393034825875
4622159,4,B0059XTTW8,"In an age of high tech espionage wizardry ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" might seem like a throwback to the old days. And it's true. It has more in common with ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" than it does the Bourne films. So, if your short on patience you might want to steer clear.

Here's the scoop. Set during the height of the cold war, MI6 is finally acknowledging that it has mole in its ranks. They need to clean house to help revitalize their standing with U.S. intelligence, so they bring George Smiley out of his forced retirement to help find the little rat.

This is a subtle, carefully paced film. The viewer needs to keep an eye open for just about everything. The smallest facial expression or misplaced word can be very telling in the plot. There is no slam bang here. It's a mixture of investigation, baiting and stealing files to see how various, previous events might shine a light on things. Smiley says as little as possible. As some have noted, the movie is twenty minutes old before he even utters his first words. He reads, looks and listens for the things which seem impossible to make sense of, but, in the end, it all pays off. As in Le Carre's ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" the intelligence community is depicted as a nasty place. Lines get blurred and the good/bad argument becomes senseless. It's difficult to hate the mole when he's exposed. He's just a miserable individual who's gotten tired of the stinking mess he's been involved in.

This is the third collaboration for screen writers Bridget O'Connor and Peter Staughan. I haven't read the source material but, judging what they came up with, they seem to have done a commendable job. It can't be easy to take a non-action, cerebral type story and make it work in a film. Luckily, all the actors are veterans, and help pull this off. Director Tomas Alfredson, who is best known on this side of the pond for his ""Let the Right One In,"" does a stand up job. Yes. It IS deliberately paced and might feel slow to many viewers. But he does a great job of framing his shots and getting the viewer to feel between the lines. He sets mood very well.

I do like the Guinness version much better, but the director and writers of this movie had to make difficult choices because of substantially more limited time and because it is 2011 when action rules the day.

On the whole, the director and writers did very well.  Some of their choices are quite good if not necessarily very consistent with LeCarre's novel.  I would give the movie 5 stars because it is intelligent and the performances are very good, but the final scenes were jarring to me.  They lost much of the personal nature of the betrayal, the punishment, and the ambivalent nature of Smiley's triumph.

Too bad it distracts the viewer from excellent performances by John Hurt and Gary Oldman.  Don't watch this film expecting lots of action.

I unfortunately caught the last two scenes prior to watching the movie so I already knew who the mole was. I found it significant that Haydon's character was bisexual. At least I think he was bisexual, rather than a closeted homosexual using female lovers as beards. When he asked that Smiley take care of a female lover, and then a male lover in the end, it appears that he was truly a bisexual.

Every casting choice there, as well as the acting, pitch perfect, including one of the lesser roles, Taffy or Tuffy, the buffoonish Circus stringer in Lisbon (changed to Istanbul in this latest version -- a bad sign. Whenever things slow down in a thriller today -- mention Istanbul. Thank you From Russia With Love).

Anyway: the edting's a mess. Whoever edited Fred Zinnemann's Day of the Jackal was badly needed here. Could have made it a good flick.

SPOILERS ALL THE WAY THROUGH

Bill Haydon is a complete non-character until he's revealed as the mole. How is that drama? To know nothing of the villain? Virtually nothing is asked of Colin Firth in this role, and he delivers. (Interestingly, that's the only area where the great BBC version might have gotten an A- instead of an A+. Roy Bland was never a serious suspect, and we didn't get enough of Haydon (Ian Richardson).)

Oldman is good but what he basically does is imitate Alec Guinness, though only adequately. (Not once, for example, does he, to great dramatic effect, remove or put on his eyeglasses.) The only good casting choice is Ricki Tarr; so many of the lesser characters are so far off (Jerry Westerby, for one, who was NOT manning the phones the night Jim Prideaux got shot). They changed the great Toby Esterhase to Toby Esterhouse. Why? And comparing whoever plays him to Bernard Hepton ... it's just not fair. Same with Connie Sacks, Alleline and Lacon. John Hurt is very very good in this version -- but no match for the original Control. (Alexander Knox). And Roy Bland in this version (Ciaran Hinds) -- does he say anything?

A mess.

Now, three years later, I finally got around to seeing it. I was immediately struck with confusion during the opening credits; while I understood the overarching issue (a mole in British Intelligence), the specifics were unclear. The protagonist, played by Gary Oldman, is called back to duty to investigate.

In this lead role, Oldman accomplishes an esoteric, theatrical suspense the borders on affectation. I wanted to like the character, but the vocal staccato and significant breaks in speech for effect were distracting. Rather than being a spy thriller, it felt like they were trying to act like a spy thriller. That difference left it feeling artificial and overly dramatic.

Tinker Tailor has an incredible score and cast. Colin Firth is an incredible character, and adds much depth to the movie. Overall, I found it to be too long, overly theatrical, and less thrilling than anticipated. Not a bad movie, but not one Ill be dying to see again.",1408320000,,1203,4.975124378109452

4622813,1,B0059XTTW8,"This has nothing on the TV series out through Acorn video and Oldman has nothing on Sr. Alec Guiness. The movie is way too short to effectively convey the plot of the book sufficiently.

Based on a John Le Carre novel taking place during the Cold War, this story is about a British intelligence agency whose top leadership was shaken up after a botched operation in Hungary the year before.  But an informer calls in to tell about a mole in the agency.  Sounds exciting, right?

Well, I wasn't expecting a James Bond movie with cheesecake girls, fancy gadgets, or exciting stunts.

But the 'quality without a name' simple failed to effervesce from the open bottle. I'm talking about the glue that binds it all together and makes you forget you're watching  a film production. The problem is with the material itself. It isn't well suited to be packed into a single setting of a few hours in a darkened theatre. The original story is exceedingly complex, and cerebral, fragile, frankly, and was rendered with extra-ordinary deftness by Le Carre. The version starring Sir Alec G wrestled it into a mini-series--and as good as it was--and it was better than this circumcised remake--it was still starved down to a somewhat skeletal version. That is not to say that the mini-series wasn't great. It was fabulous. But there are certain kinds of literary structures that simply don't translate so well into the audio-visual representation. One of the reasons why I love the new format of these extended modern series, such as Mad Men, or Downton Abbey, or Deadwood, is that they let a large, complicated story loom large. Sprawl. Breathe. So let's keep the big tales to the appropriate big format, please? Don't try to turn a 500 page novel into a short story. No amount of quality acting and stagecraft can make up the shortfall.",1405296000,2,1338,4.946666666666666

Director Tomas Alfredson did a brilliant job at portraying the dark and dismal setting of Cold War Europe and at maintaining a good pacing throughout the movie.  The cinematography by Hoyt Van Hoyteman is absolutely amazing, as impressive as his work on Let The Right One In.

Comparing a novel to its movie adaptation is problematic and adapting a long, complex novel into a two hour movie is understandably difficult.  In my opinion, this adaptation was an extremely difficult one that was executed very well.

I felt like I was watching a WWII episode of the Office at times with how much of the movie was nothing but people wandering around handling paperwork.

4623101,5,B0059XTTW8,"This a really great movie. But you have to pay attention to the details to enjoy and appreciate it. This is an intelligent movie. It's not your typical movie full of gratuitous violence and chase scenes. It's low-key, but for a purpose. I think it portrays very well the idea (perhaps not realistic) of the confusing world of spycraft, where you often don't know what's fact, what's fantasy, the often paranoid atmosphere, the grueling, occasionally exciting daily life of the spook.

I previously read the book, but it's been many years. I vaguely remember the plot from the book, and it seems the movie does not exactly follow the book. But it doesn't really matter. I think the movie correctly conveys the atmosphere in ways that a book cannot, and does not diverge significantly from the plot of the book.

Gary Oldman is great as George Smiley. Smiley is an aging British spymaster, previously forced into retirement years ago, along with other agents, when an operation went wrong, and agent Jim Prideaux was shot in Budapest. Retired, Smiley swims alongside other retirees in a local lake, watches soap operas on TV, and grows older.

Now, a British intelligence agent on the run (Ricki Tarr) alleges there is a mole within the intelligence services, based on what the Russian agent Irina told him, and Smiley is called back to investigate. Smiley picks Peter Guilliam (Benedict Cumberbatch) to help ferret out the mole.

The suspects are faces on chess pieces, left behind by the previous head of intelligence, ""Control"", who was forced to retire along with Smiley. The suspects are the new head of intelligence Percy Alleline (pugnacious Scot) and his allies Bill Haydon (upper crust English), Toby Esterhaze (east European), and Roy Bland (dark mooded English). Finally, Smiley himself is a suspect. Each suspect is quite different in mehhod and personality.

Behind the scenes is the Russian spymaster ""Karla"". Smiley tried to ""turn"" Karla decades in the past. Now Karla is fooling the British at their own game, with the British mole secretly passing along the British ""crown jewels"" in Alleline's ""Witchcraft"" operation that was supposedly getting secret Russian intelligence in exchange for ""chicken feed"", but has backfired. And now American intelligence may become compromised.

In this earlier and excellent production, all the characters are fully developed and you can really get into the story.  I guarantee that you will watch it twice through:  First time to learn the story line and second time to get all the details and nuances you missed first time around!  Having once gotten a good grounding in the tale, the newest effort with Gary Oldman makes a lot more sense and is more enjoyable.  I am now happy to own both versions of this ripping good yarn.

Subtle is one thing:  Not caring about any of the characters is something else.  The high ratings that I read here all seem to have one thing in common, and it's defending that characteristic of the movie.  It's a dramatization inspired by actual events?  But we're not told that anywhere in the film, so lacking a firm grasp of British Cold War history going in, we're what?  Supposed to be wowed because it's a famous book written by a famous author?

In this, Gary Oldman, edition they must endeavor to tell the same tale in only 2 hours and 8 minutes AND THEY DO.

Gary Oldman is one of the best actors who ever stepped in front of a camera. He makes it look so easy that maybe why he goes somewhat under the radar. Other actors great is Gary Oldman's average.

Gary Oldman does a poor impersonation of Alec Guiness and the director tries so hard to be esoteric it ends up being impenetrable & soporific.

Worse, this is a good example of the current cinematic fad of making the audio dynamic range either too soft to understand or punctuated by too-loud blasts of music & noise, so you're constantly adjusting the remote.

 The acting isn't bad, what there is of it, but the pace is glacial & LeCarre's wonderful characters get lost in the fog.",1393891200,,686,4.887931034482759

4623221,3,B0059XTTW8,"So let's begin by admitting that Gary Oldman is amazing when he's having toast; however, this retelling of an older tale is so slow, it takes effort to determine what is going on.  Time changes forward and back without notice... someone is alive; now dead; back alive again.. who was he?  Why is he dead again?  But it's not all bad, of course.  The acting, while glacially slow is spot-on. Probably because Oldman is backed up by a host of British elite (Benedict Cumberbatch of Sherlock; Colin Firth of The King's Speech, etc.).  It is a decent spy yarn; it is Cold War stuff; there is lots of smoking, ala, Mad Men, so, we've got that going for us but drinking even good Scotch can make you lose your taste for it if you drink it too long and too slow.  My final note, and the most aggravating for me is that there are movies where the bad guy could be any of the suspects and you don't know until the final moments; this movie is like that but seriously, the bad guy could be ANY of the suspects without changing the movie one iota.  There is no ""AHA!"" moment, only an, ""Oh, OK""",1393545600,3,1082,4.2745098039215685

I don't understand the need to remake it but I don't get the passion the brits had for the series when it came out. I watched a couple of episodes from the original and to be honest I found it a bit boring. Ive also tried reading John Le Carre novels years ago and found it tedious and slow.

The story is about the old spy days of the Cold War and the game between the brits and the russians. Apparently there is a mole among the brits top tier and no one believes them. George Smiley was forced into retirement when his old boss Control was forced out after a mistake. The mistake had to do with an agent getting injured when he was sent to Russia to find out who the mole was. Theres four likely suspects and they all seem plausible. No one can be trusted but Smiley because he was retired. In the end it turns out to be his wifes old lover. I kind of knew it was going to be him since Colin Firth played that role. You figure since all the other guys were no names they wouldnt give such a juicy role to one of them. Thats a problem with modern movies, meaty roles go to the big names. Overall the movie was well adapted but its labeled as a spy thriller but it didn't thrill. It was more a drole mystery for those that feels nostalgia for that period. I dont.

To make matters even better, the time sequence of scenes is not linear and flashbacks are not always identifiable unless you keep track of who is dead and which characters are still trying to stay alive.

4623430,4,B0059XTTW8,"I can't believe this only has a 3 star average rating. It's a brilliant spy story and period piece that spans part of the cold war. It's the UK vs the USSR. It's slow paced, yes, but it's so intriguing that you're sucked into the movie, not bored! Is it too complex? That's debatable but I love the fact that it is actually complex and intelligent. Great atmosphere, great acting, great actors and beautifully filmed. It feels very much like a true to life spy scenario, where there are no black and white, good and bad guys in this devious and malicious spy game of power and control.

The only possible negative to this movie is that becuase it is so complex and perplexing, you can easily get lost if you don't pause to think about it (quite literally) or just be able to handle the plot as it runs. If you like films for escapeism and switching your mind off, then you probably won't like this but if you don't mind using your brain (a lot) when watching a movie and become consequently stimulated, then this is for you.

Basic plot: it's spy vs spy, UK vs USSR (not through James Bond style action but rather through intel gathering and undercover agents), but who do you trust and how many under cover agents are there in each spy network?

Le Carre's novel is great and the 1970's era television production starring Alec Guinness is close to as good as television gets. But the makers of this film don't understand their material at all. They don't understand it because they don't actually care about it. There are a couple decent camera shots here but that's it.

If you haven't read the book (and/or seen the Alec Guinness version) you'll probably have no idea what's going on in this one.

4623550,5,B0059XTTW8,"I am a great fan of John le Carre's cold war spy novles, and I have read his ""TTSP"" twice (or was it three times?). I have also seen the BBC's multipart adaptation for TV (1979), starring Alec Guinness as the Brit spy master George Smiley, in its entirety at least 3 times. In this film version, I found actor Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley to be superb (as, apparently, did le Carre himself, judging by comments that Le Carre himself made about Oldman's portrayal). There are some (more or less) significant discrepancies in plot between this version and le Carre's novel (as well as the BBC's adaptation -- which followed the novel very closely but which lasts 3 times longer than this recent film adaptation starring Gary Oldman). Some differences between this new adaptation and le Carre's novel: in the novel, Czechoslovakia doesn't play into it. Instead, the Brit spy Prudeaux goes to meet the defector in Budapest, Hungary. In the novel, the Soviets (ie, Karla) are more subtle in covering their bases when they realize that one of their trade delegates intends to reveal the identity of their mole (in this newest film version, the Soviets brutally murder signalsman Tufty Thessinger and disembowel the husband of a traitorous woman trade delegate in a bathtub -- in the novel, neither killing ever happen - the novel [and the BBC's TV version, which followed the book very, very closely], the long arm of Soviet espionage is more subtle and, for that reason, more frighteningly insidious -- this insidious quality of Karla's methods is even more  well displayed in the BBC's multipart TV version of the second novel in le Carre's Smiley-Karla saga, entitled ""Smiley's People""). All that being said, I really, really liked this new version of TTSP. There are very nice touches in this film (eg, after the aging Control's death from natural causes in hospital, Smiley [who by this time had been forced into retirement from the British intelligence services] goes with his loyal intelligence-operator/helpmate Peter Guillam to inspect Control's flat. Some files are found sitting in a cardboard box on a table. There's an old label on on the side of the box. The label reveals that originally, what came in that box was a phonographic turntable. A quick Internet search reveals that the make and model of that turntable roughly corresponds to the time at which the events in this film are taking place. And in the very first scene in the film, which involves Control, he is listening to a phonographic record. The film is full of nice little touches like that. There are some things in the way this film handles le Carre's narrative that I don't particularly like (eg, in this new film version, le Carre's character Toby Esterhase, who is by birth a Hungarian and who is ethnically a Magyar, is somewhat ambiguously recast as ""Toby Esterhouse"" [albeit, for some reason, Internet sources such as IMdB and others continue to spell this character's name as the name is spelled in le Carre's novel -- nevertheless, in this new film version, the pronunciation you hear spoken by the characters is very much Anglicized, unlike in the BBC's versions of TTSP and Smiley's People); for me, Esterhase has always been one of the more interesting characters in the Smiley-Karla narrative (I hear echoes of Esterhase's voice in certain words spoken by characters in the current Showtime Network TV drama, ""Homeland"" -- a drama that I've noticed has borrowed a few things from le Carre's Smiley-Karla narrative), but in this new film version, he is characterized in a very different way with virtually no backstory (of course, to get all of these elements into the movie would make the movie 6 hours long). Another thing is the way this new film portrayed Smiley's wife, Ann -- a relationship which is really very important to le Carre's narrative. In this film, Ann is almost invisible except as a kind of ""tart-icon"" (I'm thinking in particular of how she is portrayed during the MI5 Christmas party). But again, if you want to make a 2-hour film version of TTKS, you're going to have to leave a lot of le Carre's narrative sitting on the cutting room floor. (On the other hand, I found the way this new film portrayed the character of Connie Sachs interesting. Before Connie was forced into retirement prematurely, she was an intelligence analyst who was affectionately referred to by colleagues as ""Mother Russia"" because of her encyclopedic knowledge of Soviet political-espionage arcana. In le Carre's novel, Connie is a really interesting character. Her portrayal in the BBC (6-hour) version is arguably the ""reference standard,"" but this new film's portrayal is really interesting, and it would be hard to say what it is about the characterization in the 6-hour version that is absent in this new adaptation.)

Despite all these ""problems"" (mostly involving what the director of such a film version is going to include and what he or she is going to omit),  I really, really like this new version -- I really like Gary Goldman as Smiley. I really do. I think he's great as Smiley. I'd like to see more of him as Smiley. There's a quietness to his Smiley that kind lends a sense of the inevitable in what goes on. (That quietness is never more eloquent than when, after Smile's orchestrated the capture of the mole and the mole has been thoroughly interrogated by the inquisitors and Smiley is speaking with him for one last time, the mole tells Smiley in the most sincere, plaintive voice that he became a Soviet agent in order to make a difference, to be ""important"" - the little glance that Smiley then gives the mole is truly eloquent --  I doubt any actor could have delivered that glance better than Oldman did -- and in my view, it was thoroughly le Carresque.

Underlying the tension in this movie is a quiet sense of pathos that gives this film a richness that I don't see in any other political/espionage and that seems to me to be very much in accord with the feel of le Carre's cold war novels (and which is also permeates his novel ""Little Drummer Girl,"" which is a really extraordinary novel about political terrorism published in 1983).

If you know le Carre's novels, I think you'll find this film adaptation interesting (and you just may love it).",1384819200,9,6266,4.813370473537605

4623615,5,B0059XTTW8,"I'll start this off by saying that this is a Spy movie that isn't made for todays mainstream audience.  If James Bond or Jason Bourne with their uncanny physical ability, daredevil stunts, technical gadgetry, and ability to make love to the most beautiful women inside of 3 minutes while riding a horse backwards making thousand yard head shots is your idea of the quintessential spy, then I'm not sure you're ready to be humbled by George Smiley.  The greatest antithesis to the stereoptypical international man of mystery is a middle aged man whose greatest weapon is his noggin.

Thomas Alfredson (Let The Right One In) has the latest pleasure of adapting a John Le Carre novel and takes on the heavily layered onion that is ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.""  The first thing you have to embrace is that this is a piece, while having quite a fantastic situation being resolved, is more akin to how real spy-work looks and takes place.  There really is an all-star cast here headed by Gary Oldman but also starring Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong and a few more familiar faces and they deliver.  I thought this piece had an awesome feel to the era, it was like a time machine, and that gave it great authenticity.  Like in true espionage what is required in order to appreciate this film is patience and a willingness to be able to follow the characters, who they are, and what they are up to.  If you appreciate a cerebral mystery/thriller and can keep the ADHD at bay you might just enjoy one of the best Spy movies ever. YES ever...  I've seen this movie a half-dozen times or so, that's really how much I enjoy the film.

The movie takes place in 70's England and we are following the British Intelligence Bureau and their Counter-Intelligence division codenamed ""The Circus.""  George Smiley (Gary Oldman) begins the movie as ""Control's"" (Codename of the head of CI) right hand man and we quickly see him and ""Control"" fired from the Circus bc of recent deficiencies they've had in the field.  This leaves Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) Percy Alleline (New head of CI) Roy Bland, and Toby Estehasse heading up ""The Circus.""  Smiley is like a fish out of water in retirement, especially considering the love of his life, his wife, keeps more things on the sidelines than Alabama Football and Control has recently passed away.  This is where your patience is required in the early stages, then an agent, Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) returns home under suspicious circumstances and contacts a parliament member who oversees intellligence and makes a wild claim.  Smiley is then contacted by the Member and after a meeting in which he is told that there is a dreaded KGB mole in the counter intelligence unit, the Member admits that Control had brought this to his attention before but that he thought he had gone mad. The game is now a foot and George Smiley begins his operation with the help of one outside retired police officer and Peter Guillim (Cumberbatch), long time friend and Tarr's boss.  After Smiley visits an analyst forced out for asking the wrong questions and Controls apartment and see's that Control had 5 candidates for the mole he meets Tarr to gauge the veracity of his story and his claims. Realizing that Karla's (KGB Chief Codename) mole is a high level member of counter intelligence, he sends Guillim into the Circus to spy for him and we are greeted with some tension provided by Cumberbatch.  By this time Smiley is in full gear and emotions are running high, not for Smiley who is always even Steven, and as Smiley knocks down domino after domino he gets the piece that he needs in tracking down the agent (Mark Strong) who returned home from the op that was blown the previous year that was justification for his letting go.  Smiley sets the bait at the end of the movie to see which rat will crawl onto the trap and hopefully resurrect his career and good name.

This movie has close to zero action in it and is a thinking man's movie, that being said it is based on an extremely famous work by author John Le Carre who was himself a spy for British Intelligence.  I thought that Alfredson and the cast did a bang up job on this whole gig and thank them for bringing this book to modern day cinema.  This movie is smart without being pretentious and it's serious without being over-dramatic. Alfedson is all business in his duties directing the characters and that is the way it should be in this movie.  In a world full of Jason Bournes and James Bonds a dash of George Smiley is a long time coming and I hope not too far off in the near future.  Considering this was part of a trilogy before it was cool to do trilogies it would be nice to see Oldman resurrect his role along with Cumberbatch.",1383091200,4,4743,4.60688836104513

4623623,5,B0059XTTW8,"I own the Karla Trilogy and read this book in the mid-70s. This Tomas Alfredson film is so rich in nuance and texture that it deserves 5 stars. The reviewers who give it less than 3 stars just don't understand the Cold War period or Circus work environment.

As background, I worked on the ChiComm voice desk at NSA during the Vietnam War. I worked at a clandestine Sigint base in East Asia doing analysis of intercepts. IMHO Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy captures the daily grind of intelligence work in the day. It has little of the James Bond penache and excitement.

This film is definitely Brit-Euro in speed and artistic tone. One reviewer points out that Gary Oldman, playing super sleuth George Smiley, doesn't have any lines during the 1st twenty minutes, he just sits there taking it all in. What's ultimately going on is his boss is looking for a Soviet Mole at the top of the Circus (HQ) in London. This may be a Cambridge grad recruited in college, producing high quality intellegince for Moscow Centre at the direction of Karla.

For a more youthful American audience, the film co-stars Benedict Cumberbatch, recently a co-star of Star Trek Into Darkness, as sidekick to Gary Oldman. Also, Tom Hardy deserves special mention as Ricky Tarr, one of the henchmen who do the dirty work for the Circus. Overall, the cast is full of great European players.

I can recommend Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a great story about espionage during the Cold War. Director Alfredson and author John LeCarre (see numerous popular novels) did a wonderful job.

4623662,4,B0059XTTW8,"This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is problematic.  The filmmakers wanted to give this movie a dark, washed-out 70's look, which they achieved.  It looked great in the theater.  Not so good on Blu-ray.  In the lower light shots, which are most of the movie, there is often an excessive amount of film grain.  At times, the picture is so gritty that it starts flashing--alternating between light and dark.  I adjusted the picture of my television, making it darker, and that helped some.  But it made an already dark movie even darker.  This might be one of those rare cases where the DVD is easier on the eyes than the Blu-ray.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, you might want to stand pat.

My rating of four stars is for the movie.  If I were only rating the Blu-ray transfer, it would only get two stars.  That's a shame, because this is an otherwise well-crafted film.",1374883200,,968,4.526011560693641

4623664,2,B0059XTTW8,"After listening to John Le Carre's opinions on this movie, I wonder if we watched the same movie. Maybe because he lived it he could see grand canyon deep into the characters, because I found them all pretty awful, and many of the actors I like. At the end of the movie I didn't care if any one of them lived or died.
The constant extremely slow panning showing the horrible sets and scenery was annoying and pointless.
They must have paid a bargain basement price for the wigs, hair pieces and hair coloring jobs. The orange hue on three main characters was very distracting and looked like the job of a very amateur hair stylist.
At least in this version, one doesn't need to read the book or a wiki synopsis to know what's going on or who all the characters are, but the characters are much richer developed in the version with Alec Guinness.
At the beginning of the movie after a botched undercover mission that Control (the leader) set up, Control in a meeting with other main characters, resigns and says Smiley's leaving with him. What?
William Hurt portrayed Control as a lunatic.
Gary Oldman says his lines in an incredibly robotic manner and tone as do all the other actors.
Both versions according to Le Carre show a realistic view of the espionage world. Neither certainly glamorizes the spy world as American movies and tv do. They also show the huge waste of taxpayers' money and no true accountability, because it's important, secret work, how can one expect accountability when it comes to safety, huh?

4623705,5,B0059XTTW8,"First of all, I need to point out that I did not attempt to read the book until after I'd seen the movie.. twice. When I finally started reading the book, I soon noticed that the movie and the book are VERY different from each other. I found it too difficult to follow the book, because both the movie and the book are quite complicated, and because of large differences between book and film. I am guessing that if I had read the book first, and loved it, I might not have been so pleased with the film.

However..

Since I saw the movie first, and was not comparing it to the book.. I liked the movie very very much.

I am old enough to remember the latter part of the Cold War, when things seemed less complicated in some ways.. there were the Western powers.. and there was the USSR. Back when I was a kid, so many of the villains on TV shows and in movies were Soviet agents. This movie was made recently, but it sure made me feel nostalgic.

It's a period drama, and it is done really well. I'm a fan of British shows that I can watch on PBS and here on Amazon. I like well-acted, well-scripted stories. I like British casts. I like British period drams and mysteries.. so it's no wonder I like this movie.

Also.. the cast is awesome.. Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy.. etc. Amazing!

This movie is a spy flick that is sort of the antithesis of the James Bond films. I have on occasion enjoyed Bond movies, but I like this film much much better. It's not all whizz-bang crazy stunts, tons of violence, sex, and repeat. No.. this one is slow-paced, very cerebral, understated, and excellent. I hope the sequels will be made someday soon. There are two other books in the Karla trilogy.. ""The Honourable Schoolboy,"" and ""Smiley's People.""

Since really smart, slow-paced films are not exactly massive box office draws, the sequels might not ever get made.. who knows.

But, we DO have this film. I have now seen it three times. I plan on buying it soon, and watching it some more. Yes, it is that good.

The casting is great and the movie is much prettier than the 70s while never deviating from pounding the era home in every scene.

During the height of the Cold War in the early '70s, a British In-tel operation is trying to uncover a mole in its ranks who's giving the Soviets some info that's, at least apparently, about as crucial as crucial can be.

Although I haven't read the book or seen the original '79 film, I found the whole story and presentation here very engaging. TTSS is one of the few films of its type dealing with some very BIG conflicts yet lacking elements that seem contrived or too much of a stretch. Given close attention, the storyline is lucid enough, has some well-done and believable surprises, and does not just mess with one's head for the sake of it. It's also a very revealing look at the whole cynical business of international spying/intelligence. Fine acting, particularly from Mark Strong, Gary Oldman, David Dencik, and Colin Firth.

TTSS is obviously a bit too slow-moving for the fast action crowd. The large cast of characters is also a bit hard to keep track of on first view. Non-British audiences may need the subtitles due to the heavy accents and use of slang in this film. All the same, TTSS should appeal not only to international intrigue aficionados, but to anyone who's ever been in a group situation of any sort that's full of bad politics, everyone suspicious of everyone else, etc.",1372636800,,1315,4.708695652173913

4623755,4,B0059XTTW8,"Why compare this 2 hour film with the 6 hour serial, or require it to be a precise rendition of a book of more than 400 pages? I thought it a fine attempt to take many plot threads and make two hours of entertainment from them, I enjoyed items that were not present in the book. I do wonder though how the following books will be filmed now that Guillam's character has been changed.

Firstly, there are no explosions, chases, babes or helicopters so be prepared to sit, watch and think rather than expect action and glitz to flow over you. Sure, there are some holes and inconsistencies; I suppose that I take a less forensic view to viewing films than do many of the reviewers here.

I don't care that we don't see the characters build to point the way to the identity of the mole because for me the identity of the mole is immaterial. This is about loyalty, betrayal and sacrifice. A few examples:
* Guillam ends his relationship immediately on considering that it might be used against him, quite a sacrifice in my opinion.
* A terrific moment of acting as Smiley makes a deal with Tarr that he knows will violate Tarr's trust because he can't fulfil the spirit of the deal.
* What a strange world where someone who makes such a sacrifice for their country ends up living in a caravan and teaching at a boarding school after being bunged only a few quid and a car.

There were some nice juxtapositions that made me think of how fragile lives might be and the fine line between normality and hardship. During a most stressful task undertaken by Guillam we see many characters singing along and playing along to George Formby singing Mr Woo; presumably chosen in the script as being light and frivolous and something that Roy Bland would be likely to sing afterwards to show Guillam how closely he was being observed. Whilst Prideau was being tortured his `minder' was just sitting by reading a newspaper to while away the time.

The atmosphere was wonderfully dusty, smoky and brown so conveying the impression that these are strange, quiet people in a strange world. Oldman's acting was great but then I almost always agree that `less is more'.

Lastly, there was the great irony of the Soviet national anthem at the Christmas party; tremendous, made me laugh.

If you judge it on its own merits and treat it as entertainment then I think it is good value. It's not as good as the TV serial but why shouldn't it be different?",1371859200,,2429,4.534246575342466

4623763,4,B0059XTTW8,"Unlike so many ""spy"" movies, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy features none of the car chases, gun battles, or naked women that have become stock-in-trade for the genre. Instead, you'll be treated to the intellectual side of things as George Smiley unravels the layers hidden within his own ""Circus"" as the British Intelligence agency is affectionately known. There's a mole, a double agent in the highest ranks and ""Control"" the head of the Circus is forced out after an operation goes horribly wrong. Although Smiley is sent packing with Control, he is soon recalled to find the mole by some worrying politicians. Smiley gets to pick his team, which consists of some reliable people, all well-played, and all willing to make the sacrifices necessary to get the job done. Smiley himself is a flawed individual, one willing to tolerate his wife's infidelity, his nation's scorn, his fellow spy-master's diatribes with hardly a ruffled feather. Smiley is brilliantly played by Gary Oldman. Oldman truly is incredible in this role, living up to my expectations developed from reading LeCarre's book of the same title. The movie stays as consistent as possible to the book, serving up the tedium of real spy work in huge stretches. No, this is not a James Bond thriller, but a rather a careful look at human frailty writ through the reality of the cold war. Enjoy this movie several times and keep it on the shelf.",1369699200,17,1404,4.9033613445378155
4623764,3,B0059XTTW8,"It is inevitable that this movie would be compared to the phenomenally well received 1980 version starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley. It does not make the grade on several points. It might be worth mentioning its successes first.

Since this was made 35 years after the book was written, and perhaps 45 years after the period it describes, yet it was filmed in contemporary London, it was a challenge to evoke the early post-Cold War period. The design, camera, and music crafts accomplish this by giving the whole look and feel a ""film noir"" atmosphere, often in shadows. That worked; however it tended to exacerbate some of the film's problems. Gary Oldman was first rate, in an incredibly low key way. I would bet that he studied Guinness' acting in the part and tried to mimic that effect. One thing which helped is that Oldman is closer to the age of Le Carre's character as written in the novel, which works better with the scene with former Circus head of research Connie Sachs. John Hurt did well in the brief role of ""Control"", playing it with a lot more feeling than Alexander Knox in the TV series. Like all other characters, Benedict Cumberbatch's role is short and poorly filmed, but it comes off more believable than Michael Jayston's performance as Smiley's colleague, Peter Guillam.

The biggest single negative mark compared to the TV series is that we are given no time to get to know these characters, especially since many are played by unfamiliar faces. The only actors I recognized aside from the three above are Colin Firth as Bill Hayden and Ciaran Hinds as Roy Bland. And for as good as both of those are, there was precious little time seeing them on screen to get a read on their personalities. In the TV series, you could instantly get a sense of their personalities in a delightful early slowly played scene. Part of the problem may be that there are precious few close-ups of characters' facial reactions. Half the time, it seems the camera is too far off to catch the good stuff. This is made worse by the darkness of most scenes.

It is understandable that many scenes would be cut or abbreviated or presented in a different way, but the ""abbreviation"" seems choppy. Both this version and the TV version were true to Le Carre's plot style with multiple flashbacks. Whenever I get a far better understanding of a film on second viewing, I sense that far too much was left on the cutting room floor. When I started watching it for the first time, I felt so disjointed, that I stopped and watched the TV series again, so I could get a better handle on the plot and characters.

My biggest feeling of loss was the fact that we get little good sense of major characters, and virtually no good sense of lesser characters. From the 41 roles in the TV series, characters with several major scenes are cut entirely, such as the delightful scene with Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby and Sian Phillips as Smiley's wife, Ann. Treatment of some minor characters seems to be an afterthought, instead of the depth given in the TV version. Hopefully, without giving anything away, I think both the climax and the denouement were let downs.

I think that if I had not seen the Alec Guinness version, I may have liked this better, but that's the name of the game when one evaluates artistic works. How do they stack up to similar works.",1368921600,2,3354,4.620805369127517

4623797,5,B0059XTTW8,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy perfectly takes you into the world of mid-cold war espionage. Its the early 70s, and the two superpowers are at a stand-still. Past the heated early days of the cold war where Russia and the US were racing to gain a territorial or weapons advantage. At this time the lines have been drawn and it has set in that both superpowers are roughly equal in terms of military power. This is the long slog. A time when a mild manored and good wwii vet can make a difference.
The plot is simple. A mole has made it to the top of the British intelligence service and it is one of four people. It is the job of our hero George Smiley to determine who. But throwing out accusations against top level civil servants is something that can not be done lightly and George will only come calling when he has the man red handed. If it was a matter just of guessing then anyone could do it. Only a man of his temperament and skill could accomplish this and that is why the under-secretary has tasked him with this mission.
I think a word of caution, everything is on the screen... but don't expect to see it. This is a world of nuance and the clues don't jump up and down and say here I am. This film isn't a who done it. The question is why, and when you know why. The actors become more clear and a soft spot In the plan becomes visible. Push the right buttons and the mole will reveal himself.
That being said if you expect to 'figure it out' this movie will simply leave you frustrated.  I don't think that you really have a chance of understanding the whys unless you have read the book. The fun of this movie is watching George do his job masterfully.",1368144000,9,1663,4.229559748427673

4623847,1,B0059XTTW8,"I recently caught the HBO broadcast of Gary Oldman's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and am so happy that I never bought this version.  Alec Guinness's George Smiley displays all the foibles and inadequacies of the Smiley in John Le Carre's brilliant novel.  Gary Oldman plays the role as a bland, cold, staring, arrogant omnipotence.  They call this acting?  A mounted bass trophy could perform as well.  No, if you don't already possess it, invest in a copy of the preeminent BBC miniseries to gaze awestruck at the gallery of shining British acting performances, Guinness's among that of so many others from Britain's venerable old acting royalty of its day.  Of course, the real problem comes in attempting to squeeze John Le Carre's meticulously unfolding Cold War thriller (5 hours by the BBC version) into a dreadfully ill-fitting 2-hour girdle.  What can be patiently developed by paced acting performances and intact sections dialogue from the novel-- in the Gary Oldman led production has to be quickly, ""mysteriously"" conveyed in soliloquies from Oldman to an impish and prudish looking Benedict Cumberbatch.  I wouldn't tell someone not to purchase the Oldman's Tinker Tailer, particularly if you think Gary Oldeman walks on water and not coincidently are of the type who doesn't wonder why they substitute grape juice for wine at communion or thinks that too doesn't matter much.  That is how the 2011 version, in my opinion, compares to the BBC version-- water to wine.  On the other hand, if you want to fully savor John Le Carre's marvellous tale, invest in the BBC and not the 2011 version to adorn your home DVD collection.  I can't imagine that you won't appreciate the penultimate BBC version.",1366070400,3,1707,4.996466431095406
4623848,2,B0059XTTW8,"I had avoided watching the Oldman version of Tinker, Tailor thinking that it couldn't possibly tell LeCarre's elegantly crafted story in two hours nor as well as it was told in the 6 plus hours of the Alec Guinness film version.  I briefly changed my mind when I caught ten minutes or so of the Oldman version while surfing the movie channels.  It seemed to be well acted with decent attention to the story.  I thought I would try it and see.

When I got the DVD my first problem was with how poorly the master film had been copied to the disc.  It was dark, dark, dark.  Not at all as I had seen it on TV.  Characters sitting in chairs next to windows with the sun streaming in looked like they were sitting in a dark room.  Outside shots were dull not bright, etc.

That problem aside, as were many of the current Amazon reviewers, I was surprised at how key elements of the story were savaged in the apparent interest of brevity.  The worst was the crucial scene at the end where the ""Mole"" is transitioning from unknown to known (about to be caught).  This was absolutely unintelligible both visually and auditorily.  I was left with a ""What just happened?"" feeling. And, this ""capture"" was the whole point of the story!

All in all, if you want to know the story this movie is trying to tell, you're better off if you read LeCarre's books first.  On the other hand if you already have read LeCarre then you'll be able to fill in the gaps in the story the film makes all too readily available.",1365897600,2,1497,4.338129496402877

Watching the older six hour television mini-series with Alec Guinness again...then this new two hour movie was the way to go. The story wasn't changed just shortened; several sideline operations were cut to show only the hunt for the mole in Circus (the British MI6)...there were four suspects. And I enjoyed the George Smiley ""the spy who came in from the cold"" interpretation by Gary Oldman who was a better age for the role; both Guinness and Alexander Knox as Control were old men in the 1979 film. The other performances including Colin Firth and John Hurt were so-so...compared to the fine cast of the tv production. (Although Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam were very watchable.) The settings were dark, dreary, and dull except for the ending scenes.

A very snappy cabaret song, ""Le Mer"", sung by Julio Iglesias after the mole was discovered ended the film with sunny portraits of the remaining Circus guys...including Smiley, the last spy, sitting on the ""throne"" as its chief. (I'm reminded of a regal bright red suit worn by Henry V at the end of a production of the Shakespeare play at the Newberry Opera House; such spectacle ends an altruistic story on a high note, don't you think?)

Although I could have watched this current film without the plot refreshment of the television series....I believe it helped to follow the story better...and to see different actors in the main roles was interesting... I have an ancient Greek viewer attitude about remakes.

4623939,5,B0059XTTW8,"I don't suppose it would be possible for a film with the cast list of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to be all bad, but this film more than meets expectations.  John le Carre's (also excellent!) spy novel is something like 400 pages long, and it was adapted into a well-known 6-8 hour miniseries in the eighties.  It's not often that a two hour adaptation of something like that works -- but this does.

The creators of the film chose to focus on one important theme of the book which they put into the mouth of Riki Tarr -- ""Everything you think is gold is s***"".  In order to do this, a lot of the charm of the book is lost -- For example, I couldn't imagine Guillam in the film doing a bad Paul Robeson imitation to test out speakers and then Smiley giving him a hard time about it -- which could potentially be disappointing.  I didn't mind at all, because it made the film more focused.

And despite the depressing atmosphere, and the depressing theme, there was a satisfying and much less cynical conclusion than one might expect.  There might be gold after all.

4624035,2,B0059XTTW8,"Anyone who truly wants to enjoy this movie must put all recollections or thoughts, if any, of the 1979 mini series with Alec Guinness out of your mind.

For those who have seen or have this mini series in their video library, it is a compelling version of the John le Carre novel. Alec Guinness has never been better than in his role as George Smiley, the plodding, methodical, yet one-dimensional spy hired to find a mole in MI 5. The mini series boasts of a well-written script, brilliant direction, and strong, unforgettable supporting roles. The mini series runs for more than six hours; there are no car-chases, no buildings falling down, no gun fights, yet it will keep you at the edge of your chair (or couch) for the entire time the series runs. It is a hard act to follow.

This movie does the best job it can to put le Carre's novel in modern-day terms. The major shortcoming of this film is that it tries to better the mini series by imitation -- and there just is no comparison.

Gary Oldman, of course, plays the title role of George Smiley, the character portrayed by Alec  Guinness. While Oldman is a fine actor, this is not his finest work. He does not make this character his own. He appears to be imitating Guinness, but what results is Oldman playing Smiley as an Alec Guinness on Valium.

Oldman is not alone in the rather blase characterizations in this film version. Some of the other most prominent were:

John Hurt. He plays the character of Control, the director of the Circus, attempting to ferret out the mole in the agency. Alexander Knox played Control in the miniseries. Knox was perfect for the role. Knox personified death warmed over, a burearocrat utterly exhausted by the intra-agency in-fighting and back biting. Hurt is good, he has the look, but acts the role as if he is utterly bored by his job, not exhausted.

Toby Jones. He plays Percy Adeline, the usurper of Control's position. Michael Aldridge played Adeline in the miniseries, and imbued that role with the pomposity, arrogance, meance that la Carre intended for this character.

Mark Strong. He plays Jim Prideaux, the spy who was nearly murdered by the mole in the agency. Ian Banner played Prideaux in the original miniseries, and deftly portrays this character as the broken, shattered spy he was. Strong is not broken or shattered but catatonic.

Oddly enough the best portrayal is a lessor character, Toby Esterhasie. David Dencik brilliantly plays this character as the sniveling dog that he is. Also, Tom Hardy is good, very good, in the Ricki Tarr character, the wrong-go outcast who first makes the existence of the mole known.

On the whole, however, the actors undoubtedly attempted to portray the tedium and daily grind of the agency. What resulted was a group of actors who appeared to be sleep-walking.

Why was Oldman nominated for the Academy Award for this role? No doubt it was the result of collective guilt by the Academy for not previously nominating this actor for his body of work; Lord knows there are other roles he should have been nominated for. He will be nominated soon and hopefully win the statue he so justly deserves.",1359072000,,3148,4.715846994535519

4624042,2,B0059XTTW8,"For a far superior experience of this story, read the book and watch the 6 hour, three-part, BBC mini-series. Both the movie and TV production have great actors, but the acting in the BBC series is superior (Alec Guinness, Ian Richardson, etc.) and, being three times longer in length,  the series has time to draw the complicated story out more successfully. Even then, the brilliantly acted and filmed mini-series is complicated and is better understood and appreciated if one watches it a couple of times after reading the book.

I don't believe someone who has no familiarity with the story can watch this 2 hour movie without being confused about the plot. For me, having read the book and seen the BBC version two or three times, the movie was rather disappointing.

 Partly because of the problem of the story being too condensed, the viewer has to be able to pick up details in the plot very quickly, and remember them well, or he/she will be completely lost. This relates, in part, to a number of flashbacks that could be very confusing.

I also thought some of the changes made in the plot for the movie (apparently to save time) were less plausible than the BBC and book versions. For example, in the movie, government official Oliver Lacon appears to launch an investigation of British Intelligence solely based on a phone call from a stranger named Ricki Tarr who tells him he works under agent Peter Guillam and that ""The Circus"" (British Intelligence, MI5) has a mole. Without even checking with Guillam (who, by the way, would have denounced Tarr as a traitor unless he could be convinced otherwise), Lacon calls George Smiley in and initiates an unofficial investigation. At least the BBC has Lacon, Guillam and Smiley talk things through with Tarr before Smiley is asked to find the mole. And threatening to fly Toby Esterhase back to Europe and drop him off (apparently to face arrest due to outstanding warrants) in order to get him to cooperate with Smiley and reveal the address of the safe house seemed a bit much to me.

Included with the DVD version of the movie is a bonus feature of scenes that were cut. These are not worth watching and I am surprised they were added to the DVD. For example, what is the point of watching George Smiley cook an egg for three minutes?

4624091,2,B0059XTTW8,"Subtlety can be a tricky thing. In the hands of a craftsman like Elia Kazan, it can be the pathway to a masterpiece. But in the new adaptation of John le Carre's espionage novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, director Tomas Alfredson banks on the trait so heavily that the rather simple narrative at the film's core is quickly lost in a convoluted mess of long pauses, meaningful glances, and generally frustrating storytelling.

It should be noted that this approach works wonders during the film's opening ten minutes or so. The early sequence of a potentially volatile meeting between two edgy gentlemen looking very intense and covert unfolds with palpable tension and remarkable attention to detail, playing out almost like a description-for-description visualization of a novel. However, this alluring scene - followed by a silently character-developing credits sequence - is as far as the thrill goes. Things unravel quickly as characters, subplots, and flashbacks are introduced and subsequently passed over in a whirlwind of information that, upon closer examination, really isn't all that complex. It's just that Alfredson wants us to believe that it is. This decidedly impenetrable structure is the film's ultimate undoing, as it creates an uninterested distance in the audience and renders the proceedings dreadfully dull and boring. In the end, Alfredson favors intricacy over forward momentum and forced style over character development. When the identity of the mole in MI6 is finally revealed, all one can muster is a disinterested shrug, as one can hardly tell the difference between any of the suspects in the first place.",1356048000,,1636,5.292307692307692
4624092,3,B0059XTTW8,"I suppose we should be thankful for what this film is - a realistic interpretation of the way the real intelligence community works, or did work in the '70's.  Thankfully, no overly extended chase scenes, gun battles, improbable martial arts, etc.  In fact, there may be only three gun shots in the whole film.  John Le Carre's novel is replicated in atmosphere, realism, and tension.  It's a subtle and dark film, and no doubt some reviewers who thought it slow and dull may not be tuned in to something that isn't ""Mission Impossible Part Whatever.""  So I thank the filmmakers here for trying to provide a cerebral spy film, for a change.

But my problem is that I have the memory of the seven-part BBC production from 1979 as my touchstone, and by comparison, this film falls short in some ways. It's unfair to say Gary Oldman is not as convincing as the late great Sir Alec Guinness in the role of George Smiley.  Oldman offers a commendable (if rather constrained) version, given the impossibly short time he gets to develop the character.  This may in fact reveal why the film is a bit unfulfilling - by trying to cram into one reasonable-length film, a sprawling, intricate, complex, and carefully developed story that took the BBC over seven hours to portray was not a task that could be done without truncating something.  This shows in the characters.  Even several of the main characters under suspicion of being the mole in MI6, Bland, Esterhase, and Haydon, have little dialog.  Only Alleline, in my view somewhat miscast with Toby Jones in the role, has significant words that extend very far.

This truncation is so extensive that Ann Smiley, the troublesome wife who drives much of Smiley's thinking, is not only without dialog, I don't actually think there's a full facial shot of her (this character was much better developed in the BBC series). Perhaps the director thinks this was an effective device to make Ann mysterious, but it just makes it puzzling how Smiley can be so tortured by her, when we barely know what the heck she looks like, much less what she may say that also creates anguish for Smiley.

I suppose for those not already knowing the plot there would also be an issue of confusion, since the non-continuous scene jumping and flashbacks could lose many.  Also, the jargon of period British intelligence could be puzzling to some as well. Again, given so little time to work on the development of what is perhaps one of the best Cold War spy stories, one gets the impression that too much content is being forced into too small of a vehicle.  OK, modern audiences may not have the patience or attention span to sit through many hours of a multi-part series these days, but compressing 7 hours of a story (which as I recall, was still pretty compelling) into 2 hours or so means something's going to be lost.  And this film loses a bit too much.

To be fair, I would recommend the film, even if I feel it could have been more complete, and/or more faithful to the full story that I think Le Carre was intending to tell.  It's still a very interesting effort and worth watching.",1356048000,,3113,4.639344262295082

The negative reviews tend to fall into one of two categories: people who have never read the book or seen the BBC miniseries and find it ""boring,"" and those who have read the book and/or seen the BBC mininseries who hate any changes and hold the miniseries as the perfect good.

 For the former, it can only be said that they perhaps would be better off viewing something that demands less of their attention and effort. (I really don't intend for that to sound like a put-down, so if it does, I apologize.)

For the latter, it can only be said that while some of the changes are nonsensical (Guillam is a homosexual?!?) or unneccessary (why combine Westerby with Collins when Collins himself would have been sufficent for the plot?) they are hardly damaging to the integrity overall. In fact in some instances, I found that some of the changes enhanced the story. For example, I really enjoyed the confrontation scene between Smiley and Esterhause on the tarmac as opposed to just some room in a safe house. Quite thrilling.

As to holding the BBC miniseries as the best representation: while I enjoyed the miniseries I felt that it's age was showing. In addition, while I respect Alec Guiness, I have long felt that all of his performances tend to be similiar. Whatever role he is playing he always exudes strength and his portrayal of Smiley is no exception. Gary Oldman's performance is much more represemtative of the character in the book. Diffident and quiet, slow and introspective, old and tired; Gary Oldman astutely portrays a character that is morally conflicted, in pain, intelligent and underestimated. Exactly as he is in the book.

The rest of the cast was an anglophile dream come true. John Hurt, Colin Firth, Stephen Toby, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, and Tom Hardy, in my opinion, were exceptional. In fact, the whole cast was so full of British talent and the movie so short (relatively) that I don't think the great Ciaran Hinds had any speaking lines!

As to the other aspects of the film, the cinematography was gorgeous, the set pieces extraordinary (60's London, Turkey), and the soundtrack evocative and in some places stunning (the use of La Mer at the end was inspired).

In short, this is one of my favorite movies.

I've read the book (the entire Karla trilogy in fact, as well as Call for the Dead, A Murder of Quality, and The Spy Who Came In From the Cold), and have seen the BBC miniseries. This theatrical version, while too short, is superior to the miniseries and I highly recommend it.

Befitting Smiley's character, Gary Oldman's performance largely conveys his emotions through subtle changes in expression, making his few moments of greater reaction the more powerful. Of course these moments are never in view of the other characters in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch also gives an memorable performance.

The movie conveys the sadness and isolation of the characters without ever using these words.

4624189,4,B0059XTTW8,"The first obvious comment to make is that this film must inevitably be compared not only to the Le Carre novel but the television miniseries which preceded it by decades. As others have pointed out, the film suffers the inevitable disadvantage of trying to tell a complex, textured story in just two hours, while Le Carre had the relative luxury of hundreds of pages and the miniseries had six hours of narrative to work with. Be that as it may, the film succeeds in its story telling far better than one might have expected. The viewer's got to work for it, and I'm sure I had a huge advantage in having already read the book and watched the miniseries; still, it's pretty much all there, but in the cramming several elements were lost or distorted. The mission on which Jim Prideaux is wounded is changed significantly, probably for the sake of streamlining the plot, but so is the manner of the final revenge. That alteration at the end does provide for some effective counterpoint and again the saving of several minutes, but it's a less plausible payback than in the book and in its own way rather less satisfying to me. Other changes are less explicable -- why, for instance, the character of Peter Guillam was made gay in the film is beyond me. As for casting, I believe that Gary Oldman is marvelous. I don't think he's any better or worse than Alec Guinness was in the miniseries as George Smiley, just different. And his kind of different works exceptionally well. Other supporting players are quite well cast, but my main problem is with Colin Firth as Bill Haydon. To my mind, Ian Richardson patented that role in the miniseries, and Firth -- though an exceptional actor -- doesn't portray Haydon as well as the detached, ascetic Richardson did. Production values in this film are absolutely first-rate -- the sets capture the dingy workaday world of The Circus and its spies, operatives and bureaucrats, and John Hurt almost steals the film from Oldman in his short appearances as Control. But it remains Oldman's vehicle, and his version of Smiley controls this two hours with the same silent grip that Guinness' character had on the miniseries. Perhaps more so, actually. I'd love to give this film five stars, but the changes and distortions that I mentioned earlier, perhaps so necessary to cram this thing into two hours, make it less than perfect, and so I give it four. But be advised: If you haven't read the book or viewed the miniseries, I'm giving it three stars for you -- I suspect that a lot will be confusing your first time through. Be prepared to watch it several times; it might grow on you. Maybe.",1353110400,,2629,4.668103448275862
4624190,5,B0059XTTW8,"As a fan of both the Le Carre novel and the 6 hour BBC version (starring Alec Guiness), I was a bit skeptical about this film. It didn't seem possible to reduce such a complex story into a 2 hour movie. But, I gave it a chance. I am very glad I did. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is an exciting, tense, cerebral thriller. The director brilliantly captures the feel of the 1970s, the uncertainty of post-war Britain, the fear of a still-powerful Soviet Union, the claustrophobic and ego-driven good old boys secret service, and the desperate desire on the part of British intelligence to be a player on the international scene. The actors are, across the board, perfectly cast. Gary Oldman has rightly received critical acclaim for his spot-on portrayal of George Smiley, Le Carre's unlikely hero. But equally deserving of praise are Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, Mark Strong, Kathy Burke and David Dencik. The film does take some shortcuts, and changes a number of plot points, which make the film more of a variation on the novel than an adaptation. But the main story-line remains intact. There is a mole in the British Secret Service. George Smiley, who had recently been forcibly retired, is called on to discover the name of the mole, and stop the hemorrhaging of secrets to the Soviets via Karla, Smiley's counterpart and nemesis. One may well ask: do you have to have read the novel to enjoy and understand this 2 hour abbreviated version? Well, when I saw it in the theater my wife came along. She'd never read the novel. But she followed and enjoyed the film. Anecdotal evidence, I know, but evidence. I have a preference for the 6 hour BBC production, primarily because 6 hours provides more room to develop the finer points of plot and character. As a repeat reader of the novel (and its sequels: The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People), I appreciate the depth and breadth provided by the longer version.

4624222,3,B0059XTTW8,"Gary Oldman and Tinker, Tailor have an impossible task: to measure up to the 1979 BBC mini-series of the same name.  The movie makes a good try, but ultimately falls short. There is just too much to the Le Carre story, and it cannot be told in two hours.

There are some interesting aspects to the movie. For instance, the tawdry, bedraggled look to the sets is reminiscent of ""1984"" or ""The Hour,"" and provides an interesting subtext to the gray, unexciting, and often desperately pointless lives of the main characters.  Also, the movie does clarify a few aspects of the plot that were left undeveloped in the mini-series (the fate of Irina chief among them).  But in the main, the viewer is left with the feeling that he came expecting a banquet, only to find that he missed the main course.  Gary Oldman does a good job portraying Smiley, but it is just not possible to top the 1979 performance of Alec Guiness.  I must also say that the supporting cast of the 1979 mini-series is so good (particularly Ian Richardson) that it is hard to overlook how lacking the movie's supporting cast is by comparison. Worse still, a number of characters are combined in the movie while others, like Karla, are dealt with off-stage -- there just isn't enough time to tell the tale.

Take my advice: buy a multi-system TV, buy the original BBC mini-series on Amazon. UK (only availble in PAL, Region 2, and only on videotape), and you'll never regret your decision.  I've watched the mini-series at least a dozen times, and every time I discover something new. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, but only once. The mini-series is for the ages.

The cinematography and score were fantastic, just beautiful and really captures the quiet Cold War dread hanging over England. The acting is similarly great, a who's who of British talent led by Gary Oldman.

But what a disappointment.  I'm not able to objectively review the movie on its own merits.  I can't see it without thinking of the books, and the mini-series.  This does not hold up.  There are some great small scenes, but the overall move just doesn't pull you in.  Worse, though, are some things they changed, for no obvious reason.  I don't consider these spoilers; they really are small parts of the movie;  But, they are small parts, so why change them?

First and most obvious, they moved the whole Czechoslovakian incident to Hungary.  Why?  Was it cheaper?  If so, just film there, but pretend it's Czecho.  This struck a sour note from the beginning.

Second and much more subtle, they replaced Sam Collins with Jerry Westerby.  Why?  What possible reason could they have had to swap Jerry in for Sam?  I honestly don't remember what Jerry's role was in this book, but he's the titular Honourable Schoolboy in the next book.  Did they just give him a bigger role in this movie, setting the audience up for the next possible movie?

These are minor, but they ruined my enjoyment of the movie, and there wasn't anything else to make up for these and other shortcomings.

Gary Oldman plays an agent for British Intelligence who's called out of retirement to uncover a possible mole in the top echelons of the agency.  Set in 1973, the complex - a bit too complex at times, perhaps - plot utilizes flashbacks to unravel much of its story.

Written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and directed by Tomas Alfredson, the movie doesn't go for the cheap thrill or the easy stunt, relying on intellect rather than action-movie antics and pyrotechnic special effects to generate its suspense.  The tone is subdued and carefully modulated, the pacing slow and deliberate.

4624304,4,B0059XTTW8,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a thinking person's spy movie. It isn't the flashy, fast-paced spy movie with an obvious plot like the typical James Bond story. It also doesn't have the overly-done special effects of the typical American-style action movie. Instead, what it lacks in speed and eye-candy it makes up for with classic who-did-it storytelling. It is the story of a British spy, forcibly retired under suspicious circumstances, being brought back in secret by the highest authorities to reel in a suspected mole in British Intelligence. You watch, you guess, you think.

  Gary Oldman's George Smiley is a classic old-school detective in this tale. Based on the book of the same name by spy novel author John le Carr&egrave;, this spy story is more like a mix of Clue with Sherlock Holmes than the more common western-style spy story. Smiley follows the clues through thoroughly, trying to figure out which of his former colleagues is the guilty party. The only clue I will give is the guilty party was the most unexpected person at least to this reviewer; maybe you are better at guessing these things than I am. Smiley even has a spy within the agency working for him in secret, getting information to him at great personal risk. The story is great but it does develop slower than most people in this day and age probably would like.

  The HD transfer and the cinematography itself are very good. In particular pay attention to the chessboard scenes- you will know them when you see them. The sound is very good too- at least given the type of movie this is.

  In short, I would suggest any avid spy movie fan purchase this movie. If you are only a light fan of the espionage genre, you might wait until it comes down in price or perhaps rent it instead of buying it. If you are a hardcore spy fan, then you might consider reading the book and the several others that follow it in the series. I know it is now on my to-read list. I give this movie 4 stars- only taking one off because I know this movie may lose some appeal to people who like everything fast and obvious.

This is a story of subterfuge and espionage in cold war Britain, focusing on the highest ranks within British Intelligence. Now, I am a huge fan of intelligent and engaging spy films, but be warned; this is not James Bond. Gary Oldman referred to his character George Smiley as ""a thinking man's 007"". Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy does not rely on relentless action and explosions, but rather it is carried by a tremendous story and cast. It challenges the audience to actually pay attention in order to remain engaged in the story and for those able accomplish this, they are well rewarded. In terms of cast (which you can look up on IMDB), you couldn't possibly ask for a better group of British actors; it is not difficult to imagine these actors as accurate portraits of cold war British spys.

Visuals: For those of you who have seen ""Let The Right One In"" or are familiar with Swedish cinema, it tends to be extremely polarizing because it's slow, often with long periods without dialogue, and a lack of in-your-face action. However, the author of the novel on which this movie is based, John le Carre, consulted on the film and was supportive of Alfredson. While the film can seem slow at times, there are often subtle visual elements that dramatically impact the story. The set design and cinematography are spectacular, aspects that require a keen eye. The film has a soft visual feel, which makes the film feel more period-appropriate.

Audio: In terms of the score, the audio is excellent and well balanced. I have watched this film both on standard TV speakers as well as a high-end Bose system. While there is some obvious ADR, the dialogue is clear and the sound does not max out causing distortion. However, I cannot stress enough the importance of paying close attention to the dialogue. In a complicated espionage film, missing a single line could potentially take you out of the film.

Special Features: This section will usually make/break my decision to purchase a film. I loved this movie, and would have most likely bought it either way. The special features on this film are rather standard: deleted scenes, cast interviews, and a featurette on the making of the film. But, what makes this movie worth purchasing is the feature commentary with Gary Oldman and Tomas Alfredson. They bring to light some of the more subtle elements of the film that may have been missed by even the most astute viewer. Often, when determining whether or not to purchase a film, I consider whether it is worth multiple viewings. While I won't be clamoring to watch Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy repeatedly, I can confidently say that I will watch it many times in the future.

If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do; you may be pleasantly surprised. This is a story and character driven film, so it is not for everyone. If you have seen it and enjoyed it, I highly recommend purchasing this Blu-ray.

The plot (this won't give away anything important) is about the efforts to track down a `mole' in the upper echelons of the British Secret Service. The whole film jumps back and forth between the present and the past, and I was never sure exactly which I was watching. One of the protagonists gets shot in the end (as a traitor?) but another is dispatched to Moscow and yet another to Siberia. Were they all traitors? Was it in fact a conspiracy? I just thought the whole thing was a disorganised mess.

The script is unclear in many places, no doubt trimmed to fit within a reasonable feature length but the material needs more time. This trimming reduces many fine actors to almost walk-on parts and denies them the opportunity to define their characters. Esterhazy and Bland are two examples. They are almost cyphers here. And Bill Haydon(Colin Firth) is given no chance to give his motivation for his actions. There is some serious miscasting too. Ciarin Hinds should be Percy Alliline not the shorty featured. Political correctness also raises its ugly head here. Peter Guilam is a homosexual here while in the book and 1979 version he is a ladies man. This was completely unnecessary, which is strange since so many explanatory material was excised elsewhere. This movie is is one more proof that remakes are a bad idea.

4624332,5,B0059XTTW8,"I hadn't watched this movie in a while, just watched it again, and saw the huge number of one star reviews. I read probably 15 or so. They break into two sets, roughly. One that liberties have been taken with character/action compared to the book, the other that it simply didn't make sense.

I'll take the second one first. This a story, maybe THE story, written about trying to discover a double agent who has worked his/her way very deeply into an enemy spy agency. I.e. it's probably the hardest thing for _actual_ spies to deal with, since everyone could be suspect and not only _could_ the mole be someone you know, if you're important enough as a spook you _should_ know the mole. Probably quite well. So the plot is going to be a little harder to grasp than Mission Impossible or an adaptation of an Ian Flemming book. However, this book is closer to what the life of an actual spy might be, because the guy who wrote the book _was_ and actual spy.

The first argument, that too many liberties ate taken with the book, is preposterous. That a character here or there is combined, or that some license is made adapting a 200 page book by a master suspense writer, is not just unsurprising but is necessary. A fair number of this crew also seem to have a terrifically rough time with the fact that Peter Guillam has been changed into either a bisexual or gay character. They mention his 'robust' heterosexuality in the book a lot. If you think about it a bit, there was a very good reason for making that change for the film version. If you don't think of it, keep trying. All of the other changes should be filed under 'necessary' or 'of little import' and occasionally 'an improvement.'

For example, the Jim Prideaux character gets I think a better treatment in this version than in the book. The relationship between Smiley and his wife is not nearly as explored, but my guess is le Carre and Alfredson decided that could be a movie of its own. Toby Jones as Percy might overdo it a bit, but then again maybe not. There are plenty of sniveling pricks in any bureaucracy. Gary Oldman had some limits on what he could do with Smiley because he didn't have the body type (dumpy, overweight, poorly dressed, unassuming), Oldman is a fundamentally magnetic actor, and he didn't do as much direct interrogation which is where Smiley is largely fleshed out, pun intended, in the book.

However, if you can (all the way here in 2012) accept Peter Guillam is now gay and that Smiley isn't the exact Smiley le Carre put into the book, there is a whole lot the movie gets right. The cloak and dagger stuff within the agency, between ladder climbing types. The constant problems with money the English government had at the time when the pound had been devalued and the country was still not completely recovered from WW II. I've spent a good bit of time in Budapest and Istanbul and the scenes in Istanbul feel like Istanbul and the scenes in Budapest are eerily correct, even though the latter were shot in Prague. I don't know HOW they did that but they did. The performances of everyone, from Oldman down to Svetlana Khodchenkova as Irina and Tom Hardy's lovesick Ricky Tarr, was fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch was a brilliant Peter Gilliam, handsomer and more upper class than Smiley, but who comes to trust his partner more and more as the film goes on. Lastly, the locations, costumes and cinematography are spot on for the era. It looks like slightly faded Kodachrome 64 to me, already turning a little green.

Just watch this film, folks, and if you need to watch it a second time to get a plot twist right here and there that you might have missed during round one.",1344556800,98,3674,4.552193645990923

4624368,2,B0059XTTW8,"I generally consider myself a patient and open-minded film viewer. Rarely do I absolutely hate a film, and when I do it is typically a Michael Bay train wreck or a made-for-TV SyFy channel mess. If a film has some sort of true effort behind it, I can generally find something to like about it.

Until this film.

It was two hours of random (and poorly indicated) flashbacks, characters with no background and no reason for me to care about them, and a horrible score behind it all.

The end, which I think was supposed to pack an emotional punch, acted more as a relief, an ""OK, it's finally over"" signal that I could now remove this turd from my DVD player and not feel like I didn't give it a chance due to missing something.

If there is ANY redeeming quality, it was that the actors were very good. Sadly, the story and direction were abysmal and their talents wasted.

I imagine that those who read the book might like this film a bit more, given that I'm sure the characters are far more fleshed out, and the story more detailed and cohesive. Sadly, this film feels more like a very long ""CliffNotes"" of a story, that seems to jump from one key event to another with all of the rhyme and reason and character development eliminated.

It's not a film that rewards patience. I am plenty patient. The issue is that there's just nothing there to be patient for. It's a drama with NO DRAMA.",1343606400,,1391,4.392996108949417
4624369,3,B0059XTTW8,"While the distillation of the extremely complex plot of the novel is done very efficiently here, I still question whether someone unfamiliar with either the book or the television series would be able to follow it. In essence, I question whether a two hour format is the appropriate medium for this material at all, particularly since there is so much plot (even in its reduced form) that it trades off with characterization. Of the possible moles, for instance, only Alleline has a clearly defined persona-- not because the acting is poor or unmemorable (indeed, the whole cast is a bit of an English character actor dream team), but because so much has been cut (Bland's part has been nearly excised altogether). Even when scenes remain, a good 85% of the dialog from the book is gone (a shame, this, since Le Carr's dialog is so good). This means the audience never invests in any suspects, nor has the time or data to ponder who the mole could be. It is difficult for me to imagine an audience caring one way or the other who the mole is at the reveal when he has been on screen for maybe five minutes prior to that point.
.
John Hurt makes a strong impression as Control (it is John Hurt, after all), and Gary Oldman is fine as Smiley (though I'll always imagine Alec Guinness in the role), but because the movie is never allowed to breathe, I find myself strongly preferring the television cast at nearly every point (probably because they get to do things in the television version like actually deliver dialog or remain on-screen for more than ten seconds at a time). The movie could really have used another thirty minutes or so to allow the performances to register. It could also have used an injection of the humor from the source material.
.
In the end, the book and the television adaptation are both much better, and my recommendation would be to investigate both (in that order). This version is not a disaster by any means, but neither is it terribly good (at least in comparison). A word or caution, however: though *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy* is a spy novel, it is not a thriller. Instead it is a serious, character-driven book whose characters just happen to be spies. There are no James Bonds or Jason Bournes in sight, and if that is what one is seeking, you would do well to look elsewhere.",1343606400,,2316,4.583132530120482
4624370,5,B0059XTTW8,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B0059XTTW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>&nbsp;When I first heard about this project (in an Entertainment Weekly feature on Colin Firth after he won the Oscar for ""The King's Speech"") my first reaction was mixed: I've always loved the story, but wondered why they would go back and re-do a novel that was made into a 6 hour TV miniseries still considered the gold standard for TV movies. And le Carre's works have a mixed record when it comes to film adaptations, for every ""Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" there's a ""Little Drummer Girl.""

Then I reflected that George Smiley is just as much a pop culture icon, in his way, as James Bond or Jason Bourne or  Sherlock Holmes, and if their stories can be constantly revived, rebooted, and relaunched for each generation (or even within generations) then I guess Smiley can have his turn too.  And this film obviously has the approval of Smiley creator John le Carre, who is one of the producers and appears in a holiday party sequence (I've always heard that le Carre felt he lost control of the Smiley character after the B.B.C. miniseries, readers came to associate Smiley with Alec Guinness, who was not whom le Carre pictured Smiley -- too old, too tall, too thin).

The story of ""Tinker, Tailor""  remains basic in whatever format it appears. The aging head of British intelligence, known only as ""Control,""  suspects his agency has been penetrated by a double agent working for the Soviets, a ""mole"" in espionage parlance. Control sends an agent behind the Iron Curtain to learn the identity of the mole, but it turns out the agent has been sent into a trap set up by ""Karla,"" the Russian K.G.B. agent in charge of infiltrating imperialist Western intelligence services. Control is forced to resign in disgrace. About a year later, an A.W.O.L. British spy surfaces with evidence confirming Control's suspicions. Because George Smiley has been in retirement, his innocence of being the mole is self-evident, and he is tasked with uncovering the double agent, which he does by setting a trap of his own.

Director Tomas Alfredson and the cast, which seems to include every contemporary British actor of note with the exception of Michael Fassbender (who was originally scheduled to appear in the movie before having to bow out) does a remarkable job of bringing this quintessential Cold War story to the contemporary screen. The movie follows the general outline of the novel, with many scenes,  out of necessity,  compressed or sped-up. As with the novel, the movie skips back and forth in time, I've both read the book and seen the B.B.C. mini-series twice, and even I had trouble following  what was going on at times. One visual clue to follow is Smiley's eyeglasses (one style before he retired, one style afterward). Interestingly, however, one key flashback scene, when Smiley has his one face-to-face encounter with his  arch-nemesis Karla in New Delhi, is not dramatized, but simply recalled by Smiley as the camera stays tight on his face. The scene is mesmerizing, and I doubt few other actors could have pulled it off. Oldman really anchors the film. Compared to Alec Guinness his Smiley is a bit less passive, less of a fussy academic ostensibly bumbling his way through the world of espionage and more of a ruthless operator prepared to do whatever it takes to get the job done. (To be fair to Guinness, he does display more of this side of Smiley's character in the sequel ""Smiley's People."")

Of course, when a story of this scope is reduced to a movie with a little over 2-hours running time, some elements are lost which gave the original story much of its nuance and resonance. To me, one of the biggest losses is that of Ann Smiley, George's vivacious wife. Her role is small, but critical to understanding Smiley's character, and underlining the theme of betrayal, personal and public,  which runs throughout the story. In the film, she's a barely-glimpsed presence, her role in the larger narrative only hinted out. Also lost in the shuffle  are the characters of Smiley's fellow spy chiefs who are the suspected moles. Talented actors like Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and Colin Firth do what they can, essentially working  with brushstrokes, but the Jane Austin comedy of manners style which distinguishes le Carre's work is largely lost. Still, there is some addition by subtraction here. I, for one, was glad to be spared the traitor's banal self-justification for his acts of betrayal.

Among the other notable story changes of note are the sexual orientation of Peter Guilliam, who serves as the Watson of the story, and the location of the Ricky Tarr sequences, moved from Hong Kong to Istanbul (perhaps because they couldn't film in the former colony now that it is back in the possession of the Chinese, and perhaps Istanbul was chosen as a substitute as an Easter egg of sorts, a reference to to Kim Philby, the double agent who served as the model for the mole, who was stationed there while still working for British intelligence). Overall, the whodunnit nature of the story is downplayed, the narrative is more of a ""how are they gonna catch him?"" story. And yes, the film does work as a thriller. The stakes are high, people are chased, guns go off (even if the bloodshed is usually more tragic in nature than heroic), and, in one ingenious  sequence, a plane landing  on a tarmac has you sitting on the edge of your seat.

Some have questioned if ""Tinker Tailor,"" even in its abbreviated form, has become a dinosaur, its pace too leisurely, its plot too complex, for today's hyped-up audiences who need everything spoon-fed to them  and have seizures if something doesn't explode on screen every five minutes or so. le Carre started writing his espionage fiction in the early 1960s as a corrective to the James Bond model permeating pop culture at the time, which depicted spying as fun, glamorous work, performed by heroic supermen  who embodied the natural superiority of Western capitalism.  To paraphrase what a literary critic once said about the mystery writer Ross MacDonald, other espionage writers write about secrets, le Carre writes about sin. Yes, he can get preachy at times (especially in his later, post-Cold War work), but at his best, such as ""Tinker Tailor,"" he provides absorbing thrillers that also serve as cautionary tales about the moral rot that can set in when a society, seeing itself locked in a great ideological struggle with an implacable foe, sublets its security, and its conscience, to mortal men operating in a shadowy, covert world virtually devoid of any outside control or accountability. Even in societies that like to think of themselves as the ""good guys."" Especially in those societies (are you listening, Uncle Sam?). In le Carre's world, there are no ""good guys,"" only professionals out to inflict damage. It's all a matter of whom they inflict the damage on, how they do it, and why, that distinguishes them on the moral calculus.

""Tinker Tailor Solider Spy"" is one of those movies that are the proverbial acquired taste. Those going in expecting a Jason Bourne or Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" style thriller will probably be reaching for the ""eject"" button after 10, 15 minutes or so. However, if you're a John le Carre fan, this is definitely for you. I also recommend this movie for anyone unfamiliar with le Carre but are fans of other entertainments for thinking people, genre works that are character driven, such as the ""Wallender"" novels and TV films, ""Homeland,"" or ""Sherlock.""

Having a lot of action and being fast-paced is usually a killer when it comes to art and sure enough, I was proved right. This story, based on a book and a rehash of a previous movie was done the artsy-fartsy way. Though I don't mind that, I'm a bit wary of constant mumbled dialogue, lots of captions translated from other languages and plenty of shots of the camera lingering on mundane items.

If the story strayed much from the original or updated it, I wouldn't know because I never saw the original or read the book. My bias is not based on either. It's solely based on a fresh look at a slow-to-develop story that had plenty to like but plenty to ruin what I enjoyed.

I must say I liked the ending. That was a big plus. Who was guilty, though no surprise, was still intriguing. However, the way the movie was edited left several threads hanging such as the boy with the glasses, the girlfriend of the rogue agent in Istanbul (a sequencing problem also) and Oldham's ex wife thread that was as confusing as it was vague, especially when played against Colin Firth's character (I think?).

Though it ended well, I'm still left with a lot of questions and unresolved issues. Maybe that was the intent, for arts' sake, but I didn't like it.

The first scene of the first episode when the agents, one by one, enter the meeting room and Percy Alleline says ""gentlemen, let's start"" is unforgettable.

This one has a quite different take. It is a only a two hours movie and they knew there was no way they could develop the characters as in the book and the BBC series. At the same time, we have a more developed George Smiley. This new version has very little to do with spies, moles or who betrayed who. This movie is not centered on that. We have instead several George Smiley close-ups, talking to us as if the only thing between his soul and us was his big glasses. He became a very deep character.

If someone watches this movie without ever reading the book and watching the BBC series, will only get the tip of the iceberg. This is not a James Bond or a mystery movie.

I wanted to decide for myself so I gave the film a try and surprisingly I was riveted from start to finish. Admittedly, I have never read the book nor seen the BBC version, so I cannot say how the film compares to those, but as someone seeing it for the first time, I absolutely loved it. The plot was actually easy enough to keep up with, once the code names are overcome. My advise is just stay with the story and let the plot unfold.
I'm sure most would agree the acting in this film is amazing. It is very subtle, nuanced and toned down. I love the general look of the film too. It looks very smoky and full of browns and greys. I had to take a star away because I thought that a scene near the end was a little bit rushed, but it did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.
If you are looking for an action packed, car chasing spy thriller, stay away, but if you love subtleties give this a chance. I'm really glad I did.",1341619200,,1089,4.093457943925234

This picture has an impressive cast and is well acted but the plotting and editing are below average. I don't have a lot of patience sifting through such things. It's the job of the people making the film to engage me, not my job to try and figure out what is going on because of poor story structure.

Regarding that impressive cast: Gary Oldman (Smiley), John Hurt, Mark Strong and Ciaran Hands.

The story revolves around a high level mole in British Intelligence and is arguably influenced upon the historical Kim Philby a la ""Cambridge Five"".

Based on a beloved novel of a similar title by John Le Carre and a remake of the 6 hour BBC miniseries. I have read nor seen these but a few of my Goodreads friends tell me the book is stellar.

4624401,3,B0059XTTW8,"I'm a big fan of both the books of John le Carre and most of the film adaptations.  Understandably, films must  compress certain elements of plot, perhaps character, in order to fit a certain time constraint.  The two British mini-series of Tinker Tailor and Smiley's People had the luxury of really getting it more right and of having Sir Alec Guinness in the lead.  Certainly, this latest Tinker Tailor would have been helped with an extra 20 minutes or  more, but much more problematic are a couple of changes from the novel that seem utterly peculiar and  unnecessary.  Peter Guillam, a more significant character in the novel, is undeniably a ladies' man, not a gay man weeping at the thought of losing his lover.  Ricki Tarr cares for the Russian spy Irina, yes, but is more vulnerable as a hunted man because of his deep love for his young daughter Danny and her mother (who ""seems to lead the pack [of wives]"" during the story); neither are mentioned or appear in the current  film.  Both changes appear to be made to reap a kind of romantic notion of loss not present in either the novel or the British adaptation for these two characters.  The same seems to be true in the 2011 cinematic treatment of Jim Prideaux, perhaps the most betrayed.  In the novel/mini-series, he is seen to return to his teaching position, healing and apparently finding peace, but the current film leaves him lonely and bitter, turning violently against the young Bill Roach, originally the character most responsible for ""saving"" Jim.

Most egregious, however, are in the changes to George Smiley, who visibly blanches and physically staggers at both the observed betrayal by his adulterous wife Anne and her dreary, pathetic return at the current film's end.  Where's Sian Phillips when we need her?!  That, along with Smiley's smug face as he takes his place of power in the final scene, undercut the world-weary, brilliant and quite modest yet powerful character that le Carre so memorably envisioned in this first of his Smiley trilogy.

Adaptations necessarily leave out, combine, or otherwise alter material from novels into film.  These alterations ought to makes sense, however, and remain true to the essence of plot and character, particularly in the case of an acknowledged masterpiece.  Alas, a conversation with scriptwriters about these changes can't happen, so I'm just enjoying the current film by taking it at face value and forgetting its genesis; I've got the book and mini-series on DVD if i want to get a really big thrill -- again.",1341360000,3,2541,4.883449883449884

Basically one guy was in charge of the whole British dept along with a small team under him.  Everyone else was below that, figuratively and literally--on lower floors of the building.  Whereas moles and missions are more fun and exciting in other movies of the type, in this one they're more realistic and the details are thought out better.  But I was also not bored at any point.
And the guy who's relegated from the spy world to teaching kids was a great touch.  An untamed man who had known comradeship and sailed the wild seas, so to speak, thrown back in with kids and able to show them how Englishmen aught to be and to bring along one of the outcast kids a little bit.

4624403,1,B0059XTTW8,"I gave up on this movie one hour in, when all I could discern was that
there was a ""mole"" in the British spy service. I don't think that's
really a spoiler since the subject of the film and novel is well known.
However, when that is the only clear plot detail to emerge in an hour's
time, you know the movie is a complete disaster.

Regardless of the who's who of British acting talent in the film, none
of them under the misguided director's influence can save the
experience from being dull, boring, confusing, and in the end,
annoying.

Who are these characters; after an hour you still don't really know.
Why are they all so depressing? You don't care because you really don't
know them.

This may be one of the SLOWEST paced movies in cinema history. The
actors mumble lines in a host of British accents; the musical score is
slow; there is a lot of space between speeches; lots of deadpan
staring; the director's art house cutting takes us all over the place
without helping us to know where we are; flashbacks come and go but
your not sure they are flashbacks. This is only part of the frustration
of suffering through the first hour of the film. You keep on waiting
and hoping for something INTERESTING to happen. You get nowhere!

No one seems to have bothered, and I am talking specifically about the
director and screenwriter, to tell the story in this movie to keep the
viewer interested; a damning and hideous flaw.

I decided to see the movie based on many of the positive reviews in the
press. Well, I admit, to all, I gave up after 1 hour. I have no desire
to return and see if things improved after that; doubtful, since the
film is so consistently lifeless. Life is really too short to waste a
minute of your time on this tedious exercise in obtuse anti-narrative.",1341273600,,1782,4.45398773006135
4624404,2,B0059XTTW8,"I read almsot all of John Le Craee's books.  ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" was one of his earlier books.  His early work was beautiful, wonderful prose, very complicated characters.  George Smiley is John Le Carre's alter ego and this character appears in many of the books.  George is smart, introverted and most respected by his ultimate enemy  - Karla - the head of the Russian KGB.  George has one weakness only and that is his wife Anne who he loves more than anyone and anything else in the world.  But they have their (marital) issues and it takes a book to read to understand why.

I understand that Gary Oldman was nominated for the Academy Awards for his leading role in this film.  He totally gets the character of George Smiley as John Le Carre wants him to be: burnt out and jaded intelligence agent who keeps a lot to himself.  He is being played by his co-workers in a game where no one is really a winner.  It is simply amazing the accuracy with which Oldman portrays a man who is lonely, deeply unhappy and disillisioned.  There is only one moment in a film when we see George smile - and it is during a flashback when he recalls company party he and his wife attended where he just looks at her adoringly.

But overall, this film is a mess.  None of the characters are developed and anyone unfamilar with the story line can possibly follow up what is going on in this movie.  There are flashbacks, action moves in Budapest and London that are difficult to follow because they are so disjointed. I am not even sure that the real feel of the cold war era is truly captured except for the brutali with which intelligence agent are killed  while in action.",1341187200,,1671,4.447368421052632

Because the characterisation is missing, the movie is an endless parade of events happening to people we know nothing about and care about less. The plot is built up slowly and it requires intelligence to watch and decypher; that doesn't make it an intelligent film - just one in which the plot has been finely chopped.

4624477,4,B0059XTTW8,"I watched this movie for the first time this afternoon.  I have not seen the BBC series.  I read the book probably 5 or 6 years ago, so I am not coming into this with completely ""fresh"" eyes.

First - this is certainly NOT an ""action"" movie in today's traditional sense.  I think if you've read any of the negative reviews, here or elsewhere, you probably know that.  I really do think if you go into this expecting a spy movie in the vein of James Bond or the Bourne movies, you are setting yourself up for instant disappointment.  While that might not be fair to you, if you didn't know what the movie was about, it's also not fair to criticize the movie so harshly just because it didn't meet your idea of what it should've been, based on a genre.

Also, people have described it as boring, slow, confusing, etc. etc. etc.  I can't agree with any of those adjectives.  The movie is deliberate - it builds, over the course of the movie.  You don't meet a character and be told - ""and he's best friends with that guy"" or ""and he doesn't like that guy.""  You are shown hints and situations that teach you to figure this out for yourself.  You have to pay attention.  You have to learn the character's names.  Since I was busy doing some other things, I put the captions on so I didn't have to have the sound up so loud - that really helped me clarify that quickly, and also helped when the speaker was off camera.  I could easily identify who was speaking and what exactly they said.  I don't intend to ""talk down"" to anybody, but honestly, it must be said that this is not a movie to casually watch.  I tried that - and found myself reversing the DVD to catch what had happened.  You need to focus on this movie and pay good attention.

I have no intention of giving spoilers or details here - you can look in about a thousand different places to find that information, if you haven't read the book or seen the BBC series.  Suffice it to say this is truly a ""spy thriller"" masterpiece - no explosions, not many guns, but intrigue, deceit, double and triple crossings galore, not to mention some really exciting scenes that really did make my pulse race!

I do want to mention the superb acting of the entire cast.  I thought each and every one was phenomenal.  Some were (basically) unknown actors to me before - Tom Hardy, for example.  I know he was recently in a rom-com but he should take on more dramatic roles, because he nailed it.  I expected nothing but greatness from Gary Oldman, and got it, along with Colin Firth and Toby Jones.

Admittedly, I am a HUGE fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, which is what led me to this movie in the fist place, but I feel that every bit of praise he's received as an actor in this role is well deserved.  His character, Peter Guillam, was one of the more developed in this version, to great effect in my opinion.  I've read quite a bit of dissension on reviews here and elsewhere about the decision to portray Guillam as gay in this version.  I don't think it damaged the story - in fact, I think it made it more clear that Guillam had a LOT to lose and took even bigger risks than other agents would have in doing the same work in helping Smiley.  Although it seems like they all risked an equal amount in risking their lives, Guillam was also risking his legacy and his name.  Had the other agents found out about his lifestyle, not only could he have lost his career and possibly even his life, but also every scrap of their respect.  I find it somewhat funny that people blame this character shift on a ""political correct Hollywood agenda"" rather than the fact that homosexuals did exist in this time and were terrified of being ""outed.""  The emotional heft that (again, in my opinion) was added to the role and the risks that Guillam took, and his anger at some of the steps he did take, was brilliantly portrayed.  I believed every single moment of Cumberbatch on screen.  I am truly astounded to see how Sherlock Holmes/Dr. Frankenstein/The Creature/Paul Marshall/all the other characters that I've seen him play but can't remember the name of at the moment really BECAME a 1970s spy - without any great change to his appearance (well, the hair) or any hammy over-acting.  Well done to a fantastic actor.",1339459200,16,4251,4.41206675224647
4624478,3,B0059XTTW8,"The four low rating reviews remark that this is a slow and boring film.  I must say that they clearly have never read the book or seen the original BBC miniseries.  John le Carre does not write spy fiction with a view to action, but only fiction that reflects the reality of the spy world.

With that being said, this movie does suffer a pretty big flaw.  While the acting and directing was good, the storytelling this movie employed left something to be desired.  I'm not complaining about any changes made.  They fit what filled a 6 hour miniseries into a movie just over 2 hours long.  What I did not like was the pacing and the failure of proper application of showing and telling plot details.

With regards to the pacing, the film keeps an even pace throughout.  It fails to actually build tension and drama by not making clear what is at stake.  The setup at the beginning of the movie and the ordering of some scenes reduces the overall building of tension.  Likewise, with such an ensemble cast, few characters are effectively established.  This results in a film which just fails to draw the viewers interest.

When to show and when to tell is very important in storytelling.  It is even more important when moving a book into a film while trying to keep the source material intact.  This movie does not do a particularly good job of that, particularly in the first half to two-thirds.  Time is spent showing one character die in bed and another in retirement when this could be exposition.  One whole scene is spent on a fly in a car and another showing a character killing an owl that flew out of the chimney.  A party which is only mentioned in passing in the novel is given three scenes.  All of this time is wasted instead of building up Ricky Tarr's story and more clearly establishing continuity.

In the end, this film is ok.  With great performances from Gary Oldman and Benedict Cumberbatch and good cinematography, the storytelling really drags down the film.  It picks up towards the end, but it is too little too late, unfortunately.

4624483,1,B0059XTTW8,"Imagine the CliffsNotes version of a great book; now imagine CliffsNotes of the CliffsNotes, only with errors, insertions, misstatements, and omissions.
 This is the highly promoted 2011 movie ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" as loosely as possible based on the novel by John LeCarre.
 ""Tinker"" is one of the greatest genre novels ever written, and it has had no competition since it was published in the 1970s.
 It was later made into a six-hour BBC TV miniseries staring Sir Alec Guinness and about half the members of the Royal Shakespeare Company. That was a television landmark, with superb acting by all, a drama that captured the dark textures of LeCarre's ""wilderness of mirrors"" very accurately.
 Not so this movie starring Gary Oldman, unfortunately now available on DVD and Blu-ray. Poor Oldman, for his sins, was last seen on the talk-show circuit, trying to salvage with DVD sales what became a theatrical and financial disaster. Here's why.
 Admittedly, a two-hour movie has to compress a lot to deal with a 350-page book, but the scriptwriters went beyond compression into revision, and lost the original narrative; they recast characters, inserted meaningless scenes, and did grave damage to the story. This script would have failed as an undergraduate screen-writing exercise.
 It is hard to review this film without spoilers, but since I advise you to shun it, here goes.
 First, Oldman's portrayal of George Smiley only succeeds when he imitates Guinness's voice and inflection. Otherwise, Oldman is a cigar-store Indian for all the depth he gives the role. While Guinness conveyed a sense of leashed intelligence, suppressed anger, and iron determination, Oldman's portrayal is as flat as a pork chop but less lifelike.
 Oldman's Smiley also gets drunk in a newly written scene with Peter Guillam, while Guinness's Smiley hardly touches the stuff. This is an obvious scriptwriter's short cut (""Loosen up and spill, George."") and undermines the character.
 In the novel, the reader was led beside Smiley to the conclusions he drew about the mole in the SIS. This was true of the BBC-TV drama, too; the viewer was allowed to draw the same conclusions as Smiley, because both LeCarre and the BBC played fair with the audience, giving us all the facts as Smiley learned them. Not here.
 In the film, when Smiley deduces who the mole is, the scene shows--honest to God!--a light going on. Why not just draw a light-bulb animation above the actor's head? This goes beyond clich to insult.
 The movie Smiley is also less LeCarre's creature of reason and more a man of threat and violence, far more so than in the BBC drama.
 For example, to get Toby Esterhase's cooperation, Oldman's Smiley threatens him with deportation to Hungary, where he is said to be a wanted man. He goes so far as to roll an airplane up to him with the implied intention of tossing him aboard and flying him back to Europe (without a parachute?).
 In the novel, not only does Esterhase operate at will throughout Eastern Europe, something difficult if your picture is on lampposts and post-office walls, but there is no threat, just a tense discussion between Smiley and Esterhase in which the latter comes to realize that he has been duped. He then spends the next few days in a safe house rather than hoping for a parachute.
 Nice visual at the airport though. (By the way, the airplane used in the film had not even been designed in the year the film takes place, but by now, the audience no longer expects believability and is probably nodding off.)
 Given the compressed format of a film, you would not expect the insertion of new scenes but here they are.
 In one Peter Guillam is shown as having a homosexual relationship that he must end to pursue the mole, breaking down in tears. In the book and BBC drama, Guillam is a tough, robust heterosexual. In another, the mole is shot by one of the protagonists, and the scent of a relationship is heavy in the air as the two stare into each others' eyes.
 The sexuality of the characters is not the issue; the fact that they took up precious time in a compressed format is. Both scenes are gratuitous. There was nothing in either sequence that moved the story line, and in the latter case, the idea of a relationship with the mole casts doubt on the motive of the shooter--was it revenge or was he working for the Russians too? Did he kill the mole to prevent him from saying more before repatriation? This is almost as far from LeCarre as you can get.
 Interestingly, when the shooter fires his sniper rifle at the mole, the latter suddenly gets a red beauty mark on his cheek and falls over. In the real world, his head would have exploded, so it's fair to say that this movie can't even get the violence right.
 Another added scene shows a Christmas party at the Circus, with much joyous badanage and Santa dressed in a Lenin mask leading the spooks in the Russian national anthem. Not only does this blow away the claustrophobic air of mutual suspicion that LeCarre cultivated in the novel, and which was captured in the BBC miniseries, it's just not in keeping with the story, and nothing remotely like it appeared in the book. Its a simple waste of time.
 This damages LeCarre's characters and concept, and does nothing to help the film which, by this time, has become a cinematic sleeping pill.
 There are other insults to LeCarre's original, but I'll spare you most of them.
 Karla appears in the first few minutes of the film, taking active part in the capture of Jim Prideaux. Not in the novel; for reasons important to the plot, Karla isn't introduced until late in the book and the Prideaux capture is very different than in the movie (though the movie version was a lot cheaper to shoot), and Karla is in Russia when it takes place. Thus, even the character of Karla is downgraded from the original.
 The character of Lacon is not LeCarre's petulant, arrogant, semi-competent bureaucrat. Ricki Tarr is a far different man who operates much differently, at the expense of the story line. Gilliam's penetration of the Circus' file system is easier than in the book or the BBC drama; indeed the SIS looks asleep as Gilliam laughably steals the crown jewels.
 Nor were the producers big on logic. In the film, a woman is shot in Prideaux's cell during his KGB interrogation. For this to have happened, you have to twist time because the woman had a relationship with Tarr after Prideaux returned to England. How dumb did the scriptwriter think we are? Or was he making a subtle case for time travel?
 This scene is new too. It never appeared in the book and works as well as a can tied to a dog's tail.
 There is another unintentionally comic scene in the Circus in which people sit reading top-hush documents at the rim of a long desk built around a huge hole though which the floors below are visible. One can only imagine the panic as one of them accidentally drops a Most-Secret document into the unclassified depths below.
 Finally, the editing seems to have been done by a film student. If you compare the credits with the characters actually shown, a significant number of people died on the cutting room floor, making this one of the few movies I've seen with a significant body count.
 In effect, the producers of this film took a hammer to a diamond. If you want an on-screen experience even remotely like the book, find the BBC-TV version; it is superior in every way. Better yet, buy the novel.
 Justifiably, the film only drew about $20 million at the box office, and I'll bet many in the audience woke up to the credit roll, then asked for their money back. In contrast, a successful summer movie earns two or three times that much the first weekend.
So, Stinker was that bad. No fear of a sequel, thank heaven.
 I hope LeCarre got paid in advance; if not, he should charge everyone involved with vandalism.

But I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because, I must admit, if I didn't already know the characters, plot, twists and jargon from watching and loving the miniseries, I think I would've been lost.
The film is full of top notch performances and also full of great movie making... y'know where an image or an action that seems nonchalant or off the cuff is actually very telling to the story and character. (like the men all swatting at a bee in the car...all but cool master spy George Smiley who merely lowers a window and the bee flies out.... a 15 second telling moment you'd miss if you weren't involved in the film, but texting or snacking instead).
So there are many many good things in this film that brings the real dreadfulness of the Cold War back to life for those who may not remember or who weren't there.

The story begins in darkness, then a door opens to let a man enter a very large room. A man will be sent to Hungary to meet a General who has the name of a double agent in Britain. There is a meeting, but it is a trap! Later there is a meeting in Britain. Then we see various locations and actions. A man walks to his home. The Treasury questions their budget items and their efficiency. We see other people at other scenes. ""There's a mole in the Circus."" Smiley is retired now but will take the job. We see a scene from the past. ""Operation Witchcraft."" Their leader is temperamental. Smiley will check the names of the recently retired. There is talk about trading access to secrets. [The talk seems pointless, as if something is missing.] Then we see an office party. There is a scene in a boy's school.

Next we are in Budapest again. A woman offers a secret as trade for her defection: a double agent. But she is put on a ship and disappears! Can he get her out? We see how telephone conversations are monitored by a government agency. Peter looks for a ledger. We see him borrow a ledger. Percy questions him. Back at George's place he attacks Ricky Tarr! George talks about a meeting in 1955. A fanatic always has a secret doubt, says George. They have an unusual Santa Claus for their Christmas party. We see more about that incident in Hungary. [The film continues to drag on.] Scenes keep repeating, like padding. There is a confrontation on an airfield. ""I am loyal!"" They get an address. Next we see Paris. There is a meting, then they leave. George waits in the dark. Are these scenes confusing? A sniper shoots a man. [What about the body?] Then it ends.

Reportedly the press at preview screenings were supplied with cheat sheets. Having seen neither the 1979 BBC mini-series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B005DXCO94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>&nbsp;nor read the 1974 John LeCarr mega-bestseller, I was lost. After a second run through with the English subtitles turned on, I still had to look on Wikipedia for the plot outline, and this remake STILL adds up to a convoluted muddle.

Remarkably, Tinker Tailor &c. was the top grossing film in the U.K. for its first three weeks in release. One can only imagine all those Brits had a leg up from the viewing the well-regarded BBC series, or that they intuitively resonate with 1970s Cold War cloak-and-dagger machinations literally hashed out over the tea table, or perhaps the English simply tend to read more spy novels. 21st Century American sensibilities, however, generally lack these advantages, which should not be an impossible feat of cinema to overcome. Period espionage films like The Third Man (1949) by British director Carol Reed continue to pack a powerful punch. This flick, however, is somewhat less thrilling than canned peas, which, appropriately, the cinematography's consistently muted tones closely resemble.

The aptly named Hardy and Strong are the sole actors exhibiting any signs of testosterone in the bloodstream. Tinker Tailor comes alive during Tom Hardy's brief scenes wherein he radiates a palpable sense of the extreme jeopardy entailed in playing for high stakes. (In short: this guy has balls.  Hardy would make a really interesting Bond, come to think of it.) Mark Strong similarly emanates an aura of danger and consequence, yet both players are hamstrung by the script's failure to ever delineate neither the stakes nor the consequences.

The remainder of the consistently saturnine, mostly male cast are not only as uniformly bland and boring as British cuisine of the period, but appear to be suffering authentic gastro-intestinal consequences, as well. Colin Firth fails to demonstrate a range stretching the full distance from A to B, while Gary Oldman never strays an inch off A. His is definitely a contender for the most everlastingly drab performance outside a Mike Leigh movie in the entire depressing history of the British cinema.",1337990400,4,2631,5.457002457002457
4624542,4,B0059XTTW8,"The new ""Tinker Taylor..."" is not a bad movie, although it strains to recapture the glory days of John LeCarre's spy genre and the grim gloaming of the Cold War. Gary Oldman is good as George Smiley if not quite as rolypoly as LeCarre's nerdy spy chief. I kind of preferred Alec Guiness in the older versions who actually DID nerdy and owlish very well. When I see Oldman I see an epicene Dracula with fake Korean nailshop glue-ons bemoaning his lost love, Winona Ryder as Lucy Westenra, but hey, that's just me.

This Tinker Taylor does capture the intricacy of the LeCarre magnum opus and the sordid infighting of the Cold War, Allen Dulles, James Jesus Angleton, et al., and the characters, notably Colin Firth, give us credible human types. But the film loses continuity somewhere in the middle, failing to explain clearly enough HOW Smiley and Circus came to find there was a mole (Firth) in their midst, and how they ferreted said mole (ok, so now I'm lapsing into subterranean animal metaphors...)from within the Circus.

A good movie, considering some of the crap being made these days (including most anything by Tarentino) but not the best homage to LeCarre's brilliance of yore.

Loved the aesthetics of the film, the 1970's greige (gray + beige) color of the film, costumes and sets.  The one bold use of color I noted was in a brilliant baby blue necktie worn by Benedict when he went to steal a log of calls from an office. Watch for it; it's mezmerizing.

The film lacked color in the way that aspects of the 70's lacked color and pace. So it accurately captured the colorless times and the standoff in the Cold War.  Gary Oldman plays an astute, plodding spy who is being cuckolded by a friend and fellow spy.  It gives him an air of impotence. Loved the chess pieces used to dramatize TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY with faces--great dramatic touch.

The movie includes the relevant plot points in the book and brings them to life, albeit changing a few details. But it's accurate enough to satisfy most Le Carre purists.

I loved the movie, having read the book.  Not sure how I'd feel if I hadn't read the book.  The book is slow-moving, cerebral, deep and slowly builds suspense.  So, does the movie.  My brother, who hadn't read the book who watched the movie with me, said it held his attention even though he didn't understand it.  Best movie he's ever seen that he couldn't follow, he said.

4624610,4,B0059XTTW8,"I still remember the 1979 BBC adaptation of John Le Carr&eacute;'s 1974 espionage novel ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" with admiration, so I wondered if a new theatrical adaptation would be worth the trouble. And I questioned the wisdom of condensing a five-hour miniseries into a two-hour film. I must say that screenwriters Bridget O'Conner and Peter Straughan have done an impressive job of condensing the material. Nothing significant is lost in terms of plot or themes, though don't get to know the characters as well, so Sir Alec Guinness' superb turn as George Smiley is unchallenged.

During the Cold War, the head of the British foreign intelligence service (John Hurt) and his deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced into retirement when an operation to uncover the identity of a Soviet double agent goes wrong. But Undersecretary Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney) thinks the mole is real and asks Smiley to find the leak. Smiley recruits Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) to help investigate British intelligence's inner circle: Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds), Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), and Bill Hayden (Colin Firth), a group of officers running the super-secret Operation Witchcraft, a goldmine of intelligence from inside the KGB.

One challenge in condensing this material is keeping it coherent. There have been complaints that this film is incomprehensible to those who haven't read the book. Well, it's been 30 years since I read the book, and I understood the film perfectly, but you do have to think to follow the connections between some scenes. To alleviate this, the characters sometimes articulate what they are thinking, which I found awkward. There have been other complaints that the chronology is difficult to discern. Usually the audience can identify a flashback by what precedes it, but there is some deliberate ambiguity about sequence that isn't worked out until near the end.

Perhaps ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a little bit of work to watch. I just didn't find any fault there. But every set is self-consciously shabby. There are teetering stacks of papers in every room, on every surface. Everyone seems to live like a mentally ill person, in a pig sty. Likewise, every wall is papered with a ghastly print. The wallpaper in the SIS conference room is an optical illusion that is reflected in the flawless, polished table. The color scheme is drab. It's a vision of the apocalypse, not of government bureaucracy in the 1970s. It's distracting and comical. Director Tomas Alfredson is to blame. And the ending is weak. Just the last couple of scenes are poor, unfortunately.

But the intent is to comment on the world today, not the world as it was 40 years ago. George Smiley seems not to think much of British intelligence or its ideals. SIS' inner circle are presented as an insular community of deluded, immoral, old men chasing their tails. They seem conscious of the futility of their schemes but resigned to pursuing them. Everybody loses. There was a certain amount of that in the book and the 1979 adaptation, but the new version lays it on thick. This is not a Cold War view of the intelligence community. It is a post-9/11 view. In this way it reminds me of the excellent 2010 French film ""Farewell"" - the Cold War re-envisioned as a vehicle for 21st century political dilemmas.",1337126400,2,3363,5.010733452593918

I think this is mostly a function of the compression forced upon the story by the movie's abbreviated length, but somehow his gray, thinning hair was not enough to convince me of his long and distinguished career in intelligence.  Oldman's take on Smiley is appropriately worn down by time and the failures he has endured professionally and personally, but to the point that his more successful past is not much in evidence.

This brings me to the related problem that the suspects, who are the most senior officials in the agency, are not really identified functionally.  What do they do?  That omission, along with nearly any other way to connect with them as individuals means that some very fine actors are basically left with nothing to do.  (Toby Jones as Percy Alleline is an exception, but he comes across as almost a cartoon figure who is hard to imagine in such a senior position.) Ciaran Hinds as Roy Bland hardly registers; even Colin Firth as Bill Haydon is largely wasted.  Since the movie is all about identifying the mole from within their ranks, the core of the mystery feels kind of empty.  Far more time is spent on the stories of Jim Prideaux and Ricki Tarr, who are secondary characters. In the end, even the motives of the mole, when he is revealed, are touched only briefly.

Director Tomas Alfredson chose to treat Smiley's wife Ann as a distant problem, never quite seen, and this was a decision that I don't really understand.  There are repeated flashbacks to an agency end-of-year party that were simply distracting.

However, that's exactly what I love about the movie - so much that I watched it a second time to try and take in all the nuance and detail of the film.  This isn't a film for someone who wants a rock'em sock'em spy action thriller.  It's a film in which you get slowly dragged into the environs, intrigue and plot through incredible acting and film making, but only with an effort by the viewer to track what's happening, understand each character and their motivations as well as the significance of each scene.  I haven't read the book, but I imagine pages dedicated to each of the key characters, and that detail has been poured into each frame and line of dialogue in the movie, making it a bit tough to dissolve unless you are paying close attention.

So, how is it possible to make this film adaptation successfully and coherent if you don't bother developing any of the characters?  Answer, you can't and this movie suffers for it.  The mole, Bill Hayden doesn't utter one word in the entire movie and therefore you have no idea as to his motivation.  You don't know anybody's motivation in the movie as George Smiley is the only crucial character to utter any lines in the movie and it's like George Smiley is sleep-walking through the entire movie.

The producers, director, and anybody else responsible for this trash should be barred from ever making another movie, and that includes Gary Oldman, for whom I had held in great esteem . . . No more.

You figure out what has happened, and who the real Soviet mastermind of the whole sordid mess is very soon, and the rest of the movie is just pro forma tedious boredom.

Unfortunately it did not, in my opinion, reflect the book, mainly due to the liberties taken (Hungary? Prideaux shot in a city not the forest? No...that is NOT what the Circus looked like, Turkey? Tufty didn't die...) well you get the idea. It is also so different than the BBC series and none of the characters in this film ""looked"" or acted or behaved like how I envisioned the characters, including Oldman as Smiley. But of course Alec Guiness is the embodiment of Smiley...Even George Mason as Smiley, in ""A Deadly Affair (1966)"" based on ""Call For the Dead (1961)"" (even though in the film he was called Charles Dobbs) was more true to the written character of Smiley. If I knew nothing about the story it would have been just a slow moving, disjointed ""trying to be an espionage film"" that made no sense. I wish I could have seen this film without any preconceived notions and expectations but of course that is not possible. I suppose that it would not have been possible for me to initially like this film, but I will watch it again and again to see if I can find the diamond in this lump of coal and it will remain in my library as an example of a different perspective and interpretation of the extraordinary novel it is based on.

The character Connie was not depicted well, we thought, especially considering the significance of her observations. Nor was the description of Ricky Tarrs' experiences well explicated.

George Smiley, former number 2 at the circus loses his job following a disastrous operation in eastern Europe.  He is secretly re-hired later to uncover the identity of the Soviet spy.

Although the film makers deserve credit for trying, it simply is not possible to do justice to le Carre's incredibly detailed and nuanced story in 2+ hours.  We know that the Soviet spy must be one of four men who run the circus.  Unfortunately, there is no time to give them any kind of back story or character development.  When the spy is discovered, we know as much about these men as we did in the beginning; that is, almost nothing.

A spy procedural with no action sequences must rely on character, mood and details of the spycraft to tell a good story.  There is plenty of mood in this film, but it comes at the expense of everything else.  Massive amounts of story detail are thrown around, seemingly at random, without any explanation for their significance.

Le Carre's novel remains one of the best spy stories ever written.  This movie sacrifices far too much detail in trying to condense the story down to movie length.

Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, came along in the 1970's. It was a classic spy novel. Intricate and based on real events. The Kim Philby scandal had caused harm to the UK and US. Philby, a second generation British spy, didn't defect until 1963, leaving a trail that went back to WW II. He died in 1988.

The six part TV series starring Alec Guiness was a great success in 1979. The Cold War was raging and the novel and series were far more sophisticated than most spy fare.

4624772,3,B0059XTTW8,"For folks who have neither read the book nor seen the miniseries, I feel this adaptation failed to spell things out that were immediately clear in the miniseries: things like the central premise (which is Operation Testify, never even named in the film), which was spelled out right away in the miniseries, along with the tinker, tailor code words and their meaning and Jim Prideaux's mission; the meaning of ""Circus""; what/who Karla is; Witchcraft and Merlin; and so on and so forth that would have made the film much more watchable for the novice. And it's not for lack of time that these things aren't spelled out: a lot of meaningless and incongruous new stuff is added in that is not in the book and therefore unnecessary.

Yes, the book is mucked about with but it's not all to ill effect: Tom Hardy gives a delicious performance and is disarmingly likeable as Ricky Tarr. Unfortunately, the time spent here on Tarr is taken away from getting to know the four suspects, and even the mole doesn't get enough airtime, unlike in the miniseries, where everyone is explored. I also missed seeing much of the Peter Gwillem character, who is quite yummy in the miniseries and has a lot of screentime therein, but Benedict Cumberbatch as Gwillem here is hardly seen, plus there's a homosexual plotline tagged onto him that is needless but not entirely out of place.

I'm of two or three minds about Gary Oldman as Smiley. Oldman's leathery expressionless face hardly moves, especially not behind those immense glasses which he does not remove even when swimming. So even though Oldman gives a presumably authentic reading of the character, he's much less expressive than Alec Guinness -- who though more cheerful and perhaps less stolid than LeCarre wrote him, is often more appealing to watch because his face actually moves and his eyes twinkle.

All in all, I'd say this movie has merit on its own, and is certainly worth watching. I think it could be a bit of a puzzle for newcomers, especially if they do not pay attention, but some folks love being puzzled like that so this can work for some people. Do check it out if you have the inclination -- for instance, it's just $3.99 to ""rent"" it for a 48-hour viewing on Amazon Instant. That's how I watched it and it was totally worth it.

The original book (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) is one of John le Carre's best written and most expertly plotted novels, which tells the tale of how Britain's spies discover and then deal with a high-placed Soviet mole. The movie is a double mess, since the lazy script will make little sense to those who haven't read the book and will offend those who have. Characters appear and disappear, mumbling their way through flat dialogue, and little of it makes no sense. Who are these people? What are they trying to achieve? Why are they speaking in code? Why should we care?

  The director takes vast and unwise liberties with the script. In the book, the British spies realise they have a problem when an agent goes to Czechoslovakia to make contact with a supposed defector and ends up being shot and injured in a wood at night. This isn't dramatic enough, so the film moves the action to the Hungarian capital Budapest (which is pronounced BudapeSHt, not Budapest, by the way, the researchers could and should have figured that one out), and the agent is shot in a botched incident which also kills the young mother of a suckling infant. This is gratuitous violence.

  As in the book, the agent takes on a false name and becomes a teacher at a boy's school, where he befriends one particularly unhappy and lonely boy who happens to be a good observer. In the book the friendship deepens, whereas in the film the teacher suddenly turns on the child and tells him to get lost. With about 20 minutes to go the movie disintegrates into incoherence and you have the impression that the director just threw scenes together without bothering to see if they made sense. He invents a Christmas party for the British spies where they drunkenly sing the Soviet anthem, and then an agent on the run makes a confused appearance, and there's a search for crucial documents, and the mole is unveiled, and this all unfolds with about as much drama and tension as the monthly meeting of a knitting club. We don't care about the characters and we don't care about the storyline.

  In short, this is a disaster. Stick to the book and the BBC series starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.",1334534400,15,2307,4.607317073170732

Regarding this film, the story was a bit confusing - too much going back and forth in time. If I could say anything to ALL actors and actresses of today it would be ""Take diction lessons!"" Everyone speaks in whispers with marbles in their mouths. This is the reason I love older movies - movies of the 30's, 40's and 50's....one can understand everything EVERYBODY says.

4624780,4,B0059XTTW8,"I didn't read the book, so perhaps that is why I thought this movie was so much better than some reviewers. Despite that observation, the cast and acting alone made this film worthwhile. You do have to pay attention, as the story unfolds from the present telling of who the ""mole"" in British intelligence might be, to scenes from the past. This past and present telling, completes the entire picture connecting the characters, and their part in the story. The movie itself takes place in the cold war of the 70's. The premise is the mission to discover the identity of the Russian spy, who has infiltrated the highest circle of the English ""spy"" community, known as  ""The Circus"". I never  thought the movie slow or boring, and anticipated learning who the Russian spy was, or if the spy would even be found out. The final minutes of the film, showing scenes from a past party, interspersed with scenes of how finding the spy among them had affected their lives, was emotional and poignant.

4624812,4,B0059XTTW8,"I haven't read the book.  I haven't seen the old BBC version.  I hadn't read any reviews.  Other than knowing something vague about the type of books by the original author and the fact that Gary Oldman was supposed to be quite good in it, I knew nothing before watching this film.

The first thing is: this is a very cerebral film.  If you're looking for a James Bond or Mission Impossible style spy movie, skip this one.  There's very little action, and very little of the ""thriller"" quality.  It seems many of the bad reviews come from people who went in with the wrong expectations.  If you're not the sort of person who likes to go to the ""art house"" cinemas and watch long introspective movies, there's really little point in watching this one.  You're probably going to be bored or confused or both.

At its heart, this film is a rather subdued mystery, which just happens to involve spies.  However, the power of the film is mostly in its portrayal of characters and their qualities -- it is a meditation on issues like honesty, power, loyalty, friendship, and the like.  These issues are played out among a group of men who are paid to be quiet and stealthy, so don't expect a lot of chit-chat or overt excitement.  Instead, there are many moments of tension and revelation (with great acting) as these things are sorted out.

The film opens with the idea that there's a rumor about the possibility of a double-agent at the very top of British intelligence.  An agent who was forced into retirement is called back by the supervising minister's office to investigate.  The likely candidates for the ""mole"" are gradually revealed and eventually explicitly identified with nicknames like ""Tinker, Tailor,"" etc., hence the name of the film.

Many have complained that there is too much crammed into the plot, that the flashbacks were confusing, that it's difficult to follow, etc.  I will grant that this is not a movie where you can get up and go make a sandwich and come back assuming you'll just figure it out.  Every gesture -- a nod, a glance, a raised eyebrow, a shoulder shrug -- often carries layers of meaning.  The acting and directing throughout is genuinely superb in that respect.  This is the kind of film where the way a character reacts to an errant bee (by swatting it or by opening a window to let it out) substitutes for 5 minutes of dialogue establishing the personality of the characters.

Even knowing nothing coming in, you quickly realize that you need to pay attention -- there are just too many faces and characters to keep track of.  And once you figure out the game, it's not too hard to follow.  The flashbacks are relatively obvious, since in almost all of them the original boss, called ""Control"" (played by John Hurt) is alive, even though he died in the opening credits.  Almost all other flashbacks are clearly framed by some character in the present indicating that he is telling a story.

In general, the screenplay is incredibly ""tight,"" with all those little details of dialogue and expressions and gestures giving you plenty of information about the characters and their situations without being overt.  Gary Oldman is at the center of this all, managing to tell us a lot about himself without saying a word for the first 15 minutes of the film.

I have only one complaint regarding character development, and it is difficult to voice this without giving too much away.  Basically, the one place where the writers clearly don't give us enough character information (or even perhaps enough for viewers to keep track of who is who) is among some of the characters under suspicion for being the mole.  This is a critical oversight, since any viewer who knows the conventions of films will realize that the solution to the mystery of the plot must lie with some characters we actually know something about.  It would be a terrible ending to suddenly turn to a random guy who had one line in the rest of the film (and whom the audience doesn't even remember) and say, ""Yes, it was he -- the butler did it!  Obviously!""

In other words, we pretty quickly come to realize that a few of the ""suspects"" are out of the running, just because we can't even remember what they look like, let alone what they might have implied about themselves in the two lines of dialogue they had.  This is a huge oversight for the writers which I assume does not happen in the book.  Instead of a mystery centered on five specific men, the viewer is forced early on to cast around for other possible culprits -- maybe the mole is someone else, maybe the primary investigator is a mole, maybe someone working with him is, maybe there is no mole at all -- and many of these speculations immediately strike the viewer as red herrings at best.

I watched the film twice because I realized how much subtlety went into the writing, directing, acting, cinematography, etc., and also to find out what I missed.  On a second viewing, my initial sense was confirmed: I still don't know ANYTHING about one of the guys who is supposed to be a prime suspect, and another one we don't know anything about until the mystery really starts to unravel.  It's kind of hard to take either of them seriously as suspects when they are pretty much ignored by the movie.

And for that reason, despite all of the film's great strengths, I think it fails as a mystery.  There's a good chance an astute viewer could guess something like the ending within the first quarter of the film.  For that reason, I think the writers failed to compress the plot of the book successfully (since I assume the book is not this obvious).  Yet I still watched it twice because the film really isn't about the mystery.  It's about the dynamics between all these characters and the subtlety of their relationships.

In the opening scene, the Control character talks about interrogating a suspected defector in search of ""treasure,"" by which he means secret information of great value.  In a way, this film also has ""treasure"": the secrets of these secretive men are gradually revealed in a subtle -- but intriguing and intelligent -- way.",1334188800,2,6111,4.654240447343896
4624813,3,B0059XTTW8,"On its own this version might do relatively well, but it seems a mere shadow of the BBC version starring Alec Guinness.  I found the tone very different.  There is desperation in the first, certainly, but it is offset by British humor, and more importantly, a warmth that comes through the stiff upper lip.  To me, the first ultimately was a film about the value of human relationships, while this felt nihilistic by comparison.

In its own right it is a tight, intelligent movie.  Nonetheless I thought they botched Connie, and somehow the characters felt unbalanced -- Collin Firth as Bill Haydon stands too far apart from other members of the Circus.  Gary Oldman is technically superb but feels a bit mechanical.

4624815,5,B0059XTTW8,"Let me preface this review with the caveat that I have not read John le Carre's novel but I have seen and rather enjoyed the classic BBC television adaptation of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.

It should go without saying that this post-millennial theatrical adaptation is a different animal. Directed by Tomas Alfredson, whose previous feature ""Let the Right One In"" was rightly heralded as an instant classic, has produced with the considerable aid of his screenwriters Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan an extremely stylish, precise, and condensed version of the story. The plot, layered not only in events and characterizations but also in themes, is complicated but not impenetrable; new information is constantly revealed to the audience as the film unfolds, which makes complaints that this film is ""boring"" all the more baffling to this reviewer. Attentive viewers should have no trouble following the film.

Cold War paranoia infests every frame. Every detail of the film feels calibrated, from the angles of shots to the drab colors of the sets to the postures of the actors, each of whom is superb in their roles: Gary Oldman portrays a quieter, more detached Smiley than Guinness, Mark Strong personifies the sadness of Jim Prideaux, and Tom Hardy makes a surprisingly vulnerable Ricky Tarr.

If I were to boil down the key difference between this film and the earlier BBC version (other than, of course, the length of time in which to tell the story), I would have to say atmosphere. Both are extremely well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted, but it was only in this film version where I could palpably feel the tension of the scenario.

This Blu-ray features a fine, film-like transfer. Extra features are not overly abundant, consisting of an audio commentary from Alfredson and Oldman, a couple of deleted scenes, and filmmaker interviews. The most interesting extra for me personally was the interview with le Carre himself where the author discusses his background and delves much deeper than the usual fluff piece.

The story of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is an espionage classic, and this latest film adaptation is a fine example of the genre and worthy of standing alongside the BBC version and other classics in the fold. Highly recommended.",1334102400,2,2309,5.114058355437666

- As a Le Carre fan, I recommend this version --it is an interesting, well crafted movie.

I read the book twenty years ago- people who whine in their reviews that this movie doesn't ""get"" the book should stick to it or the BBC TV series. This film stands on its own- sly references to ""From Russia with Love"" in the Turkey sequences- it makes it seem as if THIS was the reality that Fleming was trying to capture. Gary Oldman is perfect- frumpy yes but not too old and weird looking (as Guiness was IMO) to have that sad marriage to Anne.

I have the luxury of having NOT seen the original, as well as enjoying the measured pace and calculated actions of thoughtful spy movies. I also enjoyed the performances from all the actors. It is not an action movie, so accept that before you watch it. But it is very intelligent, extremely well acted, and probably very realistic in its pace.

On the other hand, the detractors have some legitimate grievances. Even given the genre and the intentionally measured pace, it could have used some fireworks at key junctures. This would not have insulted the genre nor cheapened it in any way. Even the ""dramatic"" scenes seemed to have been intentionally diluted, thereby reducing the dramatic ""payoff"" for the viewers. Obviously, this was deliberate in order to conform to the purpose and tone of the movie, but it can be frustrating for viewers.

This is not a ""great"" movie, but personally I was still satisfied and enjoyed it very much. I enjoy these type movies, e.g. ""The Good Shepherd"" (which took 3 viewings to fully understand!).

How do you give a fair evaluation? Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy needed the time to tell. With TV you can take your time. You can't keep people in their seats that long.

Even just the opening credits were enough to bore a statue to tears. Some folks might call it art or ""moody,"" but it's just boring and a sodding waste of time and money.

This is the kind of movie that will show a 20-second clip of the lead actor sitting in a random chair, in a random room, for some unknown reason, with no sounds or background music and then change scenes to the lead character riding in a car. It was a type of movie that was popular in the 1970's... very Woody Allenish.

Then you have the fact that all the actors have very thick Brit accents, and they all talk so softly and quickly that you can't understand a word they're saying. The entire first 30 minutes either showed scenes with no sound whatsoever, or it showed a couple Brits engaging in normal Brit conversation that only Brits can really understand. In half an hour, I understood that the movie was about the hunt for a spy in the higher ranks of British intelligence, but pretty much everything else that was said in the movie either didn't register as comprehensive, or it didn't add to the story line whatsoever.

And, then you have the scene of three men in a car, as shot from behind the rear of the car as it supposedly sped down an artificial (green screen) highway. Not only was nothing said in the car, but the entire scene was of the backs of the three men's heads in the car. If I wanted to watch a movie to see the backs of men's heads, I'd watch... well... this one, I guess.

The bottom line: If you love moody, melodramatic, slow-moving period dramas with crappy jazz for background music and listening to old British men talk about nothing exciting, you will love this movie.

4624916,3,B0059XTTW8,"Viewers' reactions to this movie must depend, in large part, on their expectations and their history with the novel and '70s era BBC miniseries.  Le Carre may be one of the great British novelists of the last 50 years who simply happened to mine the vein of espionage fiction and was at the peak of his powers, and ideally suited to deal with the Cold War milieu, in the ""Smiley Trilogy"": Tinker Tailor, Smiley's People and The Honourable Schoolboy.  If you are a fan of the novel, and watch the movie making constant comparisons, you will probably be disappointed. Le Carre's fiction is challenging, layered and deeply perceptive, and the events are intricately interwoven.  A two hour movie simply cannot convey all the novel has to offer, omits and changes certain significant details, merges characters, and did not, for me, convey the deep ambiguities and analysis of betrayal at the heart of the novel. The movie also failed to create a great deal of suspence.
Likewise, a viewer who has recently seen the 1979 BBC miniseries starring Alec Guiness as George Smiley also will be disappointed. Guiness was terrific and managed to make of Smiley a much deeper and more complex character than does Gary Oldman in the time allotted to him. The cast of the miniseries also was brilliant, from Hywel Bennett as Ricki Tarr, through Ian Richardson, Bernard Hepton, Terence Rigby, Sian Phillips, Joss Ackland, Patrick Stewart, Ian Bannen, et al.  The miniseries was probably one of the best ever BBC productions and had the time (about 5.5 hours) to develop most all of the characters of the novel, explore its subtleties, and make sense of and explain the interconnectedness of the various strands of the plot that come together and allow Smiley to find the ""mole."" Again, if you watch the movie comparing it constantly to the miniseries, I think you will be disappointed. There is a lot left out, many of the characters are barely developed, Anne, Smiley's wife, doesn't appear at all, except obliquely in a few scenes, and the sense of mystery and drama in the miniseries is much greater--you are literally on the edge of your seat in the scene in which the traitor is unmasked.
That being said, obviously, condensing the book to two hours must have been a daunting challenge, but the movie is still enjoyable and far from a failure. Gary Oldman is good as Smiley, but seems to play most of the movie in a passive state of shock.  Smiley is a damaged and conflicted man, beset by betrayal on all sides, but Oldman's protrayal is, for me, too strangely passive, and I don't think we get a feeling for what Smiley is all about.  Similarly, the other ""suspects,"" meaning the power elite at the Circus (British Intelligence), are well enough acted, but hardly developed at all. SPOILER ALERT  My main complaint has to do with one of the finer actors in the cast, Colin Firth, who plays Bill Haydon.  Haydon is supposed to be the ""golden boy"" of the Circus, the ""laughing cavalier"" whom the younger generation venerates and so talented and magnetic that, according to Prideaux (in the novel and miniseries) ""you just can't judge Bill by ordinary standards.""  Unfortunately, we really don't see enough of Haydon to understand the nature and magnitude of his betrayal.  It would be unfair, however, not to note that John Hurt is excellent as Control.
I also have to wonder whether the movie will simply make sense to viewers who come unprepared. For example, we don't quite get the idea that the failed Hungarian gambit (why it has been changed from Czechoslovakia, I don't know) was Control's last ditch attempt to unmask the traitor, and I didn't find it clear in the movie how Tarr's final assignment was designed to flush out the traitor (very clear in the book and miniseries).  There are a host of other changes of which one could complain: the merging of Jerry Westerby and Sam Collins, the sexual orientation of Peter Guillam, the absence of Anne, the absence of Karla (instead of a scene between Smiley and Karla we get only Smiley's tale of their encounter).  --But of course I am inevitably comparing the movie with the other versions.
All in all, if you have some background with the book or the miniseries, I think that comparisons will be inevitable and the movie certainly has not improved on either version.  At the same time, as thin as it sometimes is, the movie is worth watching. The acting is solid, there is enough suspence to keep things interesting, and the atmosphere is effective.  At the least, perhaps it will encourage viewers to read the book or watch the miniseries, both of which are excellent.",1333411200,2,4618,4.777917189460477

I hadn't read the book or seen the Alec Guinness version or anything.  All I knew it was going to be a slow, measured British spy drama and not to expect it to be all Bond-esque.  I personally enjoy a good plotty drama as much as anything with car chases and explosions, so I figured I'd enjoy it.  Unfortunately I come away from this movie with a resounding Meh.  It took me 3 different settings to finally get thru the whole thing because I kept wondering when something, ANYTHING interesting was going to happen.

Overall it brought to mind the Eddie Izzard bit from Dressed to Kill about British film:  ""But we've got known in Britain for making the smaller films, you know.... they're kind of ""a room with a view with a staircase and a pond""-type movies. Films with very fine acting, but the drama is rather sort of subsued and - subsumed or - a word like that. Sub- something or another. You know, just folded in and everything's people opening doors.

but I was hugely disappointed with this film.
now i knew before hand that it was a drama and had no action scenes, and that it was nothing like James Bond movies, and i had no problems with that because I really do enjoy most movies, even ones that moves in slow pace.
I just recently finished watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melancholia/dp/B005TJ7EFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melancholia</a>&nbsp;which was not a Spy film, but was very slow paced like Tinker Tailor and more of an artistic film which is not for everyone to appreciate, but i found it very enjoyable.

Sadly, Tinker Tailor was really really boring, it was slow paced and its major problem was that it was confusing and difficult to follow, I didn't know what was going on half the time, and nor how Smiley found the russian mole !
scenes were jumping from one place to another, and flashbacks were suddenly dropped within current events in the film adding much to the confusion,
I didn't read the book nor watch the TV series, which might have helped, but, if someone had to read the book to understand the movie, then the movie is a failure !

Now Gary Oldman deserves the nomination, his acting was top notch, and i also found the 70s feel to the film quite impressive, but the script really ruined the whole film for me despite these positive points.

the other main characters, including the ones played by Colin Firth, John Hurt and Mark Strong were poorly developed and seemed empty, i got lost between them,

there is a fine line between an intelligent film and a confusing one, and while Tinker Tailor tried to be some what intelligent, it fell short and ended up being a pile of muddiness,
don't get me wrong, i like films that tries to make you think and don't spell all the story out for you, but this one makes you dull rather than thinking because of its unclear confusing plot.

4624935,4,B0059XTTW8,"I really like this movie, although I preferred the 1979 BBC series as it was much truer to the book. The problem isn't the acting. It is first-rate. Unfortunately, so many other reviewers are right: too many shortcuts taken with the plot in order to condense it. Oldman, etal are all amazing, but if you are a fan of the book, it can hurt to watch how characters have been altered to fit modern movie sensibilities and a timeframe.

This I think is the crux of the movie's problem. If you love the book, or the Guinness series, you will keep up with the condensed plot. However, the compromises may make you wince. If you have never partaken of either, then of course you will have a hard time keeping up and/or understanding. I admire the effort and the quality of acting and filming. It is superbly done. Gary Oldman does more just with his facial expressions than most actors can portray using their entire toolbox.

I do, however, have no sympathy for folks who think James Bond is what a British spy drama should be all about. The British excel at character development. You either love British drama or you hate it. This is not a value judgment if you don't. However, please accept you may simply be out of your league passing judgment on a milieu you neither appreciate nor enjoy. The majority of movies made will appeal to you, so you should have little to complain about.

And anyway, Oldman looks so different from Alec Guinness's George Smiley that I thought it would ruin the film. Fortunately it doesn't; in fact Oldman makes the movie.

Simply from his choice of profession, we know that George Smiley must necessarily do evil things. Alec Guinness's Smiley shows his sinister side only once or twice in the mini-series, for example when he is questioning Ricki Tarr, he gives Tarr a very menacing look as he puts on his glasses.

Gary Oldman's George Smiley on the other hand oozes evil. George Smiley does evil because his job requires him to do the dirty work his government and his ideals command him to do. George Smiley does evil because in most cases doing nothing would result in a greater evil. Smiley chooses the lesser evil. No good man can live with this easily. Gary Oldman hardly ever appears kind or gentle. He bullies Connie Sachs with a bottle of whisky. He terrifies Toby Esterhase into tears. When he takes charge of something, he displays no satisfaction at being proven right. It's not generosity, it's simply an absence of any good feeling.

I finally realized that Alec Guinness is NOT George Smiley. He comes damn close but Smiley is a far more complex character that can be portrayed by a single actor in a single performance. Oldman does not offer a new interpretation of George Smiley, he presents a different side of the spy master, the necessary evil inner side hidden under the gentler face Guinness showed us.

While the movie goes it's own way in rejecting much back-story, the editing mimics a degree of the time shifting style of the book.  Yet transitions are poorly placed and you wonder if you merely fell asleep and missed a bit, which is possible, than witnessed brilliant editing.  The story simply isn't all that engrossing.  Smiley is brought in and assembles a team to look for a mole in the ""circus.""

Thats about it.  Few surprises and the plot, while edgy in the 1970s, now has been done over a few times even by reality in the form of Aldrich Ames.  The cloak and dagger bits are few and far between, though action is appropriately brutal and well timed.  The second half is far better than the first.

Performance wise, the cast is peerless.  To name a few, Firth, Hardy, Oldman and Mr Holmes himself, Benedict Cumberbatch give every ounce of credibilty you need for serious jobs like this.  Yet, there's still something missing.  While this takes a vote above disappointments like Breach or The Good Shepherd, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy feels like a dusty old overcoat.

John le Carre novels are not easy reads. Therefore it shouldn't surprise us that the film adaptation of Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy will move too slow and not have enough punch for younger viewers.
This is the fourth film made from the 80-year-old writings following The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, The Tailor of Panama and The Constant Gardener.
The mission has gone bad for Control, the head of British Intelligence (the Circus). Shortly after the operation is blown Control and his right-hand man George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced to take early retirement.
Control dies. Smiley is called back in, but not in office. He's to set up shop apart from the firm, pick his own team and go looking for a long-term mole. They believe this mole is at the top of British Intelligence, deep under cover.
Smiley puts trust in Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch - who you may recognize if you're a fan of the BBC's Sherlock) is head of ""Scalphunters"", the violent division of  The Circus that deals with operations such as assassination, blackmail, burglary, and kidnapping.
Oldman is amazing, able to keep viewers mesmerized with a single long stare, and comes across believeable of someone who has no life other than that of a spy.

How I wanted to enjoy this movie. I love the character of George Smiley. Reviewers are disparaging the portrayal by Gary Oldman, but this alone is not what keeps this movie from succeeding. In my opinion, the screenwriting team of O'Connor and Straughan intentionally abandoned the slow, methodical style of the Carr spy novel; instead attempting to recreate a ""Mission Impossible-thriller"" atmosphere. Unfortunately for the viewers, this doesn't work with the story. As a stage director myself, I often choose to have my shows play in updated, or simply different settings, but I never change the crux and core of the storyline as they have. For example, the character of Peter Guillam was not a homosexual in the book, Prideaux was---which is why he exacts revenge on Hayden. Control wasn't a decrepite alcoholic, he simply had a heart condition. Connie was a devoted and long-time analyst with the circus, who liked her drink, not a potty-mouthed wench. The serial-adulteress Ann Smiley is almost completely ignored, save for a really bad scene with Firth fumbling to get his shoes back on his feet. The Christmas party is still baffling me. Not only was there nothing of the sort in the book, it made absolutely no sense in the picture. It certainly didn't move the action forward.
I accept the fact that screenwriters face the challenge of taking, in this case, a very long and drawn-out story and condensing it into a 2 hour film.

4624969,1,B0059XTTW8,"The only good thing about this waste of celluloid is that it may stimulate interest in the excellent book and TV series -- the novel by John le Carre, volume one of his Search for Karla trilogy, and the BBC 6-hour miniseries starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.  In fact, if you haven't already encountered those predecessors, your chances of making heads or tails of this new effort are slim.

Other reviewers have covered the stone-faced acting of Gary Oldman, the confusing, non-responsive passages of dialog, and the dark, completely uninteresting sets and cinematography.  But the thing that wrecks this movie for me is the loss of any sense of the original story.

The novel is a wonderful progression of character and plot that reminds me of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen.  In the book, and the BBC series, the main character arcs -- Jim Prideaux, George Smiley, Peter Guillam, Ricky Tarr -- are mixed with explorations of the supporting actors -- Percy Alleline, Toby Esterhase, Roy Bland, Bill Haydon, Connie Sachs, Jim Roach, Roddy Martindale, Oliver Lacon, Sam Collins, Russian master spy Karla/Guestmann, and especially Jerry Westerby, who becomes the hero of The Honorable Schoolboy, book two of the trilogy -- in a way that leads the reader inexorably to the uncovering of the mole.

In the movie there is none of this depth and certainly no enjoyment.  In fact, it's as if the writers sought at every pass to remove elements that reveal the characters and their relationships.  Other reviewers blame the compression into a 2-hour movie, but that just doesn't explain it.  For instance, watching the movie only, you would never guess that Guillam is Smiley's old friend, the person he sought as a drinking companion after being dismissed as assistant head of MI6.  In the car on the way to see Lacon Peter addresses him as Mr. Smiley instead of George.  That was the first discordant note for me.  There were many, many others.

Other strikes against the movie include:

* Horrible, horrible casting.  While these are obviously professional actors and carry off their roles as written, compare the wonderful casting choices in the BBC series -- tough-guy Ian Bannen as Jim Prideaux, masculine-cum-sardonic Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Ian Richardson as supercilious, upper-crust Bill Haydon, the wonderful character actor Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby.  And of course Alec Guinness, the most gifted actor of all time, as Smiley.

* Unnecessary changes to the story line that add nothing, make no sense, and are ineptly done.  Perhaps combining Sam Collins with Jerry Westerby saved time, but then why dress Jerry up in a tuxedo, the way Sam would have been as ex-spy-turned-casino manager?  Never explained.  Why the shooting of Irina in front of Jim Prideaux while a prisoner in the Soviet Union?  They were completely separated in both plot and time.  Jim must have been as confused as I was.

* Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley.  From movies like Dracula and The Professional we know Oldman is amazing, almost always worth watching.  Here he seems clueless as to his chosen craft.  Smiley, as written and as portrayed by Alec Guinness, was quiet, but commanding and incisive when he spoke, a pivotal character.  Oldman is just silent.

* The complete waste of John Hurt as Control -- compare Alexander Knox in the BBC series.

* Peter Guillam breaking up with his gay lover -- in the book he is ostentatiously heterosexual.  An obligatory nod to Hollywood's politically correct gay agenda?

* Clumsily written scenes -- for example, Alleline's confrontation with Guillam over Tarr's reappearance in England.  Watch the BBC version to see the right way to do this, with little extra investment in time expended.

* Poor choice of music, especially at the end.  Bewildering, in fact.

* The MI6 office Christmas party.  Nothing remotely like that in the book.  And why, why, why have Santa Claus in a Lenin mask and everyone happily singing along with the USSR national anthem?  Why??

* The Americanization of the dialog by removing le Carre's use of British idiom.  If we Americans really don't know that ""sacked"" means fired, are we incapable of figuring it out?

* Addition of gratuitous profanity -- the s-word instead of ""chickenfeed"" when describing the Witchcraft intelligence material that bamboozled MI6.  Connie Sachs's use of the f-word.  Not in the book and totally unnecessary.  Possibly to gain a PG-13 rating?

* Gratuitous violence -- the shooting of Irina, Jim Prideaux using a sniper rifle instead of a karate chop at the end.  I guess American audiences just won't accept a spy movie without gunplay and gore.  I blame Sean Connery and Jason Bourne.

(One note of praise:  At least here MI6 has a decent-sized building.  The BBC production gave the impression they were in rented offices over a failing London bookshop.)

As this project proceeded, someone must have seen the disaster it was headed for.  I'm surprised le Carre allowed his name to be associated with the final product.  Was there a mole in the production company?

So, read the book and watch the TV series.  If those make you a Karla fanatic the way I am, then you may want to watch this hideously deformed descendant just for closure.  Otherwise, I suggest you skip it.",1332720000,85,5285,4.936435868331442
4624970,3,B0059XTTW8,"Silence can be commanding if you have any doubt listen to...nothing when the house is quiet how it seduces you almost like a crafty spy. George Smiley commands attention and respect by saying nothing. His enigmatic expression telling us...nothing. Gary Oldman deserved his Academy Award nomination for his performance in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" which equals the outstanding performance by the late Alec Guinness in the TV adaptation from the 1980's step-for-step and establishes that performance as unique. Oldman's challenge was akin to Dustin Hoffman's in playing the lead in ""Death of A Salesman"" after the Academy Award winning performance by Lee J. Cobb for the original film version. In other words, it was near impossible, scary and just this side of crazy.

Just be aware that the film is a bit slow in terms of pacing compared to most contemporary Hollywood spy movies and thrillers. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" returns to a the slower paced spy thrillers like we saw in the 1970's which is interesting given that it takes place in 1973. You need to be prepared that this film is convoluted without the rapid cutting style films typical display today. Patience is rewarded as is paying attention to this thriller which jumps back in forth in time.

It's 1973. George Smiley (Oldman) one of the leaders of MI6 and trusted ally of Control (John Hurt) finds himself dismissed after a meeting goes awry with an operative (the always marvelous Mark Strong) behind the iron curtain. After Control's accidental death he's brought back into the ""Circus"" (as MI6 is referred to) to uncover a double agent high within the command structure of the organization. Smiley must wade through the sewage of double and triple crosses, misleading clues and red herrings and try and protect one operative (Tom Hardy) that has been accused by the other department heads within the ""Circus"" (Toby Jones, Colin Firth, Ciarn Hinds, Devid Dencik).

""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" receives a sharp, detailed transfer with muted colors reflecting the ""look"" of 1970's films while still capturing the look of higher resolution newer films. Reportedly, this doesn't look quite as good as the UK release but I can't comment because I haven't seen it to compare.

Audio sounds terrific with a nice loss less presentation but keep in mind it isn't all that active as this is primarily a dialogue driven film.

I have mixed feelings about the special features. We get Q&A with the actors about the film and while interesting, it would have been far more rewarding to have a roundtable discussion with the actors. We do get a pretty engaging commentary track by star Oldman and director Tomas Alfredson giving us quite a bit of background on the making of the film.

We also get a short promotional featurette on the production of the film that runs under 15 minutes as well as about 7 minutes of deleted scenes. We don't, surprisingly, get the theatrical trailer.

""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is the type of thriller that rewards the patient viewer and it's a strong, well made movie. Goldman's performance is the center piece of the film but he's strongly supported by a terrific cast of brilliant character actors.  Having said that, this thriller might not be for everyone.",1332633600,,3265,4.977981651376147
4624991,2,B0059XTTW8,"Honestly I do enjoy spy movies and dramas. I couldn't wait to see this movie, but in the end it was so boring that I could hardly watch until the ending.",1332633600,,153,3.967741935483871
4624992,5,B0059XTTW8,"Okay, let's go ahead and get the trite yet obligatory comparisons out of the way first so we can put them behind us and move on.  Let it be stipulated from the outset that this movie is not as good as the John le Carr novel it is based on, or the 1979 BBC television miniseries starring Alec Guinness and Ian Richardson.  Having said that, let's get real for a moment:  No movie is ever as good as the book it is based on; and there's simply no way to pack as much storytelling into a two hour movie as can be packed into a six hour miniseries.  So, these sorts of comparisons are really unfair, and are not very helpful.  A movie should be judged on its own merits -- i.e. whether or not it is worth watching -- not by how closely it follows its source material or other retellings of the same story.  The only situation that would justify criticizing a movie for not living up to the book it was based on would be one in which the movie radically changes the plot of the story, or else completely misses the point that the original author was trying to make.  As long as a movie tries to be faithful to the novelist's vision, then the screenwriters and director shouldn't be criticized simply for making the sorts of alterations and abridgements that are always necessary when adapting a book for the silver screen.  John le Carr writes very complex stories; and no movie can ever hope to fully capture the layered intricacy of his writing.  Yet, in spite of this, some truly excellent films have been made based on his novels, the most brilliant being ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" starring Richard Burton, which is arguably the best spy movie ever made.  Even that movie is not as good as le Carr's novel; but it is a cinematic masterpiece, nonetheless.  So, let's ignore all those critics who have nothing more original to say than, ""It's not as good as the book,"" or, ""The TV version was better,"" and review this movie on its own merits.

So, when judged on its own merits, is this a good movie?  Is it worth watching?  Would I recommend it to others?  Absolutely yes!  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is wonderfully written and brilliantly acted.  And the director takes some creative risks that, at least in my opinion, really pay off in terms of setting the right mood.  Rather than trying to turn this into a fast-paced thriller, he lets the story unfold gradually, as it does in the novel.  Rather than explicitly spelling everything out in detail, he trusts the audience to be able to follow the plot, read between the lines, and figure out what's going on without having to be spoon fed information.  Rather than relying on dialogue to give us a sense of who the characters are, he makes creative use of silence -- often long stretches of uncomfortable silence -- that forces us to look beyond the words people say, which are often used to conceal the truth, and focus instead on the non-verbal cues that people give off, which paint a more honest portrait of who they are and what's going on inside their heads.  These creative choices might alienate some audiences; but I think that most John le Carr fans will appreciate them as much as I do.

As for the plot, the movie is really just a very condensed version of the book.  There are a few, relatively minor changes here and there, most of which are necessary simply in order to fit this expansive story into a two-hour film.  But you'd have to be the world's biggest nitpicker to fault this movie for these trivial alterations.  It certainly remains true to the story the author was trying to tell; and it definitely has the ""feel"" of a John le Carr novel.  If you've read the book, and/or have seen the miniseries, I think you'll be happy with how faithful this movie is to the original story.  And if you haven't already read the book or seen the miniseries, watching this movie may actually inspire you to do so.

The casting of this movie is absolutely amazing.  Gary Oldman gives a totally convincing portrayal of George Smiley, the quiet, world-weary spymaster called out of retirement to find a Soviet mole at the highest levels of British intelligence.  I still can't help but picture Alec Guinness whenever I think of Smiley; but Oldman's performance is just about as close to flawless as one could hope for.  If the filmmakers decide to make a sequel or two (it would be wonderful if they could do the entire Karla trilogy), and Oldman reprises his role, then I just might start picturing him instead of Guinness whenever I re-read one of le Carr's Smiley stories.  Oldman's supporting cast is also superb.  Benedict Cumberbatch (of ""Sherlock"" fame) turns in a stellar performance as Peter Guillam, Smiley's right-hand man (who seems to get more screen time than any other character, except perhaps Smiley himself).  Colin Firth (best known of late for ""The King's Speech"") doesn't really get all that much screen time as Smiley's old friend, colleague, and romantic rival Bill Haydon; but he sells the part quite nicely.  And the incomparable John Hurt gives what has to be seen as the definitive portrayal of Control, Smiley's old boss, the former head of British intelligence, who was forced into retirement when his obsession with uncovering a traitor within his inner circle led to disaster.

For those who are not familiar with this story, it's set in the early 1970s, at a time when the Cold War had begun to settle down into a shadowy game of chess played between spies and counterspies.  The old men who played this game had long since let go of any illusions that what they were doing was noble or patriotic.  It was simply necessary.  And, since the pieces on the chessboard were human beings, many of whom would have to be sacrificed in the course of the long game, the players had to develop a callous pragmatism and a cold detachment from the people around them.  In this world, secrecy was essential, suspicion was rampant, and trust was a luxury that often came at too high a price.  These soulless spymasters led miserable lives, with little consolation apart from the occasional moment of fleeting advantage gained over their opponents in the long game.  This is the setting for John le Carr's intriguing tale about the hunt for a ""mole"" (i.e. a traitor spying on behalf of the Soviets) inside the topmost levels of the Circus (i.e. the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6).  I don't want to spoil the plot; so I won't say any more.  But if you enjoy realistic spy stories (as opposed to the larger-than-life James Bond or Jason Bourne stuff), I think you'll really enjoy this movie.

As for the DVD/Blu-ray release, the special features are a little thin; but, let's be honest, you're getting this for the movie, not for the bonus material on the disc.  The movie is definitely worth having on DVD or Blu-ray, especially if you're a big John le Carr fan like I am.  I've always regarded ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" as le Carr's best Cold War spy novel (even better, in my opinion, than ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"").  So, I love this story and the characters in it; and I think this movie handles the story and the characters admirably.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it.",1332633600,3,7237,4.572093023255814
4624993,1,B0059XTTW8,"When 10 minutes has gone by with the opening credits still slowly forming on your screen, you naturally begin to challenge your decision to view this movie. After what seems several hours of obscure names, including an honorable mention for the kid who delivered the morning lattes, the movie plunges into a confusing and disjointed plot line understood by no one, not exempting the actors and director. Flipping back and forth in a coherent manner between past events and present day is difficult to pull off within any movie, this movie fails miserably at that task - the viewer is often confused over whether the current time on the screen is yesterday, 50 years ago or tomorrow. You, the viewer, eventually realize the movie is about finding a traitor within the British version of the CIA, although you also quickly realize their dilapidated British HQ is in dire need of a complete makeover. At a point a short ways into this ""who's the traitor?"" plot line, you will probably realize you actually don't care who the traitor is if only the story would begin to make some sense.

Perhaps fans of Le Carre understand this movie after having read the book, more power to you if the book was also this lethargic and obtuse. For those who haven't read the book, this movie asks veteran actors to give each other long dramatic looks consuming what can seem like  15 minutes per individual stare. This director's technique is meant to suggest drama but whether the stare is long and lingering, emotionless, quizzical or just plain bored, the constant staring doesn't make up for a slow paced, confusing  story which fails to draw the viewer  in. This should have been a movie for mature adults, no trick cars, no handsome James Bond type lady-killers but even mature adults deserve a plot you can follow and some skill at storytelling and creating drama. Save your money on this movie, you must have better uses for your time like re-arranging your sock drawer.",1332633600,11,1959,4.769911504424779
4624994,4,B0059XTTW8,"WHAT IT IS:
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is based on a novel by John le Carre (an expert Spy Thriller author); it was once before adapted into a television series; and now it's been adapted into a star-studded film by director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In--great film, by the way), starring Gary Oldman (who was rightfully nominated an oscar for his performance), Tom Hardy (Inception), Mark Strong (Kiss Ass), John Hurt, Toby Jones (The Mist, Captain America), Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Essentially the cast is the equivalent of New Years Eve or Valentine's Day, but with British male actors that target a male audience.

PREMISE:
As a fan of Christopher Nolan, I can tell you that I was lost a lot in this film. A lot of it was the terminology (Circus, for instance, which has an essential meaning in the plot, except I never fully understood what ""Circus"" was--and no, not a carnival like circus), but that's only a very small gripe. The essential story is that John Hurt's character thinks there's a mole and he dies and only a few people know that he knew about the mole and it was about the mole trying to cover up his tracks and Smiley (Oldman), who came out of retirement for this sort of personal assingment, trying to figure out who the mole is . . . and then Tom Hardy's character has a significant role, but at first it's hard to understand why he has a significant role (and explaining further would be a spoiler); so it's a cluttery mix of ""what's going on?"" premises. But that's the point, isn't it?

The point being--with the complexity of the story, the terminology that characters use (without really explaining them), and the essentially trippy way in which the film was edited together--it's hard to follow, and hard to understand.

MY THEATER REACTION / REWATCHING ON BLU-RAY:
As a fan of Oldman and Hardy, I really enjoyed their acting in the film. I knew from watching it (before Oscar buzz) that Gary Oldman was going to be nominated. But, even though I had seen the film during the day, I felt exhausted upon exiting the theater. It IS a slow film. There's some suspence, but nothing life-threatening. None of the character's live's are on the line, not for a moment. You trust Smiley to find the mole, and the outcome is predictable enough (although ""who"" the mole is isn't necessarily so predictable).

Then, on Blu-Ray, first and foremost, there aren't many features, so you might as well buy the DVD instead and save yourself a few dollars (at least I wish I would have done that), but if money's not an issue, then buy the Blu-Ray. It's just not one of the ""must have"" blu-ray movies, like Inception, The Dark Knight, Lord of the Rings--in other words: it has no ""awe"" moments and certainly isn't my definition of ""epic."" Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is just a slow-paced, complex spy movie (and I wouldn't even call it a thriller because it doesn't thrill).

CONCLUSION:
If you like tasteful cinematography and fantastic acting, then Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is for you. If your favorite director is Michael Bay, for instance, then you won't like this movie; and I'd almost consider that a fact.

But, if you're patient, and don't drag your girlfriend/boyfriend to watch the movie with you (because they may complain, unless they're very likeminded), then you may really respect this film. Although, to say that you'll ""enjoy"" the movie would be going against my better judgement. This movie simply isn't everyone's cup of tea. That's why the film itself wasn't up for a nomination. It's really slow. Good, but slow. Kind of like a weak tea before bed.",1332547200,4,3614,4.7194928684627575
4624995,1,B0059XTTW8,"It hurts to write this, but my favorite movie of 2011 has gotten an awful region A blu-ray treatment. About a third of the package is devoted to TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. The rest contains adverts for investing in blu-ray and NBC. Two of the features on the main menu are dedicated to showing off the features of blu-ray and if your blu-ray player is connected to the internet, a ticker streams adverts for NBC Universal properties. I use my PS3 and most of the usual buttons don't function as they should and if you leave the movie on pause for about two minutes or more, it starts playing a screen saver of the Universal logo that can only be turned off by hitting a particular button. It's also excluding a number of special features that are on the UK blu-ray. Apparently it's more important for fans of LeCarre to watch NBC's Smash at 10/9 central, than to have anything relevant to the movie on the blu-ray aside from one or two specials. The coding and design of this blu-ray is unspeakably bad and for such an incredible movie, I can't believe I'm even considering sending this back. Focus Features has an amazing track record with producing quality movies and they deserve better DVD and blu-ray treatment.

As for the quality of the film itself, there's a distracting amount of grain that seems like it might have been a stylistic choice, but it's really distracting when it shows up. This is a beautifully photographed movie and I wish the images were more clear.

The bleak wintery  London of 1974 is effectively recreated and with the exception of a couple of location changes (Hungary instead of Czechoslovakia for the site of ""Ellis'"" betrayal and shooting and Istanbul instead of Hong Kong as the site of Rikki Tarr's encounter with Irina- and the elimination of the ""Sam Collins"" character)---the essense of the plot lines do remain intact in the movie.

In reality, as author John le Carre could tell you, it's more of a waiting game: mundane activities backed but a sense of dread and anticipation.  TINKER captures this atmosphere perfectly, as master spy George Smiley comes out of retirement to track down a high-ranking KGB mole.

Atmosphere is key here.  Tomas Alfredson perfectly captured growing dread in his previous effort, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  He continues his efforts here, working from an Oscar-nominated script by Brigdet O'Connor and Peter Straughan.  Aiding him are some of the best British character actors of our time: Toby Jones, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Simon McBurney.  The anchor here is Gary Oldman, giving what is infamously his first Oscar-nominated performance.  Oldman's Smiley is proper and polite, superficially harmless; but as the movie progresses, and Smiley closes in on his prey, he becomes more and more dangerous.  It's a subtle progression, and one only an actor of Oldman's caliber (calibre?) could pull off.

TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY isn't for everyone.  It isn't a great film; like its source novel, it's a bit complex and dense (viewers will need two or three attempts to figure out everything that's going on), and casual viewers will be put off by the lack of action, and the overall ""British-ness"" of the film (yeah...it's a shame, but you know it's gonna happen).

4625029,4,B0059XTTW8,"TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a challenging cinematic interpretation of John le Carr's novel of the same name, This is not an action movie: this is a quiet study of how the intelligence operations of several countries function - slowly, quietly, secretly, mesmerizingly, and occultly. To fully comprehend the complex story it would be best to read the novel first: the film condenses a long tale into just over 2 hours and for the uninitiated this can result in a conundrum of semi-fleshed out events. But if you are in for an intense psychological drama that requires 100% of your attention then this is a movie to savor.

One aspect of the confusion that accompanies this film's story is the random uses of time changes - some things are shown in various stages of their development as they affect the story and some remain in the present, giving a time travel feel to the film. Odd little bits of action clarify this for the viewer: in the opening of the film George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is fitted for new glasses (a very fine bit of photography form cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) and that is the clue that when he is wearing his new glasses we are in the present and not in a flashback.

As for story it is fairly well known: we are in the Cold War in the 1970s and Control (John Hurt), the irascible Head of the British Intelligence resigns after a botched attempt to ferret out a mole in Hungary by sending Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a mission. Prideaux is killed. Convinced there is a Russian agent serving as a mole Control brings on George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to investigate a story agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) feels compelled to share. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding the mole. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco. And on it goes with the resolution of events offered to the viewer behind the same sort of shady gauze that hides much of the work of Intelligence.

The strong cast includes key roles by Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciarn Hinds, Colin Firth and Simon McBurney.  Though Gary Oldman's performance is definitely worthy of the praise he has received, it is the performance by Tom Hardy that sets a level of excellence to which all the other actors must strive to achieve.  Have a good night's sleep that night before viewing, a couple of strong cups of coffee, and stay hyper alert: the film is well worth exploring and digesting.

4625030,3,B0059XTTW8,"I found Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy overhyped.  It's a decent kind of film, but hardly something that's going to keep an audience on the edge of their seats.  For one thing, there are far too many characters and nuances to cram into a two hour film.  Much better for a mini series perhaps where characterizations can play out and actually mean something.  In spite of a strong cast, no one gets quite enough screen time except for Gary Oldman.  Don't expect excitement.  Expect to concentrate and then maybe feel a bit hmm.. about it.  Of course, John Le Carre fans may love this, but so much is under the surface that it's a somewhat humdrum experience.  Like that date that talks a lot but doesn't do much.

4625051,4,B0059XTTW8,"Former intelligence officer and British author John le Carre has seen seven of his novels brought to the big screen; Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, based on his 1974 novel of the same name, is merely the latest adaptation of his work. In a brilliant performance, Gary Oldman plays a British Intelligence officer who is brought out of retirement to investigate allegations that a mole exists within the organizations upper ranks. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has a great screenplay, score, and what I consider to be Gary Oldman's finest performance to date. Though I felt the plot was a tad difficult to follow, with its myriad twists and turns, the film is a rewarding experience, filled with nuanced performances and an engrossing premise. It's certainly worth a watch for anyone into high-stakes espionage stories.",1332288000,,815,5.135338345864661
4625052,3,B0059XTTW8,"It's impossible for me to judge the movie without reference to the book (an all-time favorite) and the miniseries (well liked, with minor reservations). On the whole, the movie is just okay, though it does have some strengths.

The movie is about 40 percent the length of the miniseries, so it's very distilled. No wonder people found it hard to follow. The movie is far more focused on Smiley than either the book or the miniseries, so you learn little about the suspects, and it isn't obvious, though it should be, who the mole is. The book is often categorized as a mystery, but it's not; everyone knows who the mole is from the start; they just don't want to believe it, and much of the character evolution is their coming to terms with what they've known all along. This doesn't work as well in the miniseries because we're less exposed to character thoughts and feelings. It doesn't work at all in the movie because the suspects are all just passers by.

On the other hand, the movie had a bigger budget and access to locations (Budapest, most notably) that would have been impossible for the miniseries, which was made when there was still an Iron Curtain. They even used a Russian actress to play the Russian woman who's the catalyst for the final unraveling of the mole's identity. Generally, the film is technically excellent (art/set direction, costume design, photography, etc.). The sets for the scenes at the Circus are outstanding--a grim, industrial place. Though the set for the head's conference room is a bit over the top.

Gary Oldman's performance is a major strength of the movie; it's an interpretation of the character more consistent than Alec Guinness is with the way Le Carr writes Smiley (more remorseless, less avuncular); each performance is excellent in its own way.

For reasons unclear to me (even though I listened to the commentary track), they recast a character who's something of a skirt chaser as a closet gay--not an objectionable change but rather pointless.

Other casting is less glamorous than the miniseries, with the exception of Colin Firth, who very much looks his age; the parts are practically cameos, though. John Hurt is outstanding as the desperate, dying Control.

The movie has more of a historical/period feel to it than the book and miniseries, which were written/produced much nearer to the time when the story takes place when the Soviet Union was still the chief bad guy for Anglo-American spy/thriller fiction. The disillusionment is therefore more remote, less raw.

The DVD includes a commentary track with the director, Tomas Alfredson, and Gary Oldman. It's a middle of the road commentary--not bad, but not especially entertaining. Actor commentaries are usually awful (Peter O'Toole excepted), but Oldman doesn't do too much of the ""so and so [a fellow actor] really nailed that scene"" kind of comment, so most of his contribution is informative.",1332288000,3,2913,4.9447852760736195
4625053,2,B0059XTTW8,"Poor George, as Connie Sachs would have said.  This movie has to be the most misconceived adaptation of a great book ever.  I'll tell you up front, I am a huge fan of le Carr's work of the 60s and 70s, and in particular of the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  The 1979 Alec Guinness BBC television treatment was a masterwork.  This movie, bluntly put, sucks.

First and foremost, the characters are badly cast and poorly played by (mostly) good actors who should know better.  In particular Gary Oldman as George Smiley is terrible.  He is made up to look more than anything like Lloyd Bridges after he picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue in ""Airplane.""  While Guinness became Smiley 30 years ago, Oldman plays the part without displaying the least bit of insight into the character.  William Hurt turns Control into a scenery chewer.  The nonentity who plays Peter Guillam looks 20 years too young for the part and the rest, including Colin Firth, who plays Bill Haydon without demonstrating any understanding of the depths of his character's complexity, just bumble and mumble along almost anonymously.  Don't even get me started about what is done to Connie Sachs.

Almost as sadly baffling is the completely pointless meddling the writers of the instant screenplay did with the sacred text of le Carr's book.  Czechoslovakia becomes Hungary...why?  Jim Prideaux is shot pretty much apropos of nothing but ominous music at a Budapest cafe instead of by Russian troops tipped off to his mission in a remote Czech forest...why?  Ricki Tarr dallies with Irina in Istanbul, not Hong Kong...the list goes on.  The changes in the main do nothing to promote efficient presentation, they simply seem like gratuitous, err...tinkering.

If you enjoyed the book or the Guinness version of the movie, please, please don't buy this completely unworthy effort.  Why le Carr allowed himself to be associated with it is beyond me, but then his books written after the trilogy do show a substantial decline in the author's clarity of thinking.  John le Carr lost his way in a series of increasingly tedious books written from the 80s on, but he was writing at the top of his form in Tinker Tailor.  Alec Guinness left us with the performance of a lifetime in a movie that defined the spy genre.  The 2011 version is, by comparison, a sad mistake that deserves to be quickly and mercifully forgotten.",1332201600,3,2383,4.849009900990099

4625071,2,B0059XTTW8,"I read ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" some twenty years ago. I don't recall all the details of the book, but I remember it being a beguiling novel (though I think that John Le Carre has written better books, like for instance, its sequel ""The Honourable Schoolboy""). The book is basically about taciturn spy George Smiley being brought back from retirement in order to catch a mole set by his Soviet nemesis, Karla, in the Circus (an alter ego for MI6, the British Intelligence Service). Now comes a film version of the novel, that roughly respects the plot (in 1979, there was a miniseries about the book, starring Alec Guiness as Smiley, which I haven't seen). The recreation of the era (the early 1970s) is fine, but this is one of the few positive things that I can say about this movie.

First, in this movie, Smiley is performed by Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable under loads of old age makeup (wouldn't it have made more sense to hire an older actor to play Smiley?).

Second, the movie is at times dull and boring and its tone is ridiculously somber.

Third, almost all the actors here perform languidly, as if they were making a parody of a British gentleman. Now, the cast includes many famous British actors (aside Oldman, we have Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and many others that are lesser known). These actors are usually fine performers in other movies, so clearly the filmmakers are at fault here.

Fourth, the plot is virtually impossible to follow if you haven't read the book (understandably so, considering six hours of the miniseries have been compressed to two hours).

Worst of all, the climactic scene when the mole is finally caught (for obvious reasons, I'm not going to say who he is) is, well, totally anticlimactic, to the point where the audience might felt cheated, after all the previous buildup (by the way, it is interesting to see that when the traitor is find, he is initially treated with kids gloves, as if never forgetting that while he might be a Soviet spy, he hasn't stopped being a gentleman. So, in a way, this movie suggests that postwar Britain might have not been very well suited to the ruthless game of international espionage).

So, summing up, a great disappointment, a movie that despite high expectations and high critical acclaim has in my opinion little to recommend for it.",1331856000,3,2353,4.754901960784314

However, there is so much that is missing and it moves too fast - it is very hard to follow, demanding on the attention of the viewer because crucial points are under the surface, and impossible to achieve the fullness of character and plot of the longer version.  Oldman is a truly great actor and was definitely up to creating a character that was not based on Alec Guiness, who was always old, but again the stamp of the original is simply too deep for me.

4625074,5,B0059XTTW8,"The idealized world of spy adventure which is the trademark of the James Bond books and films really has nothing to do with foreign intelligence. Unlike Ian Fleming (who wrote the James Bond novels), John Le Carre's vision of the world of spies came directly from first-hand experience. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Le Carre worked for British Intelligence and the British Foreign Service, taking part in wire taps, break-ins, and defector interrogations. This is a world of shadowed corners, darkened rooms, uncomfortable headsets, and endless transcriptions, not ski resorts and casino hotels.

Gary Oldman offers the performance of his career as the older intelligence genius, George Smiley, assigned to find the ""mole"" inside a branch of British Intelligence code-named ""the Circus"". A mole is a double-agent, someone pretending to be on one side but in fact working for the other who has burrowed himself inside the upper-reaches of the organization, allowing for easy access to classified information which can be leaked to the other side. When a younger agent, Jim Prideaux, is sent on a mission to Budapest to meet with a general supposedly defecting to the west, it becomes obvious the other side knew almost immediately about the meeting. The meeting point is at a caf which turns deadly when even before the meeting has begun, he is shot at. In other words, someone in British Intelligence had informed the other side of the meeting. Also, a another young low-level agent goes to the east and befriends a young woman looking to defect who claims she has knowledge about an intelligence mole.

Smiley goes on a kind of murder-mystery-like investigation to determine why the Budapest meeting became a fiasco and simultaneously uncover the identity of the mole. Each of the witnesses give their understanding of the story, how they are involved, and how each story fits into a larger mosaic of intrigue and betrayal. Part of the trick to navigating this film is understanding when flashbacks are occurring and when the film is in the present moment. The top suspects are all high-ranking British Intelligence agents, and given code names: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poor Man. When he identifies the perpetrator, instead of indicating them by name, Smiley will simply offer the code name.

An outstanding, if darkly atmospheric film which is a much more realistic portrayal of the shrouded world of foreign espionage. Some younger viewers may be frustrated because of the lack of action and the less than straight-forward linear progression. Each piece of the puzzle takes time to come to the fore. This film is more of a subtler suspense thriller rather than an action movie. Early on, many incidences are revealed without explanation at first. But if you can be patient, the film really starts to kick in at about the 30 to 45 min mark.

What we really learn is that the world of spies is ultimately about secrets. Who has them, who doesn't, and who doesn't want which secret to be revealed to whom. And all of the participants are haggard, spent people, not the glamorous icons portrayed in Hollywood spy thrillers. The skis, cocktails, waitresses, and roulette tables are strangely absent. Dim halls, unkempt studies, and damp cells are where these people reside.",1331251200,5,3280,5.0349907918968695

There's just no time for anything more. While Oldman is decent enough as George Smiley, he does not have the gravity Alec Guinness brought to the role in the miniseries -- given the distant, almost uninvolved way Alfredson shot this, he's not permitted to do so -- and, honestly, there's just too much missing, too much changed around or added to no useful purpose and too little atmosphere. (Scenes that were fraught with tension in the miniseries are perfunctory or simply inept here.) Moreover, the script too often lacks the fierce, literate crackle of Le Carre's dialog -- as though the writers were desperate to disassociate themselves from the novel and miniseries (which used it extensively) but unable to supply something equally memorable in its place.

I was correct. I saw the film out of curiosity, and because of the cast and director. I found the film to be fatally over-compressed. Some atmosphere was present, but character went almost totally by the board.  I was left with the feeling that if I had not read the book and seen the TV version, I would have had little idea, really, of what was going on or just who the characters were.

This could easily have been a 3 hour movie, and still much would still have been missed.

I really looked forward to its theatrical release and went as soon as it showed in my city.

The production is superb. I have seen very few modern movies that have taken such extreme care in a period piece. The details are exquisite and flawless. It even looks as if the film they used to film the movie was from the late 70's to early 80's. I grew up then, and the time-line details gave it a very authentic and reminiscent feel.

The acting is top-notch. Gary Oldman is one of the great character actors of our time. Colin Firth is entirely in his element as the upper crusty snob. John Hurt has been playing great bad leaders since his performance as Caligula in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius/dp/B006JY3OHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius</a>.

This is a perfectly competent rendition of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. It captures the essence of Le Carre's novel. The actors do a splendid job. But there is something that just falls flat about it. And I would probably think higher of it, were it not for the previous adaptation. If you've never seen the previous adaptation, you will enjoy this production more. I'm absolutely certain of that.

If your an invested fan of the original production or the book it will be impossible to not draw comparisons between the two adaptations. Its rare that a television mini-series can trump a film. However, all that makes this current adaptation good, was already done in the original. No actor could equal Sir Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley. That version looks like it was filmed in the late 70's as well, because it was.. And it has an equally competent supporting cast, including the great Ian Richardson.

I'm all for each generation re-interpreting great works for themselves and adding their new voice to it. But thats what falls flat here, there is nothing essentially new added to this production. It is simply a remake - not a new rendering or interpretation. This production is drafting off of the greatness of the first.

It's a solid film with great acting all around, particularly by John Hurt, Gary Oldman, and Tom Hardy. The writing is excellent too. And the on-screen tension is sometimes remarkable. But overall, this is a ""who's the mole?"" spy thriller with more similarities to a game of Clue than than the Jean-Pierre Melville style movie it wants to be. The problem is that director Thomas Alfredson only partially carries the audience's interest. At times the movie moves so slowly, you think it might stop churning out images. This is coming from one of those annoying moviegoers, who not only can sit through any film, but actually likes long, drawn-out scenes.

For the quickly distracted, think carefully before watching this. Yes, Tinker, Tailor has moments of riveting action and tense drama, but you will have to work for them. For those who like anti-Hollywood authenticity, Tinker, Tailor also has some powerful quiet scenes, but too often, those same kinds of scenes manage to miss the life-dense subtlety Alfredson so badly wants them to convey.

4625107,4,B0059XTTW8,"In the midst of Ian Fleming's James Bond ""spy"" romantic fantasy books and novels in the sixties came the real thing. John LeCarre, a former M.I 6 agent (England's CIA) then wrote the best and perhaps the only spy novels which accurately depict real spycraft. And one of the best of these is ""Tinker Tailor"", about Soviet Intelligence placing a secret ""sleeper mole"" (Russian agent) in M.I.6 headquarters, the Circus. Based on real events - Kim Philby was an agent in MI6 recruited by the Russia to spy for them.

Gary Oldman does a creditable job depicting the master British spy George Smiley, brought back from early retirement to discover the mole within their rank of the ""Circus"". Writing is, of course  first rate, LeCarre himself was involved in the production of this Cold War drama. The movie runs more than 2 hours.

But there was another version of ""Tinker Tailor"" where George Smiley was played by one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century, the late Sir Alec Guiness. For those unfamiliar with him, Alec Guiness played the superb Obi Wan Kenobi in the first released ""Star Wars"" movie! And the tortured British Colonel in ""Bridge Over the River Kwai""! And hundreds of other parts indelibly etched on the memories of movie viewers. Guiness stared in this spectacular over 6 hour production of Tinker Tailor which really captures the essence of the book and is the greatest spy miniseries of all time. Guiness was so good as Smiley, that John LeCarre remarked that when he wrote subsequent George Smiley spy novels he always visualized his character as Alec Guiness!

And that is the failing of this movie. In the six hour mini-series, the viewer sees each of the suspects clearly delineated and follows Smileys train of thought. In the Oldman version, all the suspects seem the same and many important plot details, even at a two hour running time, the plot is rushed. For example, when the ""mole"" is discovered, his interesting justification for why he betrayed MI6 and his country is completely missing from this version!

It IS ""Tinker Tailor"", Oldman does a good job, but so much seems missing to me....Authentic spycraft, this is what spying is. If you like this movie (or if you don't), buy or rent the Sir Alec Guiness version and you will be blown away!

Note: this is an adult movie. No spy car chases and gun fights will be found here

4625108,4,B0059XTTW8,"The acting is impeccable. Gary Oldman completely disappears into the
role of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a unique
creation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, from
thinking, not from action. Rarely have we ever seen a movie hero this
passive. But this man is very actively passive.  He may not move
physically, but his mind is racing like a computer. And Oldman is
surrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt,
Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc.

The film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beige
and brown mazes.

But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something got
a little lost for me. Smiley has to figure out who the mole in the
British secret service is. But with this much plot, and this little
time, we don't really get to know the suspects. So we watch and are
(intentionally) confused, and then answers start to emerge, and it's
all never less than interesting. But somehow it never crosses over into
the emotional or unshakably memorable either.

I loved Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' for it's uncanny combination
of atmosphere, creepiness, intelligence and heart. For me, 'Tinker,
Tailor..."" has the first three, but lacks the last. Some of that is the
nature of LaCarre's work. But somehow I remember more moments, and more
feeling from the now 30+ year old TV adaptation, even though it didn't come
close to this new version's rich sense of style.  But by not having to rush
through a story this dense, there was room to really feel and experience it,
instead of just working to keep up with it.

challenging film in a world with far too few.",1328745600,,1738,4.663398692810458

Even with those (rather low) expectations I was still hugely disappointed. The acting was first rate and the overall design of the film in terms of mood and historical feel was enticing. Unfortunately the scrip rendered the heart of the story meaningless, both in terms of plot and in terms of the point of the story. Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy in it's original version is much more than a ""who done it"" spy tale, it's a story about ideology and identity during the Cold War and way in which love and loyalty get corrupted in the face of politics and organizational corruption. The screenplay of this film fails to address these themes in any meaningful way, which is too bad given how superb the performances are by the actors and the production team. By the time the film ends, when the traitor is revealed, so little has been done to distinguish him from the other suspects that I felt I might as well have been watching a game of Clue and the thinly-wrought characters merely so many paper cards.

It was not at all faithful to the book or to the BBC production; there was zero character development; long scenes with no dialogue were painfully boring.

4625143,4,B0059XTTW8,"This 2011 Working Title Films production of Le Carre's 1974 novel 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' has attracted positive critical reviews, been generally liked by audiences, received some well-deserved award nominations and reportedly made a healthy box-office profit on its modest US$21 million production cost, so is an unexpected commercial success for the French investor StudioCanal.

Director Tomas Alfredson has delivered a serious film for an intelligent audience, but due to the time-constraints of a single 120-minute feature film, the result necessarily compresses the story so much that you need to pay close attention. A complex plot full of intrigue, double-bluff and the slow revelation of characters' hidden motives through real-time action and flashbacks means if you know Le Carre's novel then you'll be better placed to enjoy the film on first time viewing; if you're unfamiliar with the source material, then seeing the film a second time might make for a more satisfying viewing experience as the number of characters and complexity of the plot can be a bit confusing on first pass.

All the cast deliver fine performances with Gary Oldman in superb form as the world-weary but calculating and highly intelligent George Smiley, who has been called out of forced retirement to carry out a discrete investigation to uncover a suspected Soviet mole operating at the highest level of `the circus', the inner core of the UK overseas intelligence service MI6. Oldman has become a fine mature actor and proves here that `less is more', dominating some of his scenes by sheer presence, often with sparse or even no dialogue.

The 1970s period detail is pretty accurate with clothes, hairstyles, cars, interiors and the drab accoutrements of office life - paper files, tele-printers, manual typewriters, telephones, dreary furniture - setting the tone. There's not much color here, and the film's look is bleak and washed-out to reinforce the subject matter and the mood. The scenes set in Budapest and Istanbul look even bleaker and greyer than London.

The film is true in spirit to Le Carre's 1974 novel, so not natural Hollywood fodder. There is no `hero' (Smiley is a kind of anti-hero); all the characters are in some way flawed and none very sympathetic; there is little cinematic action, no gun battles, explosions or car chases. There is precious little humor, but it's not that kind of film. The few scenes of violence are brief and understated, casual and shocking but never dwelled on. The audience is invited to pay attention, to watch the characters closely, to listen to the dialogue and think. The duplicitous and closed world of the secretive cold war spying game is very well realised, and has little in common with the glamorous, fast-paced eye-candy of James Bond films.

If you like your entertainment served on a plastic plate with fries and fizzy cola to wash it down, best steer clear of `Tinker Tailor'. This is a film for grown-ups, and a more sophisticated palette will better savour its qualities.

There's a sequence in this dreadfully slow and boring movie that's worth bigging up because it's better than five-stars. I'd even go as far as saying that it's a serious contender for a top-ten placing in the best 'acting' ever put on screen. Gary Oldman has been almost comatose cold for most of the movie (as befits his character) - but then about halfway through the dense unfolding plot - he sits down with Benedict Cumberbatch (how good is he) at his home with a bottle of spirits and both get quietly blotto. Loosened up and now distinctly human, George Smiley (Oldham's MI5 character) then regales a story to Cumberbatch about how he met and sussed out a fanatical Russian spy. Oldham isn't just good in it - he's absolutely sensational. And the camera barely comes off him for maybe six or seven minutes. It's a huge amount of dialogue to remember and stay in the moment as he recounts it. If you're wondering why he was Oscar nominated - this extraordinary segment is surely the reason why.

Mark Strong puts in the best performance of his career too - there are times when I swear you can literally see what his character is thinking - beautifully subtle work. Colin Firth and Tom Hardy are superb also. The rest of the top-notch cast are the cream of British actors - an A-list to die for - and all honour that. But as you've probably gathered from a slew of one-star reviews (some of them even openly hostile) - ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" has still somehow managed to feel like having your teeth pulled - and without the payoff either.

And this is before you have to contend with the dire WASHED-OUT LOOK of the BLU RAY PRINT. It tries to ape Seventies ""French Connection"" like grittiness and it's just awful. It absolutely wrecks 80% of the scenes - blocking - blurriness. I know it's supposed to be a seedy tale about seedy men in a seedy business - but it just feels like amateur hour - you think you're watching some crappy pirate video.

As I say - it isn't all deathly dreary offices, grey filing cabinets and stale Jacob's Cream Crackers with your tea - as some reviewers have tried to claim. There are genuine moments of greatness in here. It's just that there aren't enough of them - and the main bulk of the feature is a stone cold drag (intentional or not).

Still - good luck on the night Mister Oldman - you thoroughly deserve your nomination and a win. I just wish the film you got it for had aroused the same level of affection...",1328140800,10,2483,4.460352422907489
4625146,4,B0059XTTW8,"""Tinker Tailor Solider Spy"" is an espionage genre film. Set in the 1970s Cold War tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union are presented as anxious with indications that there is a double agent within the highest echelon of the British Intelligence Agency.

The narrative of the movie concentrates on the meticulous unraveling of discovering who the traitor is.

The cast is absorbing with Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, and Mark Strong.

It is a classic styled spy film and the mild pace of the story allows the viewer to assess the many factors and variables in order to discover the truth. The speed of the narrative may not suit espionage enthusiasts who are accustomed to rapid fire movies like the Bourne films. However, this movie challenges the viewer to think, which certainly counterbalances any lack of speed.

4625147,1,B0059XTTW8,"After seeing this movie, you'll wish you had spent your time on something else.  The characters were not adequately developed in the film.  I've seen even positive reviews complain about this, but they attribute it to the need to compress the story to fit the film's length.  I don't think that is why though because there is so much time wasted in this film. When the end comes, you really don't know or care about the characters or the story, so it doesn't really have much meaning. The actors themselves did fine under the circumstances. But they must have been horrified at the final result.  It's hard to know who to blame for this, the screenwriters, the director, or the producers.

Don't be taken in by reviews that claim this is a ""thinking person's movie.""  What they mean is that it is a poorly made movie that if you really like the actors and put a lot of thought into filling in the gaps and poor editing and direction, you can forgive them for how hard this is to sit through.  Maybe the positive reviews for this were from people who already knew the story and characters from the book or a previous production.",1327795200,16,1127,4.495098039215686
4625148,4,B0059XTTW8,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy comes to us with an impressive pedigree. Director Tomas Alfredson previously directed a critically, and publicly acclaimed vampire movie Let the Right One In, a foreign language movie, now remade as Let Me In starring Chloe Moretz. If you don't mind subtitles I highly recommend it, and the remake.

Colin Firth won the Oscar last year. Gary Oldman, got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Mark Strong gave a great performance in The Guard, and Ciaran Hinds excels in playing spies, as in The Debt, and Munich.

If you're like me you have neither read the book, nor seen the series starring Alec Guinness, so my experience of watching it fresh might be a good indicator.

I probably would not have seen it if I did not accidentally meet someone in the movie business, who had seen Gary Oldman and the director do a presentation at their campus.

When asked how he would like playing a stoic character, as opposed to his often passionate characters, he said he had waited thirty years to play a role like this, that often actors don't get to pick and choose their parts, but take what is offered and to put food on the table, and hope one day...

As the movie begins, we become aware of a 'mole' at the circus, and an agent played by Mark Strong is sent to Hungary for a secret meeting to discover who it is. When complications arise retired agent, the stoic George Smiley played by Gary Oldman is brought out of unscheduled retirement to find the mole, the spy who despises his fellow spies. It's like a game of chess, with chess symbolism, where we read between the lines both of unfurling events, and Smiley's furrowed brows to gauge the churning depths beyond the stoic mask.

He has a wife we never see, who cheats on him, and we anticipate a break in that stoic exterior, so as a study of character acting by Oldman this is a wonder to behold. In a way this movie sets out to be deliberately dull, somewhat the antithesis of the impression you get from a Bond movie, these men are bureaucrats, they ironically sing the Russian national anthem at office parties, not much seems to happen, they're not particularly interesting or handsome, with one or two exceptions, then the action livens up with an intrigue, betrayal and occasional murder.

When the finger of suspicion points different ways, the 'circus' people suspected get very nervous, knowing full well what the outcome of that suspicion will be.

As I sat very close to the screen, close enough to see the dots, I noticed the rather grainy footage like the detail of movies set in that era, the 70s. While I enjoyed it overall, this is definitely a more cerebral movie than say Bond, in fact it reminded me somewhat of The Good Shepherd, a movie I love, starring Matt Damon but which has gained mixed reviews. I think they were expecting The Bourne identity, instead of backroom antics at the CIA, the other circus.

Several people around me left the movie early on, did not give it a chance, a yuppie sitting next to me, clearly on an early date, started immediately checking his iphone for other movie showings, was annoying, and thankfully they left shortly after to see a different movie. So this is not perhaps a date movie.

I would say that I did not understand everything, some detail was lost I think in reducing this to a two hour movie. For instance, he gets a lighter from Magda,which seems important, who I assume was a woman but apparently was not. From an acting viewpoint, everybody gives a strong perofrmance, from a directing viewpoint, if you're like me you probably want more action, then it would not be what it is.

I am now curious to check out the original with Alec Guinness. I think fans of Gary Oldman and/or Le Carre's original story will love it, and a varied response among other people. The movie also got nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.

I hope this was helpful.",1327622400,4,3909,4.592539454806313
4625149,5,B0059XTTW8,"The spies in Tomas Alfredson's artfully crafted adaptation of John Le Carre's 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy toil away in mundane offices. Most of what they type and read is a mystery. When suspicions of a mole arise, former spy George Smiley is called in as suddenly as he was forced to retire. Throughout the film, one wonders not only about the mole's identity but about where these spies' work begins and their emotional lives end.

Though hours shorter than the 1979 BBC adaptation, this version takes its time. The movie, like the book, often forces the audience to read between the lines. Its color scheme is as bleak as the story's Cold War setting, and the camera almost nostalgically observes the drudgery of sorting through physical files and writing with pen and paper. The soundtrack and slower pacing mimic movies of the 1970s, but the cinematography and editing are simultaneously inventive and retro.

This very believable world is peopled with chilly characters, played by an excellent array of familiar actors. Each is tinged with suspicion and a hint (or more) of amorality. Beneath even the more demonstrative personalities lie opaque motivations. John Hurt plays the paranoid and cantankerous Control, head of the Circus (the ring of top spies). Toby Jones does well as Percy Alleline, an ambitious spy who gets in a power struggle with Control. Toby Esterhase, a Hungarian working for England, is played convincingly by David Dencik, and Colin Firth perfectly fits the charming Roy Bland.

Mark Strong's portrayal of a haunted ""Scalphunter"" is especially poignant, as is Tom Hardy's disturbed Ricky Tarr. Also memorable are Simon McBurney as the bureaucratic but shrewd British undersecretary and Benedict Cumberbatch, touching as Smiley's young assistant Peter Guillam. Gary Oldman plays our unlikely hero, Smiley. For the first half of the film, he hardly says anything. His dull and humble appearance is impossible to read. But his low voice contains a glimmer of cunning. Gradually Smiley's skills of perception and methodical tactics show results. While unassuming and vulnerable, Smiley is also unnaturally calm, and aware of when to use either sympathy or implacability to get the intelligence he needs.

A few common phrases (such as ""bad apple,"" and ""trust no one"") pepper the script, but clichs are extremely rare. Don't expect these characters to explain why they sacrifice their relationships and moral codes for a tedious job that is both dangerous and thankless. Some likely appreciate the sordid fruits of their labor; others might relish the gathering of information. The older ones hang onto past glories of World War II. Some may not know.

The plot jumps between characters and time periods. It is not always clear who is looking for what and why. Yet this confusion adds to the complexity that makes up the world of spies and secrets. The story is confusing, but the sense of alienation that lurks behind the Circus's jokes and jaunty boys' club mentality is all too certain.",1327363200,5,3023,5.098989898989899

When I heard this movie was coming out starring my favourite actor, Gary Oldman, I was very excited...I love his movies.  But I had not read the book, nor did I know anything other than it was a spy movie about a ""mole"".  So I went to the library and got the book.

I stayed up all night reading it!  You could tell it was written by someone who knew the crafting of spies.  In fact John le Carr (real name David John Moore Cornwell) was a member of British MI5 and MI6 and was outed to the Russians by Kim Philby one of the infamous ""Cambridge Five"" who were Russian double agents.  The mole in the movie is modeled after Kim Philby in fact.  I won't say who and spoil it for you!

The book totally gives you a sense of how the movie will be.  Slowly building to the climax where you may, or may not be, stunned by who the ""mole"" is.

I hate when you read a book and the actor playing the role is in no way like how you imagined them to be reading the book, so I was very happy to see Gary Oldman as a very taciturn George Smiley.  I was glad to see he got a BAFTA and Oscar nomination for the role. John Hurt really makes you believe he is the slightly crazed Control desperately trying to find the mole.  When he is waiting to hear Jim Prideaux's news from Hungary, you are as resigned and depressed as he is, knowing it's going to go bad but wondering just how bad.  You see, they all really know who the mole is in their heart of hearts.

As another reviewer said, the movie does not introduce, nor develop, the characters enough for the people who have not read the book.  It may be hard for those people to get a clear gist of what really is going on.

But as I said, I loved it because now when I reread the book again (as well as the other books in the Karla trilogy - The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People) I can use the characters and the scenes from the movie in my imagination and flesh it out even further than I had before.

Gary Oldman plays Smiley, an ex British intelligence agent who's called back on the job when his former boss (John Hurt) suspects the presence of a mole in his department. You have to go into this expecting a deliberately paced movie that doesn't spoon-feed you the whole plot. It's not action-packed. It's not about the sexy gadgets and unbelievable action sequences, but the withered perseverance of an aging spy who may not be sexy or hyper-masculine, but makes up for that in sheer intelligence and mental fortitude. It would have been nice, I suppose, if this movie had been a little faster paced at times, and there's a certain Britishness to it that reeks of stuffy good manners, and yet the movie is totally absorbing, even when it's difficult to follow. It has an actual mystery to it, which is something you generally don't get from a Bond picture.

This is a great film, not for the easily confused, and not for the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE crowd either. It's the most labyrinthine film I've seen in YEARS. It is confusing and I felt that some of the characters weren't quite as fleshed out as I would have liked, particularly Ciaran Hinds, but it's a wonderfully stylish and quiet spy thriller packed from beginning to end with top-notch performances, particularly from Oldman as well as a surprisingly strong performance from Mark Strong. I've seen him in a number of films but never been truly impressed. Relegated to playing the heavy in films like the first Downey SHERLOCK HOLMES to KICK-ASS to GREEN LANTERN, I felt like I was missing something that so many others had seen. In TTSS, I finally got it. Also, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch do excellent work as well.

Honestly, I have not read the book, but I took my father, an avid Le Carre fan and lover of the ""Smiley"" books, and not only did he really enjoy it, but he also remarked that it held up quite well with the source material.",1327017600,13,1201,4.586046511627907
4625183,2,B0059XTTW8,"Save for the denouement, this was a film lacking in most every department. MI6 included.
A woeful screenplay and limp direction conspired to deal a heavy blow to what was the most powerful novel of its genre.
I, for one, had been terribly excited at the prospect of seeing Smiley brought to life on the big screen again. What puzzled me, however, was how Tinker Tailor could have been diluted to just two or so cinematic hours. I need not have worried; the attempt was a dismal failure and most likely was always going to be.
But, in the hands of this director what we did get lacked substance with what appeared to be a hurry-along to explain as much of the convoluted plot in the smallest amount of time possible.
This inevitably led to some odd and quite unrealistic scenes. The strength of both the book and the mini-series was that the reader/viewer could not possibly question what it was that Le Carre wanted us to believe. Not unless one had been a secret agent of course.
More surprising was the utter dilution of Karla. It may, or may not, be integral for the audience not to understand how mysterious and shadowy a figure Le Carre intended him to be. However, his presence in Budapest diluted and undermined very much the psychology of both Smiley and his Russian opponent. A bridge built, perhaps, for Part Three?
At the risk of seeming to be too picky, Ricky Tar's call to Lacon which ultimately kick-starts the whole kerfuffle is artistic licence gone completely balmy. I almost laughed out loud.
The film smacked of implausibility throughout.
Not only that, it was a complete mess.",1326672000,9,1596,4.663120567375887

A number of other actors also did a great job, including John Hurt as control. The sets and effort put into re-producing the cold war era was also also very satisfying.  It may also have been easier to find good Russian actors for the more recent series.

However, I must say that the cast overall didn't manage, in my opinion, to equal the quality of the TV series. This was particularly true of the four ""suspects"", especially Toby Esterhase and Percy Adeline. Part of the problem was the acting but part of the problem was the script which, in any event, did not manage to develop these characters. With so much effort/time into Smiley/Control/Peter/Ricky/Irena, and only 2 hours available, there wasn't much time left to develop the four characters who are suspected of being the ""mole"". Where the six-hour TV series has plenty of time to give the viewer time to think about (and care!) who the mole is, this movie just jumps to the conclusion too quickly. Moreover, few people will take the six hours in one sitting...watching the old series one hour a night gives you a whole week to think about who the mole is!

Given that both are based on the same story and ""give away"" who the mole is, I would suggest that people look into renting the classic TV series first.",1326672000,61,1386,4.626016260162602
4625185,5,B0059XTTW8,"I've long been a fan of John Le Carre's novel ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and the BBC miniseries that starred Alec Guinness as George Smiley.  The novel is very dense and I wasn't sure a two hour theatrical film could do the work justice.  It does but there is so much great character and story elements that had to be jettisoned I still wonder if a moviegoer who hasn't read the book will be able to keep up.  I'm fairly certain the patient and astute filmgoer will be able to, others may have a hard time of it.

TTSS is not a film for the ADD set. If you feel you have to continually text or talk during a film then you should stick to something within your comfort zone because this movie will plow right over your short attention span. TTSS is a film about spies in the '70's Cold War but isn't REALLY about spies, it's about betrayal, political and personal disillusionment and whether or not there is a clear separation between right and wrong. It depicts a morally bleak landscape populated by gray little men and women who work in a field that has an inherent moral rot to it to begin with. It's a slow and deliberately paced film that demands you pay attention to it. I know this doesn't sound like a positive critique but TTSS really is a film worth seeing. It's a rich film with many layers to it and you will probably see something new in it with repeated viewings.",1326585600,4,1381,4.341085271317829
4625186,1,B0059XTTW8,"I had not seen the 1970s BBC TV series, nor had I read the original Le Carre book. But I did see the trailer for this movie on a number of occasions in the last month or so when going to other movies. The trailer is outstanding from start to finish, giving hints of the big spy drama to come, with that deep voice whispering ""there is a mole at the top"". And then that all-star cast! I couldn't wait to see the movie.

The movie came out here in Cincinnati just this weekend, and I saw it last night. Oh my, where to begin? How about this: this movie managed to bore me out of my mind, for real. Things were happening on the screen, and as I was watching it, I thought to myself ""What is going on here? This movie makes no sense whatsoever!"". I truly couldn't make heads or tails from anything that was happening, and the movie did absolutely nothing to me. Gary Oldman seemingly moved from scene to scene but I didn't understand why, or what he was doing. All that great acting talent: Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, and on and on: all wasted for naught.

I see about 100 movies a year in the theatre, and I end up walking out of a movie maybe once a year. Well, I've already reached my quota for 2012, as I walked out of Tinker, Tailor about 75 min. into it, as I simply couldn't take it anymore and I realized I was wasting my time. A boring and incomprehensible mess is what this movie is, sadly.",1326585600,18,1417,4.149090909090909
4625187,5,B0059XTTW8,"Gary Oldman crowns himself king of the pregnant pause in the film version of John le Carre's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy."" Mass democracy, better grasped as government by talk, obscures the truth taught by Rabbi Avigdor Miller of blessed memory - ""It is the quiet man that is respected."" There is a Soviet mole in the British intelligence service (""The Circus"") but somehow we just know it's not George Smiley (played by Oldman). Too much gravitas. Smiley earns his gravitas by saying little and doing much (Shammai. Pirkei Avos 1:15). Thank you, Mr. Oldman, for proving the rebbe correct.
 ""Tinker, Tailor"" is full of the ambiguity and dead-pan humor that le Carre has been gifting to readers for nearly three generations (2013 will mark the 50th anniversary of ""The Spy That Came in From the Cold""). The author being one of the film's executive producers guarantees full injection of the book's best touches. Bureaucracy and camaraderie prove useful devices. The humor even registers in the names - Control (played strongly by John Hurt) is losing control of The Circus and Smiley doesn't smile. Le Carre uses an Anton Chekov-type pen in showing that Control and Smiley have hurt themselves as much as been hurt by others (Control with his inner circle, Smiley with his wife). Fittingly, they're run out of The Circus at the same time.
 Having had his one illusion shattered through Ann's infidelity, Smiley is the best equipped to find the mole. Swimming in the brackish water without removing his glasses is wonderful metaphor for Smiley's abilities and realism.
 Smiley's recollection of Karla is another compelling dive into realism. With the help of some drink, he concedes the brilliance of his adversary in noting that Karla carries a non-memorable face, a great asset in the spy game. Smiley admits Karla has a piece of him through possession of a cigarette lighter (""For George. Love, Ann""), hinting that Smiley's work nudged Ann toward infidelity. As viewers inhale deep thinking Smiley might be the mole, our hero quickly exhales for us in proclaiming Karla can be beaten because he's a fanatic. By extension, le Carre is saying an ideology state cannot last. He's predicting the fall of the Iron Curtain. That was quite a thing to write in 1973, the era of dtente. But le Carre has long been able to see further than most.
 Smiley and Karla rings a faint bell of bisexualism, another thing hardly considered in 1973. But take the notion of bisexualism and look at it through le Carre's long lens and you'll see the mole.
 Le Carre sports with the other giant of British spy fiction, Ian Fleming. Like Fleming's James Bond, Smiley also has a Walther pistol. But Smiley carries his around in a plastic bag like it's a dead rat.
 The UK's diminishment to proxy surfaces when it becomes clear what Karla is up to. Moscow is using London to get at Washington. Smiley bursts the bubble of the UK minister, who has the good grace to realize Her Majesty's Government has been a tool. If there's a flag-waving neocon faction in British politics, le Carre clearly doesn't belong to it.
 Silence becomes less prevalent as Smiley gets closer to discovering the mole. Cornered, the mole shows us the banality of evil. My mind chirped - ""You got all those people killed and hurt only for that?"" Such is this world.
 Smiley doesn't lecture or lash out much less gloat. He simply turns away and returns to his post, better girded for another round with Karla. The cinematic impact is awesome. Silence is golden.",1326585600,8,3511,4.830282861896839
4625188,3,B0059XTTW8,"Some film critics have given the movie version of Tinker Taylor high marks, but for me this long-awaited movie version was a sad disappointment.  Because the six-part television series (now on DVD) is of such high quality, I knew that the recently released theatre version would find the series to be a hard act to follow.  I saw the theatre version  26 December, 2011.  My concerns were fully justified.  In my subsequent discussions with a film professor, I had to clarify for him that my disappointment was not so much based upon the fact that the BBC series had the advantage of its longer length in which to more fully portray characters and personalities as well as more detailed and complete plot.  I evaluated the movie solely based upon its own  merits.  I thought at great length about every detail of the movie.  I finally had to come to the conclusion that everything remarkable and captivating about the BBC series is missing in the film.

To start with, the original book is of high quality.  Then, the television screen play is excellent both from the stand point of plot and with dialogue.  In the series, each character was perfectly cast for physical appearance as well as admirable acting skill.  The viewer consequently is able to gain clear insight into the individuals' personalities, characters, roles in MI6, interaction among each other, their strengths and their weaknesses.  The characters come across as real people whom the viewer learns to know.  Sir Alec as George Smiley succeeds in communicating more with his tone of voice, pauses, and non-verbal communication than many actors can speaking words.  For example when near the end he is asked to ""take charge for a while,""  the potent effect of Smiley's delivery upon the others at the meeting table is so memorable that I can quote those lines.

In the movie, however, some actors just did not look the part.  The individual playing Percy reminded me more of the CIA buffoon in ""Hopscotch"" than the stuffed-shirt MI6 director.  In the film, the acting was not always consistent with what the characters should be.  I have great admiration for the acting skill of Gary Oldman based upon his diverse roles which I previously have seen.  In this film, however, his reserved demeanor looks more sullen and uncommunicative than aware and contemplative.

It appeared to me that the screenwriters and director added some dialogue and action in an attempt to keep the story moving and to help the audience comprehend the story; however, these additions were so out of place that they stuck out like sore thumbs. Unfortunately, some scenes that were the most moving and impressive were omitted but could have been included with little additional time.  So little was portrayed of the character who turned out to be the mole that, when he was caught, the audience well may have asked, ""Who is he?""

In regard to the length of the film vs. the series, yes, the series does have the advantage of more time.  Tinker Taylor is a journey back into a different time, a cold-war time when the old-boys network dominated the intelligence services and time seemed not so rushed as it is in the 21st century.  The series permits sufficient time to allow for long pauses in dialogue during which the characters communicate much through their behavior and visual affect.  This is time well spent that any theatre version would be unlikely to take.  I have watched and shared the BBC DVD series several times with friends, and I never have grown tired of it.  My advice is to read the book and to see the BBC version.  I consider it to be my favorite cold-war spy story, and the quality of the series has much to do with it.

Addendum October 2013.  I decided to give this film version of ""Tinker"" a second chance, bought the DVD, and watched it carefully.  My original disappointment was only amplified.  As a stand-alone film, it fails badly.  In contrast to the BBC series, it fails miserably.  I suspect that more positive reviews are swayed by the power of the original novel and the big names in the film.  Do purchase the DVD series.  If I were to move and take with me only 5% of my DVDs, I would keep the BBC series (along with ""Smiley's People"").",1326412800,7,4216,4.73113854595336

Did Rolling Stone and and the New York Times send out the comatose former employees or what?!  Actually, this movie could have been great,maybe, but the editing blows beyond comprehension! It is hard to follow, and completely dull.  There is very little action in this film, the flashbacks are extremely hard to follow.

4625190,5,B0059XTTW8,"This is a movie that is essentially a time warp.  We are warped back into the seventies, when film was more grainy, the camera was actually steady, actors had substance, movies actually had a story to tell, and the audience was patient and intelligent.

By the standards of contemporary movie-making, when the first five minutes is usually an appetizer action sequence with a lot of explosions, this novel takes a really long time to get started, and the conflict slowly unfolds.  Gary Oldman does an excellent job of playing the understated George Smiley, who must uncover a Russian mole within the leadership circle of British intelligence while battling old age/insignificance and the loss of the love of his life.  George Smiley is the unlikeliest of all action heroes, and this spy thriller the opposite of James Bond.  It doesn't have the epic scale and consequence of ""The Good Shepherd,"" which was a great spy thriller in its own right.  But ""Tinker, Tailor"" does work, and is a rare breed of film:  a movie that stays loyal to the book while transforming onto the big screen.

What ultimately makes it work is the director's steady hand, his willingness and courage to test the audience's patience as he slowly builds up the plot, just as George Smiley patiently built his strategy to track down the Russian mole.",1326240000,355,1322,4.844444444444444

8463055,5,B0059XTTW8,"My favorite espionage film!

Director Tomas Alfredson crafted the ultimate slow burn spy thriller. Whispers and traitors are around every corner in this Cold War tale that is chilling. The crystal clear shots and cinematography transport you to another time. The period accurate outfits and makeup create a verisimilitude to the time.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a thoughtful take on complex spy narrative. Filled with political intrigue if you are willing to follow along. The music from composer Alberto Iglesias wrote the most beautiful and understated score for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. There is sweet jazz and lots of delicate piano melodies to listen to while you watch.

Notably, the acting from the entire ensemble is excellent and nuanced. You get the greatest Gary Oldman performance in his career as the ever observant spy Smiley. Oldman's use of his eyes and face to act make for a rather understated role, but he is brilliant all the same. You are constantly wondering what he is thinking. It is a master class in reserved acting.

Furthermore, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy give their most reserved acting showing their versatility. Colin Firth, John Hurt, Simon McBurney, David Dencik, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Ciarn Hinds, and Stephen Graham all deliver intricate performances to put you off who the mole is really. Svetlana Khodchenkova has a nice smaller role as a Russian informant that you will undoubtedly sympathize with by the end. All in all, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is well cast down to the smallest role.

In short, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is an espionage film like no other. Clever and twisting through the spy world. You will certainly have to think to understand this well written plot, but the process is enjoyable to the end. I love this film and I hope more viewers will get the opportunity to experience it.",1527984000,5,1853,4.983818770226537

I admire Gary Oldman and he does fine here, but the 5-hour miniseries with Alec Guinness is so superior in every way -- really, one of the best, most compelling miniseries of all time -- that you simply need to skip this film and savor the miniseries. Think of paring down the Lord of the Rings trilogy into one film -- you could do it, but it really wouldn't be fulfilling. It's like a 40-watt bulb compared to a 100-watt bulb.
