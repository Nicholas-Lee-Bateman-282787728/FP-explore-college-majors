7993048,5,B00009V45I,"I'm looking for a specific Johnny episode - August 2, 1976, which was guest-hosted by Roy Clark.  Guests included Glen Campbell, Will Geer, and Mel Tillis.

7993050,1,B00009V45I,"I was disappointed to find 3 of the DVD's from this set not included with the order. I only recived 7 DVD's, not the 10 shown on the webpage for the ENTIRE COLLECTION.

 The Ultimate Carson Collection, Volumes 1-3 from 1962-1992 was not included in this order.

 After waiting over a month for delivery, I was disappointed it was not the complete set shown on the webpage to order The Special Collector's Edition, which show 10 DVD's not the 7 I received.

 I have contacted Amazon by email & will report back if they send the additional 3 DVD's shown in this expensive collection.",1109376000,22,581,4.538461538461538
7993051,5,B00009V45I,"Now that he is gone, this collection will help keep him around despite that fact.  I have watched it several times, and shared it with numerous friends.  No matter how many times I watch it, I laugh all over again, enjoying it as much as the first time I saw it.  But even with this set, I can't get enough.  I hope there will be additional footage released to add to this collection.  There is so much material available, I hope many more sets will be released.  He will be truly missed.  God bless Johnny Carson.",1106611200,27,514,4.291666666666667
7993052,5,B00009V45I,"If you are a Carson lover this is the collection for you.  It contains the three disc Ultimate set that they advertise on television that highlights the best of three decades, plus six additional hard to find DVD's that feature some of the best shows.  The DVD's are designed and mastered nicely with lots of special features, including a behind the scenes tour, and a rare documentary on Johnny.  A terrific set!",1096588800,66,413,4.708333333333333
7993053,3,B00009V45I,"Joan Rivers is not on this format at all. It stats that she is but she is not found. Which is sad because she was the First and Only Starring Guest Host on The Tonight Show from 1983-1986. She was on more than 100 times but on this format she has been left out.
Sad...
I am sad that the full History is not on this record of the Tonight Show.",1055635200,42,342,3.8309859154929575
