8180169,4,B000NOKLX4,"I have take yoga professional classes over the past five years, but took a break due to money issues. My local library had a few yoga DVD's and thought I would give this a try.  I actually own two yoga DVD's.  My issue with those DVD's is that they move too fast. There are poses in Yoga that are meant to get your heart rate up, I got that, but there are poses designed to get in the pose and remain for a few minutes. Especially those focusing in on balance.  I enjoyed this DVD, the style is slow, soothing voice, gentle poses, twists, slow into the pose and slow getting out of the pose, reminders to breathe.  I don't consider myself an expert, but I know the moves so I can concentrate on listening. I am not 60 or 70 YO, I actively do cardio, weight training, HIIT DVD's, but I have learned to appreciate this type of DVD that promotes gentle and slow moves for the body.  I plan to purchase this from Amazon.  Also for Peggy Cappy...another good one.",1382918400,,958,4.236263736263736

from workouts with people jumping about, shouting.
Surprisingly effective.  I lose weight when I stick with
it.",1354579200,,162,5.44
8180171,2,B000NOKLX4,"I was extremely disappointed with this workout.  I am knocking 70 but I cannot imagine getting much out of these routines for another 10 years or so.  However for anyone who has not spent much time exercising, the moves are very simple and undemanding.  They may be better suited to convalescence or advanced years.  Those with reasonable body fitness are likely to find them lacking in challenge and unlikely to produce the desired results of significantly improved flexibility and balance.",1243641600,,491,5.1
8180172,5,B000NOKLX4,"I agree with ""doctor beth's"" excellent and thorough review.  I would like to add a different perspective.  I enjoy the gentle stretches and very moderate toning exercises.  It may be that I'm older than the previous reviewer, but I need this gentle approach to work out all the kinks in the morning!  And I feel great when I'm done, so I keep doing it, which I think is most important.  I have also done the stretching segment in the evening after a long day.  This is not an intense workout, nor do I think it was meant to be.",1188864000,5,527,4.2727272727272725
8180173,4,B000NOKLX4,"Dr. Lynn's Anti-Aging Workout for Every Body, Flexibility, Balance & Strength, is a gentle, yoga-inspired workout.  It is just under 54 minutes long and is broken into 3 segments, Flexibility, Balance, and Strength; there is also a bonus 6-minute Back Health segment.  Instructor Lynn Andersen appears as a very fit woman in her 50s or 60s, and she works out with four background exercisers, all of whom appear to be around her age.  Although the DVD case says that both a stability ball and 3-lb. hand weights are recommended, only the ball is actually used during the workout.  The DVD main menu allows you to select the full workout or to choose each of the three segments and/or the bonus individually.

The Flexibility segment begins with a 6.5 minute stretch.  This starts on the floor for breathing, arm reaches, and twists, moves to kneeling for a cat/cow series, and then ends standing with a side stretch for the hips.  Lynn remains standing for side swings and a standing forward bend, then goes back to the floor for bridge, a moving seated forward bend, half pigeon, and modified plank (which she calls ""platform"").  The Flexibility section finishes with some stretches over the  ball and comes in at about 17 minutes (including the warm-up).  The next section, Balance, is just under 24 minutes.  Lynn again begins standing, this time using the ball for lifting overhead, stretching to the side, and a partial squat.  She also uses the ball to modify yoga poses such as triangle and tree.  Next, you lie face-down on the ball for rear leg lifts, then do some seated stretches on the ball.  Lynn completes the Balance segment with two modified yoga sun salutations, which she describes as ""balance in motion.""  The final segment, Strength, starts seated for a twist with hands in a bear claw position.  Moving to lying on the floor, Lynn performs Kegels and core-strengthening exercises.  The ball is used for a pelvic lift and standing plie squats, and additional standing postures including forward bend, warrior 1 and 2, and ""bent tree,"" a forward bend with the legs crossed.  The last strengthening exercise is what Lynn calls the ""booty buster,"" a glute lift resting head/shoulders on the ball and then arching back over the ball to finish.  The final stretches include down dog, child's pose, and seated relaxation.

In the bonus Back Health segment, Lynn works out alone.  She begins very similar to the warm-up described above, but then lies prone for locust pose, rolls over to hug her knees to her chest, performs some reaches (crunches), and finishes with a lying 1-legged twist.  When this section is performed at the end of the workout, the entire session comes in right at one hour.  This DVD seems to be geared mainly to older exercisers who are looking to enhance their overall fitness in a way that is very gentle and doable.  The workout would also be appropriate for beginning exercisers and/or those who have never done yoga before, as the postures are generally presented in a very basic, modified manner.  I think that more experienced exercisers might find this video to be somewhat slow and possibly boring, although those who are interested in exploring yoga for the first time may appreciate Lynn's gentle approach.",1182902400,14,3254,4.894160583941606
