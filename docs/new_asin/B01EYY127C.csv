8759829,4,B01EYY127C,"This bargain basement priced Blu-ray with 2 William Castle Movies is really a great deal.
Both movies are fun.
The first, ""Homicidal,"" is quite a thrill and a surprise if no one spoils it for you --
In other words, don't do your movie homework before watching it: Just let it happen.
And a friend is no friend if they tell you too much about this film prior to your experiencing it.

It is an understatement to say that the film transfers are very good,
and the online reviews that I have read really do not do them justice.

It is surprising that these 2 films released by Mill Creek get such a professional look (and a high data rate, aka ""bit rate""),
but the recent Mill Creek releases of 4 Hammer Horror Films get a very low bit rate. Why?",1476144000,5,743,4.26241134751773

8759831,4,B01EYY127C,Very enjoyable for what it is.,1472860800,,30,4.166666666666667
8759832,4,B01EYY127C,A very good no frills double-bill for William Castle fans. This is a Zone A product so a suitable only for appropriate players. The movies themselves are excellent example of Castle's approach to horror with 'Homicidal' having a' Fright Break' before the finale so only brave viewers will keep their seats (all of us in fact as nobody would wish to leave at such a point) and 'Mr Sardonicus' having a 'Punishment Poll' before the end where Castle seemingly counts the audience votes to see whether Sardonicus should be punished or not (in fact only one ending was ever shot as we the audience would only vote to punish Sardonicus for his evil deeds). Modern viewers and some older ones may not like such intrusions by Castle but they are all part now of cinematic history. The movies themselves are entertaining and they have never looked better than in this blu ray package with original mono sound. No extras for either movie. Highly recommended for Castle fans.,1471651200,8,964,4.778443113772455
