8119364,5,B000F9TCRS,"FYI-The copies being sold on amazon are bootleg copies from vas entertainment.
They have no legal rights with the film/filmmaker. That is why they are being sold
for near nothing. Unfortunately, they've been trying to liquidate these copies here.
Legit copies are being sold from ""Skater Made"".

Take note of film poachers.",1297987200,,323,5.211538461538462
8119365,5,B000F9TCRS,"There was something special about the 1980's/early 90's skate scene. Although this film features the obvious skating and tattoos, it also serves as a ""where are they now"" (of sorts) for certain key figures of said scene. A nice history lesson for today's skate rats. I enjoyed this film immensely and will surely watch it again and again. I was happy to see a couple Alva guys in this (Fred Smith and Bill Danforth). Someone needs to do a documentary on that entire team, assuming none of them became born again Christians.",1212624000,2,523,4.695652173913044
