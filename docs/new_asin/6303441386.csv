645957,2,6303441386,"I bought this for my 3 year old grand daughter, but after watching it, decided not to let he see it.

The language and antics are really not for children that young, especially the name-calling of the character that has a facial problem.",1224028800,2,237,4.511627906976744
645958,5,6303441386,"As always, watching anything with Alvin and the Chipmunks takes you right back to your own youth, but the grandkids love Alvin and the boys equally as much. They just don't make a lot of Halloween videos for the kids these days and Trick or Treason was perfect: festive, interesting, action packed.",1222300800,,298,4.75
645959,5,6303441386,"My kids love this video!  There are 5 or 6 episodes from the old cartoon series on this dvd.  Halloween is very big at our house, so the kids were happy to see that there was a collection of just the Halloween/spooky episodes.  We have several of the Alvin and the Chipmunks dvd's and this one is by far the kids favorite.  My youngest daughter is two and she loves this as well, so this is a good one for the younger kids as well.",1221868800,,431,4.035294117647059
645960,5,6303441386,Kids loved it.  We rented this movie so many times that we finally decided to buy.  The kids watch it all year round.,1183420800,3,117,4.043478260869565
645961,3,6303441386,"Chip and Dale aren't the only squeaky-voiced chipmunks in the realm of animation.  Around the same period these two critters were born out of the Disney studio, another trio would challenge their position--Simon, Theodore, and the ever-irrepressible scamp, Alvin. Creations of musician Ross Bagdasarian (who, incidentally, had the stage name of David Seville, the mild-mannered human who ""fathers"" the chipmunks), these three have amused many through their numerous record albums and television shows.

This DVD compiles several episodes from the 1980's series, as well as a 1994 Halloween special, ""Trick or Treason"", in which egocentric Alvin aspires to be part of a monster club while Theodore strikes up a friendship with a malformed, misunderstood boy.  This special, capped off by a kitschy ""Chipmunk"" rendition of ""Monster Mash"" is probably the best on the disc, with solid production values, humor, and a couple of nice (albeit predictable) twists.  (Considering it is a 1994 production, such polish is to be expected.)

On the other hand, the remaining episodes (where the ""boys"" deal with a seemingly menacing babysitter, a monster movie, practical jokes, and nightmares) are a mixed bag.  For kids unfamiliar with Alvin and company from the '60s or the curious, this is passably entertaining fare.  Unfortunately, my mother (who had grown up with the ""old"" Alvin), found these latter episodes to be uninspired and predictable--with production values on par with, well, an 80's TV cartoon and only a number of mildly amusing moments.  It's not bad stuff for Halloween or a rainy day, all in all, but Alvin, Simon, and Theodore have had better outings--try THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE or A CHIPMUNK CHRISTMAS instead.",1166486400,7,1721,5.301470588235294
645962,3,6303441386,"Attention nostalgia fans-

If you buy these old cartoons partly for nostalgia, like I do, then you know that being able to see the original opening sequence of the show is all important.  It's what you remember most about the show.  However, while these are episodes from the 1980s ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" cartoon show, these episodes do NOT contain the original opening sequence that started the show.  The theme song is there, but it's not the same animated opening sequence.  They instead substituted it for some other sequence that I didn't recognize.  So, if you want to see the original opening of this cartoon show, you may want to wait for another DVD or DVD set to come out.",1162684800,3,685,4.666666666666667
