6453990,5,B00KYNR1HI,"I loved the 10th Doctor and Donna is still my favorite companion of the Doctor! Of course, this series part is great because the finale to Series 4 has everybody in 10's run show up and help save the day!",1411257600,2,204,4.125
6453991,1,B00KYNR1HI,"BBC Video has produced some great bonus features for many of their shows.  ""Red Dwarf"" and many of the classic ""Doctor Who"" DVDs include great, thorough, viciously candid making-of documentaries.  When I heard that BBC Video was coming out with brand new bonus material for their new half-season DVD sets of the David Tennant years, I was quite excited and willing to try a double-dip.

Turns out I should have saved my money.  The only bonus feature included is a very thin 20-minute documentary where David Tennant, Catherine Tate, and Alex Kingston summarize parts of the episodes.  It's not even new interviews.  It's old promotional interviews from back when they made the episodes.

If you want a quick, cheap burst of ""Doctor Who"" on DVD, this is a fine purchase.  But for collectors & hard-core Whovians, you're better off sticking with the full-season sets.",1411171200,,866,4.965277777777778
6453992,5,B00KYNR1HI,"The second half of David Tennant's last season as The Doctor, Doctor Who Series Four Part Two is where it's at.  We get more of Donna (yay!) and Martha (ugh!), plus a few other familiar faces (see spoilers).  Also, the incredible River Song is introduced in the riveting two-part story ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead.""  Count the shadows!  ;-)  Also, don't miss what is in my opinion the most terrifying episode of Doctor Who: ""Midnight.""

The only problem is that, except for the Specials, this is the last you'll see of the Tenth Doctor.  His hour is drawing close, and he will knock four times...

SPOILERS: The two-part season finale brings all of the Doctor's former and current companions together as well as Captain Jack Harkness and Torchwood, plus Rose makes a return from her parallel universe! The Daleks do their worst, and one of the companions isn't going to survive... I freely admit her fate makes me cry every time.",1410307200,3,950,4.715151515151515

6453995,1,B00KYNR1HI,We ordered this DVD to watch the last half of season 4 while traveling.  This DVD does NOT include the season finale as well as two of the seasons specials.  I am still perplexed why the season finale was not included.  I noticed Amazon offers the final  2 part episode on a separate DVD for $12.,1441843200,3,296,4.232142857142857

6453997,5,B00KYNR1HI,"Loving Hartnell, Troughton,Pertwee,etc,I was wondering how they would muck up a classic! Despite the special effects and wobbly doors, the original series is a classic for a reason! Strong characterization, story's that you kinda had to think about.that's what makes a classic,the fugitive,I spy ,combat(nothing beats combat for realism),and the voice of God, and God doesn't care existentialism philosophy behind the fugitive,the fact that African American s are people too (which DNA computers tell us every race is only one race at99.9 percent) so I spy was right !it helps if a classic has a timeless message, (see Campbell's the power of the myth, or Jungs modern man in search of a soul)it's genetically hard wired in or SOULS to believe that good over comes evil(read stupidity, and greed ) people need to believe in something,anything! The deifacation ,of Reagan and Thatcher proves Sagan was right about obedience to authorities(look at greece and the global economy ,greed rules for now. But along comes the new Doctor who, I must admit I caught myself chocking up over and over through Tennants adventures,melodrama,sentimentalism ,I admit! but d--m good stories ,characters special effects,excellent as the cybermen would say! I was really surprised that Tennant left, and wondering how could he be replaced,good luck prevailed, and Smith has left quite an impression,(haven't chocked up as much as Tennants story's ,but still an excellent job,deserves to become a classic like the original series! The hints at atheism are kept down (dosent anyone do research like Virginia with the late dr. Stevenson,and Tucker? How do you explain a 124iQ in a case of hydroencephlious?)still it's kept down ,so it's a very family friendly show, I'm not surprised it's so popular ,hope it lasts another 50 years!!!",1439942400,,1812,5.251724137931035
6453998,5,B00KYNR1HI,"Good if you don't have the money to get the complete series sets, but I miss the Dr. Who Confidentials and DT's own videos. Plus I love Donna as his companion, more fun, less 'tension' without Martha.",1438387200,,200,4.4324324324324325
