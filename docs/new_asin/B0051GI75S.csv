I caught this on Public Television and I have to say this is an awesome documentary. It focuses on the rise of the African American population in Chicago in the early part of last century, and how due to segregation made drive made the African American neighborhoods in Chicago and thriving self sufficient metropolis within a metropolis. My favorite part was the tangent on how African Amerians at the time became aviation hobbyists, taking it upon themselves to learn to fly single engine planes and in one case building a working aircraft from a discarded manual. This tangent also explores how John Robinson a local African American piolot acted as a one man airforce for Ethiopia during the Italian Invasion of Ethiopia during WWI and made it home in 1 piece. I highly recommend this historical vid for history buffs of all ages and races.
