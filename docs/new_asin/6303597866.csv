689876,4,6303597866,"""Indictment: The McMartin Trial"" is an excellent film. I do not live very far from Manhattan Beach, and was once a junior lifeguard there. I still jog and bicycle down there when I get the chance. I do remember very vividly when these events occurred. One of the things that I don't know is whether or not the children were molested. However, I do remember how nearly everyone where I worked at the time presumed these people were guilty. Even the LA Times showed unflattering pictures of the accused. Therefore, I do believe that there was a frenzied and carnival-like demonizing of the McMartin family. The film itself is very good. (James Woods) gives an outstanding performance as the attorney who defends the McMartin family.

There is no doubt in my mind that the public hysteria over the allegations this family was charged with, and the media hype, were responsible for a grave miscarriage of justice. I feel for the children too: As they were equally victims of an out-of-control legal system that failed them too! Mercedes Ruehl also gives an outstanding performance as the lead prosecutor who abused the power she was given. Her performance as the win-at-all-costs prosecutor, was absolutely stellar. Ruehl's character compliments the performance given by defense attorney Danny Davis (James Woods).

Moreover, the entire cast was great in this film. With Henry Thomas [of ET fame] as the son accused of several counts of molestion; which would result in the longest trial ever; along with actress Shirley Knight, as the mother; and Sada Thompson as the matriarch of the family, this is one great film. And one sad chapter in the California legal system. Also, Lolita Davidovich gives an excellent performance as the prosecutors main line of attack in the molestation charges against the McMartin family: As her taped videos of the children led to many of the initial charges against the McMartins. The film is an HBO released film, therefore, as with many of their films it is not anamorphic or letter-boxed, but full screened. Maybe someday the film will be released in a better format. Otherwise, this is a 5 star film. Only the DVD format gives it minus half a star. Highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5]",1163462400,19,2214,4.932975871313673
689877,5,6303597866,"HBO really outdid themselves with this one! The riveting story of the McMartin Pre-School tragedy is delivered with a knock-out punch! The story centers around the molestation charges hurled at the infamous Manhattan Beach pre-school, where head maven Virginia rules with either an iron fist or a mother's heart (depending which side you choose to believe) from her wheelchair. Joining Ma McMartin is her daughter Peggy and her grandchildren, Ray and Peggy Ann. There are also special appearances by Betty Radar and Babette Spitzler. James Woods delievers an inspiring performance as Ray's attorney, while Mercedes Rhuel & Lolita Davidovich play the ""villians,"" Lael Rubin and loose Kee MacFarlane. The film really gets to the heart of the argument that if ""children say it is true, they must be believed."" I went to school with a guy named FC Gaybo and he knew Kee personally. He said she'd sleep with anything on 2 legs, but that ""children don't lie about these types of things."" I found this quite an ignorant statement. It is also to note that the writers, Abby & Myra Mann had their home burned to the ground. Insanity! The film is campy too. Watch out for hilarious references to the Alligator Game and (my fave) Naked Movie Star (wish I knew how to play that!). The film also demonstrates the level of paranoia that engulped everyone involved. The mother of the first accuser (a drug addicted psychotic) hits the bottle and makes outrageous claims that the family dog was molested and that she is ""Jesus Johnson""! Keep an eye out for Peggy's body cavity search scene!",1070496000,9,1574,4.876865671641791
689878,5,6303597866,"Too bad only one side of this story was ever turned into a movie. I would consider it a powerful piece of government propaganda, playing on the incredulity of an audience that would rather not believe the history of this very kind of abuse far beyond what this case attempted to handle ... particularly since it was one of the first to attempt to make its way through the courts.
If one believes everything they see in a movie as the truth, one comes away believing that a terrible injustice has been done. James Woods was, indeed, magnificent as the lawyer defending the accused McMartin clan; as was Mercedes Reuhl as the prosecuting attorney. The McMartin's were portrayed as hapless, innocent victims of a hysterical media circus and Kee MacFarlane was portrayed as ignorant, manipulative and overtly sexy -- bad, boo! evil!
They show you what they want you to see, and so many people have bought it, hook, line and sinker. The children have grown up, their memories intact, and those who survive, continue to suffer and struggle with their healing, moreso because of how the media betrayed them. The children know what this movie could not possibly reveal, they knew it then, and they know even more today.
Someone should make a movie telling *their* story. Not the lawyers, not the accused, not the media, but the children, who are children no longer. It's as if the charges never existed, and the children never existed either.
The fact of the matter is they did, and they still do, as do hundreds of children who were caught up in the nightmare of trafficking in children for nefarious purpose that existed then, and continues to exist today, now in the thousands, globally.
We have a better understanding of this entire phenomenon now, and it is incumbent on all of us to understand the story that is unfolding here so that we can finally put an end to it.

689879,4,6303597866,"This account of the most celebrated trial arising out of the child molestation and satanic abuse hysteria of the eighties and nineties-a witch  hunt far worse than that of the McCarthy era in terms of lives destroyed  and innocent people thrown in jail, and even worse than the Salem witch  trials of the 17th century in extent, except that nobody was actually  stoned or hanged, was only the tip of the iceberg.  Hundreds of innocent  people went to jail and some are still there.  Nobody can give them back  their lives, ruined by immoral prosecutors bent on career-building at any  cost and by guilt-ridden latch key parents out to excite their blood lust.  Yes, children do lie and more important, as this film demonstrates, they  can be brainwashed and coerced into telling the most outrageous and  horrific tales (and believing them) to escape the gestapo tactics of their  interrogators.

  Oliver Stone produced, and Abby Mann, who wrote the  celebrated Stanley Kramer film, ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" (1961) and Myra  Mann penned the compelling script.  James Woods is excellent as Ray  Buckey's attorney, but Lolita Davidovich who plays the evil and sick Kee  MacFarlane (who led the indoctrination of the children) is both too pretty  and too sane to be truly effective.  Mercedes Ruehl plays incompetent L.A.  County prosecutor Lael Rubin with enough vile to drip.  Sada Thompson  brings warmth and charm to the part of Virginia McMartin, and Henry Thomas  plays Ray Buckey to a perfect fit.

But this movie was made too soon.  In  the five years since its production, the full extent of  the hysteria has  come to light.  When a significant portion of a society is taken in by  something like this, it takes the passage of time before the full truth can  be accepted.  Had director Mick Jackson known of the near pandemic extent  of the sickness he might have made a larger film. As it is, this is a vivid  and compelling film.

This movie clearly shows that an injustice was done and that the Justice  System of the US isn't infallable.  The defendant's lost everything because  of the LA District Attorney's Office, and it amazes me that anybody could  have believed any of the children the way they kept changing their stories.

690048,5,6303597866,"Great movie about the McMartin Preschool Trial. In the 1980s Judy Johnson went to the Manhattan Beach Police Department and filed a complaint stating that Ray Buckey, an employee and the grandson of the owner of the McMartin Preschool, had molested her 2 year old son. Then more children were interviewed by an unqualified therapist, Key McFarlane and suddenly hundreds of children were making allegations against all of the staff at the McMartin Preschool, including Ray Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, his sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, his grandmother, Virginia McMartin and 3 other women who used to work at the McMartin Preschool. The allegations were totally off the wall, including being flown to Palm Springs to watch Ray sacrifice a rabbit in a church and then being forced to drink the rabbit blood. On the tapes Key McFarlane won't take no for an answer, If the child said they weren't molested she ridicules them until they say that they were. I feel so bad for the McMartin/Buckey family. They did nothing wrong but were jailed, treated like pariahs and lost everything they owned. Judy Johnson, the woman who started all of this, was an alcoholic and a paranoid schizophrenic. What actually happened was that Johnson's son was abused by his father but because of her delusions Judy Johnson blamed Ray Buckey and the rest of the McMartin Preschool Staff",1478476800,3,1369,4.9825327510917035

690518,5,6303597866,"This was a 'fabulous' movie, very well done, based on a true story. James Woods was great as usual, as were the other 'key' actors/actresses. I have read the critical reviews of this movie and find them to be weak overall. For me personally, the most horrific of crimes are those against children (child abuse, neglect) and others (domestic violence). Some have said of this movie that it reverses the roles of victim and perpetrator, meaning the accused (and alleged) abusers are painted as victims and the alleged victims (the children, their families) as perpetrators. I do not see it that way. Those operating and working at the school were accused of one of the most heinous of crimes---pedophilia. However, the accusations were based on very little evidence. The woman who interviewed the children---the woman holding a Social Work degree only---presented questions in such a biased and leading fashion with the children that it was disgusting. And it was pretty clear that the lead prosecutor in the case had political aspirations that 'winning' a case/trial such as this would ostensibly bolster. I am very grateful that her nomination to the supreme court (I assume supreme court of the State of California, not federal) was not accepted. Supposedly there was a time in this country when you were innocent until proven guilty. If there was such a time, it is no more. Now the 'average Joe' is presumed guilty until s/he is proven innocent. The law and justice systems in this country are indeed broken. Don't expect them to be improved any time 'soon'.

Basically, when something terrible happens, be it child abuse, domestic violence (male or female), murder, etc, the public & press puts tremendous force on the police/DA to come up with the guilty party.

Unfortunately this 'rush to judgement' mentality has often resulted in an innocent person(s) being charged, their reputation ruined, and years spent behind bars.

One can only imagine the McMartins' horror as their world instantly turns into a helpless, waking nightmare of slander and violence. Almost totally friendless as they become engulfed by the evil that has found them, they face national hatred and vilification, prison, and personal ruin. ""Indictment"" has become a classic textbook study of the McMartins' ghastly descent into the dark side of American jurisprudence and media hysterics.

The cast is uniformly good, but James Woods is exceptional, creating a three dimensional character, a sleazy lawyer who first takes the case solely for the fame, but whose cycnicism is worn away by the witch hunt hysteria engulfing his clients. The movie correctly indicts the district attorney, the Manhattan Beach PD, and above all the KABC-TV and Wayne Satz. There is, however, one glaring omission: the people of Los Angeles County get away almost scot free in this retelling. Poor Nicollette Sheridan, as Woods girlfriend, serves as a stand in for the population at large. I lived in the South Bay, where Manhattan Beach is located, during this time period, and the reaction of the majority of the population to what were, from the beginning, outrageous accusations, was Salem-like. Cars sported bumper stickers saying ""I believe the children!"" and if you expressed doubt, you were vilified, even threatened with physcial violence. Even after impossible stories about secret airplane flights, ritual animal sacrifice in local churches, and the killing of a horse on school grounds, you would be told ""children don't lie!""

692151,5,6303597866,"""We've lost everything"" cries a Peggy Buckey, not long after exiting the courtroom following her bail. She and her family were thrown in jail, after the most unexpected series of events. Based on a true story, Indictment: The McMartin Trial was released as a TV movie in 1995, five years after the real trial had been complete.

In 1983, accusations were made that the McMartin family, who ran a pre-school in California, had sexually molested 360 children by the spring of 1984, as well as three other teachers from the same school. Arrests and the pre-trial investigation ran from 1984-87, whilst the trial ran from 1987-90. After six years of criminal trials, no convictions were obtained, and all charges were dropped. The trial remains one of the most expensive ($15 million) and long running trails in US legal history, showing the lack of evidence and unprofessional attitudes of the finger pointers which kept one of the accused in jail for over 5 years without bail. Indictment: The McMartin Trial tells the complete story of the trial and the people involved.

Made for TV in 1995, Indictment: The McMartin Trial came to my attention through the American actor James Woods. The script, written by Abby Mann and Myra Mann, gets right to the heart of the story throughout and is wonderfully written overall. The film's plot follows the true story very closely throughout, taking into account all the important details of the McMartin trial and what the family went through. What makes Indictment immediately captivating is the plot, which is as expected, the most important part of a film such as this.

The film's shock tactics revolve around the media and the pain they cause on the family, where the law fails to deliver true justice quickly and successfully when it should have straight away - all because of the media's involvement which led to the American public's bias opinion and a nationwide conspiracy of sexual predators. The film focuses on the story's key parts, taking the viewer from day one and all the way through to the final trial. Instead of the usual Hollywood cliches, the story is told the way it should be and thankfully, the film doesn't drag on with pointless scenes or distracting details. The film could have easily been this way over the running time of 135 minutes. What allows the film's plot to work so well is that each and every scene is crucial to the film, as well as following the true story closely. Each scene connects up together, slowing unravelling the story in the most effective way. The nature of the plot allows this movie to stay in the viewers mind for a good while after the film. Whilst those with an interest of the true story will already know how the ending is, the film's ending verdict was so strongly produced that as the viewer, it became a very tense moment, waiting for the verdict in the suspenseful scene.

Finding this film through James Woods, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that he wouldn't play his character in the most effective and realistic way. The entire film uses the right actors for the story, and not once does any actor seem out of place anywhere in the film. Expectedly, Woods steals the spotlight, playing Danny Davis, the defence attorney for the McMartin family. The other actors such as Mercedes Ruehl, Lolita Davidovich, Sada Thompson, Henry Thomas, Shirley Knight, Mark Blum and Alison Elliott all do a fantastic job in their roles. Various small characters also make up the effective story, and each role is played effectively and flawlessly. The British director Mick Jackson does an excellent job throughout, particularly for a TV movie. Jackson manages to capture the right tone of the film, the right lighting and the right camera angles throughout. His direction clearly managed to get the best of each actor's ability and combined it with effective camera work and strong visual drama.

I highly recommend this film to any fan of drama-related films or films based around justice and law. Whilst the true story is compelling enough, the entire movie is not once boring. Director Mick Jackson manages to capture the right amount of emotion throughout the film. Whilst James Woods remains the highlight of the film, every other character is portrayed wonderfully well and therefore makes the film immediately strong. As mentioned, the direction, editing and overall filmmaking is excellent and works in the most effective way. Whilst the story contains many messages, the film's effect on the viewer is very strong, and after watching, I found myself thinking about the entire McMartin trial. The emotion of the film is entirely powerful throughout and that's where the success of the film lies - showing the incredible strain that the family went through. This is done without the film becoming too bias, instead it is simply telling the story accurately and truly as it occurred. What makes the film most incredible is that from watching it, you can feel that the filmmakers and actors genuinely cared about the story and the innocence of the real McMartin family. Both emotive and shocking, Indictment: The McMartin Trial is a strong film with a meaningful message that is portrayed most effectively.",1362528000,6,5201,4.905681818181818

There comes a part in the course where I try to get the students to realize that we may laugh at the error-filled ways of thinking of our ancestors.  I use witch hunts as examples of ill conceived ideas that have horrible consequences for members of our society.  But then, I ask them to think if we are so different today?  Do our current cognitive/emotional equipment make us as fallible in our reasoning?  Then I show them the Indictment (with disclosure on the language and one image of a nude woman, so they can opt to do something else if that would make them more comfortable).  This movie is about the McMartin Trial that happened in the 1980's.  Several individuals at the McMartin school were accused of terrible sex crimes and child abuse, lives were ruined, the trial consumed 6 years of Los Angeles judicial time, it was the most expensive criminal trial in history, and resulted in zero convictions.  Why?  Because it was a modern day witch hunt.  Emotions ran high and people wanted justice before there was any evidence there was even crime.  In the end, there was not one substantiated claim.  Sure it is a movie, but as I tell my students, there is more truth in this movie than one would be comfortable knowing (and then we discuss the facts of the case).

This film portrays the Family as innocent people which is what I believe is true. There is no medical evidence that anyone was molested  at the preschool. A woman named Kee McFarlane was brought in to interview the children. Her interviews with the children were videotaped. The McMartin's lawyer viewed the tapes and noticed she used methods that might have possibly brought in false memories into the children's minds. The videos were shown in the courtroom during the trial when Kee McFarlane was on the stand. The McMartins ended up winning the case.

""The McMartin Case is also the subject of the cable movie, Indictment, produced by Home Box Office. Several children's advocacy groups have expressed concerns that the film's focus appears to be slanted in favor of the accused perpetrators. The newsletter for the organization, Believe the Children, contains an impassioned plea to its readers to relinquish their subscriptions to Home Box Office (HBO) in protest of the film's airing. An article featured in the newsletter entitled ""Sex Abuse, Lies and Videotape""(1995) describes the genesis of the program and voices its concerns that the true victims of the McMartin case, the children, might be damaged by the perspective of the  film's author, Abby Mann. According to the article, Mann and his wife, Myra, became advocates of the operators and staff of the McMartin preschool during the course of their trial. Because of the  Mann's involvement in the case and their relationship to the accused perpetrators, the article expressed the concern that the film might reflect an unbalanced portrait of accused and accusers  such that roles might be reversed in the eyes of the viewing public. This has, in fact, been proven to be a correct assumption. Reviews of the cable movie featured in magazines such as Time (Bellafante, 1995) and TV Guide (McDougal, 1995) on the film's depiction of an overzealous prosecuting attorney, a mentally unbalanced parent of a child victim, and a punitive therapist all lend themselves to the perpetuation of the ideas that the true victims are the alleged perpetrators. Ironically, this film also casts the media in an unfavorable light implying that the media's over-the-top reporting of the event led to a veritable witch hunt.""",1200096000,7,1863,5.1827242524916945
