1480823,5,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red was of course first a television mini-series that aired on about a few months ago on abc. It was the most scarriest movie(or t.v. show) I have ever seen! It's not just scary, there are really cool special effects in the movie! Now at last it is on dvd! I heard that there are going to be two disks on the dvd.
now the movie is really long that's probably why there are two disks in the dvd, but it's well worth watching! although you might want to see it with a friend! Im telling you this movie is ssooo cooool! it's about this high school teacher(Ms. Rearden) and it's the end of the school year and she planned on going to this haunted house that had alot of history! anyway, she called up some people that were telegraphic and phycic  and they said they would come because Ms. Rearden said the house was dormant. Well she knew the house would come back alive and kill people again because it feeds of of them! the rest is my secret and all  you have to do is find out! Im tell'in ya' see this movie!",1017273600,9,1012,4.158163265306122
1480824,2,B00005JL6X,"ROSE RED is one of Stephen King's worst attempts at a miniseries ever. The plot is all too predictable, and the acting mediocre. It seems King just wrote this miniseries to make more money. However, the film is not all bad. If you enjoy light horror, combined with some humour, and a few big names then you should buy ROSE RED.
  ROSE RED is set in Seattle where Dr. Joyce Reardon is a professor. She, and an expedition of psychics are about to embark on a weekend in Rose Red. Rose Red has a few surprises for its guests. Among its guests are Julian Sands, Matt Ross, and the late David Dukes. The acting is not at all impressive, and the plot seems as though King combined plots from his previous hits. This film is not one for the lover of movies of depth.",1016755200,3,759,4.263888888888889
1480825,2,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red (Craig Baxley, 2001)

Craig Baxley, who did such a wonderful job with the adaptation of Stephen King's Storm of the Century (and recently  completed an adaptation of one of my favorite woefully underappreciated books, Brooks Stanwood's chilling The Glow), took on another written-for-the-small-screen King  miniseries and came up with an opposite effect. In all the places where Storm was great, Rose Red stumbles.

The plot surrounds a haunted house in Seattle (can we all say The Winchester Mansion, folks?) and a professor of  child psychology, Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis, of So I Married an Axe Murderer fame), who believes that the key to getting hard evidence of the paranormal phenomena in  the house lies in a sixteen year old autistic girl named Annie (Kimberley Brown, of various Nickelodeon movies and A Bug's Life). She also invites Annie's sister Lauren  (Melanie Lynskey, most famous as Kate Winslet's foil in Heavenly Creatures) and a plethora of other psychics along for the Memorial Day Weekend ride.

The main problem witbh Rose Red is that, despite a cast that redefines ""high-powered"" where TV miniseries are  concerned, the whole thing is painfully overacted. Of the entire cast, only Julian Sands (as psychic Nick Hardaway) and Lynskey deliver performances that would seem out of  place on a daytime soap opera. Storm of the Century gave us a cast of then-relatively-unknowns who played their parts with chilling minimalism. The comparison is  painful.

Worth seeing if you're a King completist, but Storm of the Century or the video release of The Stand (six hours on  tape, eight on TV) is a much better way to spend a long King-soaked afternoon. ** 1/2",1015113600,6,1687,5.068840579710145
1480826,5,B00005JL6X,"I anxiously awaited the airing of the three-part series on ABC, and was not disappointed.  Steven Speilberg teamed up with Stephen King to develop a lush and spectacular movie.  I highly recommend that you read ""My Life at Rose Red: The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" before viewing the movie.  I, in fact, did the reverse, but it has enriched the movie experience nonetheless.  The fictional diary is listed as having been written by Dr. Joyce Reardon, PhD although it is actually Stephen King's work.  It is the prerequesite to events in the movie, and while you don't need to read the book to understand the movie, it helps to shed new light on the entire Rose Red experience...They've even created a fictional college giving more clues to the mysterious events that took place at the Rimbauer Residence...Stephen and Steven won't let you down!",1014940800,,841,4.853146853146853
1480827,5,B00005JL6X,"Stephen King is my favorite author.  So, it's only fitting that his movies be my favorite also.  A great cast was assembled for Rose Red.  Even though it's kind of slow in the beginning, it doesn't lack an interest.  The best part of the film was Julian Sands and his English accent.  His character was a gentleman, following Kathy, sacrificing himself for her and helping Annie break out of her shell.  If you haven't seen it, you must.",1014681600,,437,4.538461538461538
1480828,5,B00005JL6X,"This movie was awesome! Stephen King is an amazing writer! My favorite part was when Annie (Kimberly J. Brown) used her telekinetic powers to open all the doors and windows at the very end! This was an amazing film. If you see 1 movie this year, this has got to be it! I loved it! Kimberly J. Brown is my favorite actress in the world!",1014249600,,335,4.1692307692307695

I'm a horror movie fanatic and I can never find any good horror movies that are actually scary or even terrify me. This movie has it all and is truly better than most movies you see.

1481851,3,B00005JL6X,"I saw this movie recently on Halloween.  I couldn't help but notice that it has the same basic plot as an old Betty Davis movie from 1976 entitled Burnt Offerings.  That would be an old delapidated mansion that was evil and killed people to repair itself by drawing from their life force.  There was even the old hot house garden off of the kitchen that came alive as folks were killed.  One survivor was pulled into the house as a ghost to keep the house alive.  Rose Red differed in that it built to grow instead of only repairing itself and some folks were left alive; otherwise, it's the same story with different characters and details surrounding them.",1447200000,,658,4.5423728813559325

1482135,5,B00005JL6X,"First and foremost how is it not possible to love something that has Stephen King's name on it. I think that the movie has interesting characters that actually feel realistic and have problems as well. For example we get to see Rachel who tells everyone to call her sister because everybody does, she is of course the older sister to the autistic telekinetic Annie. We also have the momma's boy Emery who has to deal with his overbearing shopaholic mother who fusses over him, as well as the added on negative aspects of his paranormal power. Then there is Joyce who is a teacher at a college who is desperately trying to get some paranormal evidence out of Rose Red to finally put the neigh sayers to rest on paranormal research, and there are other intriguing characters as well. I would suggest this to people that like anything by Stephen King or haunted house movies.",1431734400,2,872,4.632258064516129

1482311,2,B00005JL6X,"When I received the dvds, they were in perfect condition.  However, the dvd case was really beaten up and broken at the top edge.  I love the story of Rose Red.",1427500800,,160,4.129032258064516
1482312,5,B00005JL6X,"The actual house, Rose Red, is fascinating. It's designed to collect and concentrate spiritual, psychic, and mental energies. Or put another way it can feed off the power of the mind and trap souls. When at a high enough power level it can turn energy into matter. Allowing it expand or transfigure itself, or to physically manifest the souls trapped within it.

This gives many examples of psychic abilities. The main group includes a Mind Reader, an Automatic Writer, a Touch Know, a Precognitive, and a Postcognitive.

Annie is most fascinating of the psychics. I loved the idea of an autistic possessing extraordinary psychic abilities. Her telekinetic abilities are off the chart, she makes Carrie look like nothing. She can also freeze water and revive dead plants. Her psychic abilities are as far above the others, as a super computer is above a pocket calculator. Thanks to her powers society had never tried force her to act normal, she remained in a serene state, completely in her own world.

Joyce brings all six to Rose Red, without revealing how much of risk they're taking. It's unclear if she actually chose to sacrifice them, or just ignored the likely hood of them getting killed and their spirits trapped. She also failed to realize that bringing the last descendant of the house's creator to the house would also give it vast amounts of power.

They spend most of movie trapped inside. Facing ghosts or solid manifestations. The house was deliberately kind to Annie, it wanted her safe and happy. Annie could have freed the others at any point, but being autistic she didn't understand the need. Each psychic tried to communicate with her, and finally the Automatic Writer succeeded.

I never tire of the climax. When the survivors escape, and Joyce refuses to leave. She stayed with her equipment, and then the ghosts came for her. She wanted to learned about Rose Red and got her wish - Eternally. Then Annie summoned massive stones from the sky. She basically called a meteor shower down on the house.",1425859200,,2025,4.857971014492754

1482645,2,B00005JL6X,"The only reason this dragged out, boring, badly acted, badly directed fiasco got a two from me is because Stephen King is in there somewhere.  (As a pizza delivery guy, he outacts the entire cast.)  The problems belong to the director, Sepideh Farsi. The acting here is wooden and seemingly directionless...even the decent actors in the cast are floating around with no idea what effect Farsi -- or worse yet, the audience --  wants from them. The only reason Farsi got the cast she did was because of King. Must have been hell on those sites, asking for direction, and getting nothing.  I can hear the dialogue and imagine what King intended, but Farsi seems unable to make that leap . As a result, she has destroyed what should have been a really great series. There are almost ten minutes of silence in the middle of one episode, and I can picture her thinking, Ah ha!  No dialogue. This part is all mine.  Now I get to use creepy camera angles and freak people out.  Ms. Farsi, if you want to direct a horror film, please do an Ed Wood on us and write and direct something yourself.  Leave Steve out of it.",1415318400,,1110,4.433497536945813

1482650,5,B00005JL6X,"In the special features on the two-disc version, Stephen King says this project was Spielberg's idea -- he asked Stephen King to write the best haunted house story ever -- and in my book -- he succeeded!!  I don't understand why this film isn't on the top ghost story lists because this house is absolutely incredible.  Of course incredibly well written, cast, and executed as Stephen King oversees all aspects of production, the loving attention to detail absolutely everywhere in this film shows.  What's more, I LOVED the length -- it made for a perfect weekend scare fest and the 5 hours flew!!  SO MUCH INGENIOUS stuff to love here -- for me, particularly, how the house changes -- drawing one deeper into it's malevolent heart no matter the actor's intended destination.  Particularly spectacular is the library of mirrors -- absolutely gorgeous set-making at it's peak.  Not only a great production, the film delivers in the haunted department as well -- special effects shine -- and the ensemble cast works like clockwork with some terrific comedy relief with the mama's boy character.  All around fantastic -- highly recommended!!

1482651,5,B00005JL6X,"*SPOILER* The story centers around a enormous haunted mansion in Seattle named Rose Red which is said to kill men and make women vanish forever, ultimately giving itself a ""Roach Motel"" reputation. Many check in, but few check out! A lot of people criticized this film due to the lack of explanation as to what exactly was behind the dark entities within the walls of Rose Red. It was the spirits of the ancient Indian burial ground that the house was built on. It was much like the same concept of the Poltergeist movie, the house became possessed by the dead souls who were buried under the establishment. Which was bad luck because it disturbed their resting place which deeply angered them. And just like the little girl who got sucked into the TV in the Poltergeist film, the people who vanished in Rose Red where consumed and taken to the other side and trapped there, eventually becoming part of the evilness.

The history of the people who lived in the house, and its most fondest owner was a woman named Ellen Rimbauer who's life was literally controlled by this mansion.

Our ""antagonist"", Ellen Rimbauer, is a very tragic villain. She was transformed from a submissive women who just wanted to be loved and blessed with a beautiful family and home, into a possessed Zombie stuck in a state of ""limbo"", while controlled by the evil spirits inhabiting her environment, confined in the alternative universe of the house forever. Ellen's story is indeed a romantic, sad and frightening supernatural tale about love, hate and the unfairness many women of her time experienced as victims of sexual repression and Victorian morality. Ellen was a soul who had been very hurt in life and her story is also about how we can take the negative feelings we felt during our time on earth beyond the grave, and then some.

To lose everyone you loved due to a ""houses"" jealousy, must have been horrendous. Ellen lived a life of heartbreak, disappointment and anger. Her husband, a very powerful business man who owned a vast and successful oil company, cheated on her constantly. Her young daughter, six year old April, who she loved more than anything, vanished in the house, never to be seen again. Other people close to Ellen vanished also, a few maids, one of them being a African Voodoo woman named Sukeena who was a very loyal friend to Ellen. And even a beautiful and spunky movie star disappeared in the house during a party in the 1940's, sealing Rose Red's reputation. Ellen spent her miserable life adding more rooms and elements to the house, creating a never-ending construction on the estate, hoping that if she never stopped building to make the house happy, the house would show mercy and release her daughter back to her. Rose Red grew envious of April and Ellen's relationship because the house wanted Ellen all to itself and anyone who was a threat to Rose Red was killed or eaten. When Ellen was eventually consumed by the house in 1950, it was ultimately abandoned yet was rumored that the house's architecture continued to grow all on its very own, but only on the inside so no one would notice.

Due to its long history of mysterious deaths and disappearances from the past, our story picks up when the house is finally investigated by parapsychologist Dr. Joyce Reardon and a team of truly gifted psychics. It is up to Joyce and her teammates to find out the deadly secrets of Rose Red and reveal the dark forces inhabiting it, or die trying.

The special effects were well done for a TV movie, the acting was pretty good and kept me glued to the screen. Very scary and very captivating.",1413849600,,3606,4.690363349131122
1482652,5,B00005JL6X,"This is the best mini-series by Stephen King, I wanted to get it on DVD; but the prices were outrageous. This is in 3 parts with the DVD; and in two parts with the VHS. It includes the making of, the cast interviews, effects, and set design after the movie. The VHS is good but the sound could have been better. I purchased on that was recorded in SP mode, so the sound at the beginning and very end SUX. I didn't know this until I opened it up; but other than that it's perfect. If you like Stephen King or any great horror mini-series/flick this is for you. It is the best mini-series so far from the master SK.

This man Stephen King is KING of horror. His movies and books are staged so unique and often requires a third take to understand.

I don't like his writings (Sorry to his fans really) I like other things. I like thrillers but I don't like to see things that make no sense in the end. I like to have my mind challenged and I like to be scared (a bit) but I like to understand in the end.  Example: skeleton Key. It all makes sense in the end.  Rose Red, I loved it as i watched it and then it ended and I was disappointed.  Am I missing something? May be but I don't see king's movies anymore.

When we were two hours in, he said ""To be continued tomorrow!"" and turned off the TV. I'll never forgive him! Okay, so maybe I would have been too restless to finish it one sitting, but I was well invested in the story and NOT ready to stop watching. If there is anything worth setting aside 4 hours for, it's this. Rose Red is a well-crafted psychological creeper that will suck you in, and an absolute bang-up job was done on the portrayal of the house (which is, arguably, the most important part). This may be sacrilegious to say, but I really can't stand Nancy Travis...however, the the rest of the cast/plot/effects in Rose Red completely nix her annoying factor.",1401840000,,810,4.3355263157894735

Like all of King's mini-series films on network television, you'll see little of the violence and gore that is present in so much of King's work.

Please do NOT confuse this film with the Diary of Ellen Rimbauer mini-series (which takes the same story further); this one is MUCH better in my opinion in just about every way possible.",1393632000,,540,4.723404255319149

When I first saw it as a child it scared the crap out of me and gave me nightmares (especially the part with the reporter and the rope hanging), but I loved it anyway and still do.  It is superb horror writing at its best in my opinion.  Stephen King did a magnificent job this time and instead of focusing on the blood, guts and gore (though there is that too) he decided to focus more on the characters.  One of the better ghost movies I've seen in a long time.  Sure it gets a little lengthy and you wonder when it will end but it is for the most part an at the edge of your seat kind of deal. I especially love the detail and history of the house and the parts where it suddenly changed.  All of the special effects are amazing and well done.  Even the skeletal versions of the ghosts popping up now and then throughout the movie with Emery are pretty good.  Anyway, all in all I give this miniseries a five star rating.",1389052800,,944,4.092391304347826

1483533,5,B00005JL6X,"ROSE RED

When this miniseries debuted back in 202 I believe I could not have been happier. Two of my favorite things were coming together, nay, three of my favorite things. Those things were Stephen King [as writer], haunted house [as the story and setting] and Julian Sands [as an actor] who I loved from the first two ""Warlock"" movies"". So naturally when it was airing I watched it every night and then when released on DVD I was right there to pick it up. So every once in a while when I come across it in the collection I have to watch it again. Being that it is October I thought why not right now, my lady loves it and I haven't seen it in a while so here we go.

The story follows a professor named Joyce Reardon who is obsessed with a local mansion that is said to be haunted, Rose Red. She wants to lead a research team into the house and try to prove what most already believe, that the house is alive and indeed haunted. It got its reputation by being the site of some 23 deaths or disappearances, and also much like when the lady of the house was alive and constantly building the house seems to continue her wish of expansion even after death. Dr. Reardon and her team of psychics enter the house expecting something but what they get is much more than what the bargained for.

Now I will admit that this is far from a perfect film and even being written by King himself it had to be toned down for TV. It was originally written as a feature film by king with Steven Spielberg on to produce; I guess he wanted to revisit something like ""Poltergeist"". But that didn't work out so years later here we were. I still wonder what that would have been like but any way what we did get was great. As far as TV miniseries go this is a fun one with a great cast. Nancy Travis was great as Joyce here would really wanted to prove ghosts are real so bad she is somewhat insane from the beginning. Matt Keeslar was good in the role of the houses sole survivor from the family, as was Melaine Lynskey as the character Annie's big sister. Speaking of Annie, Kimberly Brown was great in the role that was key to the story. In fact the entire cast was great but it was Matt Ross and Julian Sands that stole the show in my opinion. I have always liked Sands and knew he would be great in this but Ross was hands down my favorite here as Emery. From the first time I watched this film on TV even to now I always root for him even as his character is not the most likable to most people. But I felt like that character was the most realistic in the situation, as in that is the way I would be if I was there type of thing.

Set in Seattle Washington the locations look great and add to the atmosphere. When you thing of haunted houses it is easy to picture them in a place that is rainy, cloudy, and very moody. Also the set designs are wonderful from the present all the way back to the flashbacks. In fact it is those period scenes that shine the brightest here, especially with the performances of Julia Campbell as the owner of the house and Tsidii Le Loka as her best friend. Loka in particular is very creepy throughout the film, especially when she invites a young man from the college in [you will see]. Those eyes in that scene are brilliant.

Directed by Craig Baxley who also did other King mini-series's ""Storm of the Centaury"" [one of the all time best] and ""Kingdom Hospital"" along with this series' prequel film ""The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" this turned out to be a pretty fun film. It isn't the scariest thing out there but the characters and their interactions make this an entertaining watch. I do recommend this set to any King fan out there or any horror fan looking for something to pass the time on a weekend. I had fun with it all those years ago and still enjoy it now.",1382918400,,3788,4.219310344827586

1483653,5,B00005JL6X,"As part of my 2013 October Fright Film Fest, I've just watched a favorite TV miniseries, Stephen King's ROSE R$EDE (2002), with Nancy Travis, Matt Keeslar, Kimberly J. Brown, David Dukes, Matt Ross, Julian Sands and Kevin Tighe.

IMDb synopsis
""Dr. Joyce Reardon, a psychology professor, leads a team of psychics into the decrepit mansion known as Rose Red. Her efforts unleash the spirit of former owner Ellen Rimbauer and uncover the horrifying secrets of those who lived and died there.""

Each of these psychics has a special power: for one it's ESP, another touches things, goes into a trance and speaks as someone related to the object. Most remarkable of all is Annie Wheaton (Brown), a young teen with incredibly strong telekinesis ability. She can also make things appear or cause music to blare from open lilies. It's Annie that Dr. Reardon is counting on to awaken Red Rose from its current ""dead cell"" state, and it looks like this autistic child won't let her down.

Since 1950, this compound of uninhabited gothic-looking buildings has been slowly expanding on its own. Untended for a quarter-century, the grounds are overrun with a forest of plant life, roots and vines, some of it quite dead, which adds to an already creepy atmosphere that includes a pervasive ground mist.

Everywhere is a sense of a surrounding evil, forces that have in the past killed men and caused women to vanish forever. Visitors to Red Rose are being watched, but by who...or what?... and their safety is not guaranteed.

Running time, approx. 4 hrs. 10 mins. Rated 6.5 at IMDb.

PS-- Stephen King makes his usual cameo appearance in Part Two, as a pizza dude called to Red Rose.",1381449600,,1671,4.825174825174825

1483655,5,B00005JL6X,I have heard some people complain that this movie moves along much to slowly but I find the pace just right. I am one of those people who like back story though.,1380844800,,161,4.0625
1483656,3,B00005JL6X,"Every once in awhile you just gotta watch a scary movie.  It gets the heart pumping and the adrenaline rushing.  Which is good for you, keeps you alive.  Or at least in my opinion it does.  And Rose Red is 254 minutes of scary movie.  Well, sorta scary.

Dr. Joyce Reardon is obsessed with the paranormal.  Her greatest focus is on a local haunt in Seattle though, Rose Red.  A mansion that appears to keep on growing and is the source of many murders and disappearances.  Putting together a team of psychics and people with miraculous abilities, she sets out for Rose Red, hoping to find proof of a haunting and become vindicated in her field.  However, Rose Red has different ideas for what everybody there will do.

Characters:
Dr. Joyce Reardon: Nancy Travis
Steven Rimbauer: Matt Keeslar
Rachel Wheaton: Melanie Lynskey
Annie Wheaton: Kimberly Brown
Cathy Kramer: Judith Ivey
Emery Waterman: Matt Ross
Nick Hardaway: Julian Sands
Pam Asbury: Emily Deschanel
Victor Kandinsky: Kevin Tighe

I haven't watched this in awhile, so it was kind of surprising for me to see Emily Deschanel in this movie.  She doesn't have a huge part, but she does play an interesting character.  I think my favorite role in this movie was done by Sands as Nick Hardaway.  He was just such a nice guy as a character and a pleasure to watch.  I was rooting for him the whole time.  In contrast, the character of Emery Waterman was exceptionally annoying.  Which means that Ross did a good job, because he was supposed to be irritating.  All of the actors did pretty well actually, there just wasn't much they could do about a poorly written plot.

And it was poorly written.  Stephen King does a lot of things well, but this movie script was jumbled and all over the place.  And since it was long it needed to have a smooth timeline, which it just didn't.  Between the glimpses of the past, the random happenings to the characters, and the general mish-mash of things, it was hard to really settle into the movie.  Not to mention for a scary movie, it wasn't very scary.  It was a mix of the Haunting, the real life Winchester House, and a few other things, so you already knew what to expect.  But the likable characters carried it through so that overall it was an average experience.  I think if they had just slowed down a bit and developed the plot, this could have been a spectacularly scary film.

The cinematography was actually pretty well done.  They had great special effects and the ghosts, while not scary, were convincing and realistic looking.  They shifted between normal and rotting but yet looked the like the same person.  I also liked the setting of the house.  It was weird and spooky and had a bunch of interesting rooms.  The music wasn't very noticeable.  Mostly instrumental and in the background.  I can't say it really improved or ruined anything.  It was just sort of there.

It's not the best scary movie out there.  But it's good for a rainy day as background noise.  It certainly lasts long enough you don't have to keep changing discs!

Rose Red is no where near a horror or suspense type movie, it was a mini series created for Stephen King fans.

The characters come right out of Madame Tussaud's museum and rarely behave credibly. Chewing up the scenery is one expression for what the actors were probably urged to do. The virtue is that there are only a few moments in which one might have to stop noshing for fear of the impact of some gory. I can't say that anyone stands out for their performance, but there are three who are allowed to appear almost normal.

1483812,5,B00005JL6X,"I originally watched Rose Red on TV when it was aired back in 2002 and have to admit that it's my favorite Steven King Mini Series of all time, I think this was my third viewing tonight.  I have a love/hate relationship with Mr. Kings works--both on the screen and novels. The special effects were state of the art for their time and I imagine that many of the models and puppets used would be replaced by computer generated effects were the series to be remade today, but still hold up well and look quite convincing.  The story line is basically a combination of plots from other novels namely The Shining, The Haunting of Hill House, with a handful of historic fact from the Winchester Puzzle house.  Although Mr. King admitted having derived part of the story from the historical Winchester house in an interview in the special features, I was rather disappointed that he did not give any credit to Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House--because I think it's the strongest influence of all and is quoted more than once in the film.  Without revealing too much, I will only say that I liked the ending and found it more satisfying than some of his other stuff, most notably Storm of the Century--a story in which everyone gets screwed and there is very little light to come through.  I have to give him credit though for not portraying one of the psychics who was a Christian as being a crazy or bigoted person as such characters are often portrayed in stories.  The similarities with the Shining can't be ignored either, the Overlook Hotel and Rose Red have a lot of similarities in that they are so large that they are practically worlds unto themselves and that they each actually are anthropomorphized and characters unto themselves.  Again we have a gifted and misunderstood children with psychic abilities, and obsessed coconspirators with the edifices.  There is also the sealing off the characters from the outside world so that they have to rely on their own resources for the most part to survive.  I won't summarize the plot further as there is enough of that on the mini series page and I don't want to provide any spoilers.  I will say that if you like creepy, but not very gory stories, and are a fan of The Haunting of Hill House then you should enjoy this miniseries even if a lot of elements give you a sense of deja vu.",1371945600,,2343,4.583732057416268

The only thing I noticed is that the box doesn't say if its wide or full screen, and I couldn't get the image to look right adjusting the DVD player or the tv settings. Always either stretched wide or skinny, but it didn't bother the watcher I bought the movie for, so maybe it was a minute difference that I could see because this movie in VHS format is basically burned into my eyes for life.

It did make me wonder if this is a legit copy of the movie or a repackaged pirated version. I'm 95% sure it was the company's/my DVD players issue and not the seller.",1369094400,,738,4.160839160839161

1483880,4,B00005JL6X,"Most haunted house flicks are the chop 'em up, dice 'em up type. A dime a dozen - and literally, there are dozens of them. Rose Red isn't like that. Not at all. Maybe Rose Red borrows from the 1963 The Haunting, but only as much, in my opinion that the real star of the movie is the house. This is the coolest haunted house EVER! I like movies that take their time. I'm never in a hurry when I'm watching a movie and if you are maybe you should stick with Tales from the Crypt. Steven King stories are all fairly long-winded anyway. I never read the book so I can't compare the screenplay to it which, judging by the negative reviews was a good thing. I pretty much liked the characters - especially Annie, the autistic girl with tremendous psychic power. She appears to be the only one not actually in any danger from the house. The rest of the characters are a mixture of good and not so good, some more believably played than others. OK, confession time, I've always had a huge crush on Melanie Lynsky and I like everything she's in. For the money Rose Red is a great addition to any collection.",1367280000,2,1098,4.283653846153846

Stephen King should be ashamed of himself for ever releasing this piece of crap on the unsuspecting public. I've seen better tv ads for dog food than this piece of excrement. What a waste of time to even think about it a minute longer. Enough said, you've been warned. Thank you. :>)

Let me just say, like with most of Stephen Kings mini-series, you have to have patience to watch it, but it will definitely hook you.

1484325,5,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red.....what a ride!!.......this is one of Stephen king's best ""haunted house"" story.......along with ""THE SHINING"" of course!!. It is a 4 Hours adaptation from the TV series on ABC. I know that 4 hours may sound kinda long for a movie but when you start getting in to it, it's very hard to stop, you probably won't even notice that the first 2 hours already went by........

The story involves a psychology teacher, looking for people with gifts and abilities to bring them to ROSE RED, and old haunted house that was built in 1906 by wealthy oilman John Rimbauer, it was a gift for his wife Ellen. Numerous people went missing and strange event had happened over the years in the house. One day, Ellen disappeared too under strange circumstances, leaving the other occupants of the house with no other choice but to close it and leave.

The whole story surrounding the house, when it was built, and John and Ellen Rimbauer's background runs very deep in details and anecdotes and is extremely well presented. But it is when professor Reardon and her group of psychics finally get to the house that the party really starts!!!........

Rose Red is definitely in my top 10 of best horror movies of the 2000's, it perfectly captures the magic of those old 80's horror film. Its not one of those slasher film where all you can see is violence and people killing each other, this one has  a lot more to it!!! Magic....Fantasy and Fun!!!...yes, there is lots of funny moments in the movie as well

I would highly recommend this one to anyone who haven't seen it yet. Perfect on a rainy afternoon where you have nothing to do, just grab a beer and a bag of chips and your all set!!!!!

1484328,4,B00005JL6X,"Stephen King has always been an extremely derrivative writer, and much of his work arises from the influence of two novels by Shirley Jackson: THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE; he also also often draws an elemenent or two from the novel and film THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE.  Interestingly, for ROSE RED he not only draws from these usual sources, but from his own earlier works as well, most specifically CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, and THE SHINING.

According to King and other sources, the story for ROSE RED was suggested by the famous Winchester ""Mystery"" House built by Sarah Winchester, widow of gun manufacturer William Wirt Winchester.  Convinced that she was cursed by the deaths caused by her husbands product, she supposedly consulted a medium who told her that she must build a house for the spirits of those who had died by her husband's product--and that if she ever stopped building the house she herself would die.  She accordingly purchased a parcle of land in what is now San Jose, California, where she employed an army of workers who worked on the house for the next thirty-eight years.  Work ended when Mrs. Winchester died in 1922.

ROSE RED was originally conceived as a motion picture to be directed by Stephen Spielberg, but Speilberg eventually passed on the project, which then went to ABC television network as a three part mini-series directed by Craig R. Baxley, who had worked with King on the mini-series STORM OF THE CENTURY.  Final running time, without commercials was 254 minutes, and although some sources state it was originally presented in four parts, it was actually presented in three.  Critical reception was very mixed but the series was a rating smash.

The basic story concerns Dr. Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis), a professor specializing in parapsyhology who is so fascinated by an infamously haunted house named ""Rose Red"" that she essentially seduces the one living heir into an affair--and into giving her access to the house over a Memorial Day weekend.  Reardon, who is attacked for her beliefs in the supernatural by other faculty, takes a group of people with her to the house to make an investigation.  With the exception of heir Steven Rimbauer (Matt Kessler), they are all in some way psychic.  The most important of these is autistic teenager Annie (Kimberly J. Brown), who is accompanied by her sister Rachel (Melanie Lynskey) and who is generally thought have extraordinary psyhic abilities. Dr. Reardon hopes that Annie's abilities, as well as the various powers of the others, will awaken the house, which has long been dormant.  She succeeds beyond her wildest dreams.  The death toll in ROSE RED is extremely high, with only five of the major characters surviving the experience and seven dying or being consumed by the house in various unpleasant ways.

The film is a bit slow to start, for it requires considerable exposition: who Dr. Reardon and what her position is; who Annie is and what her past is; and a fairly detailed explanation of how the house came to be built and a sketch of its extremely unsavory past, which includes everything from apparently accidental decapitation to simple disappearance.  Once the party goes to the house, however, the pace picks up considerably--and so do the special effects, which are quite good.  Although the shocks and jolts aren't quite as frightening as you might wish, the whole thing is quite a lot of fun: the house seems to expand at will, and frequently leads people astray by suddenly installing a different room or a hallway where there was previously none.  There are mirrored floors, exploding windows, showers of stones, electrical disturbances, walking corpses, and all sorts of unpleasant apparitions until the survivors make the startling discovery that the house is feeding from Annie's abilities and that the least likely member of their party, Kathy Kramer (Judith Ivey), holds the key to communication with the child.

The cast is a mixed bag, with some a shade too over the top--but given the story line it really is hard to say what is too much and what isn't.  I was particularly impressed with Judith Ivey, who played in a low key manner until the script threw her into truly hellish situations, which she then played with considerable ""horror movie"" expertese.  The DVD consists of two disks, the second one with a number of fairly entertaining bonus materials (including a pseudo-documentary on Rose Red.  My one technical complaint is that the sound balance is not always what it should be: the background music has the habit of not staying in the background and thereby overpowering moments in the dialogue.  But all in all, this is a fun movie, certainly too disturbing for the under-twelve crowd, but every watchable for teenages and adults.  Recommended.

1484329,5,B00005JL6X,"""Rose Red"" is my favorite of King's mini-series. It's important to note that it is a mini-series, and therefore a several hour commitment. There's a genuine story here, with throwbacks to Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, CA. I love King's emphasis on the origins of the mansion and the differentiating physic abilities of those visiting the house hoping to ""wake up"" the spirits. This is a great movie for a rainy afternoon.",1306022400,,484,4.914634146341464
1484330,4,B00005JL6X,"""Rose Red"" is Stephen King's interpretation of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House."" That said, the house is far more malicious in ""Rose Red"" and the action is far less ambiguous. It is undoubtedly the house itself which is the agent of psychic disturbance rather than Jackson's Eleanor. There is a nice parallel between Annie and Eleanor. If you liked ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" you will probably like ""Rose Red.""

""Rose Red"" was a made-for-TV mini-series. Therefore, the movie is frequently split up and often restarts from an earlier event--much as you might expect because the new episode would recap what happened in the last episode. However, this does not necessarily detract from the film's cohesion.

Also, if you like ""Rose Red,"" try reading ""The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" also by Stephen King. The ""editor"" listed on the cover is the fictional character Joyce Reardon from ""Rose Red,"" but the book is written by Stephen King in the guise of Ellen Rimbauer herself. There is also a movie version of ""The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" but as I have not seen it, I cannot comment.",1305504000,,1095,4.850267379679145
1484331,5,B00005JL6X,"As someone who spent most of my childhood and early adult years in a very ""unfriendly"" house, and who's witnessed psi phenomenon in many people/places over the years, I found Rose Red to be quite disturbing because it's all too true. Everything, of course, has to be exaggerated for entertainment purposes; and thus things like weird statues coming alive and removing their faces, and boulders from the sky destroying houses, are surely not the norm. But mixed in with the fantastical is the real.

Since there's already so many reviews here, I'll point out just one thing: I was initially disappointed with how the Rose Red property was in such immediate juxtaposition with the ultra-modern, sleek buildings, highways and cars of Seattle. It looked contrived. Couldn't they have done the trick-filming in such a way as to put Rose Red just a bit farther away, toward the suburbs or rural parts? Then I realized that of course they could have if they'd wished to, and that Stephen King, as always, knew what he was doing.

The awkward juxtaposition was fully intentional: it tells the viewer that the paranormal does not occur far away and out there, in a dark, haunted forest; or long ago. It exists in, or side-by-side with, the ultra-modern, rational, hi-tech world of ours. No matter how much we would like to ignore or banish the psi world, it will not go away. The Rose Red property is Seattle's (and every other modern city's) shadow. It is always there, in the midst. Those driving by it, or living in close proximity, can try all they want to ignore it and pretend it's not there. But it's still right in our faces. There's a Rose Red in every modern city, sprawling out and metastasizing in our midst. It's our creepy, numinous Shadow that can never be fully banished in spite of our strongest denials thereof.

Finally, if anyone wants to go beyond the fictional and into the academic realm, a book came out in 2010 that can be of help: Authors of the Impossible by Jeffry J.

1484395,4,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red is not particularly scary, but it has some decent suspenseful scenes spread throughout its long running time (this was originally a 6 hour mini-series, so without commercials it runs just over 4 hours).  The acting is uniformly strong and of course the writing is great.  Looking back 9 years after it aired, some of the CG effects stick out, but thankfully most of the effects were done practically, so some of the creepy ghosts remain creepy.  The miniature work was very well done as well...you really can't tell what is a miniature and what was a real set.

Unfortunately the ""2 Disc Deluxe Edition"" is not packed with features.  You get 2 minutes of Storyboard-to-Finished Film comparisons (3 scenes), a collection of Still shots of the sets, and 2 documentaries.  The first documentary is ""The Making of Rose Red."" It runs 50 minutes long.  There is a lot of good information here (including a lot of information from Stephen King himself), but it is mainly one of those promotional fluff pieces (ie lots of people saying things like ""This actor is brilliant"" or ""The script was amazing"").  Some of the interviews were done prior to release (the actors talk about their roles, but try to avoid spoilers), but then they show some footage about how they did the ending, so it is a little confusing about who it was aimed at.  The second ""documentary"" is ""Unlocking Rose Red: The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" which was a fake ""real life look"" into one of the characters in the movie.  The 22 minute show originally aired prior to the Rose Red mini-series, intending to provide background information and hype up the mini-series.  It has ""experts"" who relay the history of Ellen Rimbauer and Rose Red.  One thing I did like was that they had people playing some of the roles from the mini-series, so it looked like ""These are the real people, and you'll see an actor play them in the mini-series."" It gave it a bit of believability.  It works as a promotional piece, but most of the details are seen/discussed in the mini-series itself, so you won't miss anything by skipping it.

I'd have liked a commentary track or two to be included on the set (if they couldn't get Stephen King to do one, then I'm sure some of the actors or the director could have been persuaded to do one).  Also, I wish they'd included some of the promotional trailers that aired leading up to the mini-series.

This is definitely not the best Stephen King mini-series, nor the greatest haunted house story, but it works as a interesting story and is worth your time in checking out.

1484399,4,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red (2002) was a made-for-TV haunted house movie based on Stephen King's novel.  It is 4 hours and 14 minutes long.  Basically it's about a team of psychics/paranormal investigators led by a psychology professor named Dr. Joyce Reardon (played by Nancy Travis) who go to a haunted mansion called Rose Red to conduct experiments to see if ghosts really do exist and to sort of ""awaken"" the mansion.  The team knows a lot about the history of the mansion beforehand, especially Joyce Reardon.  During the team's stay there, their presence and activities awaken spirits inside the house and the house's family secrets are uncovered.  The main character in this movie is a 15-year old girl named Annie Wheaton (played by Kimberly J. Brown), who is autistic and has powerful telepathic and telekinetic powers.  She uses these powers throughout the movie.

It takes about an hour and fifteen minutes for the team of investigators to arrive at the mansion.  This movie has a very creepy haunted mansion setting that was very well done and well built.  I really liked the atmosphere in this movie.  Even the outside of the mansion during daylight hours is creepy looking.  I don't think this mansion quite compares to Hill House in The Haunting (1963), but I rank it as the second best haunted house setting in movie history.  Speaking of The Haunting, I'm a little disappointed in Stephen King.  He said he wanted to make ""the ultimate haunted house movie.""  But there's a problem - he no doubt borrowed from The Haunting and also The Legend Of Hell House (1973).  He borrowed Shirley Jackson's (author of the novel The Haunting Of Hill House, which The Haunting is based on) idea of the house coming alive and destroying itself and the idea that some houses are ""born bad"", although this was mentioned in the movie and appropriately credited.  The book Hell House was written by Richard Matheson and both the book and the movie it was based on, The Legend Of Hell House, stole from The Haunting in some ways as well, but now Rose Red stole from both The Haunting and The Legend Of Hell House.  Rose Red also borrows from The Innocents (1961).  I think this is one of Stephen King's most unoriginal stories, so I'm a little disappointed in his approach.  It just shows how influential Shirley Jackson's novel and the 1963 movie have been over the years to authors and movie makers.

The best performances, in my opinion, were by Kimberly J. Brown and Nancy Travis.  Nancy Travis was perfectly cast as Dr. Joyce Reardon.  Kimberly J. Brown is outstanding in her role as Annie Wheaton.

While creepy, the movie is sometimes a little on the corny side (especially during the second half) with some at least semi-cheesy CGI ghosts and special effects, though they're not nearly as cheesy as the ghosts in the remake of The Haunting (1999).  Just because CGI technology is available doesn't mean it should be used in a movie like this.  Some of the ghosts that appear are kind of on the ridiculous side as far as how they look and act.  In movies like the original The Haunting (1963) and The Legend Of Hell House (1973) you don't see the ghosts and that is how it really should be, in my opinion.  It's what you can't see that is so frightening.  That's why the remake of The Haunting (1999) was considered terrible by so many people, including myself.  It was loaded with CGI effects and you actually see the ghosts (and they even talk).  This is only one of the reasons why that movie was so bad.  Rose Red, on the other hand, is a much stronger movie all around, so the CGI ghosts are much easier for me to accept.

Stephen King makes a cameo appearance as a pizza delivery man.  Overall, this movie is very solid, but I just can't help but notice the similarities to the three previously mentioned movies.  I definitely recommend this movie for anybody who likes haunted house movies.",1267228800,2,3882,4.660294117647059

I enjoyed it to the tune of four stars but the reason is that I am an easy mark for almost any haunted house story. King stated during the documentary that he wanted to make the ultimate haunted house film. In order to make this the definative haunted house movie Steven King recycled some old ideas and lines from Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE INNOCENTS and his own work in THE SHINING (and probably others that I am not aware of).

I am certain many fans recognized the plot elements and lines from THE HAUNTING including: The house is coming alive; Some houses are born bad (which was credited) and the basic idea of the plot which assumed that psychics would serve as a catalyst to the old house. I did enjoy this film and the only thing I was really upset with was the many very long lingering shots of the moody sets and CGI images of Rose Red which I think were only used to fill up the six hours of air time. Special effects were very good for a made for TV movie.",1243296000,,1067,4.25615763546798

1484447,4,B00005JL6X,"I'll admit straight-out, this is not the best or highest budget haunted house movie you could see.  But what it does have in spades is ambiance that give the abstract foreboding feeling that a haunted house should.  There's no direct sense of how exactly the house is evil, just that it perturbs, distorts, and manipulates it's inhabitants into insanity through visions and hallucinations.  That, and the house expands *itself* infinitely (easy to get lost in and no one knows the count of the rooms).  This is the cause of everyone's death through Rose Red (I'm sure you saw this one coming).

EG - One person sees statues moving and has a heart attack.  He would have survived if he could get into the house, but all the doors and windows are mysteriously locked.  The only person who sees him is convinced that he is a hallucination (due to the house OD'ing everyone on them), and refuses to submit to it.  Meanwhile, the woman who brought this psychic group there is too obsessed with the house (it is a pretty bad@$$ English Manor) to let a pesky thing like death get in the way of her studies of it, namely of the super-psychic kid who eventually tames the house.  Pretty cool overall.

- Cool house
- Cool story
- Detailed

Cons :
- Long (4+ hours)

""It"" and ""The Talisman"" (written with Peter Straub) were the last of his great novels.  Although I rarely read him anymore, I thought this miniseries looked interesting.  But it turned out to be a cross between Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" an the real story of the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California, where Sarah Winchester believed she would die if she stopped building her mansion.

I could not figure out if those long-toothed monsters were suppposed to be ghosts, vampires or zombies.

If you read it and you are an observant reader of his many works, you can tell immediatly that the style isn't his at all. His wife Tabitha wrote it. Read some of her writing and you'll see this. She was inspired by the Winchester Mansion in San Jose California, which becomes blatantly obvious once you've researched the mansion. Winchester Mansion was owned by Sarah Winchester, whose life is tragic in the early loss of her daughter (think April Rimbauer) and her husband- who was the man who invented the repeating gun mechanism which made Winchester gun company so famous, and wealthy. I forget what the mechanism was called, guns hold no interest for me, but it is easily googled. Sarah was told by a fortune teller that the spirits of those killed by the gun mechanism were angry and to appease them she would have to build a great mansion, and keep building it (sound familiar?)Construction was non stop for decades, the first time she gave them a day off she died. Every day she would come to the contractor with plans for something new, plans created in her nightly meetings with the spirits. No full floorplan exists for the house, and the room count changes daily. Odd staircases, sinks with 13 drainholes, doors into walls and windows in the floors are all found in the mansion.
The movie is excellent, although i have outgrown the horror genre. It is the house, not the plot, that I would recommend it for.

1484499,3,B00005JL6X,"With its new inexpensive price, horror fans can do worse than pick up ""Rose Red"" on DVD.  It's still the same thin and underwritten piece of melodrama that it was in 2002 when it debuted over three nights on ABC, but without all the commercials- and especially those very annoying ""Stephen King's Rose Red will return in a moment"" announcements that showed you all the upcoming scary scenes, thus minimizing their impact when you actually saw them in the show- the production actually gets some traction and is able to draw you in a little.

Make no mistake. ""Rose Red"" is still basically a bunch of sketchy characters working within the barest sketch of a plot, but Craig Baxley's solid direction makes the most of what's there, and more importantly, it does a good job selling the many scare effects.  So, if you think of ""Rose Red"" as a good haunted house ride at the amusement park (albeit a pretty long one) rather than a standard mini-series with, you know, a good plot, solid motivations, and well-drawn characters, you'll have a good enough time.

Disc 1 runs about 2 hours and 50 minutes and includes parts 1 and 2 of the original mini-series.  But pay attention if you just want to watch part 1 during your initial sitting. At about 1 hour and 24 minutes into the first disc, part 1 ends and the disc goes right into part 2, with only a slightly long fade to black and the sound of your DVD player keying up part 2 to alert you that you're moving into the second part of the series (the titles are only run at the beginning of part 1).  Disc 2 contains part 3 of the mini-series and runs the same 1 hour and 24 minutes or so as each of the first two parts.

Disc 3 also contains a 50-minute ""making of"" piece and a 20-some minute phony documentary (Rose Red: The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"") that purports to tell you the ""real"" history of the Rose Red mansion in preparation for ""ABC's mini-series dramatization of the actual events that took place there"".  It's a clever promo piece that's actually okay to watch before you view the mini-series; with its mock-real flavor and its extra tidbits of Rose Red ""history"", it even enhances the mini-series a little.

So, in the end I'd say that ""Rose Red"" was only a fair piece of entertainment when it originally aired, but without the commercials and with the interesting special features, ""Rose Red"" on DVD merits at least a ""good"" rating.

1484657,3,B00005JL6X,"First let's address the DVD set. The product ""Rose Red"" on DVD is an excellent example of what should be standard in most DVD releases. The product comes with:

1. Rose Red film (apporx: 4 hours and 20 mins)

2. ""The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" (A 30 min fake Documentary of

  Rose Red house)

3. The Making of Rose Red (50 min. behind the scenes show)

4. 3 StoryBoard/Scene comparisons (side by side comparsions of

  the actual scene with story

  board)

5. Some Artwork

Of all these extras, I felt only the last one was mediocre. The amount of extras (about 1 1/2 hours worth) is excellent (if you're into extras) and the fake documentary is believable and it's something someone could expect to see in the History Channel or something like this. The faux program even had differnt actors play the ""real"" characters in the movie. The only error I noticed was that the same actors (at least htier portraits) were used to depict Ellen Rembrauer and her African maid, which breaks the illusion.

However, the film itself was nothing special in it of itself. To clarify first, this is not much of a ""horror"" film. I watched the film twice, once with a friend and the second alone, but I really couldn't isolate a scene or sequence that I would say ""jumped me"" off my seat.

The film is more accurately described as a ""Ghost Story,"" more akin to fairy tale movies and other fiction of the fantastic. The difference is somewhat subtle, but I'd say what makes something ""horror"" is that there is a strong element of mystrey; that is, the reader/viewer/player ought to be somewhat clueless on what is exactly going on in the story (A good example would be Lovecraft's work).

In ""Rose Red"" there is never any doubt what is happening and what is occuring to the characters. There are two reasons for this: One is a specific plot element of the story and the other is the nature of the plot.

To address the former, the plot involves psychics (a group of them to be specific), I think this element of the story inhibits the mystery element in ""haunting"" stories, only because they can directly contact/influence the ghosts/entities. Further, some characters seemed to have such power (in the supernatural sense) that having them amongst the group precluded the possibility that everyone would die.

I am not saying psychics and good horror cannot mix ever (i.e. Poltergeist), but too much information is given in ""Rose Red;"" to such an extent that even obscure terminology is used from this supposed field of parapsychology (""Dead Cell"" etc.) durring conversation between the characters. For me, this made the story seem more hookie then anything else.

With respect to the nature of the plot, it is all very standard. ""Rose Red"" borrows and mixes heavily from estbalished 'Haunted House' lore. This in of itself is not bad, but because this is suppose to be a horror story, it makes the film less ""horrific"" or ""suspenseful"" if the viewer is able to guess at what is going to happen (and believe me, it's easy to anticipate the direction of the plot; my friend and I were making bets on who was going to die and when within the first hour; We were both only off on one or two people in the end, and I ultimitly won the bet -A Snickers Bar).

Another defecit for this film was the fact that the viewer is not actaully shown how the characters meet their demise. I'd say there is a balance between gore and mystrey in good horror, and if your not going to have any of the later, you damn well have alot of gore to invoke any sort of fear on the audience. Of course I imagine this is a result of the TV regulations more then anything else.

To summarize, ""Rose Red"" suffers from 'Too-Much-Information syndrome.' I thought, comparatively, that movies such as ""Mothman Prophecies"" was far ""scarier"" then this film, only because by the end of that film, the viewer is left to his own devices to really try to piece together what really happened in the duration of the story. Whereas in ""Rose Red,"" you are told what is happening within the opening acts of the show and its all quite standard. Not a bad set to purchase though, especially at the price most vendors are asking for it.",1146441600,4,4171,4.584118438761776

1484662,4,B00005JL6X,"In this mini-series Stephen King is not the original author and he remained faithful to the original book. And the result shows. The special effects, the general treatment and processing of all situations are perfect and very impressive, though not necessarily frightening. Stephen King tries hard to avoid gross elements and also tries hard to remain within the limits of decency. So we are not gripped in our tripe or gut and we remain intellectually active. The special effects then are an object of study and consideration, not a frightening element. The house itself is beautiful and the actors are quite good. The rhythm is slow, since it is a miniseries, hence video art and not cinema and that too gives time to develop a situation. The only real situational element is the conflict between the head of the  expedition  and the head of her department. The conflict leads to an interesting characterisation of university department heads as blockheads and narrow-minded, not to say blind, people. Stephen King also develops the characterization of the six psychics who take part in the expedition. There we have a lot of humor and it is even funny. And yet the house does not find a kingian dimension because the evil that lives in it is not identified in its deepest roots and hence in  its most frightening dimension : fear comes from within the viewer and not from outside. If the viewer cannot identify himself with one character or one situation he is not going to be frightened or it will only be superficial and in no way time-enduring. Decently we cannot identify with this enormous house because we are not a house and because we cannot ever dream to have or have had such a fancy house. We remain outsiders in the film. We may identify with the explorers, and yet even so they are shown as different, as abnormal in many ways and we cannot project our normal selves into them. It is a shame because the house was obviously built along many lines we can recognize here and there on models that come from many films, some of them horror films. But the magic of horror is not there.

1484663,5,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red is one heck of a Stephen King movie, infinitely better than his other movies like Christine, The Golden Years, The Tommyknockers, It, and his many others. Here, King has written a movie full of both suspense and offbeat humor as well as moments of sheer horror.

King seems to have a fascination for powerful young ladies as seen in Firestarter and Carrie, and here he continues that tradition with Annie, an autistic teenage girl with phenomenal telekinetic abilities. It is Annie who mostly steals the show.

Some reviewers claim that this miniseries is needlessly too long, but when you get into, time just seems to fly when there's no commercial interruptions to break the mood. I love Rose Red. This movie is a lot more gripping than Storm Of The Century or even Stephen King's, It. This miniserries has a flaw or two-- we see too little of the psychics before the house gets them, and Nancy Travis' performance at the end could've been a little bit more emotional when she realizes that she is not leaving that house-- ever, but those are minor little things that don't really mar an otherwise great mini-series.

1484724,2,B00005JL6X,"After watching Rose Red for a few minutes I wondered what in the world Stephen King was thinking when he created this mess.  It had potential and it has some amusing moments  but the overall final product was bad.  The best thing going for it is the character of  Emery played by  Matt Ross .Emery is funny, rude , fiercely intelligent and severely damaged by having a nutcase for a mother. He's also the only one of the group who reacts the way a normal person would. He freaks out and at one point is willing to do whatever it takes to get the heck out of this haunted house.  Judith Ivey as Cathy did a fairly good job with a part that could have turned into caricature.. Usually the Christian character is treated badly in the movies but Cathy is shown to be kind, brave woman who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. She's basically Eleanor from the Haunting but with guts, humor and a will to live.  Julian Sands as Nick, the British telepath is very good and is the real hero of the story. Too bad he doesn't get more screen time.

The rest of the cast is forgettable. Nancy Travis, playing Dr. Reardon who starts all the trouble by waking up the haunted house is not as bad as some the reviewers here claim. She's playing a card board character-- the mad scientist and there's not too much she can do with what she's been given. The actor playing the last living Rimbauer was boring and wimpy. I kept hoping that Rose Red would eat him. The autistic kid, Annie  was annoying.  Stephen King has been down that road before with and he did it much better in the past. If Annie is so important why does the house waste time on minor characters? Why not snap up the most powerful member of the ghost hunter team and be done with it? It's never explained.

As far as the scares go there are only two mildly good moments. The first is when Cathy peeps out the window and looks away. Unbeknownst to her a malevolent spirit is peeping back at her from outside. The second is when Emery's ghastly mother lies helpless on the kitchen floor and sees a smirking Ellen and Sukie studying her. (Stephen King must have been frightened by a fat woman when he was a kid becuase he's created a literary gallery of mad, bad and dangerous to know fat ladies and Emery's mother fits all three categories.)Other than these two brief scenes there's nothing remotely frightening about Rose Red.  The ghosts look silly and when dead Ellen flies towards the front door she looks like a papier-mch witch from an amusement park.  The rocks that hit Rose Red at the end look like sponges that  have been painted dark brown. Kids in a high school play could've done better than that and the ending is so bad that everyone involved should've hung their heads in shame.

Stephen King probably meant this to be a homage to Shirley Jackson and to the Legend of Hell House but it doesn't cut it. Rose Red isn't even a good rip off. If you are the kind of person who buys everything with Stephen King's name on in it you'll want the DVD. The rest of us can safely pass this smelly piece of crap by.",1126915200,2,3084,4.329861111111111
1484725,3,B00005JL6X,"When I give this movie three stars, I assume that the reader likes haunted house movies - there is nothing here to appeal to someone who is not a fan of the genre.  As a fan of the genre myself, I found the movie to be worth watching.  I wasn't thrilled, but I don't regret sitting through it.

The Good:

  This is a haunted house movie with a budget.  There are some very lavish and atmospheric sets and some special effects.  The effects may not be amazing, but they are at least believable.  Some thought has been put into developing some of the characters, which is rare for a horror movie.  I particularly liked the loser Emery, for whom we manage to feel sympathy even when he is being annoying or a bastard.  King also shows that he has an ear for the way that real people speak.

The Bad:

  Firstly, there is nothing very original about the story.  The idea of an abandoned house that keeps building and rearranging the rooms is new (where do the ghosts get the wood?).  The other elements seem recycled - most obviously, the tired theme of a team of researchers trying to find proof of the supernatural by spending the night in a haunted house before.  Oh, and has Steven King ever written a story that *doesn't* have a psychic child in it?  We have even seen the retarded psychic child at least twice before - Dreamcatcher and The Regulators.

  Most of the characters are two dimensional, which I suppose is forgivable in a horror film about eight people going to a haunted house.  Some of the characters, though, are just caricature.  I'm thinking in particular or Emery's overbearing mother and Joyce's stuffy academic rival - neither of whom would have been out of place in a zany teen comedy.  Even the characters in the backstory often don't ring true.  For instance, we are to believe that in the first decade of the 20th century, a rich white woman brings a black servant back from Africa and soon comes to look upon her as a sister - not exactly the kind of thing that the social mores of the day allowed for.  Perhaps we can give wealthy Ellen a pass on that one - she was going mad after all, so perhaps she was willing to entertain unusual ideas.  However, we are also expected to believe that, without the benefit of an education, this servant is both skeptical enough to see through a false medium and has the architectural skill to design corridors that play wild tricks with perspective.  I think that King is trying hard not to offend modern sensibilities here, even at the cost of making no sense.

  The greatest problem with Rose Red, though, is that the characters are blase about supernatural activity unless the plot calls for them not to be.  Most obviously, the entire plot hinges on the fact that Joyce is desperate to find evidence that psychic activity is real - we are assured that her whole career depends on her ability to turn up such evidence pronto.  So what is Joyce's first step in preparing her expedition to the haunted house?  She assembles a team of psychics, all of which can produce psychic effects on demand - including a little girl who levitates people, makes music play from flowers, and can destroy houses by summoning huge rocks from the sky.  Does Joyce haul any of these marvels into her department to save her job and establish her fame?  Nope.  The premise makes as much sense as a team of Bigfoots being sent out to find evidence of Bigfoot.

  Once there, the team soon starts seeing ghosts.  Given the fact that twenty-six people have died or disappeared in the house over the years (due to the ghosts, in Joyce's opinion), you would think that the group would be pretty freaked out by this.  And they are - for as long as they are sharing the screen with a special effect.  But almost always, they are relaxed again five minutes later.  They actually sleep in separate rooms, even when plagued by apparitions.  They even find excuses to wander off on their own.  Even after several people have died or vanished, one woman actually goes off on her own because she wants to get some tasty iced tea.  Once in the kitchen, she shines her flashlight out the window to reveal corpses looking back in at her.  And her reaction?  She continues on her way to the refrigerator to get that iced tea.  It must be really good iced tea.  I'm surprised the ghosts don't burst into tears and give up - or better yet, just wait around until the plot calls for the woman to have normal human reactions again.

  In short, the movie isn't smart or very scary, but it is worth seeing if you want to see a haunted house movie.

1484726,3,B00005JL6X,"Stephen King's Rose Red miniseries is unsettling but not very scary.  The special effects are mediocre, and the show itself is very long.  But the length of the show draws you into it, so you definitely do end up feeling uneasy, especially if you watch it at night.  Go ahead and make some snacks; you will need them, and there is no chance you will drop them out of your hand if something in the movie scares you.  I am very jumpy, but did not even twitch.  Usually, I forego snacks at scary movies, but you will need sustenance for this!

The story is about psychology professor Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis from Becker) who is losing her tenure and desperately clawing at a chance to find strong evidence of supernatural phenomena for fame and fortune.  Despite the threats and intimidation of Professor Miller (David Dukes), her department head, she gathers a team of psychics to go on an expedition to a great abandoned house known as Rose Red.

Rose Red was built there in Seattle in the early 1900's.  Wealthy entrepeneur Mr. Rimbauer built it for his young wife Ellen.  The marriage did not go well. Ellen became obsessed with the house, even though her young daughter April vanished there.  Many people disappeared in Rose Red, and the house was soon closed to even historical tours.

The film is worth watching only because of the creepy little powerful psychic autistic girl named Annie (Kimberly Brown), and because you want to see what happens to all the characters as they are trapped together in the house.  My favorite character by far was Emery (Matt Ross).  Emery is a fat, nerdy, but hilariously arrogant Mama's boy who runs around the house with his mouth open. I was falling off my chair laughing.

Taken with the wonderful book (and somewhat less wonderful movie) The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, Rose Red is a massive chunk of creepy entertainment that is somehow pleasingly more than the sum of its parts.

King again bumbles his way to the bottom in this blatant theft of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" -- a vastly superior novel by vastly superior author Shirley Jackson. However, where Jackson approaches the theme with creeping dread, King relies on cheesy special effects, cardboard characters, and their infinite supply of moronic under-reaction (case in point: a flaming apparition shoots from a fireplace amid electric explosions; yet seconds later, the miraculously composed characters are calmly smiling as a baby buggy slowly rolls toward them from nowhere. Huh? Who are these idiots?).

In retrospect, I'm really not sure why I decided to see it, since haunted house horror movies generally don't grab me.  But I did, and after a moment of shocked realization discovered that I was having fun watching it.

The story isn't anything spectacularly original. Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis), a parapsychology teacher,  bets her entire career on the possibility of finding measurable psychic phenomena at an eerie old mansion (Rose Red) in the heart of Seattle.  Said mansion has a long history of eating people, and Reardon's plan is to invite a selection of psychics to spend a weekend at the house in order to wake it from a dormant state.  Her ace in the hole is Annie Wheaton (Kimberly Brown), an autistic 15 year old who is an industrial strength tele-everything.

Sure enough, the house wakes up, fingers get lopped off, people drown, and a whole host of equally nasty things start to happen.  As the mysteries about the house begin to unravel, things get even worse and it becomes clear that Rose Red has no intention of letting anyone go.  From that point on it is a pure battle for survival.

The house is the real star of the film.  It is huge, full of weird rooms and interconnected hallways, and has a knack for rebuilding and changing itself.  CBS went all out to make it a spooky masterpiece, and they did a good job of it.  It's the kind of nightmare that you really would like to visit.  Think of it as a haunted theme park and you have the atmosphere.

Acting varies, but is generally decent.  I'm not sure about Nancy Travis though.  She makes Joyce on of those sublimely irritating characters that you start out sympathizing with and wind up hoping she gets his with an axe.  No such luck.  Julian Sands and Matt Ross are brilliant and everyone else has moments of greatness.

So I likes the show after all.  Since it's made for TV, don't expect a lot of gore or out and out violence.  The film starts a bit slowly, but the upside of that is that king spends as much time on character development as he does on plot twists.  While this isn't a masterpiece, it's worth watching on a lazy Saturday afternoon with buckets of popcorn.",1111363200,85,2388,4.53864168618267
1484815,5,B00005JL6X,"Well, Stephen King did an absolutely fantastic job writing this story for the production of this movie. Even though the movie is 4 hours long, the movie didn't bore me for one second. I really enjoyed this, especially Annie, the little autistic girl. I thought she was a very good touch to the story line. Also, to top it off, I found myself having a very hard time falling asleep after I watched this movie. It absolutely terrified me throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who's out for a good thrill.",1110499200,8,525,4.536842105263158
1484816,4,B00005JL6X,"This DVD contains a mini-serie of two episodes based on a script by Stephen King. It is long, 245 minutes (if I remember correct?), but this is by far one of the best King-screen-adaptions I have ever seen. Talented actors (delievering remembarable performances here), impressive camera-work, good effects, yes, a surprisingly well done production - and that for a TV-movie.

I have seen many (perhaps most) horrible thrillers based on Stephen Kings' books. Christine, It, Sleepwalkers and so on and on. B-movies based on great books though, but it is a shame that all these past productions reflects all the great work from this famous, talented actor. The most famous and critically acclaimed ""The Shining"" (Jack Nicholson) after all is more Stanley Kubricks' than it is Kings', only vaguely based on the book of the same name.

Rose Red was a surprise, and I would nearly call this a masterpiece. It doesn't give you the impression that the production-theme was in a hurry, more the oposite actually. It shows that the moviemakers with the actors were having a good time doing this, and doing their best that is.

The movie reminded me instantly of ""The Haunting"" (Neeson, Zeta-Jones) from the late 90's, but is far more talent than effects, and a thin script. The actors are better too, and I mean it! But these movies share a lot of similarities, so if you liked ""The Haunting"" you'll probably love this one. I know did.

Creepy? It's not ""The Ring"", but watching it on nightschift as I did yesterday it sure had some effect on me. And it doesn't seem as long as it actually is. The castle (if that is what ""Rose Red"" should be called is amazing, the place is a horror-movie itself, and far more spooky (not to mention BIG!) than the haunted building in ""The Haunting"" (another comparatition).

I'll watch it again tonight, I'm on nightschift again :)

The best King-horror-movie in years, perhaps the best ever, and the first to be worthy of his pen (if you know what I mean). And a great TV-production! Recommended if you liked Kings' version of ""The Shining"". Well done!",1104537600,6,2078,4.758333333333334

1484818,4,B00005JL6X,"This was a TV mini series that Steven King wrote and produced a while back. It was never shown on Oz TV so seeing it all in one go was better for me anyway.

The story is about an old house that has a curse that it is alive in a way. And the myth is that the previous occupents who lived there said that the house would tell them to continue to build it, or die.

The house has been vacant for many years, and it's legend is known to many around the area. And Nancy Travis has decided to go looking for paranormal activity in the house to find out if the legends are true or not?

She takes with her a team, one of a little girl with telekinesis that is very much like the Carrie charactor. Steven even included a scene that was in the Carrie book, but didn't make it into the movie because they couldn't make the effect look good, and that was falling stones that the little girl makes come about.

A few of Stevens other storys are dabbed in here and there to make a horror movie. I wouldnt say it scared me tho, not the least, some people it might scare, but I just found it interesting, never boring, and not predictable.

Some people don't like it because it goes for too long, it does go for a while, it's on 2 DVD's and about 4 hours long or so. But it's long because it was a mini series. And any time Steven's novels get turned into movies, they have to cut out so much to shorten the film. with this series he could do whatever he wanted without having to cut anything, so thats why it's so long.

The 2 featurettes are ok, one is the featurette about the cast and the making of. And the other is a fictional story about a previous owner of the house who talks about what was happening to her and the house and gives you more insight into the Rose Red house.

It's one of my favorite films. But I wouldnt say it's horror, suspence, or a thriller. I'm not sure what you would call it? Maybe a bit of everything. For blood and gore fans you will be disapointed in this film, it's kind of.. well, i'd say it's sort of a fammily movie on the paronormal/spooky/thriller/horror side.

1484819,5,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red is a pretty good and enjoyable movie with phenominal effects and beautiful house/setting.

Although set for present day Stephen King does a great job shifting the story line taking a glimps of the past thru out the movie to give pieces of historical information to lead up to the legends of 'Rose Red Mannor'.

Although fiction, if Im not mistaken pieces of the movie were based off actual legends and also the famouse Winchester house, which I belive has a specific name but I cant remember, but a house/mannor that the widow of the creator of the winchester rifle was told by a spiritualist/psychic to not stop building her house which made it a living legend and tourist attraction as of today...

Im not sure about the other so called legends that supposedly helped form ideas for the book/movie, but the movie was terrific and plain old fun even bringing elements of classic horror from way back to today. Well worth watching a few times over, and full of suspense, mystery, a living house that builds itself trapping/eating its victims as they explore inside, to vampiric ghosts to thepara psychology professor and her hired team of psychics and mystics to spend a memorial day week-end lock in investigation only to find slowly they are actually being used and being the hunted themselves.

Again, just plain old good horror fun with great story line and superb effects, and a huge creepy old beautiful mansion it takes place in.

If you buy the dvd make sure you see the specail features as it tells about the other real legends that have taken place to have inspired Stephen King to write the book for this movie. Very intresting actually and just as fun to watch this as well...

1484820,2,B00005JL6X,"I read ""The Diary of Ellen Rimbaugh"", the story of the woman who lived in Rose Red during the first part of the 20th. century.  I enjoyed the book, and actually thought the story was true, till I found out differently.  It was all very creepy, without being too scary.

If Stephen King's mini-series had concentrated on the book, it would have been so much better.  The mini-series was about Ellen's great grandson's girlfriend who gets together a party of physics, including a 15 year-old autistic girl, to spend a weekend at Rose Red. Part of Ellen's story is re-told, to set the background of the house, and actually that is the best part.  The rest of the movie is too drawn out, too boring and predictable.  Also, the setting is in Seattle, with Rose Red, in all it's decrepit condition-- and believe me, it's a mess-- sitting on a main thoroughfare.  Hard to believe the city would allow that !!  Of course, the great grandson, Steve, says he is going to sell it for demolition soon, but the setting is hard to believe.

There are so many silly scenes that made me want to yell ""Are you stupid?""  A photographer sent in by a professor to spy on the researchers, goes to, of all places to try to find his way out-  the greenhouse.  Or, as it's called ""The Health Room.""  After he sees there is nothing there but dead trees, he keeps walking in calling ""Is any one there?""  Yep, there was.  The killer bees.  The jerk should have gone back towards the front door.  Just one of many things that didn't help the movie. It's four hours long, and I would recommend watching the first hour, the last 15 minutes, and fast forwarding thru the rest.

1484949,5,B00005JL6X,"Well, I read my first Stephen King novel when I was 12 years old.  I read Salem's Lot and slept with the light on for weeks.  Since then I have read everything he wrote as Stephen and as Richard.  I watch all of the tidbits, articles, commentaries etc on him.  His imagination is amazing.  I only became disappointed when filmmakers began botching his books with very bad movie adaptions. There are very few Stephen King novels which have been able to transcend from his wonderful imagination in print to that same imagination re-enacted through the actor/ess.  Misery,Green Mile, Needful Things and Rose Red were a select few that made it.  Carrie, Firestarter, The Shining(despite a stellar performance from Jack Nicholson), Salem's Lot, The Stand, Dead Zone(again despite a stellar performance from Christopher Walken)and Storm of the Century did not. If you thought the movie was bad, look to your actors and directors, not to Stephen King.  There is no doubt that the book was good.  It is very hard to capture an imagination that spectacular on film, but occasionally it can be done.

ROSE RED could have been a really epic haunted house movie, but King borrows so much from previous novels and the producers dug up some really bland actors, therefore negating the potential right away.  So much of what goes on in ""Rose Red"" is muddled and pretentious.  Characters disappear and obviously die, but for some reason the script doesn't allow us to see that.  Even though made for TV, I think a little more actual scenes of the murders may have made it a little more interesting.  As far as the acting goes:  Nancy Travis (?) does not have the chops to carry such a schizophrenic role; she tries but a more seasoned actress could have made her more believable.  Overacting awards have to go to Laura Kenney (Emery's mother); Matt Ross (Emery himself); David Dukes (sad he died during the filming, but his performance was too comedic to be taken seriously).  Kimberly Brown as Annie, Matt Keesler as Steve, and Judith Ivey as Kathy did well; the others merely adequate.

1484952,3,B00005JL6X,"No one admires or idolizes Stephen King more than I do, but Stephen King's Rose Red falls quite short of becoming the ultimate haunted house movie.  There's really nothing frightening about it, for one thing.  For a six hour miniseries (which equates to just over four hours viewing time on DVD), the characterization is rather spotty, some of the casting is questionable, insufficient background information is provided, and all of the elements in this expanded story production fail to click.  There is nowhere near enough blood and gore for my liking, but of course one has to always remember that this was a made-for-TV miniseries and not an R rated theatrical motion picture - there is a nice finger-chopping scene, though.  The viewing experience on DVD is much better than the original miniseries experience, I might point out (although the video quality is surprisingly shaky).  It basically took the first night of the miniseries for things to really get going, and now one can plunge right into the heart of the story without delay; what little sustained creepiness is to be found inside the walls of Rose Red works much better without the handicap of commercial interruption.  This does lead to some soap opera moments, however, in those spaces that lead up to the original commercial breaks.  I think the real weakness of the film, though, is the ending, as it comes across as somewhat contrived; it certainly does not satisfy this viewer.
Initially, we spend some time meeting the central characters in this drama; I say ""meeting"" because I never felt as if I actually ""got to know"" more than two or three of them.  Nancy Travis plays Dr. Joyce Reardon, a scientist obsessed with proving the existence of the paranormal.  Despite the harassment she receives from her boss Professor Miller (David Dukes), she goes ahead with a scientific investigation of Seattle's supposedly haunted mansion Rose Red, intending to wake up what she perceives is a dormant cell and thereby gain the proof she seeks that spirits do exist.  She assembles a most unusual team of helpers, each of them psychic in one way or another (mind reading, post-cognition, automatic writing, etc.).  The key, though, is the teenaged Annie Wheaton (Kimberly J. Brown), an autistic youth with a proven track record of psychokinetic powers (e.g., pummeling a neighbor's house with large boulders out of the sky a la Carrie White).  The only really interesting characters besides Annie and Dr. Reardon are Steven Rimbauer, the last living descendant of the Rimbauers and sole owner of Rose Red (as well as Dr. Reardon's lover) and Emery Waterman (Matt Ross).  Emery sees dead people, is burdened with a mother who is exceedingly overprotective and a compulsive shopper, and whines and complains to beat the band.
Naturally, weird things begin to happen, we piece together more of the story of the house, and eventually individuals start wandering around alone basically begging to die.  Frayed nerves are snapped like rubber bands, and a few ghostly manifestations appear in zombie fashion from time to time to assist new victims of the house to their untimely deaths.  Needless to say, Reardon and her team are trapped inside the house.  A couple of other related characters find their way on the land to meet a most unkind fate, and eventually final resolution comes in a rather silly manner.
I'm just not sure that Nancy Travis was the right actress to play Dr. Reardon, but there are also problems with the character she plays. Fairly early on in the film, for instance, Reardon has a confrontation with Dr. Miller, and this scene as it played out had a negative impact on my enjoyment of the film as a whole.  David Dukes, the man who played Dr. Miller, died tragically during the filming, leaving behind a great performance of a despicable character.  I liked Annie, and I make a point to say this because King movies all too often feature young characters so incredibly annoying that you have to hate them.  King himself makes another great cameo appearance in the film, which is all the more remarkable considering the after effects of the relatively recent accident which almost killed him.
The only important bonus features on the DVD are two documentaries.  The Making of Rose Red is good and quite informative, but at fifty minutes it seems to drag on forever.  It is certainly worth watching, though, for the Stephen King interview clips if nothing else.  Then there is a half-hour feature on The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer; this is a promotional fake documentary ABC put out shortly before the airing of the miniseries itself.  It presents the story of the house and the investigation as fact, trying to create the idea in potential viewers' heads that the miniseries was to have strong elements of truth in it, which it does not.  If you have never seen Rose Red, I would actually recommend watching this feature before taking in the film itself, as it offers valuable (though still incomplete) information on the background of the house.",1067990400,36,5026,4.906729634002361

1484956,5,B00005JL6X,"Unlike some people, I love Stephen King's marathon movies. His personal adaption of 'The Shining' is one of my absolute favourites, and anyone who enjoyed that will certainly enjoy Rose Red.
In many ways, the stories are very similar. They both revolve around a house that exudes evil, and the people that are drawn in and trapped.
Rose Red begins with the focus on the character that will become the focal point of the film, autistic Annie Wheaton, who also happens to be a very powerful telepathic and telekinetic. We are given a display of her talents early on, much in the same way that Stephen King's The Shining introduces us early on to Danny Torrance's extraordinary gifts.
We then skip forward to present day, and are gradually introduced to Joyce Reardon, the college professor who is preparing to lead an expedition of psychics into the infamous mansion estate of Rose Red.
The building has an extremely checkered past, with men meeting gruesome deaths and women disappearing without a trace. As with the Overlook Hotel, Rose Red is a building that seems to have a life of its own, and readily consumes any who dare step inside.
This is most poignant with the character of Joyce Reardon, who was already dangerously obsessed with Rose Red, and who crosses over that thin line all too easily once she is inside the house.
Some have complained the movie is far too long, and at a whopping four hours, they may be right. But without the length of the film, King would not have been able to show Joyce Reardon's descent into obsession and madness as effectively.
One thing I noted, though, was Matt Ross as Emery Waterman. During my first viewing, I found myself severely irritated by his appearance, and the constant sneer on his pudgy face. It wasn't until my second viewing that it occurred to me that this actor would have made a perfect Harold Lauder in The Stand. I thought it a nice touch that not only did Emery survive the Rose Red ordeal (and escape his nightmare of a mother in the process), he became a much better and nicer person for the experience.
I finished my second viewing of the film hoping that Rachel Wheaton, Annie's older sister, ended up with Steve Rimbauer, with Annie in their permanent care. There was no such inference, of course, but we're allowed our little fantasies.
Rose Red, despite its many similarities to The Shining, is still a worthwhile movie - if you have the patience for it.",1065398400,,2426,4.68384074941452

Every bit of it is true from 1900 to present day and to think that that kind of stuff can happen in real life is just horrifing, spooky, and awsome all at once. Of course there are critics as always. They say the 20+ who were injured and killed there in the past 100 years is just a conincidence. And also things like rooms being impossible to count and compare to blue prints and previous counts since the rooms keep shifting or moving just being made up. But in my opinion thats paranormal activity without a doubt. Also - thank-you Steve (King) youve written another masterpiece just this time it was a movie/mini seires-script - Your awsome man!

This happens to be one of the really good ones. So many times when I am watching horror movies it is either one of two categories; ridiculously gory and violent, or campy and low budget; with neither of which ever having a good storyline. Rose Red was in neither of these categories. The cinematography is breath taking, and the script writing is very well done, with excellent casting for every character. I am actually always more interested in a story line that is creepy with accents of special affects, which Rose Red exceeds both those standards.
Yes, it is really long, and is a little unfortunate since I wish I had the time to watch it more often. It is also annoying that they left the introductions in some parts of the movie, where we are being updated from ""Last Weeks"" episode.

The plot is as follows: a college professor entranced by the supernatural collects a group of various people with unusual powers like telekinesis or the ability to see the future.  The professor tries to harnass their power in order to witness credible paranormal activity that will boost her reputation.  The house is Rose Red, an old mansion that takes victims in the most unusual ways and can even change its interior.  The group gets stuck in the house and try to fight and find their way to the outside world while others try to find their way in.  A chain of unusual occurences happens to the group as they try to keep their sanity.  The movie is full of flashbacks explaining the history to the house, as well as mediocre special effects that kind of hurt the movie.  It's still plenty scary, but you can easily find scarier.  Recommended to hardcore horror fans or anyone looking for some easy scares and can sacrifice the time it takes to do so.

1485140,4,B00005JL6X,"The problem with most horror films are the time constraints that are placed upon them. Being a television series that spans four hours, Red Rose effectively takes care of that problem, giving us sympathetic, and believable (to an extent) characters.
However, one must remember that given its a TV series, its special effects are at times less than spectacular, and that is one of its few detractors, a superficial argument that most critics would use in arguing against this film.
For me, I personally thoroughly enjoyed the film. Being broadcast direct to your television, director Baxley must have realized that the shocks which has plagued most of today's movies would be rendered ineffective, thus giving us a good old fashioned horror movie much in the vein of 1963's The Haunting, the book on which its based ironically is referenced (along with House on Haunted Hill) on the miniseries.
Although it does seem to drag along on several occasions, it is one heck of an unbelievably terrifying ride, and balances terror with humor excellently. I found it so enjoyable, that the first time I saw it was after I had bought the DVD, and sat watching the four hour long picture, engrossed and on the edge of my seat the entire time.
The plot is rather simple, and follows the traditional 'haunted-house' formula: a house with a bad reputation is wanted by an eccentric person, and tagging along for the ride is the house owner, and the guests, who in this case turn out to be psychics, each with their own special powers.
Without giving too much away, I'll just say that things go awry, as they always do. Definetly worth a watch for people tired of the jump-a-second movies being spewed en-masse in todays Cinema. Oh, and watch out for a cameo by King!",1044748800,,1752,4.766447368421052

That being said,, this particular movie is well in the line of King's stories... Did I enjoy watching It ? Not that much actually. I mean this is not the best of all Stephen King stories. I must admit I am not such a big fan of Bad-Houses-Movies, although I must also admit that horror movies can be entertaining too. I mean, they provide a different kind of chilly, a different emotional experience, and you know it's just happening on the screen not in real life, so these movies maybe provide a kind of excitement that one part of our brain may appreciate (unfortunately I guess). Of course, terrible things can happen in real life too, even real accidents can happen \ Anyway,,, this particular movie takes place in a huge mansion located in Seattle ,  and this house has a form of intellignece, a bad one in the movie of course. A set of participants want to commit hair rising  experiences in that house of nightmares... they won't be disappointed ; some will even be hurt or even die. Finally, this house of woes, considered as a living thing itself, is rocked by large meteorites. So much for the storey. Starting from there, the movie is not bad, it is just that it is too long and there are ""empty passages"" with little action in them. Some parts are very good though.

The only deviation I found was the story line reminded me of the Haunting (The HELL HOUSE) movie. However King's Movie surpases that simularity to make it his own.

1485143,1,B00005JL6X,"When I rented ""Rose Red,"" I thought that I would enjoy it, but I was wrong.  Instead of coming up with new ideas, King mainly borrowed ideas from previous stories.  For example, King used the falling stones, and the autistic girl's telekenisis from ""Carrie,"" crazy, fat Sonia Kaspbrak from ""It"" as Emory's mother, the people exploring the huge, gothic mansion from ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" and instead of having live cars or  trucks, it was, instead, a live house.  I enjoy the supernatural, but to a limit.  A live house that expands by itself?  Come on, now. I must admit, though, King has written many good books (i.e. Carrie, Firestarter, The Green Mile, Pet Sematary).  ""Rose Red"" started out well, but after the people  were in the house, I got the impression that King was being lazy with the story, and did not know what to write, so he added a lot of scenes which didn't make any sense.  For example, there is one scene where the man believes that ""the house is making a memory.""  When the death scene of John Rimbauer is told to Mary, King has to replay it in front of Mary instead of coming up with a better way to have it shown to her.
Overall, King has substituted a high quality legend about a charming old house for a movie with too many supernatural powers and a story that simply will not end.  If an hour or two was cut off, the movie may have had a better chance of being enjoyable.  ""Rose Red"" may have been something that Stephen King had a fixed deadline on, and without much time to do it, so the finished product was something that was low-quality and, for lack of better words, stupid.
As you could probably tell, I do not recommend this movie.",1041292800,5,1674,4.416938110749186

Nancy Travis was absolutely fantastic in her role of Joyce Reardon. Matt Keeslar was pretty good in his role of Steven Rimbaeur, only because his acting was a little dry.

Rose Red is a tale that could have easily made for Stephen Kings best novel since Needful Things, but instead he decided to write Rose Red as a screenplay (by request of Stephen Speliberg was orignally going to direct it), had Speliberg directed Rose Red we may have gotten the best horrow film in a decade, but that didn't happen. Instead we got another six hour mini-series, scaled back for a TV audience to a PG-13 rating. And this is where the downfall begins.
The special effects are excellent (high-budget quality), the acting is for the most part good, but the director made decisions for the last hour of the movie and the story really winds down way too quick without much resolve. Long story short (because although I only give it 3 stars I do recommend you see this one) this mini-series is good, possibly Stephen Kings best, up till the end, then it kind of falls apart for a quick resolution. I think another hour would have done it justice.
Now on to the DVD specifics. Rose Red is mastered in DD 5.1 (so it sounds great) and this alone will be incentive enough for some of you to pick up, but the bonus features aren't bad either.

They are going to reawaken Rose Red, a house that has ""eaten"" countless people and has been ""growing"" on its own for many years.  The group enters and the usual happens.
What made this movie better than many in my opinion is the fact that the characters are very well developed and they are killed off in a totaly unexpected order.  While there are better ""house"" movies out there (House on Huanted Hill, Amityville Horror) for a made for tv movie this one is good.

In the house, various scenes are just repetitive. Although I watched it at night, I was not scared at all! So much for all those creepy creatures that show up.
The para-psychologist also gets a little lost in her ""research"" in the house. In fact, her figure is just pathetic.

If you are a Stephen King fan, you'll enjoy this.  I prefer his books, to his movies, they just aren't as scary.

1485384,4,B00005JL6X,"It's a haunted house story, so you know, there's only so much that can be done. And it all is. I was quite surprised at this venture as King is famous for very slowly building up tension. Rose Red is one of the very few things he's done that opens with a bang, slows down a bit as we get to know the characters and the environ, and then just doesn't stop. As I live in Europe, I never saw the mini-series, but rented the double DVD which is some five and a half hours long. I watched the entire thing from beginning to end three times and just bought it. I think it is the best SK production to date. Not the best script or story, that stays with The Stand, but the best production. The story is, I think, a bit lame, but so what? It's a haunted house story, it's aim is to scare us, and it works quite well on that level. The DVD, at least the one available in Europe, is a good one, with a pseudo-documentary of the history of Rose Red as well as a documentary of the building of the sets, which are really fabulous. It's just great fun, well-acted (well, Julian Sands!) and very well produced, the house itself is great eye-candy, and, it even has a bit of a moral imperative.
No question, The Haunting of Hill House is THE haunted house movie, as I'm sure even Stephen King would agree. (And we can see the Hill House influences on Rose Red) But that doesn't mean that this one isn't very good as well.
(Oh yeah, why not five stars rather than four? Just because I think the actual story, which I will not divulge, is lame. But still, the film has everything else going for it, so I won't begrudge Mr. King yet another story with no foundation and no explanation.)",1027987200,3,1668,4.183229813664596
1485385,3,B00005JL6X,"As far as haunted house flicks go, Rose Red is certainly better than most of what Hollywood has had to offer recently (The Haunting remake, Thir13een Ghosts).  Still, even though penned by Stephen King, this thriller misses out on some of its own potential and the film is occasionally hampered by its TV limitations (mostly in terms of blood and gore).
The picture stars Matt Keeslar as Steven Rimbauer, the last descendant of the Rimbauer family, the builders and owners of the infamous Rose Red, a gigantic mansion purported to be haunted.  With his permission, an obsessed professor (Nancy Travis) rounds up a team of psychics to explore the mansion, and within they discover Rose Reds' secrets and terrors.
So, basically, the story is pretty much what we've come to expect from a haunted house flick.  Just get a bunch of people together, put them in a house, and knock 'em off one-by-one.  This one's a bit better than you might expect, thanks to the great production values and decent acting (considering some of the bad dialogue, I'd say the performances are often pretty impressive).  As a matter of fact, I'd say this film works in spite of King, whose script offers nothing new to the genre and relies on stupidity from the characters to keep the plot moving (at one point, the group actually leaves a tied-up woman behind despite knowing full well what the house is capable of).
Unsurprisingly, the film works best when it concentrates on quiet, creepy horror and the things that go bump in the night.  Thus, the second segment of this 254 minute (!) production is the strongest part of the film, offering much in the way of suspense and scares, but is unfortunately bookended by parts that either take too long to get moving (Part 1) or eventually succumb to silliness, which is exactly what occurs in the last fifteen minutes.
But this miniseries (at least from the second part on to the end) held my attention, and I was delighted to see that I actually could not predict who would die in what order, so I guess King deserves some credit for that.  This is all fairly well orchestrated by director Craig R. Baxley, who's beginning to replace Mick Garris as King's filmmaker of choice.",1027728000,9,2199,4.725848563968668

They were actually even SCARED at some points and they NEVER get SCARED! (notice the sarcasm).  Stephen King did a great job with this and i highly recommend!  They also even did a great job with keeping the suspense by making it an EXPERIENCE rather than just a movie.  About a month before this mini-series premiered, ABC showed a special about this supposedly haunted house and a woman who was going to explore it.  This program was actually promotional and used to get people really feeling like this house actually exists (which it doesn't).  They also made a ""diary"" of Ellen Rimbauer, the woman of the ""house"" at the time.  Great movie...go out and buy it.

A psychology professor named Joyce Reardon is endlessly intrigued by the myth of the house and gets together a team of psychics to come to the house for one weekend and wake it up.
I loved all the acting here. Nancy Travis plays Joyce very well. Some people have complained about her performance, but how would you rather have her played? Completely sane and level headed? The beauty of her character comes from its own words: When a person is confronted with something paranormal, then tend to protect their beliefs ferociously. All she wants is that proof. She got it on the first day, sure, but knowing her character, did you obviously think a person so set in her beliefs would leave before the end of the weekend. Joyce was dead set on proving Professor Miller and the other doubters wrong. She didn't just want proof. She wanted as much proof as she could get.
Kimberly Brown is excellent as Annie, who is my personal favorite character. Brown has played other roles, including a Disney Channel movie and some small roles, but I think that if I saw those, I wouldn't like them as much after seeing her in this. She is so radiant and talented in this role, and I hope she continues to edge into, if not more grown-up roles, at least roles in more grown up movies.
Julian Sands said in the documentary that he hoped that his character simply came off as a sexy, charismatic guy, and he is incredibly charming. You can't take your eyes off his when he's speaking. Even when he gestures, or is just standing there, he maintains that characteristic persona. No matter how bad you think the acting is, at least they all stayed in character throughout the movie.
This is an excellent miniseries, and I would love to see even more Stephen King after this.

Yes its long but very detailed and enthrawlling masterpiece. Stephen King captures this Haunted House tale of ""Rose Red."" If you love good old haunted houses and scary stories you'll love this. It has the sense of reality, maybe perhapes because some haunted houses are real or we would like to think so. Every house has a story, and this one is certainly has it's tale to tell.
It's about a mansion of a house thats been built by John Rimbauer who built it for his wife as a wedding gift. Some gift I have to say. His wife then gets the idea about ghosts, and her having to build the house until it's done. It's a spectacular house with mysteries to every room. And every room having a story to tell. But that's not where the story ends. Dr. Joyce Reardon played by a very great Nancy Travis, loves the story of Rose Red...who wouldn't? She embarkes on getting a group of psychics with their own specialties to awaken the house of Rose Red. The one with the key to open the house is an amazing teenage girl who's Autistic girl named Annie Wheaton who has a special gift. I think that's why I love most of Stephen King's stories he seems to use children as the key to the unseen world. Such as in Stephen King's IT. Not to mention he's a fantastic story teller bringing together a remarkable cast and crew together to tell this haunted tale of which originally aired on ABC. It has a wonderful haunted tale, amazing characters that you'll love and love to hate.
The DVD is a great buy! I was really impressed with it. It has a fantasic The Making of Rose Red. Which is very detailed and I think longer than a half an hour. It goes through the special effects, and how Stephen King got his idea to tell the tale, which is in fact based on the Winchester House in San Jose, California. It also goes through make up, and the cast tells their story of the making of the film. It's Stephen King's first I think since his accident. At least his television story mini series. And not to worry, Stephen King makes an appearance in his movie of course. The making of it is great I loved it. If you like the behind the scene's stuff that goes into the movie. It also pays tribute to David Dukes who sadly passed away in the movie. It also goes into detail of the book, The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, with Dr. Joyce Reardon. But they leave that part up to you whether to believe or not any way it's fun and detailed of the story before the team enters Rose Red. It also has production commentary which I have yet to view and other languages to select. I give the movie and DVD an A+!!!

I have read every novel and collection that he has released and enjoyed many of his adaptations but this story lacked one thing. ORIGINALITY!  All Stephen King has done is update the The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson for the special effects crowd and that had already been done by Liam Neeson and gang a couple of years ago.  The main characters in both Robert Wise's 1963 adaptation and Stephen King's current spook house story are not really likeable.  The only character of a heroic nature in Rose Red is the character played by Julian Sands and he does not live to see the end. His character was the most enjoyable and interesting.  The Amityville Horror was much better than this claptrap. I did like the Winchester House angle and perhaps if they told that house's story, the movie would have been much better.  I would also have presented more demonic forces and perhaps possession.  In addition, the beginning of the film was overdrawn and we do not really get to see the house until nearly 90 minutes into the movie. This might have made a good 4 hour miniseries but 6 hours was a little tedious.  For better chills, rent 1945's ""The Uninvited"",  1963's ""The Haunting"" by Robert Wise, Richard Matheson's ""The Legend Of Hell House"" with Roddy McDowall, ""The Amityville Horror,  or even Stephen King's (not Kubrick's) ""The Shining"".

Why on Earth was Joyce Reardon so psychotically OBSESSED with Rose Red? It's never explained...nor is it explained how she came to know all these people that she would pay for their appearances at the house.
Apparently the good doctor needed proof that the house was alive and kickin'. When she got her proof, she wanted more. Why, I don't know. I guess she wanted to unlock more secrets of the place, and folks dying kind of took a back seat to that hunger. But WHY? Why was she so obsessed?
We'll never know, I suppose. Her acting was miserable. The acting of David Dukes (rest his soul) was miserable. Julian Sands was the best thing that happened to this movie that apparently strove to hire as many over-actors as possible.

We are enticed by this and as each character becomes a real person to us we just HAVE to find out what happens to each one. The death of actor David Dukes was unfortunate and left us wondering what happened to his character, Prof. Miller. I guess we will have to read the book to find out. Casting was very good, the scenery and effects were fabulous.

1485524,4,B00005JL6X,"Rose Red, a spectacular miniseries written by horror-master Stephen King and directed by Craig Baxley (Storm of the Century), was shown on ABC in late January 2002. Many reviewers in the media were not exactly excited about this film. I did not see it when it first aired, though I deeply wished to. Eventually, I bought the DVD; I was ready to watch it. I enjoyed it throughly.
I think Nancy Travis' role as Joyce Reardon was a little overdone, however. (Maybe Ms. Travis should just stick to Comedy.) I was hypnotized by Kimberly J. Brown's performance as Annie Wheaton, a autistic telepath. I also could not help but love Julian Sands' portrayal as the incredibly witty, incredibly psychic Nick Hardaway. The score is haunting and beautiful, and it makes me wish there was a CD available that had that on it (10 points go to Gary Chang!).
As for the movie, I think that the beginning characterization is something that was necessary, and it was a nice switch from the usuaul gore fest you in Horrors today. Bravo, Stephen. The special effects are superb. Flying stones, building houses, close-ups that get your heart going, ghosts that make you afraid of what may be sleeping on the other side of your bed. Not to mention the stunning animatronics made for the role of Ellen Rimbauer. Some people have found it chillingly scary, but I didn't find it all that frightening (And I'm only 13!).
Now for the plot. The basic story is much like Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE. (Or was it Hell House?) ""Some Houses Are Born Bad"". You betcha. This house, which was built in the late 1800s/early 1900s, builds on to itself (To understand more about the history of Rose Red, I highly suggest the page-turner THE DIARY OF ELLEN RIMBAUER: MY LIFE AT ROSE RED). So, crazy Joyce Reardon, obsessed with Rose Red, leads a team of psychics into Rose Red to wake up the supposed ""dead cell"". Soon, the house's dead spirits, who were never really gone, start to reek havoc and people start disappearing. Everything leads up to dark secrets revealed and a climatic ending that is predictable.
The reason why I say FOUR STARS, and not five, is that by the time you arrive to Disk Two of the DVD, after the ""statue incident"" (You'll know what I mean when you get there), you begin wondering when this movie will end. Though every single part is necessary in my view, I believe it does get slightly long-winded. The Special Effects are quite amazing, however.
As for the Special Features of the DVD, there isn't a whole lot. There's original storyboard designs, a 50 minute long documentary on the making of ROSE RED, a fake documentary on Ellen's diary (I think that was supremely creative), artwork, a trailer and Commentary. It does give a in-depth look at everything, but it didn't get me exicted or anything.
All in all, I believe it is a great movie to watch when you have an open four hours (insert snicker here). Kudos to King and Baxley for a job well done.",1021766400,45,2959,4.6273764258555135

It doesn't hit on all the right spots that you'd want. This is an original story by Stephen King written specifically for the little screen. I believe this happened only one other time with ""Storm Of The Century"". With King writing, you would of expected something a bit better. Here we go. Nancy Travis stars as Dr. Joyce Reardon, a professor who was once respected but is now sort of regarded as a joke since she has gone into the paranormal. Sort of like Agent Scully on ""The X Files"" in a way. She plans on going on an expedition to the Rimbauer house in Seattle. A big, scary, victorian like mansion that is supposedly haunted. She brings along a team of people, each with their own power, to the house. But, the one thing she needs is a telekinetic little girl named Annie(played by Kimberly J. Brown)who she believes is the one with the power to awaken the ghosts within. As the movie goes along, it's clear that Joyce has other intentions. I have to say the movie looks good and is filmed sharply. The flashback scenes showing the origin of the house and it's owners was nicely done. Most of the characters are very good and well thought out. The performances from the cast are very good, but with a few exceptions. Kimberly Brown as Annie just does the quiet, odd little girl routine. It is a strictly 'by the numbers' performance. Nancy Travis seems to be very wrongly cast in role of Joyce Reardon. She just doesn't ring true. Matt Ross is the best of the bunch really making his character the best. And then there is David Dukes. He plays his professor character with the most arrogant, pompus scene stealing bravado he could muster. He does it very well. One of the better cast members. Sadly, he passed away halfway thru filming from a heart attack. A stand in came in and doubled for him for the remainder of his scenes. You can really tell it's the stand in too. The thing that really ruins this movie is the fact that it's a 3 part mini-series. There is so much padding in the movie that is dampers the whole thing. We are talking four hours or so without commercials. The good stuff that is really good and effective is long forgotten in between scenes that it doesn't hold any lasting effect. The movie would of benefited better if it were a shorter, normal movie. The effects are adequate, but the flying ghost at the end was laughably bad. The make-up is okay, but nothing over the top incredible. It is a very entertaining movie, don't get me wrong, but it is stretched so thin that it nearly vanishes before your very eyes. We expected something stronger and more long lasting from King. ""Rose Red"" isn't his best venture into T.V., that honor goes to his re-working of ""The Shining"" a few years ago, but it is a decent effort. It had the potential and talent behind it to of been so much better. The cast includes some familiar faces like Kevin Tighe(""K-9"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""), Julian Sands(""Warlock"", ""Arachnophobia""), Matt Kesslar(""Scream 3""), and Judith Ivey(""Designing Women""). And, of course, the humorous cameo from King himself. The movie wasn't rosey or red enough. Maybe next time.",1021507200,5,3279,4.578231292517007

1485529,4,B00005JL6X,"I sat up for three hours in the ""AWE"" position last night. Sitting on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, jaw draging the carpet, mesmerized by this story. There were new up-and-coming actors new to my eye and some seen previously in very different roles to this. All were excellent. It seemed everytime you think you know what will happen next, something very different happens. Though some of the FX were true to made for tv movies, it was really done well. Then there was the ever popular cameo of Stephen King with his comedic expressions that made me take a break from the chilling moments to laugh for a brief second only to know that something IS going to happen soon to return me to the edge of the couch. Great movie and I'm sure I'll be letting everyone I know that there's one more ""must see"" scare flick out there.

1485631,5,B00005JL6X,"I saw Rose Red on tv when it aired this past winter. Stephen King usually has unique, scary plots so I tuned in to see how Rose Red would be.  All I can say is that I was scared to turn the lights off for about a week afterward. Just imagine staying in a mansion with a reputation for the people who have died in it.  Added to that, there are people who have gone in but have never come out. The house is alive and feeds on the fears of those who dare to enter its doors. When a professor trying to establish herself in a university, collects several people with special powers in order to research this evil home, she does not realize the magnitude of its power. One by one the group gets smaller as each comes face to face with the evil that dwells within the walls of this massive house. With Stephen King's uncanny ability to allow us to identify with the strangest of characters, you will detest the jealous colleague,hate the whiney momma's boy, feel for the big sister of Annie, and feel drawn to Annie the little girl who can make Rose Red come alive.  This is a must see. Rent it , buy it but don't miss it.  It is wonderful. Definately a DVD worthy of my video library.  I also recommend IT, The Stand, and The Green Mile.",1021161600,2,1232,4.181434599156118
1485632,4,B00005JL6X,"I don't normally go for the S. King sort of movie/lit, but this film is worth the time!  The plot keeps you wondering about the mysterious house and its former owners, the interaction of the actors is terrific (Julian Sands is beautiful as usual), and the scenery/effects are visual eye candy - scenes in the mirror library are worth your time alone.  BUT - (you knew this was coming) the ending stinks....  it was like the writer(s) got tired, or ran out of time/money, from making this terrific film and just threw the ending together.  The ending is corney and does not flow with the level of complexity of the rest of the film.  We passed this tape around work and all the coworkers agreeded about the ending - 2 die-hard King fans included.
Synopsis: Wholeheartedly recommended up to the last 15 minutes.",1021161600,,809,4.629370629370629
1485633,1,B00005JL6X,"Rumor has it that Stephen King is planning to retire.  After watching this nonsensical waste of many hours, it's easy to see why.  The only good thing that can be said about it is that it is opulent in sets and cinematography, and has some pretty good special effects.
As for the rest...
That the plot is hackneyed is a matter of small consequence  -  a team of psychic researchers spend some time in a famously haunted house, seeking answers to the paranormal  -  but the story not only doesn't do anything original, it actually does everything that has come before in the haunted house genre worse.  The running joke of the show is that the parapsychologist leading the expedition to Rose Red wants to nail ironclad proof of the supernatural to stun the scientific community  -  yet one of the psychics she has with her makes objects fly around rooms at will, the haunted house changes its architecture before her very eyes (and the eyes of a half dozen witnesses and a loaded camera), and the house supposedly builds entire wings onto itself when no one is looking (which should make proof of the supernatural no harder than demonstrating that no work crews have been there since the house was finished).
Worse than these logical absurdities, however, are the characters, not a single one of whom acts like an adult even when over-the-top pyrotechnics aren't occurring.  They squabble like junior high school students, plotting petty juvenile revenge against each other and continually playing baiting games that are beneath even fourteen-year-olds.  A major plot point (it takes up most of the last installment) concerns the house being able to hold its visitors prisoner solely because one psychic little girl remains conscious  -  the characters actually debate killing her, when simply waiting for her to fall asleep or, at worst, temporarily rendering her unconscious would suffice.  And what makes that even worse is that the little girl is about the only really likeable character of the lot.  The transitions of the characters are not believable  -  they simply act like children, pretty well throughout.
What makes all this more amazing is that the man who attached his name to this embarrassingly awful piece is the same man who wrote The Shining, one of the best haunted house stories available.  Read that, instead.  And watch The Legend of Hell House, or the incredible 1963 MGM version of The Haunting, if you want to see this kind of thing done-up right.",1021161600,10,2472,4.8708133971291865

It is amazing. I am sadly, almost done with the book. I may reread parts of it again, cause I loved it so much!! I carry the book with me everywhere I go. I loved the house, it is amazing. I would love to go the Thornewood castle and the Winchester mansion.  I loved Kimberely Brown, and Julian Sands. I hope this movie, comes out on vhs pretty soon!!",1019347200,,673,4.299212598425197
