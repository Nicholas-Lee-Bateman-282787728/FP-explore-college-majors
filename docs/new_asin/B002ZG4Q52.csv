4018295,4,B002ZG4Q52,"Being a bonafide Quo fan I'd say this is the rockingest concert I've ever seen. It's
Rock with a Capital ""R"". This concert does not slow down, & it has old & new Quo music, loved the setlist. Don't hesitate just buy it now.",1258070400,9,223,4.090909090909091
8384783,5,B002ZG4Q52,This Blu-ray is a fantastic showcase for a band that for many years thrilled audiences in England and Western Europe for decades. The material is a very valid representation of their hey day in the late sixties that nearly lasted into tbe 80's. Blazing dual guitars and a strong rhythm section make this show a real tour de force. You will find yourself raising the volume instinctively to really get in the feel of the intensity of this performance. Rock on!,1490313600,,459,4.679012345679013
8384784,5,B002ZG4Q52,"Status Quo. What can you say? They evolve and adapt with the times. You can't really say any vintage was a golden age as they're all solid gold. This is a truly superb gig, marred only by the fact that, at this point, they've too much good material to fit into a single set. Not impressed with the extras, but what extras can you put into a concert DVD anyway? I'm not going to deduct stars for not doing the impossible.

The sets are basic and movement around the stage is limited. Quo has always been like that. They're highly skilled musicians, they can play blazingly fast, their voices have held up better than they have for many rock/boogie groups, but if you're looking for Queen-style theatrics or Iron Maiden's operatic drama, you won't find it here. Quo are under-rated, under-watched and under-appreciated in their domain. If that domain appeals, you can't go wrong with this. It's ok to like other music as well, diversity is good.

If you've never heard Quo before, but are willing to give it a go, start with a concert. This would be a good one.",1483488000,,1059,4.539267015706806

8384791,5,B002ZG4Q52,"Having recently rekindled my listening pleasure with this band thought I would give this DVD a try. Extremely glad that I did. To begin if your are in any degree a Status Quo fan you should purchase this right away. If you just like high octane rock n' roll you should also buy this. Status Quo puts on an excellent performance highlighting many of their best hits. They play tight and professional throughout the entire performance. I don't have a high end home theater system but I found both the audio and the camera work to be top notch. I watched portions of this DVD almost everyday for a month. Whereas I used to like this group on a more casual basis; they are now among my favorites. The extras are basic, interviews with the two lead members Rossi and Parfitt - they are informative and enjoyable. But its really the concert, right! Enjoy!",1346025600,,849,4.51948051948052
8384792,4,B002ZG4Q52,"Pictures Live At Montreux features the English band Status Quo in a tour de force performance at the world famous Montreux Jazz Festival, recorded in 2009.  Befitting the event, the production of this is DVD is first class, as the band plays over twenty of their songs, in a show that runs about 100 minutes.  Camera coverage of the large stage is good, and image quality is excellent, although at times the pace of the editing is a bit too brisk.

Going by different names prior, the band Status Quo was ""officially"" christened sometime in 1967.  Their sound underwent a makeover in the early 1970's, becoming kind of a blend of blues, boogie, and good old fashioned foot stompin' rock and roll.  With a mostly pure guitar sound, much like ACDC, Status Quo accomplishes a lot with a few basic cords, as the band excels in establishing a heavy groove and playing the hell out of it.  Forging on through the years, these veteran rockers are now probably in a class by themselves.  For over forty years, guitarists Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt, have kept Status Quo viable, through the seas of changing musical tides, as their solid working class rock and roll still retains its appeal.

Rossi and Parfitt, who are both over 60 at the time of this performance, might be pacing themselves a bit, but these guys definitely still rock very hard, and don't seem to have lost any enthusiasm for performing.  Rounding out the lineup are versatile Andy Brown on keyboards, guitar, and harmonica, and bass player John ""Rhino"" Edwards, who have both been in the band for nearly two decades, and relative newcomer Matt Letley on drums.

Status Quo is very solid on stage, playing without flash or pretense.  Looking quite dapper, Rossi sticks with his well worn vintage green Fender Telecaster, throughout the entire show.  Parfitt changes guitars a few times early, but also favors a vintage tele that looks like it has served him well for decades.  It's clear that it is the sound, not appearances that matter to these guys.  The guitarists share the vocal chores with Parfitt being more of a boisterous shouter, while Rossi is more laid back.

The setlist spans the band's career, including their first hit the psychedelic ""Pictures Of Matchstick Men"" performed in medley with bouncy ""Ice In The Sun"".  The bands crunches along like a freight train on their most heavy numbers like ""Rain"", ""Down, Down"", ""Caroline"", ""Roll Over Lay Down"", ""Is There A Better Way"", ""Mean Girl/Softer Ride"", and ""Drive My Car"".  The band also covers ""The Wanderer"", Chuck Berry's ""Bye Bye Johnny"" and ""Rock `n' Roll Music"", and John Fogerty's ""Rockin' All Over The World"".  About midway through, after pounding the audience with the ""Proposing Melody"", the tempo slows a bit, and the introspective ""In The Army Now"" is a really interesting change of pace for the band, as is the snakey blues of ""In My Chair"".  Parfitt and the boys sound downright mellow on ""Living On An Island"", before cranking things back up for a powerful finish.

Capturing a really solid performance from this hard rocking bunch on what is clearly a good night, this DVD is highly recommended to their fans.  There is a nice insert with color photos, and some thoughts about about the history of the band.  Bonus features includes interview segments with Parfitt and Rossi, who a year later in 2010, would each be awarded the OBE (Order of the British Empire) in their native land, for their contributions to music and also humanitarian causes.",1331337600,4,3490,4.820469798657718
