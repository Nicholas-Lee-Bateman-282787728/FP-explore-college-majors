4839243,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight in Paris is the most entaining film I 've seen. It has wit, great story like Cinderella when the clock strikes 12 midnight things really begin to happen.
Great views of Paris, great acting, great story and music ala Django Rheinhart, and most of all Woody Allen is a genius.

I recommend this film for everyone to see. You get your money's worth and then some and leave with a smile.

4839244,5,B005MYEQ4U,"In my opinion this is Woody Allen's best movie which rivals RADIO DAYS. While in Radio Days we have a compashionate nostalgic return to the culture of the 40's, in Paris we have a comic study of the whole phenomenon of nostalgia that we all suffer from, this time mainly to the 20's and its famous literary characters. This movie is a delight for anybody older than 65.",1306540800,11,369,4.4411764705882355

It may be his most charming film.  Sure, it doesn't have the depth of ""Hannah""or even ""Purple Rose,"" but it sets out to do something and succeeds wonderfully.  It's his best movie since ""Bullets Over Broadway.""",1306540800,12,437,4.304878048780488

4839253,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Generally not a Woody Allan fan, based on some  of the reviews, plus the inviting title, I plunged in.

The good/bad conflict is between the members of a rich Republican business family, and a successful Hollywood script writer in love with
their pretty daughter, all of whom landed in Paris on a business trip.  The writer, Gil, is taking an hiatus from script writing to write a novel
about people who love memorabilia.  Gil manages to be open, pretty generally loving and accepting of the family  into which he intends to marry, being open minded and outspoken about their differences, accepting their criticism fairly affably.  He's the kind of hero who invites pity and the hope he will have courage enough to follow his own intuition, instead only of reason.

Some friends  of Inez, the daughter, show up. She is delighted to go places with them; Gil is disinterested and declines, thus taking a first important step.  He wanders, gets lost, sits down near a church, the bells of which chime at midnight.  Immediately, a  1920's  driveled sedan
pulls up, the guys pile out and insist Gil come with them.  From this moment on, I was in heaven with few deviations.

I have realized something akin to Gil's cognition:  that famous people and their friends never think they are making history while they are doing it; they just live their passion, living their  life fully engaged.  Gil's realization was that people who believe a Golden Age is a different one than which they are living are hungry for something missing for them, maybe a culture which appreciates beauty, or safety, or caring over
war and hatred.  In every epoch, there are miracles and mangled messes, triumphs and maybe terrible losses.  My belief is that in each time period, there are social, caring and creative people who are working to solve the current problems and make things better; there are also those who are working  to dominate, exclude and control others, generally making things challenging, even worse, even dangerous.  So, at
least one can choose somewhat on what and with  whom to spend time, attention and energy.

What was exhilarating was the number of interesting (and now famous) characters who wove in and out of Paris in that decade: Hemingway,
the F.Scott Fitzgeralds, Picasso, Dega, Toulouse Lautrec, T.S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, and more.  Each night Gil went for a walk at midnight, he was whisked away in the limousine, and ended up chatting and drinking with new acquaintances, all to be famous.  The actor's face was
amazing to watch as it told so much of what confusion and delight he was experiencing.  I loved seeing a young Salvador Dali, and Hemingway.  The casting seemed outstanding!!

You can imagine the relations with his proposed in laws and fianc becoming strained; the disagreements more sharp.  Then he has that
defining awakening that people who long for a different age will end up preferring and longing for an even earlier time that will fulfill them, when they must seek what they love within their present lifetime.",1522540800,,3039,4.880859375

4839264,4,B005MYEQ4U,"RELEASED IN 2011 and written & directed by Woody Allen, Midnight in Paris chronicles events when an American writer (Owen Wison), his hot fiance (Rachel McAdams) and her parents visit Paris. Incredibly, the nostalgic writer finds himself going back to the 1920s each midnight and meeting iconic artist/writers. Michael Sheen plays a pedantic academic.

Allens movies are the perfect antidote to conventional CGI-laden blockbuster drivel. Midnight in Paris is magical because (1.) Paris is such a charming city, which is thoroughly showcased, including the picturesque prologue, and (2.) the plot involves a fantasy element. Concerning the latter, there were 2 or 3 scenes where I didn't buy what was going on, but it was only for a moment and the movie quickly recovered (remember: movies are supposed to take you away to another place/time/situation and make you believe it through cinematic wizardry). In any case, the morals of the story are commendable and effectively driven home.

Woody has a good eye for women without resorting to sleaze and quasi-porn. And the charismatic McAdams is showcased in all her jaw-dropping glory; modest La Seydoux too, to a lesser degree. The ravishing Marion Cotillard is also on hand in a significant role, but her beauty is diminished by the 1920s look/apparel shes straddled with, but thats not really a problem.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 34 minutes and was shot in Paris. ADDITIONAL CAST: Tom Hiddleston, Alison Pill, Corey Stoll, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo, Adrien Brody, David Lowe, Olivier Rabourdin and Kathy Bates.

4839270,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I've been to Paris three times and devoured Hemingway's A Moveable Feast nearly as often.  Even today the city itself is truly like stepping back in time; all one needs to do is get rid of the new cars, just like they did in this movie, and you can step into any age you desire.  The characters are overplayed a bit, but the color and the atmospheres depicted match the memories of Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Stein.  The only problem I sense is that Allen couldn't decide whether to be serious or comic and as a result that's how it comes across: a bit confusing.  As a counterpoint, I'd suggest watching The Sun Also Rises.  That movie achieved what this one doesn't, but that's not to disparage the effort.  This movie is highly entertaining.",1515369600,,743,4.548872180451128
4839271,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Better than the typical Woody Allen fare, which, let's be honest, is probably because it's set in Paris. Some of the performances are pretty blah, particularly several supporting actors whos portrayal of literary heavyweights are particularly jarring. Kind of like watching a high school play only these guys got paid millions just to show up. Also, generic of Allen films, beautiful female characters (of limited intelligence) are merely used to highlight the angst genius of the male protagonist, a protagonist that becomes increasingly more irritating and unsympathetic as the film mostly focuses on his new goal of (SPOILER) getting laid by the next beautiful girl. Not sure how you could write this script and not come off with the feeling that the mopey protagonist and his materialist fianc in some ways aren't just made for each other... Guess I expected more witty banter, insight and pathos from the literary/artist characters, but just another laissez-faire Allen film with the obligatory (SPOILER) new romance with a character that barely seems to be above the age limit, much less within a decade or two of the protagonist. Big ew... But hey, Paris is lovely and some of the other supporting actors were awesome, so it distracted from the waste of the main story that really had hardly anything to do with the plot of meeting some of the greatest artists of history. slow clap, slow clap",1515196800,,1400,5.012875536480687

4839298,1,B005MYEQ4U,"Although this is a theme which attracts me--stepping back in time, Paris in the 20s, a slice of La Belle poque, I found this film incredibly tedious. The dialog was very Woody Allen, which was fresh and orginal in the first decades of Allen films, but is mind-numbingly repetitious in his present films. As much as I have liked Owen Wilson in Wes Anderson films and in other places, the dialog of the film doesn't quite suit him here. The wonder-struck boy aspect comes through well, but not the driving passion of the artist that would make us respect or root for him. Allen generally supplied that well in his first few decades in these sort of roles. John Cusack did it well in Allen's ""Bullets Over Broadway"" also. But here, as good as Wilson has been with comic works, the character and dialog do not fit. The film looks like it's been shot through a honey gause, which sadly gets in the way of the beauty of Paris. The 1920s characters were not written very well. I did not find them believable, although there was at least an effort to meet the stereotypes we now have of them but without introducing the passion of their work. Kathy Bates stood out as a very good Gertrude Stein, but because Allen didn't choose to or couldn't imitate her critiquing style, there wasn't much meat there.",1512518400,,1294,4.534188034188034
4839299,2,B005MYEQ4U,"I hate to sound like an old crank, but other than beautiful scenes of Paris and typical doodly old school Woody Allen music, this movie was rather pointless.  Filthy rich people go to Paris, a younger couple who are engaged and the young woman's parents.  The young man, Owen Wilson, does the most skin-crawling,  oily Woody Allen imitation (obviously standing in for the old fa*rt) imaginable.  He's a wanna-be novelist.  He is enchanted with the city, his girlfriends is indifferent, and they are obviously mismatched from the beginning.  He goes walking at midnight. In Paris.  And an old fashioned car of partiers picks him up and takes him to a party where he meets....his IDOLS.  All those famous intellectual types from the past who lived there at the time.  Hey, it's Hemmingway!  Hey, it's Salvadore Dali!  Lookit, it's Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein!  Could that be Luis Buneul and Man Ray?  OMG, it's F.Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda!  And later he goes back to his fiancee at the posh hotel, 'working' on his novel, but every night going back to wait for the vintage car to pick him up and take him more places. He meets women, one in the past, one in the present, who he likes more than his fiancee....Yes. So?  Pointless.  It's been done, sort of, in the past.  Nothing of much interest happens.

4839308,5,B005MYEQ4U,"A romantic comedy that doesn't ever take itself too seriously, delivers a very unique message, and whose claim to fame isn't solely based on needing a film degree to understand it, is a refreshing addition to the genre and movies on a grand scale. While it does, at points, feel as though the film is spoon feeding you the message (which it quite literally does towards the end, spelling the moral right out), that's pretty much the whole point of the narrative. Our main character is spoon fed glimpses of his supposed ""golden age"", delivered to interactions with his heroes and inspirations, and handed all the tools and experiences that he's going to need to succeed in changing his story and his life for the better. So, who cares if the moral is dropped into our laps, all tied up with ribbon in a bow? That delivery is part of the mood and pacing of the story; Paris wants you to find everything that you need to make your own path, and trusts you to learn through the game that is the journey, rather than with a bunch of unnecessarily blown up drama and contrived emotional outbursts. It's not an exhausting movie to watch by any means, and it's been quite a while since a film has left me so energized and refreshed. Unlike so many other critically acclaimed works that drag characters through the mud and put nothing but horrible barriers in their paths to overcome in order to learn their lessons, this film really embraces the feelings that a trip to a magical city brings and doesn't even hint at wanting to remove us from that feeling.

The most annoying aspect of the movie is Woody Allen's heavy hand in interjecting his own distinct voice in all the proceedings.

This is art about art....and culture and man's search for meaning and fulfillment. And oh yes, love. To be yourself and follow your dreams or to be a phony and sell out to wealth and security. The perennial dichotomy becomes very personal and intimate here and I often found myself lost and emotionally engaging with the characters. I am still thinking about them a day later. And feeling them too. Funny, it's as if I now KNOW them and they are a part of my life. Woody sure has an eye for talent and casting. This cast is absolutely stellar.

Such a great actor! Love them all though! Oh and Tom Hiddleston or as I name him Tom Hiddle""HUNK""ston, ha ha I know all the ladies love him. Who could blame us!!! Owen Wilson your performance was so sweet, I love the role you played because it shows how artists use their imaginations and how challenging it can be for others to accept it especially as a couple.

Astringent impressions of the writers and artists makes this no simple love fest for the past.  Dali's monomania on the rhinoceros judges him as a side-show among the great artists, a monomaniac rather than a visionary. Every scene has a subtle one-liner (""No wonder she tried to lead"") and, of course, there is the Republican, the epitome of reaction, here at last given a clever line, as Gil goes off to another adventure in the time zone, ""Say hello to Trotsky.""

Gil, the character, could not help himself from giving the writers their greatest hits.  So he tells Hemingway the origin of all American literature, He give Louis Bunuel the idea for The Exterminating Angel, but, Bunuel inexplicably becomes as literal-minded as his fiance, wondering ""what kept  them in the room?,"" while the surrealists, when we first met them, were miles ahead of the prosaic.

4839389,3,B005MYEQ4U,"I enjoyed the premise of the movie without really enjoying the characters, is that wrong of me?  Allen did well at presenting caricatures of the literary heroes of the protagonist, effectively presenting a ""real"" montage of what are essentially daydreams, ala Young Indiana Jones, but in a more cartoonish yet serious way.  From Hemingway's deadpan delivery of realism to Dali's over the top surrealism, I thought the only poor characterization was Picasso, which might have been fun, but the chance to have Picasso go head to head with Gil over Adriana was missed. I give it three stars because Allen's writing always makes me tense, and this was no exception, which gives rise to my title: Owen Wilson's ability to project diarrhea of the mouth is at it's frustrating best here, and is the perfect voice for Allen's writing style.",1503360000,,832,4.935714285714286

Owen Wilson stars, and by gum he is well cast, along with a troupe of actors -admirably suitable and brilliantly portrayed in character to the illustrious famous.

I love this film set in Paris...a favourite of mine because one of my best friends was a French lady Christiane Vouloir ( -had she still been with us now ) she would have adored this film? The lady herself had lived most of her life in Paris; her father George introduced Christiane to cafe society in 1946 at the tender age of 6 years....her father particularly asked her to remember Jean Cocteau: I think this is why I am so endeared to this film the French way of life that conjured magic and freedom?

Midnight in Paris is a film very much full of fun and nostalgia  Owen Wilsons character is enchanted to the magic that will follow him....the present to the past is very surreal: The film itself is beautiful; present in portrayal of pictures, paintings - and thoughts  and writing, of course...the passion of life and love ...hope you enjoy the film it is a merry carousel in the funfair of life?

Some critics may abhor this style of past reflection that is compressed into fun without the reality of struggles to succeed in life....but after all, this is a film that is remarkable in magic and should be dedicated to Parisian lovers.",1502236800,,1627,4.648083623693379

4839397,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Strange but fun.  I guess I've never seen a Woody Allen movie and (from reading other reviews) this must be his style.  I like time travel movies, but I prefer there to be an explanation for why it happens (even if it's a wacky one).  We don't get one this time.  I thought the protagonist was a dork, but he was so sincere that I mostly forgave him for that.  There was a plot hole, I think--when Gil read in a book that something happened, then went to great lengths to make it happen, but it didn't really happen.  But then something more unexpected happened, and kind of made up for that.  Gil seems to fall in love rather easily (which makes it convenient when things don't work out), but I'm glad he got his happy ending.

It was fun seeing various artists and writers from history interacting with each other, and the actors portrayed them in a way that made me interested to look up some of their work.  I also liked the basic moral of the story.  However, I was only prompted to write a review when I laughed out loud at one line.  I'll be using it when someone talks nonsense.

the plot

Gil and his fianc Inez tag along to Paris with her snooty parents for a holiday. Gil is a Hollywood screenwriter who is in the middle of writing his first novel, a story about an antique shop with wonderful things from his youth and before. As is the story in his book, his time in Paris is also making him feel nostalgic for a past hes never known, and longs to be living in 1920s Paris, his ideal golden era. His wife Inez is unsupportive, and seems to have a thing for her ex, Paul who just so happens to be simultaneously vacationing here. Inez drags Gil along to museums with this obnoxious know-it-all Paul, as their tour guide.

 One night, feeling down, drunk and unappreciated he walks the streets of Paris. At midnight, an antique car pulls up to where Gil is and urges him to enter. He goes along and discovers that hes been transported somehow back to the 1920s and in a bar conversing with Ernest Hemmingway, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter etc. He asks Hemmingway if hed read his novel, he refuses but suggests Gertrude Stein, as she reads all of his unpublished works. When he returns the next night, he goes to Steins home and meets Pablo Picasso and his mistress Adrianna. Gil likes Adrianna and spends a lot of time here with her, only to find out that she longs for a golden age herself, from right at the turn of the century.

the breakdown

 I haven't heard of this film, but gave it a chance on Amazon Instant Video when I found it was a Woody Allen film, and when they gave me a credit for a free rental. Woody has that sharp and quick sense of humor that I can really appreciate. I also like Rachel McAdams and Owen Wilson a bunch, and they were fine here. Although I ached for Woody himself and his unmatched reactionary reflexes in the lead, Owen Wilson was a charismatic replacement. Owens demeanor naturally takes a slow, laid back kind of pace where Woodys East Coast paranoia gives him a much quicker wit. The character would have to be rewritten, plus unfortunately Woody is much too old.

 Rachel McAdams, a beautiful actress plays a kind of grown up version of her Hot Chick character, a self-absorbed snob who has little patience. The two are a mismatch from the start. Rachel is used way too little, but her overall presence is felt. McAdams has a thing for her real life boyfriend Michael Sheen who plays Paul. Sheen was perfect for the obnoxious twit know-it-all type who just gets under your skin.

 The major draw for me was the magical aspect where we meet these great people from our past and how these folks would possibly dismiss our main character Gil, but since he has the knowledge of their future makes him interesting. This is a terrific romantic comedy with a serving fantasy. Another winner from Woody Allen.

4839419,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is a Woody Allen flick, but don't let this turn you off. Allen has finally made a flick that is not pretentious, overbearing, and is actually worth watching...over and over again. This is now on my list of all time favorite movies.

The only turn off is the left wing agenda being shoved down your throat. The digs and misrepresentation that conservatives are communists (a liberal view and belief they are comfortable in proclaiming to the world) , cold, heartless to human suffering, pompous, shallow, blood thirsty, racists, etc. is to be expected of Allen but this one is so overboard that I did actually turn it off the first time I watched it but am glad I gave it a second chance.
The left wing agenda is surmised in this line. Where he pushes his delusional propaganda and rhetoric.
"" You always take the side of the help. That's why Daddy says you're a communist.""

My favorite line is delivered in such a way that you can envision the city in the rain as you walk the streets at night.
""Can you picture how drop dead gorgeous this city is in the rain?""

I am bibliophile and enjoy stories that have depth and delve into the subtle nuance of the human heart and soul seeking more than the instant gratification of life today and this movie is all about the nuance, the written word, and characters who can grasp the subtlety of life beyond the immediate and have heart and soul. Gil just ""gets it""

The bibliophile in me loved the characters of Hemingway,  Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald. How exciting would that be to be transported to a time when some our literary greats are gathered and creating our best works!

The film is about a writer who feels he was born in the wrong era. While in Paris with his fiancee, they run into her obnoxious rich friends. The writer can't get along with them because they're unbearably pretentious, so he makes an excuse to wander off on his own. He comes upon a certain street where, at midnight each night, a carriage takes passengers back in time. When he realizes what's happening, and that all the colorful characters he's meeting are his literary heroes, he schedules more and more meetings with them, even getting their input on his current manuscript. He even falls in love with a woman from the era, and his lies in the present begin to compound and confuse his modern life.

I love time travel movies, which is what I thought that this movie was going to be.  Not really.

Gil just ends up in 1920 (from 2010), just by getting into a car.  Except for hookers (this is not ""Pretty Woman""), who would jump into a car full of strangers at midnight in an unfamiliar city and drink whatever they offered?  Gil had no idea where this car would take him or what these people might do to him.  Gil didn't behave like an intelligent man, instead, he behaved like Alice in Wonderland.  There was never an explanation of how he time traveled, and there was never an explanation of how he always ended up safely back in his hotel room afterward.  His fianc&eacute; didn't care what he did every night - - her father was the only one who was interested.  Gil easily fell in love with someone else and completely forgot about his fiance.  How do you go on vacation with your fianc&eacute; and then go off alone every night?  (And what kind of a name is Inez?)

I found the constant name-dropping in 1920 very annoying.  This movie is about let's see how many famous people Gil can meet from 1920, in a couple of nights, all in one place... and all of these famous people instantly like Gil and want to spend all of their evenings with him.

There were good actors in this movie, and they were wasted on this ridiculous script.  I especially love Kathy Bates.

This movie was too long and very boring.  The 1920 scenes obviously tried really hard to be amazing and magical, but they were just boring.  The 2010 scenes were even more boring.  The entire movie made no sense at all.  I didn't care what happened to the characters.  I just kept waiting for a twist that never happened.

4839448,4,B005MYEQ4U,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I made the mistake of respecting online reviews for this film and delayed watching for some time. However, I liked the idea of time travel in Paris and thought perhaps the reviews were misleading and over critical. Wow, was I right in that assessment!!

If you have any notion of the music, art and literary genius of the '20s, Paris intrigue, and fantasy, this film is definitely for you. I was swept up in the concept and did not digress into the explicit formalities of complicated technical issues clearly ignored in this film.

I enjoyed the excitement of anticipation of interaction with so many illustrious artists and philosophers and invited discourse of who, when and where I would prefer to explore. This era probably fits the bill for most and addresses mostly romantic gestures of vague recall to move the plot along.

I am a futurist and spend little time thinking about what period I would like to visit in the past. Perhaps hanging out with Amelia Earhart on her last voyage, or Patton on his quest to quell Hitler's war machine? I am reminded of the remark by Owens that the past is not quite as romantic with the concept of lack of antibiotics. Only ONE effective reminder that is most sobering about a yearning for simpler times.

The ubiquitous guitar riff used incessantly throughout the film was extremely annoying but not more so than McAdam's portrayal of a high maintenance bride. Hard to ignore but when midnight strikes all is forgiven when the true adventure ensues.

The arbitrary voyage to ""La Belle Epoque"" was unexpected and further complicated the plot to appreciate a bygone era but did serve to exploit the imagination on why so many view the past with such reverence.

Many of my friends claim that the 50's were the Golden Era. Bolderdash I proclaim! Did they forget about how smoking was encouraged as seXy? And so many women just wanting to get married and never contribute to society or the family income? Or, well you get the idea, rainbows and lollipop thinking.

I am so pleased that this type of intellectual (well vs current offerings) script is mainstream and available to us who crave mental stimulation. I highly recommend this film for the many fantasy elements, Francophiles, and sumptuous scenes that excite beyond convention.

4839454,2,B005MYEQ4U,"It was clearly an attempt at fun whimsy with a period flair, and while it succeeded at the period flair it failed at the fun part.  The acting was transparent, the direction weak, and the plot unbearable.

The modern-day scenes and storyline were awful.  Why were these two people engaged in the first place when they clearly hate each other?  Why was this private detective introduced when he had no meaning at all for the plot?  How could anyone pretend to like the cartoonishly arrogant Paul?

The period scenes, although campy, were somewhat more enjoyable, if only for the great set design and costuming and the unabashed fantasizing of life in the roaring 20s.  Unfortunately, they were also tainted by bad (lazy?) directing and halting acting.  Corey Stoll's Hemingway, for example, was abominable, which is a drag because he (Stoll, not Hemingway) is usually great, but you get the sense that he was instructed to be that bad.

And of course, the viewer as usual is forced to experience this fantasy through the eyes of Woody Allen's surrogate character Gil.  I had trouble rooting for him except to cheer on the end of his relationship.

4839519,5,B005MYEQ4U,"While bored one evening my wife and I searched Netflix for something to watch we stumbled across this movie which sounded interesting from the brief description.  At first reading you would get a sense of ""Back to the Future"" or ""Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure"" but the movie is really nothing like that.

Midnight in Paris is a very original film and makes the viewer really think about what it would be like to visit a different time period in history.  The whole film takes place in Paris.  It has a wonderful opening sequence of historical things and places around the city similar to the movie ""Philadelphia"" and many other films showcasing the highlights of the city before jumping into the story.

The plot is pretty straightforward and simple the movie is about a screenwriter named Gil who wants to be a novelist.  Gil takes his fianc Inez to Paris where they are vacationing and going over wedding plans with her parents.  Gil is taken by the city of Paris and all its charms.  He loves all the art history and wishes he could go back in time to a different era Paris in the 1920s to visit his literary heros in person.  Inez on the other hand thinks Paris is a bore and doesnt like the weather.  While taking a walk at night and getting lost he stops to rest and goes for a car ride that sends him back in time to Paris in the 1920s where he interacts with several of the greatest writers and painters the world has ever known.  Gil loves going back in time and has a blast but has a choice to make does he want to live in the world of the past or be in the present.

The movie has a fascinating premise.  I mean just about all of us would like to go back in time to meet historical people or be present for historical events that shaped history.  Me personally I would love to go back to the mid to late 1970s and see all the great classic rock bands in their prime when going to a concert was affordable $5 a ticket.  What is great about the film is every time Gil goes back to the 1920s you wonder who he going to run into next.  This gives the film a lot of intrigue and suspense.  Not being an English major it made me want to know who some of these famous figures were.

Wooden Allen always makes interesting films you have to give him that.  Though he maybe the ugliest leading man in the history of cinema, slender geeky looking guy he does a great job in the directors chair.  This film is no different; by the time it ends you actually want the film to keep going to see what happens next.  I was surprised Gil did not hit it off with the museum guide actress Carla Bruni because they seemed to have some chemistry, besides his obvious attraction to Gabrielle the antique shop owner.

Overall I would rate this film 4  stars it is definitely interesting and fun to watch.  My wife was also sad to see it end so abruptly.  The film definitely leaves you wanting more at the finish of the movie.  Owen Wilson does a great job in the movie as Gil and has a lot of charisma onscreen.  I would definitely recommend the movie for something different out of the ordinary.",1479168000,,3088,4.279310344827586

That said, this, at least from the standpoint of someone with a literary background, is one of his best movies. The realistic existential writerly angst that Owen Wilson portrays is relatable and entertaining at the same time. The representations of artists, writers, filmmakers, etc. is remarkable and true to various sources including such books as Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast. There are just so many layers that I was still finding new stuff to appreciate within the movie after 10 or more viewings.",1474156800,,584,5.157894736842105

I would much rather see a few developed characters instead of the name dropping that took place. It is also hard to understand Owen Wilson's speech.  His voice reflection never seems to fit the lines or situation.  I think someone with a little more gusto should have been cast.,1472428800,,421,4.526315789473684

4839640,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Watching this gorgeous movie is like a trip to Paris without the headache of flying and long lines at the airport. It's like stepping into a dream. Luke Wilson and Rachel McAdams are a superbly mismatched couple that have their moment of matrimonial disharmony while in Paris, with her parents, no pressure. Ha!
When the clock strikes twelve Wilson is FINALLY treated to a piece of magic, by getting into the car with Zelda and going to a party back in time to meet Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, all the greats. It's amazing.

One of Woodie Allen's absolute best films. I like it better than The Purple Rose of Cairo, which is REALLY good, and rate it close to Annie Hall. Close. The thing Woody Allen always gets right is the perfection in packaging a solidly crafted film with a perfect cast, time period music from beginning to end; everything always comes together.

The opening of this movie is so richly beautiful, lush with Paris in all her beauty. Impossible not to love it!",1472428800,,997,4.691428571428571

The music alone at the opening of the film is enough to rate the whole enterprise 5 stars.  My only regret is that Woody Allen is now a bit too old to play the leading man.  I would have given anything to watch Woody confront the pretentious Hemingway.  Tom Hiddleston is far better here as Scott Fitzgerald than he is in The Night Manager.

there, I took a picture of the only window in that room. My co-worker said in my ear, Capn, you just took a picture of a window, what would you do that for, weirdo? I didn't answer him then, yet in fact I wasn't taking a picture of a window, but the only window of an Officer's room in a 19th-century European military fortress that was right at the border between France and Germany amid the French-Prussian War. He didn't know that he had to think I was weird because of the simple difference between us; some people see things that all the others miss. I was seeing an Officer in his desk deep in thought looking out the window in the middle of the dreadful war

I highly recommend you to watch the film if you like the story 'cause you will love the movie too.

Let me preface this review by stating, I do not like Woody Allen.  I do not want to get in to all the reasons for this but the most relevant one is that I generally do not enjoy his style of film making.  I originally saw Midnight in Paris on cable television, and I was in an open mood, so I watched it.  It didn't hurt that I find Owen Wilson to be generally funny and that I have a crush on Rachel McAdams!  At 100 minutes, the movie is not too long and was very amusing.  It plays like a vignette and Francophiles will enjoy the Parisian setting, both old and new.  The music helps capture the French flavor, though it can be repetitive at times.  The visual grandeur of nighttime in Paris along the River Seine and the iconic Eiffel Tower lit up in the background is enough to make any jaded and cynical heart long for a romance in the City of Light.  For those interested in historical tourism, the Palace of Versailles is also showcased.

The role of burnt-out Hollywood screenwriter-turned hopeful novelist Gil is portrayed by Owen Wilson.  Rachel McAdams impresses in a well-acted role that gets you to hate her as Inez, Gils insufferably materialistic shrew of a fianc.  Gil is in the midst of a vacation in Paris with Inez and his disapproving in-laws-to-be as they prepare for the wedding.  Gil is afflicted with a sense of hopeless romanticism and sees his time in Paris as a way to gain inspiration for his new novel.  Inez and her parents do little more in Paris than get caught up in the petty posturing that affluent high-society types can be prone to when traveling in Europe.  Stuck with a fianc that incessantly nags, criticizes, and puts him down (along with her parents), Gil finds respite in his nostalgic worship of what he considers the Golden Age of Paris  the roaring 1920s.  Paris at that time was home to several famous cultural figures in literature, art, and music.  Wandering back to his hotel late at night, Gil is stopped by a classic automobile from the 1920s, complete with revelers dressed in attire of that period.  They beckon him to join them and soon enough, Gil is transported to 1920s Paris, meeting famous literary figures as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, and famous musical composer and songwriter, Cole Porter.

For several nights, Gil returns to 1920s Paris to have his work critiqued by Gertrude Stein, courtesy of an introduction by Hemingway, each time meeting another famous artist or another writer.  Without completely giving away the rest of the story, Gil meets Adriana (portrayed by the lovely Marion Cotillard) an artistic muse, and begins to fall in love with her as the prospect of returning to the present that holds Inez and all his unhappiness and problems becomes less appealing.  Through his conversations with Adriana, Gil learns a lesson about nostalgia and how it becomes rose-colored blinders when regarding the past.

As I said before, I do not like Woody Allen or his movies.  However, Midnight in Paris has the perfect combination of a star-filled roster with many surprise and hilarious cameos, the backdrop of Paris, France, a little sci-fi time traveling twist, fun dialogue mixed with humorous moments, and notable cultural icons from the 1920s to draw anyone in looking for a cute, charming story to pass some time with.  Get lost in Paris for a bit!",1464307200,,3381,4.7172061328790456
4839709,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is a good film to watch after reading Hemingway's A Moveable Feast due to its incorporation of characters from the book. Set in modern day Paris, a newly engaged couple visits the city when a writer, Gil played  by (owen Wilson) makes an unexpected discovery while working on his next novel, while also dealing with relationship problems. The film is engaging with its characters and will leave you wanting to visit France just as Hemingway did. Owen Wilson brings a good amount of comedy to the film and has you rooting for his character the entire time. The characters out of A Moveable Feast are all spot on with how they were depicted in the book, and the film creates a new twist with their interaction with Gil. The film also adds a new face to many well known names of the past with the way they are portrayed. Overall, it was a solid film with a good cast and storyline, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys art, romance, and comedy!",1464307200,2,955,4.457142857142857
4839710,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I actually really enjoyed this movie.  I found it to be enlightening and it was also the first movie I actually really disliked Rachel McAdams.  She has never played a bitch so impeccably before and I was very impressed because I didn't know she was able to do it so convincingly.  I had read the book A Moveable Feast just before seeing the movie and I think it really made the movie that much more enjoyable, even though I didn't enjoy the book.  It made the references to Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein really come to life.  It made me able to see them in a way I probably wouldnt have been able to had I not read the book, especially so close to seeing the movie.  It is a movie that really encompasses the theme of the grass is greener because characters are always talking about how much better the past was and how they want to go there.  Owen Wilson is one of them and thinks 1920s is the Golden Age and is able to actually go there, but when he gets there another character from the 20s wants to go to the 1890s because she thinks thats the Golden Age.  When they got to the 1890s the characters there were saying how they wished they could go to the Renaissance because thats the Golden Age.  They all want to keep going back further truly believing it was better than what they currently had.  In reality, going into the past was their way to escape the present and whatever made them unhappy there.  The past is easier because we know what we are getting because its already happened.  The present and the future either are happening or haven't happened yet and there is so much beyond our control that it is terrifying and overwhelming sometimes.  There are other times, though, that it can be exciting and incredible if we do it right and just let it.",1464134400,,1785,4.372727272727273
4839711,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight in Paris

I will start by saying I saw this movie in the theater the month before its national release. I also saw it three more times in the theater after that point. I now own the video as well. This movie is a quintessential love letter to Paris from Woody Allen. From the cinematography to the music to the views, it has positioned itself securely in my top favorite movies of all time. I am a Paris, France lover. The details that Allen captures in this masterpiece from the monuments to the people of the era are precise. It gives the viewer the sense they are actually living in Paris from the breaking scene of Paris at dawn through night fall and finishing off with the glittering lights of the Eiffel Tower.

We have our subject  Gil Pender who is unhappy with his life in Los Angeles as a ""film hack."" He is attempting to become a novelist. Saturated in Paris, France where all the great writers and artists of the 1920's, you hope his location has some catalyst on his writing skills. He is trapped in what appears to be a very unfulfilled relationship with his demanding fiance Ines played by Rachel McAdams (who incidentally plays the b word so well, it is ridiculous). It takes another character in the movie Adriana played by the lovely Marion Cotillard who embodies the essence of Coco Chanel to help Gil see where he is going wrong in life. It seems to always be the case in life, where one needs to see it happening to someone else to realize they are, in fact, making the same mistake.

Gil thankfully opens his eyes by the end of the movie and experiences the peripeteia moment we all hope he has. This movie is filled from beginning to end with rich historic Parisian life. Keep your eyes open as you will see many notable historic figures within the art community from directors, singers, songwriters, writers, and painters. This movie is too good to miss. It is like bringing home a slice of a life you never knew you wish you had had!",1464048000,2,1968,4.458333333333333

While taking in the sights and touring the city, Gil manages to get away walking alone in the late evenings. On a succession of nights, at the stroke of midnight, he imagines himself being transposed back into the 1920s time matrix. He meets and is entertained by Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Linda and Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, and Pablo Picasso and his French girlfriend Adriana from Bordeaux. The Adrianna who had the affair with Modigliani then Braque, which is how Pablo met her. Adrianna then leaves Pablo and flies to Africa with Hemingway. Gil wishes, has nostalgia, that he could live in the '20s. Nostalgia is a denial of the painful present. The erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in. Flawed thinking in those finding it difficult to cope with the present.

It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.  But I am perplexed as to why this was nominated for Best Picture in 2012, or why it won Best Original Screenplay.

4839768,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Undoubtedly Woody Allen's best movie since his last best movie. This really is one of my favorite movies of all time, including the time when I used to watch lots of movies, and the time when I watched none at all.

The casting is perfection in a tea cup... a nice tea cup... probably made of china... with flowers and stuff painted on it... the type you used to get at your Grandma's house on special occasions.

Sorry, where was I? Oh, yeah, the cast. Owen Wilson plays his part with all the neurotic mannerisms of a young Woody Allen, and the rest of the actors support him superbly. Special mentions go to Corey Stoll, Kathy Bates, Adrian Brody, Marion Cotilard and Rachel McAdams. When I found out that none of them were nominated for any major awards, I was so disappointed that I stamped my feet 14 times in a row, only stopping once to take some vitamins.

The cinematography, by Darius Khondji, is also breathtaking.  I mean, it's not hard to make Paris look beautiful, but the whole movie has a strange hue that gives it a magical quality. I've been to Paris many times, and every time I watch this movie  which is about once a day, and twice a day at weekends  it makes me want to go back. Watching this is really the next best thing to being there.

If you don't like this film then you should never be allowed to use the words beautiful or charming again. I'm afraid you will probably die alone, in a cheap flea-ridden motel, near the airport, with a family sized can of Campbell's chicken soup spilled all down your front.

Humor abounds as the movies protagonist, played by Owen Wilson, infuses his experiences from the 1920's with the current time in which he lives, and vice versa.

I felt so much like this; fifty years ago, wishing I had lived in either period before the World became a Nuclear Hostage to the Bomb! and now Terrorism.  Oh, to live in a better time when things were simpler, but as Wilson's character pointed out;  the lack of antibiotics and the medicine of the 19th century, lacking understanding i of microbiology and infection would not, in reality, be an ideal!.

(definitely a departure and unusual for Woody Allen, and most welcome, because i hate his stuff) But it has a lesson, everybody has their own time to live in because they don't see their present as exciting. I can agree with that. Pretending being at a cafe in Paris is a good thing. You live in your mind, you really do. You have your own romantic idea about places, you really do, and that is great. Besides, this place of our present sucks. Remember, this IS a false roguedimension {which has been projected by a succubus dynamic; a vampire scorpion-equation}. It must Betray us and sting us when we do honor so laughing at the comedy of it all is a good thing. ~ Red Pill IRF And with that, may I once again raise a toast to Mirthful Irreverence Everywhere. Simple movies like this are good. Living in the inspiration of your mind is a good Changeling Place to stay.

Seems like he was miscast. Nothing very original or thought provoking about the plot, in fact, it is radically simple, so much that it's a let down. But it's somewhat amusing and it's got Marillon Cotillard and a number of other good French actors. I would recommend just watching some good French cinema instead of this film, if you want to enjoy some real French culture. This is like the simple fantasy of an American, weekend tourist in Paris, with some cute Woody Allen lines thrown in here and there (nothing as rich as his earlier movies).",1450656000,,717,4.698412698412699

But for those of us living and often struggling in Paris, we would say that the streets are never that void of people, clean, rose-smelling, and quiet. When it pours, you're more likely to curse after blindly sprint-sliding across dog poop or vomit (or both) only to have the wretched metro slam its doors on your soppy nose after the obnoxious beep of the last midnight train out of George V. And to be honest, most of us don't have reason to be out that way, except perhaps for the occasional yearly stroll to visit the Christmas market. And modern Parisians are becoming a more colourful and talkative bunch, thanks to their penchant for British and American telly and film (and Starbucks and Subway ??). Indeed, reality is less charming to film, but it would have been interesting to see more use of the modernity to contrast the time disparity. Or not.

I wanted to see it because for once he wasn't in his own movie, but his Owen Wilson avatar pretty much counted as an appearance by him anyway: rich, whiny, pretentious, and narcissistically neurotic. I was so uninterested in what was happening between the characters I ended up watching YouTube videos on my phone, and when I'd tune back into the movie I felt like I hadn't missed anything important because nothing had changed or developed.
The characters were dull and pompous--the only one I wasn't completely irritated by was Gertrude Stein, and I admit I was charmed by Adrian Brody's Salvador Dali. Marion Cotillard is a marvelous actress, so to watch her playing such a one-dimensional character was painful: the movie teaches us nothing about Adrienne except that she happens to have an impressive resum of illustrious lovers. As for Gil, I kept hoping that he would miraculously come across some inner strength or SOMETHING, any kind of character development at all, and yet there was none. So he ditches his spoiled, square, obviously-completely-wrong-for-him fiancee in the end. Hardly revelatory.",1450483200,6,1249,5.067961165048544

The same childish jokes about 'right-wing' corporate men - Allen doesn't seem to have matured or become less shallow as a person or artist in all the decades he has been making films. Alas, he seems to have the prestige factor and can rope in talented actors who each has his or her own style ( Owen Wilson is a great comedic actor) who all become cardboard cutouts with the weird Allen-like speech patterns. Allen keeps churning out third-rate scripts, resting on the laurels of his '70s movies (the only good ones since then have been 'Purple Rose of Cairo', 'Hannah and her Sisters' and 'Bullets Over Broadway' as far as I'm concerned.

4839917,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I love anything that Owen Wilson plays in and was not disappointed in his performance here. In some of the scenes you knew what he was thinking without him saying a word--his expressions said it all. Such as at one time when he was utterly confused about where he was and how he got there, as you watched his face you could see the confusion and as you kept watching you could tell when the confusion cleared up for him and how he had made up his mind just to enjoy his environment--all without vocally expressing his thoughts.

I really enjoyed this time travel adventure--a fantasy that I am sure we have always wished we could experience once in our life time. I loved how Wilson got to met and got to know some very famous people in from our past. If these people were really like that in real life, then it was a real education. I think my favorite was Hemingway.

The scenes in Paris were beautiful and made me wish I could travel there and see it all for myself. This story had no sex scenes in it and no foul language, which I appreciated--it just goes to show you that good movies don't have to have to be filled with vulgar language and steamy sex to be a good movie.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because as one reviewer stated, the ending was a little abrupt. Oh, it had an ending with a conclusion it just felt as if there should have been just a little bit more.

Actually this film surprised me with it's verve, energy-crackling through cast and crew, a damn fine presentation of time finding, without being burdensome in why it couldn't work.  Oh, it COULD, we were told. But someone else thought better, and traded our win for two orders of large fries, one chilli dog, one jalapeno popper, 2 cokes and one milkshake.  Any flavor that's fresh. ""Huh""....don't count on that,""  and ducked as the first travel shot fills itself in for the viewer.  Lovely transitions, always done for enlightenment, only recently rejected by the first lady, choices made by her personal and party-supported funding fountain; what really happened here?  Doom, gloom, and yet another ending of the world pre-view?  Maybe. Maybe not so much, that.  There is some concern expressed in dialogue than in action, at least on the surface.  We are left to much speculation once beliefs and behaviors of some (despicable) young woman; boors if ever I knew that type.  Posh? NOT!

4839919,5,B005MYEQ4U,"First of all, I must confess I am not the biggest Woody Allen fan. My bias is kind of like Gills bias against Tea Party Republicans: You cannot always judge by past experiences, or by appearances or hearsay. This film is by far one of my favorites ever. Not only was it superbly acted by an actor who is often cast in quirky roles (Owen Wilson), but the film brought to life some of my favorite American writers, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. This film is an inspiration to writers who dream of Paris as the muse for their stories to come alive.
I have never experienced Paris, but after watching the film I understand now why I love the landscape of Washington, D.C.  Although I am quite sure its grandeur is nothing compared to that of Paris, there is a romantic and mysterious feel, especially at night when the lights come on. Allen captures the romance that is synonymous with Paris with the cinema-photography and a script that brings alive Fitzgerald and Hemingway like the protagonists in their stories.
For a man so obviously tormented by the experiences of war, Hemingway sure had a way of encouraging those around him to pursue their hopes and dreams. Much of his strength was in the depth of simplicity, and Allen captured that in the memorable lines Hemingway spoke in the film. The relationship between Hemingway, Adriana, and Gill was reminiscent of the triangle between Jake, Brett, and Cohn in The Sun Also Rises. F. Scott and Zeldas relationship immediately sparks the connection between the anguish and inadequacy the male protagonists experience in Fitzgeralds stories. Allens perfectly worded script instantly threw me into Winter Dreams and of course The Great Gatsby. Something about Zelda reminds me of Henry James Daisy Miller.
My favorite line of the film is in Gills moment where he one-ups the know-it-all Paul about one of Picassos paintings. This moment is a statement in what the Golden Age represented in that the writers and artists of the Lost Generation may have seemed like they were wandering aimlessly, but they were living their dreams, experiencing life--rather than settling for something that they read about in a book.

It also becomes apparent he and his fiancee don't see eye-to-eye on a lot. Anyway, one night while wanting to do something other than the rest of the crowd he is with (as usual) an old car shows up offering him a lift as he was lost trying to get back to the hotel. Turns out to be old literary writers, painters, etc in Paris in a different era--Hemingway, Stein, Twain, Picasso, etc. He goes back each night to run around town with them.

The idea, I guess, is that Paris had inspired all of those greats and they will inspire him if he lets it. It is a city of ""artists"".

I thought this movie was cartoonish at best. They could have easily made a movie about the dynamics of the relationship between the writer and fiancee. Yes, it would have been just another one of those. But at least it was important. Why the ghosts etc? It was as if they were trying to say how important Paris was. It was almost like public relations for Paris and only that.

Besides, for people like me who think that Hemingway was waaaaaaay over rated and who find nothing to celebrate in the break out debauchery of the artist characters of the 1920s the silly plot line involving them is just eye rolling. If anyone had even half read the history of this era they would know that these people are white washed today in order to celebrate them because they were too scandalous, immoral, amoral, deviant and trashy back then--even today--to survive and fit in in their own countries. They had to go to Paris, Berlin and Shanghai to live ""they way that they wanted to live"". They were disgusting.

But in the end, Woody Allen uses this fantasy tale as a platform to shoot down all things traditional & conservative and elevate irresponsible hedonism and selfishness, all under the facade of his worship of literary and artistic greats from times past. Definitely keeps your attention, but it's basically infantile in its premise. While he does a good job of showing the gorgeous setting that is Paris, as well as communicating our tendency to romanticize the past as always being better than the present, he creates unrealistic characters who only existed for his protagonist's journey. Everyone was two-dimensional and white-washed; however, that's the only way to depict the hedonistic lifestyle. You can't include its natural, even deadly, consequences. Woody shows himself to be a die-hard romantic, but he still hasn't learned that traditional values hold the key to the stability and satisfaction for which he so desperately searches. He wants a guilt-free, hedonistic existence without its pain and accountability; and, as always, you can only find it in the movies.",1449187200,,1111,5.354285714285714

4840138,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I will admit that I occasionally find no interest in movies based on their title and cover.  ""Midnight in Paris"" happened to be one of those that I had no desire to watch. Frankly, I'm not that interested in vacationing in Paris, so I thought the movie wouldn't interest me if that happened to be the subject matter.  I knew it did well in Oscar nominations and wins for Woody Allen, but it didn't incite me to watch it anyway.

So here we are, four years later, and I rent it on Amazon Prime streaming instant video.  What a fantastic romantic comedy with a message that, for me as an author, goes straight to my heart.

Meet Gil Pender, a screenwriter and hopeful novelist, who is vacationing in Paris.  He is somewhat like me in the fact that he fantasizes about eras past. For him, it's the 1920's in Paris, while for me I'm stuck in the Victorian Era.  Gil thinks that life must have been really peachy in Paris with the great upcoming artists of its time like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Stein, Picasso, and many others.  In fact, he is so in love with Paris, that he tries to talk his fiancee to moving there to live after they marry. However, she's more of a realist and really wants to stay in the states in Malibu and Hollywood.

One evening, when his girlfriend would rather go dancing than walk back to the hotel with him, they go their separate ways. Gil wanders around the city trying to find his way back.  A classic car from the past pulls up and stops. The occupants encourage him to take a ride with him, so he climbs in for fun, drinks, and the time of his life. They arrive at a party, and low and behold, he's been transported back into 1920 meeting the people he has admired his entire life. When he returns to reality, his fiancee thinks he has a brain tumor. Nevertheless, each night he goes back, and when the clock strikes midnight, his ride returns for another adventure.

The story is filled with wonderful themes, and for me as an author, I laughed, oohed, and awed, over some stellar lines.  When Gil asks Hemingway to read his book, he replies, ""If it's bad, I'll hate it because I hate bad writing, and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate all the more. You don't want the opinion of another writer.""

However, the most poignant part of the movie is the theme that those who are nostalgic about former eras, thinking they were better than the present, are misguided.  Michael Sheen, who plays a know-it-all vying for the affections of Gil's girlfriend, states this one spot-on statement.

""Nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful present... the name for this denial is golden age thinking - the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in - it's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present.""

Of course, as a writer of historical romances, and understanding the need for women who read them, it is quite true. The magic realization is that each generation feels the same. A woman that Gil falls for in the 1920's, dreams about living in the Belle Epoque time period (the overlapping era of Victorian and Edwardian). That generation probably fantasized about the Regency era.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. It was lighthearted, thought provoking, and some of the lines were diamonds.  Woody Allen is a genius at times, and his multiple awards for the screenplay were well deserved.",1448755200,2,3431,4.542207792207792

From the All Star cast to the feeling of being swept away into the past to actually live out that age old question of who would you like to meet if you could go back in time. This movie makes you laugh but it also makes you look at life and make every moment count. It also gives you this overwhelming desire to go to Paris and take a walk in the rain.

Wonderful movie.  I like to watch Woody Allen movies from time to time to move away from the over-stimulated Hollywood Mega Productions.  Some say he is a cookie cutter when it comes to the type of characters that are in the films but it's the story line that really makes it an enjoyable film.  This movie, along with ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona"", are just a few of Allen's films I do enjoy.

4840172,1,B005MYEQ4U,"The premise and trailer looked good, but we couldn't get through twenty minutes of this film.

In general characters is a movie or book have to be somewhat likeable for the viewer or reader to care about them, and to want to invest time in following their story. I hated the characters and really couldn't relate to them.

The young couple and the two parents seemed like super rich, snobby people that I couldn't really relate to. Who goes to Paris to tag along on a parent's business trip and spends their time wearing perfectly pressed clothes and drinking wine from the sixties? Not anyone I know. I had a hard time feeling bad for Gil, who was a screenwriter living in Malibu trying to make it and write his first book. You're in Paris and it's beautiful! By the time I got to the scene in front of Versailles, I found myself more interested in looking at the background of the scene (i.e. Versailles) and wishing the characters would stop talking and stop blocking my view.

I wasn't really convinced by any of the characters from the 1920s, either. They all seemed a bit like caricatures of the historical figures...a bit like Robin Williams' Theodore Roosevelt in ""Night at the Museum""...amusing, but not really believable. I really like period pieces from the 1920s, like ""Downton Abbey"" or ""Boardwalk Empire"", but I wasn't really convinced with the characters and setting here.

Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and Kathy Bates all turn in fine performances with an extended cast of characters. Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Man Ray, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway and Josephine Baker et al. provide the film's biggest fireworks in their ""cameo"" appearances!!

4840206,4,B005MYEQ4U,This is a fun Woody Allen movie about a guy that travels back in time at midnight to meet his hero authors in their hay day. The time traveler does not match up to the character of the people he meets but nevertheless they are all happy to see him. An enjoyable movie but the main character could have done more that mainly being awed.,1448323200,,335,4.1692307692307695
4840207,5,B005MYEQ4U,"What an absolutely perfect movie. Everything about this movie is fantastic, but particularly Woody Allen's photography of Paris. The opening 10-minute sequence of Paris in the rain is worth the price of the film. I traveled in Paris for a short while and wish I had seen this film first--I would have gone looking for some of the locations. In light of the recent events in Paris, I rewatched this film and it is just a beautiful tribute to that incredible city.

The storyline of the film is very interesting: Owen Wilson (fantastic in this role) plays a writer who travels to Paris with his wife and her family and while the wife and family are spending all the money they possibly can in Paris, Wilson's character spends his nights wandering the city streets. During one of his midnight walks he encounters a magical time-traveling adventure that introduces him to some of the great artistic and literary characters of a time long past. If you live time travel, you'll love them movie--I won't say more.

The most beautifully filmed movie I've ever seen--and it has made me realize, I must return to Paris.",1448323200,3,1109,4.740932642487047

The film was predictable and Wilson's performance was weak. The rest of the acting was mediocre featuring lousy French accents.

4840289,5,B005MYEQ4U,"What happens in Paris after midnight? One man finds out after a rosy stroll and a few wrong turns. Gill is a hollywood screenwriter striving to be a  great American novelist visiting Paris with his high strung fianc and her uppity parents, unsure of himself, nostalgic and dissatisfied.

Woody Allen pulls all the right line to craft an elegant and charming movie. The ending is pleasant and the story throughout the movie is fairly delightful and warm, even though Gill, our protagonist, faces a series of dilemmas and unsettling realities. The use of escapism opens up whimsical possibilities that is sure to entertain.

Besides the masterful use of dialogue and themes, Allens technical prowess and direction is subtle but powerful. His use of brown and red color tones sets the movies tone in a romantic look. The pacing is brisk and light. As scenes dissolve into the next and cuts jump from one moment to another, time is not only a motif but a physical and visible expression.

My favorite part of the movie are the characters, particularly the supporting characters. It is a strong cast. To have any one of them missing would have made the movie that much less than what it is. The female actors did a stunning job, from Gertrude to Adriana to the the Parisian woman at the end. And, Hemingway sounded just like I thought Hemingway would! Hilarious. I enjoyed this movie a lot and it never got boring.",1448064000,3,1409,4.738775510204082

4840414,1,B005MYEQ4U,"I'm stunned that so many people enjoyed this film.  Rachel McAdams and Owen Wilson are a couple of my favorite actors, but the characters that they played here were 2-dimensional, cliche caricatures, lacking any depth.  Marion Cotillard (actually from Paris) pulled off her character, Adriana, but the rest of the supporting characters came off as very vaudeville.  The storyline and dialogue appear to have been written by a 12 year-old.  The nostalgic protagonist (Owen Wilson) travels in time to meet a rattled-off shopping list of famous artists and writers from earlier eras only to discover that nostalgia is a human condition afflicting all generations.  If you like realistic acting and to be pulled into a story, you will find this movie ridiculous and formulaic, trying to teach you a lesson by beating you over the head with it in the most tedious and sophomoric way.",1447632000,10,878,5.027586206896552

4840425,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I grew up dreaming about Paris. First it was because of Madame Curie and I wanted to study at the Sorbonne when I grew up. Then I fell in love with Simone de Beauvoir writings and dreamed of drinking coffee and having intellectual conversations at the Rue de Montmartre. I studied French in college, but I never made it to Paris. I saw this movie the day after the terrorists bombings, because I am saving money to finally go to Paris next summer. This movie does for Paris what Manhattan did for New York - you can feel like you are walking in the city, you can feel Allen's love and respect for what Paris is all about - the present and the past. And what a trip it is, being able to spend time with the writers and painters of the 20s when Paris was the place to go to create. I understand his trip because I go in my mind in trips like that when, for example, I go to an exhibition of Paris Posters, which depict very clearly the artistic life, it's like I walk the place.

4840451,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I'm finding it really hard to believe this sensitive, beautiful piece had anything to do with Woody Allen. It's as if he forgot about himself and vomiting therapy for an entire movie, although the protagonist talks too much as usual. It respected the intelligence of the audience rather than over explaining what was happening. The acting was beautifully understated, even though some of the actors were playing famously flamboyant personalities prior to real fame. Interesting plot, unexpected twists. Lovely ending.",1447459200,,517,5.475
4840452,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Sidney Bechet's New Orleans jazz sets the stage for Midnight in Paris, and it's not anachronistic;  New Orleans jazz, particularly that performed by Bechet and Armstrong, was popular in Paris  during the 1920's.  It's a clever, amusing piece, populated by the masters of the Arts of that time: F  Scott Fitzgerald,  Hemingway, Cocteau, Man Ray, Picasso, Cole Porter, Josephine Baker and on and on. Owen Wilson energizes the time traveling Gil Pender, a screenwriter who longs to be a novelist. I was amused that Gertrude Stein was his critic.  His love of times past makes this 1920's setting and these characters ideal. The atmospheric cinematography is excellent.  The movie is charming, not brilliant, a bit on the order of magical realism. Woody Allen and his humor were always so brainy and wonderfully irreverent.  It often went to the edge and stepped back just enough. Life and art are not discrete variables.

Addendum:  As it is the day after the horrific terrorist attack on that wonderful city, I must express my sadness and offer prayers for the French people.",1447459200,,1073,4.977528089887641

4840527,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen at his sardonic best.  Owen Wilson delivers the neurotic angst of Woody Allen with his own softening that sets well with the Parisien ambiance that is quite apart from the frenetic cadence of Allen in his native Manhattan backdrop.  The movie, for me, was also a love affair with the city itself. If there was ever a city that one could be seduced by and made love to by, it certainly is Paris at midnight in the rain.",1445904000,,430,4.3625

I've always been a serious Woody Allen fan and this movie received excellent reviews, so I was excited to see it. The present day characters are trite and one-dimensional (the classic Americans in Paris from the 20s are a bit more passable, especially Corey Stall as Hemingway), and Owen Wilson does a workmanlike Woody Allen surrogate, but PLEASE, spare me the clichs! Michael Sheen and Rachel McAdams deserved better!!",1445817600,,487,5.0246913580246915

4840531,4,B005MYEQ4U,"The movie is beautiful. It has many engaging scenes with artists of the past. An engaging movie with some flaws that got tiring toward the end. The most annoying was  Owen Wilson channeling Woody Allen. His portrayal of the artist included Woody's speech cadence and hand gesticulations. You have to wonder if that was his improvisations or if Woody was there coaching each move at the sidelines. This is the same territory that Woody always mines: the petite charm of the bourgeoisie, to borrow a phrase. The Manhattan/ Hannah and Her Sister's crowd. Always the time consuming pondering of not the upwardly mobile but the already got there. Granted the cameos were fantastic, Corey Stall, unrecognizable as  Ernest Hemingway, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scot Fitzgerald and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. It is  an evening's entertainment, even if the protagonist is a stand in.",1445644800,,872,5.041666666666667
4840532,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Despite the difficult crossing of the line between present-day American ambition and pure parody, there's a sweetness to the conceit that transcends the usual Allen targets and recent directorial weaknesses. Owen Wilson is still himself while emulating what Allen sees as his more youthful self, which outweighs the heavy-handed interpretations of the ""baddies,"" in this case his fiancee, family, and materialism. The representations of the historical characters do what's expected in Allen's satirical framework, but remain enjoyable as cameos and character sketches; for me, Marion Cotillard is the movie's heartbeat. Former French First Lady Carla Bruni adds a touch of irony by her presence. The obligatory young woman in a secondary role as street bookseller fulfills Allen's by-no-means unique obsession, but the final touch of weather will make movie-goers smile. Best prop: the time-traveling midnight taxi.",1445644800,2,915,5.735294117647059

The movie was a good Woody Allen movie, in that you have to think about what is most important to you. Today, or yesteryear? I think Owen Wilson does a good job of being a writer enthralled with ""the Golden Years"". It was fun to see Hemingway, F.Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein. Great references for literary lovers.

A magical tale, with Owen Wilson as a writer(stand in for Woody Allen)  who is in Paris with his fiancee and her parents.  One evening, he is wandering along the streets and gets lost.  At the  stroke of midnight,  he is transported back to the l920's.  A carriage arrives and the people inside (Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald) swoop him up, takes him along to a party.  He meets up with,  Picasso, Dali, Hemingway, and all the other writers and artists of the day.  They take him to their parties, introduce him to Gertrude Stein (who agrees to look over his manuscript).  When they take him back to his hotel, he's back in the present.  He does this night after night, so naturally his fiancee and her family aren't happy with this absences and strange behavior, and trouble ensues.

4840743,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This beautiful film opens with a three minute postcard styled montage of Paris, showing the iconic tourist sites filmed with a filter so colorful it almost makes the scenes look like a painting. There is a nice scene at Monet's gardens at Giverny and we also visit John XXIII Square (near Notre Dame), Montmartre, the Palace of Versailles, the Opra, the Sacr-Caeur, the le de la Cit itself, and streets near the Panthon, and the street from which Gil is taken back into the past by the Peugeot Type 176 is the Rue Saint-tienne du Mont.

The main character Gil finds himself in Paris with his fiancee and her family. He is a Hollywood scriptwriter who does not seem to excited by his work and instead dreams of being a great novelist. His favorite period in time is the 1920's and especially the ""lost generation"" which includes distinguished artists such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, T. S. Eliot, John Dos Passos, Waldo Peirce, Isadora Duncan, Abraham Walkowitz, Alan Seeger, and Erich Maria Remarque. Being in Paris, of course, he focuses on those who were in the city during the 1920s.

Late one evening, Gil leaves his party, a little intoxicated and wanders the back streets of Paris and gets lost. We hear the clock chime midnight and a 1920s Peugeot Type 176 car draws up beside him. The passengers ask him to join them. The car seems to transport him back in time and he ends up at a party thrown in honor of Jean Cocteau where he encounters Cole Porter, Alice B. Toklas, Josephine Baker,Djuna Barnes, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda.

Later he meets Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein. He also meets Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso and falls for his mistress Adriana. But the fun does not end there, he spends some time with surrealists Salvador Dal, Man Ray, and Luis Buuel and then travels back even further, to the 1890s Belle poque, where he goes to Maxim's Paris and eventually to the Moulin Rouge. There, of course he meets Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and Edgar Degas.

There are some interesting parts mixed in, like were he shows up in Adriana's book and where he gives inspiration to a young Luis Buuel for a movie plot, which we know became ""The Exterminating Angel"".

I personally hated the Paul Bates character, especially when he contradicted the Paris tour guide at the Rodin museum. His character was insufferable and made it painfully obvious why the French do not like most Americans. The only character I loved to hate more than Paul was Inez, Gil's fiance and her parents. These people just took away from the film. I understand that it was to formulate a contrast in Gil's life but I personally would have just had Gil take this adventure alone, completely without these other people in the film at all. Of course, being a Woody Allen film, I understand why they were there. Inez is the most unsupportive, rude, arrogant, selfish and unfaithful. She even admits to sleeping with Paul ""a couple of times"" and waves it off as some meaningless fling and tells Gil to get over it.

I was happy that he connected with the gal who sold things from the past and that her character brought Gils story full circle with telling him she loved to walk in Paris in the rain.

In a word, this film was enchanting...",1421625600,3,3236,4.646853146853147

4840787,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I enjoyed Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris.""  I have always appreciated Woody Allen's brand of comedy even going back to his stand up routines in the 1960' which I enjoyed on recordings.  I really liked ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.""  His latest movie, Midnight in Paris, was entertaining.  I particularly appreciated the way it presented the nostalgia dilemma as an infinite regression of disappointments.

The movie was also, sadly, a classic manque.  For years Allen has eschewed cheap political satire in his productions.  In ""Midnight in Paris"" he proves unable to resist the temptation of typical Hollywood leftism.  He could not resist exploitation of the usual leftist anti-war cliches.  His hero played by Owen Wilson is a Bush-basher opposed to the Iraq war and contending with a tea-party supporting potential father in law.  Allen set up the tea-party straw man in order to knock it down for dramatic effect.

How interesting that Allen shows an exalted reverence in his depiction of his Hemingway character while at the same time opposing war and conflict.  Did Hemingway not serve in the First World War as an ambulance volunteer?  Was Hemingway not a committed, indeed, addictive war correspondent?  Did Hemingway not try to blow Nazi submarines out of the water in his fishing boat off of Cuba?

It seems that Allen is but a pale shadow of the reflected cultural heroes for whom he feels such keen nostalgia.

In his defense, it may be argued that he did provide gainful employment for the pulchritudinous Mme. Sarkozy who did a great job in the pic, by the way.  Hard to imagine Woody hiring Laura Bush for a role though!

Grand music - ah that clarinet!  After some casting critique adjustments, the only bothersome portrayal, and, I think the director is at fault here, was the Adriana character as portrayed by Marion Cotillard.  As directed, Adriana calls forth the exceedingly annoying character in High Fidelity of Marie De Salle, performed by Lisa Bonet, but as directed by Stephen Frears.  What was Marie De Salle supposed to be?  An unforgiveable comparison, I know.  (Oh, Lawd, now I have Marie De Salle's song in my head).  Fortunately, Adriana is allowed to develop into a less ephemeral character eventually. But, after all, the characters in Midnight in Paris are stereotypical, and done to perfection, but what was Mr. Allen's idea of an 'Adriana' but that of a consummate dreamer?",1411516800,,935,5.098684210526316

4840860,3,B005MYEQ4U,"You know your summer isn't complete until youve taken a road tripon the big screen at least! The last
road trip film I reviewed was 2010s ghastly horrible Due Date. So I was relieved when a new film out of
the UK, The Trip, was a much better, more consistently funny road trip movie. Steve Coogan and the
lesser known Rob Brydon (both from the UK) play their comic selves as the two friends traveling through
England on a food tour.
Could the film have lasted about 20 minutes less? Hey, listen Im glad when a real road trip only goes 20
minutes over. Most road trip films Ive seen of late are feature lengths over! Coogan and Brydon bounce
off each other like only two well connected comics could. Their interactions are priceless--mostly inane,
off-the-cuff conversations that are captured at the heart of their intense silliness.
Dont look for a whole lot of poignancy in this film, no powerful or moving conflict. In fact, there is little
to no conflict. Still, there is a certain depth of character that keeps the dialogue more than just the two
of them being goofballs (although it is mostly that). So if you're only in it for a more than just a few
laughs, it works.
Midnight in Paris is the latest from accomplished director Woody Allen. Hey! Did I just see you roll your
eyes? Well Im glad I got my shameless self promotion in at the beginning because if you don't respect
Allens work you're not going to see this movie anyway. In fact, youve probably stopped reading this
review, right? Hello? If you do like a good Woody Allen movie, this one isn't so bad (wow, did that sound
as lame as I think it did?).
Owen Wilson plays a fairly successful screenwriter who struggles as a novelist and is infatuated with
legendary writers and artists of the past. One night, wandering the streets of Paris a little drunk, he is
picked up by a cab and transported to a place where his legends become real. Sure the movie a little too
hokey at times (especially for Allen), but Ive seen worse from the once icon.",1408406400,,2008,4.4890710382513666

He's on vacation in Paris with his fiancee and her family and while wandering around by himself one night gets picked up and taken to a party taking place in another time. This is the best thing Woody Allen has done in a while. Owen Wilson says the lines, but you can hear Woody Allen in them.

4840895,3,B005MYEQ4U,"The opening shots of Paris are wonderful.  From there the film goes downhill.  There were enough scenes of the city to keep my interest and it was fun to see the  array of actors...Adrian Brody as Dali,  Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Carla Bruni as a museum docent to name a few..

I like Owen Wilson but here he is greatly hampered by having to play Woody Allen's alter ego.  There are scenes in which it looks and sounds like he is imitating him verbatim, accompanied by the neurotic waving of hands.  Maybe just being around Allen rubs off on people or does he actually coach his actors to do that?  I recall a scene in one of his recent films in which Scarlett Johanson fell into the same, annoying speech patterns.  Rachel Mcadams does it here too.

 When Woody keeps himself out of a film it has a much better chance of succeeding.  The neurotic shlump was adorable in "":Annie Hall"" but that was a long time ago, already.  Marion Cotillard is gorgeous but even her acting seems shabby here...lots of shrugging of the shoulders and little else.  I think the problem is that all of the characters are types, so they come out as one dimensional and therefore boring.  The girlfriend is stupid, materialistic and mean, her mother is stupid, materialistic and of course Republican, etc.

The story is ok...and it's a great vehicle for showing off the beauty of Paris.  It tries for whimsical and sweet but doesn't really achieve it. Woody Allen has talent but it is not apparent here.",1403308800,3,1486,4.568181818181818

4840903,4,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight in Paris,"" a mix of comic fable and fantasy, delights the eye, tickles the mind and lifts the heart. Owen Wilson, an actor I love even though I frequently don't care for his movies, finally plays a worthy role as Gil Pender. Gil, a successful Hollywood script writer, dreams of making his mark on literature with a good novel. He idolizes the artists who gathered in Paris after World War I--Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Dali, Braque, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter--and believes he was born too late. Gil is a Woody Allen type, introspective and yearning, but as played by Wilson, less narcissistic, more open-hearted and, I must say, much better looking.

Gil comes to Paris with his beautiful, materialistic fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her conservative parents, who disapprove of Gil. Gil loves Paris and is eager to explore and visit his idols' haunts, but Inez just wants to shop and hang out with her obnoxious friends and her parents. The audience can see immediately that Gil and Inez are a mismatch, but Gil mistakes physical attraction for love. After drinking a bit too much at a wine tasting, Gil decides to go for a walk alone. At the stroke of midnight, he sits down on some steps, and a vintage Peugeot picks him up and carries him away to the 1920s.

I won't say more about the plot, but it's a joy to see wide-eyed Gil interact with his artistic heroes of the past, consider what makes art and life worthwhile, and question the direction his present is taking. There are some sweet comic moments. You'll find the glowing shots of Paris, today and as imagined 90 years ago, that you expect in a Woody Allen city valentine movie. The casting is excellent, the pace is brisk, the script is witty, and a pitch-perfect jazz soundtrack accompanies the gorgeous images and charming fable. ""Midnight in Paris"" may not have the heft or hilarity of Allen's strongest films, but within its limits, it's a delightful way to spend a couple of hours.",1402444800,,1974,4.752186588921282

It's charming, passionate about its ideas, setting, and characters, unique in its thematic exploration, and just downright perfect in nearly every sense of storytelling. Visually, it's a marvel! Allen portrays Paris in three different eras, each so stunningly formed and gorgeously captured that it comes off as ethereal. Owen Wilson hasn't been this great since his work with Wes Anderson, and Rachel McAdams and Marion Cotillard are perfect as his symbolic love interests. Corey Stoll, Kathy Bates, and Adrien Brody are also mesmerizing as Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and Dali, respectively. Simply said, there are not enough good things to say about this film.

The name dropping in the movie is fun to try to pinpoint (I had to google some of them to see which historical figure they are). I love the music - French - have put many songs on my ipod. Woody Allen is a great jazz musician himself, so I trust his taste.

Woody talks, in an interview on the features, about intentionally coloring his films this way.

As fans of Paris, we were disappointed with the look and feel of this Blu Ray.  However, we LOVE this film, with Owen Wilson, and great supporting cast.  Have seen the film over and over, and in different versions including DVD (and in the theater).  If you're the type of person willing to suspend disbelief when a film deals with fantasy elements, you'll have a great time with this film.

Note:  Owen, oddly enough, is playing a Woody Allen type character, despite the obvious difference between Owen and Woody.  Knowing that Woody has hired Owen as an avatar for himself to some extent, while mindful that Owen brings a leading man appeal Woody could never aspire to, makes this film even more interesting, we think.

Originally saw this with my buddies, and we were quoting it for months. Really glad it got recognition from the Academy. Owen Wilson does the best ""Woody Allen"" type lead since Woody himself. A lot of other guys have tried to play that type in his films (John Cusack, Jason Biggs, Jesse Eisenberg, Larry David, Josh Brolin), but none really made it their own like Owen Wilson did. Highly recommended.",1395187200,2,509,4.666666666666667

The scenery alone will have you packing your suitcase - I was making notes on the names of cafes, a bookstore, cobblestone streets and thoughts on Paris in the rain.  As a bonus, the movie is pretty darn good!",1394928000,,280,4.470588235294118
4840940,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Basically, because its essentially a theme park for adults: as Owen Wilsons character, Gil Pender observes, it has wonders in every street one turns down that are always fresh, always stimulating; or words to that effect!  And Allen makes full use of the camera to capture glimpses of such in the opening few minutes as we traverse the streets and boulevards taking in all of the well-known sights and tourist spots before encountering our hero and his intended, Inez (Rachel McAdams),demonstrating in the first few seconds of dialogue why they're future is so obviously not together:  hes an unrepentant romantic; shes an unrepentant materialist.  This view is swiftly supported when we meet her odious parents played to perfection by Mimi Kennedy and Kurt Fuller.

Gil is a frustrated novelist trapped within the creative constraints of being a well-paid Hollywood script writer so that he can support his well-heeled fianc in the manner to which shes become accustomed.  His sense of frustration increases by simply being in The City of Light, enveloped by the sense of other times, particularly, the Paris of the twenties, during which such eminent cultural American ex-pats such as Gertrude Stein, Scott-Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway moved.  This sense is given seeming physical reality when, preferring to walk home after a night out with his fianc and her particularly boorish ex-lecturer/friend, Paul (Michael Sheen), Gil encounters the twentieth Century equivalent of Cinderellas coach, which sweeps him off into the magical world of his fantasies where he meets and is befriended by all of his cultural ex-pat heroes in a soiree at Steins apartment.  Almost needless to say, this has serious implications for his impending nuptials.

Its all a bit too obviously contrived from the increasingly irritating accordion-based soundtrack to the increasingly clichd postcard depictions of Paris and the audience cannot help but be aware of how the script seeks to manipulate the viewer to ascribe to the view that the fianc and her parents are philistines that need to be dumped by the always affable Wilson.  This is conveniently reinforced by the equally odious Sheen by whom Inez is bafflingly enamoured.

Ultimately, its a harmless and pleasant enough travelogue through space-time: Wilson does his best to impersonate a more youthful Woody, Paris is green and lovely and we all get to agree about the cosily correct decisions Gil makes in trying to sort out his future.

Its not one of Woodys best and if you want a bit more invention in the same geographical location try or go back to Amelie!",1394928000,,2604,5.132387706855792

This film is a rarity in today's cinema. It has everything one can hope for: beautiful cinematography, inspired performances by all actors, and above all - a wonderful story. Young couple goes to Paris, and fun stuff happens... (it helps if you are the type who knows a little bit of Paris and its history, film, literature and so on). I will not disclose what happens, because you have to see it for yourself. From wonderful dialogues to hilarious scenes, it is a film-lovers feast, especially if you pay attention to detail.

IMO he ruins the enjoyment of the movie, because he is just that bad...from his whiny voice to his inability to play a serious role.

Set in the most storied city in the world, Owen Wilson is a dead ringer for a younger Woody Allen, with all of the schtick that accompanies the latter. The story is fun and whimsical, the soundtrack is a perfect complement, and the movie is a virtual travelogue of Paris. One of my favorite movies of recent years.",1390089600,,512,4.446808510638298

4840995,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight in Paris, is a story with a timeless message.

We can be happy wherever we are. Life is what we make of it, right here and right now. Seeking happiness in other places (and in the case of the main character in this story: other eras) never really lasts. But what a fun trip it was to go on, watching this story unfold.

Visually, this movie is such a treat. The beauty of Paris portrayed in the present and from the perspective of the 1920's is breathtaking. There is a dreamy quality to this film throughout.

Loved the costumes and the mesmerizing musical score too. My kind of music....classical jazz and Cole Porter, play on!

Life is but a dream for the lead character Gil (Owen Wilson). Night after night... wishes granted. Visiting legendary haunts with some of his literary idols from the past, Gil is transported to another time and place. And a place in time that he doesn't really want to come back from to face the problems in his own 21st century life including a fiancee and in-laws that leave much to be desired.

There is also a sadness to this story. Not just the voice but also the heart and soul of Woody Allen come through the main character's thoughts and words. It is obvious that there are personal memories woven into many scenes of this film. Maybe some ""could have beens"" and perhaps regrets for him too. It made the movie even more memorable and touching for me. I teared up a time or two watching and considering Woody Allen's mindset as the final cut rolled.

The only negative for me. Some of the acting was a bit ""stilted"" for lack of a better word when it came to present-day interactions between Owen Wilson and his fiancee in the movie Rachel McAdams. I found some of the dialogue and interaction between these two characters a bit over the top at times, tedious...I was always happy when the story slipped back into the world of the 1920's and Gil's vivid imagination.

This is an escape and ""feel good"" movie of the very best kind. I could imagine seeing this movie in a big old theatre. The kind that still has chandeliers, velvet seats and heavy drapes on the stage. For a matinee performance, even better. Stopping in for a break from a busy city street and day. That would really enhance the experience. It's just that kind of film.

Owen Wilson is mis-cast as a pale imitation of Allen as he stumbles through his lines, and Rachel McAdams, who can't act her way out of a paper bag, attempts to play an absolutely hateful girlfriend. ( Why is it that these bleach-blond fashion models who are mis-categorized as ""actresses"" only approach believability when they portray bitchy partners? They must be from Seattle ).
  At any rate, the two greatest characters in this movie never speak a line: Woody Allen, whose writing is wonderful but has never found young actors to live up to his genius; and the city of Paris. Watch the movie for those two reasons, and ignore the stumbling acting and bad diction of its stars.",1388448000,,798,4.692857142857143

Woody Allen does a great job contrasting, yet balancing, the awkwardness of Gil's writer persona with the more dramatic and austere characteristics 1930's Paris. Ultimately, it is the journey that Gil takes that sells this movie, as Wilson plays him well enough to make you care about his journey.

He directs this film, but he has a way of having his actors sound and act just like him! This is no exception. Owen Wilson plays a rather brow-beaten fiancee to a spoiled, domineering, pseudo-intellectual woman who is more than self-centered. The usual ideas of living better in a different time, with no time being the best, is a theme her that helps Wilson's character find true love in another century, but most importantly, in the present. Allen's themes of class differences and shallow self-indulgent people are clear. Wilson is a would be writer who wants desperately to finish a book, or anything for that matter. But this desire is not shared by his fiancee nor her parents. A little bit of politics is thrown in just for the heck of it; and of course, there is the music that is so Woody Allen. From fantasy, to reality, to fantasy and back to reality again, the people of the past help this frustrated writer to find and keep himself.

Those more literate viewers will appreciate the references and wit from characters including Ernest Hemingway, Dal&iacute;, and Bu&ntilde;uel, among others who populate this piece. Owen Wilson rises above to embody the essential Allen angst in ways I never thought possible. Wilson delivers a performance that I can't imagine anyone else giving. Essentially, the plot revolves around Wilson and his fianc&eacute; in Paris, tagging along with her parents who are on a business trip, and weird things ensue when Wilson's character takes a ride into the past to meet his literary heroes. Although Wilson's character is successful at writing screenplays, he's struggling with a novel. He learns life lessons in various visits to the past where he encounters the aforementioned literary and artistic giants, all of whom have something to say in outrageously entertaining fashion. Furthermore, the ""look"" of this film is pure eye candy, a saturated glow to the past and a crisp look at the present will resonate after many viewings.

4841046,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This movie is the story of Gil (Owen Wilson), a bored screenwriter living in California in a state of unrest about the possibility that he could become a distinguished novelist.  He simultaneously has become aware of the many writers and artists who have established their style and credibility during stays in Paris.  Dreaming of doing the same, he falls in love with Paris and with the idea that he must see Paris in the rain.  Eventually, he convinces his attractive but skeptical fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) that he must go there with her and make a highly focused effort to become an established novelist.  They arrive and soon her Father (Kurt Fuller) and mother (Mimi Kennedy) arrive on one of her father's business trips.  During a dinner in Paris scheduled for sensitive, open-minded and creative Gil and her parents to get to know each other, it becomes obvious that her wealthy, conservative and fixed-belief parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy) clash with Gil on almost every topic that comes up.  Early on, the most sensitive viewers are almost sure to notice that in some ways, Inez is like her parents and might not be an ideal match for Gil.  After getting settled in Paris, Inez encounters friends Paul (Michael Sheen), a pedantic know-it-all who talks almost continually and Carol (Nina Arianda).  Paul and Carol invite Gil and Inez to go dancing.  Inez accepts but Gil declines.  He wants to walk the streets of Paris at night to start soaking up the atmosphere he thinks might help him find himself as a distinguished novelist.  As a Paris clock loudly chimes the hour of midnight, a large and ancient taxi drives up to Gil and an animated and happy group of drinkers invite him inside.  The taxi drops Gil and his new friends at a lively party where he realizes he has passed through a time warp and is in the presence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and many other celebrities alive and well in the 1920s.  Gil revels in his good fortune and thinks the 1920s is the golden era he would most want to live in.  He meets and falls in love with the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who has just broken up with Pablo Picasso.  Just when Gil decides his relationship with Inez must end and begins gushing to Adriana about his love for her and the need to be together forever, Gil and Adriana slip into a second time warp, leading to their meeting a whole new batch of celebrities of the late 1800s such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas.  This second time warp experience impresses Adriana and causes her to tell Gil she cannot stay with him in the 1920s because the late 1800s was the true golden age.  During daylight the next day when Gil realizes his relationships with both Inez and Adriana are over he has a sudden flash of insight telling him that there is no golden era worth striving to enter.  We live in the era into which we are born and should make the most of it.  While walking the streets of Paris in a daze about how to proceed, he unexpectedly encounters Gabrielle, a level-headed, smiling and attractive female shopkeeper he had purchased Cole Porter records from earlier.  They walk together tuned to the same mental wavelength and the viewers are led to believe they would make a wonderful couple.  This is a delightful, full of fancy, warm-hearted and funny movie.  It is among the best work Woody Allen has offered to the thinking world.",1383868800,2,3400,4.669463087248322

The nice thing about Midnight in Paris is that there's something here for everyone...romance, mystery, comedy, a pinch of sci-fi fantasy...you just can't go wrong!  It is stunningly beautiful in its cinematography, score, and standout performances by everyone in the cast.  Woody said that Owen Wilson was the one and only person for the lead character, and I wholeheartedly agree.  This is, without a doubt, Owen's best role in any film, because it shows his remarkable range.

The music accompaniment is great and really suits the mood, and the way Gill is pulled into the time warp of 20s Paris is well done and enchanting.  The movie is perfectly cast with all the actors really seeming like the artists they play.  The modern day part of the story is funny and a good foil for the sidestory after midnight.

I found myself more interested in pursuing some of the classics after seeing this movie which personalized the artists and authors.  The movie is so much more than just casual entertainment because it adds depth to our lives.  It begs us to think back to times we might like to have lived, and people we might have known then, and not just the good parts but the bad parts as well.  I consider it a real gift to those who yearn for the 'good old days' whenever one thinks they might have been.

4841075,5,B005MYEQ4U,"'Midnight In Paris' is one of my favourite films from the woodster, a surprise late period box office smash, and even non woody people may well enjoy it. It is a film that emanates charm, one of the most perfectly cast films I've ever seen, with multiple cameos all integrated extremely well performing one of Woody Allen's best scripts ( it won the oscar i think).

Woody doesn't try to say too much in terms of big questions and that is absolutely fine by me. When he gets it right in terms of the comedy as he does here it has me coming back for multiple watches. He will go down as a comic genius first in terms of reputation, I believe, and an excellent filmmaker second. He has made some decent films in recent years where the comedy has taken a back seat: 'Match Point', 'Cassandra's Dream', 'Blue Jasmine'. I don't have the same urge to rewatch those ones although I do rate them. The ones I would rate as his absolute artistic best overall are as below with the feel good 'Midnight In Paris' being a comeback of sorts:

Husbands And Wives

We both love Paris, and Paris is a major character in this film. The first 6-8 minutes sums up our love affair with Paris. It's a fun, offbeat romantic comedy with a sweet ending.

I normally an only watch a movie twice as there's too much out there I want to experience and most movies aren't worth the time.  I've probably seen this movie 6 times and my husband over 15.

Wilson and McAdams helm a wonderfully talented cast that includes Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, David Lowe, and Marion Cotillard.  These fine actors and more bring to live such historical figures as  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and Pablo Picasso.  Woody Allen made no bad choices as he brought this project together, giving me both a sense of nostalgia and a desire to see Paris...perhaps in the rain, though I'd have to check what my girlfriend thinks of that last part.

Especially HERE with Paris in its daylight glory but in the subtleties of night and rain and clouds.  I also love Paris in the rain... even the ""touristy"" areas because there are so many museums, galleries, cafes, restaurants and shops to seek refuge in.  The flea markets (where the film ventures briefly) are many times covered now (similar to shops) and time spent there is priceless.  The cobblestones are shiny in the rain and everything smells delicious.  You can almost smell it on the screen as seen in ""Midnight"".  The ""time travel"" episodes are perfect with the casting being one of the most ingenious I've ever seen.  Brody as Dali!!  Right on!  I saw Dali on French television in the '70's when I lived in France and, however briefly, Adrien nailed him!  Kathy Bates as Stein also was just perfect... oh they all were.  I had never seen Owen before so I loved him as the ""surrogate"" Woody and, of course, Marion Cotillard once again turns in a charming performance... as does the First Lady of France.

4841108,5,B005MYEQ4U,"A wonderful movie. It bends time and space.  We meet historical figures and they come across as real people.

What a concept. An author trying to get a manuscript into a good enough version to send it to a publisher. Skepticism among those close to him. . . . Somehow, Gil (the author who has been a screenwriter in his prior professional life) comes into contact--in the evening and in the past--with characters like Ernest Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Picasso, Dahli, and Gertrude Stein. He also runs into a woman who captures his interest--although he is scheduled to marry another woman.

Stein works with him on his work; Gil also grows and becomes his own person.

The time travel element should NOT work--but it does.

I loved it and thought it was the most creative work Woody Allen has ever done (and I have seen all of his movies).

This is one of those films if you connect to it emotionally and  graphically you can watch it over and over again (not too often)and it will always have the same effect:great entertainment!! The storyline is fun, the cinematography great including the lighting, and the plot development good. Most of all it is FUNNY and CLEVER!  With every joke, every nuance you once again recall why Woody Allen was and is so funny. This is great escapism and really the brilliant theme of the movie:""that each generation thinks the previous generation had it easier"" is so simple but once again Allen had the genius to interpret this for us and bring it to life in a very well done and entertaining movie.",1371168000,2,846,4.70945945945946

Who can't relate to a romanticized notion of where you aren't? The characters you run into include F Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, etc etc. Not to mention you get Marion Cotillard being as charming as ever.

The Paris Visitors Bureau could have easily underwritten this movie, because they visit so many famous sights around town!

Paris is for dreamers.  Paris is for thinkers.  Paris is for artists.  Paris is for walkers. Paris is for Photographers.  Woody Allen captures all these elements into this pleasant story told through visiting American's eyes.  Woody shows us the Paris we wish we could experience without any of the grit of actual life.

4841162,5,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight In Paris"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Gil and Inez travel to Paris as a tag-along vacation on her parents' business trip. Gil is a successful Hollywood writer but is struggling on his first novel. He falls in love with the city and thinks they should move there after they get married, but Inez does not share his romantic notions of the city or the idea that the 1920s was the golden age. When Inez goes off dancing with her friends, Gil takes a walk at midnight and discovers what could be the ultimate source of inspiration for writing. Gil's daily walks at midnight in Paris could take him closer to the heart of the city but further from the woman he's about to marry.

The cast led by Owen Wilson (as Gil) & Rachel McAdams (as Inez) is excellent. The directing, the story and screenplay by Woody Allen is brilliant.

The cinematography by Darius Khondji is excellent. The film editing by Alisa Lepselter is excellent. The casting by Juliet Taylor is excellent. The production design & art direction by Anne Seibel is excellent. The set decoration by Helene Dubreuil is excellent. The costume design by Sonia Grande is excellent.

This is a brilliant film that is well-made and well-written. This is also well-crafted, well-executed and entertaining. This is a film that is different from most or all the films that have been made or have come out this year, so far. This is one of Woody Allen's best films, if not, his best film of his career. This is also one of the best films of the year and of the summer.",1369526400,,1539,4.548736462093863

It is hard to imagine Owen Wilson as a young Woody neurotic type, but he is sublime. A perfect blend of innocence and mischief. He is also able to deliver on the witty ""Allenesque"" male fantasies, in this case played out by 3 very different women. It is the past, the present and the future. It is Paris in the Belle Epoque, the Jazz age and a city that remains a timeless beauty even into the iPhone era. Paris itself is the star, and its senses delight. You will feel like you are at the party with the Fitzgeralds, sipping the wine, eating the food, viewing the art, and having Cole Porter play the piano.

In fact when you write or you paint or create whatever the nostalgia shop is truly necessary but even when you go somewhere all the past that you deeply love emerges without thinking.

4841193,5,B005MYEQ4U,MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is a wonderful film full of humor and beautiful directing by an american master. The first two minutes of the film are a series of shots of Paris with a Sidney Bichet song playing in the background. It reminded me of how much I love Paris and Allen is clearly paying homage to this wonderful city. Owen Wilson is great as the hopeless romantic who has visions of Paris in 1920's. He loves Paris in the rain and he clearly is not on the same page as his girlfriend who does not understand his obsession with the city. I relate to this because my wife and I have the same relationship dynamic. I am the passionate one who finds joy in every aspect of life.

4841199,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I am not a fan of Woody Allen as an actor, but always admired his creativity. This film is a perfect example of that. He wrote and directed the movie and it is absolutely fascinating if you're interested in the arts and times of the 1920s. The protagonist (played by Owen Wilson), a successful Hollywood screen writer working on his first novel, is visiting Paris with his fiancee and her parents. One night his fiancee goes dancing with a couple they knew from back in California, but he doesn't want to go and chooses to walk back to the hotel alone. He gets lost in the streets of Paris. As the clock strikes midnight, a 1920's car drives up, stops, the people in the car convince him to join them, he gets in, and is driven into the past - the era that he feels is the Golden Age (the 1920s in Paris). He returns to the same place night after night and each night is driven back to the past where he meets the notables who lived during that time - artist, authors, sculptors, like Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Man Ray, Cole Porter, etc. Gertrude Stein critiques his novel; he is part of the inner circle. He meets a beautiful woman, a fashion designer, who has had affairs with Modigliani and other famous artists, presently with Picasso, and he falls in love with her. I won't go on because to do so I'd have to divulge how it all ends and I definitely do not want to do that. If you know anything about the arts of the 1920s, every time the protagonist meets someone else my guess is that you'll say ""Oh, my God"" more than once because the actors portraying those characters are so spot-on with their characterizations - at least from what I have read about them. The Hemingway character, for instance, is exactly what I imagine Ernest Hemingway would have been like at the time his first novel was published. So, if you're interested in seeing the notables from the past brought to life in the present, this is the movie for you.",1364947200,,1948,4.428969359331476

4841213,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Pros: Woody Allen's famously witty and neurotic tendencies are made more human and approachable by Owen Wilson, whose Gil is a very familiar character to the ones he's played in the past and strikes me as a good stepping stone into the world of Allen. I really appreciate the fact that this movie is a statement on this year's Academy Awards, where only one nominee for best picture is firmly grounded in the present. Allen really couldn't have picked a better year to make this into an Academy-worthy film, as its overarching theme serves to incredulously point out the irony of its inclusion in the nominees this year in particular.

Cons: As much as I can appreciate most of Gil's personality, I just can't relate to his unabashed love of the city of Paris. Since I've never been there, I will admit that this might have to do with my deep-seated reactionary attitude toward all things French. But honestly, what's so great about every street, building, sign, and cobblestone in that city? Also, pretty much every character in this movie not named Gil could stand to receive a hearty punch in the face. I probably wouldn't have fared very well in the 1920s, listening to speech patterns like that all the time. Speaking of the 1920s, I felt like I could have stood to know a bit more about that generation of writers, musicians, and artists to really appreciate a good deal of the portrayals and references littered throughout the movie. Although if Hemingway reads like he spoke in this, I'm glad I haven't read his books after all.

Overall: I won't say I disliked watching the movie, and there were a number of moments that made me actually laugh out loud (something I'm not typically won't to do alone in a dark room). However, I spent most of the movie wondering if it would arrive at an eventual point and whether I would care. Ultimately it did wind up with a theme that I believe ought to be quite strenuously stressed with some people, but it wasn't enough to make me think of it as anything other than a ""cute"" film that really only garners a best picture mention due to this particular year's crop of nominees. After some wrestling with an eight rating, I eventually settled on a 7 out of 10.",1362873600,,2206,4.596446700507614

4841215,2,B005MYEQ4U,"I love this movie and I'm so glad to have it. However, it was listed as the original film and instead it is definitely a boot-legged copy of it.

Also, the DVD itself jumps right to a menu screen with few options- meaning there were no previews, nothing to state that the producers weren't held liable to commentary... and I'm pretty sure there is no commentary option.

Anyway, this is definitely a favorite and I bought it. First, Paris is absolutely gorgeous in this film.. romantic, beautiful, dazzling, mysterious, a brilliant city....second, the cast, as in every Allen film is great. He picks not only the most beautiful, interesting women, but the most interesting and talented and attractive men...the ones who are new to celebrity, and those who have been around a while..Owen Wilson is always enjoyable to watch and especially so in this film in which he plays the Woody Allen character, a writer with a huge imagination about to be married to a woman who doesn't get him at all. That plays out in a fairly predictable way and that's fine.
What I enjoyed so much about the film is the imaginative, sort of science fiction aspect, and how Allen brings the great writers and artists of the 20s to life, including Gay Paree. (Gay in the sense of wildly fun and creative, anything goes gay)...Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Bunel and other luminaries come to life and through the strange series of events and meetings with them the Owen Wilson character learns a lesson, and we get it, too, about people and any particular time in history. The story ends well...as always the music is sublime and if you are a Woody Allen fan, and like brilliant, charming movies, you'll enjoy the heck out of this one.",1362441600,,1561,4.742647058823529

4841235,5,B005MYEQ4U,"My respect and appreciation for Woody Allen as a director and screenwriter is fully restored after seeing this movie. It is a gem; one of his best. The protagonist, Gil Pender, is a screenwriter who is nostalgic about Paris and the Lost Generation of the 20s; and is writing his first novel, using Paris as an inspiration. He is engaged to Inez, and while they appear to be in love w/each other, their interests move in divergent directions. They meet up with Paul Bates and his wife; Paul being a self-appointed expert of all things French. Inez is attracted to him, but he is an insufferable know-it-all to Gil. Inez, Paul and his wife decide to go dancing one night, but Gil begs off and walks back to his hotel. Getting lost, he stops to rest and just after midnight, an antique auto with group of revelers in 20s garb, stops to pick him up. He is magically transported to the 20s and meets and befriends famous members of the Lost Generation, including the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso; etc...and Picasso's beautiful mistress at the time, Adriana. He is immediately attracted to Adriana and Stein agrees to review his novel. Inez and Gil, increasingly grow apart and Gil becomes increasingly attracted to his real, but ultimately fantasy world of the 20s...and he is falling in love with Adriana. That will set the stage nicely; if you are intrigued so far, watch this fine movie and see how it plays out. look for exceptionally fine performances by Owen Wilson as Gil; Rachel McAdams, as Inez; Michael Sheen as the insufferable Paul Bates. Among the Lost Generation, Marion Cotillard delivers her usual fine performance as Adriana and Kathy Bates and Corey Stoll are standouts as Stein and Hemingway. Also look for Carla Bruni as the museum guide and Lea Seydoux, a nostalgia dealer that Gil befriends.

Woody Allen must have had that fantasy, too, and he has the means to at least put it onto celluloid, so that he can share it with us. The story line is lighthearted, and that is a good thing. After all, fantasy travel is not real! In this story, our hero tackles more than one issue: his personal life (should he or should he not marry his rich-Daddy girlfriend?), his professional life (should he remain a fast-writing Hollywood slave or become a serious author?) his life style (Malibu Beach or Paris?)...
and luckily for him, the time-travel fairies smile upon him, allowing him to slip into the 20s, and meet now famous people, whom he admires, in person, helping him reflect on the goals in his life and solve his conundrums.
I can assure you, if I had a chance to meet Picasso, Monet, Rodin, Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway up close and personal, I'd be gone in a heartbeat! All these celebrities and some more are portrayed very nicely, and the photography of Paris most beautiful sites and sights is extraordinary. Woody has a master's eye for that!

The story is not a conventional one, like all Woody Allen movies, but I would not like to reveal the story, because it will spoil all the fun in watching this wonderful movie.

The same love affair with the city (and country) - right down to the favorite era of the main character! (I, too, love the 20's and 30's)  It was as if Woody Allen consulted me on the story line, then changed the main character to male.  I love this movie... and I love Paris. The opening scenes that show some of the most famous places brought back so many happy memories and I could sit there and say ""I've been there!""  It totally changes your perspective.

4841250,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's latest film is a beautiful and amusing homage to Paris in the 1920s. It follows Gil (Owen Wilson) and his fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) on their holiday in Paris. Both Wilson and McAdams played their parts fantastically: McAdams plays a beautiful and spoilt, all-American blonde who is exasperated by Gil's romantic and fantastical musings and Wilson plays a whimsical Hollywood script writer,who is desperate to escape America and move to Paris to become a successful novelist.

Wilson plays the Woody Allen protagonist wonderfully, capturing Allen's signature neurotic intelligence without becoming a cheap imitation of his acting. From the outset is it obvious the two characters are a mismatch and Gil soon leaves Inez' company to go on solitary late-night walks through Paris. As the clock strikes midnight, a vintage car pulls up and he is transported back to his favourite era, the 1920s. He meets all the major artists of the period: the Fitzgerald's have fantastic energy and Allen's depictions of Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali are hilarious.

I loved the lavish and indulgent, nostalgic celebration of the 1920's complete with jazz music, beautiful dresses and wild partying. Marion Cottilard, the 'art-groupy', loved by Hemingway and Picasso is beautiful and captivating, perfectly suited to the glamour of the 1920s. The shots of the cobbled streets of Paris in the dusky street-lit darkness are stunning: the film is a touching and beautiful musing on time, nostalgia and love and you cannot help but follow in Gil's footsteps and fall in love with the city in this beautiful and inspiring film.",1359244800,,1626,5.226053639846743

Allen captures the nostalgic feel of Paris perfectly. And I know that no explanation is given for time travel and that Inez's (Gil's fiance) family and ex are practically caricatures, but the movie is a bit surrealistic and that just adds to the overall experience. Also despite all the nostalgia in this film, it doesn't end on a sour note but rather a hopeful one. Just a wonderful movie, one of my top 10.",1359072000,,581,4.542857142857143
4841255,5,B005MYEQ4U,If you've ever been to Paris you have to see this.  Movie is great fun (Owen Wilson is the new Woody Allen) but the photography of Paris makes it worth owning this movie.,1359072000,,170,4.151515151515151
4841256,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Many people have been to Paris who have had their romantic notions of the city completely deflated. I have not been to Paris, nor have I ever felt this overwhelming sense of grandeur. Don't get me wrong, I would like to visit it one day. There's too much history, food, and shopping to be done. But what struck me about this movie was that it is Woody Allen's love letter to the city.

I'll leave a synopsis to others. Just know that this film unfolds very (super)naturally, in that it is true to its characters. If I had one complaint, it may be that we needed one more scene between Owen Wilson and Lea Seydoux. Other than that, every creative decision serves the film; in a word, it's cinematic magic.

If I ever love anything as much as Woody Allen loves Paris, I'd be the Paula Deen to its butter. Seriously, though, I was completely on the side of Owen Wilson's character. You could just feel his awe and wonder as the film unfolded. Perhaps this is due to the screenplay along with Wilson's performance; is this Wilson's career best?

Suddenly, ""Paris, je t'aime"" makes much more sense.",1358899200,,1093,4.51010101010101

4841258,4,B005MYEQ4U,"This review contains some spoilers:

What I liked about the movie:

1) This really is a ""feel good movie,"" and I would probably watch it again. It has a happy ending.
2) I enjoyed the time travel aspect of it, especially the era of the past on which it focused (the 1920s----love the music, fashion, etc.)
3) Despite how cliche and unrealistic it was (see #1 in the next list), I liked the scenery. The scenery fulfills most Americans' romantic ideas of what Paris should look/be like.
4) I enjoyed laughing at Paul, the pedantic character. (Don't we all know somebody like him?).  The scene where he argues with the tour guide is priceless!
5) I liked the art/literary allusions; watching this felt kind of like a movie version of Jeopardy where I kept trying to identify the characters and allusions.

The film's problems:

1) The film is rife with cliches:  From the protagonists' obsession with walking in the rain to the overly romanticized portrayal of Paris to the in-your-face personalities of some of the famous writers & artists, parts of the movie lacked originality. (Perhaps Allen was trying to portray Paris in the overly romanticized way that Gil sees it??).

2) The conspicuous yet confusing treatment of the theme. We are almost hit over the head with the movie's ""message"" toward the end. However, the epiphany Gil has about overly romanticizing the past is confusing as ""the"" theme for the movie since the pedantic character expresses the same view and we're meant to think he's a jerk.  So is Allen trying to say that we tend to romanticize the past and shouldn't or not?

3) The caricature-like portrayal of the bratty fiance and her conservative Republican parents (of course, being Hollywood, it's almost a given that the bad guys will be Republicans/conservatives).  This, like the theme, could have been handled with a defter hand. Because of how superficial Inez was, I found it hard to believe that she and Gil would ever have gotten engaged. That made the entire basis of them being in Paris unrealistic for me.

I think all the actors did a good job.  I disagree with some reviewers who believe Wilson's performance was dry. I think he did a nice job. Clearly, Wilson is playing the typical type of guy that Allen himself always plays in his movies (somewhat confused, trying to make sense of his life).  Since Allen is too old for the part, he cast Wilson.

Overall, I think this movie is worth watching.",1358812800,,2434,4.750593824228028

The music alone is enough to love this movie, but Owen Wilson is just an absolute perfect cast as Gil, the writer who yearns for another time, another place.  This movie is visually appealing and if you have any knowledge of writers, you will enjoy the cameos of past writers throughout--Hemingway is my favorite, but I also love Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein and the guy from The Piano as Dali.

So many great lines throughout.  Yes, I have heard a couple friends of mine say ""it's kind of slow.""  Well, it is.  The opening scene of Paris is about 4 minutes of music and shots of Paris.

Also innocently funny, yet with plenty of messages to ponder, some subtle, others less so. I remained captivated for the duration of the film, as did my husband, kids and an elderly uncle. There was enthusiastic applause at the end of the film from everyone.  No dull moments at all in this picture, as your eyes move from one beautiful scene to the next.

The concept is sheer genius: a wannabe American writer (played by the marvelous Owen Wilson) finds himself in Paris with his fiancee, dreaming about the magic of the city and its mesmerizing impact on those American literary giants who graced its cobblestone streets in the first half of the 2oth century. Only he isn't really dreaming when midnight rolls around, or is he? There is Ernest Hemmingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and a host of other characters who pop in and out each scene, giving you (and the film's protagonist) a chance to experience the glories of the age. There is ample name dropping, and you have to pay attention to notice that, yes indeed, yet another influential figure has made a cameo appearance...

4841339,3,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight In Paris"" (2011) directed by Woody Allen at age 76!

The following are comments about ""Midnight In Paris"" (2011) and also (at the end of the comments) a brief memory of a time I met Woody Allen personally.... from Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

--------------------

The ""Midnight In Paris"" (2011) movie is OK and interesting many ways....movie making is very hard work, and Woody obviously went easy on himself and the actors part of th movie....took a lot of short-cuts....how to make movies at age 76 and not die from overwork, it appears!

The main character gets into a time warp and goes back to both the 1920's and the 1890's and talks with celebrities in Paris during those two periods...quite a WHO'S WHO laundry list of famous people...maybe 2 dozen of them.

Nice photography of present day Paris, too, which is very clean, clean, clean and so scrubbed is lacks charm in contrast to older movie depictions of Paris when it's charming (AMERICAN IN Paris [1951], etc.).

The actors improvise a lot, and Woody's script has about 3 very good short sections with memorable writing, etc.

The movie is no classic, but not bad, either. Young Owen Wilson has the lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his own movies.

Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in 2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who had a stroke...and his speech isn't clear at times......but...he keeps on going like old man river.

He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith, I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz band...called ""Michael's Pub"" as I remember. I was living in Manhattan then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it. He talked about the Mets baseball team.

Woody is very important...made 41 films since TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN in 1968...... Woody made that movie in SF CALIF on almost no money!

He, his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams), and his in-laws are visiting Paris. While the others prefer to shop and visit museums, Pender is enchanted with exploring the city on foot. One night, Pender loses his way and is transported to a different era where he meets famed writers and artists of Paris's ""Golden Age."" On his journeys to the past, he learns many life lessons and finally finds the inspiration he'd been looking for all along.

While Owen Wilson can be hit-or-miss for me, I found him to be unexpectedly brilliant in this role. I liked how his time traveling expeditions were completely unexplained (and not written off to daydreams or fantasies). The crux of the story lies in his meetings with writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and artists like Picasso. At the same time you don't have to be extremely knowledgeable about all of these historical figures to appreciate the film- simply the idea of being in an age of heightened creativity, in a European city, is well played out on the screen.

Woody Allen does a marvelous job of presenting a romantic Paris to the viewer in the time allowed. The story is a fantasy romance that shows Paris at its best and introduces an unexpected plot twist that caught us both by surprise.

No effort is made to explain the major fantasy component but no explanation is wanted or needed as the viewer enjoys a fanciful adventure that can only happen in Paris at midnight.

The characters are great and the acting is spot on.  Hemingway is a riot, depicted in much the same way that I always considered he might have been.  The Surrealists are just too much fun and Kathy Bates' take on Gertrude Stein is great.  Sure, you have to buy into the entire time travel concept but it is a fantasy after all, not a non-fiction piece.  Owen Wilson does a fine job as the ""Hollywood hack"" searching for meaning in his time by exploring the Paris of the 1920's.  Rachel McAdams is just perfect as his self-centered, very American fiance. And we all know a guy just like the ""pedantic one"", don't we?
The shots of Paris leave little doubt that Woody is in love with the place, if you have ever been there you will understand and recognize many of the locations.  The cinematography is lovely and gives the film a nice, warm feeling.  The score is a fine mix of Cole Porter songs and Parisienne jazz.

4841359,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I love Woody Allen.  He painted such beautiful scenes, in warm hues to tell a story about romance.  He hits the notion directly that
the romantic life always seems to have been in another era, not the one we live in.  From the colorful characters of the past to the music of Cole Porter, Paris comes alive at midnight.  The great part of this story is that it doesn't celebrate the French - it celebrates Americans in Paris ... from Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein ... it is our storytellers, our songwriters who make this movie what it is!  Bravo, Woody Allen - you made me thankful for THIS day to be the most romantic because I can watch your movie on demand, on a DVD, on a DVR, on an iPod, iPad or iPhone anytime I want!",1346803200,2,747,4.307142857142857
4841360,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Like the man at the movie`s core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen`s universally acclaimed ""Midnight in Paris.""  What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.

The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.

So far, so good.  Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often won't to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today.  For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite.  He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she`s picked to marry.  No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.

The main problem for me with ""Midnight in Paris"" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life.  In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last.  They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd.  Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works.  And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.

The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better.  Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie.  Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.

So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film?  Surely, those are worth the price of admission.  Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.

So what is good about the film?  Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque.  And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into ""The Exterminating Angel.""  The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.

More virtues like these and ""Midnight in Paris"" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.",1346371200,,3707,4.766823161189358
4841361,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Truth be told, I discovered this movie looking at the list of movies that Tom Hiddleston is in. However, I did not watch this movie just because he was in it. The concept of someone idolizing a different time period wishing that they could have lived then is a fascinating idea. The conclusion that the main character comes to is a decent one, but there seems to always be an air of hopelessness to it.

On a side note, there is absolutely no reason that this movie had to be PG-13. They could have made this so much cleaner without compromising storyline or tone.  And I am not talking about the smoking. Why, seriously why?",1346025600,,625,4.426086956521739

It was nice to see Owen Wilson as the clueless, lost, hopeful main character, even though I do enjoy his signature cocky characters as well. Rachel McAdams is so deliciously mean in this movie! Not the sweet, girl-next-door character that she more frequently plays. Marion Cotillard is lovely as always, and Adrien Brody as the rhino-obsessed Salvador Dali is hilarious.

You might not like it if you're a fancy, snobby amateur film critic, but check it out if you're a simple-minded commoner like myself who enjoys colorful movies with quirky characters, good music, and an interesting plot.",1345680000,2,769,4.953488372093023

Woody Allen should stop churning out a movie a year.  He should instead focus on making great films as they come to him.  The new yearly, European excursion to be inflicted upon audiences is Midnight in Paris.  A man of the twenty-first century longs for the golden years of Paris in the 1920s.  The rain, the city, and the writers and artists are just too good to not want to join.  And Gil gets his wish, every night at midnight.

The whimsical story of a time travel is rather funny and cute.  The Fitzgeralds, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and so many others offer a fanciful cast of characters for Gil to interact with and react to.  In fact, the best the film has to offer is Gil's boyish wonderment and fascination with everything going on.  Owen Wilson is superb.  His facial expressions are priceless.  It is a rather simple movie with a simple plot, but the magic of Gil's travels back in time and his child-like wonderment is a treat.  Adrian Brody is hilarious as Dali, he really steals the scene.

The acting for the rest of the cast seems heavy-handed.  Inez is annoying; painfully so.  Her parents and friends are so pretentious it's difficult to watch them.  It's almost as if Allen is writing and directing for audiences he thinks are too dense to get it.  Or he is writing about people that are just unbearable.

If you can suffer through the ""present day"" scenes, the golden age of Paris in the 1920s is good for a delightful laugh.",1345507200,,1994,5.909090909090909
4841365,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Paris looks beautiful.  I loved the over the top characterizations of Dali, Hemingway and all of the others...perfect.  Gil (Owen Wilson) reminds me of James Stewart (in the old ""classic"" movies).  He is always in the background, holding back, watching everything that's taking place but not saying what he thinks and seemingly unable to change the things that are going on around him.  He's a ""nice"" guy who has taken it a bit too far so that people dismiss him and take advantage of his good nature.  He is a writer who is in love with the past and in this film, his fantasy of visiting the past, actually comes true.  Once he slides down the rabbit hole, he is able to interact with his heroes, fall in love, and catch a glimpse of the old Paris with which he is so enamored.  Scott and Zelda are wonderful and the party filled world that Gil accidentally stumbles into is a feast for the eyes.  If you can overlook or laugh at the snobby, conceited, moronic people that surround Gil in his everyday life, you are in for a treat.  The music is pretty good as well.  The moral of the story is that no matter what period of time you actually live in, most people glamorize/romanticize a certain period of time in the past.  When Gil finally made it to his dream past he found that the people he admired so much were dissatisfied with their present and when he went back even farther, he found that those people were unhappy about their own time period and felt  that the Renaissance was the best time to have been alive.  We are too close to our own present...we can't see it...no matter how Gil tried to impress the importance of THEIR time on those around him, they couldn't understand what he was seeing/saying because they were too busy living it and writing/painting their world into existence.  I liked it.",1345420800,,1813,4.487804878048781
4841366,3,B005MYEQ4U,"I knew that not everything have to be convincible in a movie. But I do not feel Gil and Inez can be a couple and ready to marry. I do not believe that Adriana  can attract to Gil. It is strange that Gabrielle will walk with Gil in the rain in the final scene. Unless Woody Allen do not know what is love.

After watching the movie for 15 minutes I was in the verge of stopping the movie and switching to Yankee game. The motivation keeping me watching it is I like Marion Cotillard. She is so charming and her beauty is not comparable.

I will not steal my girlfriend or wife's jewellery for other woman's gift. The earring scene can be deleted. Gil purchased another rings. Adriana said she liked it even without taking a closer look.

Most of the actors and actress are superb so I give 3 stars othwise 2 stars is sufficient.",1345334400,,827,4.248407643312102

4841368,4,B005MYEQ4U,"MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, in some ways, reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode, ""The Trouble With Templeton,"" in which an aging stage actor, nostalgic for his youth, ends up traveling to his past. Like that episode, there are wistful elements that suffuse this film's narrative. Our rear view mirror tends to be rose-tinted, isn't it? Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) and his fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) are holidaying in Paris, sort of mooching off Inez's parents who are there on a business trip. Gil, a self-confessed hack scriptwriter who's raring to write his great American novel, is enamoured with La Ville-Lumire, the City of Light. On and on he goes regaling a couldn't care less Inez with anecdotes concerning the literary luminaries who populated Paris back in the day. Inez's eyes are gone all glazed. She'd rather go shopping. So, from jump, the dynamics of their relationship set off our uh-oh radar. And yet MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is touted partly as a frothy romantic comedy.

It's written and directed by Woody Allen, and you know what you're getting with that name brand. Clever words, a touch of satire, a slice of whimsy, and a neurosis or two. I hear Owen Wilson delivering his dialogue, his verbal tics and cadence, and I picture Woody Allen mouthing along those same lines. I didn't like Wilson's character initially; he seemed a little pushy and opinionated. But then along comes Gil's fiance's old crush, a gent who is so pedantic and know-it-all that Gil, next to him, immediately becomes more sympathetic. After one evening of wine tasting, Mr. Pedantic extends an invitation to Gil and Inez to step out and go dancing; Inez accepts and Gil declines. Gil instead opts for a midnight stroll. And when he gets lost and sits on the steps of that old church, along sidles an old classic Peugeot packed with revelers who wave Gil on over. A bemused Gil gets in the Peugeot and off they motor to the swinging 1920s.

No explanation at all for the time travel. Woody Allen expects us to just roll with it, and I was cool with that. In the dizzy era of jazz and flappers, a flabbergasted Gil bumps into one literary icon after another, from F. Scott Fitzgerald (and his wild wife Zelda) to Ernest Hemingway to Gertrude Stein (warmly played by Kathy Bates). And maybe the high point of Gil's evening takes place in Gertrude Stein's salon when she offers to proofread his manuscript.

Meanwhile, life in the present day keeps on keeping on. Except that now Gil's fiance and her parents have taken to wondering where Gil disappears to when evening swings around. The future pops-in-law even sics a private detective to shadow him (the gumshoe's eventual fate may elicit a grin). In the roaring '20s, after each midnight, Gil keeps running into famous and interesting folks (including Adrien Brody's entertainingly manic Salvador Dali). And, in the past, Gil meets the exquisite Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who once was mistress to Braque and Modigliani and is currently Picasso's lover. Surprisingly, sparks fly between her and Gil. And I did mention ""frothy romantic comedy,"" didn't I?

Every now and then a Woody Allen film muddles that line separating fantasy and reality. Two of my favorite Woody Allen films are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeper/dp/0792846117/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeper</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Purple-Rose-of-Cairo/dp/B00005O06L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Purple Rose of Cairo</a>, with MIDNIGHT IN PARIS perhaps elbowing in and inching up in my personal rankings. I love this premise; I love time travel. Paris looks exquisite, day or night. Woody Allen fabricates grace and wit and romance, not just of the heart but of an era. The ensemble cast is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is enchanting and luminous (but when is she not?). Owen Wilson's character exhibits such enthusiasm over the Who's Who of Paris circa 1920s that he becomes just irrepressible. Note that Woody isn't going for out-and-out authenticity with his depiction of the historical figures. He's having too good a time exaggerating a trait, tweaking a characteristic. I chuckled at Papa Hemingway's tendency to relate everything to one's masculinity and virility. I enjoyed Gil's befuddling of Luis Buuel. I will say that you'll get more out of this film if you're familiar with even a few of the larger than life personalities Gil meets in the past. But if you were in the dark with some of these folks - as I was, occasionally - well, I say this: to the wiki!

The acting is terrible, especially by a silly and totally unfunny clown Owen Wilson. All the characters are like cartoon pictures.

4841371,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Owen Wilson is in modern day Paris waxing poetic about the romance of the city to his unimpressed fiance Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls) while touring with an insufferable pedantic know-it-all. Owen Wilson writes popular but forgettable screenplays and wants to be a novelist like the generation of American writers that flocked to Paris in the 1920's, though no one is particularly interested in his ambitions.

  One night Owen Wilson abandons his group to take a walk in the streets of Paris and not surprisingly gets completely lost. He sits on a corner at midnight and gets picked up by a old fashioned car which takes him straight to a party in 1920's Paris. He comes face to face with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, though at first he insists in thinking that the entire party is an elaborate ruse. Although he comes to accept that the party is really happening and that these people are the writers and artists he admires, at dawn it once again seems impossible that any of it could have happened. But in the coming nights he catches the same car at midnight and meets Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, Gloria Stein, Matisse, and others, talking about their most famous ideas and even getting an assessment of his own writing. Owen Wilson falls hard for a 1920's woman who was Leo's wife in Inception. Meanwhile, in the present, his night time wanderings catch the malicious suspicions of Mean Girl's father, and Mean Girls drifts further from Owen Wilson and closer to pedantic know-it-all.

  As someone who grew up admiring the paintings of Dali and Picasso, and was so recently charmed by Fitzgerald, this movie was absolutely fantastic. The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was divine, the acting was over the top and hilarious. For example, Hemingway spoke like he was reading the most dramatic sections of his novels, which my sister referred to as 'Book-Speak', and his constant bravado had me applauding when he yelled, 'Who wants to fight!?' Fitzgerald was every inch the man I imagined and kept calling people 'Old Sport' like Gatsby did. I thought for a second Matisse was Freud but no such luck, it seemed to me a criminal missed opportunity not to feature Freud in a Woody Allen movie. At the end, the movie had a great twist leading to a solid revelation and message for the film, and it ends on a high note.

This was unfortunate for me (others may disagree and likely do) because my opinion of the modern era of literature and sometimes art in general is that a great deal of it was produced by people like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, who had their heads stuck so far up their own boozy bums, it was a wonder that they were able to emerge long enough to screw their lives up so completely. If I'd been Gil and had caught that first glimpse of Hemingway glowering and yapping on and on in his self-indulgent way in that tavern, I would have run screaming back to the 21st century, dumped the vile fiancee and her core-rotten family, and headed off into the rain with the nice girl.

Owen Wilson was wasted because he was merely a body-double for Woody Allen. The writing was childish- not even good at a fairy tale level- & the interesting people from the 1920's were basically foils for Woody's dream of being able to go back in time and suggest ideas to them that they then would be remembered for in the future.(or so the lead character could use his inside infomation from the past to win arguments in the present) Quite the fantasy and not a bad idea but poorly realized in this movie. I think this movie was made BY Woody Allen FOR Woody Allen & that too could be OK If the writing and acting were better. The opening is a love letter to Paris and it is beautiful & the first half of the movie was....... tolerable but then it became a repetetive waste of time. And a giant boring cliche. Yikes what a let down after having this movie recommended to me by some friends and reading all of the glorious reviews in entertainment magazines. Did they see the same movie??  Made me sad because I wanted to like this movie and I really really did not enjoy it. Neither did my husband. He came up with the ""annoyingly neurotic"" phrase. You expect some of that with almost any Woody project but this was over the top..........Owen WAS Woody as much as he could be &  he did a great job with the vocal inflections and hand mannerisms but the movie could have been so much better if he had been allowed to use his own persona or create a new one for his character.

4841387,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Many say ""Midnight in Paris"" is director Woody Allen's cinematic love letter to Paris. It certainly is, but the film is also a well-made bitter-sweet romantic comedy. What is most remarkable about it is the optimistic and relaxed feel of the entire film. As a movie, ""Midnight in Paris"" may lack the charms of ""Annie Hall"" or the insights of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" but Woody Allen's latest work is a delightful mixture of off-beat humor and wry self-awareness.

Owen Wilson plays Gil, an American who wants be a novelist, but whose current work is doing re-writes for Hollywood movies. While staying in Paris with his fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, Gil, who is writing a novel about a ""nostalgia shop,"" is given a chance to travel in time back to the 1920s, and meet the artists including Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), as well as Picasso's lover, beautiful and charming Adriana (Marion Cotillard).

What Gil eventually learns about his own vision of the glorified past is nothing new, though it makes an interesting contrast to the nostalgic tone seen here, and in the director's works in the past (""Radio Days"" for instance). Owen Wilson is perfectly cast as Allen's alter ego-like protagonist, through whose eye we see the streets of Paris and the city's legends. This is a charming comedy that is, if not profound, still humorous.",1341792000,2,1388,4.952789699570816

While in Paris on a midnight stroll at the stroke of midnight, a car shows up and takes him to a most extraordinary party, in attendance are The Fitzgeralds (Zelda and Scott) and Cole Porter who belts out tunes at the piano. Gil Pender is a screenwriter wannabe novelist who would rather live and work in an attic office in Paris than marry and move to Malibu like his snotty fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) would prefer and this party blows him away. Later he meets, (an amazing likeness of) Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, and Picasso. He also rubs elbows with Dali, who is magnificently played by Adrian Brody (my favorite part of the film) and many other artists and writers from the 1920s. Woody Allen has created a work of genius in this understated film.

As Gil's personal relationships grows with the greats of the past, he comes to some realizations of his present life. For a while he bounces back and forth between his current vacation in Paris and Paris in the Golden Age. This is really a neat film and if you enjoy stories of such as A Moveable Feast, you will really enjoy this lighthearted comedy.

I enjoyed all of the performances in the movie and found the cast to be amazing and the script first rate. This is a really charming movie and I haven't been that interested in Woody Allen's movies in the last ten years or fifteen years, but this one has the old magic. It's like Manhattan in the way that you can watch it more than once.",1341619200,4,1729,4.451104100946372
4841389,5,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight in Paris"" now ranks among my favorite Woody Allen films of all time...and that's saying a lot. First and foremost, the film is set entirely in Paris and is just beautiful to watch. Allen really captures all the best things about the city in this movie. Second, though, the story itself is a true delight. Owen Wilson stars as Hollywood screenwriter and aspiring novelist Gil Pender, who is visiting Paris with his obnoxious fiancee (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Gil is at kind of a crossroads, and he ends up wandering around Paris aimlessly in the middle of the night. He gets lost, and then he meets some colorful new friends who are right out of the Golden Age: we're talking Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein here, among others. Gil also meets a charming woman (Marion Cotillard) who makes him begin to question the choices he's made and determine what he wants out of life.

This is a beautiful and clever film full of witty references to classic art, literature, etc. It's also a great story about a man who really finds himself in the beautiful City of Lights. I really enjoyed ""Midnight in Paris"" and I highly recommend it.",1341532800,2,1163,4.729064039408867

4841392,5,B005MYEQ4U,"It had been nearly 25 years since I checked out a new Woody Allen film. I was a huge fan of his work in the late 60's and the 1970's but for the most part Woody kinda lost me after that. When ""Midnight in Paris"" was released about a year or so ago a friend call me raving about it.  He didn't tell me a whole lot about the film but assured me that I would love it.  So I took a day off and made it my business to check out this flick.  And  although there only about 10 people in the theater that June morning I wanted to stand up and cheer when they rolled the credits. For me ""Midnight In Paris"" was a sheer delight.  I knew from the get-go that this was a movie that I definitely wanted to own.

""Midnight In Paris"" stars Owen Wilson as aspiring novelist Gil Pender and Rachel McAdams as his lovely fiancee Inez. The couple are visiting ""The City of Light"" with Inez's parents. Gil and Inez seem very much in love as the film opens but cracks quickly begin to develop in the relationship. Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter who has simply become bored with his work and dreams of living and working in Paris the way the great artists and writers of the 1920's did. Inez has other ideas. She longs for the glamorous life in Malibu with all of the amenities. Inez is definitely going to be high maintenance. Gil feels at one with this place and wants to explore the streets of the city and savor the essence of Paris. Inez prefers to go off with friends and take in the art galleries and museums. They are slowly drifting apart. Gil's life would forever change one evening when at the stroke of midnight a limo pulls up alongside him and the occupants invite him to join them. Suddenly and remarkably Gil finds himself smack dab in the middle of the 1920's Paris he has always read and dreamed of. Furthermore he has the opportunity to meet and greet several of the legendary figures who were living in Paris at that time. That list would include writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T.S. Eliot, the legendary songwriter Cole Porter along with jazz great Josephine Baker and a group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Paul Gauguin. Gil desperately wants to show Inez what he has been experiencing but only he is allowed to enter into this bizarre netherworld. During his travels Gil also meets a ravishing young lady named Adriana (Marion Cotillard) with whom he has much in common. Here finally is a place where he feels fulfilled. Meanwhile, as you might expect all of these improbable events do not bode well for the future of Gil and Inez's relationship.

I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoyed ""Midnight In Paris"". The views of Paris both during the day and at night were nothing short of stunning.  The photography alone makes this film worth owning.  Furthermore, in the finest tradition of Woody Allen films the music was also tremendous. There are a whole host of great selections from that era. The acting was superb and the writing top drawer. Woody Allen has outdone himself this time.  ""Midnight In Paris"" is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by teens and seniors and everyone in between. Very highly recommended!",1341014400,2,3184,4.50259965337955

His fiance' is not on the same page. Late one night after dinner, Gil takes a midnight stroll and gets whisked away from his mundane life to his favorite era of Paris in the 1920's where he hobnobs with the great artists of the day. Gil is smitten with this nostalgic retreat from the ordinary. His romanticism clashes with his fiance's modern materialism. I won't give away the ending.",1340928000,2,744,4.477941176470588

4841401,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight In Paris is an enjoyable experience from start to finish. From the opening montage of images of Paris to the simple ending of Paris in the rain, it never drags or
goes off course. Gil (Owen Wilson) plays an American screenwriter who through some sort of magic, each night is transported to Paris in the 1920's.
Gil interacts with allthe players and the idols of his imaginations. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Cole Porter etc...
His interactions and conversations are intelligent and fun  Even with the fantastic premise the film never veers off to silliness or camp. The characters he meets not only accept Gil for who he is, but actually embrace him which is a stark contrast to his daytime reality.
Gil is in Paris with his fiancee who regularly treats Gil with disdain while at the same time planning their lives together in Malibu. Gil dreams of a simple life in Paris writing novels while she enjoys his career as a screenwriter and all it affords them in Hollywood. When Gil tries to explain and share his nocturnal experiences on the streets of Paris she dismisses him and recommends seeing a neurologist.
Michael Sheen brilliantly plays an intellectual snob who is an old friend of Gil's fiancee. It is classic Woody Allen characterization of the annoying know it all but it is great fun seeing Gil in the Woody Allen role subtly but hilariously handle him.
All of the cast is great especially the characters from the 1920's. The movie is gorgeously photographed and paced.
This movie has it all. Comedy, romance, beautiful photography, time travel, great characters, acting and a wonderful soundtrack of Cole Porter and instrumental music.
A great night at the movies. This was a movie made for the big screen and not for special effects or 3D. This was made for the big screen because it is a classic movie we want to sit in the dark and get lost in.",1340409600,3,1888,4.7560975609756095

4841405,4,B005MYEQ4U,"It took me awhile to go back to watching Owen Wilson in these light comedies after his real life suicide attempt because my suspension of disbelief was kind of shattered after that. I'm mean how can I take lightly and laugh at the characters he portrays when his real life is in such despair?

Anyway, I got over it when watching MIDNIGHT IN PARIS on a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo and I must say that I really enjoyed the movie and Wilson was sort of channeling a young Woody Allen for his character ""Gil,"" a script writer who is trying to write a novel. Gil and his fianc ""Inez,"" played by Rachel McAdams, go to Paris with her parents, and at midnight, Gil gets taken on a magical adventure to the roaring twenties and cafe society, meeting such luminaries as Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Josephine Baker, etc., all in their prime, and even gets to go further back to the ""Belle Epoch"" era.

The film makes great use of the sights in Paris and is shot with a warm filtered lens, so that everything has a yellow/reddish glow, reminding one of a romanticized version of ""Paris in spring-time."" Not only is the movie visually appealing, but there's a subtle message about how one can get caught up in living in the past -- or at least the idea of the past -- when really the only time that matters is the present.

Graphically, the MIDNIGHT IN PARIS Blu-Ray has stunning picture quality, as it should, and though it isn't a overly serious or uproariously funny movie it has its charm and can be regarded as a comfort movie for those times when we all wished we were living in another place and time.

Today's movies can definitely take hint, but probably won't.

Movies like this go underrated/overlooked/ignored/neglected and movies like avengers and avatar gross $2 billion, which is complete nonsense.

Being under 25 I can kind of understand why no one knew anything about this movie my age but it's easy to notice how today's generation lacks enthusiasm.

If you're someone who never likes watching romance movies, give this movie a chance and keep an open mind. A lot great people in history are mentioned like Ernest Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso and many many more.
I thought at some point Shakespeare might pop up, as Owen Wilson keeps going further and further in to the past.
Sadly Shakespeare didn't show up.

Adrian Broody has a small role as Salvador Dali whom I don't know much about but is just too funny to ignore.

This movie could be the work of a 25yo spoiled rich girl making a movie about life staged in Paris. Disconcertingly poor in terms of vision and message; eminently clich in terms of its references. I'm not pro or against Woodie Allen - I find some of his movies good, some more repetitive and average. And I love Owen Wilson. So really, my review is not one of these anti-Allen ones.

His movies in the last several years never let me down and I was looking forward to his new shot at comedy.  In this film there is assembly of great actors who give fabulous performances and their renditions of famous people who lived in Paris in 1920s: Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Matisse, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, to name a few.  The main character is an American Holywood screenplay writer on his trip to Paris daydreaming about abandoning his life in Malibu for a cozy little attic apartment in Paris.  Surely, his American fiancee, does not feel the same.  She just cannot comprehend why woudl anyone abandon big house in Malibu for small attic in Paris.  If American in Paris is a culture clash, than match between this Holywood screenwriter and his fiancee is definitely not match made in haven.

Surely, Woody uses his alter ego in this new character of a writer and it fits the story perfectly.  Owen Wilson is perfect choice for the role.  Supporting cast includes: Marion Cottilard, Carla Bruni. Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen to name a few.  Story is absolutely original and it is both funny and smart.

4841414,4,B005MYEQ4U,"This is the first time I've watched this Woody Allen film since its theatrical release in June, 2011.  I liked it then and I like it even more now.  Owen Wilson, subbing for a role Allen would normally play years ago, is Gil a successful screenwriter for U. S. television.  He doesn't like his job much and has been working on a book, hoping it will lead to a career as a novelist.  He has travelled to Paris with his fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents to make wedding arrangements.

Inez bumps into old acquaintances played by Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda.  Paul (Sheen) obviously has eyes for Inez that suggests a previous relationship.  He, Carol (Arianda) and Inez are looking to see the city and its environs but once exploring some of the sights, Paul's arrogance and smugness comes into play.  In one scene he argues with a museum guide (former first lady of France Carla Bruni) about which woman was the wife of a famous artist and which was the mistress.  Gil, who's had enough of Paul's I'm-always-right pontificating says he just finished the biography of Rodin and the guide is correct.  Of course he hadn't.

This all leads up to Gil's solo night time strolls through the neighborhoods of Paris.  At the stroke of midnight he is magically taken back to the 1920's, an era of Hemingway, Dali, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso and others.  He also meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard), one of Picasso's lovers.  They have an immediate attraction, but in this fantasy world, time is fleeting.

When I saw this film the first time around, I spent too much time trying to figure out the time travel component of the film.  Is this a dream?  Is Gil hallucinating? Is there another world occupying the space?  Forget about it.  This time, I just considered it movie magic and enjoyed the show.  Allen's script is terrific, especially when all the famous characters get to do their thing.  Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway and the seemingly everywhere now, Tom Hiddleston as Scott Fitzgerald are especially noteworthy.  Allen opens the film with some 4 to 5 minutes of beautiful dusk to dawn shots of Paris.  The City of Lights is another character in this wonderful character driven film.

The Blu ray version of this film is transferred in 1.78:1 and 1080p.  Paris looks great.  Allen focuses on a color palet of yellow, brown and gold hues.  The night time scenes sparkle with all the Parisian lights.  Like most Woody Allen films the audio soundtrack is nothing special.  Delivered in DTS-HD Master Audio 3.0, everything is up front.  It might have been nice to have the surrounds in play in that there is a good deal of club scenes in addition to the soundtrack.  Still, it's not a big deal.

4841420,5,B005MYEQ4U,"If you know Woody Allen's stand-up work from the 60s you'll know the European vacation sketch with Hemmingway and Gertrude Stein. This takes that singular idea and weaves it into a feature film - with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies.

On the one hand it's funny and engaging, a treat of a film. It's well cast with Owen Wilson doing a good `Woody' turn; Marion Cotllard perfect as the coquettish muse and Corey Stoll stealing the show as a laugh-out-loud Hemmingway. Michael Sheen is also hysterical. The humour is a mix of contemporary digs, the rightwing of the Republican Party is the butt of several funny lines, and knowing but funny references to Paris of the 20s (though I admit I had to look up who Djuna Barnes was). The film's message - that the past is a nostalgic illusion and we must live for today - is hardly subtle or original but definitely something we could all do with being reminded about from time to time.

On the other hand, there are plenty of flaws. The opening montage goes on far too long. I got it: we're in Paris! The relationship between Gil and Inez is too antagonistic to be credible. And since this is a concept movie, there's no real resolution to it; it can't go anywhere, so Woody just ends it with a downpour.

But these are criticisms that are easy to overlook. It's at its best when Owen Wilson is wandering through Paris of almost a century ago and for this part of the movie alone I'd recommend it. Utterly charming.",1338163200,2,1472,4.50561797752809

It's fun to imagine great 'what ifs' like those revealed here from very early in the film, but to see them come to their logical conclusions without beating the viewer over the head is why Woody Allen is still such a gifted film maker.
Owen Wilson's character is such an average guy that even his wardrobe is boring, too sensible and while well made it's also indistinct. That matters because it's a reflection of the character who has such extraordinary experiences that he becomes both a focus and a kind of background. His soon to be wife seems all right if a little overbearing, and unimaginative, but she dresses in style, she's sexy and young and has no problem showing it. Unfortunately where her clothing and attitude are more provocative her mind is drab, as are her ambitions. As the couple meets with friends and family in Paris the city is revealed as both an escape and a dream though still grounded in it's daylight and late evening hours with the occasionally rude waiter or brusque citizen, just like all large cities. The fantasy lies in the situation and not on misguided ideals.
When Wilson's character discovers a secret about about the city at midnight he's not sure what to make of the revelation but simply notes the oddness and goes with it. He probably accepts things as they are because in many ways he is living out what were fantasies now becoming a reality he should not be able to see, much less experience.
The trick of an experienced reality -as it is utilized in this construct- is that it impresses itself upon you as another layer of actual life and not as a delusion. Not only do you want to believe it, it almost has an inherent sense to it. That is where the premise succeeds where so many other attempts to do this in other films fail.
As the night life absorbs more of Wilson's character's interest the more effort he makes to balance out the two worlds, at least at first. The new reality also begins to show the rifts in the daylight life. Small ones we often take for granted are suddenly more obvious but also acceptable. His interaction with the noteworthy denizens of Paris' late evening crowd becomes a given, like he has two lives to live.
All I can conclude is how well this worked for me as well as the perfectly imperfect conclusion. It doesn't wrap up so much as it provides a stepping stone for the characters and audience to move on.
I like the running observations of the two prevailing views of Paris expressed by the characters because this is how a lot of Americans react to the city. I admit that I fall in the category that finds the city to be somewhat magical, even in it's reality and imperfections. And as such I don't expect anyone to agree with me.",1337817600,2,2766,4.500994035785288

4841445,5,B005MYEQ4U,"In 2011, Woody Allen would write and direct the film ""Midnight in Paris"", a romantic comedy/fantasy which has been praised as Woody Allen's best film in the last decade.

In fact, ""Midnight in Paris"" is Woody Allen's highest grossing film which has earned over $135 million in the box office.

The film features an all-star cast starring Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Carla Bruni, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard, Adrien Brody, Michael Sheen to name a few.

For Allen, the film is a return to fantasy such as his 1985 film ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" and the screenplay was written around the title of the film ""Midnight in Paris"" and his goal was to capture Paris, focus on the romantic elements of the film and its warm ambience.  The film would mark Allen's first film to go through a digital intermediate and literally an experiment to find out if he would like to use the process in his next films.

""Midnight in Paris"" is a film that focuses on Gil (played by Owen Wilson, ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"", ""Bottle Rocket""), a Hollywood screenwriter who has traveled with his fiancee, Inez (played by Rachel McAdams, ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Mean Girls"", ""Sherlock Holmes"") and her wealthy and conservative parents to Paris.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Midnight in Paris"" is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English and French 3.0 LCR (Discrete Surround). Woody Allen's goal to capture the beauty of Paris was successful!  Darius Khondji and Johanne Debas did a fantastic job in capturing these breathtaking scenes of the Parisian streets, various locations and for the most part, everything looks good on DVD.

But if anyone wants to experience the best picture and audio quality, you definitely want to watch this movie on Blu-ray!  In fact, while I was watching this film on DVD, I kept telling myself of how beautiful those scenes would look in HD!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Midnight in Paris"" comes with the following special features:

  Midnight in Cannes - (4:57) Featuring excerpts of the Cannes Film Festival press conference as Woody Allen and cast talk about filming in Paris and working on the film.
  Theatrical Trailer - (2:05) The original theatrical trailer for ""Midnight in Paris"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Delightful, clever and witty... Woody Allen serves up a wonderful romantic comedy with ""Midnight in Paris"" and yet another fantastic  film to add to his amazing oeuvre.

When it comes to Woody Allen, you just never know what you're going to get with his films, especially within the last 20-years.  Many film critics have wondered if the filmmaker has lost his magic that he exhibited earlier in his career but I have always watched his films, past and present and have enjoyed them.  Sure, the older films have a style, an allure, to them that emits ""classic"" Woody Allen filmmaking and one that many have hoped to see again.

With ""Midnight in Paris"", although Allen doesn't star in the film, fortunately Owen Wilson manages to tap into a Woody persona and are able to achieve an efficacy of Woody Allen magic.  Romantic, witty and absolute charming, ""Midnight in Paris"" is a film that captivated me from beginning to end and it was a film that I enjoyed tremendously.

When it comes to capturing romance in the city, may it be bleak or happy, may it be in New York, London or Barcelona, how perfect would it be for Allen to capture a romantic comedy in Paris?

And he does it with ""Midnight in Paris"".  From its opening breathtaking scenes of the famous areas of the city, I was captivated from the start.

But its the characters that made me love this movie and it's also the clever insight to those characters that I found delightful.  Owen Wilson does a remarkable job of playing Gil, the writer seeking inspiration but its that creative desire that he gets from Paris that gives him vitality.  Vitality that runs counter to the lost energy he gets when he's around his fiance Inez.

Inez plays the soul sucking fiance.  Not so supportive of her fiance, despite having knowledge of art, poetry and literary work, she would rather listen to her friend Paul, a wannabe verite that is pompous and your typical Mr. Know-it-All, or more like he thinks he knows it all.

But it's when we see the fantasy element of Woody Allen's film start to take shape, of how we see the creative Gil finding inspiration by returning to what he thinks is the Golden Year of creativity, the 1920's.  The time of the Lost Generation and for anyone who are avid readers, those who follow poetry, art and cinema...one can easily ask themselves, how would it have been to have an association, friendship with the talents of Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein, etc.

To use the words of Ernest Hemingway from his memoir ""A Moveable Feast"", ""If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast"".

What would one do if you had the chance to go back in time, France ala 1920's and to associate with these individuals?

This is where ""Midnight in Paris"" becomes charming and fun, and as I watched, I watched with a big grin because we see the character of Gil, the classic Woody Allen character, getting that opportunity. There is no focus on how Gil is able to go back in time, all that matters is that he is with people that understand him, people from a Lost Generation which he has looked at as ""The Golden Years"" for those individuals he had respected.

And because of this,  the use of these famous figures and Gil's interaction with them may be pleasing to an audience or may go over their heads of why one would find certain situations funny or hilarious.

While ""Midnight in Paris"" by no means does one have to be an erudite of their work to enjoy the film, it does make things a bit more intriguing if you do.  From the relationships between Hemingway and Gertrude Stein or Hemingway with the Fitzgerald's or Picasso's many mistresses, I loved how the film touched upon those little things.  But its not necessary to understand them.  For example, the woman that Gil starts to fall for...Adriana, is a fictional character.  A mistress of Picasso who loves couture, who is interested in Gil (as Gil has interest in her) but because he is engaged to Inez, how will his time with Adriana change him?

As for little details that I found intriguing, you see Gil visiting the bookstore ""Shakespeare & Company"". The significance is that its a bookstore that Hemingway would visit and read various books that inspired him.

One of the most hilarious parts of the film, which fans of filmmaker Luis Bunuel would be interested in, is a scene where Gil is offering a filmmaking idea.

Gil:  Mr. Bunuel, I have a nice idea for a movie for you?

Luis: Yes?

Gil: A group of people attend a formal dinner party and at the dinner, when they try to leave the room, they can't.

Luis: Why not?

Gil: They just can't just seem to exit the door?

Luis: But...But why?

Gil: Well...Momento.  When they are forced to stay together, the veneer of civilization quickly fades away and what you are left with is... who they real are...animals.

Luis: But I don't get it, why don't they just walk out of the room?

Gil: All I am asking is for you to think about it.  Who knows, when you are shaving one day, it may tickle your fancy.

Luis: I don't understand...what is holding them in the room?

While possibly this discussion may go over the heads of most audiences, for cinema fans, one can only grin as Gil is talking about Bunuel's Academy Award winning surrealist film from 1972, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"".

So, there are small details that I just found delightful and fun, and with the whole film shot in Paris and having that touristy but yet enchanting flair, I couldn't help but enjoy the beauty of the film and enjoy the film and see the journey of Gil and how Paris changes him.

As for the DVD, I think ""Midnight in Paris"" actually breaks new ground.  I believe this is the first Woody Allen film to include a special feature.  It's generally known and mentioned in many other reviews that Woody Allen is not a big fan of special features and with each release, all you are getting is a trailer.  But with this DVD (and possibly for the Blu-ray release), you get a four minute special feature from the Cannes press conference for ""Midnight in Paris"".  Sure, it's short but take what you can get Woody Allen fans, the fact that there is a special feature aside from the trailer is actually surprising.

While the DVD is a very solid release, if you have a Blu-ray player, this is one of those films that features beautiful scenery that you want to watch it on HD.  This is a very entertaining film that is worth watching on Blu-ray but otherwise, if you don't have a Blu-ray player and don't plan to get one, then the DVD is very good!

Overall, ""Midnight in Paris"" is a fantastic Woody Allen film, especially those familiar with the famous figures presented in the film.  But a beautiful, delightful and fun film that is definitely recommended!",1335571200,2,9189,4.663354037267081

4841448,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen has always given me mixed emotions possibly because he is so prolific.  I'll go on record and say that ""Annie Hall"" is the most overrated film of all time.  When he's brilliant he produces great work like ""Manhattan"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Mighty Aphrodite"".  When he indulges himself you get ""Celebrity"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"".  ""Midnight in Paris"" is neither great or self-indulgent.  It's a nice little fantasy with a message which is the time you have foisted on you is the best of times.  Allen is careful not to beat the message into the ground.  Allen makes Paris as sumptuous and exciting as he did in prior films for his beloved New York.  Owen Wilson as a scriptwriter who dreams of being a novelist does admirable work.  He serves as a kind of a surrogate of Allen's but he doesn't make the mistake of trying to impersonate him.  The weak link is probably the portrayal of the historic figures Wilson's Gil meets in his foray to the past who are little more than wax figures.  It's a bit of a shock becuase they are portrayed by an array of good actors.  Regardless, the buzz this film created isn't from it being inherently great but from it's appeal to a mass audience as well as Allen's normal afficienadoes.",1335052800,2,1246,4.613636363636363
4841449,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I was surprised that this movie was nominated for a 2011 Academy Award for Best Picture.  Was it really that good?  Apparently some people thought so.  Like some others I am not a Woody Allen fan but I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it was a light, fluffy trifle.  Out of the gate the main set-up of Gil's (a demure Owen Wilson) romantic notions of writing a great novel being met by his fiancee's (the ever-lovely Rachel McAdams, here playing the fascist ""I-know-what's-best-for-you"" girlfriend tripe) dismissiveness feels utterly familiar; this mismatch was written as about as loudly on the walls so to speak as a neon Nordstrom's sign blares against the dark nighttime.  So what made this movie click then?  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet but I'll just say that there is a little magic afoot which brings Gil's romantic writer into contact with various literary and artistic historical figures such as Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali; the offbeat spirit and portrayal of these characters is a minor delight, perhaps moreso to those viewers who are much more intimately acquainted with them.  The filmography of Paris is gorgeous (and sanitized), a loving ode to the city of light.  And no characters are drawn out to be utterly repulsive (though some of their behavior would be in reality, all is neatly forgiven or waxed over in almost sitcom fashion) so no real sour taste is left in your mouth (or memory).  Like I said, the movie is a light, fluffy trifle.  It's popcorn fare (Kettle corn?) for the arthouse and Woody Allen set I suppose.  Nothing wrong with that.  But a best pic nom?

4841459,5,B005MYEQ4U,"My wife and I have been longtime Woody Allen fans.  We always preferred his zanier, early movies, like ""Take the Money and Run,"" ""Play It Again, Sam,"" ""Sleeper,"" and so on.  Truly, some of his more recent efforts have been disappointing, to say the least.  But ""Midnight in Paris"" far exceeded our expectations.

We looked at some of the other reviews and can't see what commenters are talking about.  The movie is beautifully shot and directed.  Owen Wilson is simply terrific as Woody's alter ego, and the storyline is totally engaging.  Sure, it's a bit of science fiction, with characters moving back and forth in time.  But that's what makes it so creative and different as a Woody Allen film.

Back on Owen Wilson, he is a revelation in his mannerisms and halting speech.  He must have studied Woody's other movies, at length, where he himself was the central character.  It truly is an amazing performance and one you won't forget, if you're a Woody Allen fan.

The other actors do well, too, with this quirky, yet profound story.  Paris looks gorgeous throughout and, on its review, the chamber of commerce must have done cartwheels.  The music was fine, centering as it did on Cole Porter and similar pieces from the 1920's.

Summing up, this is the Woody Allen film we've been waiting for for a long time.  It truly is a masterpiece and we can only hope there will be more like this from the master.  He's proven he doesn't need bathroom humor or stark, sexual references to make a movie.  Five stars and highly recommended.",1333584000,3,1534,4.681647940074907

The idea is genius and the story just pops! I just finished a college course on Hemingway and Fitzgerald, so this was a sweet bonus to watch. And the actors who portray Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill) are excellent! Especially Stoll. I also enjoyed the appearances of other artists and writers (Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, Henri Matisse, T.S. Eliot, Josephine Baker, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, and Edgar Degas). Allen takes a concept that most fall into -- that of wanting to live in another time (I myself have sometime I wished in Paris in the 1920s also, or in the 1930s) -- and finds his own voice of explaining its fault. For anyone who knows of these artists, writers and musicians, you'll love the small ""inside trivia jokes"" referenced.

He and his finacee (Rachel McAdams) are visiting her parents in Paris, and while she is interested in catching up with old friends in the city, he is taken by the beauty of Paris in the rain, and Paris at night. He laments the past and is enchanted by stories of the 1920s when the biggest celebrities spent their time in Paris nightclubs. One night, after lots of drinking, Gill goes for a walk, and a vintage automobile picks him up and transports him back in time where he rubs elbows with the most elite figures of the time, from the Fitzgeralds to Hemingway to Gertrude Stein to Dali and Picasso.

This movie has the easy sentimentality of many Woody Allen movies. One gets the impression that he writes for himself above anyone else, and that is okay because many can identify with his passions. This movie glamorizes Paris the way other Allen movies glamorize New York and it has the same winsome quality of The Purple Rose of Cairo. There is a moral, and it is spelled out quite clearly, but although this movie has the same format of most stories, it flows calmly like a lazy river.

You just go along for the ride and are excited when you recognize famous writers and painters.  These characters are woven into the plot seamlessly.  Being a Woody Allen movie, I hadn't expected such a careful, low key approach.  However, you can definitely hear Woody's words coming out of the characters mouths.  It isn't often that my husband and I agree on a movie, but he enjoyed it too.  In fact, he's the one who said we should order the DVD after watching it from an Amazon download.

4841470,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's latest, Midnight in Paris, is in the vein of nostalgia we have had from him since Manhattan, combined with his framing of a picturesque city:there it was rhapsodic,here it is small-scale. Owen Wilson plays Gil,an unemployed Hollywood screenwriter working on his first novel,holidaying with his fiance Inez(McAdams)prior to their wedding. Allen's Paris is seductively lit,but doesn't feel modern or real and largely unpeopled. Allen uses his old trick of wit and whimsy(a la Purple Rose) to effect time travel by midnight Peugot cab to Paris in the 20s to meet Hemingway,the Fitzgeralds,Cole Porter,Dali,Picasso,Bunuel,Stein, the Lost Generation. He is bored with his fiance who belittles him in front of a male friend Paul(Sheen),who he lets go out with while Gil wanders the streets,jumping time,getting a review of his latest novel from Stein and Hemingway, while falling in love with Adriana(Cotillard),Picasso's mistress. The here and now is just another fantasy so there is no farewell to nostalgia. The Belle Epoque they also visit,meeting Degas and Lautec, are surprised they think it so great. Contentment is always backward-looking,Gil must set aside fantasy and make do with the here and now.

Inez's mother and father,Tea Party types,have their doubts about Gil,and have him followed by a private detective,who ends up as the object of the best joke in the film. Owen Wilson is charming and carries off the name-dropping Allen lines with comic verve,Hemingway(Stoll) is superbly gruff,Dali(Brody)a wizard of crazy wit. There are beautiful cameos from Cotillard and Lea Sedoux. There are some good one-liners as Gil negotiates seamlessly between the past and the present and the music,Bechet,Porter,gives the uncanny power of nostalgia a boost. While being without the energy of Vicky Christina Barcelona,it's a dreamy and jazzy bauble of vintage Allen and better. I think Allen has become a byword for rosy nostalgia and present fantasy.",1333152000,,1962,5.432786885245902
4841471,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I've never been more envious of a fictional character than I was of Owen Wilson's character in Midnight in Paris. Paris in the 1920s amongst all those great geniuses must have been something to behold, but I like that this movie takes a quirky bent with the nostalgia theme by downplaying the whole concept of nostalgia in arguing that everyone thinks the era they currently live in is boring. No matter when you were alive, you always pine to want to live during another time instead.

It would have been nice if Woody Allen had inserted James Joyce somewhere into the plotline,as he was a significant fixture during the era which this movie celebrates(Joyce's name is mentioned briefly in some dialogue, but that's it). Also, if you miss Adrien Brody it's probably because you blinked briefly. Hopefully the mild success of this movie will rejuvenate interest in some of these long-ago artists, but it probably won't since none of them wrote about vampires.",1332892800,3,959,4.883435582822086
4841472,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Owen Wilson plays amiable Gil, a self admitted ""Hollywood hack"" script writer from Beverly Hills. He has a fiance so Malibu Barbie you can easily imagine a product number on the bottom of her foot, a pair of irritable, materialistic, Republican in-laws, and a novel he is having difficulty translating from thoughts to paper.
Gil is thrilled to be in Paris, where his father-in-law is making a nondescript business deal, and is expressing this by immersing himself in the locations and stories of writers, artists, and musicians long gone, while his fiance gripes about how charming the streets are. Friends of his wife arrive seemingly by surprise, a patronizing ""intellectual"" who collects facts only to impress other people with them and his oblivious wife. Gil finds them overbearing but his wife is charmed, and the group separates. On his way back to the hotel, Gil gets himself hopelessly lost, as predicted by his wife, but instead of panicking, he sits down on some steps and listens to the clock chime at midnight. A car manufactured almost a century ago rolls around the corner, and Gil is invited in by a group of strangers wreathed in smoke and laden with champagne glasses. Much in the same way Alice falls down a rabbit hole and discovers herself in Wonderland, Gil realizes he has been transported to the 1920's, and the handful of journeys he takes there are parallel to hers. Each night he enters the car, someone new is there to greet him, from Scott Fitzgerald to Hemingway to T.S. Eliot, Gil bounces like a ping pong ball from one long gone idol to the next, going to drink, going to dance, going to get help with his novel from Gertrude Stein.

This is a simple movie that doesn't bother to explain just how Gil gets to the 1920's because it isn't necessary to know, and even if we did know it wouldn't have any bearing on the story. It is never implied that Gil might be hallucinating or dreaming; and we are pleased about this, because we like Gil, we are like Gil, we understand.
The message is straightforward ""Enjoy what you have and don't dwell on or in the past because even the past thinks the past is better"" (indeed of course we would all like to live in the past because we are already aware of what was good and what was bad there, while in the present hardly anyone knows what is going on or if where they are is the best place they could be), and actually established fairly early, but it's a raving blast to get there.",1332806400,5,2455,4.566893424036281

4841475,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Scott and Zelda (no last name needed for Jazz Age aficionados, right?), Cole Porter, T.S. Eliot, Man Ray, Pablo Picasso, hell even Djuana Barnes are names from the Jazz Age and the American post- World War I ex-paraite night that get bandied about in Woody Allen's 2011 comedic effort, Midnight In Paris. There were plenty of other names dropped as well but the above popped out in memory's eye and serve my point. This film is a paen to that by-gone age just far enough back for Woody (and me) to not have been splashed by the Jazz Age karma but wishing, wishing like crazy, we could have lived at that time -in that city, Paris and been washed by the spectacular antics and struggles that went on there to create a modern literary and cultural world. And in the end that is Woody's point, as he has one of his throw-back jazz Age characters pine for an even earlier time- the last quarter of the 19th century-La Belle Epogue. Nice spin, Woody.

But to the plot that brings this whole thing together in magic realistic way and without being too ham-handed on the ""moral"". Woody (oops) Gil (played with some Woody-like physical and expressive mannerism by Owen Wilson) is a thouroughly modern frustrated Hollywood screenwriter who yearns to write the great American novel, or at least something other than the drivel that passes for language in most of his screenwriting. He and his fianc, Inez (played by Rachael McAdams), are in Paris on a lark before getting married. Gil loves Paris, his version of Paris, the Paris of the American ex -pat 1920s Jazz Age when the great creative spirits of the early 20th century held forth and lit up the cultural post-war wasteland night.  Inez is a little, no, a lot more bourgeois, and just wants Gil to keep making the kale so they can afford that high-end La-La land lifestyle. This will no be a match made in heaven, no question.

Gil though through cinematic magical realism finds his way back to the Paris of the 1920s around midnight each night and from there is able to find his true self, or what he thinks is his true self. Naturally a women (Pablo Picasso's, mistress, or one of them) is there to goad him along but also to pose the question about what craving for earlier unattainable times mean. In the end Gil is ""liberated"" from Inez (she was two-timing him anyway with some pedantic prof) and can walk the rainy 2010s streets of Paris and really make his literary breakthrough. This is one of  Woody's better recent efforts. Proof. A person whom I respect very much as a cinematic aficionado said this is the first Woody Allen film that she could sit through to the end and wish that it didn't end.

Personally, I think that this film should have won Best Picture, Best Director and many other awards. ""The Artist"" was predictable. ""The ""Descendants"" annoyed me. If any child of mine spoke to me that way, I'd up-end them! But ""Midnight in Paris"" was a charming, feel-good film that satisfied my romantic longings.

4841482,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I enjoyed this movie.  Born and raised in Paris but living in the US these last 40 years, I could relate to Allen's nostalgia. The opening scenic tour to the music of Sidney Bechet transported me back in time.

Woody Allen is not Dostoyevski or Fritz Lang; he has a light touch and doesnt pretend to have a deep message.  And it is not so bad. I loved Bananas and Anny Hall, so I didn't expect a gloomy philosophical lecture.

This is a fantasy; one that most of us would like to live: how would it be to go back in time and meet so-and-so? And so we do meet some celebrities, and it is a lot of fun.  Some reviewers said that the actor playing Salvador Dali overdid it; actually, he was way more reserved than his character.

Besides leading us through nocturnal time travels, this film does deal with life and death, serious topics if there ever were, but with a light touch, as always.

In sum, this film is about fantasy, entertaining, and if there is a message, it is about living.  The cast is excellent, the music is wonderful.  I was a bit disconcerted by the cinematography as the greens seemed artficially bright.  Enjoy it, and you may be surprised that it will stay with you afterwards.",1332201600,,1198,4.380090497737557

The film opens with a montage of Parisian scenes that is visually exquisite; all the famous landmarks that point to why Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

If it's been a while since your last visit to Paris, or if you have yet to experience this marvelous city, I believe you will feel compelled to remedy that situation. After the gorgeous visual/musical intro we're carried on to a classic Woody Allen film. Watching Owen Wilson in the lead role is reminiscent of every character Woody Allen played. The two men seem disparate but not in this film, Mr. Allen's characteristics and vocal rythms seem to be channeled through Owen Wilson. The supporting cast, major and minor, all shine, no doubt due to Mr. Allen's written word. The fun of a Woody Allen film is you are encouraged to use your imagination too; take the film at face value as a lark, or delve a little deeper. Make what you will of this little tale of time travel, real or imagined, and listen for the voiced conclusion, whether you agree, or not. In the meantime let yourself revel in Paris in the 20's meeting all the artistic greats of that era.

4841491,3,B005MYEQ4U,"There is a very good side to this movie and a very bad side.

Woody Allen has made some very good movies and some really awful movies; this one combines both sides.

The good side is that part of the movie's plot is charmingly original: a wannabe writer (Gil) in Paris has a surrealistic experience (which is ironic) and at midnight he goes back to the Paris of the 1920s, transported in a gorgeous car to die for. He meets a who's who of the intellectual elite of the time: Cole Porter, Jean Cocteau, Luis Bunuel, Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot and Salvador Dali (what? no Ezra Pound?). Here, Allen has done his homework and the actors portray those personages perfectly; for example, Hemingway's speech is an aggressive staccato while Dali speaks as if he was on drugs. The enthusiasm that Gil experiences is infectious. The costumes are great as are the settings. As for Paris, it is a beautiful city, especially if one ignores the Parisians, whom even the French despise (and that says something right there!).

Now for the bad side.
Woody Allen is a pseudointellectual who likes to put down other pseudointellectuals and we see it in Gil's rivalry with Paul, as well as in other films. And only a pseudointellectual would think that living in Paris, and only in Paris, will automatically make one a good writer. Hundreds of superb writers, from Pushkin to Narayan to Unamono to Poe never lived in Paris. Mind you, Paris is a beautiful city, but so is Florence, London, Munich, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Kyoto, etc. etc. As for the French being so much superior to Americans in everything . . . give me a break.

As for the characters, they are caricatures, just cliches. Inez, Gil's fiancee, is a relentlessly ball busting bitch with whom Gil admits he has nothing in common, at which point we have to ask: just exactly why is he marrying her? On top of that she admits an infatuation with Paul and admits to cheating on Gil by sleeping with Paul. O . . . K . . . As for Gil, he is such a wimp! Even when he learns of this, he does nothing in retaliation to either Inez or Paul. I suppose that that is called being a superior intellect. His future in-laws are even worse cliches; the father is a crass businessman (gee, what a surprise) who cannot appreciate France's superiority on all things, and the mother is only interested in buying expensive stuff.

The character of Gil is interesting only because he is a younger, blonde version of Woody Allen: the verbosity, the catty comments, the wimpiness, even some of the gestures. In a way this is a relief because if there is one thing that we do not need to see again is Allen, who nowadays looks like death warmed over, attempting to be a ladies' man.

Throughout, Gil is in conflict with his fiancee; he wants to stay in Paris and thereby automatically becoming a great writer while she wants him to return to California to lead a crass commercial life. In the end, he decides to stay in Paris, whereupon he instantly meets his soulmate (gee, what a surprise).

See the movie, but definitely don't buy it.",1331683200,2,3115,4.581687612208259
4841492,5,B005MYEQ4U,"After watching Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, I want to find myself in a situation where I'm having a conversation with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD novelist Richard Yates. With my luck, though, I'd probably be stuck making small talk with late-period Tennessee Williams.

But no, I shouldn't be snobbish: after all, the film's main character, Gil (played by Owen Wilson) is quick to denounce a friend of his fiance's as a ""pseudo-intellectual"". In other words, the kind of guy like Gil - a hopeless romantic who wishes he lived in Paris, is constantly correcting others on their knowledge of art esoterica, and, worst of all, is a Hollywood screenwriter who really wants to write Novels That Mean Something.

Gil is in Paris with his fiance, and despite the obvious postcard potential of the city, Gil's problems go beyond one city. Frankly, it's a problem with the world: well, Gil doesn't think the time he lives in is very inspiring, for him or anyone.

So Woody Allen throws him a bone: while Gil is walking the streets of Paris at midnight, he sends him a car to take him to the 1920s. Gil starts to get the picture when he meets a lovely couple at a party: Zelda, and her lover Scott Fitzgerald.

This isn't science-fiction. After meeting the Fitzgeralds, Gil runs into Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway (who is given to come-ons like, ""Have you ever shot a charging lion?""), Gertrude Stein, Salvador Dali, and onward. Hemingway gives some writing advice to Gil: ""If you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer! But not while I'm around!"" Stein and Pablo Picasso have arguments over whether a painting of his overly sexualizes his subject. The painting's subject is a gorgeous young woman named Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who's been with Picasso, Braque and Modigliani, but finds herself drawn to something different in this American.

MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is a movie about the past and the present, but mostly it's a movie about artists: Gil discussing his novel and life with those who would be most qualified to wax about it. And it's a gem of a plot, a lovely fantasy that surprises you at first, and then pulls you in with a dedication to romance.

Thankfully the entirety of MIDNIGHT`s focus isn't Famous Names Talking - but it does tend to focus on them a little too much. To something of a detriment, it's a movie about art, rather than one about characters.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the fact that, in the present day, Gil is engaged to a woman (Rachel McAdams) who quite clearly does not share his views on, well, anything. Her mother is typically condescending, and her father is a diehard Tea Party fan who sees a possible Communist in Gil. At one point, thinking that Gil has brought her a gift of jewelry, she responds, ""I hope it's my taste.""

As the movie goes on, it becomes clear that the scenes with McAdams and her family are only seen by Woody as pauses between the 1920s scenes. They're not very funny. There's a pseudo-slapstick scene involving a missing pair of earrings that's painful in its false caricature. It's more than a shame that McAdams isn't given much to do besides be angry and shallow.

Especially because, in a way, you can understand a frustration that her fiance, already spending too much time writing instead of being with her, is now babbling about sharing a night with Pablo Picasso. Who wouldn't dislike a guy like that?

It's a testament to Woody Allen's skill that a strange thing happens as the movie continues: you stop being annoyed at Gil's precious self-consciousness (and at Owen Wilson's over-earnest performance), and you start being as charmed as Allen obviously is by his love of beauty. All those artists whose job it is to observe the world and explain it in a beautiful way; all the picture perfectness of Paris landmarks in the ""Golden Age""; it's intoxicating. And Gil learns the lesson he needs to learn at the end, and it's handled in a lovely, realistic way that makes perfect sense once you get to it.

It's a very good film. Because it's not as concerned with characters as it should be, it sometimes drags while we wait for Gil to move on to the next Famous Face. But Owen Wilson's obvious excitement is contagious, and Marion Cotillard is as charming as expected and more, and things move just as they should to a proper, tender conclusion. And also, you have Paris in the day and the night - which, even in Gil's uninspiring Present, can't hurt.",1331596800,3,4427,4.714100905562742

This is a wonderful fantasy that dares you to suspend disbelief, because even the protagonist Gill cannot believe it. Yet he is forced to accept it, because there it is, up on the screen so to speak. We have no choice either. How much bolder a device can you think of than that?

As usual with most Allen films, this one sports a terrific cast, even from its cameo stars like Adrien Brody. Sometimes it's hard to get past Owen Wilson channeling Allen in the role (for me, anyway), but the other actors more than make up for it by providing stellar support.

4841510,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight in Paris

If you have, as I, followed the career of Woody Allen from the early days, and one of his great fans, you will like this movie, because it is a fresh dose of Allen shtick. The elements of this shtick are: upscale, self-absorbed couple, usually a writer (guess who?), swank dinner parties, elevated conversation on art, politics, etc., man in emotional crisis, infatuated with an elusive, unobtainable beauty, and all the while counseled by a father figure. We've seen it all before, from Annie Hall, onwards, which made Allen's films, while flawless movie-making, all a bit dull and predictable.

While he uses his same ol' shtick, Midnight in Paris is different. This movie after all is about a love affair, yes, but Paris and the lost generation of American expatriates and other avant garde artists living in Paris in the 20s are subjects. The script is inventive and orginal, and the characterizations of Hemingway, Fitgerald, etc., are dead-on. So while the elements of the Allen shtick are present -- I mean, who talks about art in their daily conversation, anyway? The only time the people I know talk about painting is when it covers the walls -- the movie is fresh, alive, and original, and a joy to behold. Owen Wilson especially seems to have been born to play this role. He is, as Allen remarked, a natural actor.

So if you like Woody Allen but think he had gotten a little predictable, try this movie out. You will like it.",1330560000,2,1456,4.724409448818897

Hemingway, F. Scott, etc. came off nowhere and leaves the viewer feeling their use was ham-handed. Oic: we really shouldn't expect others to live our life for us. Most of us figured that out by high school.  B-O-R-I-N-G + DESPERATION as  Allen slips into a seeming malaise lately of Communist POV mixes with more and more 2-dimensional schemes.

I'd recommend it if  you're looking for a fun and delightful film!",1330387200,,502,4.1875
4841514,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I was introduced to this movie by my daughter who said this is a picture about a writer who wants to live in the past, who thinks the past is better than the present, and it is about Paris, a place known as the Mecca for artists.

I recognized it was a Woody Allen film, and knowing his early works, ""Annie Hall"" and ""Everything you always wanted to know about sex (but were afraid to ask)"", I was already biased and not particularly attracted to watch it. My thinking was, ""oh, another Paris movie, must be about paintings, the arrogant Parisians, and Woody Allen made it? It must be weird."" With that mindset and on a boring evening, I sat to see it, mostly because Rachel McAdams (""The Notebook"") was in it. About Owen Wilson, the main actor in the film, the only previous work I liked of him was ""Behind Enemy Lines"" because I love movies about jet fighters, but I need to admit that I had not seen much of his work anyway.

""Midnight in Paris"" is a tour de force, nonetheless! I saw a very different picture than my daughter described. This movie is about the clashing of personalities: a person with a creative mind, shy, simple and kind of bohemian, as opposed to his fiance representing a modern and materialistic American woman. Likewise, it is about a person encased in the logical world, feeling out of place and eventually breaking from it.

Yet, it is a comedy and Woody Allen wrote it masterfully. Owen Wilson plays Gil Bender, a script writer working for Hollywood, who doesn't really like much of his job and would rather become a novelist. He goes to Paris with his fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, as her dad is a successful and wealthy businessman who enters into a merger with a French company.

Gil has in fact written his first novel, still a manuscript he's not convinced is good enough and without the confidence to show it to anyone. One night, after a day of touring in Paris with his ""material girl"" and her pedantic friends, Gil brakes free from them and go for a walk. He gets lost and at midnight, in despair and sitting on a set of stairs on the street, a Peugeot from the 1920s appear and he is invited to join the people in the car. This car is the time machine that transports Gil to the 1920s. It is reminiscent of the DeLorean in ""Back to the Future"".

Over several nights, as the trips repeat, Gil meets with writers Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and other artists: painters Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, and film director Luis Buuel.

Allen wrote magnificent lines for Hemingway (Corey Stoll), and one notable is when Gil, influenced by his own low self-esteem, describes his book as terrible. Hemingway replies, ""No subject is terrible if the story is true, and if the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.""

This is a story about nostalgia for ""the golden age"", but more than being a stage where famous artists of the past come to life, it is about a search into one's footing. Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), whom Hemingway uses to critic his work, tells Gil about his book, ""We all fear death and question our place in the universe...you have a clear and lively voice, don't be such a defeatist."" The critic of his novel, along with those unusual encounters with his literary idols and his attraction with Picasso's lover, Adriana (Marion Cottilard), gave Gil the kick he needed to refuel and find fresh inspiration. Gil discovers a new meaning for his life and a willingness to direct it to a completely different destination.

Lest I be portrayed as an idealist, I must mention that Allen romanticizes and embellishes Paris and the bohemian world of the artist, underscored by Gil willingness to exchange his home in Beverly Hills for a little attic with a skylight in Paris. He described the city as one where ""every street, every boulevard is its own special art form... how anyone can come up with a book, or a painting, or a symphony, or a sculpture that can compete with a great city"",  and Paris ""is the hottest spot on the universe."" Additionally, the color of the film has a slight emphasis on orange, depicting the images of the city with a delicate age and warmth.

The movie exposes the diametrical contrast of the logical mind with the creative one. Allen has a tendency to discredit the first and enhance the latter through the dialog. However, his scenes portray the artists' nightlife as one where self-destructive behavior like heavy drinking, smoking, and dancing and partying all night long is the norm. Love, or sex for that matter, is exchanged as a commodity. Allen takes the opportunity, as well, to throw a few punches to the Republicans and the Tea Party, describing them as ""demented lunatics"" and using the expression ""respect each other views"" in the same line, an obvious contradiction.

This movie demonstrates Allen's mastering of the script, the scenery, and the conduction of his message through a delicate comedy, which serves as his vehicle to entertain, to expose and display his ideological vision in a very clever manner. However, the characterization of opposite and irreconcilable views are repeated throughout the movie. This is exemplified on this quote from Ms. Stein when describing Picasso's portray of Adriana, ""He's done her, dripping with sexual innuendo, carnal to the point of smoldering and yes, she's beautiful, but it's a subtle beauty, an implied sensuality."" Admittedly, the movie is quite entertaining and a no-less fine presentation that seduces the audience to take a trip to a world of fantasy.",1330387200,6,5564,4.731682146542828

4841520,4,B005MYEQ4U,"One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors), Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often turbulent relationships between men and women.  Almost exclusively a New Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the writer/director at the top of his game.

Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux).  At the fabled Giverny, Monet's source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble constantly.  An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car drives by and gives him a ride to a caf.  Gil realizes that he has been transported to 1920's Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Gil is struggling with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein (amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures Gil's fancy.  Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.

This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy, storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy.  You do wonder how Gil and Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about most everything.  It's also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an obvious connection.  Such is love.

Gil is a surrogate for Allen's inner voice. (One could even picture a younger Allen actually performing the role.)  He is also a romantic in contrast to Inez's friends who are intellectuals.  As for Paris, it plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story.  It is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his home base of New York City.

There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later (and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great effect in a brief scene.

Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but it's been a long while since he made anything as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time.  Vive le Woody Allen!",1330041600,,3762,4.7615384615384615

All the painters and writers featured in the film add a vintage touch that makes you nostalgic for the 1920s even though most of us were born no where near that great decade of the ""Lost Generation""...and, which is the point of the movie.

Owen Wilson convinces us of his pessimism and insecurities the way Woody Allen does in earlier films.  Rachel McAdam does a great job of being annoying and superficial.

4841524,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is a wonderful little film, a beutiful love affair with Paris of both today and a bygone era.  It's a pleasant and enchanting story about a modern day writer (Owen Wilson)who magically travels back in time to Paris in the 1920s where he meets famous writers and artists of the the time including Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein, and maybe where he falls in love.  The cinematography in sumptious and the attention to period detail amazing.  Do you need to know these writers and artists?  Not really.  If you know a little about how Hemingway writes, you'll appreciate how funny a character Woody Allen has created in his Hemingway.  Other than that, most of the historical people are window-dressing (although there's a really funny scene built around a meeting of surrealist artists including Adrian Brody as Salvadore Dali).  Humor is at times subtle and at other times broad.  Much of the broad humor comes from remarks about the writer (Wilson) made by Rachel McAdams as his fiancee, and by her mother -- but for me, the two female characters are so bitchy as to be obnoxious.  I think, for the sake of humor, Woody Allen erred in making the fiancee and her parents such stereotypes.  It is the only false note in an otherwise wonderful and lovely movie. For me, Midnight in Paris is worth owning as I expect to watch it many times over.",1329868800,6,1372,4.726890756302521
4841525,2,B005MYEQ4U,"Let me make a prediction. I'll tell you the plot of Woody Allen's next movie: Slightly dorky guy is in love with an impossibly beautiful woman, a woman much too pretty for him. He can't trust the relationship, so he goes to great lengths to sabotage it.

I can make this prediction fearlessly, because this is the only film Woody Allen makes. People who say he has made 40 other movies are wrong. He has made one movie 40 times. He has used 40 different titles and 40 different sets of details and perhaps 200 different actors (some of whom he recycles from movie to movie), but he has only ever used one plot. It's a huge mystery to me why people can't seem to see this. Every year he makes the same movie again; every year it's hailed as a new movie and nominated for a bunch of Oscars. Where is your head, America?

""Midnight in Paris"" is yet another iteration of the one-and-only Woody Allen movie. Slightly dorky guy (Owen Wilson) is in love with a woman much too beautiful for him (Rachel McAdams). He can't trust the relationship (she has bad friends, bad parents and bad values), so he goes to great lengths to sabotage it (obsessing about Paris, particularly Paris in the 1920s, to the point where he believes he can actually visit it. Can he really, or is he delusional? No one is really sure.).

There are charming things in this movie. Paris is charming. The conceit of meeting the great artists who ran in the same circles in Paris in the 1920s is charming. Some of the performances are charming. But unless you have never, ever seen a Woody Allen movie, or you've suffered one of those amnesia-inducing brain injuries common in movies, or you're such a Woody fanboy that you're willing to watch the same movie over and over again, there's no particular reason to see this one.",1329696000,6,1790,4.501538461538462
4841526,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" is a sweet and charming examination of romance--not only romance of the heart but also romance for the past. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a hack Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write serious literature. He and his fianc&eacute;e, played by Rachel McAdams, are visiting Paris to spend some time with her parents before they get married. Gil obviously adores Paris--as does Allen, who shoots it as lovingly as he shoots his own beloved Manhattan--and wonders whether he and his fianc&eacute;e should move there permanently. As he escapes his insufferable soon-to-be in-laws, Gil stumbles upon the Paris of the past he has romanticized so thoroughly and encounters F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and a host of other literary and artistic figures. He falls for the lovely Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and he is ultimately forced to reconcile his romances with his reality. Allen's script is, as we have come to expect, witty and insightful and intelligent, and the film itself will win you over with its charm and its honesty.",1329523200,2,1098,5.174157303370786

4841528,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight In Paris gains effectiveness by portraying the inner fantasies everyone has and putting boyish imagination to real life. The movie is really a dream where the main protagonist actually achieves his most desired fantasy of going back to the salon era in 1920's Paris. Typical of fantasy movies Gil is driven back in time by the fact he is in an unfulfilling relationship with predictable people surrounding him who can't possibly imagine what he aspires to. Because Gil is beset with such mediocrity in such an unjust way the gods of fate look down on him with pity and reward him by making him a welcome guest in a 20's Paris cultural and literary dream. Without spoiling the story Gil is confronted with a difficult choice between his new dream world and the present.

The movie is once again pure cinematic genius from Woody Allen. As usual, Woody's personality is so strong that he vibrates or radiates into the movie just by directing it. The actors are just an extension of Woody. It becomes obvious that Gil is just standing-in for Woody, so it's too bad Woody couldn't have been 40 again and played the role himself. There's artwork and nuance in how the movie subtly blends humor, intellect, common problems in personal relationships, the essence of Paris, and magical fantasy seamlessly. With Woody directing, the film almost becomes a canvas of sorts in itself of equal artistic texture upon which the movie is painted. If Woody specializes in capturing the zeitgeist of cities this time it's Paris' turn. Midnight gains warmth by having famous 1920's Paris figures cameo in a Woody Allen movie. Gil gets to walk with his gods and literary muses as their guest for a rare moment in time. I guess the lesson of the movie is that Gil will always have Paris, no matter what era.

4841530,4,B005MYEQ4U,"As Midnight in Paris starts Gil (Owen Wilson), an American scriptwriter is visiting Paris with his rich fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her very Republicans parents.

Gil and Inez do not agree in many things, not in the things that count, anyway, like where they'd like to live (Gil in Paris, Inez in California), what to do for work (Gil wants to write a novel, Inez wants him to write scripts for Hollywood movies), or how interesting is Paul, the pseudo intellectual American friend they meet in Paris by chance. They definitely do not agree on where to spend their nights. Gil loves walking around, especially in the rain. Inez wants to go dancing, especially with Paul.

And so it is that during his walks, one night, Gil is transported to 1920s Paris where the likes of Scott Fitzgerald and his moody wife Zelda, Hemingway, Pablo Picasso and Gertrude Stein rule.

How this happens and how Gil returns to the XXI century in the morning and then again to the past every night we never know. Not that it matters, because the magic of Paris works on the viewer as it does on the confused protagonist and I, for one, was happy to follow him and witness his falling in love, in no particular order, with the 20s, a girl from the past, and the city of Paris.

As they say, it's complicated. I have truly disliked Allen's personal arrangements with his daughter and the fact that until now, he seems to have no time for black people in his film.

Woody Allen doesn't have much to say--and what he did say was better said by Fitzgerald: you can't recreate and live in the past. And his name-dropping in the movie was just as pretentious (and pedantic! overused word) as Michael Sheen's character's.

The characters were caricatures of themselves, though often funny.  Hemingway was a stand-out. Rachel McAdam's character was so nasty and shrewish, you couldn't figure out why Gil (Owen Wilson) would ask her out on a second date, let alone want to marry her.

4841550,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Story focuses on a man and his fiance' who are experiencing Paris in very different ways. The man, played by Owen Wilson, longs to be in the Paris of the 1920s when future big time writers were cross pollinating their artistic ideas amidst flamboyant parties, intellectual discourses and smokey cafes. But his unlikable, pretentious fiance, played by Rachel McAdams, is all about the money and her parents show you how she came to be that way. The main character soon finds himself whisked off to a magical place every day at midnight in which he meets all of his artistic heroes from the 1920s who go about helping him get out of his writing funk (he's a successful screenwriter trying to become an artistic novelist) yet when he returns to the present time he finds himself surrounded by non supportive people so he soon finds himself longing for the night. There are some interesting themes in this tale focused on nostalgia, modernism, why art matters, intellectualism and of course the magic of Paris. Owen Wilson does an admirable job channeling the Woody Allen persona. It was nice to see Kathy Bates in the film (as Gertrude Stein and Gil's writing mentor) as well as Adrien Brody (who played Dali) and Corey Stoll (as Hemingway). Bit of French trivia: the tour guide, Carla Bruni, is the wife of the French Prime Minister.

The central theme of the movie is the human nostalgia for a Golden Age.  Even though this longing is doomed because no Golden Age exists, the ideal elevates the longing for a Golden Age beyond mere nostalgia into a dream that makes everyday reality more beautiful and meaningful.  For me, the romantic longing to live in the same Paris with Hemingway and Fitzgerald, two tragic and brilliant figures, permits me to understand, as most viewers will understand, the powerful desire to visit this Golden Age of creativity and beauty.  Like his other poem of love, ""Manhattan,"" Mr. Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" perfectly captures the beauty and romance of a magical city that is more than a city:  it is the realization of our longing for perfection, which, sadly, we will never achieve.

I refrained from criticizing Owen Wilson at first due to his rumored suicide attempt; but, could it be that that is why some people actually voted for him? Seriously, (because it was not his acting that dragged this movie down Wilson actually showed some elan and was the only memorable character (but, to what end?) -- it was all of the above).

The Ugly American Family's daughter, Wilson's character's fiancee, went on so long in her one-note blandness and flat, insensitive awfulness that we wanted to shoot her -- again, director/writer's fault).

.  Th e magical '20s artists were so hackneyed and boring that only the very unread young could be interested in each one as he/she appeared. Sophomoric all around, characters as written, and audience members who voted for them.

Typically high cinematographic values.

4841564,4,B005MYEQ4U,"""Mahnattan"" was my favorite Woody allen movie, but I think ""Midnight in Paris"" has just taken top place in my book. It is Woody allen at his finest, a quirky, intellectual, weird and wonderful film. I bought this DVD from Amazon as soon as it was available, after having seen it in the movie theatre. Wonderful scenes of Paris, present and past, and an eccentric assortment of characters. You will come out of this movies smiling. It has a very liberal viewpoint, so some people won't like it.",1327968000,2,493,4.613636363636363

4841566,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's kind of like black coffee. Either you love him or you keep a decaffeinated distance. He's never dished blockbuster helpings, which obviously implies that most moviegoers haven't taken the time to encounter him. I suspect Midnight in Paris will be an exception to the rule. If you're curious but ultimately intimidated to scoop Allen's macaroni salad onto your cinematic cafeteria plate, then Paris is a thoughtful starting point.

Owen Wilson plays a successful yet unsatisfied go-to Hollywood scriptwriter with a Beverly Hills home and beautiful fianc&eacute;e whose future business minded in-laws can't perceive his soul's ambitions apart from seven digit paychecks. So begins the films initial conflict when Wilson's only desire is to abandon scriptwriting, move into a Paris studio and polish up his first independent novel.

Here's his handicap. Wilson's a romantic. He believes Paris' nineteen-twenties past is superior to his twenty-first century present. So begins solo late night walks, and unmistakably when the magic happens. I think most viewers will criticize his unbelieving fianc&eacute;e and in-laws for not taking lamp-lit strolls with him, but Wilson's a writer. The magic, and his eventual rebirth, as proposed in Midnight, could only happen in the alleyways of his solitude.

4841569,5,B005MYEQ4U,"WARNING: I GIVE YOU HEAVY CLUES/HINTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT MIDNIGHT WHICH TAKES PLACE EARLY IN THE FILM. I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS TO BE A ""SPOILER"" BUT OTHERS MIGHT.

The film opens with a lengthy jazz tune while showing us the splendor, romance, and fantasy of Paris to set the mood. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a role Woody Allen wrote for his alter-ego. He is a Hollywood hack writer wanting nothing more than to be a struggling novelist living in Paris in the 1920's. He is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams). Like Woody's other main characters, he recognizes when people are pretentious and pseudo-intellectuals such as Inez's friends. This is a running theme in his productions either in front of or behind the camera. Hint: If you couldn't understand why Allen is a genius from his other films, feel free to skip this one.

Gil desires to move to Paris. Inez is somewhat Republican and can't imagine living anywhere but the USA. One evening the two couples are out. Three of them want to go dancing while Gil does not. Instead he opts to take a nice leisurely stroll back to the hotel. Unfortunately he didn't drop any bread crumbs and like too many Americans in Paris he doesn't speak French so he can't ask for directions. (If you have ever been to Paris you know all those French can speak English, but won't because they enjoy watching us struggle with their language.)

Then at midnight...Allen creates a whole movie around one of his old stand up comedy bits come to be known as ""The Lost Generation"" [...] which goes like this:

""I mentioned before that I was in Europe. It's not the first time that I was in Europe, I was in Europe many years ago with Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway had just written his first novel, and Gertrude Stein and I read it, and we said that is was a good novel, but not a great one, and that it needed some work, but it could be a fine book. And we laughed over it. Hemingway punched me in the mouth.

""That winter Picasso lived on the Rue d'Barque, and he had just painted a picture of a naked dental hygenist in the middle of the Gobi Desert. Gertrude Stein said it was a good picture, but not a great one, and I said it could be a fine picture. We laughed over it and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.

""Francis Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald came home from their wild new years eve party. It was April. Scott had just written Great Expectations, and Gertrude Stein and I read it, and we said it was a good book, but there was no need to have written it, 'cause Charles Dickens had already written it. We laughed over it, and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.

""That winter we went to Spain to see Manolete fight, and he was... looked to be eighteen, and Gertrude Stein said no, he was nineteen, but that he only looked eighteen, and I said sometimes a boy of eighteen will look nineteen, whereas other times a nineteen year old can easily look eighteen. That's the way it is with a true Spaniard. We laughed over that and Gertrude Stein punched me in the mouth.""

Light, funny, entertaining...a romantic comedy by a stretch of the definition.",1327881600,,3075,4.449378330373002
4841570,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Of course the movie is perfect! Woody Allen at his finest...and with someone in ""his"" role who is much more visually appealing! If you're a Paris nut/Francophile, you will love the wonderful shots of Paris, night and day...it so made me want to go back. It's very entertaining, clever, witty, and sharp.
The quality of the DVD is poor. I sent my first one back, thinking it must be that one. The light was very yellow, casting a yellow tinge over everything, making it look like film and not real. So disappointing. When the replacement arrived, alas!, it was the same poor lighting, yellow cast. I got used to it after awhile, but it was not at all the quality of the original movie.",1327881600,,684,4.524193548387097
4841571,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Owen Wilson is wonderful as Woody Allen's stand-in, in this comedy of a young couple in Paris who have much different priorities.  He is entranced by Paris and it's history of attracting writers and philosophers.  His character is what Woody Allen played on-screen in his younger days, and Wilson pulls it off perfectly.  His fiance (the ever attractive Rachel McAdams), conversely, wants to shop, party and dance.  He gets tired of hanging out with her wealthy, consumerist parents and their pedantic know-it-all snob friend played expertly by Michael Sheen.  (BTW Sheen's character is just the sort of funny and pompous character that Woody Allen excels at putting in his movies, which you don't find in films done by virtually any other director.)

Wilson starts wandering around late at night and stumbles into a magical spot in the city where he gets a ride from an old-style limo, and the mystical fun begins, with his trips back to the twenties, meeting Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein etc.

Leave it to Allen to craft a light comedic movie that blends the life of the modern leisure class with 1920's nostalgia and intellectualism, all in a nice packet of personalities, with a dose of romance and magic thrown it.  I highly recommend it for a bit of light-hearted escapism.  As for its PG-13 rating, I really can't remember why it wouldn't be rated just a PG.  I would say that it is for adults mainly because of its intellectual and historical tone, but it's more family-friendly than many other movies with the PG-13 label (contrast with some PG-13s like 1408, Morning Glory, The Ring etc).",1327795200,2,1616,4.886446886446887
4841572,4,B005MYEQ4U,"This movie is beautifully filmed and really brings Paris to life. It makes you want to go visit. The historical ""time travel"" that Owen Wilson's character takes every night is like a revisiting old novels and history books about artists who made history. It is not a great love story, but Woody Allen's movies are most often about people becoming disconnected from each other and looking for a way to connect to themselves. His character Gil is no exception. He is a Hollywood screenwriter who is looking to write a novel and find inspiration in Paris. But, his fiance(Rachel McAdams)wants to marry Gil as successful screenwriter, not a struggling writer, and she ends up having a affair while Gil is off each night looking for love, inspiration or both.

You just don't get this type of beautiful cinematography combined with this throwback sensibility and it's romantic, but not cheesy, and perfectly cast...

You know, I'm a lover of Casablanca and Sabrina and all of these classic romances, and man, Woody Allen has outdone himself on this one.  I just can't recommend it highly enough, it's wonderful.

I guess I should at least say that it's a bit of a chick flick, and maybe men won't appreciate it so much, but it was good enough that it compelled me to come write a review just to encourage people on the fence to watch it.

To my very pleasant surprise, I absolutely loved this film!  It was whimsical, funny and clever.  In essence, it covers a trip to Paris by an engaged American couple played by Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams.  Despite being engaged, they are quite different people. She is the sometimes petulant daughter of her whining parents who are travelling with the couple.  Owen Wilson as Gil, is a Hollywood screed writer who dreams of writing a great novel and longs to live in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s.  A time when Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in the city and mixed with Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Paul Gaugin and others.

The trick that Allen uses to enhance the story is that each evening, Gil is actually able to travel back in time. He meets and mixes with his heroes.  Perhaps this sounds absurd but Allen manages to pull it off.  The result is very funny.  No one from the 1920s suspects that Gil is a traveller from another time although his fianc&eacute;e and parents think he must be crazy.  He must be delusional.

If the film has any message it is that people often yearn for earlier times.  We all speak of the good old days.  However, the good old days were rarely good.  Even Gil can identify that in the 1920s there were no antibiotics. For all its romance, earlier times were not without there drawbacks.

I thoroughly recommend this film.  Owen Wilson as Gil is a revelation and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is terrific.  This is a top piece of modern cinema.",1327276800,3,1706,4.586092715231788

Walking the streets of Paris one night, Gil begins an amazing journey into the 1920's where he meets some of the greatest literary and artistic minds of that era.  Ernest Hemingway, F.

4841603,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I haven't seen a Woody Allen film that blew me away since ""Radio Days"" ('87). Woody has given up on his idea of promoting New York City, and has drifted to Europe. He apparently has found new inspiration with Paris. This lovely fantasy serves him well with the history and its potential. His customary love of music is period-perfect, and the cleverness of the script is a testament that this man's creativity still thrives.

Owen Wilson whines mercilessly at the beginning, and Rachel McAdams is as vapid a rich-bitch as can be, but once Wilson finds his inspiration, he embraces it without reservation, indeed, accepting that he was born at the wrong time. The characterizations are good, and there are enough surprises along the way to make this a most enjoyable romp.

I don't understand how the Indie Spirit awards work, since Woody wasn't mentioned at all, and the guy who plays Hemingway was nommed for Supp Actor (he was very fine), the film's only nom.

I'm glad to have seen this film, and, with the exception of ""Vicky C.B."", Woody hasn't entertained me as much in many years. It also might be Woody's largest ensemble cast, and all succeed.

It's like eavesdropping on the imperfections of humanity.  It works for the right movie and Midnight in Paris is one of them.  I'm also wondering if it's possible that those of us who enjoyed this movie are also those who have often contemplated having been born in the wrong period of history?  Perhaps we have an affinity with that facet of imagination, but that is another discussion entirely.  I'm curious, how many of us have watched Gad Elmalch movies???  ONLY Gad could end up in the period of history in which he did!  That was hilarious.  But you would have to watch Gad's movies to get it.  Anyway, whether we loved the movie or hated it, I hope all of us at some point in life find our walk in the rain...",1327104000,3,1405,4.627530364372469

It's no coincidence that Paris has been such a center of cultural ferment.  It's as if a magnetic force draws the most creative and quirky literary and artistic figures there.  Unlike many other places that are dominated entirely by powerful institutions, Paris is a place where such ""nobodies"" as Mogdiliani and Hemingway found their true place in the world.  Owen Wilson's character goes through his own inner transformation through the City of Light.

4841616,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I love Woody Allen.  He has such a delightful way of crafting his comedic adventures into something so thoughtful and provoking, without ever feeling heavy handed or manipulative.  He allows his characters to speak for themselves and their situations to come alive within a realm of awkward realism.

`Midnight in Paris' has many of the same qualities that make Allen's filmography so impressive, but it lacks some of the internalized charm I was hoping for.  The performances are mostly uniformly great, with a few standouts, and the overall feel to the film is certainly effervescent in the way that most `great' Woody Allen films are, but there is a filmy layer of forcefulness that I didn't expect nor did I truly love.  Instead of allowing us to take from this film what we needed to take from it, Allen told us what we needed to glean, thus taking a little away from the film's actual impact.

In `Midnight in Paris', we are introduced to a young couple on the cusp of marriage.  They are drastically different individuals.  Inez is self-centered and condescending and materialistic and Gil is a dreamer with his head in the clouds and his eyes set on a fantasy idea of what life should be like.  Inez and Gil accompany Inez's parents to Paris for a business venture.  Inez is more concerned with eating at posh restaurants and buying overly priced lawn furniture, while Gil just wants to soak in the beauty of the city.  Gil is obsessed with the past, the nostalgic feeling of a time lost to him because he is simply not content with what he has.  He is convinced that yesteryear was so much better than the time and place he dwells in now.  While spending time alone, the clock strikes midnight and Gil finds himself transporter to 1920's Paris, a time he often fantasized about living in, where he meets the likes of Fitzgerald and Hemingway and soon falls for a beautiful woman who has a thing for tortured artists.  Living in this fantasy deep into the early morning hours and then struggling to connect with his fianc&eacute;e during the day, Gil uncovers the truth about his wanderlust and begins to understand his relationship with Inez for what it really is.

A mess.

The acting is pretty good.  Owen Wilson basically plays Woody Allen and he does so with mixed results.  His soliloquys are somewhat misdirected and feel awkward, and not in the comedic way that Woody pulls them off, but he really captures the awestruck feelings thrust upon Gil.  Rachel McAdams plays a pretty horrible person, and she does so with a finesse was wasn't expecting.  Michael Sheen is a clich&eacute; and not as funny as I wanted him to be.  Marion Cotillard is mesmerizing as the alluring love interest for Gil, but it is Corey Stoll who steals the whole show as the boozing, self-obsessed, prolific Earnest Hemingway.

My issues with `Midnight in Paris' lay with the script, which is surprising since it's Woody Allen and it's been winning award after award.  The script pushes Gil's personal views in a way that are consuming.  It is the only viewpoint expressed and it is done so rather heavy handed like.  The other thing that bothered me was that everyone in Gil's life was so different than him, so awful and unlikable that it made zero sense that he was even living the life he was living.  How did he end up with these people when he hates them and they obviously abuse him too often?  I also found parts of the film lazy, especially when you consider how Gil comes across a certain diary.

Alas, Woody still knows how to create an air that is engulfing, and his recreation of 1920's Paris is charming to the hilt.  Whenever Gil is dwelling in that world, `Midnight in Paris' is a total keeper.  This just feels like two films trying to live cohesively, and it can't wholly.",1326844800,,3780,4.649096385542169
4841617,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen has obviously matured and learned to pull himself to center between his extremes in the past with this one.  His Golden Globe for best screenplay was well deserved.  This film was recommended to me by several people who, like me, had reservations about ""another Woody Allen movie,"" but were all delightfully surprised.  I was not disappointed either.  Woody's portrayal of human angst was again evident, but employed in a more sophisticated manner so as to elicit joy and hope rather than cynicism.  Owen Wilson surprised me as well with a much more sincere performance than usual.  Under Allen's direction, Wilson boyishness and bent for comedy were tamed and honed to bring richness to his character rather than silliness.  In short, this was one of the most all around satisfying movies I've seen in a long time.  It left me uplifted to feel that the cinema might again renew my faith in their ability to bring clean, honest, positive and thoughtful entertainment back to the screen.  I was left, as a viewer, with a sense of having been transported to somewhere quite magical that I hope to again revisit. Definitely five stars.",1326844800,3,1144,4.8860103626943
4841618,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This movie is refreshing.  Many of Allen's recent films have been loaded with his adolescent sexual fantasies - and it is nice to have him return to what he does best, neurotic comedy.  The casting was perfect- Owen Wilson skillfully embodies his character.  I couldn't think of a better person to fill the role.  While those familiar with the literary greats he encounters will appreciate this best, finally there is a Woody Allen movie that all ages can appreciate.",1326844800,4,467,4.8734177215189876
4841619,2,B005MYEQ4U,"**This review may contain spoilers""

There's an old Twilight Zone episode, a fantasy-drama called 'The Trouble with Templeton' which came out during the iconic show's second season.  It's a similar concept to 'Midnight in Paris'.  Templeton is a fading stage director who believes that his glory days were back in the 20s and gets the opportunity go back there and learn an important lesson.  Unlike the Twilight Zone episode, Woody Allen's story is more of a romantic comedy.  It features Owen Wilson as a hack Hollywood screenwriter who aspires for more as a high brow novelist.  Wilson is the protagonist, Gil,  who's vacationing in Paris with his fiancee and her parents.  Wilson delivers many of Woody Allen's expressions in the same way as 'The Master' and that's probably why Woody praises him vociferously during the news conference extra in the DVD bonus section.

As in many other Woody Allen films, the protagonist is friendly with another couple, with the male partner depicted as a pretentious intellectual.  Woody also gets his ubiquitous digs in at right wingers, making jokes at the Tea Party's expense, through the mouth of the father-in-law to be, a corporate executive who decidedly is in the Republican camp.  As usual, Woody's protagonist must move on from a failed relationship with a woman at the end; in this case, it's the fiance, Inez, perkily played by Rachel McAdams.

The central conceit of 'Midnight in Paris' is Gil's time traveling back to the 1920s in Paris.  Woody doesn't come up with a very clever mode of transport: a limousine from the 20s appears out of the blue at midnight on a Parisian street and whisks our protagonist back to those heady days where he runs into the likes of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.

During the news conference on the DVD, Woody makes it clear that his intent is to satirize the artistes who Gil runs into.  At first, it's rather neat to watch a perennially intoxicated Zelda Fitzgerald do her thing as well as listen to Cole Porter at at the piano, but soon we realize that Woody has little to say about these iconic figures.  Hemingway isn't very amusing blathering about all his macho concerns and Picasso shows up merely as a buffoon, seducing one woman after another.  Adrien Brody tries his best to suck out humor from a pretentious Salvador Dali but ultimately is unable to come up with anything funny.  There's a brief, slightly humorous bit where Gil suggests to the surrealist film director, Bunuel, the concept for his classic picture, ""The Exterminating Angel"", with the exasperated director rejecting it since he tells Gil that it doesn't make any sense.  Kathy Bates has little to do as Gertrude Stein, except offering her critique of Gil's new manuscript.

A good part of 'Midnight' has to do with Gil's infatuation with Adriana, one of Picasso's cast-offs.  When Gil finds Adriana's autobiography at a bookseller in the present, he learns that he gave her a pair of earrings back in the 20s. This leads to an awkward scene where he attempts to steal Inez's earrings in order to fulfill the prophetic passage in Adriana's book. Gil is interrupted by Inez and her parents, who have returned to the hotel room after the father has some kind of heart scare.  Gil's machinations, attempting to prevent Inez from discovering that he stole the earrings, don't cut it since he could have avoided the whole predicament by buying earrings for Adriana at a store the next day (and that's what predictably transpires!).

Gil finally learns an important life lesson that living in the past is useless when he joins Adriana in traveling back to her golden age of the 1890s.  Back in the 20s, Hemingway speculates that Inez has been cheating on Gil, who confronts her when he returns to the present time.

'Midnight in Paris' is watchable but I guarantee you'll forget about this film after a few days.  Please note that Lea Seydoux is sensational as Gabrielle, the bookseller babe that Owen Wilson walks off into the sunset with at film's end!",1326672000,6,4033,4.8425655976676385
4841620,5,B005MYEQ4U,I have yet to view this DVD but have heard wonderful things about it from my daughter who has seen it during her Christmas visit with us . I received the movie in a timely manner and have a hunch I'm going to love it!,1326672000,2,217,3.8444444444444446
4841621,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Now, a lot of the people who gave this film a negative review accused the film of things such as: too many cliches or being too predictable, or even being boring, nothing could be further from the truth,  I assure you.  If you're looking for a romantic comedy to vegetate in front of, this isn't your movie, however in your case, I'd recommend ""Hitch.""  If you're willing to think, you'll find this movie to be fantastic.  It's not filled with cliches, and I refuse to believe otherwise for sheer lack of compelling evidence of any cliches at all within the film.  Now, is it going to be completely original?  No, but nothing is.  Anyway, enough rambling.

The plot centers around Gil, a struggling writer, who is visiting Paris with his fiance.  Gil longs to live in the Paris that existed in the 1920s; one of his fiance's friends refers to that as ""golden age thinking"" this is crucial to the message of the film.  Shortly after arriving in Paris, Gil takes a walk in an effort to formulate ideas for a novel, and finds himself standing in an empty Paris street, at midnight.  A 1920s model of whatever car (they mention it in the film) pulls up and whisks Gil away to the Paris of his dreams.  Throughout the story Gil meets people such as: Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, and a woman whose dream is to live in 1890s Paris.  Soon enough Gil and this woman are whisked away to 1890s Paris where he meets more notable characters (I apologize, for not remembering all of their names) who all wish to live in past eras themselves.  The woman Gil is with, wants Gil to stay there with her, never going back to the 20s.  This is where Gil learns, that the number off the year is not what makes an era great, but that the people who live in an era are what make it great.  That's the message of the film, that and obviously: follow your dreams, as it's Gil's dream to write and live in Paris.  Anyway, just to wrap up the story, Gil returns to Paris, calls off his wedding so that he can live and write in Paris, and then meets a new woman.

I didn't see many problems with the script; there are some pointless references to the tea party movement and the right wing in general, which Woody seems to have included simply for, well no reason at all, hence my labeling it a pointless reference.  Also when references like that are made the acting reduces itself to a kind of text-to-speech quality; in other words, I'm just not convinced that the characters actually believe these things.  The Hemingway character comes on just a little strong in the beginning, indicating a slight bout of overacting.  Kathy Bates was excellent, Adrian Brody was excellent (I've got no idea why some people are railing against his performance) and Owen Wilson, despite a few bumps, was fantastic.  All in all a great film, but remember, watch it; don't just gloss over the surface and expect yourself to get it, you won't.",1326585600,3,2962,4.51782363977486
4841622,2,B005MYEQ4U,"The concept was a novel idea as I can relate being in love with the WWII era here in the states in contrast to Gil's (Owen Daniel)fascination with the 1920's in Paris, France; however, there was no substantial development in the psyche and desire for this infatuation. It was not believable, mainly due to a poor performance by Owen who should stick to the more traditional comedies and by the way this was at no point a comedy and should not be regarded as such.

The movie approaches this gimmick with a lighthearted excitement and at first I was happy to be along for the ride.  The famous writers we encounter, especially Stein and Hemingway, keep the pacing strong and the audience amused.  Still, there is no escape from the utter lack of chemistry between Wilson and Cotillard, or their boring characters.

4841627,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Allen finally got away from his moronic, infantile stereotypically safe rom-com formula scripts - OK, mostly. Acting for the most part was quite good especially the French actors but Wilson behaved more like a comic book author than anything more literate. The tete-a-tetes with the early 20th, late 19th century authors and artists was an off-the-wall creative view of their unembellished lives. Cinematography was great; props, settings and especially costuming were very great. Just how we ended up in these periods actually didn't really matter which is testimony to the fine directing, writing and acting. The viewer at first asks themselves if it's a Cinderfella fantasy, or parallel dimensional time travel, or psychological disorder, or an illusion but all that becomes a trivial sideshow to the endless enjoyable interactions. Personally, I would have had the script focus less on Gil's comical behavior and more on the potpourri of characters he meets.",1326412800,,962,5.377483443708609
4841628,1,B005MYEQ4U,"I was looking for a light comedy or drama for my wife and I to enjoy on a friday night after the kids went to bed.  We reviewed the trailer and while not blown away, it seemed to fit the bill.  30 minutes in, however, we found it to be a hodge podge of other movie plots, loosely stuck together with a few clever lines and cliched pre-wedding scenarios.  I feel terrible for Kathy Bates, who is a well known and talented actress, her character seemed more of an after thought and she had no opportunity to shine.  The main character had plenty of opportunities, but left them on the floor...most likely with a lot of other useless film they had to cut to fit this into a reasonable viewing time.

My wife later told me she thought it was meant to be oriented more towards women, but found nothing to relate to...but she stopped watching half-way through.

The old saying, ""The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence"" applies to this movie. We all tend to have nostalgic feelings, probably misplaced and skewed, of a time in the past; either our own past or further back, when things were better. The main character gets the chance to find out for himself...

I'd recommend getting this in Blue Ray - a few of the night scenes; including smokey bars, are a bit hazy plus I'd just like to see the beauty of Paris in the highest clarity possible.

Also, keep a cultural dictionary or encyclopedia (or have Wikipedia ready on your laptop): You are going to hear a lot of artists (painters, singers, writers, movie producers, musicians, etc.) mentioned that unless you are an Art Major, will leave you wondering, ""Where have I heard that name before?""",1326326400,2,1001,4.6440677966101696

4841633,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight in Paris is not one of Woody Allen's 'bigger, serious' films. It is a small delight not meant to discover any epiphanies or push any agenda social or otherwise. It is about the love of Paris, Art and the 1920's and as a love letter to those three things it works very, very well.

Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a man visiting Paris with his fiancee and her parents. Gil is a writer, a lover of Paris and a romantic who idealizes the life of the expatriate American artists and writers who so famously colonized Paris in the 1920's. It becomes clear early on that Gil and his intended are an ill-assorted couple, even to the point that they don't want to do the same tourist activities. There are deeper issues as well. Gil wants to quit Hollywood screenwriting and pursue novel writing, preferably in Paris. Inez, his girlfriend wants him to continue doctoring scripts so that they can afford eighteen thousand dollar chairs for their projected house in Malibu. One night Gil's fiancee goes dancing with other friends and Gil gets lost in the twisty streets of Paris. A mysterious vintage car stops and its inhabitants invite him to a party. It is some invitation as the party is in the Paris of the 1920s and with the artists that Gil so loves.

What follows is a loving romp through that time period and to Gil's ultimate realization of how he should live his life. Even the character says that these are only minor insights. However, Allen's artistry and experience really show in every aspect of the movie. Paris is lovingly shot and the Lost Generation is wonderfully portrayed. As the theme was nostalgia and its dangers, I must in all honesty say that this movie had similarities to an earlier work of Allen's, The Purple Rose of Cairo, which also features the imaginary becoming real. I saw that movie in a theater when I was twelve years old and that movie enchanted me then as this movie enchants me now. Recommended but don't expect a major work like Match Point; this is a wonderful minor work.

The one criticism I had is that Owen Wilson and his fiancee seemed a little old for the time in life they were portraying. People pushing 40 are generally not on their first marriage or if they are not so influenced by the opinions of their parents. Actors and actresses in their twenties for the part of Gil and Inez would have worked much better.",1326240000,3,2365,4.57311320754717

The main characters just argue their way through the movie. Boring! The characters from the 20's were dealt with in cliches. The Hemingway character was over blown. The Owen Wilson character loves his girl friend, but then jumps to a girl from the past then switches to yet another woman at the end and this is supposed to be romance? Dull and contrived.

At any rate, the beauty and charm of the City of Lights would still be hypnotic even if there had been no music.

This time-travel fantasy was enjoyable, though I could see why some people wouldn't think so. The artsy in-jokes thrown in by Allen would fly over the heads of many who weren't familiar with the writings of T. S. Eliot or the paintings of Salvador Dali, among others.

As he has done in other movies, Allen poked fun at pseudo-intellectuals having Paul (Michael Sheen) believing himself to be an ""expert"" in just about everything, e.g., art, architecture, wine.

I was so looking forward to finally seeing Midnight in Paris, after I had read and heard so much about it. I found it a disappointment, mainly because it was just what I had expected and nothing more. There is so much more to the real Paris, not just the standard sights and conceptions and obsessions with impressionism, post-impressionism, the early modern writings of Americans who went to Paris to write and drink during Prohibition. All the cliches are there and there is nothing new, not even the concept of falsely worshipping the past. The past is distorted here in so many ways. First, just when in the 1920s is that part of the film set? Fitzgerald, Hemingway (did he really talk like that?), Picasso, Bunuel, Degas, Matisse, Modigliani, Dali, Josephine Baker and just about everyone else Woody Allen could come up with in the film and all at the same time in that decade:  oh look, there's so and so and then there's so and so. The female extras wear styles of the early 20s, all except for the childish character of Marion Cotillard who wishes only to go back to La Belle Epoque. She isn't even wearing an authentic late-20s dress, it's too short (again a false cliche) and is really something from today (today being defined as the still-1960s lasting 40 years after its zenith). The 1890s folk at Maxims (Degas, was it?) comment on how pretty the dress was -- she would have been arrested or at least asked to leave Maxims for wearing it then. Instead she's offered a designing job. After all, didn't she assist Chanel thirty years in the future? And do we always need a cliche cancan? And what is with that hearse that comes to pick little Marion up? How were her memoirs published and why? That may be the low point of the movie. I was embarrassed for Cotillard because she had been so wonderful as Edith Piaf and she ends up in this junk. And the tune Parlez-moi d'amour played repeatedly at the end ... it was written in 1930 (look it up on Wikipedia). Now for Owen Wilson, who acts here so much like Woody Allen himself that he must be his alter ego. Wilson says in the Cannes interview on the disc that Allen left him alone to develop his own character. That is so hard to believe because he is imitating Woody Allen, with his whining and and confusion. This mirror portrayal is really spooky. Also, why do later disc boxes replace the Paris sky shown at first with Van Gogh's Starry Night and then add Rachel McAdams to Wilson's stroll along the Seine? Is she such a big star that Wilson needs her to sell the story? Allen said he wanted her because she was so beautiful and, oh year, also, a good actress, as is Wilson. If they truly are so great, it doesn't show up here. Her parents were the obnoxious right-wing cliches. Carla Bruni is a stick, physically and in her ""acting"". Pure vanity. Kathy Bates' Gertrude Stein was the highlight of the film, as she often is, and lent a little class to this mess.",1325721600,10,2953,4.4972067039106145

The Americans are so American, the portrait of the young artist is such a great portrait, Zelda, Hemingway, Dali, Toulouse Lautrec are so much who we believe them to be that one feels that one is in a Comedia Del Arte play without the costumes. And one loves it, loves it enough to watch the film multiple times. For the cinema, for the director, for the acting, for the script, for the subject and for the overall joy and experience.

Owen Wilson was so very perfect in the role of the observer who has difficulty in really relating that I was reminded of the opening chapter of Anthony Burgess's ""Inside Mr. Enderby"" when Enderby the poet is visited by a group of time-traveling children with their tutor while he is sleeping. This time the people visited are not sleeping, but the traveler, Gil, is. Sleeping and dreaming or day-dreaming. The third time you watch the film, you start noticing the dream characteristics of locations, people, conversations, movements, props and possibly even the Cole Porter Songs. Maybe?

This is not Fantasy. Nor is it time travel. I am not too old to have forgotten the dreams of my childhood and youth.

4841654,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Spending some time overseas and being a fan of Woody Allen, I immediately was attracted to Midnight in Paris. Woody Allen is a master of emotional directing. Every movie of his has warmth that many directors seem to leave out or forget about. His movies are very real and we don't doubt what is happening, no matter what the situation is. He captures the character and finds ways for the viewer to relate and contrast to ourselves and what we've wanted or how we've felt.

Midnight in Paris is a very simple movie. As like other Woody Allen films you must be open minded and not get too wrapped up in scientific fact. Simply enjoy the film. This movie is very well designed and simply has a wonderful flow to it which makes it quite pleasing to the audience. I never really reached a slow down-point in this film where I was simply waiting for it to end. I was hooked from the beginning and was very fascinated throughout the film.

The Blu-ray is very nice looking and has a soft warm tone on the spectrum. This greatly complements the movie, as a cold sharp picture would completely have ruined the feel. The audio is clear however not as crisp as it could have been. Most of the movie is dialogue with times of music or simply sounds of the Parisian streets.

A very fun, highly recommended film. Art history buffs will love it, however everyday viewers will find it informative and interesting. Worth a rent at the very least. I am quite happy to have this in my collection.",1325548800,4,1478,4.466666666666667

This film is the definition of a wanna-be history buff attempting to reach an uneducated public who fantasize that Paris is the city of midnight with champagne flowing and scripted philosophy dripping from all martini glasses. How patronizing.
Just a few details that need substance are:
The constant binary between Paris and Los Angeles (Malibu this time).
The stereotyped programmatic characters
The music sounding more Spanish guitar than French.
The dumfus protagonist that can't be taken seriously.
The simple script, Hemingway's, a ""bathtub gin writer"" states ""I'm working on a novel""

Scott Fitzgerald, introducing his poorly acted drunken wife, Zelda...who states, ""my talent lies in drinking"".

What kind of books do you write? states Scott Fitzgerald character,
""We are all bored""....that goes for the audience as well.
Nobody questions 21st c clothes in early Paris?
The actor who plays Hemingway ""it was unfulfilled"" is unfullfilled as an actor. Terrible performance or directing?

The sets are dusty and sepia toned....costumes are stereotyped as well.

The whole sensibilty ...horse carriages ...smoking..... study of Coco Chanel....
Really? Did you miss adding any well-known artist? You compressed the greats inot sound-bytes that made each look idiotic including TS Elliott and his (pal?) Man Ray.

I gave it 4 Stars because everything else played out superbly.  Imagine how perfect the film would have been - with a talented actor playing the lead role.

I knew I had to see it - not only do I love Paris, I love movies that have a  feel for the city, like Amelie.  Knowing how well Woody Allen makes NY a character in his movies I knew this had to be good.

I picked up the Blu-Ray for my wife for Christmas and watched it last night. It was as fun as I remembered it being in the theater.  Maybe even more fun because I could stop and discuss the different references with my wife.  ""Who's that?""  ""Man Ray - he did avant-garde photography""  ""OK, I remember him.""  And there are quite a few references - unless you have spent your life studying the ex-pats in Paris in the '20s you couldn't catch them all in one sitting.

The plot is sort of silly and the characters a cliched, but the movie was so much fun that I didn't care.  Amazingly Owen Wilson played Woody Allen better than Woody can himself - his phrasing and everything was exactly Woody but without the whine - he is much more watchable.

And yes, Woody has a feel for Paris that rivals his feel for NY - it was like being back in the city again.  I know exactly what is around the next corner in every scene and can almost feel the breeze and smell the fresh baguettes...",1325376000,4,1320,4.141732283464567
4841663,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is a wonderful movie: charming, funny, pretty to look at and entertaining.  It does make a few demands on its audience, however, as do many of Allen's films. It helps to have some familiarity with the major cultural icons of the 19th and 20th centuries  -  all of them pretty familiar names, nothing really very obscure. Any kind of basic art history course and one in American literature would be plenty.  In fact, just knowing these artists and writers existed would probably be enough. It helps also if one can recognize obnoxious in-laws-to-be and not be offended by an accurate portrayal of them. A sense of humor helps as does an ability to sit back and enjoy oneself. With those minimal qualifications one would have to work pretty hard at it not to enjoy ""Midnight in Paris"". Allen deserves credit also for casting Owen Wilson in the lead; an unlikely choice, perhaps, but he does an excellent job. But Allen has always picked great casts; so it's not so surprising. [There are a couple of errors in the English subtitles: In Cole Porter's song, ""Let's Do It"", the O and the B in Oyster Bay should be upper case, and people from Latvia are called Letts, not Latts - that's part of the wordplay in the lyric.]",1325376000,5,1221,4.587155963302752

Another Woody homage to a city, opening with a series of lovingly, golden-basked shots of the streets of Paris.

OK, you know where it's going, you're not sure exactly how it's going to get there, but you get many fine actors and actresses clearly enjoying themselves portraying famous artists from Paris of the 20s. Marion Cotillard is particularly charming. Adrien Brody's five minutes as Salvador Dali is particularly funny. Somebody needs to make a movie about Gertrude Stein with Kathy bates as lead.

My experience of this film is of a beautifully presented love poem to Paris, lovely, delightful, introduced at its outset through sensitive cinematic portraits of the City accompanied by Sidney Bechet's affectionate call and response duet, gently carrying us along, saying, `Abide with me, Gentle Viewer - This is a love story'.

I understand that the story-teller's art may emphasize Plot, Character, or Setting, in any combination of related qualities, with blend and emphasis varying throughout the work.

While there is sufficient plot in this narrative to carry the armchair viewer along, I'm thinking that the story line in our film serves mainly as a supporting vehicle, providing a milieu lending meaning to the essential spirit of the piece: the author's delight in Paris, his desire to share his sense of wonder in the art, culture, history, the spirit of the city and its people.  Plot and Character are minimal interests here; this is a work celebrating its Setting, the Social and Cultural Environment of the City of Paris.

As an artist's purpose is through their craft to stimulate in the viewer, listener or reader an experience sympathetic with their own, often inspired in wonder, our author and director was thoroughly successful with me; I come from this experience now, in love with Paris.

4841673,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen once said: ""If my films don't show a profit, I know I'm doing something right"". And boy, is he ever right. Why would he want to settle on being an ordinary filmmaker, incapable of directing a film like this? Shudder to think!

It was this past summer that I visited the theatres to see this film at the urging of a friend. I have enjoyed most of the films he's done in the past 10 years, so I was game. I wasn't even half an hour in before I fell head over heels in love with this film.

First thing to note - the city of Paris is a character all its own. Glittering, beautiful, rich & elegant, Allen's cinematography brings the City of Lights to life. If you've ever been to Paris - or have longed to go like yours truly - watching this movie will make you want to return (or cash in your life savings to make the trek). Woody Allen has always had a long love affair with Paris, and his affection shows up in every shot of the city. Everything is awash with color and light. No washed out tones to be found anywhere.

Paris aside, the film is absolutely magical. Owen Wilson is an actor who has never appealed to me. I have routinely found his comedies lacking humor, substance and style, and he's never been believable to me. I was completely surprised to find him not only charmingly genuine here, but completely loveable and relatable. Rachel McAdams is always fabulous, and this movie is no exception. There are many other wonderful actors showcased, most of them being unknown. Two standouts are Alison Pill (an extreme talent - watch out for her) and Corey Stoll. I won't spoil the story by telling you who they play; that's half the fun. If you're like me, you'll watch it for the first time and squeal with delight with each character's reveal. Let's just say you might want to brush up on your literature and art history prior to watching the film. I must say that immediately after leaving the theatre, I was ready to book my Air France ticket. Then I was brought back to reality when my finances came up and bit me in the nose.

Well, I could go on and on, but I will spare you. Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie. If you're ok with suspending belief to enjoy a magical two hours, you will love it. If not, then you might as well numb your brain on another insipid, uncreative Hollywood big-box release.",1325203200,13,2338,4.34324942791762
4841674,5,B005MYEQ4U,"After an artistic and commercial surge that lasted from 1969's 'Take the Money And Run' through 1987's 'Radio Days,' Woody Allen's creative powers began to noticeably flag in the late 1980s. His comic films seemed repetitive and were no longer very funny, his dramas were murky and superficial, his productions began to look shabby (1993's thread-worn 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' being a good example) and, where Allen once commanded the finest acting talent the industry had to offer, his films began to be populated with second- and third-tier performers.

The Mia Farrow/Soon-Yi Previn scandal, which broke in the early 1990s, further alienated the general public, and, with the commercial failure of his projects, Allen began having trouble finding financing for his films.

Still, when Allen, who had rarely made a film outside of New York City, decamped to London to make 2005's critically and commercially successful crime drama 'Match Point,' New Yorkers were aghast, since they appeared to be losing their city's greatest ambassador. But Allen went on to celebrate the city of London in the mediocre 'Scoop' (2006) and both the underrated drama 'Cassandra's Dream' and the equally underrated comedic 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (2007 and 2010, respectively).

In between, Allen stopped over in Barcelona to film the internationally acclaimed comedy 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' a film which, as 'Match Point' had done for London, did for the Spanish city what Allen had done for New York City decades ago in 1979's 'Manhattan,' still one of the jewels in the crown of his career.

How wonderful for Allen, and for movie-lovers everywhere, that Allen, at present in his 70s, has now done the same thing for the French capitol with 2011's 'Midnight in Paris,' which, among things, is the first authentically warm film Allen has ever made.

There have been moments of human warmth in earlier Allen films (the poignant conclusion of 'Manhattan,' some of the scenes between Cecilia and Tom Baxter in 1985's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' or those between Eliot and Lee, or Mickey and Holly in 1986's 'Hannah & Her Sisters'), but 'human warmth,' as such, has never been very high on the list of subjects Allen has chosen to explore, despite his obvious romanticism.

The literally magical 'Midnight in Paris' has a very simple plot, a fact which works in the film's favor throughout: Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a successful Hollywood screenwriter who would actually prefer to be a successful novelist of literary merit, is visiting Paris with his beautiful but shrewish fianc, Inez (Rachel McAdams), and her wealthy, conservative, and materialistic parents. Enchanted by his knowledge of Parisian history and the Parisian streets themselves, Gil makes excuses and breaks away from Inez and her entourage.

Unable to find his hotel as midnight approaches, the slightly drunken Gil is picked up by a mysterious vintage automobile of boisterous bon vivants; before long, he finds himself drinking, dancing and conversing with F. Scott and Zleda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll, who steals the film with a dynamic and subtle performance), Gertrude Stein (a not very believable Kathy Bates), Djuna Barnes, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali (a hilarious Adrien Brody), and other literary and artistic legends in the distant Paris of the 1920s, a 'dream period' in which Gil imagines life would have been full of meaning, beauty, purpose, and endless, but realizable,  potential.

Finding himself cast adrift in the present again the following morning, Gil attempts to recreate and share his secret with Inez on the next evening, but vulgar and petulant Inez, bored with waiting, leaves before midnight, the magic hour in which the car appears to escort Gil into the past. In his nightly revels in 1920s Paris, Gil eventually falls in love with Picasso's mistress, Adrianna (a gently stunning Marion Cotillard), a woman who is as lovely in spirit as she is in person. Much to his surprise, however, Gil finds that Adrianna cares little for her own era and instead romanticizes turn of the century Paris---the Belle poque.

Unable to explain his preoccupied mental state or his midnight wanderings to Inez or her family, Gil, who thinks Paris looks best in the rain, takes again to the daylight Parisian streets, where he encounters young antiques dealer Gabrielle (La Seydoux) and strikes up a promising acquaintanceship, though Adrianna and the 1920s continue to haunt and lure him on.

Stunningly photographed by Darius Khondji, 'Midnight in Paris' not only ends warmly and happily, but the film is full of life, dimension, and figurative color to a degree never attempted in an Allen film.

Though Inez and her family, as types, have appeared recently in other Allen films, they are in no way the focus of the film: they are present merely to show what Gil has to fully realize and reject before he can move on with his life in a truly satisfactory manner. The script makes some rather lowly and cumbersome digs at the Republican party and the Tea Party movement, but the remarks, which flow from Gil's mouth, feel so tacked on and superfluous that they are easy to overlook.

Warm in tone and color, beautiful to look at, wonderfully written and acted (Owen Wilson is by far the best 'Woody Allen stand-in' since John Cusack), and powerfully scored and edited, 'Midnight in Paris' stands alongside 'Love & Death' (1975), 'Annie Hall' (1977), 'Interiors' (1978), 'Manhattan,' 'Stardust Memories' (1980), the underrated 'A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy' (1982), 'Broadway Danny Rose' (1984), 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' 'Hannah & Her Sisters,' 'Bullets Over Broadway' (1994), 'Match Point,' and 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona' as one of Allen's most creatively successful, joyous, and visionary films.

More than midway through the film, Allen has Gertrude Stein telling Gil that the artist's job is to provide meaning in a meaningless world, something 'Midnight In Paris' itself does in poignant and touching fashion.",1325203200,12,6031,5.159672466734903
4841675,1,B005MYEQ4U,UGH. Allen can do anything he wants and he has done genius work. Then there is this. Time travel as a plot device for self discovery? Romantic relationship nobody can possibly understand? Paris as a place to save it all? Sorry. Even Allen cannot get away with just about anything.,1325203200,12,280,4.62
4841676,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Let me begin by stating that I enjoyed this movie. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the arts (literature, painting, etc.) to see Midnight in Paris. It is a lovely romantic drama that provides an escape from our hectic workaday life.
The film opens with a montage of scenes of modern-day Paris, with music of the 1920s playing in the background, which seems just a little too long. The scenes are beautiful and the music hearkens back to a simpler, more romantic time, but the montage just went on too long.
The juxtaposition between modern day and Paris in the 1920s (Gil's ideal or Golden Age) was too vague. One of the main themes of the movie is Gil's longing for meaning in his writing career and nostalgia for the Golden Age (the good old days, Paris in the 1920s). For me, there was no difference in the feel of the modern day he magically escapes from and the period he is transported back to: just different clothes and technology and architecture. The film would have been more powerful if more of the ills of modern society (which every generation believes did not exist in the ""good old days"") were portrayed. The world which the main characters move through seems just as carefree and luxurious as the Golden Age which Gil longs for.
There is, however, a nice lesson in the film, learned by the characters, that the good old days were not necessarily so good to those who lived through them and that every generation longs for a simpler, better time.
The point at which Gil realizes that all these individuals (whom he believes at first to be modern people playing dress up and acting the part of characters from the Golden Age) are actually the real, living Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, etc. should be a defining and poignant moment in the film, yet it passes imperceptibly. One moment we know that Gil thinks he is in modern Paris, and then we realize Gil is convinced the characters are real, yet his demeanor and behavior don't really change. I don't know if this is a weakness in Owen Wilson's acting or the fault of the director/producer, but I never experienced that wonder that a person would experience when they realize,""This is not a dream, these are not quirky actors playing a trick on the public, I am really talking to literary and artistic giants who have been dead for many years."" I LOVE Owen Wilson, I'm just not sure he was the best choice for this role. His normal expression when the room is on fire is the same one he shows when he realizes he is in the company of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.
Allison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald stole the show. I felt like I was watching the real Zelda Fitzgerald. In contrast, Corey Stoll's performance as Ernest Hemingway was not very good, in my opinion. He  seemed to be a caricature of Hemingway. I felt like I was watching an actor trying to playing Hemingway. Kathy Bates turns in a terrific performance as Gertrude Stein.
Having said all that, let me say I did enjoy this movie. I think anyone who is a writer or artist, or enjoys literature and art, will enjoy this movie. I would not laud it as one of the best movies of all time, but I would consider it one of the best movies of the last few years.
I recommend (and this is a compliment about the movie) having your laptop at the ready to Google characters and book references if you are not extremely well-read in regards to the authors, artists, and influential figures in the artistic community in Paris in the 1920s (e.g. Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, etc.).
I guess in conclusion, I felt like the premise was so good, and there was so much potential in the idea, that I was disappointed in the final product which the producers produced. I had completely forgotten until I was finishing this review that Midnight in Paris was directed by Woody Allen. I'm sure that many people who rave over this movie have fallen into the trap of looking at art subjectively. Whether it is movies or books, we often tend to give more credit to the work of an artist who has produced great works in the past than the current individual piece deserves.

P.S.I gave this movie 4 stars, but I really wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars. The rating won't allow half stars, and I felt 3 out of 5 would have been insufficient. This is better than an average movie (3 stars), but I'm not sure it is 4 out of 5.",1325203200,2,4357,4.493064312736444
4841677,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Had the French Government wanted to create a ""love poster"" for the city of Paris they couldn't have done better than this wonderfully original film by Woody Allen. Every shot, every scene drips of Allen's obvious fascination with this city of culture and romance.

However, even though he could've stayed at that shining surface layer, Allen goes one deeper as he usually does in all his movies. By revisiting a topic that's dear to his heart, death and the meaning of our short existence on this planet, he takes us on a delightful philosophical journey sugar-coated as a romance story taking place in a gorgeous city.

The burning question posed in different ways throughout the film is this: what would it take to be happy while we're alive? Would we be happy if we were somehow transported to a ""better"" time and place? And what if, once we arrive there, we start to yearn for yet an older time and another place?! When would our excuses end and when would we start to love what we've got here and now?

This is a film that only Woody Allen could've pulled off. Whimsical, original, and adorned with frames that are shot like a dream. The romantic hit movie of the year that'll stay with you long after the pop-corn is gone.",1325203200,4,1228,4.572727272727272
4841678,3,B005MYEQ4U,"How many times can Woody Allen remake the same film?  Sure, different settings and character names but essentially they all seem to involve wealthy people whining about their lives.  In this version, Woody (as Gil Pender) ruminates about how he's not living his desired artistic life and sets up the usual set of foils, from the shrew of a wife he seems to have little real affection for to her evil parents who hate him and want to kill his free spirit.  There's the requisite pseudo-intellectual nemesis who casually belittles Woody (um, I mean Gil).  Whether his films are about murder, adultery or failed careers the dynamics and character archetypes are always consistent.  If you've seen one Woody Allen film since the 80's, you've truly seen them all.

Perhaps if you're an art and literature history buff, you may get a kick out of the portrayals of great artists of the 1920's (Hemingway, F Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, etc).  For me, the beauty of Paris and the reminiscing of an imagined grander age aren't enough to carry this film.",1325203200,7,1058,4.8121546961325965
4841679,4,B005MYEQ4U,"A charming stroll through a magnificent city and a wonderful age of larger than life personalities.  Thoroughly enjoyed.  However, definitely not for every taste.  You don't have to have been a literary major to enjoy, but if you're moderately well-read you'll certainly have added appreciation for how the film brings life to its characters.  I thought Owen Wilson was nicely matched to the material and plays his character wonderfully.  But again, if you're into shootouts, or car chases, or Ninjas, this is probably not your treat.  Just a delightful fantasy told with wit and grace.",1325203200,,586,5.11578947368421

What a waste of effort and money, bad casting, poor storyline, tokenism, weak charactors, etc and why, perhaps ""the emperor's clothes"" syndrome? First, the contemporary dialogue and story between the engaged couple and her parents is perhaps an Allen moment and probably one of a wasted effort, fast forward please. Most viewers will have no idea who the historical characters are and many of them just have a cameo appearance which seems too frivolous. I guess Allen wanted to make sure none of the deceased felt badly being left out! Hemingway came across as robotic and strong and Gertrude Stein weak and the rest of the characters were depicted as cartoons (Gauguin, Degas, Man Ray, etc). The scenery of Paris and the music have a redeeming effect for the movie but even the scenes are postcards with little depth. The golden atomsphere and lighting seemed too much since Paris is a city of white light. A year from now this will just be a footnote in Allen's resume collecting dust on a shelf.",1325203200,,1056,4.775956284153006
4841681,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Even at this late stage of his career, Woody Allen is capable of wringing a few surprises out of his trademark formula, and Midnight in Paris is a treat for Allen's fans and romantics alike, a comedy about wish fulfillment that's magical and touching. Owen Wilson stars as an aspiring novelist who, on a trip to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e, is transported back to the city's Jazz Age, sharing drinks with Salvador Dali, getting advice from Ernest Hemingway, and finding romance with a beautiful scenester But is our hero's idealized 1920s Paris all that it's cracked up to be?

4841688,2,B005MYEQ4U,"Nice scenes of Paris. I've never been there. Heard so many great things about this movie. I found it to be boring and sterile. Owen Wilson does whine a lot, and comes off as be an uninspiring, one dimensional, and wimpy figure. Within minutes of the opening of the film, Allen's ""neurosis"" pops out. It's the same old stuff - nothing really matters after all because everyone dies. World without hope or, in this film, struggling to find it. How many times can you beat a dead horse (no pun intended)? Allen needs to finally discover a higher power rather than resorting to fawning over notable, but always, defective mortals. The lost detective scene was the only rewarding moment in the entire film. Bring back Bananas.",1325030400,14,721,4.73015873015873
4841689,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's 2011 endeavor, Midnight in Paris begins similarly to what you would expect of a Woody Allen picture. Shots of Paris in the morning, quirky music, shots of Paris in the afternoon, music continues, shots of Paris in the evening... I think you can assume the rest. However with Paris in the spotlight instead of Allen's beloved New York, you might expect an obvious loss of affection or romanticism, however there is none at all which is first and foremost a fantastic breath of fresh air.

Our hero is Gil, that prototype Woody Allen, self-effacing and neurotic character we've come to know, lovingly played by a surprisingly well-suited Owen Wilson. As the story opens, we find Gil and his fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) in Paris, along with his less than enthusiastic future in-laws quite openly butting heads in the city he adores and she loathes. Gil is a Hollywood writer who longs to write something more meaningful and has begun on a novel about a man working in a nostalgia shop, selling relics of a more beautiful time past that Gil has yet to find the nerve to let another soul read.

Walking back from a wine tasting alone, it is than that magic happens to Gil when the clock strikes midnight and on the windy Parisian street ahead of him appears a gorgeous old car, that opens it's door for him and begins a trip to Paris in the 1920's that has Gil rubbing shoulders with the periods most beloved artists.

It is easy to say that this film is formulaic, however I beg to differ. I found this film to be without a doubt my favorite of this year, and possibly my new favorite Woody Allen film. (And I mean that Annie Hall!)

Owen Wilson is magnetic and enjoyable in a way I personally have never thought him to be, supported by a brilliant cast including the gorgeous Marion Cotillard, always brilliant Michael Sheen and Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway in a performance that absolutely elevated the entire film.

It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Midnight in Paris does something few other films have done by soloing out the true nature of everyone's desire to yearn to live in another time, to fantasize that we'd be happier and more well-suited there instead of where we happen to be. To see such a subject tackled without a shred of existential angst, instead that glimmer of understanding the need for escapism when we're afraid to face our own reality is nothing short of beautiful.",1324944000,4,2416,4.635514018691588

4841691,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Finally, after fifteen years of mostly spotty and seemingly hastily put together films, Woody seems to have invested more time and money in this one, and produced a winner.

The plot of 'Midnight in Paris' isn't particularly original, as Woody borrows from himself and others as he's prone to do.  But it's well crafted, well acted, and plain fun to watch.  'Midnight' is more reminiscent of his early ""classic"" period ('Play it Again Sam' thru 'Love and Death'), which had broader appeal than his later adult situation ""dromedys"", and more laughs.

Everything seems to hit here; his directing is tighter than it's been for a while, and the casting is superb.  No one could top Alison Pill's hilariously delightful portrayal of Zelda Fitzgerald.  If this isn't Zelda as she was, then it's how she should have been.  I don't know if Ms. Pill has enough screen time to merit Best Supporting Actor, but this performance will surely have producers calling.  She's already slated to appear in Woody's next film. (Unfortunately lead actor Owen Wilson's performance wanes in comparison, as he appears a bit out of his league, but given that is his character's role anyway it's not so detrimental to the film.)

Finally, there is absolutely nothing offensive here, and if your teenagers aren't familiar with the Lost Generation, or slogged and suffered through 'The Great Gatsby', then this should kindle their interest as a fun way to learn of that era.",1324944000,5,1446,4.9421487603305785

Marion Cotillard shines as the understated, beautiful muse of Picasso, you cannot help but fall in love with her. She is the epitome of Paris. Owen Wilson was his normal quirky self with wild dreams and was great throughout the film. I cannot imagine as a writer how fantastic it would be to be among some of the greatest writers/artist in history that set the scale, so to speak.

I have not seen a movie in a long time that is both as enjoyable and literally stunning as this film.  Frame by frame; Mr. Allen paints a portrait of today's Paris bathed in rain, sunsets and street lights.  I have been to Paris and never saw the city with the beauty that Mr. Allen filmed it, but he makes me want to take the next Air France flight from Miami.

Owen Wilson has always been one of my favorite actors.  Somehow, he channels Woody Allen without losing Owen Wilson.  It is a brilliant performance that I think is Oscar worthy.

I'm bothering to write a review to save people like me from tossing out any pennies on this stupid flick as well as removing any expectations you might have of a fun 2 hrs.

I like most of Woody Allen's films ... except for the too-far-out-for-me ones. Midnight in Paris definitely falls into that category. Owen has never done it for me, and the only time travel stuff I've fallen for is Kate & Leopold, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married, and The Lake House. You could fall into these movies, trip back in time with the cast and drop caringly into another century, forgetting ... for a while ... from whence you came.

If you want to suspend belief and watch Owen Wilson tiptoe thru time, acting his dumbstruck, dopey self, you'll love this flick. Personally, I'd have walked out of the theater in 20 minutes or less, but since it was online, I hung around waiting in vain for it to become likable. Never happened.

Hated it. My two-stars is only because if Woody did it, something brilliant this way must have come, even if I couldn't see it.

4841702,5,B005MYEQ4U,"From the opening images of Paris the viewer knows that he is in for a classic Woody Allen experience. He has always worked at his best when he makes the setting of his tales a living breathing character, just as important in many ways as his lead actors. While he flirted with this in Annie Hall, it became all out love in Manhattan. New York City, misty, dusky, flowing with lights and life became Woody's greatest love, dwarfing his affections for his two female leads and in the end informing his character far more fully than either of them. He does it again in Paris, falling in love with the incomparable cultural and architectural history of the great city through his protagonist, played with great effect by Owen Wilson. Shedding his aw-shucks mannerisms for a more controlled, introspective performance he does a wonderful job portraying a man seeking his creative center amid a failing romance and what appears to be a series of delusional encounters with Paris' rich cast of creative luminaries. Ultimately he finds a new love, and thanks to the guidance of the friends he has made in his surreal experiences, begins to explore his boundaries as an artist. He finally realizes that the limits he had struggled with were entirely self imposed and that if he simply allows himself to have a little faith in his own abilities all things may be possible.",1324771200,2,1362,4.77542372881356

It seems they are much more appreciated in Europe than the US but perhaps most Americans don't get it. He has a distinct humor with a cinematic brilliance that perhaps may be unsurpassed in the history of film making. His characters often remind the viewer of Allen himself...indeed if you closed your eyes when watching Gil Pender you could in fact imagine it as Woody Allen in some of his earlier films.

Much like Annie Hall, Manhattan, Broadway Danny Rose and others Midnight in Paris excels at scenery and nostalgic moments that make the viewer believe they indeed walked onto the screen and joined the cast. His characters seem to just walk out and incorporate you into their storey. Another brilliant score and background. It incorporates extremely well the visits from present to past and back again.

4841710,5,B005MYEQ4U,"When one lives in and loves a city with an ancient history, such as Paris or Rome, it becomes very easy to sense the existence of an imperceptible permeability between past and present. It is as if one only has to wait for the light to change a certain way, or for a bell to strike a certain hour, and the magic will happen--for those who are receptive to magic, that is, and are willing to believe in the Magic of Place.

This is the premise of Woody Allen's latest whimsical flight into the imaginative world of Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a self-acknowledged Hollywood screenwriting hack, who dreams of writing a novel, the protagonist of which owns a nostalgia shop. ""What is a nostalgia shop?"" asks one of Allen's characters. Anyone who has to ask such a question is assuredly immune to magic, and will probably not enjoy this film. Since I am a romantic and firmly believe in the Magic of Place, I enjoyed it immensely.

Woody Allen clearly loves Paris. His opening scenes, in fact, represent a paean to The City of Light, as for almost four minutes the camera, with an evocative jazz accompaniment, moves from point to point along the Seine, the Luxembourg Gardens, Montmartre, the Champs lyses, the Tuileries, the Left Bank, among other locations. We are treated to views of great boulevards, narrow streets, steep stairs, roofs with chimney pots, as the camera's eye glances at brasseries, cafes, fashion houses, fountains, the pyramid of the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Opera, and the Tour Eiffel. Paris in the sunshine; Paris in the rain. And all that is before the opening credits, in which we see that Allen, as usual, has assembled an ensemble cast. And for a special treat, the actual film begins among the lily ponds at Monet's Giverny.

Although I enjoyed all the performances, I particularly liked Adrian Brodie as Salvator Dali (He seemed so perfectly at home in Dali's surrealist skin), and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein (She brings a convincing panache to any part she plays). Marion Cotillard is charming as Pender's love-interest from the past, and her costumes--in fact, all the costumes--are splendid. Michael Sheen, looking a bit like Tony Blair with a beard, plays Paul, a pontificating academic, who cannot resist showing off his knowledge--never mind that he is mistaken--to their Rodin museum guide--played in an engaging cameo, by the glamourous Mme Sarkosy.

""Midnight in Paris"" deals with themes similar to those in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" in which the lines between past and present, between illusion and reality, become delightfully blurred. Magic, in fact, comes along in the form of a 1920 Peugeot, which stops and opens its door in invitation. If you accept, it will take you along for an enchanting ride!",1324684800,8,2740,4.873390557939914
4841711,3,B005MYEQ4U,"I wouldn't consider myself a Woody Allen fan, but I enjoyed this movie.  There were times that the acting seemed forced (in fact, I think the American actors could have learned some lessons from the Parisian/French actors on authenticity).  But overall, I had fun with the film.  There were points where it seemed forced.  I like Owen Wilson, but he just didn't seem engaged in his role, or perhaps the right fit.  He's definitely intelligent, like the role needed, but his delivery wasn't believable. ""Oh, you want me to do this right now? Okay.""  Perhaps a little too dry.  He just seemed along for the ride and even when he had his moments of clarity, it wasn't as if it was a big connect for him but... well, he was reading his lines.  No real emotional transparency, and that's what I enjoy about actors.

I was definitely entertained by the movie and have recommended it to friends.",1324598400,26,888,4.6050955414012735

4841713,3,B005MYEQ4U,"MIDNIGHT IN PARIS  sounds good on paper and looks in ads.  The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film.  Once the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own cuteness.

VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris with Inez' parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a business trip.  Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure.  As Inez sees the touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the magic of the city.  At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Thrse Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dal (Adrien Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Buuel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) - in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s.  Gil is captivated by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (Franois Rostain) at Maxim's.  Gil by day grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we are left with the moral 'Don't wish to live in another time than your own.'

Sounds like a run through of famous names?  It is.  Wilson is inept at romantic comedy, and Woody Allen's script is fairly boring for Allen's works.  BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough! Grady Harp, December 11",1324598400,5,2531,4.777522935779817

Owen Wilson gives a decent performance and although leans on the side of neurosis, he doesn't go too far as Allen has often portrayed.

4841718,5,B005MYEQ4U,"It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris ""fell"" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming ""movable feast,"" the new movie ""Midnight in Paris "".

I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long times and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame, following the Darius Khondji's camera on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fell in love with Paris and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians as to whom Paris gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle poque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...

Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).

Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel ""Bistro Fada"". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.

As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fiance), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.

The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.",1324512000,4,4602,4.83502538071066
4841719,3,B005MYEQ4U,"While I share Woody Allen's take on conservative Republicans, pretentious intellectuals and vapid, materialistic twentysomethings, he's set up those straw figures so often that they reek of shtick. The first twenty minutes or so of this movie, where we establish Gil Pender as a ""real, authentic writer"" surrounded by by a bunch of phonies (including his fiancee) made me squirm in  my seat. As soon as Gil has the first of his many forays into the Paris of the early 20th century, that's when MIDNIGHT IN PARIS finally gets traction and becomes a lot of fun. Gil is clearly having the time of his life living in the past, and each time he goes back to ""the present,"" I found myself wondering why on earth FOR? Owen Wilson makes as acceptable a Woody Allen stand-in as John Cusack was in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY...every mannerism he makes in this film screams ""Woody!,"" but it's not a distraction. The movie resolves itself about as you would expect it to, making this a pleasant experience on the level of EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, if not to the calibre of HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.

In my opinion, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is the best movie Woody Allen's made since SWEET AND LOWDOWN over 10 years ago. Take that however you want.",1324425600,4,1221,4.622119815668203

4841722,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I'm simply here to add more praise to this wonderful film. I went in knowing little about this film, and ended up leaving the theater with a big smile on my face. Woody Allen writes and directs Midnight in Paris, with a stellar cast of Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdam, Michael Sheen, and Marion Cotillard.

Allen is able to make an enchanting tale that sets his Gil (Wilson) on a journey of self-discovery, by having him explore Paris at midnight. I don't want to give much away, but he is able to visit the Paris of his dream--the 1920's with some of the greatest intellectuals of the 20th century. He's on a journey of self-discovery, and on a journey to answer the ""why"" in his life. Why didn't he stay in Paris in his youth, when he had a chance? Why does he feel like there's something missing from his life? Little does he know that someone from the past will shed light on the answer that was always there.

This is not a film you should miss, nor should Allen's personal life detract you from watching it. I promise it's a great film, that will have you laughing and smiling. Pay no attention to reviewers who consider Allen's portrayal of the historical figures as ""cardboard cutouts."" Ultimately, this is Allen's film set during magical nights in Paris, so his aim for historical accuracy of how the character's of the past should have ABSOLUTELY acted was not on his mind. But even biopics don't get that right, and no one is ever happy. Oh well, I feel sorry for them.

And take my word for it, this film would will be nominated for plenty of Oscar's.

To say that France was smart in not joining the Allied Forces in invading Iraq in order to help take down the Saddam Hussein regime (because Clinton and the U.N. for years couldn't) is a typical ignorant Neanderthal  hubris obtuseness from left wing 'Dingoism.'  If anything the opening scene with the left wing idiom being (regurgitated by Owen) overwhelming the conversation at the Paris Restaurant sets the hypocritical stage for the rest of the movie, and the pervasive left French stupor. France like the ignorant European left wing today cannot protect itself from the invasion of illegal immigrants from Morocco and other Muslim countries like it couldn't protect itself from the Nazis in WWII and now we are to accept left wing revisionist dogma from Hollywood in justifying political historical revisionism without intellectual dialogue within the scope of this so called artistic ""liberal"" movie.

4841731,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I once wrote a short story set around a night in Paris. It was brief, whispful, and altogether gleefully fun to write, despite it (perhaps aptly) breezy, simple nature. Having never been a devout follower of Woody Allen, people I knew were still keen on telling me that his newest project in his fascinatingly schismed filmmaking career was something that would speak to me. Even after having watched the film, I still do not quite know what to make of it but, if the quality of ""Midnight in Paris"" is of any indication, I'll be flattered and take it as a compliment.

Paris stands tall alongside New York as, perhaps, the most beloved city in the world. Seemingly catering to a man who has seen the rest of the world overcomplicate itself with the fallacies of a wholesome life, Allen paints the city as, quite literally, an escape from the more perplexing realities. Our naive and excitable writer protagonist, played by who appears to be an equally thrilled Owen Wilson, ventures throughout Paris' many different delights throughout the ages, meeting his historical icons and other prominent figures of the many artistic mediums. It sounds bizarre and ambiguous, but take it at face-value; this film bends reality, but to say anything more would be to spoil an otherwise remarkably exhilarating twist, at least to those who appreciate cameo appearances. Do yourself a favor and walk into this movie with a bat's blindness.

One cannot help to echo the thrills that Owen Wilson's character feels during his midnight journeys, even if Allen's obvious love affair with the city is not one that we, as an audience, can replicate. Still, he does a good job of giving us a taste of said affection. ""Midnight in Paris"" is an earnest love letter to everything that thrives upon human passion: Writing, painting, dancing, singing - Art. Love. They slip in and out of one another's arms, these things. Allen does this with such clear and innocent giddiness that, initially, he teeters on one-dimensional themes and characters.

Truth be told, outside of Gil, what you see is what you get, but Allen cleverly uses his unusual concept to deliver timely messages about life and one's complacency within it. It's hardly the likes of Kubrik-esque depth, but it stays with you. It's so very hard to expound upon any one detail with a film like this, as to do so would be detrimental to the experience of someone viewing it for the first time. The tale requires the audience to share the spirit of discovery with Gil. Do this, and the appreciation of this gem of a city isn't even mandatory. It is a bonus, of course.",1324166400,2,2603,4.78

This film has all the sparkle, wit and charm of Woody's earlier films like Annie Hall, Manhattan , Stardust Memories , etc. It is the best film of 2011 in my opinion. I am shocked that someone would give this film 1 star.",1323907200,3,314,3.921875
4841735,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Writer/Director/Actor Woody Allen may have found the perfect actor to inhabit the roles that he used to fill himself in his comedies like Annie Hall and Manhattan. That actor is Owen Wilson, who he discovered - along with Wilson's co-star in this film, Rachel McAdams - in the film ""Wedding Crashers"" (of all places). When Wilson spouts some of Allen's dialogue about not understanding his place in the world, you can hear the rhythm of Allen's speech pattern. And, like Allen, Wilson may be the male lead but he's not the normal ""handsome star"".

This film could very well be considered Allen's French equivalent to ""Manhattan"" - his love letter to New York City. This time it is Paris and there are more exterior scenes than interior ones. In fact, for the first four minutes, Allen shows us typical street scenes in Paris with no actors or dialogue; just a 30s jazz instrumental with Sidney Bechet on clarinet (Allen's own instrument of choice.). The plot takes Wilson - in a fragile relationship with his fiance McAdams (who is a very demanding - and not very flexible - flirtatious debutante or the equivalent).- on a time travel journey (at midnight every night) to meet with the artists and thinkers of the literary and art world. There are Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Hemmingway, Picasso, Dali and more. It helps a bit if the viewer knows something about F. Scott Fitzgerald and his Zelda, as well as placing Stein in her Paris years with Alice B. Toklas - but it's not necessary.

I've drifted away from Allen films lately but this one surely brought me back and I'm looking forward already to his next film.

The images in the film are beautiful but not sharp. This is on purpose since - as you learn in the brief 5-minute Press Conference at Cannes, which is the only real bonus feature (besides the Trailer- cast bios are on the BD) on both the Standard and BluRay DVDs- Allen wanted the film to have subtle colors with brown being the dominant one. (Remember he filmed ""Manhattan"" in black and white!). Others at the Press Conference are Wilson, McAdams and Adrian Brody, who plays Dali in the film.) The score is filled with great 30s gypsy jazz and some Porter standards.

4841738,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's love affair with Paris.

A winner of a movie! Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)

My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.

Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.

Paris IS a most beautiful city. I've walked much of Paris in the rain and I agree with one premise of this movie: rain enhances the beauty of Paris. (One of my most invigorating days, ever, was sitting on the top level of an open-air tour bus, in the rain, umbrella open, soaring around Paris from one arrondissement to another.)

This is a movie I will want to watch at least once a year as I do with Enchanted April, Amelie, Up At The Villa, It's A Wonderful Life and a few other classics where immeasurable love and skill went into their creation.",1322956800,7,1544,4.724907063197026
4841739,4,B005MYEQ4U,"If you've ever dreamed of walking the streets of Paris, this film will enchant you.  It's a charming substitute.
Midnight in Paris takes you to modern Paris and then whisks you away to the Paris of the 1920's when American expatriot writers and artists lived there and mingled with the French creative class.  Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald are characters in this movie when the character, played by Owen Wilson, is transported to the Paris of the 1920's.

He realizes his modern me isn't living his heart's dream as a Hollywood playwright--he wants to write novels and stay in Paris and these characters convince him that he should listen to his heart. They fantasize about the past and the Belle Epoque in the way he fantasizes about the 1920's in Paris.  He realizes he needs to enjoy the present but live the way he wants to in the present. He should live the life of his imagining not convention.

Rachel McAdams is believable as the spoiled fiance and Wilson is perfect in his role as the dreamy, but engaging romantic.  It's a fun film, with gorgeous scenery, that makes you think about the life you want to lead.  I'd like to see it again, just for the scenery.  My 26-year-old son started watching it with me and stayed through the entire film.",1322870400,2,1276,4.665178571428571
4841740,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Midnight in Paris is beautifully filmed with a good heart and dose of Woody Allen whimsy (my favorite of his various aspects), so I really enjoyed it. However, I wasn't as over the moon for it as many apparently were, so it was a 4-star, rather than 5-star, film to me. The story centers on Gil (Owen Wilson) a successful screenwriter who dreams of writing novels instead. He and his fiance (Rachel McAdams) - who seem mismatched from the start - visit Paris, and on one of his night wanderings (to escape the many social engagements she wants to attend) he finds himself transported to 1920's Paris, the 'Golden Age' to him. He interacts with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvatore Dali, and Picasso.

On the plus side, Paris has never been more beautiful as in this film, even on the 'small screen' (I can only imagine how gorgeous this was in the theaters.) The characters all are well-cast, and as an Owen Wilson fan, I was happy to see him do so well in this role. All of the 20's characters are also deftly played, although my favorite scenes - the funniest - were actually the contemporary ones, with his fiance's stuffy in-laws and friends. Wilson's character got to show a bit of acerbic wit in those scenes, and hence they were more fun. The 20's scenes were all very earnest and a bit self-important, so I just didn't enjoy them as much.

So overall, fun, unique, beautiful, and with many funny moments. If you love Paris, and especially if you love the bohemian Paris of the 1920s (and all the artists that thrived then), you will LOVE this film. If you are a fan of Allen's whimsy, you probably will too. Otherwise, it may just be good or OK for you, but certainly still worth seeing.",1322784000,2,1727,4.532051282051282

I went into this movie fearing it would be the typical Woody Allen awkward romantic comedy that is painful for me to watch unfold. Instead, I found it captivating: visually, emotionally, and intellectually.  The plot works well on several different levels, and the interweaving of episodes from La Belle Epoque and Paris in the 1920's satisfied the romantic as well as the historian in me.

Geek Alert!  I liked this so much I actually contacted my long-retired college American Lit. professor and invited her to see it with my wife and I.  She enjoyed it so much we actually had to try and stifle our laughter because others around us were beginning to stare.

I would recommend seeing it on Blu-Ray and a large screen TV in order to fully appreciate the rich visuals in Paris.

If you only enjoy it half as much as I did, you will still be glad you saw it.",1322784000,3,1089,4.415
4841742,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This review may contain minor spoilers...

Woody Allen's 41st film opens with several minutes of exquisite shots of Paris set to Jazz music. Cinematographer Darius Khondji elegantly captures these beautiful sites and effectively sets the tone for the film in which Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a Hollywood screenwriter working on his first novel while in Paris with his fiance Inez. After running into old acquaintances Paul and Carol (Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda), Gil goes on a walk to get away from it all and finds himself transported to the 1920s France, an era that he adores. There, he meets literary and cultural giants such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, and Salvador Dal, among others. He also meets and becomes fascinated with Adriana (Marion Cotillard), Picasso's mistress, whose ideas about time are in synch with Gil's own.

From the first frame, Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's most charming films in years. I've never seen a Woody Allen film I didn't like and there are only a few I wouldn't bother watching again. The general consensus is that his recent films are weak, especially in comparison to his earlier work. I am of the opinion that he's never made a bad film and each new film he made would be held in higher regard if not for the (many) films that had come before it. Whatever your stance is on Allen's films, both past and present, I think you'll agree that this is one of his best films in years. All of the elements; the casting, the setting, the style, and the story come together perfectly to create a magical romantic-comedy/fantasy. Midnight in Paris has many references to classic literature and film that certain audiences may not catch, but this movie is just so likeable that knowledge of the subjects involved is not necessary to enjoy it. It may cause you to seek it out after the film has ended however, but since when is knowledge a bad thing? It's certainly an accessible film, make no mistake about it, but it's also for a certain audience. If you're the casual moviegoer, you'll find little to dislike about it. If you're part of the audience this is intended for, you'll find almost nothing to dislike about it.

The musical score is so brilliant that it couldn't possibly be original. While many parts of the score are recognizably made of classic jazz music and some Cole Porter songs, I figured the main theme was original; alas, there is no original score for the film. The use of music and the music used is brilliant, as well as essential to the effervescent tone of the film. I can't rave enough about Khondji's cinematography as it truly evokes the beauty of Paris and captures it in exactly the idealized way that Gil sees it. The whole film is beautifully shot, from the first frame to the last. The cinematography is a loving testament to the otherworldly beauty of Paris and the beautiful sites that the camera lovingly lingers on makes the film work almost as a visual tour of the city, but don't think for a minute that this is a bad thing. This is a fantasy film and Khondji makes Paris appear as the ultimate fantasy.

As usual, Allen has assembled a wonderful cast lead by Owen Wilson in the Woody Allen role. Wilson shares some of the same mannerisms and speech patterns we'd expect if Allen played the role, but brings a distinct giddiness that only Wilson can convey. Gil is a memorable, extremely likeable protagonist whose wide-eyed wonder reflected my own. Allen never misses a chance to take jabs at pedantic, pseudo-intellectuals and Michael Sheen plays one perfectly, providing some great back-and-forth banter with Gil. Every actor makes an impression with their characters, with Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy being especially funny and well utilized as Inez's judgmental, materialistic parents. The historical figures throughout the film are given wonderful characterizations, with Corey Stoll turning in a vivacious, poetic performance as Hemingway and Kathy Bates making Gertrude Stein exude warmth and intelligence. Adrien Brody has an inspired cameo as the great surrealist Salvador Dal and his scene was certainly a highlight (""I see...rhinoceros""). With the First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, making an appearance as well, Allen's strong group of actors are one of the driving forces behind the reason this movie works so well.

Midnight in Paris features some of Allen's best writing years. The characters are well-developed of course, but the story is more inspired than usual. The dialogue is clever and witty (one of my favorite examples being Gil suggesting the plot of The Exterminating Angel to director Luis Buuel). Allen even takes a moment to take some light-hearted jabs at Tea Party politics. The ""earrings scene"" meanwhile is the most well-executed comedic scene that Allen has filmed in some time. This is Allen's 41st theatrical film since 1972 and while he's admittedly had some hits and misses, he proves that at the age of 75 he's still capable of churning out a genuinely great film. After making a huge per-theatre average on only six screens, Sony slowly expanded Midnight in Paris and it has consistently remained in the top 10 movies at the box office since. This is a huge feat for a Woody Allen film. Audiences have responded because Allen has made a charming, lovely, whimsical fantasy film that shows Allen at his most accessible and most consistent. With 41 films under his belt it's hard to say where Midnight in Paris fares amongst those other releases, but based on sheer likeability and quality I can safely say it's my favorite film of 2011 thus far.

But for some reason the movie gets into that easy going flow where one just goes along with it.  Owen Wilson is a big part of this.  The combination of his laid-back depression with Woody's neurotic depression works very well.  Aside from that, it's similar to watching Nancy Myers' Something Gotta Give... Excellent Fluff.",1322524800,5,483,4.925925925925926
4841746,5,B005MYEQ4U,"The reason Owen Wilson is perfect as Allen's new leading man is that he is about as different a guy from Allen as it is possible to be. Allen's biggest missteps in his later years have involved either casting himself as the romantic lead or casting a needed younger man but then have that man impersonate him. He needed someone who would find it virtually impossible to play Woody Allen.  He found that lead with Owen Wilson. Another huge advantage to Wilson is that gives us a mainstream American and gets Allen out of his own experiences in New York of decades ago when it was daring for him to flout convention and pick non Jewish women, most notably in his movies this was Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.  In 2011, of course, that is a very dated riff and made him out of touch.

The movie itself is a bit derivative of Allen Rudolph's MODERNS of a few decades ago which had Keith Carradine and Wally Shawn interacting with all of these same Bohemian artists and writers of 1920s Paris.  But Allen gives it his own fresh twist with the time travel aspect.

Wilson being bogged down with the elitist girlfriend and her parents, all American Republicans and proud and vocal about that fact, are the only predictable element to the movie. These kinds of characters are always in his movies as anathema to the soul of the artist.

Michael Sheen is unrecognizable as the pedantic Paul, an American professorial acquaintance, and does his usual marvelous acting job. Kathy Bates is wholly believable as Gertrude Stein.  Hemingway is his usual bull in the china shop self. Zelda Fitzgerald is seriously crazy.

It is definitely a feel good movie and is remarkably upbeat for an Allen film.

4841749,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just that as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose ""Rhapsody in Blue"" in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1979-masterwork/dp/0792846109/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1979 masterwork</a>. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fiance Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.

Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/6304907729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>. Gil - as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.

When I saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art this past summer, I received an in-depth primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over.

Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B0034G4P80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>) and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.",1322092800,12,4039,5.84406779661017
4841750,4,B005MYEQ4U,"I hated the protaganist from the very beginning, but strangely enough I enjoyed the film itself immensely.
The lead male, with whom we are supposed to sympathise, was obviously told to do his very best Woody Allen impersonation, ...which he does, ...much to my irritation. We get the usual constant New York over-analytical voice-overed babble that made Allen and his many neuroses such a self-caricature in the end. The actor even dresses in ill-fitting oversize clothing, as did Allen. It's as though Allen really wanted to play the lead himself, but he was too old so he just hired an impersonator.

That aside, ....the film opens with a lingering homage to Paris, ...the ""tourist"" Paris, ...which is probably the one we all want to see anyway. For some inexplicable reason known only to Allen it's all shot through a deep orange gel. I can only suggest it was meant to symbolise ""warm memories""?
If indeed this is the case then those memories must have been viewed through one of those Tandoori Chicken spray-tans we see on women nowadays.

The story itself has been well documented here. It requires you to suspend disbelief and ignore holes in the plot large enough to run the Metro through, but it's one of those movies where you can thoroughly enjoy sitting back and just letting it all wash over you. The strongest performances are all from bit players, ....Kathy Bates is a standout as Gertrude Stein.
The bride-to-be's parents are truly obnoxious American snobs, ....sadly not all that hard to find in today's Paris, although the mother does get some of the best lines.
Wait for ""And cheap is cheap I say!"" Perfect!

The bride herself is just SO vapid, shallow and self-obsessed that you cannot believe even the Woody Allen impersonator could ever have fallen for her in the first place, much less made it right through engagement and onto the impending marriage situation.

It's not giving anything away when I say that you too will know in about the first 15 minutes that she will be found out as having it off with the ""know-it-all"".

What is interesting about this movie is that the ""real"" people are just character ""types"", ......one dimensional and very stereotyped, while the fantasy characters have much more depth and end up stealing the show, ...along with the romantic City of Paris, which is probably the real star.
A case of imagination being stronger than reality perhaps?

I must confess that I have a fascination with Paris, ( I live there for six or so months each year), and the characters we see in the periods revisited during the course of this movie, so the historical re-creations of both people and places held the most interest for me.

You'll all know where this movie is going, but the journey is a very pleasant and picturesque one if you are able to just go along with it all. It's a fantasy, and whether any of it is meant to be actuality or it all takes place in the lead's over-active imagination doesn't really matter.
(No, he doesn't seem to drink absinthe at any stage.....)

4841752,4,B005MYEQ4U,"A charming, sweet film, that explores the nature of nostalgia (its glow
and its darker shadows), and shows off Paris, both modern day, and in
the 1920s, almost as beautifully as Manhattan showed off New York.

Laced with wonderful cameo and supporting performances (Adrien Brody,
Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard, Corey Stoll, just to name a few) and
gifted by a quirky, lovably sad Owen Wilson as a sort of Eyeore of a
struggling writer in the lead.

Wilson is probably the best stand in yet for Allen in one of his films,
precisely because he's so different from Allen, and doesn't seem to be
doing an Allen impersonation. (Even Allen admitted that part of the
appeal in casting Wilson was casting someone so far from himself).

The 94 minutes of the film flew by, and never lost it's charm.

A number of professional critics noted that this was a new tone for
Allen, neither laugh out loud comedy, nor serious drama (or, as in his
greatest films a combination of the two), but is more of a light drama,
with a gentle comic whimsy. I actually think Allen started exploring
this interesting new tone with his last film 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark
Stranger' And it does seem to have reinvigorated him.

I did have a couple of problems with the film. First, Rachel McAdams as
Wilson's fianc, along with her family, were made too caraciturish, too
obviously 'bad' for a film this subtle. McAdams is a brilliant actress,
but here she seems pushed into being a symbol of all that's wrong with
shallow, materialistic Americans.

More problematically, after gently, subtly exploring it's themes for
the whole film, Allen suddenly starts laying them on very thick at the
end, putting them very literally into the dialogue, almost as if he
doesn't trust us to be smart enough to get the point of the whole
lovely film he just showed us.

But these are minor complaints, and while this may not be one of
Allen's great films, it is a very good one, and that makes it special
and worth seeking out.",1321747200,4,1983,4.6164772727272725
4841753,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Paris is an easy to city to love and Woody Allen's film does a good job of exploring some of the cultural history of the city in an entertaining comedy. Owen Wilson often reminded me of Woody Allen in the way he delivered his crazy lines and I must admit that I was surprised that Owen Wilson could carry an entire film, appearing in almost every scene. Also note worthy are Rachel McAdams who plays his rich girlfriend. McAdams is a pretty good comedy actress and she holds her own. Marion Cotillard plays the mysterious beauty, Adriana that he meets in his journeys back into time.

The film is clever as Gil goes back into time into the 1920's where he meets Scott and Zelda, Earnest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Salvador Dali, Matisse, TS Elliot, and Man Ray.  Kathy Bates is a great Gertrude Stein and Alison Pill is superb in a cameo as Zelda. At night Gil gets into an old car that takes him back in time where he falls in love with Paris' past but during the day he runs around Paris with Inez and her conservative parents John and Helen. Mimi Kennedy is perfect as the white upper class conservative American woman. Gil is going through writer's block as she struggles to begin and novel. He longs for the certainty and glamour of the American ex-pats in Paris. Woody Allen has given us a clever and entertaining film on a wonderful city and the inspiration it has brought to generations of creative people.

Woody Allen has built a memorable canvas around and about Paris, the most glamorous, romantic and dazzling city in this world.

And somehow, this retrospective journey brought me back to the now forgotten filmic treasure of Rene Clair: ""The beauties of night"" . Woody shows us the charm, the spell and the fuzzy images that our memory preserves as if they were present.

Nostalgia should be a verb. Not a word. Woody Allen makes this term spreads its wings and hovers the vain illusion that past time was better.

I have a personal hunch. This movie must be selected among the top ten movies of this year. Its originality and poetry demonstrate us once more you don't need to be shielded with a huge budget, armed to the teeth of great special effects to make an unforgettable film like this one, which makes us think about the importance of the present moment respect the pleasant glare of the memory.

Don't miss it. Marion Cotillard is lovable in her role.",1320796800,29,1132,4.725888324873097
4841759,5,B005MYEQ4U,"""All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all,"" says a character in ""Midnight in Paris""... ""However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears.""

Paris is her name. She has seduced writers for centuries, and in ""Midnight in Paris"" writer/director Woody Allen makes love to her with his camera, in the most poetic of ways.

Or perhaps he's referring to art, to achieving such intimacy with your craft and such artistic climax that you become immortal, like Hemingway, Matisse, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali, or Allen himself.

Gil Pender, the protagonist in Allen's new film, has never experienced that kind of artistic height. Played quite convincingly by Owen Wilson (in a surprising and refreshing role that Allen had to re-write for him), Gil is an aspiring novelist who is visiting Paris with his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. But while they prefer to shop and visit museums, Gil chooses to wonder about. ""No work of art can compare to a city,"" he says.

Pender is actually mesmerized by the City of Lights and fantasizes about what he believes was Paris' Golden Age, the 1920s with the Lost Generation of American writers walking its streets, writing in sidewalk cafs, and frequenting smoky bars and flamboyant parties. One evening at midnight, trying to find his way back to the hotel, something magical happens to Gil. Really! But no reviewer should give that magic away.

Getting lost in the city seems to be a symbol for how lost he really is, as a person and as a writer, and although he's somewhat insecure and anxious (he even carries a bottle of Valium with him), he's actually a likable guy and soon meets a few bohemian friends (played by Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, among others) who give him much-needed advice about life and the creative process.

From the beginning, ""Midnight in Paris"" grabs you with its witty and sophisticated dialogue about art, culture and literature, and in the second half the dialogue gets even better. For instance, my favorite line comes from one of the bohemian characters, who believes that: ""the job of the artist is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.""

Another piece of wisdom comes from one of the antagonists who criticizes Gil for being infatuated with the past: ""Nostalgia is denial...a flaw in the romantic imagination of people who find it difficult to cope with the present."" Think about that one while watching the film, for I believe, there lies the moral of this fabulous fable about the past and the present.

At age 75--with more than 40 films under his belt--Allen has created a film that literally glows. Its dazzling cinematography, inventive plot, and Parisian score, combined with the top-notch acting and set-design, makes for an almost-perfect film, one that's not only clever and thought-provoking, but also entertaining and accessible--even to mainstream audiences.",1320624000,403,3066,4.986301369863014

4841763,4,B005MYEQ4U,"This is a very good film, I enjoyed it very much. It presents a number of historical figures (Picasso, Salvador Dali, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald) in an amusing way and tries to give a feel for Paris in another era. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Also, Owen Wilson is a much better stand-in for Woody Allen than Kenneth Branagh, for example.

That said I personally didn't feel this film was as original as many of Woody's previous works: it seems to me only an average effort. If it received so much acclaim, it seems to me to partly reflect the fact that the usual Hollywood fare, particularly in summer, is ever so much meaningless garbage.

I guess the film just felt at times too ""easy"". Allen's unsympathetic characterisation of Gil's fianc and her wealthy friends and family in particular seems too full of easy cliches. Which doesn't mean I didn't laugh at the way they are presented, only that it seemed too ""easy"" to present them as cardboard cut-out people who are rich, arrogant, entitled and out-of-touch. Similarly, the historical characters were surely an ""easy"" source of material and perhaps some of their lines are actual historical quotes. Just to say that it seemed to me to be an ""easy"" film which was not nearly as original or subtle as many of Allen's previous efforts.

Which doesn't change the fact that it was a very good film, one I would recommend, and one which was head-and-shoulders above most of the other films I've seen in the past year.",1319587200,2,1473,4.67953667953668

4841765,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is the kind of work that I loved about Woody Allen:  a bit surreal (or reality bending), with a quirky humor and yet some psychological depth. All in all, a very good story.  It reminded me in particular of his earlier Alice, with her invisibility and yet keen realizations about the state of her life, even her soul.

The narrative starts with a young writer who is in Paris with his fiancee and her family.  He is a hollywood screenwriter, but longs to be a novelist and sees Paris as a wonderfully fertile place to realize his dreams, to nourish a self that he hopes is somewhere within him.  It is perhaps his last chance before embarking on a life that would trap him.  His companions stand is such stark contrast that you wonder what he could possibly see in them:  the fiancee lacks imagination and feels no desire to take the chance of embracing a new culture, her mother is a crass materialist who views Paris as a shopping mall, and the father is a Tea Party fat cat full of paranoia and a fatally narrow mind.  The only thing I would imagine he sees in the her is perfect sex.  The American friends they meet are hardly better, including a pedantic and shallow professor whom his fiancee ridiculously idolizes, reducing the guy to snide sarcasms.

So the stage is set for a life drama.  What then happens - the guy repeatedly travels back in time to meet his idols in the Paris of the 1920s, even accepting Hemingway's advice and passing a manuscript to Gertrude Stein for her opinion - evokes the magic of Paris better than any film I have seen in several decades.  It is like he is in a dream, but at the same time he meets the stunningly beautiful and slightly decadent Marion Cotillard as a mistress of Picasso, and his feelings for her get him to question everything he is about to do even more.  It works emotionally and was completely believable while I saw it.

In fact, the film also touched a chord in me:  I did go to Paris after college and tried to live a life similar to the one he imagines, complete with an obsession about the same writers and artists who appear in the past.  It was a time of magic, experimentation and dreams and it completely changed my life.  Allen plays with these themes to perfection in the film, even in the reactions of his awful companions, who simply can't see what he does, even in his enjoyment of the city in the rain.

Warmly recommended.  This is the first film of Allen's that I unequivocally enjoyed since my circle of friends rejected him after the Mia Farrow debacle.  It is a genuine masterpiece.",1319241600,7,2566,4.4423076923076925

And while it's fun to hang out with Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Stein (Kathy Bates does a great Gertrude Stein, and Carey Stoll is outstanding in his capture of the cliched Hemingway delivery) as well as the surrealists Dali, Ray and Brunuel, it does get a bit tiring once again hearing that standard Woody Allen ironic and intellectual New York humour coming from the mouth of a young artist from Marseilles. This also makes the second ""henpecked boyfriend finally figures out that his girlfriend is a bitch"" type of film I've seen in a row, the other being The Hangover. Oh well.

What a magical way to start my own vacation. The film did not disappoint. It starts out with a lovely wordless picture log of Paris to set the tone. Then what seems like a light fluff of a movie turned into a layered and intractate set of thoughts and ideas about life. Ideas including how prescious it is and how important the here and now is, as well as how important are the people we choose to spend our day to days with. Left with thoughts like was it real or was it imagined, there are lots of clues to lead a person both ways. I won't give them away. But be careful because Woody is anything but on the nose and the few hints he gives either way could easly be missed. I watched the movie a second time on the plane without the sound and enjoyed the visual experience with equal joy. (One of my tests of a great movie.)

4841769,4,B005MYEQ4U,"In addition to the sordid life that adds fuel to the fire of Hollywood celebrity news, Woody Allen's been making some degenerate stuff (e.g., Vicky Cristina Barcelona) aimed at the core of civilization, rather like The Exterminating Angel, which Allen references in this movie. So I haven't paid attention to him for a while. From recent photos from the opening of this movie Midnight in Paris, it appears he's suffering from that human condition that makes him now indistinguishable from the elderly Alec Guinness.

The argument Allen gives us in Midnight in Paris is that the sensation of infinity experienced in love is the only antidote to the fear of death.  And the purpose of art is to help people deal with the neuroses that attend the fear.  Of course, the other antidote is immortality through fame, and this is the route Allen has chosen for himself, as he tells us in this film.  Here is the typical Woody Allen focus on sexual betrayal, death, and the meaninglessness of life, but with just the right touch of nostalgia so that the film actually critiques modern times rather than fanning the flames.

As you probably know, the Woody-Allen-stand-in played by Owen Wilson is an aspiring writer who vacations in Paris and is picked up by a taxi-cab from the 1920s every midnight. Awe and hilarity ensue, and Wilson realizes he can't love his fiancee, who is a Malibu bimbo.  Humor-wise, the best part of the film (spoiler alert) is when Wilson gets into a cab with Eliot and tells him ""Prufrock's been like the theme of my life...""

Slightly less obviously, the film is Allen's nose-snubbing at the rest of the world. Wilson is a self-effacing writer who, nevertheless, won't let anyone critique his novel until he meets Hemingway and Gertrude Stein. The implicit message here is that, unlike the Tea Partiers and hoi polloi of the U.S., Allen is a Real Artist, whose work is fit to be judged only by his peers in the artists' pantheon.

Midnight in Paris is filled with references to giants of modern literature and art. Allen throws us some bones, but if you don't get the joke about Prufrock above due to not knowing either Woody Allen films or T.S. Eliot, you aren't going to enjoy this movie.

I saw this movie in the theater, so I have to go by memory here, but I believe the ""portrait of Adriana"" by ""Picasso"" looks very close to Picasso's painting The Bather but is not.

Like Tilda Swinton and Helen Mirren, the woman graces everything she does, 4) Adrien Brody doing an over-the-top Salvador Dali (wait, how can you be over-the-top of an original over-the top?), 5) genial time travel if you stand in the right place at the right time (hint for the time: check the title), 5) the gentle lesson that every golden age has its own imagined golden age.

4841782,5,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight in Paris"" is a delight. A reminder that Woody Allen is one of the best movie writers/directors out there no matter how creepy he is off camera. This is a comedy about a struggling American novelist (Owen Wilson) who becomes lost - figuratively and literally - in Paris' nighttime streets, the lights and spirits of deceased artists, musicians and writers lulling him in utopia. Then he gets lost - in time - when a 1920s taxi, every night at midnight, whisks him away to the days of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter and Ernest Hemingway, what Owen's Gil considers the greatest era for artisans in history.

Back in 2010, Gil is the fianc&eacute; of a wealthy woman (Rachel McAdams) who as with her Tea Party parents rejects anything not American and has no appreciation of art. Only status. She openly pines for a former professor, a know-it-all played wonderfully by Michael Sheen, who starts off every sentence with, ""If I'm not mistaken,"" when he is indeed. So, yes, Allen uses the crutch of the wicked girlfriend to allow his male hero the right to fall in love with the more pure Adriana (Marion Cotillard), the mistress of Picasso. Small error in a grand film.

This just isn't a new classic Allen comedy, it's a tweak at nostalgia fever by both Tea Party Americans who long for the founding days of America, and daydreaming liberals who think art was somehow more pure 100 years ago. Both are wrong. ""Midnight"" has more wit than any film I've seen all year. The best joke has Hemingway, Picasso, Fitzgerald, Dali (Adrian Brody!) and dozens of others treated as biopic shadows. Picasso belligerent, Dali talking nonsense and Hemingway uttering every word like a bull fighter with a rifle slung over his shoulder. It is all a wicked satire ala homage. The great artists (and he never says it, but Founding Fathers) we uphold as gods are as false as the notion that life was happier in 178whatever. Fact: You were likely to die of small pox than live out a life of glorious freedom, no matter what cracked teapot Michelle Bachman says.

The best scene has Gil talking to Dali and his fellow surrealists, fretting over his time travel predicament, confused by the mess of his life, and they nod their heads, knowingly and approvingly. Flustered, Gill spits out, they're surrealists, they have no concept of normal. Fantastic screenplay. Wilson has never been more likable, and ""Inception"" star Cotillard knocks every other female onscreen out of the park. ***** Four Stars. See [ ... ] for more...",1314403200,7,2525,4.8

4841786,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I've never really been a Woody Allen fan. While I've appreciated his accomplishments, both as a filmmaker and as a musician, his films never knocked my socks off; at least, not until now. ""Midnight in Paris"" could very well have been titled ""Love Letter to Paris,"" because that is exactly what it is. Main character Gil Pender's (Owen Wilson as the Woody Allen surrogate) love and enthusiasm for the City of Light is contagious, especially if Paris already has a special place in your heart.

To say the film is gorgeous is an inadequate description, at best.  There were moments where I was actually moved to tears. Paris is a visually magical place, and cinematographer Darius Khondji captures that magic throughout the movie, as does Allen's script and Wilson's portrayal of a man hopelessly smitten with one of the most beautiful places on earth.

This is a hard film to review without giving away a few spoilers, so to be brief here's what you really need to know:

  If you love Paris, you'll love this movie.
  If you like Woody Allen, you'll love this movie.
  If you can't stand Woody Allen, but you love Paris, you will not only love this movie, but you'll start to like Woody a little bit, too.",1314057600,2,1205,4.6415094339622645

4841789,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is a wonderful movie, well worth your time and your money, and as one who's seen it three times (more, if you're reading this after the DVD comes out, for sure!), I can tell you it's even more charming upon the re-viewing.

As with all Woody Allen movies, music is very important, and is always appropriate to the mood, and this movie is no exception.  Playing over the wonderful opening montage of Paris scenes is the great Sidney Bechet, with his own composition, ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"".  Stephane Wrembel plays a Django Reinhardt-like gypsy guitar throughout much of the movie, but the closing credits went by too fast for me to read whose version of ""Parlez Moi D'Amour"" it was, also played at very poignant and, again, appropriate times.

Others have mentioned the ""awful"" parents, and his equally awful fiancee.  Gil has a narrow escape from these people, the kind who know the price of everything and the value of nothing.  There's a sad, but very telling, scene where a piece of jewelry Gil gave Inez is derided by her and her mother because the gems were moonstones -- ""MOONSTONES!"", as in ""Can you BELIEVE IT??"".  When Gil says he likes moonstones, his future mother-in-law says one of her most revealing catchphrases: ""Cheap is cheap, I always say!"", and she always does say it.

If you are a romantic, love Paris (even if you've never been there), yearn for someone with whom to share your dreams and passions, this movie can even help you understand that your Golden Age can be exactly where you find yourself, in the here-and-now.",1313625600,,1547,4.682656826568266

Woody Allen."" Or it might mean: ""Nobody really spouts so much blather so interminably as Woody Allen in his logorrhea mode."" Either interpretation would be sustainable. But in this film, written of course by Allen, actor Owen Wilson is assigned the task of talking just like Woody... and he pulls it off expertly.

I had misgivings at the start, when Wilson's Woody-talk is heard behind the titles. I had an awful premonition that this would be a 'talky' psycho-morass like several of Allen's films of the 1990s. But it isn't that at all. It's a whimsical romp through Paris now and before, a spoof of Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and all the sainted luminaries of art and literature in the Fabulous '20s. Hemingway is deliciously portentous, Fitzgerald is as haplessly vague as his own Gatsby, and Stein is grandmotherly.

I also am not fond of Owen Wilson, but then again it was the more the silly roles he has played that I didn't like.. I loved this film. It is beautiful, it is so obvious that Allen loves this city, he caressed it as he filmed it. You felt every plane and every curve. The cinematography was incredible.  I wanted more and I will probably never see Paris but I can be a voyeur and watch this film again and again, to get my Paris fix.

4841796,2,B005MYEQ4U,I had the feeling I'd seen it before. The plot was similar to other Woody Allen movies. The actor played Woody Allen more than he played the movie character Gil. He sounded just like Woody Allen. He walked like Woody Allen. And another actor played the same character played by Alan Alda in other Woody Allen movies. Dialogue sounded the same as in other WA movies too. But the original Woody Allen was more like-able than his actor-imitator in this film. Nothing new here except the 1920s Paris scenery and costumes.,1311465600,8,517,4.6923076923076925
4841797,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Now playing in art theaters, this film, written and directed by Woody Allen, is an absolutely delightful comedic fantasy that kept me engaged throughout and smiling the whole time.  Actually, it was so good that I didn't want it to end.  This is saying a lot for me because I usually don't like romantic comedies.  But ""Midnight in Paris"" is so intellectually conceived, well paced and intelligent that I forgot all my preconceived notions about this genre.

The film opens in modern Paris with a young couple on a pre-marriage honeymoon. Owen Wilson is cast as the future groom.  He makes a good living writing film scripts but his real ambition is to write a novel. This ambition is ridiculed by his fianc as well her parents.  One night, not being able to stand the ""know-it-all"" stuffiness of a friend of the bride, he takes a walk at midnight.  Suddenly an old fashioned car from the 1920's pulls up and the partying people inside invite him in.  He then time-travels back in time to the 1920's and meets such greats as Cole Porter, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Salvador Dali and various other personages of that time.  He even gets a chance to ask Gertrude Stein, played by Kathy Bates, to give him her honest opinion of his novel.  This is a wonderland for him as well as the audience and the fast-paced script kept me completely involved as the plot developed.

Our hero also meets Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and falls in love.  However, she finds the 1920's boring and glorifies the turn of the century.  Later on they are transported to that time and place only to meet the famous people who find an earlier period of time the most fascinating.  All this is very interesting and the casting is terrific, even including the First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, cast a museum tour guide.

All this is done with all the pomp and costumes of the various eras, making for great comedy, nostalgia and authenticity.  How it all turns out is to be expected with our hero beginning a new romance in the present. It's not usual that I heap such extraordinary praise on a movie.  But this one was special and I heartily recommend it for everyone.",1311465600,,2172,4.614583333333333

4841799,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I adored this film.  From the first impressionistic moments showing a multitude of  Parisian city scenes I was utterly sucked into the heart of this film where I remained for its entire duration, completely entranced.  The Woody Allen I have always loved is back, and for me, this is without question his finest film and his finest writing!  I attended university in the 1970's and was thoroughly steeped in the prose of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and others of their era.  I read them, read about them, and ended up with a familiarity that left me feeling as if  I had lived among them in that era myself.  Having also spent a year in France with much time in Paris, I have such nostalgia for that time in my life and what I experienced there as part of my own expat community of the time.  Hence my initial interest in this film, which did not disappoint on any level.  I have always liked Owen Wilson, but I do believe this is his finest performance to date.  He was perfect in every way, and best of all, he played the role of Gil exquisitely without being Woody Allen in disguise, quite a feat, actually.  Owen was himself, his performance was somewhat muted yet poignant, and this was his best role ever and one of which he should be proud.  The casting of Corey Stoll as Hemingway and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein in particular were standouts for me as the embodiments of how my youthful imagination envisioned those larger than life characters.  The fantasy aspect of the story in which Gil travels back through time to meet these characters is never an issue in believability, it simply ""is"".  Rather, the joy of the story is in the words of the various characters as they relate to each other, and Woody's script is beautifully and memorably written.  I enjoyed every moment of the film and did not want it to be over. It was such a joy to watch.",1311465600,,1853,4.48955223880597
4841800,5,B005MYEQ4U,"It has been nearly 25 years since I checked out a new Woody Allen film. I was a huge fan of his work in the late 60's and the 1970's but for the most part Woody kinda lost me after that. Several weeks ago a friend called me raving about ""Midnight In Paris"". He didn't tell me a whole lot about it but assured me that I would love it. I took the day off today and one of the things on my ""to do"" list was to check out this flick. I went to an 11:15 A.M. screening this morning and although there only about 10 people in the theater I wanted to stand up and cheer when they rolled the credits. For me ""Midnight In Paris"" was a sheer delight.  In fact, this is a film that I would definitely like to see again.

""Midnight In Paris"" stars Owen Wilson as aspiring novelist Gil Pender and Rachel McAdams as his lovely fiancee Inez.  The couple are visiting ""The CIty of Light"" with Inez's parents.  Gil and Inez seem very much in love as the film opens but cracks quickly begin to develop in the relationship.  Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter who has simply become bored with his work and dreams of living and working in Paris the way the great artists and writers of the 1920's did.  Inez has other ideas.  She longs for the glamorous life in Malibu with all of the amenities.  Inez is definitely going to be high maintenance.  Gil feels at one with this place and wants to explore the streets of the city and savor the essence of Paris.  Inez prefers to go off with friends and take in the art galleries and museums.  They are slowly drifting apart.  Gil's life would forever change one evening when at the stroke of midnight a limo pulls up alongside him and the occupants invite him to join them.  Suddenly and remarkably Gil finds himself  smack dab in the middle of the 1920's Paris he has always read and dreamed of.  Furthermore he has the opportunity to meet and greet several of the legendary figures who were living in Paris at that time.  That list would include writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T.S. Eliot, the legendary songwriter Cole Porter along with jazz great Josephine Baker and a group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Paul Gauguin.  Gil desperately wants to show Inez what he has been experiencing but only he is allowed to enter into this bizarre netherworld.  During his travels Gil also meets a ravishing young lady named Adriana (Marion Cotillard) with whom he has much in common.  Here finally is a place where he feels fulfilled.  Meanwhile, as you might expect all of these improbable events do not bode well for the future of Gil and Inez's relationship.

I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoyed ""Midnight In Paris"".  The views of Paris both during the day and at night were nothing short of stunning.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission.  And in the finest tradition of Woody Allen films the music was also tremendous. There are a whole host of great selections from that era.  The acting was superb and the writing top drawer.  Woody Allen has outdone himself this time.  ""Midnight In Paris"" is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by teens and seniors and everyone in between.  Very highly recommended!",1310688000,3,3210,4.4879310344827585
4841801,3,B005MYEQ4U,"There is no doubting Woody Allen's talent but recently his films have not measured up to his talents.  Midnight in Paris is his most recent effort and clearly a vast improvement over his previous ones.  The movie is well written --  at least the flashback scenes -- and the cinematography outstanding.  The film itself reflects Woody Allen's love affair with the decades between the end of WW I and WW II.  He showcases some of the litierary and artistic luminaries of the period although he presumes his audience is not only familiar with the works of these characters but of their peresonalities and history as well.  Consequently this film is probably wasted on much of todays audience who probably would not know who Zelda is much less her sad history or Gertrude Stein as well.  However, the Hemingway character is not only well done and well acted but gives some humor and authenticity to the flashbacks.  The lead character in the film does a good job but seems an unlikely candidate as an author of any talent or motivation.  But as usual in films coming out of Hollywood there has to be a villain and that villain must be a businessman and a Republican -- preferably some sort of extremist totally out of touch with civilization and taste. Woody just couldn't try something original like making the villain an extreme liberal so he throws in references to the Tea Party and Republicans as the Neanderthals they are in the eyes of the East Coast and Hollywood liberals  - real villains in his eyes.

The movie itself gets off to a great start with an unlikely premise of time travel but that creates problems with the ending.  It seems obvious that whole point of the movie was to bring some of these characters to life in a contemporary environment but that complicated the ending which seemed very forced.  Overall this was a great improvement over recent Allen efforts.  It is enjoyable but not worthy of seeing a second time.",1310342400,3,1937,4.6923076923076925

It makes me yearn to go to Paris again. Were I a young girl again this is the city I would love to live in. This film is certainly on my list to purchase and watch again and again.",1310256000,,512,4.029411764705882
4841803,3,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just that as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose ""Rhapsody in Blue"" in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1979-masterwork/dp/0792846109/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1979 masterwork</a>. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fiance Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.

Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/6304907729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>. Gil - as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.

Thankfully, I just saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, so I received a primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over.

Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali.

Owen Wilson is absolutely the perfect person to portray a young man torn between the inner

Wilson seems to constantly be just on the edge of finding his own reality and the side trips

Carla Bruni is one of the most attractive and sensitive museum tour guides one could possibly

4841805,5,B005MYEQ4U,"It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris ""fell"" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming ""movable feast,"" the new movie ""Midnight in Paris "".

I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long times and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for.  I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was.  From the first frame, following the  Darius Khondji's camera  on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fell in love with Paris  and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians as to whom Paris  gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle poque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...

Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours.  Oscar nominee, the  master cinematographer  of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with  Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and  the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).

Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel ""Bistro Fada"". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the  film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.

As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel,  a protagonist, a  much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fiance), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans.  The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.

The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled  happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.",1309824000,4,4618,4.83502538071066

***This review contains spoilers***

The Film 5/5

Woody Allen has directed more than 40 movies and Midnight in Paris is one of his best. It's a gentle comedy with a strong fantasy element. Like most of Allen's movies, it relies on good writing and clever dialogue.

The fantasy element changes the entire feel of the movie, and although it's revealed early in the story, I don't want to ruin it for anyone. However, this would be a very short review if I didn't mention it at all. So please be warned that the remainder of the review contains spoilers. If you don't want to know, it's time to stop reading.

The story is built around Gil Pender (Wilson), who arrives in Paris with his fiance, Inez (McAdams). He's a writer hoping to find inspiration and she wants to see some of the local sights. The two explore the city with friends Paul (Sheen) and Carol. Paul claims to be an authority on everything and Gil is annoyed by him, but Inez used to have a crush on Paul and enjoys his company.

One evening, Gil decides that he will take a walk alone to get away from Paul. He's a little drunk and manages to get lost, and eventually finds himself sitting on some steps at midnight. It's here that the entire movie changes. A vintage car stops and the people inside urge Gil to get in. They take him to a party and he discovers that Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald are among the guests. He's surprised at their names, and even more baffled when he's introduced to Ernest Hemingway.

Gil has traveled back into the 1920s.

What would you say to Fitzgerald and Hemingway if you were an aspiring writer? Gil is both astonished and thrilled to be in their presence and mentions that he's also a writer. The trip to the past isn't permanent and he wakes up in the present the next morning. Was it just a dream, or was it real? Allen never explains how Gil returns from the past.

He tries to reenact the event, taking Inez with him, but she leaves before midnight. When the clock strikes, the car appears again and he's back in the past. He's introduced to other famous artists, singers and writers, and Gertrude Stein (Bates) critiques his manuscript. Gil seems at home in the 1920s and happier than when he is with Inez in the present. The people seem to understand him better and he fits right in.

The story is filled with interesting encounters. The characters spend a lot of time talking, and Allen's imagination keeps things more than interesting. I found it quite gripping. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Hemingway and was reminded of Dan Simmons' fictional book about him, The Crook Factory. Every encounter with people from 1920s Paris was both charming and intriguing. I found myself imagining how they must have lived, and what it would be like to exist in such a creative environment.

The audience in my theater laughed often and everyone left with a smile on their face. It was a magical experience seeing people such as Dali (Brody) and Picasso before they were famous. The setting was perfect, showing the contrast between modern Paris and the city as it was almost a century ago.

Wilson was as good as I have ever seen him in the role that Allen presumably would have played in his youth. I like Wilson's quirky delivery and his character wasn't too far removed from the one he played in The Darjeeling Limited. Gil enjoys defying expectations and isn't understood by his friends and potential in-laws.

All of the acting impressed me and Sheen was just about perfect as the insufferable Paul. The story was imaginative and different, and not at all what I expected. I left the theater grinning and charmed by the whole story. Allen's last Oscar came in 1987 when he won for Best Screenplay (Hannah and Her Sisters). I wouldn't be surprised if Midnight in Paris received a couple of nominations, and he might just win a fourth Oscar.

If you enjoy Woody Allen at all, Midnight in Paris is well worth a trip to the theater. Its charm will draw you in and the dialogue will make you laugh.",1309564800,,4246,4.5904887714663145
4841807,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" is a comedic fantasy about a Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender, (Owen Wilson) who yearns to be a novelist based in Paris.  However, he is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a beautiful but shallow woman who wants to live the good life in Malibu.  Adding to the tension, Inez's parents are less than thrilled with their daughter's choice of fianc; they are convinced that Gil is beneath her.  When the young couple piggybacks along on a business trip to Paris along with Inez's parents, the City of Lights once again casts its magic spell.

Much to Gil's shock, when the clock strikes midnight, he is invited into a vintage car and is spirited away to the 1920s, where he is stunned and delighted to meet such luminaries as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates at her most wonderful), Picasso, Dali, and Adriana, played by the luminescent Marion Cotillard.  Gil even has an opportunity to discuss life and literature with a smug Ernest Hemingway.

Allen has created a cinematic love letter to a place that he obviously adores.  He wisely never explains the fantasy elements, but encourages us to sit back and enjoy the humor and romance.  Since this is a souffl that could have easily fallen flat, Allen wisely maintains a light touch throughout.  Allen's theme, that we can never be happy unless we are true to ourselves, is delivered unobtrusively.  The cast, led by an ingenuous and earnest Owen Wilson, with cameo appearances by actors who are obviously having a ball, is uniformly excellent.  All this plus the sights, sounds, and atmosphere of Paris.  What more could anyone want from a summer movie?",1309046400,,1664,4.882562277580071
4841808,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I just returned home from the local cineplex, very pleased at having caught this enjoyable and creative film.  Lots of highbrow humor here, along the lines you'd expect of Woody Allen, along with something of a morality tale that really get's you thinking. Ever since he made ""Match Point"", a few years back, I've found myself impressed with Allen's capacity for high drama and comedy. My only complaint in viewing. ""Midnight in Paris,"" was that the identities of some of the historical characters was elusive.  I did conduct some research on arriving home, however, and it all fell together rather nicely.",1308960000,,606,4.99009900990099
4841809,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I abandoned my personal boycott of Woody Allen films to see ""Midnight in Paris"" mainly due to the dearth of quality films that come out to our theaters (the industry seems to think our sotted suburban brains crave scenes of women vomiting in the street and pooping in sinks a la ""Bridesmaids."") The theater labeled this film ""cine-arts"" which scared me a little, thinking my husband would probably hate it. But since he'd been monopolizing the remote control to watch endless Military channel shows on the Nazis, he owed me Paris. Especially since I'd just finished reading ""The Paris Wife"" and rereading  ""A Moveable Feast"" and was longing for midnight scenes of lovers walking along the the Seine.

The cinematography alone would have been enough for me, but this was so much more. What could be better than visiting the world of American expatriates in 1920s Paris, meeting Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Stein, listening to Cole Porter tunes and seeing the beautiful sights of this lovely city. The wonderfully imaginative story contrasts that era with our own, as Owen Wilson escapes from his soon-to-be bride (an unusually bitchy Rachel McAdams) into the era he wishes he were in, only to realize that his problem was not the present time, but his choice of a woman. Sure there were flaws, but all-in-all a magical escape that left me wanting to see it again and again.",1308700800,10,1370,4.875536480686695
4841810,5,B005MYEQ4U,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. If you are into the arts and literature, have visited Paris with an understanding of either, or are just a hopeless romantic, you will love this movie. It touches on many other genres, but one has to be careful in a review to not disclose too much in this almost magical experience. Frankly, I have not always cared for Woody Allen produced movies, but that was sometimes because WA acted in many of them, and I always had difficulty identifying with him in the roles in which he played. This time around, he found Owen Wilson to take his place, and OW is perfectly cast. In fact, I found all of the casting to be remarkably thoughtful. Poor casting is one of the great weaknesses in most modern films, but WA hit it just right for this movie with all roles. As each layer of the plot unfolds, I was amazed at my comfort at the casting. This movie is a gem, and will become a cult classic. This will be one of those rare movies I need to watch again over the years.",1308614400,3,1018,4.198979591836735
4841811,4,B005MYEQ4U,"As much as my wife and I have been enjoying a lot of the big summer movies these past weeks (films like ""X-Men: First Class"", ""Super 8"", etc.), we started craving a movie that perhaps wasn't so adventure and special effects oriented. So we recently headed out of the quiet suburbs to an art-house theater in the city to catch Woody Allen's latest film, ""Midnight in Paris"".

Funny, whimsical, and moving, ""Midnight in Paris"" turned out to be the great adult treat I thought it would be. My wife even liked it, and she's not exactly the biggest Woody Allen fan in the world, usually just seeing his movies because I like them. But we both got caught up in this tale of an American writer in Paris (Owen Wilson) being transported each night at the stroke of midnight to the Paris of the 1920's, where he pretty much meets up with every major literary and artistic figure- Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Salvatore Dali, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, to name a few- who was hanging around the City of Lights during that period.

Do deep, introspective scenes result from Owen's character, Gil Prender, meeting all these artistic geniuses? Nah, Woody mainly keeps things light and funny, an approach that mostly works just fine. While the movie could have benefitted from a little more complexity with its plot and characters, it was always a lot of fun to watch Gil make excuses each night to break away from his increasingly shrill fiancee and her stuffy parents to return to that stylish earlier time, to eat, drink and cavort with his idols.

There's no big, original lesson Woody is trying to impart with his story, just a few small truths that we all sometimes forget. But even those were secondary to the simple joys of spending time in both present-day and 1920's Paris, both quite beautiful, and both more than ample reason to see this engaging, charming movie.",1308528000,2,1863,4.708588957055214
4841812,5,B005MYEQ4U,". . . with Midnight in Paris. It probably helps that I just got back from Paris a few months ago, and that I'm a writer, so I related with every thought of Owen Wilson's character.

I'm not normally a fan of Woody Allen's work, but this one defies his other films and becomes something that is wonderful and amazing simply for being. The ambiance of this film is reminiscent of Stranger Than Fiction, which, if you haven't seen that, is an absolute must. It has same mythical/magical yet realistic quality I adore. In literature, that type of story is often called Magical Realism, and for good reason. These films take ordinary people and add enough magic that they become extraordinary, even if just in their own lives.

It may already be too late, since the Amazon review spoils much of the mystery, but if you can, AVOID ANY SPOILERS before watching. I knew what was coming and was excited for it, but I imagine had I not known and gone in with a clean slate, the experience may have been even more magical.

Can't recommend this movie highly enough. I'm just waiting impatiently for it to be released on DVD so I can obsessively watch it whenever I need a bit of magic in my own life.",1308355200,3,1189,4.444954128440367
4841813,3,B005MYEQ4U,"I miss Woody Allen. I really do. I think somebody doppelganged him after Zelig and there's been an impostor making the same film over and over and over and, well, now they are all blond with California accents as though the Beach Boys embody the same neuroses that New Yawkahs carry with pride. Having seen this today, I said to the missus that I felt like I was watching a two hour episode of Seinfeld. It's a movie that isn't about anything other than showing you how good Paris looks when you can recite the script as the story unfolds. What this has going for it is that it is infinitely better than Veni, Vidi, Vicki Barcelona. Anyone who makes a movie with Penelope Cruz that sucks deserves to be locked in an elevator with Tom Cruise for all of eternity.

Paris upstages the script here in every frame. The only time it gets it wrong is when Carla Bruni pops in as cemetery tour guide. She's a cardboard cut out that affords Allen bragging rights that he got the ex-mistress of Clapton and now Mrs Sarkozy in a cameo. She's neither funny nor sexy, just there, like the shrubbery. And then there is the way Paris is filmed, it's pleasant and certainly reminiscent of better films shot in Paris, most notably Before Sunset. My guess is that it was shot in Spring.

I tend to think that Owen Wilson is one of the very worst actors in the world. However, he almost takes the role of ersatz-Nebbish someplace other. There are great stretches in the film when he's his own man, and at those points, he rises above what has always seemed to be his stoned and pathetic persona. When the script reduces him to the aforementioned bleached out Upper East side spoiled neurotic, the film misses a great opportunity to break free from the Allen-esque cliches that showcase Woody on auto-pilot. All his basic tricks are still there: superficial references to psycho-analyses and existentialism delivered in opposition to a Tony Roberts stand in; relationships that are flat out wrong; cultural disconnects that vaguely echo the great dysfunctions of Annie Hall's family; prurient interests in wild sexual encounters. Wilson seems ready to take these tried and true formulas out for a ride, but inevitably you hear Woody behind the character Wilson plays, and frankly, that's a shame, most especially for Allen.

Vicki was a film for the daughters of especially spoiled Americans who haven't a clue how good they have it. This film returns the focus to the parents. Not sure it's so easy to relate to the angst of those who can't decide whether to buy, buy, buy, in Paris, crap they have no place for, for the exclusive reason that it's expensive and it's Paris and you can't get this crap back home, even in Crap Depot, i.e. LA. Yes, that's the existentialist point of conspicuous consumption, but those kinda empty calories have been trotted out so many times, they've lost their bite.

Before Sunset accomplished a number of things Allen's film might have taken up and expanded upon, not the least of which is the nature of relationships in a world whose certainties have become fleeting. A long time ago, that was Woody's court. The tricks of time that the film plays with are imaginative, but serve only as tricks, and an excuse for a bit of Marie Antoinette slapstick. Before Sunset ran in real time, and made its points with a whallop you wish Allen could muster again.

One of the other cliches attendant upon an Allen film is that all of the senior citizens in the audience applaud as the credits roll. It's polite applause. The kind of applause you make when you haven't been either challenged or offended. The latter is honourable, the former tragic. Allen is capable of a better and funnier film than this. Maybe he'll make it.",1307836800,9,3731,4.672754946727549
4841814,5,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight in Paris"" is the best Woody Allen film I've seen in years! I absolutely loved it! It's part-fantasy, part-romance, part-comedy, and part-time travel. And it brought back fond memories of American literature, film studies, and art history classes I had in college.

The star of Allen's film is Owen Wilson, who plays Gil--a Hollywood screenwriter who is engaged to Inez (an awful materialistic blond beauty, played by Rachel McAdams). They are in Paris with her parents (who are as awful and materialistic as Inez). Gil wants to walk in the rain and soak up the romantic atmosphere of the city; Inez wants to shop and hang out in museums, and go dancing and wine-tasting with a couple, with the male an annoying, pedantic fellow. Gil really wants to finish his nostalgic novel and live in Paris, not go back to California and his movie scripts.

Somehow, Gil winds up in the Paris of the 1920s--his ""golden age""--with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Salvador Dal, Luis Buuel, Man Ray, Josephine Baker, and others from the period. He even spends some time in the 1890s with Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

Wilson is wonderful as our romantic hero, as is Marion Cotillard, who plays Adriana (who has been a mistress of Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani). Also outstanding in other supporting roles are Kathy Bates (as Stein), Michael Sheen (as the pedantic character), Corey Stoll (as Hemingway), and Adrien Brody (as Dal). And La Seydoux is charming as  Gabrielle (a love interest).

This is a film that I will be sure to purchase when it comes out as a DVD. It is warm, funny, romantic, clever, and entertaining.",1307836800,62,1693,4.926315789473684
4841815,4,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody Allen started off his filmmaking career with comedies, then swung to Ingmar Bergman influenced ""serious"" movies, but lately Allen has found a nice balance between the two, at least in ""Midnight in Paris.""

Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is an American hack screenwriter in Paris with his fiancee Inez (Rachael McAdams). Gil is worried that he's missed the literary boat by not trying for art and writing a novel while living in a garret and suffering for your art. Gil is in love with the nostalgic history of Paris and the 1920's ""lost generation"" of Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and visits to Gertrude Stein's (Kathy Bates) salon and feels he was born in the wrong era. On a walk through the streets of Paris at midnight he's picked up by a car full of revelers and they whisk him off to a party, and finds himself being serenaded by Cole Porter (Yves Heck), and talking literature with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), and they whisk Gil off to meet Hemingway and soon Gil is showing his novel to Gertrude Stein!

This is every writers and/or artists fantasy, and Allen pulls it off masterfully. From capturing the sights and feel of Paris, to giving life to the period pieces of the fantasy. All the actors turn in fine nuanced performances that let you buy into Allen's fantasy. Nobody but Woody Allen can write the kind of dialog Allen can, in another writers hands the dialog would seem fumbling and tangential.

All the characterizations are spot on, the actors even look like the people they're supposed to be, Kathy Bates as Stein almost steals the movie, and Adrien Brody's Dali is a humorous cameo. The only characterization that is a little off is of Hemingway. Allen's Hemingway seems like it's everything you've ever read about Hemingway in a condensed version. One minute Hemingway is pontificating about Zelda's envy of Scott Fitzgerald's writing (as correct as the assessment is) and the next second asking who wants to box.

""Midnight in Paris"" is a nice fantasy, and an interesting alternative to all the super hero movies of this summer.",1307836800,7,2111,4.839335180055402
4841816,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I would give it a 5 star. I have seen all of Woody's  films, and with Every one, I step back to ask myself, what was the original silly premise, and how did he follow-through to transform it into a movie?  Also, I ask, ""who else could have taken the same idea and made it into a movie that will last and last ?"" Woody has that facility. I am not a director nor a screenwriter. I  do believe I have a nose for a good movie from the tens of thousands of watching movie trailers, then deciding to shell out money  on the merit of the trailer. With trailers being available on-line, movie going has been easier for me and has saved my tons of  money. Enough of me!! Scanning Woody's films, I see in ""...Paris,""  flavors of ""Play It Again, Sam"", ""Radio Days"", ""Annie Hall"".  He has experience in creating the right old-time atmosphere  from ""Radio Days"", dialogue with hallucinate figures in ""Play It Again, Sam"" and the cartoon witch in ""Annie Hall"",childlike magical moments from ""Alice"", and ""Everything....about Sex"" all which I felt and analyzed from watching the trailer just onlce..  Since Woody has gone overseas after ""Hollywood Ending,""  to create Scoop, Match Point, Christina Barcelona, there has been a re-birth of untapped creativity, taken from his travel bags. This is also a new cast, without Scarlett this time. Who could have taken the same idea to form this movie... Clint? Quentin? Steven? psh psh.  Yep, this is my critique garnered from  just the trailer.
Jump forward to today June 12, 2011. I just saw the movie and was quite confused at my emotions, simple and basic as they already are... the opening scenes were automatically transposed from ""Manhattan"", except now instead of Manhattan as THE EPICENTER OF THE UNIVERSE, the viewer is to thrust into the charming arms of Paris and along with the opening lines by Owen Wilson who could not hide Mr. Allen's persona leaching thru. I was pretty angry, thinking I was not supposed to see thru this ruse... BUT.... let me tell you, then some fairy dust must have been sprinkled on me and I noticed a magical trance, yes-magical, childlike, in fact, slowly enveloped me. I was trance fixed into the screen and also wanted to stay there for the rest of the film. I did not want the film to end.  Midnight in Paris was more than just charming and reminiscent of his other films.  I also wanted to live in the 1920's(In Hollywood, actually. I agreed with Paul, that it is a denial of the present, but who cares?,--the feeling has always been with me. I liked it then, and Midnight in Paris, had convinced I was not wasting my time.

4841819,5,B005MYEQ4U,"""Midnight in Paris"" is one of Woody Allen's enchanting forays into cinematic fantasy. While it isn't quite up to the fantasies Allen made in the 1980s (""Zelig,"" ""The Purple Rose of Cairo""), it merits a solid four-and-a-half stars, and I'm happy to kick in the extra half-star to give it the highest rating.

""Midnight in Paris"" is the story of Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter dissatisfied with his career, visiting Paris with his snippy fiancee (Rachel McAdams) and her dreadful parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy). One night, wandering alone through the Rive Gauche, he sees an ancient Peugeot limousine; the passengers stop and invite him in. This is Gil's entry into the Paris of his dreams--the Paris of the Twenties, in which Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pill, Tom Hiddleston) and others cavort in a magical city of abundant promise and possibility. There is even more promise and possibility in the person of Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beautiful fashion designer and artists' groupie with a passion for the Belle Epoque of Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec.

Allen doesn't try to make ""Midnight in Paris"" anything more than an airy little souffle of a movie. But the film is far more optimistic than any that Allen has made recently, and he sustains its magical mood brilliantly. (He grabs us with the opening few minutes, a wordless mini-travelogue of Paris accompanied by a lovely, slow Dixieland blues.) Owen Wilson brings a joyous, puppy-dog eagerness to the lead role, and the rest of the cast is equally fine; Michael Sheen has some wonderful moments as the sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual Woody has been skewering at least since ""Annie Hall."" ""Midnight in Paris"" has a pointed yet painless moral--that it's up to us to create our own Golden Age, right here and now--and envelops its viewers in a lingering, enchanted glow.",1307404800,156,1947,5.119496855345912

I'm a big fan of Allen, and enjoy all his work, but this movie is a return to his sublime magic with films like Manhattan, Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. And in fact, may be a bit better, or perhaps just very different but equally captivating. Owen Wilson turns in a great performance, as does the entire cast. I found myself swooning during the film, actually falling in love with it as it unfolded on the screen. Lovely surprise. I'm buying this as soon as it is released. It's a keeper.",1307232000,154,534,4.35

Woody Allen is a cyclical filmmaker - he follows a good film with a string of unforgettable and just plain bad films that he doesn't seem to have his heart in. Given he consistently churns out one or two films a year, this leaves a lot of celluloid for his fans to slog through to get to the gems. I used to be a devoted fan and would happily sit through the more 'trying' films. But a few years ago, the balance shifted. He used to make two or three enjoyable films followed by a mediocre film. Now, he might make a good movie and follow this with three, four, five bad films. When I started consistently sitting through a fifth dud, I gave up. A filmmaker who once was one of my favorites is now relegated to catch-it-on-DVD status.

Allen's newest film, ""Midnight in Paris"", starring Owen Wilson (Danger, Will Robinson. DANGER!), Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Adrian Brody and Michael Sheen, got a lot of good pre-release buzz, so I decided to give it a try and headed to the theater.

Allen has made some interesting casting choices, using a wide range of actors to play the leading man in his films, the role he would normally play, but has moved away from in recent years. Kenneth Branagh, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johannson, Larry David, Josh Brolin, to name a few. It is a strange mix and has produced uneven results. Some of these actors have played pale copies of Allen's persona; others have ventured to create something new. So, I wasn't thrilled to learn Owen Wilson was his latest choice. I have enjoyed very few of Wilson's films and it doesn't appear to be a good match. Allen's dialogue, his writing style, is very distinctive and I couldn't imagine Wilson making it work.

""Midnight"" opens with a montage of beauty shots of Paris. This sequence is enough to make anyone who has been to the City of Light, anyone who has read about the City of Light, or anyone who has any desire to see the City of Light swoon. These portraits will make your yearning increase ten fold. Allen and his cinematographer Darius Khonji (""Seven"", ""Panic Room"") capture every famous location, every famous street and neighborhood, painting each in sepia tones, giving us a romantic snapshot of each, as though they are taking us on an exclusive, inclusive walking tour.

After this introduction, we meet Gil (Wilson) and his fiance, Inez (McAdams) who have joined her parents on a mostly-business trip to Paris. Gil is like a child in a candy shop and can't stop talking about all of the reasons he loves the city. He even tells his future wife he wants to drop his career as a screenwriter, move from Pasadena to Paris, and work on his unfinished novel. A walk in the rain wouldn't be bad either. Inez can't wait to return home and seems annoyed by Gil's dreams. Then, they run into Paul (Michael Sheen) and his wife, Carol (Nina Aranda). The old friends invite the second couple to join them for some sightseeing. Inez is fascinated by know-it-all Paul and is grateful to tag along. But Gil is bored and breaks away, he simply wants to walk the streets and soak up the culture, the ambiance. He quickly gets lost and at the stroke of midnight, an old limo drives up and the man in the back beckons Gil to join them. Gil climbs in and meets F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston, Loki in ""Thor"") and his wife, Zelda (Allison Pill). They attend a party and Gil soon meets Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll, TV's ""Law & Order: LA""), Salvador Dali (Adrian Brody), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and Picasso's newest muse, Adrianna (Marion Cotillard). Naturally, Gil loves this world and the daylight hours in the present become more trying.

""Midnight in Paris"" is far from the greatness of ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" or ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", but it has some moments. Allen's love of Paris and the era Gil escapes to is both obvious and infectious. When Gil talks about his love of the city, his desire to walk in the rain, to tour museums, to sit at sidewalk cafes, this is Allen talking, using this character to tell us his feelings. And Wilson does a good job of portraying Gil's love. When he first enters this other world with the Fitzgeralds, he does so in a way we can believe. He doesn't rub his eyes in an exaggerated way; he remains silent taking everything in. When he finally realizes this is no joke, he just goes with it. Would Hemingway agree to look at his book? No, but Hemingway wants Getrude Stein to read it. She agrees. Gil can hardly believe his luck. The next night, he is prepared, holding a copy of his unfinished manuscript when the clock strikes twelve.

With each new introduction, he becomes more and more comfortable and wanders into a restaurant where he meets Man Ray, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali. And as he becomes more comfortable with these people, Gil begins to utter little asides to each of the famous people, giving them hints to a future work they will create. These are funny moments, especially when the famous writer or painter doesn't get it, doesn't believe what Gil is saying.

As Gil spends more time in this world, he gets to know Adrianna better and their relationship blossoms in a sweet way, taking some nice turns along the way.

Wilson actually does a pretty good job in this film. It is a quiet, understated performance for him and a nice change of pace. Not only does Wilson seem to be handling the material well, Allen's writing seems looser, allowing the actor to get a handle on the director's writing. There are fewer references to psychotherapy, neuroses and other Allen mainstays than in previous films. Gil is simply fascinated by the city and the people he meets there.

Allen never has trouble casting his films because actors clamor to work with him. He has a huge reputation and has helped many actors achieve some of their best critical notices; Leonardo DiCaprio, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Hugh Jackman, Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, Josh Brolin and many more have all appeared in his films. And he frequently has the good fortune to cast up and coming actors, usually after they have made a critically acclaimed film or just before they hit it big. These 'unknowns' have included Scarlet Johannson, Freida Pinto, Radha Mitchell, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and others. In ""Paris"", Corey Stoll plays Ernest Hemingway and he is the best of the actors playing the plethora of writers, painters and artists. Currently on ""Law & Order: Los Angeles"", Stoll manages to capture the bravado and machismo of the famous writer in a way that also seems completely natural and right for the character. Every time Hemingway speaks, you can imagine him filing the statement away, to be used later in a potential short story or novel. It is a funny, spot-on performance.

The problem with so many actors clamoring to appear in Allen's films is that many of these actors take on small roles, sometimes very small roles, and because they are top billed, their performance seems disappointing. In ""Paris"", Adrian Brody plays Salvador Dali, the famous Spanish surrealist. He has one scene with Wilson's Gil, which is funny, but it doesn't add or contribute to the story enough to make it worth the time. Ultimately, having Brody around for only five minutes is more disappointing than the laughter his brief role creates.

Tom Hiddleston, Allison Pill and Kathy Bates are all good and they have a little more time to make their characters come alive.

During the present day moments, Gil spends a lot of time with Inez, as he feels he should, but he is just biding his time until he hears the clock chime midnight and he can return to Paris in the 20s. It is easy to see why  - Inez is a pretty unlikable person and you have to wonder what Gil saw in her in the first place. Rachel McAdams does what she can with the role, but she is never sympathetic or even slightly likable. Allen seems to feel she needs to be completely unsympathetic to make Gil's burgeoning romance with Adriana acceptable. Why this is, I don't know. In previous films, we always felt a little something for the wife or girlfriend, felt some sympathy for them when their husbands or boyfriends started cheating on them. But Inez seems to have nothing in common with Gil, she doesn't support or share his dreams, she seems only interested in the material life, the good life, she seems to be from a whole different place altogether. Because she is such a polar opposite, she sticks out like a sore thumb and the role seems forced and unnatural.

Allen does work in a few funny jabs at current politics because Inez's parents seem to be staunchly Conservative. These lines are funny, but will also make the film seem less universal as time passes.

Michael Sheen is very funny as Paul, the know-it-all who everyone seems enthralled with. Everyone except Gil. He clearly can't stand Inez's old friend, yet Paul and Inez both seem oblivious to this. At one point, Paul gets into an argument with a tour guide as they stroll through a sculpture garden. Later, because Gil know has some first hand knowledge, he feels confident to debate Paul, leading to some laughs. Naturally, Inez shushes her fiance because she only wants to listen to Paul. But even he seems to disappear after the first half of the film, as Gil becomes more and more captivated by the romance of Paris in the 20s.

This is the biggest fault with the film. Allen seems to have great fun introducing all of these characters and elements, but he has difficulty keeping them all going and simply abandons many to concentrate on certain aspects of the story. Maybe the director who could keep many character storylines going throughout the course of the film is gone. Maybe the director of ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is gone. I hope not.

Later, Inez and Gil have a fight. This scene has all of the elements of a great Allen moment- we watch the couple walk back and forth into the room as they argue, it seems like they might really get to the heart of the matter between them. But Inez makes a confession, which comes out of left field. It just seems arbitrary and forced. Worse, this scene seems out of place because the dialogue abruptly changes back to 'typical Allen'. Inez and Gil begin to talk as though they have been in therapy for years. The looseness, the freshness of the rest of the movie is gone.

""Midnight in Paris"" is an enjoyable little trifle. The good parts are good, the bad parts are mostly just mildly annoying.",1307232000,3,10508,4.661090124123044
4841822,5,B005MYEQ4U,"Woody's heroes/heroines are the romantics of all epics, eternally uncertain of themselves & their place in the world (so he loves F. Scott & Zelda); but here he also professes admiration for the clear-sighted who offer advice to the lost romantics among us (so he loves Hemingway & Stein as well); and there's even a passing nod of recognition to the unhinged (Dali, Bunuel, Man Ray).

His villains are those who use intellect or artistic talent as a weapon of seduction or social dominance. And American pragmatism/materialism that seems designed to alienate us from our finer qualities.

With Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen continues his critique of American identity/aspirations. Like Henry James, he finds it easiest to study Americans when they are in foreign locales. But all of the old themes are here as well (underconfident romantic up against overconfident poser; romantic/artistic disappointment tempered by humor; bittersweet Chaplinesque ending).

The only thing that makes the 70's Woody Allen films (Annie Hall, Manhattan) better than the current series (Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris) is the absence of Woody Allen. This was not as noticable with Vicky Cristina Barcelona because the leads were female, but here its almost impossible not to imagine a younger Woody doing all of his signature things with this role. Owen Wilson does a fine job here, but Woody Allen himself playing this character and talking to Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Stein, Picasso, Dali etc....would have been out of this world.",1307145600,11,1539,5.299180327868853

Owen Wilson plays Gil, who is soon to be married. He wants to stay in Paris, but his fiance, Inez, doesn't which causes Gil to wander the streets at midnight, where he is taken to the 1920's, where he always wanted to live. It is a simple plot, with a simple, and can I say cute, message. Owen Wilson is on the top of his game here, and he contributes to the funny moments of the movie. The rest of the cast was fine, playing the roles to predictable. The characters that Gil are introduced to us are each unique, and interesting. Especially Brody's cameo, which was done very well.

The best part apart this movie is the cinematography. Every shot is beautiful and Woody picks some perfect locations, and there are a lot of famous landmarks. A lot of the shots contain a lit up Eiffel Tower.",1307059200,5,952,4.4655172413793105

4841825,5,B005MYEQ4U,"I have to admit that I have always thought of 1920's Paris as a golden time, an ideal time to be in the City of Light. So it was only natural for me to want to see Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris.  Without a doubt, Mr. Allen loves Paris. It is clear from the opening minutes when we are transported to all of the familiar spots in Paris.  Owen Wilson gives a splendid performance as Gil, a screenwriter who desperately wants to write novels.  After Gil's first time travel episode, meeting the likes of F.Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Cole Porter I found myself looking forward to his nightly travels into the past.  Rather than writing clich&eacute;-ridden dialogue for his famous characters, the conversations are very natural.  Perhaps the most memorable and humorous performance goes to Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali.

Midnight in Paris is a romantic comedy, with Gil on the verge of marrying the wrong woman (nicely played by Rachel McAdams).  Gil wants to show her why Paris is such a special place and she wants to go shopping.  Midnight in Paris is a charming, funny and thought provoking film that certainly was a hit with the audience when I saw it.
