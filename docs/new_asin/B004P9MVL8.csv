8529564,1,B004P9MVL8,I live in Texas...I did not think I would have issues with playing this DVD. I have always ordered movies from Amazon and I've never had this happen. My players say wrong region.. playback prohibited and error. The seller is from London and they should be aware of what can and can't be played in the US. My son was devastated when he couldn't watch his video that he had to wait 3-4wks for. Really disappointed: (,1353888000,5,414,4.3896103896103895
