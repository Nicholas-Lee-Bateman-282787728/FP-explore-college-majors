There are no region 1 DVDs available for this for this last season.  I feel this was deceptive, and no returns are allowed because of this.",1479168000,,271,4.4

8723622,3,B0114I093E,"I've been a fan of the Strike Back series ever since someone told me about it a few years ago. The cast receive training from former UKSF personnel so that their weapons handling, drills, and fight sequences are far more realistic than the tedious Rambo-style spray-n-pray nonsense in which good guy rounds magically find their target and bad guy rounds go stray. The two lead actors in particular move like real soldiers, so the training paid off. The action sequences are very believable - with allowance made for the necessary explosions etc. so vital to today's big-budget experience.

The problem with this final series is that the ""plot"" has become an afterthought. It's now so clichd and so implausible that it's obvious the script writer was only focusing on stringing together as many action sequences as possible with as little in between as he could get away with. The result is consequently incongruous: believable action sequences embedded in a totally trite and unbelievable plot. Add in lack of care with dialog (really, who in anyone's military uses ""yards"" these days?) and you get the feeling that the writer and director just didn't care.

That's a shame. With a little more focus on the plot and dialog this could have been an utterly compelling series and a great swan-song. As it is, unless all you want is fights, shootouts and explosions, you'll come away from watching this series with a feeling of anticlimax and disappointment. It could have been a really great TV experience but instead it's just so-so.",1439856000,3,1531,4.930232558139535
