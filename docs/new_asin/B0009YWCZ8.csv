8168348,1,B0009YWCZ8,This is the worsed of a quality DVD I've ever received. Just too many distortions and misses within a picture on the screen. Also the DVD was loose in the cartridge and has various of scratch marks. As I've already mentioned it is just a very bad item and it is to me rather amazing how this kind of an item is sent out to a customer - on top of it all it is not a cheap item either. Please let me know where to send this DVD for an exchange or a CREDIT? Please send to me the INFO as quickly as possible as I'm leaving for Europe soon. Thanks.,1145750400,3,544,3.8660714285714284
