If any thing the seller should of marked the condition of the product as ""Good"" instead of ""Like New"".",1399680000,,283,3.896551724137931
8000713,5,B0000DD79J,"FMP is the story of Kaname and the Mercenary Sousuke. Kaname is a high school student that holds the key to black technology. An advanced form of technology used in military applications. Sousuke is a mercenary assigned to guard her. The problem is that he has been fighting battles since he was a young boy, and he has no common sense or social skills. He is always causing trouble for her, but he's the best candidate to keep her safe. The story follows their adventures from their high school all the way to the battlefield and back again.

FMP has everything you could want out of an anime series. Action, comedy, drama, sci-fi, and a bit of romance. The animation, story, and soundtrack are all awesome. It's a 5 star series in every possible aspect. It also stars the best voice actors in the business. I have always loved this series and I hope you do too.",1353888000,,863,4.496815286624204
8000714,4,B0000DD79J,"This 5th volume of a great series begins with part 2 and 3 of ""The Wind Blows at Home"", a storyline from Volume 4. Sousuke and a team have been sent to recover a nuclear warhead in Afghanistan, which happens to be the country where Sousuke grew up as a fighter against the Russians. It was there Gauron slaughtered most of his comrades, including his friend and mentor, Zaied. Since he knows the country, it should be a snap for Sousuke to slip past the enemy forces. There's a problem though. Zaied isn't dead and he's on Gauron's side.
""Deep Sea Party"", the third episode on this disk takes us back to the relationship/situational comedy of Sousuke and Kaname. Sousuke invites Kaname to a southern island, just the two of them. There's only one week left in the summer vacation and Kaname has wanted to spend time with him. Of course, being Full Metal Panic, Kaname will probably end up jumping out of planes and docking with underwater secret submarines and Sousuke will be hit in the head with a newspaper.
The thing that is great about this series is that it has two storylines, almost two genres to work with. You have the mecha fights as Sousuke fights Gauron and goes on all kind of secret missions with lots of smooth animation and action sequences. Then you have the school setting where the cast is dealing with just everyday problems with relationships and loads of physical comedy. Some episodes can be bloody and dark and then next episode you're laughing. The Japanese voice acting is superb with just the right actors/tresses playing the parts. The only thing that bugs me is the invincible Gauron. I mean, he must have died in this series about 3-4 times already, plus one more if you count a flashback sequence. I guess they needed a strong villain, but kill him already!
There's really no extras worth talking about here. Just the usual bare minimums. Sketches, privacy warnings, openings/closings.",1087948800,,1917,4.7253731343283585
8000715,5,B0000DD79J,"Being a new connoisseur of anime this is my first review and quaintly enough this is the first review for this installation of FMP. After watching the first 4 Discs of this Anime series I must say that I am not only impressed with the visual presentation but am glad to see that this series makes full use of its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track. A combination of comedy, mecha, and romance makes for a quite unique series that takes full advantage of all the devices that come with each territory. The series does have some similarities with other Anime's in that it has your typical filler episodes but the writers have done a good job at making sure that these episodes don't stumble too hard. The characters are extremely well developed though I would like to see more background information on them . . . perhaps later episodes will expound on this more. Also the artwork from the DVD posters gives you a satisfactory amount of information on various aspects of the series and even on the individual episodes. All in all, this series has great potential and it leaves you trying to guess as to how the ending will fold out. I definitely recommend this series to anybody who is a serious collector.",1071273600,,1199,4.5813953488372094
