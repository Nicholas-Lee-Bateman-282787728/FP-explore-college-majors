8097437,4,B000CCD25G,This is one of the mixtape i personally liked. Because I'm part of the experience itself. Not bragging or something but I hang out with them when they played here in Manila. This dvd really completed my experience.,1170979200,,214,4.657894736842105
8097438,4,B000CCD25G,"Japan, Hong Kong (but not shown), the Philippines, New Zealand, and Australia: And1: Asia Pacific Tour is as much a basketball exhibition as a cultural one, from the corporate madness that is Japan to the third-world ghettos of the Philippines.

Three things stand clear from this video: 1) Helicopter must have, pound for pound, inch for inch, the best vertical of ANY And1 player EVER, and this video showcases that; 2) Aaron ""AO"" Owens is the most accurate passer I've ever seen not in the NBA; 3) a lot of these players can be complete, hypocritical beyotches.

Case in point: It's ok to push and shove your opponent, rip their shirt off, and throw a ball in their face...but when they do it to you, you hold your face as though you're hurt? C'mon, even Jordan acknowledged that risk, saying, after Allen Iverson famously crossed him over, that you burn and you get burned--it's the risk of it all. Alimoe, despite his amazing skills that come back in this video, is a big practitioner of ""I can do it to you, but you can't do it to me."" Hot Sauce, not present, is next on the list.

Highlights:

- Spyda and Helicopter each get a local in Australia and play ""you try to dunk on me, then I'll try to dunk on you."" Ridiculous when you think that the opponents know what type of shot is coming.

- A Filipino kid PUNKS Alimoe majorly, and pulls a move that has to be in the Top 10 of the exhibition moves (meaning moves taken from the Rucker tournament or in-game somewhere, are on a whole 'nother level).

- 50's winning dunk in the Spyda (New Skool) v. 50 (Old Skool) Dunk Off.

- End Credits. This features some nasty trick shots, and starts off with a hilarious interview by AO of a guy who says he's Chinese (looks like it), but was born in Mauritius, which is off the coast of Africa, but grew up in India. AO spins him silly like he does players on the court, asking constantly if he's Indian or African.

It's worth your money, finally. The players are new, with new moves, traveling to places where their opponents haven't been overexposed to the AND1 phenomenon. The crowds are genuine and excited, as is the intensity of most of the games.

My new favorite, since the Vol. 1-4 DVD.",1145404800,,2194,4.437810945273632
8097439,4,B000CCD25G,"It was ok, its not all that y'all made it seem. Maybe because I've been watching And1 since jump. Since Vol. 1 Dropped until now I've probably gave And 1 well over $2000+ and gone keep giving them money, from the DVD's to the actual games I attended and the players I've met. But this DVD was ok. Depending on when it was filmed, look like Alimoe is back on the tour, but where was Escalade? Shane ""The Dribbling Machine""? Flash? I didn't see any of them dudes. And they nice. But Alimoe did his thing as usual. And one of them places, don't remember which, Alimoe and AO was gettin DRAGGED by that lil' boy, they couldn't take the ball from him for real.

But I'll continue to support And1. Even though they hated on Seems like by the EBC (Entertainers Basketball Classic), Ruckers Park, that you dont' hear about too much no more, aside from there 2 DVD's they put out, most of the And1 Players are from the EBC, Skip, Main, Shane, High Octane, Escalade, Alimoe, Prime, All Day...

Oh and I cant wait until this season starts up, Air Up There, that 6'2"" Mofo from TX, 360 between the legs, thats all I gotta say, [...] peep the video stream, that's all I'm gone say.

Oh yeah, get the DVD, spite its missing players, its still pretty good. Don't get it if you looking for new moves, 'cause it can get repetative (I think thats how you spell it) but DO get it if you wanna see Alimoe back on the the Tour and Main Event back in his prime, well just about, he still go it and this tape shows it. also Spyda vs. 50 in a Dunk Contest!",1142035200,,1532,4.204081632653061
8097440,5,B000CCD25G,"This is a must own for any & all hoops fans.  Forget which league/player/etc. you follow - if you like tough dunks, hard D & moves that you only dream of pulling off - get this DVD NOW.

Off court stuff is classic AND1 - watching the players interact with the locals in Japan, Philippines, New Zealand & Australia is really funny.  Pharmacist is a nut & you can tell he's out doing the thing & enjoying himself while living a life he never thought he'd have access to.  Real inspirational stuff here.

DVD extra's are c-r-a-z-y...Spyda/'Copter dunk off against the locals, Team AND1 practices, etc. all make the latest DVD from the kings of streetball into their greatest to date.  A great soundtrack helps to round out everything.  Don't sleep on the hidden easter eggs within the show either...

Volume 8 is more ""authentic"" streetball as it's true to AND1 Mix Tape form, but the Asia-Pacific DVD includes killer ball footage & off-court stuff.  I own all the DVD's, this is my favorite next to the DVD with Volume's 1-4 on it.

8097441,5,B000CCD25G,"This DVD is crazy, good highlights, girls, girls, crazy dunks. One of the things that i like about this DVD is the real feel that his has with all of the player reactions to different things that happened along the tour. There faces when they got to New Zealand were hilarious some may even say priceless. The arguments they had at practice showed that it's not all for show and its still street ball. The dunk off was worth the purchase alone. If not anything else you have to see the local's vs Spyda and Helicopter. Crazy!",1138924800,,525,4.422680412371134
