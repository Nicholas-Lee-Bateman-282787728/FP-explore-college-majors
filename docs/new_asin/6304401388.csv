867361,3,6304401388,"I'm a sucker for many superhero films, and by buying them, I've been burned by horrible plots, cheap effects, and wooden acting.  While Black Scorpion II isn't at the top of the genre, it really isn't in the ""Batman & Robin bad"" category.
Joan Severance gives a decent, if soap opera-y, performance as the lead, nicely balancing the broader performances by the police squad and villians with her understated acting.  I really liked the look of the film, too.  Superheroes don't look natural in broad daylight as if the sun makes the costumes even more garish than usual, so the film's use of night scenes plays well.
The dvd does have a ""making of the series"" extra hosted by Adam West that talks about the short lived television show.  The only problem I had with it is that I liked the TV actress better than Joan, and would have preferred to see her in the movie!
If you want sensible plots, strong acting, and good special effects, go elsewhere.  Really.  But if you like campiness and slick costumes, knock yourself out.",1018396800,2,1025,4.6353591160221
867362,3,6304401388,"All right, I'll admit the movie itself stunk. But it had one thing going for it: Gangster Prankster! It is, however, a real shame that he is cast in a supporting role to Aftershock. I mean, come on! The Prankster is like Angel City's very own Joker! And I have trouble remembering when the Joker ever, EVER played 2nd bannana to fruitcake like Aftershock. SHE should be working for HIM. See, the way I see it, she is angry over what Mayor Worth did, so she goes to the Prankster he digs her machine out and she helps him hold the city hostage. Even better he uses her machine to cripple the city and he takes over. That's the way it SHOULD have happened. And he got killed off to early. Well, at least the Prankster went down fighting! Aftershock turned good and killed herself for reasons I'm STILL not clear on. Also, it's way to short. Maybe if they had more Gangster Prankster...",994982400,,883,4.390243902439025
867363,1,6304401388,"This is perhaps the worst movie ever made.  While Joan Severance is the most beautiful actress in the world even her looks didn't salvage this terrible movie.  If they had shown some of her body they might have offered  some redemption just from the sex appeal effect alone, but they didn't and  there was no salvation.  I couldn't recommend this to anyone.",949622400,10,357,4.693548387096774
867364,3,6304401388,"This movie comes with a set of poor actors, and very quick scripts and scenes that makes it hard to understand the real problem that Black Scorpion is confronting (Saving the city from an Earthquake.) It's a bad movie but I have seen movies that are worst than this. Joan looks very nice  in BS clothing. I guess I can watch it again if a friend hasn't seen it.  Joan is worth it.",943228800,3,380,4.191780821917808

7870501,3,6304401388,"The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie.  If you were expecting serious crime drama then you're looking in the wrong place.  This is definitely not Black Knight Rises, but if your willing to sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero, a great looking techno-whiz of a car and some fast-paced action you ARE in the right place.

One quick warning for parents out there, this movie is rated ""R"" for good reason.  Since some of the action is from the mind of Roger Corman it can get a little gruesome and sexy at points in this movie so don't let the comic book roots fool you, this is not for the kiddies.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that this 15 year old flic stood up as well as it did.  Not great, not awful, just okay.",1348272000,2,831,4.329032258064516
7870502,5,6304401388,"As a Black Scorpion I think this a fun sequel that has everything I like about the Black Scorpion Tv series (which is available on DVD in an impressive collection): a strong and intelligent heroine, weird but wonderful bad guys, and lots of B-movie/comic strip action. Good fun!",1102464000,6,278,4.8125
7870503,4,6304401388,"When I saw that there was a movie called Black Scorpion 2 I knew that I would have to watch it right away as my wife and I had so enjoyed the first movie.
Joan Severance returns as Darcy Walker, policewoman by day and crime fighter by night.  Although her partner has been recast, almost all of the faces from the first movie have returned, including Garret Morris as Argyle.
The film opens with Darcy tracking down the Gangster Prankster (sort of a cross between the Joker and Two-Face) and then busting him as Black Scorpion.  Meanwhile a woman scientist has come up with a way to neutralize earthquakes and aftershocks.  Unfortunately the Mayor enjoys the federal relief funds that quakes bring in so he sabotages her machine.  The result is that it amplifies the quake and the scientist takes on the identity of Aftershock.  It is up to Black Scorpion to make the streets safe again.
While not quite up to the level of the first film (the fight scenes are almost comical) it was still a fun film and I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the first Black Scorpion film.  I definitely recommend these films to those who like the comic book film genre, although this is not intended for kids (ther is nudity and violence).",1082937600,18,1229,4.538461538461538
