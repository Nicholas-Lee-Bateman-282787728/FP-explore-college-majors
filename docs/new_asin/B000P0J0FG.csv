2807006,5,B000P0J0FG,"Hugh Laurie's milieu is tv, not movies.  Much as I love Laurie, movies are not where he shines.  The tv however was made for him.  Also, he and Stephen Fry were made to partner and they did for a long time, ever since they were students together at Cambridge. For everyone who knows Laurie as only Dr. Gregory House, he is an entirely different performer in both this sketch comedy series and Jeeves & Wooster, both done with Fry. Laurie is both musical and comic on this show.  Fry is not a musician but he is the perfect comedic foil with Laurie.  Laurie is always the one more inclined to play the fool or clown whereas Fry is a bit more the straight man. They both consistently inhabit the world of the absurd. They remind me a bit of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook performing together on tv. If you are American, as am I, it may take you a bit to get into British humor.  However, once you appreciate British humor, it really grows on you so that you love British comedy shows.

2807007,5,B000P0J0FG,"If you have seen other Fry & Laurie bits and like them, you'll also love this. These two are consistent in their ability to be funny. If you have never seen them and are curious, it is very British humor at its best. Hugh Laurie is nothing like Dr House in these DVDs! They are hilarious.",1256688000,,288,4.160714285714286
2807008,3,B000P0J0FG,"I love Fry and Laurie, I own all four discs in this series.  They are one of the greatest British Comedy Teams ever, right up there with Pete and Dud, Smith and Jones, and the Two Ronnies. Season Three features some of the best stuff they've ever done: ""From Here to Just Over There"", ""Tahitian Kitchen"", ""The Red Hat of Patferrick"", and ""The Model Advert"" are priceless.

That said, one of the greatest skits they ever did was when Laurie was singing 'Hey Jude' in a high-pitched chipmunk voice.  Fry joined in the 'Na Na Na's' with a low bull-frog voice.  While this is boldly advertised on the British release of this DVD, it's been completely cut from this version! I know the Beatles' are tough to get the royalties from, but this a bloody shame.  Thank God for YouTube!",1192320000,5,775,4.507142857142857
2807009,5,B000P0J0FG,"Season three of Fry and Laurie is absolutely, brilliantly hilarious!  Better than season two (in my opinion) and more on par with the comic consistency of season one.",1189814400,3,166,4.928571428571429
2807010,5,B000P0J0FG,"When I purchased A Bit of Fry and Laurie Season 3 (and 4) I was incredibly happy. I had waited for ages for it to come to the states, and when it finally did, I ordered it quickly, and it came within the given dates of delivery. What can I say about A Bit of Fry and Laurie except soupy twist!",1188259200,,293,3.819672131147541
2807011,5,B000P0J0FG,"These guys don't disappoint, even the third time around.  The only thing funnier than Hugh Laurie in drag is Fry attempting an American accent.  The usual wordplay, absurdist hijinks, and oddball sketches abound, with just one of the highlights being the ""kickin' a**"" song--hilarious!
  These sketches differ from those in seasons 1 and 2 only in that the opening promo is different and the ending features Fry inventing a bizarre cocktail while Laurie plays piano and makes a horn sound with his mouth.
  If you love these two, rent Black Adder and the whole Jeeves and Wooster series as well.  It would be heavenly if Fry could just guest star on House.....",1185753600,3,660,4.839285714285714

I've bought 3 different ones from 3 different users, all in excellent condition, but none of them will work on my Blu-Ray player or on a DVD player on my laptop.
