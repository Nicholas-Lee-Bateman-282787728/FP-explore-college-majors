8614670,4,B00FDZ7VYU,"Great collection of old films, especially the half that are race car, sports car, hot rod and motorcycle movies.  Not just a chase scene in each, but some are mostly chase scenes.  Some excellent race and chase scenes with authentic vintage vehicles.  The real Barney Oldfield actually shows up in one.  One star off for poor video recording quality.  But the price - about 20 cents per film - tough to complain about that.",1446508800,,423,4.662162162162162
