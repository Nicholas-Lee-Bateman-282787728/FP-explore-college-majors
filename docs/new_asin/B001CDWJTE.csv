Wrote one of the of the other reviewers,
""So why would anyone buy the 2012 issue to get one show when they could have gotten two shows for the same price?""
Packaging these two together is a farce. One--- 'Little Drummer Boy' is a masterpiece. Touching, powerful, funny, fast paced. 'Cricket' is one of the most banal, tedius, forgetable things We've ever suffered through. The animation is third rate, the sings second rate. I can't imagine anyone ever wishing to watch this more than once.",1481673600,,513,4.829545454545454

8287250,5,B001CDWJTE,"It is a difficult to find a Christmas movie for kids that is not about Santa, or elves or other stuff like that.  If you are looking for a movie for kids (and adults) that will focus on the birth of our Savior, look no more.  Little Drummer Boy is funny, moving and profound.  I am always crying by the end, even though I have seen it so many times. It manages to pack a tremendous amount of meaning and depth into a half hour.  I love the claymation animation too.  It is great for all ages.  It is a work of genius!",1363046400,6,517,3.970873786407767
8287251,3,B001CDWJTE,"These two animated/stop-motion movies are not really up to the standard of ""Rudolph,"" ""Frosty"" and the other Rankin/Bass Christmas TV fare from the 60s (maybe that's why they haven't yet made it to BD). I find ""Drummer Boy"" particularly annoying because I can't stand the song upon which it's based.

That said, these are an OK diversion if you're tired of watching and re-watching the better-quality Rankin/Bass TV Xmas shows. One might watch ""Rudolph"" and ""Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town"" 3 or 4 times during the holiday season: these two also-rans probably merit viewing only on even-numbered years.

This is a 2-DVD set with each show occupying its own DVD. The voice talents for the Charles Dickens-based ""Cricket"" (1967) include Danny and Marlo Thomas, as well as Roddy McDowell (as the Cricket), Hans Conried, Paul Frees and Ed Ames, with the Norman Luboff Choir providing the music. ""Drummer Boy"" (1968) features the Vienna Boys Choir singing the soundtrack, with Jos Ferrer as Ben Haramad, Paul Frees as Aaron's Father and Greer Garson as The Storyteller.

Believe me, these shows look better on paper than they are in reality.

Drummer Boy runs 25 minutes while Cricket runs 47 minutes.

I think I paid around $5 for this ClassicMedia DVD set, so WTH?

Definitely not worth the $20 some amazon sellers are asking.

BTW - this set was compiled in 2009. ""Drummer Boy"" was re-released by itself in 2012 in updated DVD packaging, using the same master tape used in this 2009 issue. The 2012 issue of LDB costs the same as does this twofer, which contains two shows. So why would anyone buy the 2012 issue to get one show when they could have gotten two shows for the same price?",1362873600,2,1683,4.762886597938144
8287252,5,B001CDWJTE,My mom lost her Drummer Boy movie and just had to have one for her (90th)birthday. It was a pretty simple gesture to put a smile on her face.,1359158400,2,141,3.896551724137931
8287253,5,B001CDWJTE,"What Christmas Collection would be complete without these 2 wonderful Rankin/Bass classics? The Little Drummer Boy is 1 of my favorites & still is! Cricket on the Hearth, i remember watching this 4 the 1st time when i was in kindergarden, Christmas party B4 the winter break. I really loved it! But then it disappeared 4 a while! I didn't see it till 20 yrs later on tv. But I still remembered how much I enjoyed it & when it was released with the other Original Christmas Classics, U know I went out & bought it. I recently upgraded the Original Christmas Classics on blu ray & was upset 2 find that these 2 wonderful classics weren't there! Thank goodness I found these 2 on a holiday double feature! Hopefully in the future, Classic Media will release these 2 on blu ray + The Little Drummer Boy Book 2!",1290556800,5,806,4.416107382550336
