3527757,5,B001D98U4K,"""America:  Stories of War"" is a huge collection of 36 DVDs, representing over 170 hours (7+ days!!!) of war documentaries and theatrical films dealing with various conflicts throughout America's history.  Attractively packaged in a tin designed to look like an ammo can (complete with battle scars), this collection from Mill Creek Entertainment assembles two of their sets in a single, larger package, including a documentary set that's also titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America-Stories-of-War/dp/B001E67VGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America Stories of War</a>&nbsp;and a 50 movie set titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Combat-Classics-50-MoviePack/dp/B0014CCPP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Combat Classics 50 MoviePack</a>.

The documentaries are spread over 24 single-sided DVDs and cover the following:

* The Civil War (10 documentary segments)
* World War I (10 segments)
* World War II (91 segments)
* The Korean War (32 segments)
* The Vietnam War (51 segments)

One might quibble about the exclusion, especially, of the Revolutionary War and other conflicts such as the War of 1812, the Spanish-American War, and the current War in Iraq, but with nearly 200 documentary segments included for the five conflicts listed above, it's easy to overlook these omissions.  There's also a certain amount of propaganda throughout some of the documentaries, but that's largely overshadowed by some extraordinary images captured by numerous combat photographers.

Both the Civil War and World War I documentaries were produced by Creation Films and are of recent vintage, carrying a 2008 copyright date (the only licensed material in this otherwise public domain collection).  As I viewed the Civil War documentary segments, they reminded me of a poor man's version of ""Ken Burns' The Civil War"" that was broadcast on PBS.  While the production values aren't in the same class as the Burns film, the narration is compelling in its own way and, after a slow start, I found myself thoroughly engrossed in the material.  The World War I documentaries fare a bit better; motion picture cameras had been developed by that time and cameras were taken into battle.  I hadn't heard about Creation Films before watching these two documentaries, but despite what must have been a modest budget, the documentaries are well done and I'd be interested in seeing other documentaries that the company might produce in the future.

The World War II segments comprise the largest portion of the documentaries and include some notable documentaries that were developed for television, including NBC's Emmy award winning ""Victory at Sea"" (yes, the original Richard Rodgers/Robert Russell Bennett score is intact), ""Crusade in Europe,"" which was one of the earliest war documentary series developed for television, running on ABC from May to October of 1949, and ""Crusade in the Pacific,"" a syndicated series.  All of the World War II films that were part of Frank ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Capra's ""Why We Fight"" series are also included in this grouping.

Many of the Korean War segments are from yet another television documentary series, ""The Big Picture,"" that ran on ABC from 1953 to 1959.  This series was produced by the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense.  Likewise, the Vietnam War segments are also government productions, but some of the segments are in color.

The films selection is a decidedly mixed bag as the films included consist of older films that have slipped into the public domain due mainly to lapses in copyright registrations.  There are some bonafide classics and near classics in this group, including ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"" and ""The Immortal Battalion"" (both British films made during the years of World War II), as well as ""Go for Broke"" and ""Blood on the Sun,"" among a few others.  But the vast majority of the films are B-movie programmers from the U.S., England, and Europe that were produced between the 1930s and 1980s.  There are even a few made-for-TV movies in the mix, including ""The Black Brigade"" a/k/a ""Carter's Army"" and ""Hitler's SS:  Portrait in Evil.""  The bulk of these films are focused during the World War II era, but a few films like ""Drums in the Deep South"" and ""Hearts in Bondage"" are set in the Civil War era and then there's the odd film like ""Eagle in a Cage"" that tells the story of Napoleon's exile and ""The Mark of the Hawk,"" a drama that uses an African uprising as its backdrop.

The films appear to be unrestored, but are in relatively good shape.  However, most of the discs have four films on a single side, so there is some occasional digital breakup/blurring in scenes where there is a lot of motion, due to the compression of so many films on each disc.  But, considering that a collection like this is the only way that many of these older films will ever see a release on DVD, they are generally acceptable.

The challenge for many purchasers of this set will be finding time to view the many hours that are included in this collection and, in fact, this is one of the few times where it's fair to say that this collection offers years of viewing pleasure.  In fact, this set is so large that viewers will need to pace themselves, perhaps watching a film each week along with several of the documentary segments.  Veterans, military enthusiasts and those interested in a visual history of America's conflicts will find much to like in this set.  While the documentary segments (comprising two-thirds of this set) rate an easy *****, the theatrical film selection isn't quite up to scratch and, as such, my overall rating for the set is closer to **** & .",1232409600,155,5715,5.1949891067538125
3527758,5,B001D98U4K,"AMERICA: STORIES OF WAR 36 DVD COLLECTION from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT combines their previously issued&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-disc-war-documentary-set/dp/B001E67VGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 disc war documentary set</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COMBAT-CLASSICS-50-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B0014CCPP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COMBAT CLASSICS 50 MOVIE PACK</a>, for a total of 170-plus hours of programming. Several of the documentaries included here are licensed exclusively to this manufacturer. Audio and video transfer quality is generally quite good, but does depend in some cases on condition of vintage stock footage.

This unique package consists of discs stored in heavy black paper envelopes; each has a circular-shaped cellophane window on one side for quick identification of the dvds. The set's container is a well-constructed olive drab tin replica of an ammunition box. The hinged lid is held securely closed at one narrow end by a spring-loaded clasp. It also has an attached lunch box style handle for easy transport. Opening the top reveals an insert photo of loose copper-tipped ammo. Flip this up for access to DVDs and a 40-page contents booklet.

3527759,2,B001D98U4K,This is primarily a collection of powerpoints-gone-DVD with a lifeless narrator. I am a huge fan of WWII material and this really fell short. Save your money for documentaries made by the big guys.,1361923200,4,197,4.823529411764706

3527765,3,B001D98U4K,"This collection of DVD's is an awesome collection.  It is unbelievably detailed in many of the documentaries that are included along with the 6 or so full length movies.  My issue is this:  While I understand that packaging 36 DVD's is difficult, storing them in a oddly shaped tin box in DVD sleeves is highly inconvienent and practically non-practical on many shelves.

For the cost, this is a really good deal.  There is much history here and some very interesting and moving stories.  I liked the inclusion of the military action in Korea (the forgotten war). The volume of films is impressive....hours, day and weeks of viewing, and the ammo can is clever.  All in all, this is well worth the money.",1330387200,4,481,4.6117647058823525

8292375,3,B001D98U4K,"I bought this for my father, who is an aging WWII veteran.  My first problem is that he doesn't like to be reminded of the war in that he lost so many friends in it (my error), my second was that there is NO close captioning done, which is almost mandatory for any movie my father watches.

I have watched a few of them and find the historical information fantastic.  Although I have watched just a few myself, I also found informative some of the critiques on the actual content (Civil War info great, WWI announcer bad but content good, WWII excellent, Korean & Vietnam good except government produced propaganda) Would really like to keep this set for that reason as I think it is a real value for the right audience, however aging WWII vet's are apparently not that audience with no closed captioning.

8292376,3,B001D98U4K,"There is much here.  The Civil War videos were good, as they take the viewer through the war with re-enactments and photos.  Fair, even-handed and informative, as well as entertaining.

The World War I portion was easily the WORST of the lot.  It had a chance to be very good, but they employ a narrator who clearly was over his head with this assignment.  If you want to describe the First World War, you had better be comfortable pronouncing the names of French, Russian and German generals and statesmen, as well place names.  If not, get some help with people who do.  I found myself getting constantly distracted with the awful mis-pronunciations, and that made it hard to enjoy the films, which otherwise actually included some great footage.  (Maybe I should listen with the sound turned down?)

The World War II discs were clearly the best.  I'll take off a few points for the propaganda, but the footage was spectacular, and many included some very useful maps and diagrams which helped understand some of the progress of the war, especially on the Pacific side.

Both the Korea and Vietnam films were marred by the fact that they were all made by the government, and (like WWII) made contemporary to the war.  But once again, some great footage, and there was much to be both informative and entertaining.",1369958400,6,1315,4.744493392070485
