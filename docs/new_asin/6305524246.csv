Cheaply made, deceiving description. The video is all in slow motion. There is only one very edited scene.
Very un-happy. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO.",1064620800,2,209,4.675675675675675
7891981,1,6305524246,"First, they ""interview"" five ""teachers"" who are really nude models.  They come from all parts of the US, but all squirm around and take off the top of their nighty (but not the bottom)on the same red satin sheet, under the same wall print.  Their answers to the questions reveals that each has an IQ of 63 or less.
Then they each perform a pseudo strip on the same cheapo classroom set--a small desk, globe, folding chair.  It seems that each must have gone to the same plastic surgeon, for their boobs look exactly alike, except for the black model, whose are bigger.  Even their body hair has been shaved to look exactly alike.
But the film is politically correct: there is one Asian model, one black model, and three white models.  Wonderful.
There is no plot, just a bunch of extremely badly edited takes that jump back and forth, apparently to deliberately spoil the realism, since the whole film is the same.  I finally got bored after the first five minutes and fast forwarded through the whole thing.  Only 59 minutes of ...  ...
Not worth thinking about twice, much less spending valuable time and effort, and money, on it.  Probably the worst erotic video I've ever seen.  Everyone connected with this film should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.",1031788800,34,1260,4.6863636363636365
