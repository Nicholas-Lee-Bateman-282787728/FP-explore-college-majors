8334192,5,B001PPLKOO,LOVE FRENCH AND SAUNDERS!!! This is a must have for any French and Saunders fan!,1416182400,,80,4.4
8334193,5,B001PPLKOO,"This is by far one of their best live shows!! I love it! I wish they would do more stand up or live stuff together, they're just so funny! If you love French and Saunders this is a must have for your collection. Compared to their later live shows, this is more like stand up with banter between them more than a tv episode. 5 out of 5!",1407888000,,335,3.9411764705882355
8334194,3,B001PPLKOO,"I am a huge fan of French & Saunders! There has never been a female comedy duo like these two funny Brits! They never fail to make me laugh! That said, the reason I am only giving this dvd an 'It's okay.' rating is because of the poor sound and video quality. I have the other 'live' dvd of F & S and it is much, much better in the sound and visual areas. If you are a fan of F & S, then this dvd is a must for you. It shows these two funny ladies early in their careers. It's nice to see how they have grown in their comedy routines over the years. They just get funnier and funnier over the years!",1365984000,,599,3.8
8334195,5,B001PPLKOO,"Best of all. I laughed so hard it hurt (I recently had spinal surgery) and had to turn it off for an hour until the pain went away. So funny I nearly peed myself!  Jeez, this is one funny show.",1365465600,,193,3.825
8334196,5,B001PPLKOO,How can you not like French and Saunders! They are hilarious. I love how each one has had success on their own too.,1361750400,,115,4.043478260869565
8334197,5,B001PPLKOO,"They are just nuts!  Not their finest, but who cares?  Their worst is better than many at their best!  Just a crazy good time!",1360022400,,126,4.166666666666667
8334198,5,B001PPLKOO,"The picture quality looks like a stage performance filmed in 1990, so not quite as clear as something that would be filmed today, but the pictures on the case are much worse than on the actual dvd. I think this dvd is great for any F&S fan. If you haven't seen the original series a few of these sketches will be new to you. There are no special features (just ""Play"" ""Chapters"" ""Bio's""), but it's French and Saunders. I recommend it!",1242691200,2,434,4.37037037037037
8334199,5,B001PPLKOO,"This is the 1990 Tour when F&S were at the peak of their popularity. First time on DVD and only previously available on VHS in the UK, which has been out of print since the 1990's. Extremely funny and one of the best bits about this show is the raw performace, with very few props and sets. Unlike their later 2 live shows which rely heaviy on recycled TV material this show is more like a proper stand-up double act with original sktches which unilize the old energy between Dawn & Jennifer. Worth buying. Let's hope we get some extra matrial & bonus features included in this release.",1240272000,6,586,4.435185185185185
8334200,5,B001PPLKOO,"French and Saunders are the funniest! You should watch all their DVD's, all their TV and anything you can find. I found AB FAB, VICAR and Clatterford great along with their comedy specials, F&S Live!",1235001600,3,199,4.714285714285714
