Classic longboard action by the original pioneers.
I can watch this stuff for hours.....",1319500800,5,141,5.173913043478261
3648552,3,B001IFZL8C,"Im So Used To Watching Bruce Brown Surf Films So It Was Nice To Switch It Up And See What Other Independent Surf Directors Where Doing, The Walt Phillips Collection Was A Good Pick, Lot's Of Classic Surf Footage From The Early Days! As You Would Expect When Purchasing Late 50s Early 60's Surf Films!
My Favorite Of The 4 Films Is ""Psych Out"" Because About 40 Out Of The 50 Minutes Of The Movie Is The Original Narration And Includes Some Great Instrumental Surf/Pre Surf Music! The Other Films Are Good With The Newer Narrations, But I Prefer To Hear It As It Was Originally Done, And The Music On The Other Films Is Really Bad!
All In All, A Good Purchase If You've Got A Craving For The Original Surf Films!",1317168000,,710,4.345864661654136
3648553,5,B001IFZL8C,"I always wondered why the new surf movies can't stand up to the old movies of the sixties. The new surfers are clearly phenomenal and the feats they do are unbelievable. But ""that thing""- gliding along the water- is more evident in the old movies. It's like flying and walking on water at the same time. Also the old movies had better music. Alas, it was pirated and played without royalties, but that's why it was so good.
  John Severson's ""Surf Safari"" was the greatest surf movie ever made. It taught one to love Classical music. What a shame it was lost.
  Classic Surf Films is a good replacement. Put in your own sound track, do your own narration, and bingo, 1957!",1304294400,7,672,4.483606557377049
3648554,5,B001IFZL8C,"I really enjoyed this film. many memories, all good ones!!
A time gone by, treasured by all who live through it. thanks for the creation of this dvd.",1299110400,,149,4.357142857142857
3648555,5,B001IFZL8C,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the footage in these four surfing films, considering their age (I would like to know exactly when the footage was shot).  The films do have some scratches and spots, but are still very watchable.  Each film has its own disc but there are no special features.  ""Sunset Surf Craze,"" ""Surf Mania,"" and Psyche Out"" are full screen and have narration, identifying the locations and surfers, and providing other information.  ""Once Upon a Wave"" is widescreen and has no narration.  The soundtrack music is good and appropriate for the films.

Sunset Surf Craze - aproximately 47 minutes, ?? seconds
Surf Mania - approximately 47 minutes, 39 seconds
Psyche Out - approximately 50 minutes, 11 seconds
Once Upon a Wave - approximately 47 minutes, 57 seconds",1280016000,25,793,4.96969696969697
8310939,5,B001IFZL8C,"A superb collection of 50's/60's longboarding history. lots of early Hawaii: Sunset , Makaha , Haleiwa. Great to see these movies again after so long.",1437609600,,150,5.04
8310940,5,B001IFZL8C,"Fun to see old friends and remember ""the good old days"" when surfing was not a frenzied ""crowd scene"". DO NOT expect ""Hollyweird"" quality, just purchase it for the sheer enjoyment and love of surfing.",1425945600,,200,4.742857142857143
8310941,4,B001IFZL8C,Really Strong!,1424822400,,14,6.5
8310942,5,B001IFZL8C,Whats not to like from a guy that was a 60's gremmie in So Cal? Great price and smart compact packaging.,1420588800,,104,4.0
8310943,5,B001IFZL8C,just as described,1416528000,,17,5.0
8310944,4,B001IFZL8C,"If you're a longboarder, you'll love these old flicks filled with all the usual suspects. For the price, you can't go wrong (unless they've jacked it up to 50 bucks or something)",1360281600,,178,4.59375
8310945,3,B001IFZL8C,"I like surfing and I like history, so these videos seemed like a good idea.  They're OK, with some good waves and surfers from 50 years ago.  Not quite the same quality as Bruce Brown's or Greg Noll's work from the same general era, however.",1353456000,,241,4.333333333333333
8310946,5,B001IFZL8C,I loved the old vintage films. It was great to see Steamer Lane back in the day when I surfed there in the early 60's. Outstanding old surf films. Much better then I expected.,1352246400,,175,4.176470588235294
8310947,3,B001IFZL8C,"If you can recall gathering at the local beach-side firehouse and watching surf flicks with a room full of similalry stoked buddies than these films will resonate. The quality is suspect but typical for the era and the dialougue is predictably cheesy. With that said, there is some great footage of skillful longboard surfing and shots of breaks that have sadly been lost to ""progress"".",1335225600,3,386,4.953846153846154
8310948,3,B001IFZL8C,When surf films were first coming out some photogs had a knack for editing and splicing. This film kinda looks like left over or cutting room floor footage. I still enjoy seeing some of the old surf spots before they were changed (before developers).It brings back old memories. Some of its fun to watch.,1330300800,,304,4.648148148148148
