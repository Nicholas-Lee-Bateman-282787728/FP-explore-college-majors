7149102,5,B00WR534NQ,I was given the opportunity to view this first video via Answers in Genesis.  The photography is mind blowing.  The video moves along quickly and gives you a desire to know more.  What an incredible upbringing these children are having.  The experiences are molding them to excellence and an asset to any community.,1452902400,,315,4.886792452830188

7149104,5,B00WR534NQ,Great video bought them for my grandkids but the adults enjoy them just as much as the kids.  The boys model wonderful character traits without being too cheesy.  Excellent guality!  Please make more.,1443398400,4,200,5.0
7149105,5,B00WR534NQ,"I so enjoyed this short video on the lives of these ""wild"" boys! It made us see missionaries as real people living real lives just in extraordinary places sometimes. My only complaint is I wanted more! I see they have another video out though! Be inspired, laugh, and thankful to God as you watch His work in this families life!",1438732800,2,328,4.483333333333333
8713992,5,B00WR534NQ,Movie was in great condition but only one episode is on DVD. Wish there were more episodes on disc.,1520035200,,99,4.2631578947368425

8713994,4,B00WR534NQ,An excellent movie demonstrating a Christian worldview that we showed to our grandchildren. Our young granddaughter enjoyed it more than her brother--maybe not sophisticated enough for him. Too bad that he is growing up too quickly and is too picky.,1493078400,,249,5.25
8713995,5,B00WR534NQ,"This episode is very much an introduction to the Wild Brother's. It focuses on each of the boys (personality/interests) it shows their parents who tell the story of how they came to be missionaries in that location. You see some of the locals and a quick overview of how the Gospel is presented and how they serve the people there. You also see a little of how they built their house and an airstrip.
There were a few interesting things that more tender viewers might find... gross. A native boy is eating the brain of an animal. (It was hilarious to watch the Wild boys try it!) They also talk about tribal wars and how one of their friends got shot with an arrow which showed a tiny fast clip of them administering first aid. (mostly a glimpse of flashlights and rubber gloves.) And there's a bonus feature clip of the boys skinning this giant snake, but the youngest Wild boy says you can't be a sissy when it comes to skinning snakes. (:
Overall I really liked the insight it gave into missionary life, they didn't paint it up to be all rosy and exciting. They shared how it was a lot of hard work and gave all credit to the Lord.",1490140800,,1134,4.328638497652582

8713999,3,B00WR534NQ,The content was awesome but 28 minutes?! Really? I should have looked before I purchased but the price usually is for movies 2-4hours long and longer when a show or season. I would NOT purchase if I had to do it over again for this price. Very disappointed on how little they included. Wait for a sale!,1467763200,12,302,4.315789473684211
8714000,4,B00WR534NQ,We loved this movie just wish it was longer!,1463011200,2,44,4.0
