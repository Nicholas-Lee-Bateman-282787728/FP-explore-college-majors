I waited a long time for this event to come out on a DVD, and I bought it the moment it did, so I'm very happy.
Recomend for every Psych or Twin Peaks fan!",1371859200,7,197,3.7142857142857144
5710390,5,B00CAYSJNE,"Ray wise was genius, extremely funny.  There were a lot of interesting tidbits about Twin Peaks that I didn't know about.  Cute stories about all their reunions on the Psych set and how it was to work with the Psych cast.  James Roday was hilarious as always. A great episode to review on stage - Dual Spires.  Always a favorite.  I recommend this for any Psych or Twin Peak fan.",1371686400,8,379,4.357142857142857
5710391,5,B00CAYSJNE,"If you're a fan of Psych and/or Twin Peaks, this is an interesting hour discussing the phenomenon that was Twin Peaks and the Psych episode, ""Dual Spires"" which was a clever and fun homage to David Lynch's foray into network television. If you haven't already seen ""Dual Spires,"" I would recommend watching it before listening to this moderated discussion, and if you're a Psych fan who never saw Twin Peaks, go watch that first so you can fully appreciate what a great job the Psych cast and crew did. Keep in mind the emphasis is on Twin Peaks, so if you are looking for lots of detail about Psych, you are better off watching the excellent commentaries on the Psych DVDs, but fans of both shows will enjoy hearing these actors talk about this collaboration and the show that inspired it.",1371686400,15,790,4.609929078014185

5710424,3,B00CAYSJNE,"For such a funny show this was rather dry.  It had some interesting moments, and I was intrigued by the connections between the two shows.  Of course, the Psych homage episode, ""Twin Spires"" was amazing and very funny.",1400198400,,218,4.7105263157894735
5710425,5,B00CAYSJNE,It was a very interesting panel to learn psych and Twin Peaks  facts and whatnot. Five star rating for sure.,1389657600,,108,4.4
5710426,5,B00CAYSJNE,"Totally enjoyed it! Went to a community ""Lakeland Ohio"" . The entire time we were there my husband constantly said he  felt like we wrer in ""Dual Spires"". He's too young for twin peaks.",1389139200,2,185,4.4411764705882355
5710427,3,B00CAYSJNE,"I really can't rate it fairly.  I don't know what Twin Peaks is.  I wanted to watch Psych, but it's not included on Amazon Prime.",1388880000,,129,4.12
5710428,3,B00CAYSJNE,"The episode itself was excellent.. this retrospective, not so much.  The interviewer didn't keep things moving, so the pacing was slow.  This was funny at times, and not bad by any means,",1380931200,,187,4.8125
5710429,5,B00CAYSJNE,"Any fan of Twin Peaks and/or Psych will enjoy this. The panel was missing a lot of people (like Kyle MacLachlen, Sherilyn Fenn) but it was great panel.",1377648000,,151,4.428571428571429
5710430,4,B00CAYSJNE,"The show was really fun, made me want to rewatch TWIN PEAKS and DUAL SPIRES again! But the host was a MUMBLER!  :-(",1373500800,4,115,4.0
5710431,3,B00CAYSJNE,"Well, honestly I think I would have loved it, however I could not hear what they were saying and there was no Closed Caption available.  I am old and my daughter wears hearing aids so we were kind of lost the whole time.  Thanks for trying.  Hey to James Roday and Dule Hill!!",1372982400,2,276,4.169811320754717

8579464,3,B00CAYSJNE,"Hard core Twin Peaks' fans will eat this up, but others will find it down in the one or two star variety. The production seemed somewhat scattered where a viewer might have preferred more direct questioning and insights on David Lynch vs. giggles and Trix. The Log Lady stars along with Sheryl Lee in this consortium.",1460332800,2,317,4.678571428571429

8579468,2,B00CAYSJNE,"I had to stop watching.  Unscripted, Jane's Roday is boring and so twitchy.. constantly fiddling with his little beard or drinking from his water bottle.
Dule Hill was barely acknowledged. Not very interesting.",1418688000,,210,5.363636363636363
