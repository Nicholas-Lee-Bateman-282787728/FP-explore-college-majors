8669908,5,B006995K2O,I can't say enough about the bumble bee series. It was recommended to me by a friend who had a child with speech delay. My son loves it. It certainly captures his attention and my son has learned so many new words. I highly recommend this video to anyone who has a child with speech delay.,1436832000,2,289,4.178571428571429
