4934794,4,B00632KTKK,"Slasher films are generally all the same...especially the ""Nightmare"" and ""Friday"" series.

""Freddy vs. Jason"" was a long-awaited, much-anticipated film and it is what it is:  a BAD movie that pitted two of the greatest Slasher film serial killers against each other.  Bad acting, poor direction, and a super-shallow script pretty much sums up the quality of this film.  Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it!  Lol!

""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is the 2010 reimagining of the film series starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger.  Jackie is a TREMENDOUS (and terribly underrated) character actor who can play virtually any character he plays in a very convincing manner.  However, he's no Freddy Krueger.  No one is, really, except Robert Englund, who played Freddy for every film before this one.  The script was typical ""Nightmare,"" and it was neat to see the filmmakers delve into Freddy's past a bit more, but I was just horribly disappointed in the portrayal of Freddy onscreen.  Disappointing.

""Friday the 13th"" was also a modern-day remake/imagining of the classic 1980s slasher series.  Generally, remakes make me cringe, but this one hit it out of the park.  Marcus Nispel, who also directed the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake a few years prior to this film did a truly inspiring remake.  Yes, it had just enough classic ""Friday"" nudity, awful deaths, and shallow characters, but this one actually had a little more of a story and better casting than previous ""Friday"" films.  Jason was also MUCH more believable as well.  He actually comes across as a ""real"" person, as opposed to an unkillable ""demon"" from the later Friday films.  Lots of great kills, great cinematography, and a Jason with a brain/depth makes this an enjoyable film.  This film is worth purchasing this BluRay on its own.

Good times in old slasherville, with the exception of ""Nightmare 2010.""  Recommended for horror fans!",1403222400,9,1906,5.044871794871795

4934799,1,B00632KTKK,"Friday the 13th remake - Terrible!

Nightmare On Elm Street remake - Even Worse!

Freddy Vs Jason - turns 2 of America's most popular horror creations into comedic cartoonish versions of themselves.

Now you can have all three of these jokes of films on a BluRay together!! The only thing I don't understand is why this item is listed under Horror rather than Comedy.",1333065600,3,367,4.703125
4934800,4,B00632KTKK,"The item arrived factory sealed as advertised, and the discs themselves are all fine, but I took a star off because the case had a giant cut on the back that went all the way through the plastic and paper and through the case. The case can be opened and closed fine, but it's still disappointing to have an ugly slash in it.",1466553600,,324,4.158730158730159
4934801,5,B00632KTKK,All these reviews from 3 stars and below are complaining and don't know nothing. If your a big fan then you should've known what you bought.

4934807,2,B00632KTKK,The movies Ive already seen so this isn't about that. I didn't like that the cover was creased and worn and didn't look new. The case is smaller than standard including the insert and just simply doesn't look genuine. Return.,1444435200,,225,4.65

4934816,3,B00632KTKK,Freddy vs. is the only original movie on this set everything else is restarts of ffriday the 13th and nightmare on elm street like others I thought it was the originals. It should say on the front that these are the new series of those titals.,1418083200,,243,4.304347826086956
4934817,2,B00632KTKK,"The Nightmare on Elm Street is NOT the original version. I bough this to replace my original version thinking I'd be getting a great deal on 3 movies, and was sadly disappointed. Buyer beware. Perhaps I should have looked more closely at the other reviews. It's based upon Wes Cravens ORIGINAL version. So I feel it's a cheap knock off. The Freddy was pretty cheap looking compared to the original.
But all things considered, if you're ok with a knock off version, it's a good value for 3 movies.",1414972800,,496,4.584269662921348

8491745,5,B00632KTKK,Friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street are Idenical to their individual blu-ray releases. The special features are exactly the same. Freddy vs. Jason is a little different. It doesn't have an interactive menu like it does on the individual release but it does include the same special features minus the film's theatrical trailer and tv spots.,1467417600,2,348,5.017241379310345
