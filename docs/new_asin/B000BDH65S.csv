2414615,2,B000BDH65S,"This is one of the nerdiest music critique DVD's ever.  If you want to see and listen to a group of unabashed Queen lovers talk about the early Queen albums/songs, this DVD is for you.  If you want to see early concert footage, look elsewhere.  The concert footage of portions of ""Keep Yourself Alive"" and ""Stone Cold Crazy"" is the best 5 minutes of the DVD.  Other footage is mostly dubbed over with the studio recording, and all footage is constantly interupted by the bantering Queen lovers.  The guitar guy is pretty interesting, but overall I would say get together with your old Queen listening buddies and reminisce, it's cheaper.",1170460800,,637,4.754545454545455
2414616,5,B000BDH65S,"I thought, being a huge Queen fan, that I would be bored because I knew everything there is to know about the band. But, I was pleasantly surprised from footage, interviews and information that even I didn't know. It would make a Queen fan very happy, indeed.",1167782400,2,259,4.531914893617022
2414617,4,B000BDH65S,"The Reviewers on this DVD present the listeners with a wealth of their knowledge regarding QUEEN.  It is more than just interesting and informing.  The Band looks at their best, they sound great as always, and the films of the Band are sharp and well done.

As always, everyone in our world is a critic. However...I wouldn't part with this DVD of QUEEN.  It's a treasure!  I look forward to receiving the 2nd of this DVD set from Amazon.

2414618,1,B000BDH65S,"Man, this dvd sucked. I thought it'd listen to the reviews given by amazon buyers. But boy was I wrong! This is the worst dvd ever! These are only opinions. Some of the dates for the albums are wrong and nothing is accurate. Except for the OBVIOUS stuff. So do not buy this!(...). (...) When will they release a REAL, Queen documentary?",1143417600,12,336,4.435483870967742
2414619,4,B000BDH65S,"I found this quite entertaining...it gives a ""critic's eye"" view of Queen...step by step.  Very illuminating!",1140652800,3,109,5.8125
2414620,5,B000BDH65S,"Not your normal look at the life of the band but more a focus on their music. A group of well known artists and music insiders basically review the bands music and analyse it,  mainly the 1970s. The film also includes some great early footage of Queen and has some fantastic interview clips from that time. I enjoyed this film immensely and would recommend it to any Queen fan!!",1137542400,5,378,4.478260869565218

8085567,2,B000BDH65S,"The history of Queen told by two Freddie Mercury impersonators and many journalists who never met the man. Very little actual music critique is included apart from historical facts about the financial success of each album and tour. While the film goes in chronological order, the photos shown are very out of order. A few dates are inaccurate. They completely skip over an entire album.

Is this essential viewing for a Queen fan? I don't believe so. Many other DVDs do a much better job of explaining this story with people who were actually present at the time.

I would have given this 1 star, but it did actually include some Queen music and live footage.",1420588800,,660,4.681034482758621

8085571,5,B000BDH65S,"Obviously if you are reading this you are a Queen fan or have a friend or family member who is. You (or they) will not be disappointed with this purchase. I always think I have heard everything about the band, but this video continued to shine light on new pieces of information I hadn't known.

Also, as much as I absolutely think Freddie Mercury ""made"" the band, I always felt kind of bad that most biographies or documentaries focused almost entirely on him. This was not the case with this video. Of course there will always be a lean towards, Mercury, but this video did a great job of talking about some of the other members: especially Brian May and how/why his sound was so unique.

In addition to talking about (and to) the band, they also include commentary for various professionals in the music industry (now and then) who offer their opinions on different songs, albums and moments in the band's history.

Highly recommend. Let me know what you think.",1391385600,4,964,4.625730994152047
8085572,5,B000BDH65S,"Freddie Mercury is a force of Nature. But what do you do with such a force when discovered? That's what this documentary is about: you surround him by other forces of Nature in Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon...the sum of which known as The Queen.",1371340800,2,256,4.468085106382978
8085573,5,B000BDH65S,"It detailed how they began and I loved the demonstrations of how Brian May plays certain songs on the guitar even if Brian wasn't the person playing.  Unlike other documentaries, this one actually played Queen music throughout.",1365638400,,227,5.135135135135135
