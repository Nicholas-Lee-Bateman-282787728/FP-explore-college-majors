8657906,5,B00KDQTROQ,"I had my first guitar fingerpicking lesson from Rolly more years ago than I care to admit. I bought this to fill in some of the blanks in my technique developed over time because of wanting to find my own way. That works to a point. ;-)

Rolly is an excellent teacher as well as a fantastic guitar player - really knows the instrument and communicates it clearly.",1513468800,,363,4.338235294117647
