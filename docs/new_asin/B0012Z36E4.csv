3100337,5,B0012Z36E4,What a joy to learn so much about tracing our roots and finding where we have really descended from.  How rich a heritage.  Greatful for it and you will be too!!!,1247443200,2,162,4.193548387096774

3100341,5,B0012Z36E4,"After 40 years of knowing that I was an American of Scottish descent with the looks and the family tree to substantiate it, my sister unveils that I (we) are one-quarter French! What a shock and also a pleasant surprise. I don't look the least bit French, but suddenly in one minute,I am! How does this change my perspective on myself? Well, can you imagine having been certain all your life that you were African-American and part Indian only to find out that you are actually more white than you are either of the other two strains of humanity? I must say, that PBS has outdone itself this time!

3100342,5,B0012Z36E4,"If you have followed the PBS 4 hour mini-series ""African American Lives 2"" this February, then you will want to purchase the DVD I am certain. This amazingly well documented and directed expose of 12 ""black"" people, including the likes of Pop Diva Icon Tina Turner,comedian Chris Rock,everybody's favorite narrator Morgan Freeman,actor Don Cheadle as well as historians,preachers and Harvard Professors,whose racial identity is disclosed to them through court documents,wills,ship manifests and the newest advances in DNA technology yielding surprises beyond belief to them as well as myself!!!
Who we are is simply not that easy to say. Where we come from is not as simple as black or white. What is being ""black"" anyway? What is being ""white""? What do you do with information when culture tells you that you are one ""race"", but DNA tells you either way more or the opposite? These are the complex questions that are answered in great detail for these 12 people,identified as ""black"" or ""African-American."" (Frankly, this is so interesting that any ""race"" will benefit immensely from this documentary film!)

This documentary brilliantly is non-biased and quite moving. See how Don Cheadle reacts when he finds that his family was owned by Native Americans!!!! Tina Turner is one third European and NO Native American blood! Chris Rock is 1/5 ""white""! There is even the authoress Briss Bryson who has always been ""white"" who discovers that she has more African blood than most ""negroes""!!!! What do we do with such information? Does it change who we are,or does it complete who we are? Henry Gates,Harvard Professor is 50% Irish, and yet has always identified as ""African."" African-American Radio personality Tom Joyner is overwhelmed when he sees a painting of his 5th-great grandfather, a white Supreme Court Judge who has the exact same grey eyes. This stuff is overwhelming! Lots of myths are dispelled about certain long held beliefs about slavery. Others are confirmed. Did all blacks come from slavery? No. Did ""free blacks"" live in the Old South-overwhelmingly! Anyone interested in their heritage, whatever it may be, will be touched and challenged to dig into their past and ask questions about whence they came. Will what you find,though, affect where you are going?
 A fascinating companion film to this would be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontline-By-PBS-Jefferson-s-Blood/dp/B000MBY044/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontline By PBS ; Jefferson's Blood</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/African-American-Lives/dp/B000E6EHNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">African American Lives</a>.I cannot give a higher recommendation for purchase than this documentary.
