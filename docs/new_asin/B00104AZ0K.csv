The Begleys Hit It Big
By Tommy Garrett
Feb 17, 2008 - 1:39:07 PM

Living with Ed, the first season of the hit Home and Garden series starring Ed Begley, Jr. and his gorgeous wife Rachelle - will be released in April on DVD.  Every show from Grey's Anatomy to Desperate Housewives has been put on DVD, but this is a show that is not only fun and entertaining but informative as well.  You get to see the madcap relationship between Ed and Rachelle, while guests like Jay Leno, the silent gardener Chris Houchin, Bill Nye the Science Guy, and yours truly making appearances as well.  Rachelle and Ed were kind enough to ask me to do the season finale of the first season, so if you did not get to see me, here's your chance.

Rachelle Carson Begley is one of the most talented and versatile leading ladies in Hollywood.  She is not only stunning, but she has great comedic timing and would have to be good to work opposite her husband, the most prolific actor of this generation.  Ed's done everything from Sitcoms to Drama.  Playing the evil doctor in Stephen King's Kingdom Hall to a handsome brilliant surgeon in the eighties hit, Saint Elsewhere.  But the natural and easy going environmentalist drives his wife and daughter crazy saving the world, one drop of water or one watt of light at a time.

Season one got great acclaim by the critics and was one of HGTV's highest rated shows ever.  This six episode DVD set is well worth the great price it's offered currently on Amazon and if you pick it up, you'll not only be entertained by the Ricardo's, oops the Begley's, but you will also learn a lot about conservation.  For those who wonder what my talent was on the show, I get to be Rachelle's fashion designer and show everyone how to ship eggs in the mail.  Ed was not amused!

Then there is Living like Ed. No, no, not on Television or DVD, but Ed's recent book about how everyone can save energy and do so easily.  The book published by Clarkson Potter is now available in bookstores everywhere.  Begley has always been known as an excellent actor, but he is now going to become a bestselling author as well.

A committed environmentalist for more than 30 years, Ed Begley, Jr., has always tried to ""live simply so others may simply live."" Now, as more and more of us are looking for ways to reduce our impact on the planet and live a better, greener life, Ed shares his experiences on what works, what doesn't-and what will save you money!

These are tips for environmentally friendly living that anyone-whether you own or rent, live in a private home or a condo-can try to make a positive change for the environment. From quick fixes to bigger commitments and long-term strategies, Ed will help you make changes in every part of your life.

And if you think living green has to mean compromising on aesthetics or comfort, fear not; Ed's wife, Rachelle, insists on style-with a conscience. In Living like Ed, his environmentalism and her design savvy combine to create a guide to going green that keeps the chic in eco-chic.

From recycling more materials than you ever thought possible to composting without raising a stink to buying an electric car, Living Like Ed is packed with ideas-from obvious to ingenious-that will help you live green, live responsibly, live well. Like Ed.

Both Living with Ed on DVD and Living like Ed SB - by Clarkson Potter Publisher are available to order today on Amazon.",1203206400,14,3432,4.57516339869281

Living with Ed gives you an overview of many ways that you could live green. As you may notice, some of them are practical and others are quite expensive. Yet in the long run even the expensive ones are not that expensive because by downsizing the house there is money left over to be able to put into technologies such as solar panels and electric cars.

I even bought the book. As with the series, it does not have a good list of where to get the items that are shown.  It is just being aware that such products exist that makes the series useful. However, I wonder how antagonistic the couple (Ed and Rachelle Begley) really is and what is put on for our entertainment.

I intend to purchase the second season also.

As a conservative that practices green living, I take offense to this biased statement.  I think both sides of the political sprectrum will really enjoy this and benefit from the green living that Ed demonstrates.
