6658335,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"The elevator pitch for this series must have been ""Parks and Recreation"" meets ""CSI,"" without the gore. Or, for that matter, much of the crime-solving.

6658352,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"Always pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy this show. I am not normally a big fan of comedy sitcoms in recent years. I find too much of an emphasize on relationships and constant cultural references. This show is more clever than you would expect, the characters are good, and they have good comedic chemistry. A show is always better when it seems like the actors get along and play off of eachother and that is definitely true of Brooklyn Nine-Nine.",1453075200,,456,4.6419753086419755

6658357,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"Funniest show currently on TV, in my opinion. The DVD set is lacking in features. Includes less than two minutes of Deleted Scenes (a little over a minute of deleted scenes on disc 1, 20 seconds on disc 2, 15 seconds on disc 3). THAT'S IT! The show is so funny that I still give the product five stars, but some audio commentary or blooper reels from the cast would've been appreciated.",1451260800,,386,4.375

6658381,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"This has become my wife and I's favorite comedy!  We discovered Season 1 cheap at a retailer and watched it during downtime of our vacation.  My wife absolutely loved it (so did I) and Season 2 came out on DVD the week after her birthday, so it became a late birthday gift.  We inhaled it before season 3 came out on cable :)  Similar to The Office or Parks and Recreation, with a zany cast in a Brooklyn PD precinct.  Most of the officers are excellent at what they do, but are pretty messed up in other ways.  Always light and fun, even when dealing with dark matters, it is irreverent comedy gold.",1445990400,,600,4.265486725663717

6658426,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"I was worried the show would lose steam after Season 1. I'm happy to say it hasn't, not one bit. Yes, Andy Samberg is playing himself in this show, just in detective's clothing, but it's not Samberg himself that makes the show great, it's how Samberg interacts with the other characters. And it is great; I don't think I've laughed this hard to a sitcom in a long time, and I can't think of a single episode in two seasons that I didn't find enjoyable.

The real star is Andre Braugher, who plays the Captain, and like Samberg's character (Piralta), would not be funny were it not for his interactions with the others.

I've never been crazy about Samberg's SNL skits, but this show has me as an avid fan. Best of all? NO LAUGH TRACK!! Trust me, you'll like it.",1435276800,2,761,4.390070921985815

6658431,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"This show was really funny in season 1. This show is extremely funny in season 2. Andy Samberg is a genius at using goofy characters that actually are intelligent and forth coming. I laughed so many times my jaw and chest hurt. Unlike other sitcoms, I can watch these episodes again and still laugh.

6658437,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"This show is one which I found myself keeping from watching simply due to the fact that I expected it to be terrible.  Even knowing that Terry Crews was in the cast, and  that everyone who watched it claimed it was brilliant, I simply could not bring myself to watch it...
Until I (obviously) did.
And then I watched every single episode I could get my hands on.  Like The Office and Parks and Rec, this show brings dry humor in spades, but still somehow manages to kick it up a notch in ways Emeril could only dream of.
Andy Samberg, whom I've always found amusing, but feared would have difficulty helming his own sitcom, somehow manages to find the perfect medium between absolute insanity and calm/collectiveness, making the characters around him that much more wacky, which is really where this show shines.
Now if only we could get that Scully and Hitchcock team-up episode that everyone is obviously praying for...",1427155200,,921,4.708074534161491

6658443,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"Brooklyn Nine Nine is a must watch for those who want to laugh out loud, and don't we all sometimes? Jake's antics will make you laugh, and Gina is going to be the character you love to hate.

The relationship dynamics are complex yet simple, and the show is well executed. Something actually happens in every episode; this show doesn't get caught up in fillers.

A quick synopsis of the series is this - Jake Peralta and a supporting cast of wacky characters work in a Brooklyn police precinct. They're always getting into trouble of some sort, with Jake often starting - and fixing - the issue. There's your standard sexual tension amongst characters, plus the guy who wants to be Jake's best friend, the droll captain, the musclehead, the tough girl, the suck up and the random guys who just seem to eat and screw things up. Everyone ends up in wacky scenarios and while they aren't particularly unique, they are clever and will make you laugh.

This is a great show, on par with The Office or 30 Parks and Recreation levels of comedy.",1425600000,,1038,4.56989247311828

6658481,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"You wouldn't think it was very funny if you watched the ads on television, but I love this snow. There isn't a single character on the show that I dislike, which is HUGE. How many TV shows can do that and stay interesting? Everyone on the show has such great chemistry. With Adam Samberg, I expected some over-the-top comedy which I don't always enjoy- not everyone can be Will Ferrell. Luckily, Andy Samberg manages to strike the right balance and the comedic timing of the actors on the show is great. What makes me continue to watch the show is that there is an actual storyline in each episode. It's not like a Family Guy, where it's a bunch of jokes smushed together. Season 1 was hiliarious, I'm really glad to see season 2 hasn't dropped the ball and continues to maintain a high standard.",1416441600,6,796,4.496551724137931

6658501,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"Season 2 picks up right where the laughs of season 1 left off! This was one of the best new shows on TV in quite some time last year. There was a worry that the writers wouldn't have enough materials to keep is fresh in season 2. But they pulled it off!

There hasn't been a cop show this funny since Barney Miller. The show doesn't try to be a detective show where you wonder 'whodunit'. It focuses on it's strength, which is the hilarious interactions between the members of the 99th precinct.

Andy Samberg is definitely over the top. He's a caricature of a goofy cop, but it's done in a hilarious way. The entire precinct is made of of caricatures. It just works.

Terry Crewes is absolutely hysterical in his role as a sergeant in the precinct. There might not be any actor in Hollywood more perfect to play the role of a giant muscle man who's actually very sensitive.

Andre Braugher plays perhaps the toughest role of them all. His character never smiles. Never frowns. Never shows any emotion at all. He has a unflinching face at all times. This sounds easy to play as an actor, but it's actually one of the more difficult kinds of roles to play. Braugher nails it and gives a great backboard for the rest of the cast to react to in comedic ways.

Every character is great and every actor who plays them is great in their role.",1412553600,18,1336,4.370967741935484

8678578,5,B00NJ4QG4I,"OK. I love. love, love this show. But here's my problem. Why, whenever Jake has to dress nice, whether it's a suit or tux, does he always look great? When he & Terry go to the ""defense attorney ball"" or whatever the hell it is, he seems to be wearing a tailored tux. He just happened to have that? A shlub like him?
