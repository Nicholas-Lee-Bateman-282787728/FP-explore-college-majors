8521060,5,B007QFS34W,"I have the whole set.  When i was a pre-schooler - i remember watching this strictly for the laughs (especially Ringo's antics)

Now - i bought them for all the great songs they perform.

These dvds had to be sent to Canada - I was completely surprised when they arrived so quickly.",1408579200,,282,4.384615384615385
8521061,3,B007QFS34W,"I had such wonderful memories of this cartoon series as a kid but again when you are seven or eight you aren't the sharpest tool in the shed. As a kid I always thought the Beatles were the actual voices used in the series but they are voices by one or two voice over actors who kind of fade in and out of character. As a fan of old radio shows it is funny how I recognized these actors voices.

Now with that out of the way these are still fun because they feature the real songs fromthe greatest rock band in the world the Beatles so they are worth the investment. I am sure my grand son will enjoy hanging out with grandpa watching these ( But I do have the fear he will think thi sis like Lawrence Welk was to me at my Grandmothers)

Enjoy them for what they are. Cartoons with somegreat music.",1394064000,,797,4.070063694267516

8521063,5,B007QFS34W,I was very pleased to see that these cartoons that I had watched as a youngster was available to purchase. They are very enjoyable to watch and sing along with. If you're a Beatle fan of any degree you need to add these to your collection.,1359504000,,239,4.217391304347826
8521064,1,B007QFS34W,The video & sound of these Beatles Cartoon DVDs are so bad it looks like they were video-taped off the TV with a poor quality machine.  It makes it hard to enjoy watching them.,1348099200,3,176,4.176470588235294
8521065,5,B007QFS34W,"Well I'm back to review The Beatles Vol. 4 Cartoon Show. I am sure glad I purchase my copies of all four volumes of this great blast from the past. I still see no flaws and Dr. Mag from Acmes is still doing a great job in restoring these cartoons. I see that Ringo still up to his tricks when it come to the sing-a-longs, and his funny props he come up with is a laugh! We see that The Fab Four are in a different cartoon form which I think is fantastic. I am looking forward and the BIG SURPISE in the last issues to these great cartoons series, I like to leave you with a question if Dr. Mag can do a great job restoring these cartoons I wonder what he can do with The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour Dvd seeming that Apple is lazy to do a great restored copy for us Beatles Fans!! P.S. I think amazon is going to have available The Beatles Yellow Submarine in a restore Blue Ray And Dvd format coming in May so be on the look out to get a copy.",1335571200,2,944,3.9476439790575917
