4188777,5,B003SPDS8A,"In April 2009, a few of Japan's popular talents in the anime and manga industry teamed up on a project known as ""Higashi no Eden"" (Eden of the East).

Featuring anime production from Production I.G., ""Eden of the East"" would feature the work of series creator Kenji Kamiyama (creator of ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" and worked on ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Hakkenden"" and ""Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade""), manga artist/writer Chica Umino (""Honey and Clover""), art director Yusuke Takeda (""Mobile Suit Gundam Wing"", ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"") and legendary anime musician Kenji Kawai (""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Patlabor"", ""Ranma 1/2', ""Vampire Princess Miyu"").

The anime series debuted on Fuji TV in April 2009 and was followed by three films and now the complete series has been released on Blu-ray (and three films will follow) courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

VIDEO :

""Eden of the East"" is just fantastic to look at.  Presented in 1080p, the artistic backgrounds are magnificent.  I don't think there was one re-used (aside from Takizawa's home) but there was always a new painted scene whenever a character was shown.  If there is one thing that I've noticed with recent Production I.G. anime TV series, despite it being a TV series, they still go out of there way to make the series look phenomenal.  Each painted scene looks fantastic, the character designs by Chica Umino come alive!

The animation and overall colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and I saw no excessive haloing, edge enhancements and saw no artifacting.  This is one beautiful anime series and definitely one of the best, if not the best, looking anime series on Blu-ray thus far.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Eden of the East - The Complete Series"" is presented in English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The audio for this series is fantastic.  From the crowd ambience and just the sounds of leaves, police sirens, blasts, airplanes, computer keyboard clicking, you name it, the audio was well utilized through the surround channels.

Dialogue and Kenji Kawai's impressive musical score is crisp and clear through the front and center channels.  Both Japanese and English vocal tracks were well-done!  Although not an all-out action-driven anime series, there is quite a bit of action throughout the eleven episodes and the lossless audio was very good!

I have to admit that I was surprised to hear Oasis' ""Falling Down"" theme but I've noticed that the theme is only present in the first episode and fans have told me that it ran throughout the whole series.  I'm guessing the rights to license the song for Blu-ray and DVD release was expensive.  But at least the song is presented in the first episode.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Eden of the East - The Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:

  * Director Kamiyama & Original Character Designer Chica Umino Interview - (21:49) A wonderful interview on how the collaboration between Kenji Kamiyama (series creator/director) and ""Honey and Clover"" mangaka Chica Umino came about.  A very cool interview but as always, Umino-san continues to be a mystery as she uses her trademark bear (featured in her HandC manga to cover her face).
  * Kimura (Takizawa) and Hayami (Saki) Interview - (18:32) Interviews with voice actor Ryohei Kimura (voice of Takizawa) and Saori Hayami (voice of Saki).  The two talk about not knowing what kind of series they were doing a voices for but while recording, being impressed with what they saw and being happy to be part of the series.
  * Directors Kamiyama & Oshii Interview - (27:17) Director Kenji Kamiyama and Mamoru Oshii sit down to discuss the production of ""Eden of the East"".
  * Art Director Takeda Interview - (15:36) Art director Yusuke Takeda talks about working with Umino's characters and the things he discussed with director Kamiyama before taking on the series.  Also, showcasing the Bamboo studio as they worked on the backgrounds and Yusuke explains several scenes and what challenges he had and what he wanted to achieve.
  * Composer Kawai Interview - (10:41) Interview with Kenji Kawai who talks about the music of the series and what he has planned.  Also, showing us a few of the tracks he created at the studio.
  * TV Spot - (:32) The commercial for the Japanese Blu-ray and DVD release.
  * Promotion Video - (1:51) The Japanese promotional video for ""Eden of the East"".
  * Textless Closing Song -
  * Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailers

JUDGMENT CALL:

Production I.G. has delivered one of the finest anime television anime series to be released on Blu-ray in America.  With the release of ""Ghost Hound"" from Sentai Filmworks last month which I gave a highly favorable review for it, I thought the Production I.G. series was just phenomenal.  But here they are once again with another series and not only does it come with wonderful animation and many brilliantly painted backgrounds (which is rare to see on a anime TV series), the series creator manages to wrap the main storyline in 11 episodes.

Most anime TV series tend to run 22-26 episodes and yet, Kenji Kamiyama and Production I.G. manage to do it with 11 episodes and what a wonderful series ""Eden of the East"" has turned out to be!

The series has turn out to be one surprise after the other.  From hearing the Oasis theme song, to seeing a well-crafted anime series from director/writer/creator Kenji Kamiyama, seeing the character designs from Chika Umino (which I'm a big fan of the ""Honey and Clover"" manga series), hearing the awesome jazzy music from Kenji Kawai, to see the talented BAMBOO team behind the painted backgrounds of this series....everything about this series is magnificent.  Animation, background design, storyline, music...

And then not only do you have a series which looks awesome on Blu-ray, the lossless audio is great and you get a good number of lengthy special features.  This has got to be my favorite anime series on Blu-ray for 2010, hands down!

I can go on and on about why I love this series but I will just say that when it comes to anime TV series on Blu-ray, I don't expect much because these anime studios are handling other series at the same time and frankly, many are completed within hours of airing on Japanese television.  Anime TV series are usually not detailed like a film or OVA but somehow in 2010, Production I.G. have two anime series on Blu-ray in the U.S. that just breaks traditional convention of anime TV series and how they can look and literally raises the bar of animation and artistic backgrounds.  ""Ghost Hound"" was incredible and the Blu-ray for the series was awesome... but FUNimation Entertainment has done well by releasing this Blu-ray, to include several lengthy special features (and not just the standard opening and ending themes) and is now planning to release the three ""Eden of the East"" films on Blu-ray as well.

And as far as raising the bar for how anime TV series should look, the fact that they got Chica Umino and Ryohei Kimura involved was awesome but just looking at the anime series, rarely do you see the backgrounds being used more than once.  It's like every scene features new animation and background art and there was special emphasis on lighting and once again, this is not the kind of detail you usually see in a anime TV series.  But Production I.G. must have high standards because so far, I've been impressed with their work and it just gets better and better.

It may be a little early since the year is not over but in terms of anime releases on Blu-ray in America, ""Eden of the East - The Complete Series"" may be my pick for ""Anime Series on Blu-ray of the Year (2010)"".

Highly recommended!",1287619200,34,7773,4.863117870722434
4188778,3,B003SPDS8A,"I was really looking forward to Eden of the East.  It was my favorite show of the season, and I was overjoyed when Funimation announced they had licensed the series for release in America.  What's more, they issued a press release saying they had secured the rights to the OP song ""Falling Down"" by Oasis, and I was over the moon with excitement.  Well...I just got Eden of the East and everything was great...until the second episode.  The opening song by Oasis has been replaced by another, much more downbeat song.  In fact, it's used for the rest of the episodes.  I went back and re-read the press release to see if I had misunderstood.  It read:
""The North American anime distributor Funimation has announced that the DVD release of the Eden of the East  television anime series will retain the original opening song from the original Japanese run. The DVD release will also contain the opening theme song from the International version.""
Nowhere is it said that they only obtained the rights to use the song once, nor did it mention that the OP would be replaced by ""the International version"" for the rest of the series.  This was announced later, in an interview detailing the entire process, but by then it was too late for those of us who pre-ordered the release based on the initial press release.
I realize how expensive it was for them to get the rights to the original opening, and commend them for their efforts.  So please allow this review to serve as a caveat:  If you love the opening as much as I, it is only present in the first episode.  The show still holds up as one of the most original viewing experiences I've had in a long time.  Without the opening, it feels somehow incomplete, and I wish I had known this before I purchased the title.",1287446400,5,1766,4.533123028391167
4188779,5,B003SPDS8A,"Takizawa Akira, early 20s, stands in front of the White House, gun in hand, stark naked and a mysterious phone with the word Selecao imprinted on it.  Memory gone, Akira regains his consciousness after, seemingly, erasing his own memories just a few seconds back.  Why is he there?  What reason would he have to brandish a gun in front of such a place?  Why's his memory gone?

What's happening?

With all these important questions that should take precedent over anything else, his strange predicament takes a bow so that he can rescue a girl in front of him with a predicament of her own.  That girl, Saki Morimi, for entirely different reasons, stands in front of the White House and creates a situation, drawing the attention of the police.

And with a simple step forward Akira goes to aid Saki, and a special relationship develops that gives meaning to this whole series.  This bond between them is what drives us, the viewer, to keep watching amidst all the mystery that revolves Akira's past, and his connection to the Selecao, the ""selector.""

But, what's happening?

As it turns out, Akira has been chosen as part of a group of people selected to ""save"" the country of Japan.  What he needs to save them from is not clear, but at his disposal is a mysterious phone and a bank account worth 10 billion Yen.  He can do anything necessary by calling Juiz, the operator, who can accomplish any request he desires.  And by anything, they mean anything.  Want to clear a path through traffic?  Done.  Want to have the Prime Minister of Japan say ""uncle"" on national TV? Done.  Want to murder someone?...yes, even that.  No problem.  But, there's a catch.  Each request is a transaction that dwindles the 10 billion yen down to zero.  Once that zero is reached a special Selecao, the Supporter, comes knocking at your door to snuff you out.  And it's game over, lights out--adios.

You lose.

The grand picture is revealed little by little, and in the end, it's a good story to follow.  I won't divulge more of my opinion on the ending, but just know it's worth it.  What really keeps you there is how the relationship between Akira and Saki develops.  Akira has a charm, an easy spirit that isn't suited for the task given to him by the Selecao.  Yet, in the state that he's in, he charges forward, uncovering the threads tangled within his past.  Saki, also is in a tiffy of her own as she feels lost in the world, trying to find a place where she can start her life.  With Akira beside her, and his problems, she becomes a sort of caretaker to him, something that she feels good about and finds meaning in.  Slowly but surely, both become each other's confidant, in a situation where things aren't clear and danger lurks in every corner, they can only trust themselves.

Intriguing stuff, eh?

Away from the story, everything else is good.  The show is a thing of beauty.  The art style is top notch, with clean lines, bright colors and fluid animation.  The soundtrack stands out and really fits the mood of the show, and the voice acting is great (I saw this with the Japanese voice track, so I can't comment on the quality of the English track).  And with a serious undertone as this, the show does deliver moments of levity and comic relief which never feel out of place.  It's a good mix of drama and comedy, which if it didn't exist, the show would be too overbearing--kudos to the writers for that blend.

So is this a show for you?  I think everyone has a space for this type of anime, and truth be told, we need this kind of anime to do well.  Shows like Monster, Moribito, Fighting Spirit, Rainbow and Eden of the East are rare gems that you need to uncover amongst all the teen angst that populate most of anime shelves these days.  Anyone with a nose for mystery and suspense would do themselves a favor by picking this one up.

Must buy.

Just as an update, there are three other works out there past this DVD release.  One is a movie that compiles the series into a two hour film, compressing what occurs during the series.  The other two are feature length films that continue where the series left off.",1283212800,124,4124,4.503373819163293

4188795,3,B003SPDS8A,"When Eden of the East came out in 2009, it was almost universally regarded as the best anime of the year.  I think this can be attributed to a couple things, one being that it was a weak year for the medium, but also because it was different from your standard anime series.  Production values were high, the story was relatively grounded with its atmosphere while still featuring action and drama, it had a little comedy, a little romance, and it was all done in a relatively tasteful manner.  While the story takes place in Japan, and even attempts to tackle the social issues in Japan, the show is very... American.

As such, as an American, I have trouble getting attached.

Eden of the East is perfectly competent throughout its 11 episodes, but never features any really powerful moments, clever twists, original ideas, or memorable characters.  You'll enjoy it while it lasts, and it doesn't do anything particularly wrong, it just doesn't excel.

Eden of the East, to spare you an overly long and unnecessary explanation, is basically the Bourne Identity meets Future Diary.  It's not the most unorthodox of combinations, and it's executed exactly as you think it would be.  Akira, the main character, has amnesia, and a cellphone.  Other people also have cellphones.  These phones give them access to resources they must use to try to save Japan, and things get ugly and competitive ala Future Diary.  Akira is likable enough, a bit quirky, but never manages to fully forge a clear identity for himself.  The supporting players suffer from this in greater amounts, with not a single one feeling like the viewer has encountered a new, unique individual.

The plot, while making a point of letting the viewer know it's a social commentary piece, doesn't make any real effort to say anything that hasn't been said before.  Far less preachy shows have tackled Japan's social issues in a more interesting way with greater results (see Welcome to the NHK).

The ending... is lazy.  It made sense, I suppose, but ultimately feels anti-climactic and doesn't accomplish much.  The sequel films, unfortunately, while wrapping things up with a tidier bow, essentially play out like Hollywood movie cliches and make matters worse.

That being said, Eden of the East is a perfectly decent way to kill half a day.  The art is good, the animation is slick, Akira is fun to watch, if not a character who will go down in history as a classic character, there are funny moments, cute moments.  Go in with reasonable expectations and you'll enjoy yourself.  Go in expecting a classic, and you'll probably be disappointed.

Eden of the East show rating: 6/10 (amicable)",1448409600,3,2658,4.870824053452115

The characters, especially Takizawa, are very unique and very believable on their own and are so well developed as well as captivating that each could have an anime based on them. But Takizawa does take the cake as one of the most charismatic characters I have ever seen. His upbeat-no-matter-what attitude is so contagious that it makes you wanna be like him. Sure the story can get very complicated but, the sense of adventure, mystery and friendship is unlike any other, not to mention the amazing artwork, soundtrack ( I still listen to it to this day) and script. But its also very dear to me because I ended up visiting the places from the anime with a friend in real life such as Takizawas mall house and actually watching the second movie of the series Lost Paradise in his theater!",1438732800,,856,4.601307189542483

4188884,5,B003SPDS8A,"We have an amnesiac would-be savior and his charming-if-slightly-naive sidekick, a phone with a magnificently effective concierge and 10 billion yen (roughly $98.5 million), the world's most intrusive social network, and 20,000 naked NEETS.  How can this series possibly go wrong?  And it's all set against a very real cultural anxiety over Japan's economic situation in the first decade of the new millennium.

Eden of the East, first broadcast in 2009, is one of those rare works of art that succeeds in capturing the spirit of a time and place and commenting on it without singling out any particular group for ridicule.  Pick any character in the series and you can easily criticize some aspect of that character as a person, but you can also, just as easily, identify positive and redeeming aspects of that character.

All the more impressive is how genuinely likable the cast is.  I'll admit:  when I first started watching Eden, I thought I was going to hate Takizawa the moment he stepped  into frame, impossibly upbeat despite being naked and waving a gun over his head in front of two police officers in the capitol of the United States.  Clearly, there's something wrong with this dude, he's overmedicated or he's one of those new-age hippies who love everybody and everything, and I'm not going to watch past the first episode because he is going to drive me up the wall.  But almost as soon as he started speaking with Saki, he won me over.  It's tempting to say he's charismatic, but I'm not sure that's an accurate statement.  He's calm, he's collected, he's soft-spoken, and he's nice.  He's a gentleman in the truest of the world: he wants those around him to be comfortable and feel safe.  Early on, when he's first getting to know Saki, he asks her about herself and won't accept long silence or empty answers.  He keeps prompting for more substance.  He genuinely wants to know who she is.  Later on, it's revealed that he willingly accepted blame for a series of missile attacks, when the truth is that his actions ensured no one would be hurt in those missile attacks.  And what's more, he doesn't ever ask for applause.  He's not trying to be a national hero.  He simply does what he can to mitigate bad situations.

Likewise, Saki, who starts off as a silly, naive student, very quickly wins us over as we come to understand that she is not really naive but more a victim of a society that doesn't seem to have a place for young people and doesn't seem to really care all that much that it doesn't have a place for them.  Early on, Saki goes to a job interview, and the man interviewing her asks a question, but before she can even begin to respond, he dismisses her answer:  ""No, that's disappointing.  That's not at all what we're looking for.  We want people who think outside the box.  Let's go have lunch.""  Saki goes to the cafeteria, thinking she might have a chance while they eat to redeem herself, but after an hour, a man is sent to quote-unquote accidentally dump noodles all over Saki's skirt.  It's a humiliating moment for her and it's heartbreaking for the audience because she didn't deserve that.  No deserves to be treated like that.  What did Saki do?  She went in for a job interview, got nervous, and gave a fraction of an answer that her interviewer didn't like.  It's bad enough that she was so rudely dismissed, but then to have food dumped on her!  As if to say, you're garbage, go away.  And what does Saki do as a result?  She goes to work on a social network project with her university friends.

And it's here that Eden's political dimension really shines.  Throughout the series, we hear about the 20,000 NEETS, 20,000 young men not in education, employment, or training, and there is a glib dismissal of these young men as basically bums, as lazy bums.  But Saki's job interview, which at first seems a bit out of place in the series, is an opportunity to implicitly question the view of NEETS as bums.  How many of them are NEETS because they're just lazy, and how many of them are NEETS because they were treated like Saki and gave up in frustration?

No answer is ever given, but an answer isn't really important.  What's important is that the question is asked in the first place.  And the series does not stop there.  It goes on to ask an even bigger question:  What would ""fix"" Japan?  What would return Japan to a position of greatness?  Is the answer removing all the deadbeats who aren't working?  Or should the country live in constant of terrorism?  That one should definitely connect with American audiences.

From a technical perspective, the show impresses on almost every front, from character design and background art to the voice acting and the editing.  Of particular note has to be the pacing.  I recently watched Eden again and at the end of every single episode, I was startled by how quickly the episode was over.  This is a series that moves along at a decent clip continuously.  Even when the story seems to slow down for exposition, the pacing never feels like it slows.  As a result, I was able to plow through all eleven episodes in a single night without feeling like I needed a break.

There are only two specific aspects of Eden that I take issue with, and neither is all that significant, but both stand out because everything else is so impressive.

The first is the end of episode 7.  Takizawa confronts a woman who is about to maim a wanted rapist with a cigar cutter, and she escapes through what we learn in some kind of elaborate illusion.  It plays out like this:  she appears to sprout wings from her back and then flies away into the night sky from her hotel window.  It's a jarring moment because it does not fit the realism of the rest of the series.  Everything else that happens is plausible, certainly not likely but plausible.  This moment simply does not work in the context of the rest of the series.

My second issue is that the eleventh episode has no closure.  It's a logical place for a break, but there is no wrap-up.  There is a lot more of the story that still needs to be told, and in order to get that remaining, you have to watch the two films that came after the series, The King of Eden and Paradise Lost.  It's not a deal-breaker, but it can be irritating if you don't know about the films.

Overall, I strong recommended Eden of the East.  It's technically impressive, it's narratively satisfying, it's thought-provoking... it's the complete package.

Oh yeah, and there's a cute little dog with wings.  So, yeah.",1405036800,,6532,4.58599827139153

4188913,5,B003SPDS8A,"This series is super good.
The main character is fantastic. He's quirky, he's charming, he's optimistic, and he's an amnesiac that isn't a bore to find out the backstory of. (In fact, that's where a lot of my praise comes from. His backstory is interesting and for the most part the questions raised get answered......tho I haven't seen the movies they may answer the remainder of questions.)

The concept is great. 12 Cell phones with ten billion yen given to 12 selected individuals to save Japan: that's a pretty cool concept.

The animation looks great. A lot of people have issues with the chibis thrown in, but I didn't find them too distracting

The dub VAs do a great job on this series. Jason Liebrecht taking the spotlight as far as I'm concerned.

The series has its share of awesome and touching moments.

Also, where the series itself is concerned: I liked the ending. I thought it was epic, and it builds hype for the movies.

However, there are a few problems I had with it:

The other main character, while not bad by any means, isn't as good as Takizawa. I mean, she isn't just a generic love interest, in fact, she DOES have trust issues with him for legit reasons. But she isn't as fleshed out as Akira. Speaking of which.....

The romance isn't given much depth either. I mean, in the first three episodes it was good. But afterwards, it's just kind of nonexistent: But to be fair, the stuff we do get is really good so it's not too bad.

The rest of the characters range from ""Good"" (but die after an episode of two) to ""Okay"" with a few amusing scenes. (Again, these last two complaints can easily be fixed by the movies. But as the series goes, it's worth noting.)

Also, there are a few...........weird scenes. Ones that are so small you know they aren't going to be expanded upon, but big enough that they do stick out.

Over all, I REALLY liked this series. The positives VASTLY outweigh the negatives towards it. Even if it's just for the character of Akira Takizawa, it's WELL worth a gander.",1394323200,,2020,4.521978021978022

4188935,3,B003SPDS8A,"Don't get me wrong: Eden of the East is good anime. It's from the writer/director of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, so the storyline is intelligent and solid. The characters are charming and don't stink of clich anime archetypes. The concept is interesting and I was driven to see the conclusion. So why couldn't this climb to four or five stars? Let's get to it:

***PROS***

ANIMATION
Smooth, no shortcuts or gimmicks. The backgrounds are a high point and stand out from standard anime. The battle animation and choreography look great, although battles are almost nonexistent.

CHARACTERS
The main character is funny, confident, and completely at home in his confusion. His self-assurance gives the series a lighthearted attitude that helps to keep it entertaining but also causes a problem down the road, which I'll get to. There's a hacker called ""Panties"" who'll come into play in the second half, and he is fantastic. The rest of the players are mildly interesting and not annoying, which seems to be hard to achieve nowadays in anime.

STORY
It's hard to touch on the story without throwing up *SPOILERS* because the whole point of the show is that the main character (Akira) has amnesia--and thus the audience should be amnesiacs, as well. We learn of this world as we go along. Akira wakes up naked outside the Capitol in Washington, DC. He has a gun, a cellphone, and no memory. The token female lead appears, and it's time to figure out what's going on. His cellphone has a ton of yen on it and an operator on call that can make pretty much anything happen. It's intriguing and enjoyable to unravel the facts of this unique world.

***CONS***

PACING
Eden of the East suffers from some pacing issues that begin around episode five. The story slows to service a romance and some curious side characters, and the casual attitude that makes Akira so likable begins to erode the seriousness that the plot is trying to form. The lag isn't terrible, but I felt myself getting bored. Worry set in that this show was going to lose its narrative or that the creators didn't have a conclusion planned at all (which anime is famous for). This story DOES HAVE A CONCLUSION, but it drifts between epic and disappointing--an odd feeling. While I can say I liked the resolution, I also felt the show deserved more.

MUSIC
The soundtrack is light, funky, and has some jazzy vocals. This quirkiness works during cute moments or when Akira is being slick, but during the intense scenes the lightness of the music undermines the gravity of the content. The missile attack finale is ruled by this music, dampening a great scene and making the end of the show feel like every other episode: charming and mildly entertaining.

Don't let my gripes dissuade you from watching this series; it's a good story and worth your time. I just expected more from the team behind this, because I knew they had the potential to create something fantastic. They created an interesting world and characters, and then moved them forward mildly. I will watch the movies and hope that they include the much-needed drama and intensity that the series is missing. Please enjoy, but don't expect action or anything more than what you start with. The story is interesting and well-conceived, but that is all.",1381363200,7,3286,4.793286219081272
4188936,5,B003SPDS8A,"As a fan of few animes (Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell), I was looking around Netflix one day and I saw Eden of the East.

This is by far one of the most incredible unique animes I've ever seen!

I love the characters, and the whole plot. The character designs and animations are absolutely SUPERB!

4188937,4,B003SPDS8A,"Wonderful series only beef is with the movies (they tend to drag on, and really don't add much), and the pacing (should have been around 20-30 episodes). There were some very interesting things that could have happened that just didn't, due to somewhat rushed events, and the series need to develop pointless side characters.

 I think the only thing that keeps this anime above mediocre is its unrealized potential, the mystery, and a satisfying last episode. (Note that i said episode and not ending.)

The movies aren't horrible per se, but i really wouldn't classify them as good either. So yeah i wouldn't recommend buying them, but as for the series go for it.",1377907200,,666,4.824561403508772

Not only one of the best anime shows of all time, but one of the best shows in recent years. It is only 11 episodes, there's no dull moment, and it leaves you wanting more. This show isn't for a casual watch, It gets really deep and you should think about the concepts it talks about.
There were a few parts where I was like ""What the **** just happened?"" but they're few and far between.

If you're not sure if you'd like it, Funimation has the first few episodes on their YouTube Channel.

Format Contents Review:
The Blu ray is amazing, this was made for HD and it shows. The image quality is absolutely brilliant. Its on par with Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as far as image clarity. This hands down the best voice acting ever done. The dub version should be watched first. (I know thats taboo for some people, but its the truth)

This anime should be missed for any reason, this show would get anyone addicted to anime.

After watching this series, it is odd to watch any sci-fi series or film which attempts to depict our future and have it not include social media and communication devices as a major component.

4188976,3,B003SPDS8A,"I decided to buy and look into this anime (and its two feature-length movie continuations) for two reasons: one, the animation looked gorgeous, and two, the plot sounded very intriguing and original. While I can say that it did fulfill both of those expectations, it didn't quite reach the heights it seemed like it could have.

I won't spoil anything here and I won't bother giving a plot synopsis because you can read it on here already; what I will say is that the mysteries are all enticing at first, but like so many mysteries, the answers don't live up to the questions. After learning the truth behind the plot, I was excited for where the show could go with it, but it... didn't, really.

The plot sort of fumbles along without really taking advantage of the tools it's set up, and in the end it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. The two sequel movies are absolutely necessary if you care at all about the story or closure, but even with them you'll probably feel disappointed. This is simply my opinion, however - you may find something here that I didn't.

On the plus side, the characters are pretty great (except for the protagonist during ""King of Eden"", who is very lacking in personality for that movie only for reasons that will be clear if you watch it), and their interactions are very real. The mystery, while it lasts, is intriguing enough to keep you watching to learn more, even if you're ultimately unsatisfied with the denouement. The animation and artwork are beautiful and the music is good enough.

Overall, I think that Eden of the East is worth a watch for those curious, but not worth a purchase unless you just really take to it. It's an entertaining enough ride, but at the end of the day it never reaches the heights or importance of ""Ghost in the Shell"" despite purporting to be similar, and so it's best enjoyed as one would enjoy something like the ""Bourne"" movies - an entertaining but ultimately shallow experience that's fun while it lasts, but leaves little impact.",1350172800,2,2003,4.649717514124294
4188977,4,B003SPDS8A,"Eden of the East is a good anime. It's an original idea and the animation is very good. There are also plenty of interesting characters. My complaint is that it leaves you hangin' big time. I really liked all the characters and situations they found themselves in, but so far it has no clear ending. Perhaps they are not finished. At the time I'm writing this review I have the series and the 2 movies. If you read this and know of any further developments I'd appreciate it very much if you shot me an e-mail.

The story is about a young man named Takizawa. He has had his memory wiped. He later finds out that he has 8 billion yen to use as he sees fit. The catch is that he has to use it to change the world for the better. There are also over a dozen people in the same boat as him. They are caught up in a game. The person that changes the country for the best is the winner, and the losers all die. These people are called Selacao. The Selacao all have a phone that connects them to a system that can grant almost any request no matter how crazy or grandiose, however, a fee for each request is taken from the balance on their phone.

This anime is very original and entertaining. It definitely would deserve 5 stars if they finished it, but they never get around to it. It's a shame b/c I was really enjoying this one.",1350086400,,1325,4.151750972762646

4189000,5,B003SPDS8A,"I peeked through the styles of Kenji Kamiyama on some episodes of his work on GITS: Stand Alone Complex, and watched the production team create a web of cyber-punk diaries and plots, and though at times very convoluted, was a master work of alternate universes and an in-depth look at cyborgs and humanity.  I knew that coming into this series I was hesitant that this might be a repeat of the cycle, but I came away pleasantly surprised as Kamiyama weaves an excellent balance of a bizarre game, dark themes, humor, and a hard look at the current social situation that is in Japan.  In my opinion, what makes this an even more rich series is when someone watches it with knowing that Japan is going through a huge state of change and malaise, while the whole idea of someone coming out of the fray to fulfill their 'noblesse oblige as a savior' is a very thought-provoking theme.

A mysterious man, Mr. Outside, gives several contestants dubbed ""selecao"" a phone in which they have 10 billion to do as they please.  The catch is that they must use these funds to fulfill their noblesse oblige, or their obligation in a high position to be generous, to change the whole of Japan.  Some squander it for selfish gain, some use it for for their own vision of Japan, and in the meanwhile in Episode I we run into our hero, Akira Takizawa.  He is standing in front of the White House, naked with this phone and gun in hand; his memories wiped clean.  He is dubbed Selecao No. 9.  He runs into a shocked Saki Morimi, a recent college graduate on a trip with her friends, whom they develop a quick friendship.  Together, and with other friends, pursue the game's meaning and see that this game has noble intentions but cruel endings: those who use up their funds are eliminated by ""the supporter.""

The plot unfolds on many levels, but the creative energy behind this is that Akira, Saki and friends, as well as the other Selecao, mish and mash to reveal a wider examination of what Japan's state is like today:  a nation in flux where young people, expected to carry the flame forward, live in an era where jobs are not available or are expected to work for meager wages.  Akira comes to represent the NEETs (""Neither employed, educated, or training"") and fights for them, while some other contestants have more sinister notions of creating a Japan that starts from fresh, or some thinking that purging criminals will help heal the wounds.

The series is unique that unlike GITS, it holds weight on both sides to have a dark, complex theme unfold while keeping it humorous and light.  One of dread as characters lash out to try to make their own noblesse oblige while not trying to get killed, one of love between Akira and Saki, who uncover his past and fall in love slowly, and a group of friends who stick with one another to solve the mystery of this game.  The soundtrack is a great foundation to express these themes, with its jazzy and cute overtones and haunting ambiances throughout key parts in the episodes.

One of the most memorable series I have seen in a while, one with profound imagery, and one that will surprise you where it goes.  Don't expect characters to make big decision to change the world: Akira is a troubled soul but knows what he has to do to make Japan right.  Its not always in the evident changes, but always in the undertones.",1341360000,2,3354,4.543189368770764
4189001,5,B003SPDS8A,"At 11 episodes long, East of Eden is quite a short, yet ample series. Though the show is short, it still manages to pack a lot into it. By the end, there are still mysteries left unsolved, but this was on purpose. The studio decided to conclude the story with two additional movies, rather than with another season. This said, there are still several mysteries floating around by the time the credits roll around on episode 11. From the first episode where Takizawa wakes up in front of the White House with a pistol in one hand and a cell phone in the other, with no memory and no clothes, to the more than satisfying finale, this show had me absolutely hooked. There isn't much action, but it is still funny and much more interesting than the average anime.

This comes with two DVD's and two BR's, which is great since you can still watch it if you don't have a BR player on hand - which is still pretty common.
The package itself looks great inside and out, and it holds all four disks in a neat, organized way that makes them all easy to access, unlike many collections / games that have more than two disks.",1340323200,,1113,4.350961538461538

Add in some conspiracy, some rivalry and a dash of style and it should have been a winner. It is interesting but I felt like the plot was rushed. At 11 episodes it seemed to me that they ran out of money to finish it properly and so skipped a couple of episodes so that they could reach the planned ending. So overall I liked its plot and style but would hesitate to recommend it wholeheartedly. I think there's a sequel and I'll probably watch that too. So give this a try but if you're expecting fast paced action then be advised that this isn't the series for you.",1334102400,,676,4.090225563909774

4189006,5,B003SPDS8A,"A young Japanese man finds himself in Washington D.C. with no memory, no clothes, nothing but a gun and a very complicated cell phone.  Nearby is a young female Japanese college student (Saki) on vacation.  The phone puts him in touch with Juiz, who is his concierge in a bizarre game.  He, along with 11 others, has been chosen as a ""Selecao,"" and has been given 10 billion Yen to ""save Japan"" however he sees fit.  The game was created by someone calling himself ""Mr. Outside,"" who will be the judge of who ""wins"" the game.  The winner gets to live, all the losers, and anyone who breaks the game's rules, will be killed.  Juiz leads him to a stash of weapons and fake ID.  He picks a passport for ""Akira Takizawa"" (""Taki"" for short), meets up again with Saki, and they head back to Japan.  The game is afoot!

*The word NEET (No Employment, Education, or Training) is used alot in this series.  For more information on how this word is used in Japan, Wikipedia has a good article on it.

I have a few problems with the series.  The plot, particularly the ending, has some unbelievable points, and Saki is too cute both visually and (in the English dub) vocally.  Plus, the font on the menu is practically illegible.  But I'll leave it at 5 stars because the voice acting is well done, the plot is well-paced, and the animation is excellent.  At the end of the series, the game isn't over yet, and the story continues with ""The King of Eden,"" which I will probably buy.  Eventually.

Funimation has come a long way in terms of quality of their releases.  Eden of the East is a poor series, it's worth one watch through at most.  The story is complete garbage that doesn't go anywhere.  Characters are typical cookie cutter anime personalities.  The series has absolutely no content, builds up to a non-existent climax that left me clueless about the ending.

The animation has solid colors, but lacks everything that makes a well animated series look good and enjoyable watch.

4189008,5,B003SPDS8A,"So the series begins with a naked guy standing in front of the White House with a cell phone and a gun.  He has no memory of how he got there.  Go --->

This is not your usual, action packed anime series.  Along with Code Geass, this was a delightful breath of fresh air into the US anime market.  The series is more cerebral and will appeal to fans of Ghost in the Shell, L.A.I.N., and other intelligent and less action packed shows and series (yeah GITS has action, but also has that futuristic cyber punk element).  I wouldn't sum this up as a cyper punk or sci-fi series.  More of a modern 'advanced science' story.

The entire series revolves around a conspiratorial game played by several individuals.  These individuals are given a finite amount of money and allowed to spend it however they wish.  Though when they run out, they are terminated.  But the winner is apparently the person who puts the money to the best use while not being terminated.  One of the players is actually rumored to be the 'executioner' and carry out the 'judgement'.

An interesting series to be sure.  I also like that in the original Japanese audio, the Americans speak American (the first episode takes place in DC).  I thought that was nice.  The 'nudity' is handled well.  They animated a blotchy, squiggly spot in front of the areas in question in the few scenes.  Though they don't really show anything... there are several suggestive episodes and incidents including a woman who chops of guys 'Johnnies'.

Throughout the series we watch as the female protagonist struggles to help the amnesia afflicted male protagonist.  It is a relationship well portrayed.  Their emotions and interactions are realistic and complex.  We really get a feel for these two and become intertwined in their struggles.  I found that I could really sympathize with both, and that makes for great viewing.

There is a lot to be revealed and most is revealed by the end of the series.  But the series ends with a ton of questions and the two later 'film' releases reveal much of the rest.  The series is great but it is kind of short.

It's well worth the price though.  I would say to snatch up the combo while it is $25 or so.",1325808000,19,2197,4.57840616966581

The story is a very interesting take on the mystery genre of entertainment. So to anyone who likes mystery type series I would highly recommend that you check this series out. Also the english dub was done very well and I prefer it over the japanese audio.,1307404800,,432,4.4125

The series was a little confusing at first I had a hard time following it but gradually it unfolded the story, which is intriguing and keeps you wanting to find out more.  The animation was very clean and crisp and I enjoyed the English dub as much as the original version, I felt that the character's voices were matched very well and the acting was well done(I prefer subtitles usually).

4189024,4,B003SPDS8A,"First of all, the animation in this show is top-notch, I enjoyed it as much as other animes such as Summer Wars and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Really beautiful imagery of recognizable locations in and around Tokyo.

The main character is a guy who finds himself naked with a gun in front of the White House. He meets the girl, and discovers who he is and what his mission is. The plot deals broadly with the socio-economic problems in Japan. If that interests you in the slightest I recommend this anime.

The plot and characters dealt with some interesting ideas, executed well at times. But it just didn't live up to the potential it had to deal with serious themes (such as in Ghost in the Shell). It didn't capitalize on ideas that could have been used to could appeal to more than just established anime fans.

The character learns who he is through 'deus ex machina', with the plot being explained from a new character's speech instead of more organic or subtle development (such as when the girl goes on an interview). Several of his actions are never explained, maybe they are cleared up in later movies. There's little character development, yes it is tough to do in 11 episodes, but the motivation behind many of the characters' actions are never really developed. They are 2D, they do things consistent with their personality but I would have liked to have seen why they acted the way they did. The 'bad guy' especially has motivations never really explained. There is a story-arc or two, almost like filler episodes, before the ending is swiftly dealt with in a couple episodes.

I guess it seems picky to expect more from a 11-episode anime but with such serious interesting subject matter, I wish that more care were given to the characters rather than just the exciting situations they found themselves in. With all that said, each episode was just very enjoyable. I enjoyed this series and look forward to watching the 2 movies, but have just lowered my expectations for them.

From the start I was hooked I watched it all over a week, but if I didn't have a life I would have watched it all within a day.  The reason I say almost perfect is I think they could have taken a few more episodes to flush out some story plot points.  Some charecters seem to be thrown in and not explained at all.  And the way they just threw in the Eden Of The East computer system was a bit strange.  But all in all if you get it going in thinking this isn't an action show you will love it.  But if you go in thinking this is the next Dragonball or Naruto you will be left wanting more.

4189067,5,B003SPDS8A,"If you enjoy cyber punk anime, then you deserve to treat yourself to this amazing masterpiece!  Produced by the same team and writer as Ghost in the Shell SAC, Eden of the East is a riveting story full of lies, deceit, love, hate, life, death, hope and pain.

Just watching the opening scene I was immediately shocked (in a good way).  It opens with a young man holding a gun, standing naked outside the White House (and for squeamish folks, they tastefully white out his nether regions).  He has no memory and holds a phone that has access to a concierge and billions of yen.  Despite his care free attitude, he does have an interest in discovering more about his past and unraveling the mystery of 'the game'.

The Japanese voice acting is perfect.  I mean PERFECT.  Not since Gundam Seed has there been such a perfectly matched ensemble of talented voice actors as this.  I didn't even flip over to the American voice dub to check it out (as there are only a couple of series that I think do justice with the voice overs).

Though the first episode poses many questions and focuses on the chance encounter between the two protagonists; the series really gets going in the second episode.  By the sixth episode I guarantee a riveting experience.

This series charges ahead at full speed, taking you along for an insane, mind bending ride without pausing for breath.  I planned on watching two episodes then turning in; I actually finished the entire series and stayed up half the night to finish it (it's not that long of a series)!  SO if you have an open mind and several hours to set aside, then dive right in.

4189069,4,B003SPDS8A,"This is a natively widescreen and Hi-Def anime, so the quality of this Blu-ray is among the best transfers out there for animated features.

The story is incomplete in this series: There are at least two movies that extend the plot beyond this series.  I wish I had known that prior to this purchase, as now I've signed up for at least two additional purchases.

The English dub is a quality one, and the main characters are thoroughly likable.  The story starts with our hero, awakening from a trance-like state naked in front of The White House with a cell phone and a gun.  From there, we follow him as he tries to piece together his lost memories and make sense of the bizarre circumstance in which he finds himself.

I was amused by the early use of familiar western pop culture references.  There is just enough violence and intrigue to keep you coming back after each episode.  Where other anime series often have throw-away episodes, this series stays on point.  There was only one uniquely Japanese reference that didn't make initial sense to me: NEET.  This is apparently the equivalent of a hermit or socially inept shut-in.  Would have been nice to know that from the beginning.  Aside from that, the series strikes me as culturally relevant for the times we live in, and it will be interesting to see how long we must wait for this show to seem dated.",1298937600,,1364,4.590909090909091

4189073,4,B003SPDS8A,"It takes a while, but when you get beneath the surface of what appears to be a typical anime/manga approaching-the-apocalypse situation, there are some interesting and more modern themes tackled in Eden of the East that have a rather more urgent contemporary feel than the usual preoccupation with post-war trauma and questions of national identity.

What appears initially to be a post-apocalyptic event - the series set soon after Careless Monday, when an unexplained missile strike took out large sections of downtown Tokyo and targeted five other major cities - soon turns out to be only the tip of the iceberg. Finding himself naked in Washington DC, with his memory wiped, Akira Takizawa gradually discovers that he is part of some elaborate and dangerous game, one of twelve ordinary Japanese citizens selected by a mysterious organisation to be a Seleo, armed with a special phone and access to ten billion yen, charged with coming up with a solution to the crisis facing Japan, and given free-rein to interpret this aim and spend the money in whatever way they see fit.

The subject of a selected group of powerful individuals who have the power to either save the world from a looming apocalypse or themselves bring it about is a fairly common anime subject, but Eden of the East is paced rather differently from such series and appears to have other aims than just the usual build-up to an epic grand-scale destruction of the planet. At the heart of the story is the fate of young disenfranchised Japanese people and their struggle against the conservative and traditional ruling establishment that hold them back from realising their true potential in a modern globalised world, represented here not only by Saki and her friends who are developing a revolutionary computer programme, but by the existence and the role of NEETs or Shut-ins, young men who have dropped out of conventional society in favour of a locked-room, computer-oriented existence.

It's a little unsettling and confusing that Eden of the East doesn't follow the usual anime template however, and it isn't until quite late in the series that its purpose becomes clear. Each episode doesn't exactly leave you eager for what happens next and the tone is difficult to judge, with several bizarre episodes being based around a castrating 'johnny-hunter' set to an incongruous soundtrack of poppy Japanese music. It definitely gains momentum however, and it's a series that works best when considered as a whole rather than on individual episodes. Having said that, while technically the whole 11-part series is included here, the resolution is left to be completed by a couple of feature-length episodes. One hopes they will follow soon.",1294012800,2,2715,5.069351230425056

4189115,3,B003SPDS8A,"I watched Eden of the East with little knowledge about it and not reading anything about it. This series is 11 episodes long (+2 movies not included in the set) and as you can imagine, there's very little ground that can be covered in 11 episodes. Most Anime with such a series count usually take basically straight problems and blow them out of proportion to fit the timing. The opposite was true here.  The material could be expanded to cover easily 50 episodes if they really could expand to a series that large. The material and the world from which the story resides is huge with a large palette of detail. The problem is that with only 11 episodes they have to skim by so much so quickly, that they leave large amounts of character and situational development on the floor in order to keep up their overly frantic pace of storytelling. Everyone outside of the main 2 leads feel flat, inauthentic and ultimately uninteresting. I know that with time, I could learn to like them all, but as that isn't the flow of this show, the process of watching it was painful.

The conclusion of the series accomplishes very little in terms of the grand scheme of the story's universe, and it just aggravated me more in the fact that there will probably never be answers to the questions I had thought of throughout the show.

As a technical note, the animation was good, and it never had a feeling of budget with the picture or sound. I watched it with subtitles and Japanese, so I can't speak for the English dubbing job.",1292371200,7,1514,4.518248175182482

4189117,4,B003SPDS8A,"No Spoilers.

Ladies and gentlemen of the Amazon[.]com, I have committed a cardinal sin of TV/movie buying, I bought this blind. That mean I bought this series without knowing anything about it. I knew only about as much as the back of the box says. Something about naked in front of the white house with a gun. But, I was so anxious to get my very first anime on Blu-ray that I decided to buy into the hype and buy End of the East. Yes, I managed to see the hype without learning about the series at the same time.

For starters, let be clear, Eden of the East is not an action heavy show. If you want action, you're barking up the wrong tree, its a mystery/political series, sorta.

After viewing it once, I can say I'm left a little disappointed.

On the positive side, Eden of the East has excellent animation, the hand drawn parts are appealing to the eye and there's some beautifully integrated CG elements. It's easy to tell this is from Production I.G., the animation company behind ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" (A favorite of mine). Plus, the series has superb pacing, steadily we learn pieces of what Takizawa is involved with. It's also a series that you'll want to marathon, watch in 2-3 sittings. And the characters are likable.

On the negative side, there's a few plot holes, dangling plot threads, and questions left unanswered. A few of these problems might be answered after repeated viewing (I have only watched it once, like I said), but they're definitely there. Plus, it seems you must have a knowledge about the problems facing Japan to appreciate the main plot: an aging population, shrinking job market, and rising unemployment, this gets talked about in the series.

Eden of the East ends with a lot of stuff in the air, so that's the root of my disappointment. I immediately checked online, to see if they were planning a second series, but instead they're going to make three movies, all of which have been licensed by FUNimation. Speaking of FUNi, they turn out their usual standard of excellence. Yep, the days of bad dubs are essentially gone.

So, I like it, but I'm disappointed that I have to wait for 3 movies to come out to get the complete story. You can think of it as a positive, it definitely left me wanting more. But, now I wish I knew more stuff going in. I paid $32 for this series, now I wish I'd paid $20-25.

It also has a bunch of Japanese extras, which is rare since FUNimation doesn't usually get those. I haven't watched them, but they must be informative. I can't watch them because the subtitles look so tiny on my TV. Can I say something that has nothing to do with this show? I HATE Blu-ray menus/subtitles. They're impossible to read. They assume that you're watch on a +50"" HDTV, so they make tiny menus that look nice, but they're IMPOSSIBLE to read on a small screen. Whoever keeps Okaying the tiny blu-ray menus, I hope your eyes fall out.

So, a solid 4-Stars, for excellent pacing and superb animation. And now, to wait 3 years for three movies.",1290211200,3,3020,4.516483516483516
4189118,5,B003SPDS8A,I've never heard of this anime - but the previews made it seem like a must have. Purchased it - and I LOVE it. Highly recommend. Not enough action - but I doubt this anime series needs it with everything else it delivers. Can't wait for Funimation to release the two movies to close up the loose ends. BUY!,1289174400,,306,4.203389830508475
4189119,5,B003SPDS8A,"I have watched/own a lot of anime and every once in a while a title comes along and ""sucks me"" in- this is one such title. I won't go into the plot since many of the reviewers have already done so, but I want to state that anime enthusiasts should definitely get this. I picked up Eden of the East on a whim and watched the entire series in one day, it is that good. As far as the change in the opening song from the first episode, it doesn't take away from the anime at all and shouldn't be a consideration in the purchasing of this title.",1288742400,,540,4.0092592592592595
4189120,4,B003SPDS8A,"""Eden of the East"" (a direct translation of Japanese title ""Higashi no Eden"") starts firing mysteries at you from the first frame, and never really stops even after the final episode ends.  I watched this series with my wife in one bold throw:  all eleven episodes back-to-back, and when we finished we both looked at each other and asked ""So what just happened?""

Part spy-thriller, part-social commentary, part-surrealist love story, ""East of Eden"" is not an anime for those who like their story neat and clean.  The animation is flawless, as is the talent involved: writer and director Kenji Kamiyama (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell-SAC/dp/B000HIVQAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell SAC</a>), character designs by Chika Umino (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-and-Clover/dp/B002DY9KSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey and Clover</a>) and animation by Production I.G (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-One/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume One</a>).

Plot-wise, there is a lot packed into those eleven episodes.  21-year old Morimi Saki stands in front of the White House in Washington D.C. and throws something on the lawn. Takizawa Akira, completely naked and memory-less (ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>), appears holding a gun and a cell phone.  Japan suffered a missile attack that left huge wholes in the country but magically managed not to kill anyone, now know as Careless Monday.  Twelve operatives, called selecaos, are involved in a game to save the world. Each is given ten billion yen (roughly 100 million dollars) and access to a ""concierge"" who keeps track of their purchases and can deliver any service required from cleaning up dead bodies to making the Primer Minster say ""Uncle"" on live TV.  A group of college kids,  part of the NEET generation (In Japan NEET are a slacker sub-class. The word stands for No Employment, Education or Training), have developed an application called ""Eden"" which is a visual search engine that does a search via cellphone on anything it sees through the camera.  The smartest guy in the world is a shut-in nicknamed ""Underpants.""  A sexy female serial killer called the ""Johnny Chopper"" uses a killing method I will leave up to your imagination.

Like I said, a lot packed in.

""East of Eden"" was a great show, although I didn't love it as much as some people did.  Definitely not on the same level as Monster. It was disjointed, and a lot of questions that get posed are just never answered.  What did Morimi Saki throw onto the front lawn of the White House?  Who is the mysterious Supporter?  Did that girl really just grow wings and fly away?  Who are the little white monkey people?  Many of these questions are answered in the two theatrical movies that followed the series, but here they are just questions.

There is one gapping plot hole.  In light of films like The Social Network, it is hard to imagine that these kids would invent something as amazing as the Eden software and not become instantly rich.  They said they couldn't figure out how to sell it, which I find hard to believe.  They would be millionaires.

""East of Eden"" was interesting to me because I recently watched another Japanese film, ""Kaiji the Ultimate Gambler,"" that also offers a bizarre answer to the topical social question in Japan.  What do we do with all of these NEETs?  It is a big issue, and when I lived in Japan you could hardly turn on the TV without hearing something about it.  A whole generation of young adults who just don't want to work, study, or do anything.  A sort of country-wide malaise affecting people of a certain age.  Obviously it is time for the entertainment industry to offer their response.

The DVD for ""Eden of the East"" has some extras, although not as many as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B003SPDS8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;release.  There is an interview with the director and the two main voice actors.  There has been some complaints that the Oasis song that was used for the opening credits in Japan only appears on the first episode due to rights issues, but I honestly didn't even notice.  I tend to skip the opening and closing theme songs anyways, so it didn't affect my viewing experience at all.

The subtitle track was fine.  Nothing really stood out and it did a good job.  One noticeable difference between the subtitle and the dub is the nickname of the computer genius who is called ""underpants"" in the subtitle and ""panties"" in the dub.  Technically, ""underpants"" is the correct Japanese equivalent, as ""panties"" implies women's underwear which is not at all the case in the Japanese language track.  But some one obviously thought it was funnier.",1288656000,,5044,5.535248041775457

characters weren't so unrealistic like most anime I've seen.
The graphics were awesome, like the opening and ending were animated differently from most animes.
Overall...flawless from top to bottom.

Glad to have bought it and glad to have seen it.
Highly recommend.",1288396800,,321,5.42
4189122,5,B003SPDS8A,"Eden of the East is by far one of the few great anime I've seen in a long time. It's not perfect, but pretty close.

For one, the story is unique and easy to jump into, along with being relevant (it touches on terrorism and gives a look at how tough it can be growing up on your own nowadays). And who wouldn't want t phone loaded with money and can do pretty much  anything you wanted?!

My only complaint (aside from the opening being changed the second episode in...) are the characters.

Saki is lacking in character, along with the other members of Eden. She's too quiet; most times she speaks it's in a whisper. It's somewhat understandable considering that she's lost in the world but even after she meets Takizawa she's too introverted to care for, and it makes her predictable. But in a way it's fitting that she's so helpless, giving Takizawa a princess to save and protect.

The other members of Eden are just as boring. A bunch of college graduates (a nerdy bunch) whose main draw is how they progress the story along with their knowledge on technology (Eden). The only exceptions are Osugi (sp?) and Panties who show just enough personality and uniqueness to care. The others are catalysts who help develop Takizawa as a character, along with the story.

Each selecao member is unique in their own way. They range from a doctor, whose main focus is his hospital and caring for his patients, to a murderer whose primary concern is eliminating bad ""johnny's"". The creators did a good job distinguishing between the different ""haves"".

Most of the positives have already been said so this may seem overly critical but I honestly love this series from top to bottom. Animation, story, music (school food punishment is now my favorite band)... there's just so much to love about this series. And anyone can take something from it.",1288051200,3,1838,4.671826625386997
