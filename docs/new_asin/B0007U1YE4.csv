8051744,3,B0007U1YE4,"Rare footage of the early masters, worth it. Gen. Choi interview is really hard to follow, they should include subtitles. I liked Gen Choi's morning workout, he was in incledible shape for his age. On the end, Master Park's moves are great, there is a master doing some great Ho Shin Sul too.",1285632000,,292,4.528301886792453
8051745,4,B0007U1YE4,"I thought it was worth the price just to see some old masters work out. The interview was a little hard to follow, but other than that it was fun to watch. I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars.",1269475200,,193,3.85
8051746,3,B0007U1YE4,"This is a really great video for any TKDist's collection. The whole video is about 85 minutes long and it starts off with a very good 55 minute interview with General Choi on a variety of topics, especially on his vision for Taekwondo. He discusses his time in Japan, in the Japanese Army in Pyongyang and in prison in North Korea. He mentions his background in Karate and mentions that his ""study"" of Taek Kyeon only really covered 1 or 2 ""movements"". For those who have an interest in the History of Taekwondo (beyond the ""whitewashed"" histories that so often appear), this is a great resource. Granted, you will have to patiently listen carefully to General Choi to understand exactly what he's saying but it's worth the effort.

It continues with a view of General Choi's home routines, including his stretching and exercises as well as some body hardening techniques he does. It also has a nice ""walk through"" of his trophies and awards.

The final section of the video is composed of a variety of demos, featuring GM Park Jung-soo and others. There is great footage of the Chang Hon Forms, breaking demos, Hapkido-esque self defence and even some techniques done on the knees.

Overall the interview is very fascinating and the extra clips alone are worth the price of the video. Highly recommended for serios students of TKD, and it's a nice companion to ""Early Masters of Taekwondo"" available from the same source.",1171411200,3,1422,4.795918367346939
8051747,2,B0007U1YE4,"I was disappointed with this DVD. It reminded me of a home video. Choppy editing, variable volume. Most of the time was spent on an interview with General Choi Hong Hi, founder of taekwon-do. I had a hard time understanding it without subtitles and the interviewer clearly didn't understand what General Choi was saying, either. It was embarrassing to watch. I enjoyed seeing some of the patterns performed back in the 1960s, but if that's what you're looking for, a better choice would be the 4 disc CD-ROM set Legacy: Taekwon-do Multimedia Encyclopedia. It includes interviews with the General, all 24 patterns, the entire 15 volume Taekwon-do Encyclopedia, and 200 Korean words related to taekwon-do. Highly valuable for any student.

Bottom line is, I was hoping this DVD would make a nice addition to my small collection, but I'm considering donating it to the public library.",1110844800,14,881,5.034246575342466
