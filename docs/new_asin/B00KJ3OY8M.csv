8659524,4,B00KJ3OY8M,"This is as far from Rossini's opera as two works can be.  It is a modest little comic operetta and doesn't try for grandiosity.  The performances and production are apt.  It is very short.  Only the opera omnivore will feel he needs it, but it does have a certain charm and I can imagine playing it at longish intervals.",1443052800,,320,4.372881355932203

8659527,5,B00KJ3OY8M,"Andr Modeste Grtry is another of those composers who were wildly popular in their time but whose work is now considered somewhat unfashionable and unlikely to click with a modern audience. The spoken dialogue, comic diversions and pleasant melodies of the French opra-comique operetta form is far removed the sophistication of Grtry's contemporary Mozart. Written in 1791 (the year Mozart died) for Paris audiences by a composer who came through the French Revolution, the timing of his version of the William Tell story at least gives it some historical interest. It gives much more than that however in this terrific production from Lige, which goes to great lengths to reproduce the authentic nature and the spirit of the work, and manages to do so to great effect.

Running to only 85 minutes in length, Grtry's version of Guillaume Tell is considerably more concise in its treatment of the historical drama than Rossini's final masterpiece, but by and large the main points are the same. The composer even finds plenty of opportunity within this short running time to introduce all those little colourful interludes and songs that seem to have little relevance to the actual drama but are so much a part of the opra-comique style. The comic drama, singing and dancing tends to dominate the earlier part, it has to be said, with the real drama taking place mostly off-stage.  We get reports of Gessler's tax-demands that affect the little Swiss canton, we hear about the blinding of the elder Melktal, and we are told about the new edict to bow before Gessler's authority, but none of it is actually shown.  William Tell's defiance of the ruling isn't shown either, but the challenge to shoot an apple set on the head of his son is there. That bit we most definitely don't miss out on.

Despite the unusual approach to the development of the drama, with many diversions of local colour and humour, Grtry's Guillaume Tell is nonetheless wonderfully constructed, hitting all the necessary dramatic points with plenty of entertainment and colour. It's also performed that way in this charming production of the work by the Opra Royal de Wallonie. There's a lot of comic exaggeration in the long drawn out phrases and curious intonations of the spoken dialogue, which apparently is an historically accurate way of performing an opra-comique.  It takes a little getting used to, but it does add something to what might otherwise sound silly - even if that is just more silliness. Most disconcertingly, it's even used during the grave account of the elder Melktal's blinding, which makes it curiously funny and disturbing at the same time.

Elsewhere there's a similar approach to the staging, which on the one hand looks cheesy with its old-fashioned Swiss country village setting and painted backdrops (including a wheeled on cow that leaves behind a bit of a mess), but it also captures the contradictory nature of this Guillaume Tell (and perhaps Grtry's ambivalent response to the Revolution which did him little favour as a composer and citizen of Paris). It gets across the spirit of the work in a way that feels authentic, or at least appropriate. This tone and its effectiveness is best exemplified in the battle scene which is played out with cardboard cut-out soldiers operated by puppet strings. A little more modern technical wizardry is called for in the critical apple shooting archery scene - a neon-lit arrow flying with slow-motion sureness on the darkened stage towards its goal - but again it all fits marvellously with the tone adopted.

The acting and singing performances are all also very much on the same page. The performances never pretend to be anything other than fully theatrical, but they are taken seriously within this context and never resort to tongue-in-cheek making fun of the work or its stylisations. This has been typical of Opra Royal de Wallonie productions under the direction of Stefano Mazzonis di Pralafera, and once again it proves to be the best possible way of presenting this kind of material. Also typical of the Lige company is the use of a strong regular cast of Belgian singers for such home-grown works.  Accordingly, we have the usual solid performances from Marc Laho as Tell, although his character is somewhat surprisingly not tested with any arias in this work, Anne-Catherine Gillet as his wife (taking most of the main arias and singing them wonderfully), with Lionel Lhote as Gessler and Liesbeth Devos as the Tell's daughter Marie. With this kind of presentation, Grtry's Guillaume Tell becomes more than just a fascinating historical curiosity and comes fully to life once again as a marvellous entertainment.",1403740800,11,4672,5.003861003861004
