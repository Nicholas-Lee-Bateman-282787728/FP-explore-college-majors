8074068,5,B000A3OOQ8,This is one of the craziest and funniest shows ever.  I laugh so hard I go into coughing fits!  So glad it is a long running show unlike so many great Brit Coms that have so few episodes.,1515110400,,187,3.8947368421052633
8074069,4,B000A3OOQ8,"No Closed Captioning or SDH subs, or it would get 5 stars. Everything else is fine with this collection.",1502409600,,104,4.526315789473684
8074070,4,B000A3OOQ8,I love this series - only reason 4 instead of 5 stars is when I try to watch on my PS4 it requires me to change the country from US to Brittain.,1500595200,,144,3.53125
8074071,5,B000A3OOQ8,Chris Barrie at his best. So disfunctional and so like where I work. I personally find series 2 the best and funniest.,1405987200,,118,4.409090909090909
8074072,5,B000A3OOQ8,"As a Corporate/Executive coach, I only wish they would make excerpts of this hilarious sit com available for training purposes.

Gordon Brittas is a well meaning Leisure Center manager with absolutely no people skills. His leadership style is counter productive to all his well meaning intentions.

A great cast, a hilarious show and UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR REGION I DVD PLAYERS!!!",1357948800,4,411,5.3076923076923075
8074073,5,B000A3OOQ8,"The Brittas Empire is one of the funniest ""Britcoms"" ever. Chris Barrie shines in this insanely funny show. Highly recommended.",1316995200,5,127,5.4
8074074,5,B000A3OOQ8,"I have to say Brittas Empire stands out as one of my favorite British comedies. I love Chris Barrie as Gordon Brittas who believes in himself so much and his mission to fix the world in the fitness area.

 The show was always a good entertainment and often overboard. I loved him and Laura Lancing's character. But Gordon has a loving wife played brilliantly by Philippa Heywood in the performance. She knows how Gordon Brittas is and that's why she wants dependable sensible Laura to drive her to the hospital when she gives birth to twins. Well, Gordon insists on driving her to the hospital and unaware that he impregnated his receptionist, Carol, played beautifully by Harriet Thorpe who keeps her kids in the drawers. Carol gave birth to her twins by a veterinarian at the fitness center in Whitbury Leisure Center.

There is a gay couple in the cast of misfit characters. A charming but irritable secretary, Judy, who doesn't listen to her boss anyway. Then there is his right hand man who is always bandaged up. Whitbury Leisure Centre in Whitbury, England has a lot to offer the general public as long as you don't break one of the hundreds of rules. I think this was the best show that never got boring. After all, Gordon has a dream to make the world a better place.",1249171200,11,1276,4.587719298245614
8074075,5,B000A3OOQ8,"One of the best Britcoms many of you probably never heard of.  Chris Barrie, best known from Red Dwarf, heads a wacky British leisure center where anything can happen, and usually does.  Great comedy, with some great characters (pay special attention to the lovely Harriet Thorpe, Judy Flynn, and Jill Greenacre!)  I realize this version was available in the UK, well, we really need a US version too soon!  (I have an R2 player, though, but not everyone does...)",1211328000,19,463,4.822784810126582
