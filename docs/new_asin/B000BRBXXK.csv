3029754,5,B000BRBXXK,"Funny slapstick movie. Cavemen and dinosaurs mixing it up, so is not historically accurate, and is not meant to be.
Does have sexual references, and one 'attempted sex' scene, which is as silly as the rest of the movie, but not for small children to see.
In the movie, they learn to walk upright, discover fire, cooking, music, and so on.
Dinosaurs howling at the moon and crowing at daylight.
Dinosaurs trying to eat people, and succeeding on one attempt.
Marijuana looking plants with big red edible berries that get the job done, both on humans and dinosaurs.
Ringo Starr as scrawny little Atouk of the Misfit Tribe versus Tonda, the huge muscle bound leader of the main tribe.
Shelly Long versus Barbara Bach for the sparring female roles.
Overall a good, fun movie, as long as you worry about the complete impossibility of a lot of it!
Movie has been 'remastered' or some such and is of excellent quality.",1412812800,18,910,4.69375

3029757,4,B000BRBXXK,"I must have seen this movie at least 5 times when I was a kid and still enjoyed watching it recently. Dinosaur action scenes can't compare to the new technology in movies now, but I guess that makes it funny too! Contains famous actors when they were a lot younger. I was surprised how excellent the picture quality was for such an old movie.",1408233600,13,342,4.359375

3029760,5,B000BRBXXK,"I loved Caveman when it first showed in the theater, and the fun is still there on Blu-ray.  It's a timeless comedy classic that even contributed a few familiar phrases to popular American culture, such as ""Nyah ool!"" and ""Lar alunda Lana.""  Although the humor derives from some keen insight into human foibles and social constructs, don't look for great meaning or 21st century hate-mongering here; this is broad comedy that often borders on slapstick.

There's even a bit of behind-the-scenes humor in that two of the are principal stars, Ringo Starr (Lar) and Barbara Bach (Lana), are married in real life.  Not much of a spoiler:  Ringo ends up with Shelly Long (Tala) at the end, after he drops Barbara Bach into a great mound of dino doo-doo.",1515456000,,748,4.767441860465116

3029762,5,B000BRBXXK,Rare use of English but this movie gets its message across. I found it very funny and unique. It won't ever be an A-list film but it is enjoyable and entertaining.,1510704000,,163,4.290322580645161

3029769,5,B000BRBXXK,"One of my favorite comedies. It doesn't have the quality of, say ""One Million Years B.C."" but it is a really fun movie. Sometimes I wonder if this is the way things did happen.",1502928000,,176,4.205882352941177
3029770,5,B000BRBXXK,"This movie has many familiar faces that were just starting out at this time. Because there were not many words in pre-history there are more sight gags than one liners. Intriguingly many wore that ""0ne Million B.C."" fur bikini fashion.

I did not know that Shelley Long ...Tala (Outrageous Fortune) could talk until I saw Cheers. This is an educational movie; you get a glimpse of what life must have been with Macha the Tyrannosaurs Rex. And what happens in a near by ice age. There is a particularly well-done flagellant scene.

The story is as old as time its self. Atouck (Ringo Starr) alluna Lana (Barbara Bach). Lana alluna Tonda (John Matuszak). Tonda is large enough to kick sand in Atouck's face. Atouck was forced from the tribe. He must no travel the land and have many adventures. He meats people and creatures and Tala. You know he must return. Will he find a way to impress the status seeking Lana?

Everyone forgot to mention that there was only a hand full has made up words used in the whole movie. I originally saw this film at the movies and they handed out dictionaries.",1502582400,,1090,4.579487179487179
3029771,4,B000BRBXXK,"Now this is a fun flick. No great laughs but how can you go wrong with not only a young Dennis Quad, but Ringo Starr, Shelley Long and the delectable Barbara Bach (who came Mrs Ringo Starr after this film...!! Lucky Ringo!!)

However it is the dinosaurs that steal the movie. Well animated by an uncredited Jim Danforth, they are an absolute delight.

A very entertaining film, amusing enough and well restored. Recommended.",1502496000,2,424,4.794520547945205

3029777,5,B000BRBXXK,This movie is juvenile fun. Best role for Ringo since he didn't have to say any lines. So corny it's funny. Whenever I see an old man in a Prehistoric film it makes me laugh because of the short life expectancy back then. If you're an old cave man then you just win the genetic lottery. Haha,1495497600,2,291,4.12280701754386
3029778,4,B000BRBXXK,"This really isn't the greatest movie in the world, but there's just something hilarious about watching a stoned tyrannosaurus. EXTREMELY likable characters played by the entire cast (even the late John Matusak) heighten this light lark about the man in a much doofier time",1494892800,2,272,5.204545454545454
3029779,5,B000BRBXXK,"A hilariously fun movie portraying the evolution of the caveman. Ringo is the leader of misfit cavemen, with Dennis Quaide as his best friend and Shelley Long who's in love with Ringo's character. There's the ""normal cavemen"" tribe that they compete with. Think jocks and nerds. Initially there's no dialogue, but the grunts and gestures evolve into their own language....
"" zug - zug ""  Absolutely hilarious in how they live amongst the dinosaurs....look for the com trails in the sky....goof or irony? I could go on, but it's simply a movie you have to see to appreciate. One  thing you'll never get out of your head is the theme music....no words, yet you can't help but smile when you have this earworm 

This isn't a typical movie in any way. The first time I watched it was with my daughter, who was extremely ill at the time. It's 3 AM and we stumbled upon this movie. Both of us were laughing within minutes .... distracting her from the pain. It's true, laughter is the best medicine. To this day, she's an adult now, whenever she's sick, often I'll go visit and we watch this movie. This funny movie helps. Every time we find something new and funny....or maybe we just missed from laughing.",1493424000,,1201,4.598130841121495
3029780,3,B000BRBXXK,Movie is a classic!! Says multi format but just got the Blu-ray Disc. It would have been nice to have a digital copy too... Get me a digital copy and I'll give it 5 stars!,1492905600,,171,3.914285714285714
3029781,4,B000BRBXXK,"If you're the type of person who needs a deep plot, edge of your seat action and suspense, superb acting and multiple levels of symbolism in order to enjoy a movie, don't bother with this one.
  However, if your willing to take at least a temporary vacation from the real world, let's go.  In the family of The Last Starfighter, The Holy Grail, Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein, Caveman is there to give what I call ""that healthy dose of dumb"" without which our brains would stagnate.",1491696000,,485,4.616279069767442

The last time I saw it, is it had aired once in the late 80's. At the time, it was very awesome. As we grow n mature and away from things, it didn't have the same magic. HOWEVER, I found it heart warming; the childish comedy, the sets where they filmed, the simplistic story....sigh, simpler times. I STILL have a man crush with Dennis Quaid's character Lar-couldn't believe it! Barbara Bach's SICK body-hats off to Ringo for snagging that as his future wife!
If you can enjoy campy dialogue, and old school gag cartoons(Droopy, Woody),please pick up this gem. Yeah, not for everyone, but it does take the blues away on rainy days.",1464652800,,705,4.559055118110236

It is similar to a Saturday Night Live skit in a full length movie filled with stars from NFL player John Matuszak to comedy legend Avery Schreiber. That is just getting started, Ringo Star, Barbara Bach, Shelly Long and Dennis Quaid are all great and had a ball making this movie. Personally I would have given anything to be on the sets while this movie was made. I'll bet it was hysterical.

Barbra Bach (Ringo's real life wife ) looks super hot as Ringo's love interest . I own the dvd version of this film and the bluray is a big improvement. Just due a side by side comparison of the opening and you will see deeper blacks,  near 3d looking credits and a lot less grain .I would have loved if they had recorded a commentary track with the cast and director as you can tell they were having a ball filming this.

3029888,4,B000BRBXXK,"I think that I talked my older brother or my dad into taking me to see this slapstick sex comedy in the theaters way back in the day.  I had no idea that it was a sex comedy (in the order of Mel Brooks).  I wanted to see it because it had funny looking dinosaurs.  I enjoyed it back then as a lad and, even then, I found somethings extremely compelling about Barbara Bach's Lana.  Zug Zug indeed.

I still find pleasure watching this as an adult and am surprised at how much of the juvenile and slapstick humor I missed.  There are plenty of funny moments in this movie, from Atouk's (Ringo Starr) amorous intentions toward Lana risking the wrath of the uber-troglodyte Tonda (John Matuszak) to the showdown with Tonda whose strength coupled with a dim wit is his undoing.  Dennis Quaid co-stars as Lar, the first man to walk erect and to help his wandering tribe walk erect by becoming the first chiropractor.  And then there's Shelley Long (best known from the TV sitcom ""Cheers"") as Tala who is smarter than everyone else but they're all too dumb to know it.  She just can't catch a break.

The animation is of the stop-motion variety and is played for laughs.  The dinosaurs mostly look like they were designed by Ralph Bashki and not a one is menacing.  The zany movie is fun for kids (who won't get the adult humor...hopefully) and adults (who might groan at some of the slapstick and junenilia).  It might not be quite true to call this a comedy classic but it stands the tests of time.",1420070400,6,1493,4.424908424908425

Does have sexual references, and one 'attempted sex' scene, which is as silly as the rest of the movie, but not for small children to see.
In the movie, they learn to walk upright, discover fire, cooking, music, and so on.
Dinosaurs howling at the moon and crowing at daylight.
Dinosaurs trying to eat people, and succeeding on one attempt.
Marijuana looking plants with big red edible berries that get the job done, both on humans and dinosaurs.
Ringo Starr as scrawny little Atouk of the Misfit Tribe versus Tonda, the huge muscle bound leader of the main tribe.
Shelly Long versus Barbara Bach for the sparring female roles.
Overall a good, fun movie, as long as you worry about the complete impossibility of a lot of it!

It's a timeless comedy classic that even contributed a few familiar phrases to popular American culture, such as ""Nyah ool!"" and ""Lar alunda Lana.""  Although the humor derives from some keen insight into human foibles and social constructs, don't look for great meaning or 21st century hate-mongering here; this is broad comedy that often borders on slapstick.

There's even a bit of behind-the-scenes humor in that two of the are principal stars, Ringo Starr (Lar) and Barbara Bach (Lana), are married in real life.  Not much of a spoiler:  Ringo ends up with Shelly Long (Tala) at the end, after he drops Barbara Bach into a great mound of dino doo-doo.",1515456000,,748,4.767441860465116

I did not know that Shelley Long ...Tala (Outrageous Fortune) could talk until I saw Cheers. This is an educational movie; you get a glimpse of what life must have been with Macha the Tyrannosaurs Rex. And what happens in a near by ice age. There is a particularly well-done flagellant scene.

The story is as old as time its self. Atouck (Ringo Starr) alluna Lana (Barbara Bach). Lana alluna Tonda (John Matuszak). Tonda is large enough to kick sand in Atouck's face. Atouck was forced from the tribe. He must no travel the land and have many adventures. He meats people and creatures and Tala. You know he must return.

3264385,4,B000BRBXXK,"I think that I talked my older brother or my dad into taking me to see this slapstick sex comedy in the theaters way back in the day.  I had no idea that it was a sex comedy (in the order of Mel Brooks).  I wanted to see it because it had funny looking dinosaurs.  I enjoyed it back then as a lad and, even then, I found somethings extremely compelling about Barbara Bach's Lana.  Zug Zug indeed.

I still find pleasure watching this as an adult and am surprised at how much of the juvenile and slapstick humor I missed.  There are plenty of funny moments in this movie, from Atouk's (Ringo Starr) amorous intentions toward Lana risking the wrath of the uber-troglodyte Tonda (John Matuszak) to the showdown with Tonda whose strength coupled with a dim wit is his undoing.  Dennis Quaid co-stars as Lar, the first man to walk erect and to help his wandering tribe walk erect by becoming the first chiropractor.  And then there's Shelley Long (best known from the TV sitcom ""Cheers"") as Tala who is smarter than everyone else but they're all too dumb to know it.  She just can't catch a break.

The animation is of the stop-motion variety and is played for laughs.  The dinosaurs mostly look like they were designed by Ralph Bashki and not a one is menacing.  The zany movie is fun for kids (who won't get the adult humor...hopefully) and adults (who might groan at some of the slapstick and junenilia).
