But I do have to say some of the settings the tape took place in (classroom / eraser board segments) were just down write crude and boring, now I know I'm paying for information and someone's knowledge but I could have read a book then watch scribbling on an eraser board! Once we depart the classroom the tape picks up somewhat. A lot of the camera work (angles and lighting) are not top notch.... Well I could go on with this but I'll move on to the content of the tapes. As stated it's a basic presentation it covers all the topics it claims. The information is good and worth viewing (if you the money to splurge) but why pay $when you can pay half that for one of his books. The tapes are geared toward the naturalist / animal tracker but all the information carries over to the mantracking arena. It also comes with some supplementary pamphlet / handout to use for reference in conjunction with the tapes. Overall I would pass on it unless you can find it cheaper.",993254400,4,1149,4.476190476190476
7919667,1,B000046V6L,Tracking Mastering the basics  This video starts out with about five minutes of the video jumping. I don`t mean going places but out of track. At first you think boy did I get taken ?Then the flipping gets better but it is still out of focus. If it`s not flipping or  out of focus you can`t hear it. The second tape starts out better but soon the focus gets bad and there is others talking in the background. Don`t think the flipping stops because it won`t for the rest of the tape .All in all it could be a decent lesson on tracking but who needs the aggravation of your eyeballs crossing and flipping for three hours. My advise is to leave this one go by. And  go watch your uncles home movies the quality coun`t be any lower,984355200,4,727,4.215827338129497
