8482262,5,6303195237,"""Le Gendarme De Saint-Tropez,"" as subtitled in English, is a fine display of the comedic style of Louis de Funes.

Like Peter Sellers, Jackie Chan and Jerry Lewis, and even Charlie Chaplin, de Funes' humor is in his missteps just as it is his choreographed moves. They all share a thread of technique that, though their genres are different, are similarly funny.

This farce has de Funes acting as Ludovic Cruchot, a local police officer who receives a promotion.

Cruchot and his daughter move to where the new job is and try to fit in. He tries to achieve great discipline with his new men, and for a while, earns their respect. His daughter, however, wants to impress some of the wealthier neighbors and flirt with their sons, and claims Cruchot has a huge yacht. This lark leads him to mixed up with the high rollers of the town, and also, unknowingly with a few art thieves.

What ensues is tremendous, but hilarious confusion, as Cruchot tries to keep his daughter's ruse while avoiding his boss' catching him, and somehow deal with the art thieves.

Can Cruchot pull all of this off without getting in trouble? It does not seem so, as things go wrong unexpectedly. Cruchot squirms and wriggles, and it works almost 30 years later.

Although it is subtitled from French in English, the humor comes through. Surely the French speakers will find it funnier, but it is still a film worth recommending.
