8216979,4,B000V79RHE,This is the very old version of the colored one I had watched while in the High School during the sixties. Story of Patriotism and the Sacrifices and the price paid by many in the old India during the Occupation. For Jhansi Ki Rani it was DO or Die regardless to put all on the line  to be Free and Liberated. Thus her spirit and legacies live on to inspire Sohram Modi  to create the  momento for her eternal memory and to remind others  the significance of her ultimate sacrifices. in honour of the motherland she had come to love and value so much. It is B/W and the resolution is not at its best. But something is better than nothing. The resolution is not at its peak and neither is the contrast. But the audio is of good quality..,1457481600,,736,4.235714285714286
8216980,1,B000V79RHE,"I must say that I have never felt so disappointed in a DVD as I was in this colossial rip off. Though the packaging was unbelievably attractive and very professional, the mastering of the film was not as one would have thought it would be. (I have seen back alley boot-leg, homemade jobs that looked better than this!)

The only positive thing to be said about the DVD was that it does contain the entire two hours plus film, unlike the edited US release print of 96 minutes. But rather than the technicolour splendor one gets in the shortened Pioneer DVD release of ""The Flame and The Tiger"", this jittery, jumpy, electronic nightmare of a DVD is all in black and white. As if that really matters, since the DVD is all but unwatchable anyway.

This DVD disappears from the AMAZON site from time to time, and for the sake of the DVD-purchasing population that is a very good thing.  But it also creeps back again, and for those tempted to purchase it I extend a very big ""buyer beware!""  Should anyone ever see an available copy of this film, from NUPUR MARKETING INC, please turn and run as fast as you can. Settle for the shorter but vastly superior DVD release of ""The Flame and The Tiger"" from Geneon (Pioneer). The price is right, and the technicolor though not perfect is certainly better than a jumpy, scrambling black and white image with barely legible English subtitles.",1351036800,2,1380,4.574898785425101

Since my purchase only a few short days ago, I see that the DVD is no longer avalable for purchase and is out of print.  For the sake of the DVD-purchasing population, that is a very good thing.
