8085508,4,B000BDCIV0,"If you are looking for an in-depth 'warts and all' account of Cousteau's life and loves this video is not for you.  If like most true admirers of the man you are interested in an introduction to his work and his values  then this is the one for you.  Starting - where all good videos should - at  the beginning this gives a detailed (without becoming dull) account of what  this legendary man was all about.  The cimematography is, by the standards  of the time, breathtaking and will make you want the rest of the collection  immediately - I know I do and as soon as the Visa company let me I'm going  to get them.",963273600,13,615,4.232758620689655
