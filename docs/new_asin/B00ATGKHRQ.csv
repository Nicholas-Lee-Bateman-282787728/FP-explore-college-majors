The focus on mastering the fondu relev is of tremendous help since without correct body placement and the necessary strength, no one can really turn well. I was fascinated watching how Isabella perfected her movements under Finiss scrutinizing eye.

The big bonus for the viewer is to watch Isabellaat the end of the videoperform beautiful combinations on pointe. This is a very special treat for both aspiring dancers as well as ballet teachers. At the end of the DVD, Finis interviews Isabella during which they discuss her most recent roles and he predicts her future success we are witnessing today. Finis undoubtedly has an eye for greatness. This DVD can be enjoyed by students of any agepro or not, teachers or simply ballet loverswho want to understand the craft required. I highly recommend it!
