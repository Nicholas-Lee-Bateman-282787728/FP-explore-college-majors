8166537,3,B000M59VBW,"The photo on the cover is very mis-leading, showing a Laurel & Hardy from the 1940's.  This early silent movie only features Ollie in character as the cowardly lion.  You will not recognize him, and you may be disappointed if you are looking for a Laurel & Hardy comedy.  This is pure OZ fantasy.

Since this DVD is not formatted for U.S. players, most U.S. buyers should pruchase the NTSC DVDs for reagion 1:
