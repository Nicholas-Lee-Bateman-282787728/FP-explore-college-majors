3619340,1,B001GS7AZS,"This is proof of H. L.  Menken's saying, "" Nobody ever went broke by underestimating the taste of the public "" .  Everything about this movie is a cliche, or improbable or just plain stupid .  Tom Cruise plays an unlovable punk,  a role we've all seen too many times before ;  the low-class, maybe Italian, posturing tough kid ( Fonzie with a pool cue ) .  Not just any pool cue, for that matter, but a Balabushka that Paul Newman's character casually  gives him .  The first thing Cruise does is use the priceless  Balabushka as a break stick to start a game of 9-Ball .  Maybe the film was so low-budget that they couldn't afford a $15 house cue for Cruise to break with .
  The character, "" Fast Eddie Felson ( Newman ) "" of the old movie, "" The Hustler "" has made big money as a wholesale liquor salesman,  thereby contributing even less to society than he did as a pool hustler .  He drops everything to take Cruise's character, "" Vincent "" on the road  to hustle and they end up in a big pool tournament .  The third wheel on this trip is  Vincent's hatable  ex-burglar girlfriend who utters classy lines like, "" You're gonna be humpin' your fist for a month if...""  Her personality is not enough to stop  "" Fast Eddie "" from apparently trying to bed her ,  which never comes to pass .  We get a look at her in a bra and panties,  more because sex sells in Hollywood than to advance the plot .
  Vincent twirls his priceless cue around like a cheerleader's baton.  He plays professional-quality pool but doesn't understand the rudiments of hustling .  "" Fast Eddie "",  angry that Vincent wants to let an ill player escape with his money,  sets him up to be physically beaten severely .  The stupidity of actions like this is lost on the three Knucklehead characters .
  The idea that Fast Eddie could give up pool for years and simply take it up again and play top pool is laughable .
  The ham acting, abhorrent characters, formula plot and terrible audio ( loud background music interspersed with whispered lines ) cannot be rescued by the cameo appearances of real pool pros Grady Matthews,  Steve Mizerak and Keith McCready (  who should have been given the part of "" Vincent "" .
  If you don't play pool, you won't relate to the events in this movie.  If you play pool a lot, you'll agree it stinks .",1511481600,,2311,4.3107476635514015

For me it was no where close to as good as The Hustler, however it was a nice chapter to add to the story. Paul Newman does a good job of playing an aged version of the character he played 25 years earlier. A young Tom Cruise does a solid job of showing character growth.

3619348,5,B001GS7AZS,"I think this is an underrated film for all those involved but for me this is a great movie about youth versus experience and the desire no matter how old you are to live beyond the easy and ordinary life. Cruise is perfect as the obnoxious pool prodigy who can win any game with ease but lacks the finesse and strategy to win the long-ball game. Scorsese weighs the other end of the see-saw as the beaten down and aged man who has had the spark of life almost entirely squeezed out of him until he has it rekindled after seeing Cruise's character, Vince, in a small-time pool hall. Together they lift each other up then knock each other down. Scorsese crafts a stylish film with several great performances from the lead actors. Highly recommended.",1501545600,,747,4.54074074074074
3619349,2,B001GS7AZS,"Review of The Color of Money
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Its not necessary, but youll probably want to watch The Hustler before you watch The Color of Money. In 1961, Paul Newman played Fast Eddie, a pool hustler who took on a master player before he was ready. In 1986, he plays Fast Eddie, a pool hustler who teaches and trains a younger version of himself. Basically, in the remake hes Paul Oldman instead of Paul Newman. Oh, and he won a make-up Oscar.

So, if you liked The Hustler and it won't break you up to see Fast Eddie with gray hair, getting made fun of by a cocky, young upstart, youll probably be able to sit through The Color of Money. But the original is so much better; theres tension and drama rather than comic relief jokes. Tom Cruise plays the younger version of Paul Newman, but hes not as likable as his predecessor. And in this version, Paul Newman doesnt even try to act. He walks through it, as if he knows hes going to win an undeserved Oscar and hes ticked off about it. My advice: just watch The Hustler twice instead.",1499644800,,1051,4.303030303030303
3619350,5,B001GS7AZS,"This movie was great.  I saw it years ago when first came out years ago in the theatres. It is a sequel to the classic The Hustler.  I saw the prequel later, and I think The Color Of Money is much better than it's prequel.",1497571200,,222,3.911111111111111

3619356,5,B001GS7AZS,"A adequate ""follow-up"" to the exemplary (on any level) film ""The Hustler"" for several reasons...mostly 'cause Paul Newman is the original ""Fast Eddie""/a cocky young Tom Cruise/Scorsese directing & Clapton's music...it had all the best & ended as it should w/Newman's stating:  ""Fast Eddie is Back""...",1486512000,,300,5.521739130434782

3619372,4,B001GS7AZS,"A good film, though not up to the quality of The Hustler.  It was satisfying to discover what had happened to ""Fast Eddie"" over the ensuing years since his win over ""Minnesota Fats"", at the cost of his never being able to show his face in a pool hall again.  The final scene leaves you imagining that ""Fast Eddie""  will make a successful come back and defeat that rather unlikable character as played by Tom Cruise. Yup, never underestimate a highly talented pool player, not even an old one.  Like the film The Hustler, this was primarily the continuation of the Eddie Felson character ""study"" rather than a movie about shooting pool.",1474416000,,635,4.642857142857143

3619378,4,B001GS7AZS,"Unlike ""The Hustler"", about all this movie shares with Walter Tevis' book of the same name is the title.  It's literally a completely different story than the book, but with a few of the original characters from the first movie (Paul Newman, but there are others in supporting roles).  It's advantage is there are a lot of pro players in the movie with small supporting parts, including dialog.  Watch for Keith McCready as Grady Seasons, Tom Cruise's character's bete noir.  Many other famous players have bit parts.  This movie was responsible for a pool revival when it came out, but Tom Cruise is easy to hate in this movie.",1471478400,,628,4.724770642201835
3619379,5,B001GS7AZS,The legendary Martin Scorsese created a masterpiece of a sequel to The Hustler. Paul Newman returns as Fast Eddie in another one of his best performances that won him an Oscar finally who this time teaches a young Tom Cruise the ins and outs of hustling. The score and classic 80s songs in this movie are perfect. Unfortunately the blu ray's transfer isn't what it should've been. Its not unwatchable in my opinion but it deserved better and is the only way to own it on blu ray right now unfortunately. If you loved The Hustler its vital that you watch The Color of Money right afterwards so make a night out of it. It will be very satisfying.,1471046400,,644,4.420168067226891

The original was a character driven plot rather than what the new version was: with plot driven characters. Sorry, Paul. You're great in it. But this movie was much different than the original. It is fun to see Tom Cruise prance around with a pool cue. But that's not the same as seeing a REAL movie. This movie needed to be two movies. One movie for Paul, one for Tom. It's interesting to watch the two movies, The Hustler, and The Color of Money, side by side. You get a chance to see what the old black and whites have that makes them so precious. They linger on their subject. They give you time to ""live"" in the movie. Montages document shorter periods of time. When they document longer periods of time, they are more meaningful.

set in 1985, Fast eddie Felson is back and teaches upcoming Pool player Vince (Tom cruise)
how to become the best Pool player around etc
Brilliantly Directed by Martin scorsese & brilliant performance by Paul newman and rightly so
Paul newman won an Academy award for best Actor for this film
Tom cruise and Mary mastrontonio & Helen shaver give Great performances aswell

this film Deserves more respect on blu-ray that's for sure
U.S. Distributor Buena vista never did for this classic film
Buena vista has advertised this blu-ray release as 25th Anniversary edition, what an insult
the Blu-ray transfer is terrible and looks similar to a DVD transfer than HD blu-ray transfer.
the Audio quality is no Different, it's advertised as 5.1 master audio soundtrack, that Dead wrong
the Audio is a new Master audio stereo mix that's it.
which does sound better than the Audio mix on the DVD release
as far as picture quality goes it sucks Buena vista made no effort to clean up the picture quality at all

also no new special features have been added
the dvd release was barebones anyway so as a fan i would've thought
this new blu-ray release would have a new making featurette at least
or new retrospective interviews with Martin scorsese, Tom cruise or Helen shaver would've been Great
or a behind the scenes featurette on the making of the film etc

but tragically no
what an insult to advertise this blu-ray as 25th Anniversary edition when it's not.
absolute waste of money, stay with your DVD release
until a better blu-ray release with new special features comes along

As Fast Eddie Felson(Paul Newman), he still believes that ""money won is twice as sweet as money earned."" To prove his point, he forms a profitable yet volatile partnership with Vince (Tom Cruise), a young pool hustler with a sexy, tough-talking girlfriend (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), but when Vince's flashy arrogance leads to more than a few lost matches, all bets are off between Eddie and him.

It's a phenomenal drama with two superstars and the girl that glues them together.

I'd recommend watching The Hustler first.  It's from the 60's and is in black and white, but if those things don't bother you, watch it first.  In that one, Fast Eddie is the hustler and he's bound to beat the best pool player in the world, Minnesota Fats (played spectacularly by Jackie Gleason).

Newman becomes his mentor and introduces him and his girl to the game. They are a great team. I can't stand Cruise in this movie and it's more to do with the way his character is written than his acting. He was cocky, annoying and arrogant. Newman is great as always and certainly gives the best acting job in the movie. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays Cruise's girlfriend and she gives a great performance she is tough,smart and beautiful. I love The Hustler but I think one thing that was good about this movie was it's not depressing. The Hustler was a depressing movie but featured acting legends Jackie Gleeson, George C. Scott and Piper Laurie in top notch performances. Here we are given Eddie mentoring and getting back into the game he loved and had such a passion for.

3619545,3,B001GS7AZS,"Back in 1961, ""The Hustler"" directed by Robert Rossen and a film adaptation of the 1959 novel by Sidney Caroll was released in theaters.

The film would feature Paul Newman (""The Sting"", ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""Road to Perdition"") in the role of a small-time pool hustler named ""Fast Eddie"" Falson who wanted to become the best pool player in the world.

""The Hustler"" was an amazing success, receiving nine Academy Award nominations and winning two.  The film would earn Paul Newman a ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" nomination and is considered a classic.

Over 25-years later, director Martin Scorsese and writer Richard Price would bring back the character of Eddie Falson for the 1986 film ""The Color of Money"".  A film adaptation based on the 1984 novel by Walter Tevis.

VIDEO:

""The Color of Money: 25th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  First the good.  The good news about the film is that the cinematography by Michael Ballhaus (""The Departed"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Gangs of New York"") is fantastic and he captures the essence of competitive pool playing effectively.

With that being said, now the bad.  I don't know what to say about the video quality of this film but to say that this is the first Blu-ray release that I have found myself extremely disappointed about a transfer. Colors are murky, muddy and just doesn't look good at all.

For a 2012 Blu-ray release, there is no reason why a Blu-ray should look like its DVD counterpart.  In fact, the first ten minutes into the film looks so bad.  I have seen many films made decades before this film that look much better on Blu-ray but the colors for ""The Color of Money"" are murky, the film looked aged and there is a lot of noise (not grain).  Not what I expected for a 25th Anniversary Edition release.

While the video does get better as the movies goes on, I'm quite shocked because I was really hoping for an amazing transfer in HD.  But that was not the case...""The Color of Money"" and its overall PQ was disappointing.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Color of Money"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and French 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven but whenever you hear the pool stick hit the ball, there is a good use of LFE.  The crowd ambiance is OK but for the most part, the film is dialogue driven.  Music also plays a big part of the film and having owned the original soundtrack to this film, the music sounds good on Blu-ray but the film is primarily front and center-channel driven.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

There are no special features included on this Blu-ray release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the 25th anniversary Blu-ray release of ""The Color of Money"", I'm not sure what happened to this Blu-ray release but its the first time I watched a film and not only was it a barebones Blu-ray release but it sports possibly the worst video quality I have seen on Blu-ray.

But before I get to that, let's discuss the film.

""The Color of Money"" is a film that I recommend people to watch after they have see ""The Hustler"".  The first film is important to see where Eddie Felson is coming from, his life as a skilled pool player and his passion for making money through bets and why we see this hustler change in ""The Color of Money"".

Paul Newman is wonderful as ""Fast Eddie"" and as much as he enjoys making money, he is also a competitive man.  Sure, he's been out of competitive pool playing for quite some time but when he starts to see his protege start to succeed as a hustler but also a competitive pool player, Eddie's competitive spirit just comes out and quite simply, he wants to beat Vincent in a game!

Tom Cruise was good in playing the young pool hustler Vincent but his role was not as strong  as it was in ""Top Gun"".  If anything, his character is cocky and often annoying.

And as much as I enjoyed Martin Scorsese films, ""The Color of Money"" felt incomplete.  Yes, Paul Newman was fantastic.  The way that Scorsese was able to make pool so entertaining to watch in the film was well-done.  The storyline complimented his character amazingly well, but unlike ""The Hustler"",  I felt ""The Color of Money"" was not as good as its predecessor.

Which leads me to the Blu-ray release.  How disappointed I was to see the film in such bad shape.  I don't think I have ever seen a film look so bad on Blu-ray and this is a rarity for me.  And because the film looked so bad and this Blu-ray was a barebones release, it dampered my enjoyment of the film.

Overall, ""The Color of Money: 25th Anniversary Edition"" features a strong performance by Paul Newman but the film itself paled in comparison to its predecessor, ""The Hustler"".  But the poor quality of this Blu-ray release is surprising and there is no reason why this film should have looked this bad on Blu-ray.  Unless you are a fan of the film or its talent, then I can understand why you want to get this film on Blu-ray.  But if you are concerned about video quality, you may want to pass.",1352332800,,5047,4.549389567147614

Detail is weak, colors are murky, and this looks like it was sourced from an old, worn out print.  I have a hard time thinking that this film couldn't look better, based on the fact that Martin Scorsese directed it, and the director of photography obviously cared about their role...based on the amazing jib/crane shots alone.  I just hope that a better print exists somewhere, and will make it to Blu-Ray someday.

On the bright side, there appears to be little DNR, and the image is free from other signs of age, such as scratches, etc.

For as much as I was impressed by the blu-ray of ""Raising Arizona"" (a film of similar vintage), I am equally dismayed by this transfer.",1339545600,,756,4.522058823529412

intended Bluray will be released.  Everybody knows about the John Carter debacle and how much money Disney probably will lose, but butchering a classic Live
Action film isn't the way to recoup either money or reputation.  Multiple end-users and professional reviewers have been appalled at this attempt and

It would have been interesting to point out the older real pool pros who were briefly in the cast for example and maybe something on the famous pool stick used.

There are absolutely no extras on the disc, aside from ""sneak peeks"" of other movies, which I can never count as an extra. The movie itself is a great film and there's a reason why Newman earned himself an oscar for his role in it. I'm giving this release 2/5 stars predominately because the movie is great and is superbly acted, with an 'okay' transfer at the current price point. Would I have loved to see a better release? Of course. This movie definitely deserves to have a better HD presentation that I would pay for, but in its current iteration it's an 'acceptable' release if you like the movie or have seen The Hustler, where Newman's role as Fast Eddie Felson originated.

3619557,4,B001GS7AZS,"""The Color of Money"" earned Paul Newman an Academy Award for Best Actor, and Tom Cruise plays the role of confident Vincent Lauria. The film follows-on from the 1961 movie ""The Hustler"", which Newman starred in. As Lauria the viewer is able to see a more ruthless, cavalier side of Cruise's acting skills. Reprising as an older Eddie Felson, Newman offers the sensitivity of a wise tutor to Lauria, but he proves to be a high maintenance protg. They go their separate ways, and come up against each other in an organized competition, which makes for some interesting tension. The experience though gives Felson a spark that's been missing in his life, and Lauria's empty philosophy leaves him the poorer. It's an entertaining film with two very different character personalities constantly playing off against each other.

The Color Of Money. What can I say, we all love it, we all need it, we can't survive without it. Money that is. Paul Newman and a very young Tom Cruise make magic on the screen. The only reason why this movie is the 2nd Best all time is because it came after the Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason 1960 film ""Hustler"". That movie is a love story with Pool as a vehicle of Fast Eddie Felson.

Eddie returns as a retired Pool Hustler who finds his new protege Tom Cruise one night by chance. The movie then speeds up showing the pair hitting the road to ""hustle"" on their way to a big tournament in Vegas. Tom Cruise character the young ""Vincent"" who is called a wonderful flake by Eddie in the movie then turns the tides and hustles his mentor during one of the final scenes.

Great acting in this movie and Paul Newman, a quite accomplished player himself does most of his own pool shooting during the movie.

As someone who grew up ""Hustling"" on the streets and pool hauls I can appreciate the fast money that can be made in gambling and ""taking the other guys dough"". This movie touches on that a bit. Pool Hall Junkies also invokes on this but at the end of that movie the main character strives to be a true professional of the game of pool and not just a ""hustler"".

Overall I give this movie 5 stars and if you like pool you will enjoy it. If you like Paul Newman you will enjoy it. And if you like the young Tom Cruise before the jumping on the couch of Oprah then you will like it!",1318377600,,1504,4.172413793103448
3619559,5,B001GS7AZS,"With the two leads, Paul Newman and Tom Cruise, ""The Color of Money"" is one of the better films of the 1980's. Director Martin Scorsese directed this follow-up to the 1961 ""The Hustler"" movie that also starred Newman. Here, Paul resumes his role as a fast-talking pool shark, but this time he has a good-looking and intelligent protege to whom he teaches the ins and outs of how the game is played. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has a supporting role as Cruise's girlfriend, but even more than the portrayals what makes the film is the outstanding script written by Richard Price.

 ""The Color of Money"" won Newman a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar in 1986 with the movie ultimately grossing an impressive $76,000,000 at the box office.

 This film is available as a stand alone DVD, but is also packaged with Tom Cruise's 1988 feature ""Cocktail"" in a two DVD set.",1295740800,,861,4.758389261744966

I didn't like this movie years ago, when it first came out. I only paid attention to the pool playing and the hustle, which I thought were bogus. However, I saw it the other night on cable and realized this is a great movie, a great work of dramatic art. The acting, the directing, the writing, and the story are all excellent. The story is much richer and more complex than I remembered. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is superb. Of course, Paul Newman is great, as always. He's one of our great actors.

3619564,5,B001GS7AZS,"""The Color of Money,"" starring Paul Newman in a reprise of his role as Fast Eddie Felson from 1961's ""The Hustler,"" is about Money, but it is also about Pool. It is about the intersection of Pool and Money, and how Money won is twice as sweet as money earned. Maybe the title refers to the green felt of a billiard table. But most probably, it is just about Money, and how having it, smelling it, spending it, and looking at it are just about the only things that beat playing a top notch game of pool.

Eddie's pool hustling days are over. Now he makes his money by hustling liquor. He makes the rounds of the bars he used to hustle pool in and sells the bar owners cheap whiskey that they can pass off as big brand name call whisky. Just as he is about to close a deal with Janelle (Helen Shaver), he hears Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise) break a rack of Nine Ball like a clap of thunder. He is intrigued, and knowing talent when he sees it, decides to take Vincent on the road, hustling pool across the country and ending up at the big Nine Ball tournament in Atlantic City.

-------------------------------
Vincent Lauria: I think maybe the money's what's throwing you off here today.
=========================================

Vincent Lauria is perhaps a little bit Joel Goodsen from ""Risky Business,"" a bit of Brian Flanagan from ""Cocktail,"" and even a touch of Lestat de Lioncourt. Or maybe he is more werewolf than vampire. In one of the most exciting sequences of ""The Color of Money"" Vincent performs a Nine Ball Beat Down choreographed to Warren Zevon's ""Werewolves of London.""

""I saw a werewolf drinking a pi&ntilde;a colada at Trader Vic's, his hair was perfect!"" Cruise even pats his coif in synch with that line. I guess it is playing on the juke box, though a bit far fetched that it would be on the juke box in the dive pool hall where the scene unfolds. I will allow it, though, because the scene, like the werewolf's hair, is perfect.

The only problem though, as Eddie sees it, and is trying to show Vincent, is that he is missing the point about Pool, and that point is the Money. By showing off like that he is only going to scare off the money players.

--------------------------------------
Fast Eddie Felson: Pool excellence is *not* about excellent pool.
==============================================

It is hard for Vince to lie down, or dump. He is an animal. ""Ah-oooooh!"" When he is really on fire, there is no stopping him. Eddie tries various methods to educate Vincent, to varying degrees of success. There are some rather harsh lessons. In some ways Vincent also teaches Eddie, especially when it comes to the Poule Du Jour, Nine Ball. Eddie can't quite get behind the New Order:

--------------------------------------
Fast Eddie Felson: This ain't pool. This is for bangers. Straight pool is pool. This is like hand-ball, or cribbage, or something. Straight pool, you gotta be a real surgeon to get 'em, you know? It's all finesse. Now, every thing is nine-ball, 'cause it's fast, good for T.V., good for a lot of break shots... Oh, well. What the hell. Checkers sells more than chess.
===============================================

This aspect of ""The Color of Money"" reminds me of The Master of Go, a novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata published in 1951. It is a semi-fictional, semi-factual chronicle of the lengthy 1938 game of Go by Go master Honinbo Shusai, against the up-and-coming player Minoru Kitani (called Otake in the book).

Manifold and multiform are the levels of meaning of The Master of Go, more so than Kawabata's other works. As well as simply describing the game, there are the themes of the struggle between the older player whose powers are fading, and his younger challenger; and also the clash between the differing playing styles and personalities -- much like the clash between Eddie and Vincent. The book reflects the tension between old traditions and new pragmatism.

That theme is prevalent in ""The Color of Money"" as well. Vincent, besides banging away at Nine Ball, is also a video gamer. What's the matter with kids today? Julian (John Turturro), another younger pool player, is crass, crude, and a sniffer of coke. Eddie feels like such indulgences have really had a detrimental effect on Pool as he knew it. Several times Eddie admonishes Julian to wipe the powder from his nose.

""The Color of Money"" is a little bit like ""Cocktail"" with an older mentor, a kind of father substitute, guiding the young acolyte to greater knowledge and understanding. Cruise, growing up without a father, surrounded by sisters and raised by a single mother, would seem to be ever searching for that father he never had. Newman is good in his role, as he proves quite the stern father, meting out harsh lessons, hard knocks, and avoiding any easy sentimentality.

Like the triangle used to rack the balls, another interesting triangle is formed by Eddie, Vincent, and Vince's girlfriend, Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). There is quite an interesting dynamic at play here -- not a love triangle, though Carmen does seem to flirt a bit with Eddie, but it is more of a partnership, with Eddie and Carmen conspiring to prod and steer the thoroughbred race horse, Vincent, on to victory.

-------------------------
Eddie Felson: I'm not your daddy, I'm not your boyfriend, so don't be playing games with me. I'm your partner.
======================================

Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Carmen is tough and smart -- though she doesn't catch on to the game right at first. Keep your eyes on her, though. She is a quick study. She more than holds her own with the two stars.

---------------------------------------
Fast Eddie Felson: Do you smell that?
Vincent Lauria: What, smoke?
Carmen: No, Money...
==============================================

In one scene Carmen and Eddie run a con with Vince that involves Eddie acting as if Carmen is his young mistress while they berate Vincent, in order to get the suckers to bet against him. It works like a charm, except that Vince gets mad and jealous for real. They tell him that they are only acting, it is all a part of the con they are running. Carmen compares it to the way actors in Hollywood kiss and carry on onscreen.

This is yet another way to look at ""The Color of Money."" Pool as a metaphor for the act of Acting. The veteran actor, Paul Newman showing the young hot shot, Tom Cruise, a thing or two. The acting lessons he is giving him parallel the lessons Eddie is giving Vince about Pool. Eddie goes through a lot of grief coming to terms with old age and the fact that he has a hard time competing with the new generation. But stealth and cunning go a long way, and Newman, the actor, kind of steals the show from the brash new man, the upstart Cruise.

Director Martin Scorsese deserves a lot of credit, too, and look for Forest Whitaker as Amos, a hustler who hustles The Hustler -- and there's even a brief cameo by Iggy Pop! Lots of the extras and pool players were actual pool players, so watch out for them and the incredible shots they make. Tom Cruise actually did learn a lot of the tricks of the trade, and makes a lot of the trick shots himself (though a few really tricky ones were farmed out to pros. Martin Scorsese felt like Tom Cruise could have learned them and would have learned them, but it would have taken out a few precious days from the shooting schedule).

Bottom line is ""The Color of Money"" is a gritty drama that racks up five stars just as easy as Vince sinks a 3 ball combination bank shot.

Paul Newman and Tom Cruise are two very good pool players, Tom Cruise being the young jock while Newman being the old experienced hustler. Tom Cruise wants to make a quick buck but doesn't have the tact to go about it. This is where Newman steps in, improvises on Tom Cruise and helps him become rich, if not big. Newman seemed so familiar and I wondered where I've seen this face. I later checked and saw he was one of the more important characters in the 1998 Sam Mendes classic, road to perdition. Great film too. I'd give this film a 9 based on the acting and the story. I loved the music so dearly. After Tom Cruise's Born on 4th of July, this might be his best work. Loved the exuberance. Long live Werewolves of London. I will now go and pick random Paul Newman films to watch and and celebrate the career of a fine actor. Martin Scorsese, I almost forgot to mention him, is my 2nd favourite director. His work, at it's finest, is no lesser than the finest literary fiction you have read till date.",1248912000,,1082,4.3088235294117645

3619567,3,B001GS7AZS,"It starts off rather strong and then sadly drops off into mediocrity, but overall I can't say that it is a waste of time.  It is no where near as deep or poignant as `The Hustler' (and I didn't even find that movie to be as strong as it could have been) but once again Paul Newman proves he can make just about anything watchable.  While I find him to be the finest actor to ever have lent himself to the big screen, even I can admit that this Oscar winning performance was not Oscar worthy, especially when he was up against Bob Hoskins.

With that said, I'll commence with my review of `The Color of Money'.

25 years after `The Hustler' first garnered praise from critics and audiences alike, Martin Scorsese decided that it would be a good idea to give us insight into the life led by Fast Eddie Felson.  No longer the cocky pool shark he once was, Felson is now a successful investor.  He decides, after watching him play, that he wants to invest in young Vincent Lauria, another cocky young pool shark who is everything that Eddie once was.  With the money and the talent, Felson and Lauria make for a promising team, but their personal ideals seem to get in the way of their compatibility.

The issues I have with `The Color of Money' are all over the place.  First of all, it seems to try and build a decent character arc, but fails mainly due to the fact that nothing appears remotely original.  It feels like it's drawing off `The Hustler' so much that it lacks its own soul.  The acting is good here, at times amazing, but never is any of it close to the awards worthy performances they were lauded as.  Mastantonio is actually the standout to me, mostly because she seems to be the freshest character.  Newman is great in all his scenes, but this is one of his weaker moments in my opinion.  I also felt that the way the film almost gave up half way through was ridiculous.  It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do and so it just throws up its hands and walks away.  The ending is laced with a few strong scenes (in particular the whole `I threw the game to make some cash; here is your take' scene) but in the end it winds up being some great scenes strung along by a mediocre ending.

So, I like it, but I don't love it.  I would recommend seeing `The Hustler' first, most definitely.  Both films are less than they could have been, but the first film manages to be more than this one turned out to be.  I will say this about Scorsese's film though, it does fix the issue I had with `The Hustler' in that the pool scenes are riveting.  My primary complaint with the original film was that the extended pool sequences were boring, almost painfully so.  In `The Color of Money' the scenes are given more edge and more tension thus leading to a more engaging time.

So, it managed to fix the originals sole problem, yet added a slew of other issues that weigh it down even more.",1237852800,,2893,4.297047970479705
3619568,5,B001GS7AZS,"Just as a note--my review comes shortly after the death of Paul Newman, and in a sense this is my way to pay tribute to one of the greatest actors of all time.  He will be sorely missed.

Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) was once a great pool shark, but that was 25 years ago.  Now he's selling liquor, ironically in pool halls, until he stumbles onto Vince (Tom Cruise), an arrogant, young pool hustler.  Felson tries to be his mentor, show him the ropes and teach him a thing or two about what it means to be the best.  The desire to play was too much for Felson so he pulls a quick one on Vince, and in a turn of events, competes against him in the nine ball championships.

""The Color of Money"" is a truly enticing picture.  It has a lot going for it...great direction from Scorsese, a magnificent script and brilliant acting.  The legendary Paul Newman was so convincingly smooth and charming with his liquor sales pitches that you'd be convinced to buy his booze.  In fact, his entire performance seemed to have that quality.

Being that this is a Scorsese picture, you know what to expect in that sense.  The cinematography was intriguing and flawless and the entire cast was truly captivating.  It's a must have for your DVD collection.",1222732800,,1243,4.475555555555555
3619569,4,B001GS7AZS,"There's an admirable economy in the set-up.  We see right away that Fast Eddie (Newman, in a reprise of his role from 1961's The Hustler) is still hustling, now off-brand liquor instead of pool, from which he retired long ago.  At the same time we meet his love interest, conveniently doubling as the object of his liquor hustling, trying to break through the sales pitch to reach Eddie.  We soon see cheap liquor has brought him good money, but it isn't made to appear all that glamorous or enriching in other ways.  At the same time we're introduced to Vincent (Cruise) and his girlfriend/manager Carmen (Mastrantonio).  The sound of Vincent's ""sledgehammer break"" (the break being the first shot of the cue ball into the group of nine balls) distracts Eddie from his pitch, and after observing Vincent, Eddie moves in to make a pitch of an entirely different kind.  For a few minutes we're being hustled along with Vincent and Carmen.  Carmen isn't really so dumb, though, and soon we wonder who will end up hustling whom.

With Eddie as manager/teacher, the trio go on the road where Vincent is to learn to hustle as they work their way to a big score at the national pool championships.  Along the way Eddie's own passions, and pride, are rekindled, and he starts to believe he should be pushing the cue stick himself.  The trio splits up, to meet again at the nationals.

Among the virtues of the first part of the film, in addition to the very tight script and editing, is that the three main characters are well balanced, each with an interesting and important kind of power and weakness.  The emphasis is on psychology and character.  As the film enters the final third, there is a shift to the kind of build-up to a show-down that we might have expected from the start.  Mastrantonio's character becomes less important, and what replaces the earlier psychological tensions doesn't pay off as well either in terms of depth or excitement.  To be sure, there is character development at the end, but some of it's pretty barely sketched.  And there's plenty of excitement leading up to the climax, with some impressively edited pool sequences, but the very end is more of a whimper (almost literally, as there's some near-begging) than a bang.

Bottom line: this is an excellent film in most respects, with fine acting from all involved, interesting ideas, intelligent dialogue, exciting sports, and a mixed pay-off.  Well worth seeing and owning.  The currently available DVD is nonanamorphic widescreen, meaning it has its complete original image but will have black bars on the sides on a wide-screened monitor.  The image quality is good; the stereo sound was a bit jarring at first (to me) but quickly became enjoyable in its brightness and fulness.  Good music from Robbie Robertson and others.

Some notes.  A number of reviewers complain of Cruise's acting, and he often divides audiences in that regard.  I think he was a natural for the role, and filled it very well.  (I also thought he had the more difficult role in Rain Man, and was every bit as good as Hoffman, maybe better.)

The film avoids almost completely the truly dark side of gambling/hustling, to the point that Eddie openly hands Vincent an envelope clearly stuffed with money at a key point in a way that would have led to investigations, broken kneecaps or worse in real life.  Vincent's hustle that led up to this didn't make much sense to me, given the other options available, and not letting Eddie in on it made more sense as a way to heighten the drama than as a rational decision.

The film doesn't draw attention to the different moral/sporting issues involved in different kinds of hustles.  Some hustles are used only to build up the bets, but sporting skill is still relied on to get the pay-off.  There seems a big difference between that and actually winning money by throwing a game, especially in a major tournament where others rely on everyone bringing their best.

That Eddie had to repeatedly ask a certain character if he was a hustler rang false to me, as the excellent actor who played the character was making it clear to us he was hustling.  More subtle direction would have helped make the scene more believable.

About the ending, lack of resolution or open-endedness isn't a problem for me, but it just didn't fit the build-up.  Another reel fleshing out the end with material as good as the first part of the film would have made this film great.

I'm among those who would love to see a sequel in Cruise's later years where he passes on the legacy to another hot newcomer.",1198972800,,4584,4.723270440251572

3619572,5,B001GS7AZS,"A sequel of sorts of Newman's 1960 THE HUSTLER, and a great one. Newman, long out of the pool game now, but still unable to forget it, finds Tom Cruise shooting the daylights out of the game one night and talks the brash young kid into going on the road and becoming a hustler, with Newman as his mentor. Then halfway through the picture Newman gets the bug to play again. He and Cruise meet up in Atlantic City in a match and Newman wins, only he learns that Cruise lost on purpose to collect a bigger debt. Although it's just an example of his pupil learning his lessons too well, Newman is crestfallen; but he refuses to share in the money - thus he's purified under fire and comes away clean. It's a bit of a shock to see the movie shift from Cruise to Newman halfway through, but the ending redeems it. Both Cruise and Newman are simply mesmorizing to watch. Everything in the movie seems to work perfectly: the gritty pool-hall settings, the minor characters (especially Forest Whitaker as a hustler) - everything. Definitely worth a watch.",1116028800,,1046,4.510526315789473
3619573,5,B001GS7AZS,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors living today. Films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, and his most recent The Aviator are modern day classics.

The Color Of Money is also on the list of Scorsese's movie portfolio, and it's also one of the best movies made in general. The film stars Paul Newman (The Hustler) and Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire, Rain Man) as hustlers out to make big cash in the pool halls. Newman reprises his role as Fast Eddie Felson, from 1961's film The Hustler, an oldtimer who is looking for new talent to sport around, Tom Cruise plays his target Vincent, a talented pool player and potential hustler. Felson teaches Vincent and his girl sidekick Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) everything there is to know about professional hustling and then out they go across country hustling through every state they pass on their way to the big championship in Atlanta. The highlight of the film is in the tense relationship between the desperate Felson, the crazy jealous Vincent and the manipulative Carmen, and how they manage to work as a team.

3619574,5,B001GS7AZS,"It's one of my favorite movies. While other films get released multiple times with loads of bonus features, this classic keeps getting a plain brown wrapper. I think Scorsese could do a commentary track if only he was more proud of this creation. Cruise is probably too busy and Newman is gone forever. I was excited to see this finally release on Blu-ray but I know to check my resources. In short, I'm not technical. I know some transfers are nice, some are not. I saw the negative reviews and waited until the blu-ray was available from a local library. My verdict after comparing the DVD to the blu-ray: The blu-ray is no more than 20% better. Anything shot indoors looks basically the same. Outdoor shots offer some additional sharpness. This is not an ""astonishing new transfer"" as the packaging says. I tested the following scenes: The first pool hall is shot from outside and it turns out to be a furniture store- on my VHS copy, you can barely read the Old Style Beer sign in the background when the threesome enters and exits the car at street level. On DVD this is clear but the blu-ray it's about 20% better. The sound quality in this movie has always been flawed. Newman's bedroom scene dialogue with Shaver is barely audible. Newman growls and mumbles through parts of this movie when he isn't charismatic. On the blu-ray, the sound is also about 20% better. The scene where Cruise first plays at Chalky's unsupervised, the soundtrack gets loud. This was an important part of my test because it was probably the one of the few times that I considered lowering the volume. Overall, the voices are also about 20% clearer. Not worth owning in my opinion.

Having recently seen the documentary about Roger Ebert, I had not realized that Siskel and Ebert had both given the movie a bad review. They both mentioned the female characters could have been developed more. I don't agree and I think the wish is strange. Mainly though, I learned that Scorcese isn't proud of this movie as he was having personal problems at the time. The slap from Ebert especially fueled Scorcese to produce better quality: later in life he would help produce Ebert's autobiographical documentary!",1102204800,,2184,4.732283464566929
3619575,4,B001GS7AZS,"""The Color of Money"" is the movie for which Paul Newman finally won his Oscar for Best Actor in 1987, having been given an Honorary Award the year before when the Academy noticed it had passed him over for a quarter of a century.  During that time Newman was nominated for ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""The Hustler,"" ""Hud,"" ""Cool Hand Luke,"" ""Rachel, Rachel,"" ""Absence of Malice,"" and ""The Verdict.""  If you go back and look at the other nominees each year you certainly cannot say that he was ever robbed.  His best performance, in ""Cool Hand Luke,"" lost out to Rod Steiger for ""In the Heat of the Night,"" and was also up against Warren Beatty for ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" Dustin Hoffman for ""The Graduate,"" and Spencer Tracy posthumously for ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""  Nor can you say that the Oscar for ""The Color of Money"" was a gift, given Newman was up against Dexter Gordon for ""'Round Midnight,"" William Hurt in ""Children of a Lesser God,"" Bob Hoskins for ""Mona Lisa,"" and James Woods in ""Salvador.""

I take this extended trip down memory lane because when I watched ""The Color of Money"" again I kept thinking more about the actors than the story and performances.  Not only was I aware that this was Newman's Oscar winning-performance but I was also thinking about how this was another one of the films where Tom Cruise played second fiddle to an established actor (i.e., Hoffman in ""Rain Man"") and enhanced his own reputation as an actor as well as a movie star.  Of course, if you want to learn about being both an actor and a mega-movie star, then who better to be your tutor and role model than Paul Newman?

Newman is once again playing Fast Eddie Felson, whom we first met a long time ago in ""The Hustler.""  But automatically labeling ""The Color of Money"" a sequel to the 1961 film is really a mistake.  It might be the same actor playing the same character but he is a different person.  If ""The Hustler"" is before, then ""The Color of Money"" is after, and we missed the entire during part of Eddie's life.  The movie makes much more sense as another one of those where the old pro teaches the young kid how to play the game.  But since this is modern times the kid gets to teach one or two things back at the old guy as well.

Eddie has put the high-stakes pool games behind him and earns his living as a successful liquor salesman.  Then one night he sees Vince (Cruise) playing pool and Eddie is intrigued.  Not only is Vincent good, but he is also a complete ""flake,"" and Eddie sees the opportunity to use this gimmick to make a killing at the pool tables where the big boys play for big money.  Controlling the kid is the problem, so Eddie gets Vincent's girlfriend, Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), to help steer him in the right direction.  Of course this one is going to come down to Eddie and Vincent playing against each other, which is and yet is not what happens.  Unfortunately, this takes away from our pleasure in watching Eddie manipulate Vincent, because now we have to rethink everything that happened in the film.

""The Color of Money"" is also the Martin Scorsese that least seems to me to be a Martin Scorses movie.  But the director certainly knows how to feature his start.  The best moment in the movie comes when Fast Eddie is going to break a rack of balls for the first time in a long, long time.  He bends over the table and sees his own reflection in the eight ball and then Scorsese smashes into a powerful close-up.

Yeah, this is Paul Newman's movie.  When you compare ""The Color of Money"" to ""The Hustler"" you are going to be more aware of Newman's growth as an actor than you are of the changes in the character.  This is a classic acting lesson on how less is more, and I think you can tell from his own growth as an actor that Tom Cruise was either taking notes or has been watching this particular film more often than he has his blockbusters.",1095897600,,3896,4.421568627450981
3619576,4,B001GS7AZS,"This movie appears to be about pool on the surface.  But it's less about pool than it is about what motivates us as people.

Fast Eddie Felson of the classic, ""The Hustler,"" returns to reverse roles in this 80s classic.  Instead of being the young champ, he wants to train the young champ in Tom Cruise.  But eventually, he realizes the hard way he doesn't have the stomach to play stake horse and in his heart he really wants the thrill of competition.

A lot of people will compare this movie to ""The Hustler,"" since it is the sequel.  There is no comparison.  This movie really can't even be compared in pool terms.  The pool shots that they hit in this movie are, for the most part, average to above-average.  This is not the mind blowing pool play from ""The Hustler"" to be sure.

But this movie does have plenty going for it.  For non-pool players, this movie has more character development.  This movie also features some of the greatest cinematography of any film.  And Newman, Cruise, and the supporting cast all put in stellar performances.

In short, this is a great movie that's worth watching just for enjoyment or on a deeper level for those who appreciate fine cinema.  It's not half the movie that ""The Hustler"" is, but it has enough merits to stand on its own.",1092441600,,1276,4.510917030567685

A retirement home in the Bahamas? Growing old gracefully? Knowing when you're beaten? Could be. That was the lesson Eddie was taught in The Hustler, and that is the lesson he teaches Vince.

I am an avid pool player, but you don't have to be one yourself to appreciate this masterpiece, which IMO rivals anything else Scorsese has done in his long distinguished career.  The whole movie exudes style from start to finish, and Paul Newman is quite simply the epitome of cool.  His performance is intense and laid-back at the same time, and he never over-acts (the most widespread chronic disease in Hollywood).  Cruise is great as the young cocky upstart, Mastrantonio does an admirable job as his tough girlfriend, and the movie is sprinkled with a whole host of really great supporting performances, including one by Forrest Whitaker as the hustler who out-hustles the master, and a great (quick) one by Iggy Pop of all people in a barroom scene.  The movie flows and is filled with energy, the cinematography is spectacular (in particular in a scene where the camera follows closely behind the pool balls as they scatter all over the table).  Newman is as classy as he's ever been, and was wholly deserving of the Oscar for this performance.  The plot is riveting, and takes us from ex-legend Fast Eddie Felson's discovery of a new prodigy (Cruise's character Vincent) through Vincent's initiation into the Art of Hustling and a whirlwind tour of east coast bars and poolhalls, all the way through to the stirring conclusion as the Master battles the Student in a winner-take-all final game of 9 ball.  Perhaps my favorite scene is when, in the midst of an ongoing  moral dilemma, Eddie looks down to take his shot and sees his reflection in the 8-ball.  He pauses, then straightens up, unscrews his cue and forfeits the match, unable to face himself.  The movie is funny, highly dramatic and inspiring all at the same time, and Martin Scorsese gives it his usual tough, no-frills, occasionally violent personal stamp to make it one of the most watchable pieces of cinema you will see in a long time.  Maybe I'm biased since I grew up in New Jersey (near NYC), but I don't think so.

Newman is flawless in this film and being a pool player myself, I could relate to his slump that he was going though. I found his preformance brilliant thoughout the film.
Tom Cruise plays the cocky student who plays pool better than his teacher (Newman), while being backed by Newman's cash he must learn that the art of hustlng does not mean you win all the time. Cruise being a cocky and brash kid loves the bragging rights associated with winning so learning to dump is not something he likes doing. Cruise's preformance was great as well. In the begining of the film he makes small change at pool, but by the end he is hustling some of the world's finest players for major cash. His attitude change from start to end is well done.
The movie comes together well and the script is terrific. The DVD version of the film comes together nicely with Digital sound and crisp images. However don't look for much in the way of extras on the DVD.

Early in the movie he notices Vincent (Cruise) beating a local pool hustler at his own game. With this Newman decides to take Vicent and his girl friend out on the professional billiards circuit. Full of many great trick pool shots as well as a lot of colorfull trash-talking hustlers this movie is impressive. Dealing a lot with self-confidence and self-control, The Color of Money really makes your think.",992995200,,527,4.739130434782608
3619586,4,B001GS7AZS,"I love pool.  I love to shoot it, to watch and study it.
I liked this movie, and to be truthful, this movie is what started my interest and desire to play pool.  Of course I've seen The Hustler and it is a far superior movie, it just re-enforced my desire to play even more.
The Color Of Money is 20+yrs on from The Hustler.  Fast Eddie is now a liquor salesman, and even though he's very good at it, the desire to play and return to shooting is still as strong in his blood as it was at end of The Hustler after whipping Minnesota Fats.  Felson comes upon Vincent ( played by a young Tom Cruise ) and decides to take him under his wing to show him the ropes and the ""hustles"" that make the money in the pool halls.
Cruise is actually good as the ""green"" young apprentice and Newman is fabulous as the seasoned Felson.  Newman does bring the same intensity to Fast Eddie which makes the clash of styles between him and Cruise extremely interesting in the first half of the movie.
I don't really care for the way the film pans out, with Newman getting hustled by a great Forrest Whittaker character, and especially the anti-climatic ending.  Scorsese sets the film up for a big show down and ends it with nothing.  What was the problem?  Surely the studio could have afforded another 5 minutes of celluloid to see Fast Eddie beat Cruise... however this movie is enjoyable....but no matter how many times you watch it.... the 9 ball doesn't fall off the break.",992131200,,1458,4.354243542435424
3619587,5,B001GS7AZS,"This is by far my favorite flick.  Not only is the acting and storyline more than great, the focus on the game of pool itself is what draws me to watch this film again and again.  If you are an avid pool player or just enjoy the game I would easily point you towards this movie.  Just remember you really should sit down and watch ""The Hustler"" first.

3619588,4,B001GS7AZS,"Paul Newman reprises his Fast Eddie Felson role from ""The Hustler.""  This time he has a young Tom Cruise (toward the beginning of his career) as a protege.  The relationship between the three main characters (Newman, Cruise, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Cruise's girlfriend) is fascinating--Cruise is an uncomplicated kid who just loves to do what he does well, while Newman and Mastrantonio are both worldy schemers who care for Cruise but are not above using him to attain their own goals.  Some viewers may be disappointed by the ending; however, although the story may seem to end suddenly, the character arcs are complete.",979344000,,633,5.0673076923076925
3619589,4,B001GS7AZS,"What most people probably don't know about this film is that it is actually a sequal to 1961's The Hustler.  This is an important fact about this film.  It makes the movie a much better film than if it just stands alone.  Paul Newman reprises his role of pool shark ""Fast"" Eddie Felson, this time under the direction of Martin Scorsese, some 23 years after making The Hustler.  The audience joins Felson at this point is his life too.  Long gone are his days off pool huslin', now Felson is a traveling liquir salesman with a close relationship with his product.  Then something happens.  One night at the bar/poolhall where he frequents, Felson sees a kid(Tom Cruise) tearing up his opponents on the pool table.  He is very impressed.  He decides to get back in the game, this time as a manager(similar to the cahracter George C. Scott played in The Hustler).  Now all he has to do is convince Cruise and his girlfriend(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) to hit the road with him.  He does, and they set out.  The goal being to make it to Vegas for a big money tournament.  The partnership turns out to be a bust almost from the get go.  Cruise, a brilliant player, can't seem to swallow his pride enough to take the dive essential for hustlin', and Eddie is not quite as good at being a teacher as he was a student.  They split and Eddie decides it is time to start playing again.  In one of the films best moments he gets hustled by a young Forrest Whitaker, while he is trying to hustle Whitaker.  Eventually Eddie makes to Vegas where he has a showdown with Cruise in the semifinals.
The acting, directing, and cinematography in this film easily make up for it's lack of script.  Paul Newman is flawless as Fast Eddie.  He took a Oscar nominated performance, aged him 23 years, and turned it into Oscar gold.  He spins a whole new chapter in the life of a character he had already performed so well. Perhaps this character was not even difficult to play, but he carries the film and is definatly it's biggest attraction.  Cruise is also fun to watch.  An up-and-comer at this point in his career(after Risky Business, before Top Gun) he plays young and dumb with great enthusiasm.  Mastrantonio received and Oscar nomination for her tough girl role.  Scorsese shows us the game of pool as only he could show it to us.  Addtionally unique camera and lighting shots add to the appeal of the film.
Before seeing this film people should see The Hustler.  It is a superior film to The Color of Money.  However after seeing The Hustler audiences will have a whole new appriciation for The Color of Money.  It becomes apparent how special Newman's evolution of Felson is, and that is rare in film.",974332800,,2689,4.534303534303534
3619590,4,B001GS7AZS,"Stellar cast livens up director Martin Scorsese's sequel to The Hustler.  Paul Newman reprises his role as Fast Eddie Felson, a former pool hustler who takes Tom Cruise (in a underrated performance) under his wing, and learns his young protege the mechanics of pool hustling.
A great film by Scorsese that is ofter over looked The Color of Money is really an excellent film, that really diserves credit. Critics and audiences alike found the second half boring while I enjoyed  the entire film.  With an afterthought, I still personally belive that Cruise's caracter would have beaten Fast Eddie at the end of the film, mainly due to the facts, that Cruise never lost a single match in the film.  Unless he threw them, and Paul newman did lose to other Pool Hustler's.  Even after he got his eye glasses, I feel that Cruise's confidence would have still given him the edge.",969494400,,873,4.754966887417218
3619591,4,B001GS7AZS,"Since I am probably the worst pool player in the world it's nice to watch a movie about guys who know how to play. It seems to me that the more movies I watch by Martin Scorsese, the more impressed I am with his  directing. But something interesting happened with this one. For the first  time it wasn't Scorsese's directing that caught my eye. What really made  this movie great is the talented cast. Paul Newman's every move seems to be  perfect. It's one of the few times that I actually agree with the choice  the Oscar's made. He did deserve to win. Tom Cruise was very convincing in  his role as well. And Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio I have to admit  DEFINATELY caught my attention. But that's a another story lol. I know a  lot of people refer this movie as one of Scorsese's lesser films,and many  found the ending to be a dissappointment. But I just don't see it that way.  I enjoyed every second of the film. ANYONE who is a Scorsese fan should of  course watch this,and ANYONE who enjoys great cinema should watch this  movie as well. In a time when movies just seem to be about special effects  and not realy about acting,it's nice to watch a movie that  TRULY has great  acting and is enjoying to watch.",960249600,,1216,4.390134529147982

The story denies everything Eddie learned in the Hustler. Forrest  Whitaker's small role is probably the best thing about this waste of  celluoid, and even that's a painful scene!
