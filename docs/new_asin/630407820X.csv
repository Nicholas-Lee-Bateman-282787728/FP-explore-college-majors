But it's damn good. A stellar performance  by James Black (he with the Perfect etc.) is backed up by some very solid  supporting actors. The script is sharp as a razor... Only the rather  insipid technical direction (pretty forgivable on a movie that must have  been shot for dimes over a few days) lets it down. But as the direction of  the actors is so elegant, you barely notice this after the first few  minutes.
Maybe better as a rental than a purchase unless you're a golf  fiend or a wannabe low-budget filmmaker (in which case you can learn more  about Real Film from this than any slacker ""masterpiece"" such as  ""Clerks"" or the Blair Witch wotsit), it still deserves to have  more of a future than its almost certain destination of Video Hell. As do  the actors and the director.
