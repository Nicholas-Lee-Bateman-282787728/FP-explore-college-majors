211568,5,6300181316,"The life and death of a Chicago gangster in the twenties.  Famous for it's silvery cinematography by Lee Garmes and it's unique stylish touches by director Howard Hawks, SCARFACE is an exceptionally intelligent, sometimes frightening, thrilling and provocative motion picture from the Hollywood of 1932.  Obviously modeled on Al Capone with an incestuous sister thrown in, this is probably the most vivid of all the gangster epics of the 193O's.  It's revelling in its own sins wasn't obscured by its subtitle THE SHAME OF A NATION.  Produced by Howard Hughes and scripted by Ben Hecht (who won an AA) the movie made a star of Polish-born Paul Muni, and as Cesca, Ann Dvorak deservedly won kudos from the critics.  Muni is perfectly cast as Tony Camonte: he moves sluggishly as if only the part of his brain which is evil generates his physical movements.  Karen Morley, an underrated actress is exceptional as Poppy, the ice-cool blonde gun moll.  She's a violence-craving chippie who is turned on by power and killing. The famous scene where slinky, sexy Ann Dvorak seduces George Raft - i.e. asking him whether he likes the steamy jazz music as she shimmies - was based on an actual incident: it plays beautifully.  Legend says that Al Capone himself owned a print of SCARFACE and saw it perhaps a half dozen times: he was mesmorised at its authenticity in that many lines spoken by Muni and others came right out the mouths of real-life gangsters!",1036972800,6,1451,4.846153846153846
211569,5,6300181316,"Crazysexycool is the best way I can describe Paul Muni's character in Scarface. Muni,as always is excellent. He takes a ruthless,coldblooded killer and gives him likeablilty and appeal. Except for the ""moral lecture"" in the middle, the movie is great. That scene was added to satisfy the censors in 1932. Director Howard Hawks said that the scene made him want to puke. If you see the movie, you will see what he means. It only serves to slow down the pace of the movie. Otherwise, I love it. My favorite scene is when Tony first gets a machine gun. He's like a kid with a new toy. He's says ""out of my way while I spit"" and procedes to mow the place down. I also love the scene where Tony and his entourage swagger into the nightclub. He is the epitome of cool. At that moment he is a man on top of the world. At the end when he is reduced to a sniveling coward and is mowed down in the street just as he deserved to be, I still found myself liking the guy!",1035158400,6,958,4.155913978494624
211570,5,6300181316,"This movie was really very good. The acting was pure and realistic. Paul Muni was actually very handsome. Maybe it's because of the bad boy image. His sister on the other hand, resembled Betty Boop. The characters played their parts very well. It was believable and exciting. This gangster movie is a true gangster flick, and is worth seeing.",1028851200,2,342,4.813559322033898
211571,5,6300181316,"Although there were many movies similar to this one made in the 30's and 40's, I feel that this one stands out for it's realism and spark. The rise  and fall of a gangster was never this well done.",967507200,7,197,4.051282051282051
211572,4,6300181316,"A gritty, fast-paced gangster film that ranks among the best. Made with a purpose in 1932, take into consideration for example the complete title; 'Scarface: The Shame Of A Nation' and the beginning credits that ask you  'what are you going to do about it?', very straightforward but navet  aside this is one of the best gangster films of all time. Paul Muni  delivers a powerful performance, he is a driving force throughout the  movie. Muni plays Tony Camonte, a character that is more than 'loosely'  based on Al Capone. He easily dominates every scene he's in except one or  two scenes that get stolen by Ann Dvorak as his sultry little sister.  George Raft is equally impressive as Tony's best friend and partner in  crime. Boris Karloff, fresh from the success of 'Frankenstein' just one  year earlier, also appears as one of Tony's competitors. Ann Dvorak is  excellent as Tony's sultry sister who is also in love (or is it lust?) with  Tony's best friend (Raft). Scandalous at the time particularly because of  the unhealthy relationship between Tony and his sister. Those hints of  incest are still kind of shocking today. Some of the elements were taken  from real life like the 'St. Valentine Day Massacre' for example and the  name 'Scarface' is directed at Al Capone himself. The ending is a knockout.  An intense and brutal gangster drama that's brilliantly directed by Hawks.  A remake was attempted in the 80's with Brian DePalma and Al Pacino in the  role of Tony Montana, but was much more graphic and violent not to mention  overlong. This remains the best of the Scarface films. From a scale of 1-10  I give this film an 8!",965001600,47,1643,4.71830985915493

Tony*excellent PAUL MUNI)..is a  (thinly veiled Capone) complete with facial scar, is given a job as the right arm of a Chicago King Pin, Johnny Lovo. Lovo runs the South Side complete with Gangster Mob Rule. As Tony gets more ambitious he sets his eye for Lovo's gal Poppy. He soon bumps off Lovo and sets up the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. He now drives in bullet proof car and has his own bodyguards. George Raft is a minion of Johnny who marries his sister Cesca and ends up dead. As the police track down Tony in his hide out complete with steel shuttered windows, he finally has the law decide his fate. Muni is excellent as the sometimes charmer and funny Tony.  Cessna (Ann Dvorak) is a scene stealing sister who wants fun and will do anything to get it. Boris Karloff as yet another rival Tony has to deal with.

211655,4,6300181316,"Scarface, 1932 film

This picture is an indictment of gang rule and of the callous indifference of the government to the constantly increasing menace to our safety and liberty. [The election of FDR and a Democratic Congress would be followed by the New Deal and increased Federal police powers that would reduce crime from small gangs of robbers and kidnappers. The repeal of the 18th Amendment put down most of the illegal trade in alcohol.] Every incident in this picture is the reproduction of an actual occurrence .... What are YOU doing about it? Ben Hecht was a Chicago newspaperman who wrote the play The Front Page.

Three men discuss business. Big Louie is on top of the world. A man enters and fires three shots! He wipes the revolver clean and drops it. This will start a gang war over control of the booze business. The police take two men in from a barbershop. Tony Camonte has a long record. But he doesnt say much. A writ of habeas corpus frees Tony and Rinaldo. The police want to get him. Tony visits a friend to hide out at Johnnys place. There is plenty on the South Side. Poppy doesnt like cigar smoke. Tony has plans for the future. Tony disapproves of his sisters boyfriend. Johnny Lovo is the new president of the First Ward Social Club. He will organize business so they will be richer. One man disagrees, he is put in his place. Tony Camonte is a good salesman (they show how he does business). Gunshots tell of their business methods.

Two men bring flowers to a wounded man, then gunshots. Tony has a new car, a steel body and bullet-proof glass. Johnny complains about Tonys sale on the Northside. A dead body carries a message to the gang. Tonys secretary answers the phone (for comic relief). Poppy visits Tony. OHara was killed in his flower shop that morning. Tony buys extra shirts. His bed has inside springs, there is a back door for a getaway. The opposition bought new Tommy guns for their business needs (theres no law against this). OHaras mob drives by to show off their Tommy guns! Tony obtains a free sample. Johnny Lovo objects to this war, but Tony overrules him. There is more shooting. The police cant stop the sale of Tommy guns, they bring them in from another state. The gang war goes on. Seven men get a message on St. Valentines Day.

Gaffney was late, he saw what happened. MacArthur from the Journal visits Gaffney for an interview. The newspapers publicize these gangsters. Does a newspaper publisher do wrong with his newspaper coverage? Only the Federal government can do something about gangs. Can the American Legion do something? Tony attends a play (Rain, about Sadie). He hears that Gaffney is at a bowling alley, his boys go for a visit. Just watch this. Later Tony visits a nightclub. Tonys sister comes on to Rinaldo, but he is afraid. The dance floor is crowded, but Tony sees his sister home. The bullet-proof glass saves Tony from gunfire. He makes a telephone call to check on Rinaldo and ask for help. Then a timed call to Lovo when Tony and Rinaldo are there. Johnny pleads to no avail! Poppy packs her stuff. Tonys sister visits Rinaldo. Tony returns from Florida, there is a new crowd at City Hall. Tony visits Rinaldos flat to say goodbye! The police arrive, shots are fired. The police will raid Tonys place. Can he get away? No, but he has arms and ammunition. Shots are exchanged. A teargas grenade explodes in the room. Tony leaves, the police catch him. But he runs for it. A policeman uses his Tommy gun to stop Tony in the end. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.] The alternate ending is a trial, conviction, and hanging for Tony on 10 Dec 1931.

This 1932 movie asked for new Federal laws to control gangs. Criminals could evade local and state laws by crossing state lines. Congress was reluctant to increase Federal powers at first. They feared a secret police on the European model.",1475107200,,3893,4.555714285714286

Although no music score, the picture seem not preserved well, looks old and the soundtrack is very mono, I don't mind about that. This is The Gangster Film of All time.

""This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our safety and liberty.

Every incident in this picture is the reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government:

`What are you going to do about it?'""

The above is printed on the screen at the beginning of this realistic movie based on Armitage Trail's 1929 novel ""Scarface.""

This movie is loosely based on the life of Al Capone (1899 to 1947) whose nickname was ""Scarface.""  It was filmed during the ""pre-code"" era before censorship (even though there was attempted censorship that delayed this movie's release by almost a year.)

It stars Paul Muni (1895 to 1967) who gives an electrifying performance as well as George Raft (1901 to 1980). (This movie launched Raft's career as a leading man.)  Even horror icon Boris Karloff (1887 to 1969) has a small role.

It was produced by billionaire Howard Hughes Jr. and the legendary Howard Hawks (who also directed).

The first Howard Hughes movie I ever saw was ""Hell's Angels.""  I was surprisingly impressed by this movie and equally impressed by `Scarface.""

Note that a version of the ""St. Valentine's day massacre"" (1929) is also shown in this movie.

Note also that an ""X"" motif is used throughout this film.  It appears many times (but not all) when a death is portrayed.

In 1994, this movie was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

There are no blemishes or other distracted artifacts onscreen.  In fact, this movie probably appears better than when it was first filmed!

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2007) has two extras: an introduction and an alternate ending.

In conclusion, this movie is truly a ground breaking masterpiece that influenced all gangster films to follow!!

He's the textbook definition of ambitious and driven.  This movie depicts his rise through the ranks of organized crime providing nonstop action as well as great acting.

It's the typical story of the rise and fall of a hoodlum from the Italian section of the slums.  Tony's mother and eighteen year old sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak), are caught up in his tumultuous comings and goings, although they don't know what he does to make so much money.  ""Cesca"" wants to have fun dating boys but Tony wants her to stay at home where he can keep an eye on her.  Ann Dvorak is full of life and her little flirts with George Raft (Tony's right hand man) are one of the best parts of the movie in my opinion.
When Tony isn't throwing his weight around with the boys in the gang, he's salivating over his bosses moll, Poppy, played by Karen Morley.  Her performance adds the ""tough broad"" appeal that you would expect from a Tony Camonte.

211765,5,6300181316,"This is a bit unusual but I actually went back and watched this original Howard Hawks directed film after watching the 1983 Brian DePalma remake with Al Pacino.  For one thing the Blu ray limited edition version I have includes a DVD of this brave crime thriller.  A thinly veiled Al Capone, known as Tony Camonte is aggressively portrayed by Paul Muni.  He's a vicious thug with his sights set on the bootlegging empire of his boss Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins).  Lovo controls the mob business on one side of Chicago and Tom Gaffney (Boris Karloff, fresh from his success in ""Frankenstein"") controls the other.  Tony thinks he should control both and soon he will.  Not only that, he manages to inherit Lovo's mistress, Poppy (Karen Morley).

Tony likes to flaunt Poppy but his real female interest is his 18 year old sister, Cesca (Ann Dvorak).  While Tony insists he is only protecting his sister from scum like him, it comes across as a little unnatural.  This relationship is played out equally well in the later remake with Al Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as the siblings.  George Raft who would become one of Hollywood's best gangster characters plays Tony's best friend and ill-fated lover of Cesca.

""Scarface"" was produced by Howard Hughes with a brilliant script by the famed Ben Hecht based on Armitage Trail's novel.  Hughes had to make numerous compromises in order to get the movie past the various censor boards and he wasn't happy about it.  In fact he eventually pulled the film shortly after its release and it didn't see daylight again until 1979.  The film plays well today.  It deals with immigration (Italians), gun control, advanced automatic weapons (Tommy-guns), outgunned police, illegal substances (booze) and is loaded with violence.  Sounds familiar.  This film is a crime classic that stands the test of time.  It is exciting, well-acted and very entertaining.  Better than DePalma's '83 remake?  You bet.",1410134400,,1946,4.96594427244582

The street and car scenes do a good job of showing how things looked back then.  The characters also are probably more realistic depictions of what people were like back then.  It seems that all the gangsters liked to dress in suits to impress.  Their favorite gun was the famous ""Tommy Gun"" and the police had them too.

While the characters are mostly grim, the lead character of Scarface (modeled after Al Capone) has a somewhat comic element.  His male ""secretary"" would be at home in any Three Stooges movie.

211796,4,6300181316,"In 1930 two things happened in Hollywood. Firstly, what was to become the MPAA drew up plans for new censorship of all movies either made or played in the United States. Secondly, Howard Hawks film Scarface was set to be released but encountered significant setback because of the all new production code. A short history of the production code shows that in 1922 several high profile scandals involving Hollywood actors jolted the federal government to call for some sort of code. Increasingly alarming was the fact that talkies, or sound pictures, would bring about even more violence and profanity to the screens (The Production Code of 1930). It took 8 years, but finally the code was settled upon in 1930. Until this time censorship had been enforced by local censorship boards and dos and donts could vary from state to state and even city to city. By the time the code came out, 2 of 3 films which were to make up the gangster trilogy had been released, or cleared for release; they were The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Hawks film varied so greatly from both of these that he went through a two year struggle with the censorship board. Later ,details will be presented to show the specificity of the changes that were to be made to Scarface In order for it to be shown to the public. Scarface was a unique contribution to Hollywood in the manner of directing/style, acting, and thematic elements when compared to other films of the time. This paper is to explore where the differences are made up and how it contributed to the Hollywood of its time.

One of the first noticeable elements of Scarface is the way in which Hawks directed and shot his film. Hawks was already a semi-successful director by the time he came out with Scarface and because of this success he was able to shoot his film in the manner that he chose. The first scene of the film shows a club owner tidying up after a party and going to make a phone call. This is where Hawks influence starts to shine. Our yet to be titled main character, Tony, is seen only by his shadow approaching the club owner. In a long drawn out sequence, Tonys shadow finally closes in on the owner and with 3 shots he is gunned down. The use of mise-en-scene is also heavily influential not only in this scene, but in others throughout the film, which will be discussed further later. This entire scene is dominated by backlighting and heavy shadows. Instead of the typical over the shoulder shot from Tonys point of view to the club owners first person point of view shot, Hawks chooses to conceal Tony and let the opening scene set the mood for the film. Another example of Hawks unique approach to this film comes from the use, or lack there of, of the close up. During early 1930s hollywood closeups were used to say something about a scene or character, much unlike todays filming philosophy. It has been said about Hawks Scarface that:
...Howard Hawks was quite eloquent about (the closeup). There aren't many closeups in his films. A closeup really meant something back then. Yes, it is the most efficient way to shoot a scene sometimes, but its not always the best, in terms of emotion. If you hold your closeups back, and use them sparingly, then they really have some impact (OMalley).

The truest form of the closeup that is seen in the film is towards the very end when Tony carries out the order to execute his then boss Johnny. The camera moves in for an extreme close up of Tony. Now comes the best closeup in Scarface: Tony staring sightlessly at his Boss, his T-Shaped (X) scare played up by superb lighting (Hagemann, 36). The depth of detail in this shot alone symbolizes Tonys struggle throughout the entire film. His character is plagued by people he must get rid of and those that he cant trust. The third significant decision Hawks made when shooting Scarface was the lack of shot, reverse-shot. By this time in Hollywood, studios were cranking out films at an unbelievable rate and had established a certain set of guidelines which guided how quickly a movie could be produced. One of the standards that had been set was the shot, reverse-shot used during dialogue. Hawks chose to ignore convention and instead play with creative angles and wide shots to show characters in conversation which makes his directing stand above the rest of the films during this era.

Another way that Hawks ensured Scarface would be set apart from the rest was in his choice of actors and storytelling. Unlike Little Caesar, which starred Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Glenda Farrell, and Edward G. Robinson, and The Public Enemy that starred James Cagney and Jean Harlow, two megastars of the time, Scarface was plagued with no-name and new actors. The choice of having new actors in Scarface allowed Hawks to manipulate the story by having a cast that didn't already have a defined character such as James Cagney would have. Another problem that Hawks ran into with the production code was how his actors acted in Scarface. In other films of the time the director made it clear that the villain wasn't to be glorified and ...usually (took) great care to describe as psychopathic gangsters: EG and Robinson in Little Caesar (1930) Mervyn LeRoy and James Cagney who crushes half a grapefruit in the face of his companion in the enemy public (1931) (Cine Club Decaen). Hawks, on the other hand, made Tony the hero of the film with no real enmity against him from other gangsters or the police for that matter. For the most part, Tony IS glorified as having the life in Scarface. He gets the girl, he has the car, the money, and the title of king. The other problem with Tonys character is that he is infatuated with his younger sister. The first encounter that is seen between Tony and Cesca (Francesca) is at their mothers small apartment where Tony catches her kissing another man. This scene is broken down into two parts, first jealousy, then protectiveness. Cesca responds unaptly to both of these. Rather than acting like her brother, she is about to describe his unnatural protectiveness and sexual jealousy when she is interrupted: ""You act more like...I don't know. Sometimes I think..."" To give her ""real fun"" and to prohibit her from having ""more fellas,"" he places a wad of bills in her hand ([...]). Tonys character here immediately responds the only way he knows how, by solving the problem with money. Later in the film, one sees the same solution when it comes to his girl, Poppy.

Tonys character and how he is portrayed, both in regards to his sister, and mainly because of the glorification of his character, the villain, among other smaller reasons, are the driving force behind the trouble Hawks and producer Hughes encountered with the production code. For two years, Howard Hughes, the film's producer, battled with the industry's censors, who only allowed the film's release with the deletion of some scripted material ([...]). The results of the code being enforced upon his film were apparent from the very start. The title was changed to Scarface: Shame of a Nation, and a moralizing introduction was added: This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our safety and our liberty. Every incident in this picture is the reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government: 'What are you going to do about it?' The government is your government. What are YOU going to do about it? ([...]). These titles placed at the front end of the film were demoralizing to the script and showed first hand the power of the code. The ending of the film was also modified. The original ending saw Tony and Cesca come to a realization with each other that led to Tony trying to escape from the police. In the altered ending, this dialogue is cut so that Cesca seems to be a passive and ""womanly"" accomplice, rather than as an active accomplice (xroads.virginia.edu). The altered ending coincided with dubbed over dialogue and scenes that were cut from the original. The alternate ending never received Hawks approval and in fact was shot by a different director, Richard Rosson. Hays was the leading man behind the production code and changes to Scarface. Hays and Hawks never reached an agreement on the film and Director Hawks refused to alter Scarface in response to Hays' demands, but producer Howard Hughes eventually defers on certain points. Hughes changes the title to Scarface: The Shame of the Nation, and adds Hays' suggested prologue that describes the film as an ""indictment of gang rule in America."" In addition, an entire scene is inserted to address the Code's concerns, in which citizens confront the newspaper publisher, frustrated by all the publicity gangsters receive in the press ([...]). The alternate ending removed Tonys status as hero and instead ended with him begging for mercy from the police. The police decide not to meet Tonys demands and instead mow him down and win approval through the cheering of a crowd that has gathered near the scene.

Finally Scarface stands apart from other films of the time through the use of motifs in its mise-en-scene. The most famous use of this is suggested in the symbolic use of Xs throughout the film. Some scholars have pointed out that the Xs throughout the film symbolize death, while others agree with ownership by Tony. For sake of continuity and clarification, the stance taken here will be that of the X marking death and not ownership. Hawks was very enthusiastic about using the X in his film. Hawks saw the X as a way to connect unseen murders for the viewing public. In the papers, in those days, theyd print pictures of where murders occurred and they always wrote X marks the spot where the corpse was. So we used Xs all through the film. When anyone connected with the picture thought up some way of using an X, Id give him a bonus. (OMalley). This sort of game that Hawks played with inserting Xs into the film is apparent in the lighting, props, and set pieces. The first time the viewer sees the use of an X is in the title cards for the film. Soon after that the viewer sees another X as Tonys shadow moves closer and closer to the club owner, leading to his death. The X stands as a foreshadowing of death, whenever one sees an X on screen, outside of the title cards, it can be assured that a murder will happen soon after. Perhaps the most famous example of the use of Xs in Scarface comes from the Valentines day massacre scene. A trellis is hanging above an alleyway in which the murders are about to take place. Here, again Hawks uses shadows and backlighting to illuminate the scene. The gun-downed characters are never seen but their silhouettes are. The camera starts high in the trellis, pans down to the shadows, and after being riddled with gun-fire ascends again to the trellis ending on seven Xs, symbolic for the seven murders just committed. The gang members just murdered by Tony were a part of the last real threat left against him, Gaffney. In the next scene, the viewer sees Gaffney hiding with a white X right over his head. The next significant use of an X comes with the actual murder of Gaffney. The scene that is presented is much more complex than just simply dealing with Xs, however. Gaffney and his crew are found at a bowling alley when Tony enters.
The scene of Gaffney's death is artfully photographed as a whistling Tony strolls into the bowling alley and cases the joint. A scorekeeper marks an X - strike - on Gaffney's scoresheet - hinting at his impending death. During his next turn, Gaffney approaches the line and squats down to hurl his bowling ball. As he releases the ball, loud and rapid gun-fire rakes his body and mows him down. The camera follows the ball he's thrown - it's another strike. The metaphor of the pins falling symbolizes Gaffney's own death. The ball knocks down all the pins except one - symbolically, the remaining pin spins and whirls, stubbornly teeter-totters for a second longer, and then finally topples over. ([...]). Here one can see the X placed on the scoresheet from Gaffneys strike, but perhaps more importantly are the pins shown at the end of the scene. In Scarface, there are three main players: Tony, Lovo (his boss), and Gaffney. Until this point, Tony has been the number two man to Lovo, and Gaffney has been his third place contender in the city. The slow falling of the third pin is Gaffney as he falls from the gunfire that is heard in the background. The last piece of the puzzle between Tony and being the king of the city is Lovo. Interestingly enough, the murder of Lovo is done without the use of an X and is done quite quickly (See the section about style for more). Overall the use of Xs throughout the film can be categorized differently all-together when compared to other films of this era. This time period of filmmaking didn't see such a heavy use of symbolism until Hawks Scarface came out.

Scarface as both a film and a piece of art is an interesting study for the studio production system of the day in Hollywood. It is clear that Hawks went about the filming of Scarface in a completely unconventional style, especially in relation to casting and the storytelling of a mobster as the hero. The restrictions of the production code on this masterpiece were a real shame. In some places, the release was delayed and even banned in Germany. The film essentially disappeared for over fifty years and wasn't re-released until after Howard Hughes death in 1979 (xroads.virginia.edu). Because of the scarring of this film by the censorship board, it never received any nominations or awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. When one looks at the style of Scarface and sees how uniquely it was composed and shot, it could only be hoped that in some way that would stand as reparations for the disdain that it received during its initial theatre run. Again, it is important to remember that this film may have been the centerpiece of gangster films in the 1930s, had the censorship board not have been so disdainful of it. That honor (instead) fell to two earlier Warner Bros. films that defined the genre (the three films formed a trilogy, of sorts) ([...]). Heres to Scarface going against the code and rewriting the rules of scriptwriting and motion picture making.",1386374400,2,14381,4.702499008330028

Call it a 'Tip of the Hat ' to the director Michael Mann? I don't think so. This production is not as classy either; poor print and/or little lighting and not as clever, scene for scene, in the look as Public Enemy. This is in a rack all it's own. Paul Muni, as Tony, had to really put on the act for this and he excels at it. George Raft is also good to look at - he's never displaying all of his charms tho at once, ever. My favorite character and actor here is Vince Barnett as 'Angelo' Tony's secretary. He's adorable. His film and tv bio is longer than my arm;  I must mention that the 1983 version with Al Pacino which we all love and nearly has it's own channel, taps most of this very story pretty much.

211802,5,6300181316,"As a film studies student, I like this movie on several levels:

1  It is one of the first real gangster movies, and set a standard for both film noir style films of the 30s and 40s, and for gangster films as a genre. There are scenes in this movie which are still being written into movie and TV shows today.

2  Its authenticity. The Chicago and Italian accents are a little difficult to understand, but the filmmakers were trying to make it as authentic as possible  as filmmakers do today. Also, sound on film technology was still in its infancy in 1932 (about 5-7 years old), and although it is not what you expect when you watch a contemporary film, it is a very good example of the time.

3  The social moralizing that is the ongoing conversation theme at the police station and newspaper office shows what a heavy influence the Hays Office actually wielded. Thereby never letting the audience forget that the main characters may be sympathetic, but they are really a menace to fabric of American society.

4  The suspense.  Even though a modern audience pretty knows what is going to happen in Scarface, getting to the end had to have been a bit of a ride for earlier audiences because they would have come to this film without expectations (and without seeing the same scenes/narrative filmed over and over in a hundred different movies and cop shows).

5  The last scene, with Tony lying in the gutter where the horses have been, is exactly the end foretold by the police in the beginning of the film when they questioned him about Big Louies death. It is gruesome, but rich with irony as the camera pans up to the Top of the World Tours sign (see Note).

Note: I also find it interesting that nearly every cinematic leading man who said they were on top of the world is usually dead by the end of the last reel (i.e.,Arthur ""Cody"" Jarrett [James Cagney] in White Heat, Jack Dawson [Leonardo DiCaprio] in Titanic). I don't have the stats on this, but I am pretty sure Tony Camonte was the first to say it  and die for his insolence.",1373846400,6,2042,4.46900269541779

211825,5,6300181316,"Scarface is simply one of the best, if not the best, American gangster films of the '30s (1932), brilliantly directed by Howard Hawks, and grounded on a superb performance by Paul Muni, in which Muni, as Tony Camonte muscles and shoots his way (temporarily) to the top of his profession selling prohibition liquor.  Hawks's direction is crisp, his scenes are lean and sharp and move the story along on its own terms and the force of its characters. Many of the scenes are cinematically memorable, full of oddities, quirks and even a good dose of humor: George Raft, a somewhat sensitive killer,  passing time by cutting out a chain of paper dolls; Boris Karloff gunned down in a bowling alley as we watch the last pin of his last ""strike"" totter and fall; the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (or something much like it) shown only in shadow; Muni's secretary (really just one of the boys, and not the brightest one at that) hampered in his duties because he can't write, can never seem to get the name of a telephone caller (until the last call he takes after he has been shot but just before he dies of his wounds) and who, in two brilliant moments (i) becomes so infuriated with the phone itself that he pulls his gun to shoot the offending mechanism and (ii) while handling yet another call in a restaurant being machine-gunned to pieces, cares only about the safety of his hat and can't seem to figure out that he is being doused because of a bullet hole in a vat of beer.  In addition to quality players like Raft and Karloff, Hawks makes brilliant use of his actresses, Ann Dvorak as Muni's sister and Karen Morley as Muni's boss's girl, whom Muni sets out to acquire with the rest of his boss's operation.  Both of the female leads exude sexuality in a way that (combined with the violence) could not have pleased the nascent Hays Office, established in 1930 but not really in the saddle until 1934.
The real force of the picture, however, lies in Muni's performance.  It seems curious that Muni was recognized as one of the leading actors of his generation and nominated for a best actor Oscar 5 times while appearing in only 25 or so films.  Although certainly not forgotten by film buffs and historians, his name doesn't seem to come up in many discussions of great actors of the '30s through the '50s.  Perhaps it is the incredible diversity of roles he played. His ""Tony"" is hardly recognizable as the same lead actor in The Life of Emile Zola, The Story of Louis Pasteur, or The Good Earth. (About this last role, Muni is reputed to have said that he was about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover.)  In any case, Muni is at his brilliant, scene stealing best here, using every trick imaginable to command the camera and create a character that at once a ruthless gangster with a slightly unhealthy thing about his own sister, who is also a bit sympathetic, charming and even funny. In one of my favorite moments, Muni is trying to impress ""Poppy,"" the girl he wants, with his ""swell"" new pad.  Asked if she likes it, Poppy says, obviously critically, ""It's a little gauche, don't you think?"" to which Muni replies enthusiastically, ""So you really like it?"" Maybe not an exact quote, but close enough.
The movie is also interesting for the way it tried to sidestep the impending Hays Code (disingenuously, I have to believe) by its opening message: ""This is the world as it is!  The government is YOUR government. What is it going to do about it? What are you going to do about it?""  Again, not an exact quote, but you get the idea.
All in all, a movie that really deserves to be seen not just by film buffs, and a reminder of what a remarkable actor Paul Muni really was.",1312156800,2,3674,4.526395173453997

Unlike the genre today, there is little attempt to connect the elements of crime with ""deep"" ""psychic"" or ""nationalist"" causes. Munni simply responds to his violent and macabre environment.",1279238400,5,561,5.534883720930233
211851,4,6300181316,"""Scarface"" was one of several films (e.g., ""Little Caesar"" and ""Public Enemy"") in the early 1930s that helped define an entire genre. They were preceded by several major silent era gangster films (e.g., ""Underworld"", ""The Racket""). Interestingly enough, the Broadway play ""The Racket"" (made into a silent film in 1928 by Howard Hughes) starred Edward G Robinson who went on to play the gangster in ""Little Caesar"".

Whereas ""Little Caesar"" was suggestive of the Capone figure, ""Scarface"" was definitely modeled after him, right down to the scar on his face.

By the time the film came out Capone was already in jail. But during production when Capone got wind of the filming, he sent his friend George Raft (1901-80) over to get a bit part and keep him abreast of developments. Raft became enamored of the film business and stuck with films; more money and less lead. He would go on to make several memorable films including ""Each Dawn I Die"" (1939), ""They Drive By Night"" (1940), and ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959). Raft is famous for turning down parts that proved successful for other actors in films such as ""High Sierra"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Double Indemnity"".

Paul Muni (1895-1967) plays Tony Camonte (aka Capone) as a brutal psychopath. Muni was already a distinguished actor, having received his first of 5 Oscar nominations in 1929 for ""The Valiant"" and having a very successful Broadway career in plays such as ""We Americans"", ""This One Man"" and his most successful ""Counsellor at Law"".

Boris Karloff (1887-1969) appears as one of the gangsters who is gunned down in a bowling alley. He just appeared in ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and would soon appear in ""The Mummy"" (1932) and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) that would cement his stardom.

Ann Dvorak (1911-79) plays Muni's sister. Dvorak started making films in 1916 when she was only 4 years old. She played bit parts until her acquaintance with Howard Hughes launched her career. She signed with Warners where she made dozens of films, but unhappy with the scripts, she moved to England, but unlike Bette Davis, Dvorak was not lured back.

The film was produced by Howard Hughes (1905-76). Hughes is best known as an eccentric billionaire, but in the late 1920s he turned his considerable talents to the movie industry and was responsible for a number of major projects, including ""The Racket"" (1928), ""Hell's Angels"" (1930), ""The Front Page"" (1931), ""Scarface"" (1932), and ""The Outlaw"" (1943).

Credit for the screenplay went to Ben Hecht (1893-1964), but in fact, several people worked on the script including W. R. Burnett (""Little Caesar"") and John Lee Mahin (""Beast of the City"").

Howard Hawks (1896-1977) directs. We think of Hawks as a Western director, but in truth, the gangster film is a Western with automobiles. Hawks was nominated 3 times for a DGA award - ""Red River"" (1948), ""The Big Sky"" (1952) and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). He was Oscar nominated for ""Sergeant York"" (1941). His only other gangster film was the classic film noir ""The Big Sleep"" (1946). This was his first film with Hughes and together they would make 3 more films.

As originally released the film caused such a stink from law-and-order proponents that Hughes shot additional scenes and relabeled the film ""Scarface: The Shame of a Nation"". The added scenes include a newspaper publisher admonishing the government and the public to fight gangsterism, and a police chief doing the same. Hughes even added a prologue. But to no avail. The film failed at the box office (although it did make back its costs)  and was assailed for promoting violence. In retaliation, Hughes pulled the film from circulation where it remained until after his death.

The failure of ""Scarface"" didn't hurt Paul Muni's career.  He would earn 3 more Oscar nominations and win for his role in ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (1936).

Al Capone would continue to be portrayed in films by such actors as Rod Steiger (""Al Capone""), Jason Robards (""The St Valentine's Massacre""), Ben Gazarra (""Capone""), Robert DeNiro (""The Untouchables""), and Anthony LaPaglia (""Road to Perdition""). My favorite Capone was William Forsythe in the TV series of ""The Untouchables"" (1963-4). Scarface would be re-made with Al Pacino in the title role in 1983. Directed by Brian De Palma, it was dedicated to Ben Hecht, the ""Shakespeare of the movies"", who worked on the original.

The film has merits for the powerful script and the quality of the acting, as well as its historical value. For sociologists it offers a gold mine of information about early 1930s behavior.",1273968000,,4576,4.972513089005235
211852,5,6300181316,"""Costillo slowed down too much."" -- Johnny Lovo

""Yeah, and now he come to a dead stop."" -- Tony

Still a powerhouse gangster saga full of raw violence and barely clothed lust after all these years, this may have been the defining moment in the genre. Maurice Coons had a heart attack before the film's release and didn't get to witness his story reaching immortality as Howard Hawks' treatment blazed across screens like a wildfire that couldn't be contained. Both Paul Muni and Ann Dvorak gave their second unforgettable performance of the year as gangster Tony Camonte and the sister he has something for, Cesca. Dvorak's Cesca is nowhere to be seen during the middle portion of this film, but such an impression does she make at the beginning and end, her character seems to frame the entire story. Muni is equally memorable as the inarticulate and brash gangster with animal magnetism who just wants more. Following his moving performance in I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, and hers as the doomed and restless Vivian who finds redemption at the shattering climax of Three On a Match, both cemented their place in screen history.

Though not as often mentioned when this film is talked about, Karen Morley's turn as the gangster's moll who gets off on the animalistic behavior of Tony but won't let him get a taste until he's the man in charge is splendid. Of all the fine performances here, however, it is George Raft's as the cool, coin-flipping gunman, Guino Rinaldo which has that extra something called star power. Raft would not want to foster this image and intentionally chose to portray the good guy after this, but his underplayed ""Little Boy"" was admired by the real gangsters he had grown up with and shows a charisma onscreen others critical of his talents wish they had. And if one of the gangsters looks a bit like Boris Karloff, it is because it is Boris Karloff. He is quite good as Gaffney, who introduces the machine gun to the streets when Tony makes a grab for the North Side. Partially shot at Harold Lloyd Studios, Howard Hughes would tire of Hays Office interference and told Hawks to make it as real as he could, resulting in a bona-fide screen classic.

Ben Hecht and a host of others worked on adapting Armitage Trail's (Maurice Coon) story for Hawks, which became a thinly veiled bio of Al Capone's rise to crime boss. The power of the infamous massacre on St. Valentine's Day still shocks, despite the decades of explicit cinema since.  In a war to control the flow of liquor during prohibition, underling Tony Camonte wants it all, and begins a grab for territory while his boss becomes a mere puppet. What he really wants is the high priced Poppy (Karen Morley) and the audience can see why. Morley is terrific in conveying Poppy's desire for the brutality Tony brings to the table, but denies herself the thrill until he's taken complete control. Helping him do that more than a little is Tony's right arm, the cool Guino (George Raft). Tony's sister, Cesca, wants to live life to the fullest, and wants Guino as well, but can do neither while her brother is alive. Dvorak is magnificent, and when she disappears for a time as the gangster saga gets hot, viewers are left chomping at the bit for her return, despite the mesmerizing story unfolding before them.

The cops know Tony is just like any other guy without Guino and his boys, however, and Hawks uses this aspect of the story to condemn the mob, using one of the cops to highlight the difference between outlaws of the west and the new gangster of the streets. There is a marvelous scene where Poppy shows where her real allegiance lies by a simple lighting of a cigarette. The best scene in the film comes after Guino gives in to temptation with Tony's sister and makes it permanent while he's away on business. What happens in a doorway and Cesca's reaction is still powerful. Trapped by the cops, Tony shows himself to still be a smalltime gangster, to the disappointment of his sister, who finally breaks the tie to him forever. Violent and raw, Hawks gave up trying to please the Hays office with an ending they'd approve, and Hughes finally released it in selected cities with Hawks' original ending to packed houses.

Dvorak was something else and this is a good glimpse of what that something was. She moved to Britain for a time with her husband during the war and offered her services to drive an ambulance. Morley would become a casualty of the Blacklist but become Lt. Governor of New York later. Four powerhouse performances and the fine direction of Howard Hawks add up to a screen classic, and perhaps the finest gangster saga ever put on film until The Godfather. It is still raw, still entertaining, and still packs a punch today. Just the chance to see Dvorak light up the screen with her elegance, masking the troubled fire beneath, is worth the price of admission. Another Howard Hawks masterpiece.",1272844800,2,4916,4.68287037037037

211855,5,6300181316,"This is a film where you really have to talk about the beginning, at the beginning, as it sets the stage both formally and narratively in many ways. A street sign - a striking, brief pan past an obviously artificial, oddly angled and heavily Expressionistic street-alley, and then past a restaurant employee bringing in a sign for the night, into the restaurant and to rest on a group of men talking loudly, the remains of a party around them. The loudest man is Big Louie - he talks in a thick Italian accent about ""having enough"" and how satisfied he is...but his buddies tell him that, Johnny Lovo, apparently wants more; maybe he'll have to do something about that. We haven't been told that these men are mobsters, but we get the gist; they're fat and happy in the midst of the Depression, drinking the forbidden liquor that they doubtless control - but Johnny and more importantly his top lieutenant Tony Camonte want more, as Big Louie quickly finds out to his chagrin, gunned down as he tries to make a phone call, the sound of whistling as the camera pans from the silhouette of his assassin down to his dead body. One fantastic shot - I'd say one of the most impressive opening shots I've ever seen - lasting about 3 minutes and 20 seconds, giving us a prologue of much that's to come: the casual brutality of the whistling murderer, the lust for the good life, the impossibility of letting anybody else have a part of the pie.

Tony is played by Paul Muni in a ferocious yet rather pathetic way - he's tough, ambitious, street-smart, quick on his feet, yet so blinded by his emotions and passions that he dooms all of those around him and cannot stop, cannot ever have enough. Shortly after taking out Big Louie, he sets his sites on the north side gangsters, including Boris Karloff's wonderfully cynical Gaffney, and then it's only his own big boss himself, Johnny Lovo, standing in the way of him taking the town (Chicago, obviously, and in many ways Tony is Al Capone). We get the St. Valentine's day massacre, a half-dozen drive-by machine-gunnings...all the while Tony is becoming a big shot, scaring everybody, romancing Lovo's girl Poppy (Karen Morley), while trying to keep his younger and very anxious sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak) away from any man but...himself? The undercurrent of incest is powerful throughout the film; I suppose one could try to come up with a psychological reading as to why Tony's forbidden desires turn him mad and towards a life of crime - there's no father in the picture and his mother though stern is completely ineffective - but I'm not sure it's really there. In any case, his ""protection"" of his sister is so extreme as to eventually cost him his best friend, Guino (a very charming, low key George Raft), and it's emblematic of the madness that never allows him to stop, seeming to ignore any possibility that he can ever be overthrown.

The film seems to alternate visually between the dark expressionism that we're introduced to in that first shot: the crazy action scenes which really are something for a film from that period, machine guns blasting and cars crashing rapid-fire for several minutes at a time, most memorably in the rat-ta-tat that accompanies months of dates in a calendar flying - and a brighter, smoother camera-work for a couple of ballroom scenes. Even in opulent surroundings at last, Tony is never sated. Even if you've never seen the film or it's dubious ""remake"", it's not hard to guess the fate that's in store for him, and the genius of the film is that though we may not be able to feel much for Tony, who is never anything close to sympathetic, we can at least care a little for those who surround him like moths near the flame. His ""secretary"", the illiterate Angelo (Vince Barnett) who brings the film down a little with some ill-judged and draggy humor that sounds straight out of the Marx brothers, even manages a touching death - faithful to the last.

This struck me as in some ways atypical of director Howard Hawks - at least, it differs from his later work in that the male relationships are nearly all antagonistic rather than comradely; this is a film revolving really around one man who is always alone in his obsessive need to rule and dominate, a man who never has equals in his mind, and at the end has no one but the sister whose life he ruined, and then...the only fate a gangster could have in a film that tries to be both sensationalistic (succeeding well) and moralizing (not really). The DVD offers the alternate ending as well, so you can see Tony both shot to death and hanged. Did you learn your lesson? With the caveats of the obvious and unnecessary ""message"" being pushed on the audience (really only overt at the very beginning and ending) and those lame bits of vaudevillian humor, this is pretty damn impressive and probably my favorite of the early 30s gangster cycle.",1252972800,,4882,4.648148148148148

Partly due to the better script and partly due to Paul Muni's trademarked over-the-top acting, the original Scarface holds up today far better than its arguably more famous Warner Brothers contemporaries (The Public Enemy and Little Caesar); whether you've seen the remake and want to see the original or whether you're just looking for an engaging gangster flick, check out the 1932 classic.

This movie is action-packed with few lulls and it's fun because of it, in this case.  Paul Muni, as ""Tony Camonte,"" the head gangster, is compelling and fun to watch. He's tough-as-nails until the end. The main women in here - Ann Dvoark and Karen Morely - are interesting, too. Don't be fooled by the billing of George Raft and Boris Karloff.  In this film, they have very small roles.

211859,3,6300181316,"While ""Scarface"" was a shattering and powerful film in 1932, time has not dealt with it kindly. Presented with a Forward which offers the film as a document to demonstrate the need for political action to curb organised crime and mob violence, Paul Muni stars as a practically neanderthal gangster who shoots his way to the top of the mobs during prohibition. Muni was a prestige actor who always immersed himself in his roles almost to the point of inertia. He is at his best here, completely and totally in character. His number one henchman is the novice George Raft who has little dialogue but lots of charisma. He mostly stands in the background flipping a coin. The film was the most violent of all the gangster films and there are endless shootouts including a brief recreation of the St Valentines Massacre. In fact, the Forward tells us that every incident depicted in the film is a recreation of an actual incident. The least dated aspect of the film is the performance of the sensational Ann Dvorak who plays Muni's teenage sister with none too subtle hints of incest. The ethnic background is also well depicted with Muni's mother less than enchanted with her violent son.

The print of the the film is not very good. The soundtrack comes and goes as the actors move to and from the microphones. The visuals are dark and the contrast is often poor so it is sometimes hard to see what is happening. The DVD includes an alternate ending which shows ""Scarface"" being hung rather than simply gunned down in the street. The alternate ending allows a judge to deliver a speech about the need to eradicate the gangsters and makes a more logical book end piece to the Foreword.

Of course, not to be confused with the Al Pacino work concerning Cuban refugees
back in the early 1980's, this SCARFACE motion picture is one of the earliestworks that is completely, immensely, unlimited in its brutality as shown by
those ruling the underworld in Chicago and elsewhere, in terms of forcing
saloons to buy spirits and beer from them, in the volumes  and amounts they
desired, the introduction of up to then unseen weaponry by gangs, which is the
rapid fire machine gun, and thoughtless execution of rival gang members, over
territory hegemony.

A questionable aspect, perhaps redundant, inexplicable or bizarre, is the
meshing of the underlying gang warfare events with the overprotective behavior
of the gang leader concerning his 18 year old sister, and her desire to form
marriage and leave the parental nest to build her own life.

The movie is slightly on the long-side due to the distraction of the family drama already mentioned; however, there is outstanding non-stop adrenalin
pumping action, in terms of brow-beating, man to man combats, pistol firing, explosions,  and mid-way, machine gunning let loose on the city, with some gangs taking out rivals, like fishing in a barrel teaming with specie.

PAUL MUNI, is remarkable, in his ability to be of a one-track-mind, laser-
focused in terms of showing a man's own self-made reality, that brings him
success in this particular line of business, which is gangsterism, and
eliminating rivals, overreacting exaggeratedly to risks to his leadership thru a
Macchevelian  form of action from start to finish.

The filming brings to life the script with immense realism, and despite having
been filmed almost 15 years before WWII, is completely believable, and viewers
will build a rapport with the characters, and city settings instantly, such is
the hyper-modern feel of the sets, (automobiles, night clubs, streets, night lights, gunfire, police, etc) with the only exception the technology of the
telephone, requiring an operator before each and every call made.

The motto of the current Whitehouse administration, conceivably was rooted in this work, considering the blackening of ""habeas corpus"" that is made in this
movie, shown as a tool that protects gangsters from being put into jail, with
the Patriot Act in the back of one's mind that suspended that right due to the
events of 9/11. Also, gun sales and lack of strong laws are at the top of list
of citizen complaints in 1930's, in dealing with the anarchy on the streets.

Paul Muni is remarkable also in articulating  a wicked personal sense of humor
in his dialogs, and interactions with his men and women,  that most will fail to
grasp, dismissing it as madness, which in the end, the character begins to
realize is the case.

The gang boss offers the advice in staying on top as: shooting first, relying on
yourself to do the shooting, and to be doing it often.

SCARFACE is also a critique of the wave of aliens from Sicily, thousands of whom
adopted the underworld lifestyle, and an education for the unwashed masses, as
social, sporting recreation clubs are fronts for gang hideouts: bowling alleys,
pool tables, expensive high-end theatres and restaurants are often attended by
the leadership. New technology, such as bullet proof car windows, and steel
plated doors, are introduced, as a reeactions to drive by shootings, molotov
cocktails, car chases, etc.

An element that sticks out from the grime of the underworld, are the tall, shy,
artistic and feminine, innocent classy women depicted here, as being the type
the gangsters deal with, when perhaps in reality, this is 180 degrees from what
it should be ; it makes for good entertainment (Anne Dvorak, Karen Morley.)

Clearly, this work is very touchy to show in public, as was the case with Ashley
Judd's N0RMAL LIFE picture.",1213833600,,4175,5.0509461426492
211886,5,6300181316,"The early 1930's of Chicago mob rule with the great ""immigrant"" performance of Paul Muni as the crazed smart suave mobster that overtook both North and South sides of Chicago during prohibition is a tremendous movie that was a landmark in motion picture history and should not to be missed by any fan of this genre.
The movie is non stop entertainment with great character portrayal and the great addition of showing the alternate ending scene on the DVD casts this movie in so many lights that it is little wonder it is considered the classic that it is.
The sociological importance on viewing gangsterdom sympathetically as a  way out of poverty where the individual pulls himself out of his straits by any means necessary despite murder and brutality OR the idea that principles of good and evil prevail and murder is murder and deserves to be punished is made explicitly clear by the two contrasting endings.
It may be easy to empathize with ""scarface"" and his distinct manipulation of the elements but his maniacal jealousy lacking loyalty, his paranoia and ultimately the distrust he shows for all even his sister is crystal clear by choosing his ultimate death as the coward deep down he is.
The psychological drama of depicting the 'immigrant"" made into a larger than life persona, unstoppable, achieving the ""will to power"" boundlessly, the craving for American success, money, the Blond, by overcoming one's own inferiority complex by ruthless behavior and finally justice gets it's due is certainly the public service this film is about.
Not to be missed, prophetic that this film preceded Hitler and the murders of the post Holocaust world we live in.

He is one of the last American directors to be considered a major artist. To some extent this is because, like those characters in his films who naturally discount their achievements, he refused to claim his work as anything but entertainment. He defined the good director merely as ""somebody who doesn't annoy you,"" and insisted ""I'm interested in having people go and see the picture, and enjoy it."" His films are so enjoyable that they have been dismissed as superficial. And they never annoy.",1210723200,2,658,4.831858407079646

211894,5,6300181316,"I see reviews here dating back to the year 2000. This review is for the Universal Cinema Classics release of Scarface that came out in May 2007. First off, the video and audio on this print are excellent. There is no hissing in the audio, and there are very few artifacts in the video. The extras are another matter. First there is an introduction by TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne who provides the same excellent short introduction that he would were Scarface playing in prime time on TCM and he were introducing it there - no more, no less. The only other extra is an alternate ending scene for Scarface. There is no commentary track, which is a shame considering this film, along with ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy"" form the founding trio of the gangster film in the sound era of the motion picture.

As for the movie itself, it is based on real events that happened in the criminal career of Al Capone, although Capone's criminal career had already ended with his conviction on charges of tax evasion six months before this film was released in April 1932. You know you're watching a Howard Hughes production when, during the first scene, a bar employee is sweeping up after a party held by one of Chicago's big gangsters and finds a bra among the confetti. The film shares some aspects with its gangster film predecessors - Tony Camonte is motivated by a desire for power just as Edward G. Robinson's Rico was in ""Little Caesar"", and also like Rico takes over the gang from a boss he perceives as weak. However, Camonte doesn't seem to have the pent-up rage of Public Enemy's Tom Powers. When Tony performs acts of violence it is usually related to gangland business. The actual deaths are strictly business, but the execution of the killings themselves are something Tony takes pride in - a sort of work of art on his part. Like Tom Powers, Tony Camonte is given a family background, but unlike Tom Powers, Camonte's family is a completely dysfunctional one. What is unique in this gangster picture is Tony's trio of love interests. He wants his boss' girl, Poppy, as a status symbol. He also seems to have a love affair going with the machine gun, acting like he has discovered America the first time he shoots one. Finally, Tony is in love with his own sister Cesca. Tony's only true fits of rage occur when he sees her with another man, and it is this loss of emotional control over this one issue that is ultimately his downfall. George Raft, an ex-gangster of sorts himself, is terrific as the smart and level-headed Guino Rinaldo, Tony's right-hand man. Finally there is Vince Barnett as Tony's extremely inadequate secretary in a bit of comic relief turned tragic at the end of the film. This film is truly a classic. I just wish Universal had put in a commentary track, for such a cinema landmark is certainly worthy of one. Highly recommended.",1180137600,22,2878,4.632093933463796
211895,4,6300181316,"i just watched and taped this movie from tcm.i really liked it.i thought,like many old movies it would be long and devoid of any action.boy was i wrong! all the events in the movie were based on real life happenings.it is set in a time where one of the biggest crime bosses just went down and 10 more are jumping in to take his place.so theres someone getting shot up in every scene! it was great! of course its done in a 1932 type way so you won't see any graphic violence gow we think of it today,but it was top of the line for its time.my favorite part is when the lead character is getting the building hes in shot to pieces and he looks up for a second at his shooters and sees their machine gun.and he gets really exited like a kid at x-mas and says""they got a machine gun you can carry around! i gotta get me one of those!"".i think its the best gangster movie ive ever seen and yes i have seen ""the godfather""",1159228800,3,916,4.094444444444444
211896,4,6300181316,"""Scarface"" starts off with a warning. The events depicted in the film are part of a real problem and it is up to the citizens to hold their government responsible. There were similar warnings at the beginning of ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy"" (both released one year earlier, 1931). All three films were trying to be more than just films. They were attempting to be the public's conscience. Of the three movies though I think ""Scarface"" is the most preachy.

 Take for example a scene where a group of citizens debate why the local newspaper keeps putting those stories of violence on its front page. The publisher of the paper agrues the people have a right to know whats going on. By printing these stories on the front page perhaps they will be able to shame them out of their town. Soon we get a medium shot of the man, he is suppose to be addressing the people in his office but instead he is looking directly into the camera. He is really talking to YOU. He is warning the audience unless they hold their government responsible nothing will change. This kind of moral preaching seems a little pretenious to me.

 Francois Truffaut once said there is no such thing as an anti-war film because when you watch the war scenes they are exciting. That may very well be true and I think the same can be said about these gangster pictures. How can you make a movie saying violence is bad and then flood the movie with violent scenes? Honestly, weren't the shooting scenes exciting to watch? Therefore I feel the movie contradicts itself.

 But enough with all this serious talk. ""Scarface"" was produced by Howard Hughes (I wonder why he didn't direct this one) and directed by Howard Hawks. It is probably the best of the three films I mentioned if only because of the violence. Hughes at the time would agrue, it's not violent, it's realistic. But what an odd choice I felt for Hawks to direct. I've always associated his name with other genres, mostly comedies such as ""20th Century"" and ""His Girl Friday"". Because of this it doesn't really feel like a Howard Hawks film, at least to me.

 The movie tells the story of a small time hood, Tony Camonte, (Paul Muni, it's a shame he didn't receive an Oscar nomination) who makes his way up to the big time. At first we see Tony working for Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins) a big shot on the southside of town. But Tony wants to control the northside as well, especially after he sees the way Johnny lives. Expensive clothes, expensive place to live, and a beautiful woman (Karen Morley). So Tony starts going over Johnny's head and becomes the new leader.

 A lot of people I bet are more familar with the Brian De Palma remake of this film with Al Pacino made in 1983. The two are as different as night and day. But I will not comment on which is better, mostly because they are two different movies and do not deserve to be compared.

 As you watch this original ""Scarface"" though you'll notice small roles for George Raft, as a friend of Tony's and Boris Korloff as a rival.

 Bottomline: Overly preachy tale of ""crime doesn't pay"" But is still one of the best gangster pictures of its time. Good performance from Paul Muni makes the movie watchable.",1135209600,4,3204,4.530329289428076
211897,4,6300181316,"Produced by Howard ""The Aviator"" Hughes, the original version of ""Scarface"" depicts the rise of Tony, a young Italian-American gangster, to underworld power in the 1920's America. His unscrupulous, relentless and unsympathetic actions are portrayed in a bravura performance by Paul Muni, but other, mainly female players, are by no means worse. The black humour every now and then eases the tough, violent script (although it certainly is less difficult to watch than current violent movies). Melodrama and tragic overtones also occur and the finale has its particular gradation, which leaves the story as a prey to its inevitable ending. The creators evidently tried to infuse the movie with a solid piece of social commentary and they have mostly succeeded, turning ""Scarface"" into one of the best movies of the sound film era's dawn.",1118361600,4,836,5.246268656716418

211900,4,6300181316,"Howard Hawk's Scarface will always stand as the epitome of the early 1930's gangster film. The early talkie stars Paul Muni as Tony Camonte loosely based on the real life Al Capone. The acting in the film is typical of the time period. Muni goes way over the top in his portrayal( something that DePalma tried to get Pacino to do in the 1983 remake).
There are several performances that stand out in the film. Most notably is that of the coin flipping George Raft as Camonte confidante Guino Rinaldi. The script was written by Ben Hecht who won an academy award even though it gets somewhat preachy in order to satisfy the movie censors.
The action is particularly well filmed even with the technical limitations of the day. Note the shootouts and car chases. Another interesting plot device is the placing of X's throughout the film when something bad is about to happen.
This film was long unavailable on DVD but can now be found in that format as part of the Scarface Deluxe Gift Set. I'm hoping that the film will be remastered and released on its own with some additional bonus material. For now the only additional material that is available on the disc is an alternate ending Hawks shoot to get the film past the Film Review Board which has a captured Camonte led off to face trial and execution for his crimes ( a sort of crime doesn't pay message that the censors insisted on).
Do yourself a favor and see Scarface as it was meant to be. This important film is in many ways superior to the 1983 remake but does stand as a bookend to that piece. Get out and see this great piece of gangster history.",1065484800,10,1607,4.469387755102041

Paul Muni stars as Tony, a ruthless neandrathal-like thug with a heater and a three piece suit who systematically takes over the illegitimate business of his goin' soft employer one burrough at a time.  George Raft is the epitome of slick, wolfish cool (check out the coin flipping, which Billy Wilder had Raft scoff at years later in SOME LIKE IT HOT, in a nod to this movie) as Guino, Tony's right hand man, and Ann Dvorak as Tony's off-kilter sister is one of the most seductive women ever to be cast in light and shadow.  Plus you've got Boris Karloff doing a turn as an Irish mobster...nice.
Surprisingly fast paced and brutal (great car chases -ever see a Model T roll down a hill?), this is spectacularly captured in black and white.  There is a bit of `What're YOU gonna do about it?' preaching in the middle (the DA actually points at the audience as he delivers his tirade against crime), but so what?  This one hits and hits hard.  A year later the film commission would never allow the incest and the violence (in subsequent showings, a scene was actually tacked on the end in which Tony was brought in alive, and a stand-in filmed from the back stood in handcuffs before a finger wagging judge who sentences him to life in the cooler -or is it execution, I forget? - for his crimes) in later American films.
