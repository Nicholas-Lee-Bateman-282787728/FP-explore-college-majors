8561109,5,B00B1UAO4K,"David Niven has more great movies than you can shake a stick at. Unfortunately some of his best movies are virtually impossible to obtain. I was lucky to get a copy of this film off the cable. Hopefully it will be on DVD soon. ""The Impossible Years"" is available on video. ""The Statue"" has not shown up even on cable.

One of the surprising things about ""Prudence and the Pill"" is the number of actors that you will recognize from that era. You may recognize the niece Geraldine Hardcastle played by Judy Geeson of "" To Sir with Love 2 (1996) (TV)"" fame. I will not go through the list of actors. However you get the idea.

The plot is quite simple and you can guess the outcome. The real worth is in the acting and the details. Not everything goes quite as expected. Half of the women in the village are taking vitamins that mysteriously look like BC pills. And many are taking BC pills that mysteriously look like aspirin. Do not let this film give you any ideas.",1403654400,2,965,4.355555555555555
8561110,3,B00B1UAO4K,"Though they live under the same roof, a wealthy banker (David Niven) and his wife (Deborah Kerr) live separate lives. He has a mistress (Irina Demick), she has a lover (Keith Michell). But when his young niece (Judy Geeson) switches her mother's (Joyce Redman, TOM JONES) birth control pills with aspirin, it leads to a chain reaction of unexpected pregnancies for almost everyone. Oh those swinging 60s have a lot to answer for and PRUDENCE AND THE PILL is one of them. It's garish looking (it's all orange and blue rooms and pink and purple dresses) with the requisite ""swinging"" underscore and taking advantage of the screen's new sexual freedom. I suppose a comedy about the birth control pill was inevitable but couldn't it have been funnier? Mercifully, they avoided putting Edith Evans in a mini skirt but no one comes out looking very good. Hugh Mills wrote the screenplay based on his book so I suppose we can lay the blame at his feet. Directed by Fielder Cook. With Robert Coote, David Dundas and Moyra Fraser.

The region 2 DVD from Odeon Entertainment is a handsome and colorful anamorphic wide screen transfer (1.66)",1383350400,2,1130,4.824742268041237
