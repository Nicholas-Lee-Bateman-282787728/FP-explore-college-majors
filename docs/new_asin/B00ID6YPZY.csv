8640993,2,B00ID6YPZY,"I purchased this title recently after looking for the movie on DVD for many years. The movie had been a favorite of my youth and Edison Marshall's book had been in my parent's library. That said, I found it difficult to watch more than the first five minutes of this particular print due to the exceptionally poor video and sound quality. I can only presume that it was either copied from VHS tape or literally filmed off of an old tube TV broadcast. Anyway, I wanted the film in the worst way, and got it -- in just that way. I can only hope that it will one day be released in a fully restored/remastered Technicolor version to do justice to the original movie. Until then, I have... what I have.",1394755200,8,698,4.33587786259542
