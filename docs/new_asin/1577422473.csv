8274820,5,1577422473,"Talk about one of the great unknowns. This cartoon movie special about divorce is fantastic. It takes a creative and well-thought out look at divorce through a kid's eyes. The animation is good(not stellar, but good), and the music is awesome. See if you don't end up humming that circus piece over, and over, and over again. The special also boasts an all-star cast including Carrie Fisher and Danny Devito.
  Our little protaganist, Molly, has her world fall apart as her parents announce their divorce. She then proceeds to try to keep them together, and herself together, as well. After a series of miss-adventures, the story ends with Molly coming to an acceptance of where she and her parents are in life.
  This is an awesome show, and is well worth the purchase, whether or not your kids are going through a situation like this.",1253836800,,836,4.744827586206896
