8274528,5,B0019M7LC8,Hollywoodism is outstanding. It offers an account of the Hollywood studios in a large historical setting of late 19th century European anti-semitism. It offers a compelling reading of various films and of particular scenes within films. It is a model of clarity in its argument and its presentation. I recommend it in the highest terms.,1388534400,,336,5.127272727272727

8274530,5,B0019M7LC8,"I have been using this documentary for about a decade in my undergraduate course, Y200 Politics and Film.  It takes off from Neil Gabler's book, An Empire of Their Own, to document the role of the Jewish moguls in the development of the major Hollywood studios up until their decline in the wake of McCarthyism.  A strong theme is the success of the moguls of portraying a vision of America that was a melting pot of ethnic groups which included Jews and African Americans, even though reality never matched that vision while they were alive.  The film strives to prove that the effort of the moguls to ""blend in"" prevented them from taking an early stand against the Holocaust.  They were punished for their Jewishness during the McCarthy era.  The film is weak on explaining why the studios were replaced by the current multimedia conglomerates, but its strengths are sufficient for giving undergraduate students an excellent introduction to the history of Hollywood.",1301443200,5,969,4.95679012345679
