8164626,3,B000LW7L2W,"This French documentary features interviews with many of those closest to Andy Warhol, but there is almost no footage of Andy himself speaking. It covers the basics of his life, but seems kind of perfunctory. The extra disc contains leftovers of interviews. The soundtrack sounds a bit Velvet Undergroundish. Not very impressive overall.",1268006400,,337,5.377358490566038
8164627,4,B000LW7L2W,"This film is a unique reexamination of Andy Warhol. It weaves the major events of the avant-garde icon's life into a fictional musical. Wildly famous as the creator of pop art, an innovative filmmaker and a flamboyant celebrity, Warhol lived his life as a giant piece of performance art. Interviews with Warhol and members of his entourage -- including Karl Lagerfeld and Warhol's brother -- shed light on the legacy of the legendary artist. Not one of the best documentaries but still a must see!",1214956800,,497,4.858823529411764
8164628,3,B000LW7L2W,this dvd features some footage which makes it worth having for a Warhol fan...I found the music to be ( though no doubt well intentioned ) very distracting and ill-conceived...,1198800000,3,176,4.9
8164629,1,B000LW7L2W,"I own at least four other Andy Warhol DVD documentaries and this is the worst one I have ever seen. Everything about this DVD is poor quality from the bad music, DVD menus, story line and ending with horrible camera work, don't waste your time watching this DVD. The PBS Warhol documentary is so much better.",1182470400,3,308,4.517857142857143
8164630,4,B000LW7L2W,"This tape offers many new insights and largerly unseen footage on Warhol that anyone seriously interested in Andy Warhol would want to see. Bob Colacello's presence also adds to the commentary, though Fred Hughes is noticeably absent.",1179187200,4,234,5.351351351351352
