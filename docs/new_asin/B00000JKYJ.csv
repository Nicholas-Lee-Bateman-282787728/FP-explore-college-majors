7912330,4,B00000JKYJ,"I've had the good fortune of visiting all of FDR's homes, which is a must-do experience for all who admire our greatest 20th century President. There's nothing like standing in the room in Campobello where FDR was stricken with polio, or seeing the scratches made in the door from Fala, when he realized his master was dead at Warm Springs. But for many, it's impractical to travel thousands of miles to see these sites first-hand. This video is the next best thing.
The camera takes you into every room of Hyde Park, Campobello and Warm Springs and you can vicariously experience the joy of touring these grand, historic places. The narration could be better, but I recommend turning off the sound after the first viewing and just luxuriate in the visual images. This is a great addition to any FDR collection, or for armchair travelers. I especially recommend this for younger viewers, who were not alive when Roosevelt guided America through its most tumultuous years (aside from the Civil War).",976406400,5,998,4.876470588235295
