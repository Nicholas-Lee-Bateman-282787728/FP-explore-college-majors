8018748,4,B0001Z48TI,"Enjoyed Awakening DVD very much.  A lighthearted romantic movie.  Somewhat of a comedy-drama.  While the story was highly unlikely (in my opinion) I found it rather entertaining and it held my interest.  I would definitely recommend it to others for viewing. Note:  I've always admired David Beecroft's acting abilities, however, I've not seen him in anything lately.",1207699200,,367,5.368421052631579
8018749,5,B0001Z48TI,"As you May have seen my reviews are only on great movies this movie falls into that category I can not belive this movie was not nominated for any awards however. This is a touching movie of a very independent and geeky doctor (Robin Williams) in a hospital with patcients suffering from similar diseases and his studies and methods to cure them are tremendous. One of the Patcients (Robert De Niro) is cured for a brief period of time and starts a uprise in  the hospital as they will not let him out just so he can do the simple things that everyone takes for granted this is another rather depressing movie and if I where nominating movies for awards this would be one that I would.

Highly Recomended",1139702400,,704,4.449612403100775
8018750,5,B0001Z48TI,I think I've watched this film at least 20 times on WE.  It is such a dear storyline.  David Beecroft is a natural actor and he continues to impress me each time I view the movie.  Geary is perfect for her role and they play each other beautifully!  When the DVD came out I was thrilled and purchased it.  I continue to watch it on WE when it is shown.  I wish there could have been a sequel.  My favorite movie!

8018751,5,B0001Z48TI,This movie was ordered at the same time as another movie I got. It took longer than expected but well worth the wait.,1127779200,,117,4.130434782608695
8018752,5,B0001Z48TI,"Here we have a herione who appears to be lovable but emotionally scarred [well at least a little timid].

Sara had been dumped by the banker [who, grin, is now married and the father of twins].  She runs a small victorian boarding house.

She is in the process of putting up the screens [from the roof, no less] and is talking to herself [mostly about her missing boarder]

She figures her boarder has returned [I think she wants her rent money?] and shoves into his room, only to be grabed and frightened by a strange man with a gun.

Ah yes, enter the handsome [and I mean really good looking, with dimples] bounty hunter, Flynn.

I don't remember who her friend was but she has a wacky interest in Sara finding a boy friend.

Well, Sara gets ahold of the sheriff to rescue her from this gun-man only to find out that the sheriff knows Flynn.  Hilarious!

She invites herself along with Flynn's stake-out of her boarder and it just esculates from there.

Sara is no risk taker but gets involved with Flynn and his family [his car] which she almost wrecks.  [I was a bit disappointed when she decides to go for him and climbs into bed still knowing he does not do commitments.]

On the whole I enjoyed this movie a third time around and definitely enjoyed the songs and David Beecroft's acting of the Flynn character.  Very sensitive and emotional.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Harlequin Romance along with most of the others.",1109721600,23,1421,4.543307086614173
8018753,1,B0001Z48TI,I thought the movie was horrible.  Very little chemistry.  The acting was poor.,1108944000,3,79,5.0
