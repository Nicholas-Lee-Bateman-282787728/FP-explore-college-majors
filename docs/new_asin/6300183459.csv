217629,4,6300183459,"Though not exactly a masterpiece, FIRESTARTER is a far better thriller than the critics led people to believe when it was first released in 1984.
Based on Stephen King's 1980 novel, this film stars Drew Barrymore (fresh off her role in Spielberg's 1982 masterpiece E.T.) as Charlie McGee, a very young girl whose parents (David Keith, Heather Locklear) were part of a government-sponsored scientific experiment that gave the participants various types of psi powers.  Barrymore's power is unique and, to put it mildly, incendiary.  Just by thinking about it, she can start fires--pyrokinesis.  And she is most apt to do that when she is under stress or angry.
Given the fact that agents from a secret government agency known as the Shop have been after her, one can see why she'd use them, even though she doesn't want to.  But the top two men (Martin Sheen, George C. Scott) in the Shop want her powers to be harnessed into the ultimate weapon.  The thing they forget, of course, is that they should be careful what they wish for; they may get it.  And in the explosive, fiery finale, they do indeed get it.
Though not quite up to the cinematic standards set by CARRIE or THE SHINING, FIRESTARTER does benefit from a very good performance by Barrymore, and Keith isn't too bad either.  Sheen (who played a political heavy in another King adaptation, THE DEAD ZONE) and Scott (the 1970 Oscar winner for PATTON) make for two very good villains.  The special effects work by Mike Wood and Jeff Jarvis, who worked on both E.T. and POLTERGEIST, though not totally unflawed, also works wonders.  Like another reviewer, I think FIRESTARTER could easily have passed for a 'PG-13' rating, instead of an 'R'.  Unfortunately, such a rating didn't exist yet when the film came out in the winter of 1984.
Combining science fiction with suspense and the supernatural, FIRESTARTER is an effective thriller, well worth watching, even if Stephen King is not your particular cinematic bag.",1012953600,5,1972,4.859701492537313
217630,5,6300183459,"Every time that I've seen this movie, I have to ask the question: How come that ""Firestarter"" got the R rating instead of PG-13?  I feel that this movie should have gotten the PG-13 rating because there isn't enough stuff in this movie that could have supported the R rating.  Yes, there is a ""Armageddon"" like ending in ""Firestarter"" but there is a difference between the two.",972864000,,377,4.611940298507463

I saw it like 10 times durring the 5 nights I had the video! Call me a FAN! I love Firestarter  because of an innocent child who was just trying to live a normal life like  any other normal girl. I think there is nothing wrong with having special  pyrokinetic powers, it was just too bad that ""The Shop"" was after  her, and didn't want to leave her alone! But in the end, things seemed to  work well for her. I think the movie has charactor and is full of suspense  and energy! I hope someday Hollywood comes out with a second part, that  would be so cool, more ""fire""! I also just bought the book by  Stephen King, I'm so excited that now I can finally read the story!

217635,3,6300183459,"This film was one of the first King adaptation movies I saw. I have actually bought this myself to own, though this is mainly because of the concept (original at its time) of a pyrokinetic child.
As with most King  adaptations, the film doesn't compare to the book. It looses the pain and  suffering of her father, and the strange effects he has on people  (specifically, the man fascinated by his waste disposal  unit....).
However, it is an enjoyable yarn. The special effects are  quite good for the time, and the sight of a six year old loosing control  over such a deadly force is enough to make most people shudder. I would  recommend buying it for the scene at the farm alone!
It is not a  brilliant film, though. You can poke holes in it if you're in the mood, and  there is no real horror or terror there, it's just fun. Try renting it  first!",926380800,4,852,4.369426751592357

217721,5,6300183459,"I have always loved this movie; Drew Barrymore was at such a young stage of her life, being only 8 at the time, and being able to withstand the pressures of a movie filming schedule at that age is just amazing. I have seen this movie many time on television, of course, but seeing it here, and in Blu Ray, is just 'icing on the cake', and now I can watch it anytime I want, commercial free. This definitely gets 5 stars, and if by chance anyone has not had the opportunity to see this, I recommend you get it. Even the stunts, and that actual creation of the fire through whatever they had at the time for special effects, is fascinating; and to think they did it all on a $10 million budget, although as stated in 'The Making Of...."" documentary, nowadays that sort of budget would be more like $60 million. I've wondered to myself if it was ever considered for a remake, what with special effects technology being what it is now, and if it were, and if they could find an 8 year old to fill Drew Barrymore's shoes, I think it would make for a very good show -- I would pay the $16 for a movie ticket, which is what it would cost where I live.

217774,4,6300183459,"As most know this is a movie adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name made in the early 1980s, starring a still very young (about 8 year old) Drew Barrymore.  She is in a sense a product of a government drug experiment (her parents were given an experimental drug while in college and ended up with powers) who can start fires with her mind.  The story is told partly in flashbacks and in the present while Charlie (Barrymore's character) and her father are on the run from government agents.

The movie apparently stays pretty faithful to the novel (I have not read it, but in the making of commentary it was stated that the screenplay was basically just a pared down version of the novel, without major changes).  The most notable actor in the movie at the time was George C Scott, but it also boasted a still fairly young Martin Sheen, Heather Locklear and some other recognizable character actors.  The writing and acting was very good, and the story hold up well even after all these years.  Barrymore did a good job having to carry a lot of the movie despite being so young.  While a lot of what she had to do was look angry a lot and cry, she did remarkably well with the dramatic material for being so young.  The only thing that does not hold up well, and is probably amplified in hi-definition are the special effects.  Given the time even the best CGI was limited (especially for a movie that did not have an enormous budget) so the fireballs and ricocheting bullets at the end looked very cheesy.

For those who get the disc, the blu-ray transfer is about as good as you can expect for a movie this old.  The extras include an audio commentary track with the director, an almost hour long making of feature with interviews with some of the actors and filmmakers.  Unfortunately neither Barrymore or Martin Sheen or any of the other main actors in the film were interviewed for it which would have been nice to see (obviously George C. Scott passed away many years ago and could not be).  There is also a feature on the music, trailers and promotional spots and a stills gallery.  Very good for what is included.

As I said the movie holds up fairly well over the years.  Unlike some of the other movies adapted from King's novels, it is not overtly scary (like IT for example).  It is more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror movie.  I remember seeing it when I was very young (around the time it came out).  I  am a year younger than Barrymore, and I was not freaked out  by it even back then.  It is definitely worth checking out and the extras on the blu-ray (for those who like going through the bonus materials) make it worth the pickup.",1499040000,,2679,4.424489795918367

217891,5,6300183459,i recall this in my  child hood in the 1980s and it still holds up.  The most moving thing about this movie on how much Charlie and her father Andy loved each other so much as most father/daughters do.  in this movie espeacially  since they only have each other since Victoria was brutally murdered by the shop.  The running and being hunted by the shop fueled their rage until it boils over.  Andy along with his wife tried for years for Charlie to control her powers. Only when she burned her mother's hand warmers when she got angry when she vowed to almost never use the power again except burning the shoes of that dead beat father soldier at that airport and killed the shop agents attempting to abduct her and kill her dad..  Only after she witnessed her father being shot and dying when she let use her full power in extreme grief/rage and her father's dying wish to kill anyone in her way plus destroy the shop completely.,1488153600,,931,4.4411764705882355

218122,5,6300183459,"They really did an excellent  job with the Bluray transfer. I have seen some other movies of the same genre and of the same era (80s) that had very poor bluray transfer. Thank God, this is not the case here. This is the good news. Bad news is that there are no extras or bonus features.

As for the film itself, I actually think it holds up better than I remembered it. I had seen it many years ago on VHS tape and I remembered liking the movie. I have recently started to build Stephen King movies collection so I picked this up to add to my collection. I think this is one of the best Stephen King movies out there. I don't expect movies to be hundred percent faithful to the source material so in my opinion,  being a good adaptation and being a good movie are mutually exclusive things.

I think the movie was very well-directed, flashback scenes were edited appropriately, acting was quite good (George C Scott steals the movie with a great performance; his Rainbird character is one duplicitous villain played with perfection) although I think Drew Barrymore did also a great job portraying Charlie, the little girl with a terrifying supernatural gift and affection for her father. Special effects were awesome. I've read some criticisms about the special effects in this movie; quite frankly I have no idea why anyone would complain about the special effects in this movie unless they are expecting CGI effects. Personally, I prefer old-fashioned special effects. I am happy this movie was made with the special effects that were used back in the day.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Stephen King movies, or enjoys fantasy/sci-fi genre. If you are fan of X-Men, you should definitely give this movie a chance (I could clearly imagine Charlie joining the X-Men). Other Stephen King movies that I like and recommend: Christine, Cujo, Carrie, The Dead Zone, Salem's Lot (1974), The Shining (1980), Silver Bullet and Misery.",1431475200,9,1946,4.7626112759643915

218167,5,6300183459,"I like a good jigsaw puzzle, but only if it doesn't take a month to put together.  This movie has all the elements to be a great viewing experience.  However, the director didn't know how to put it together.  He had a stellar cast, fantastic pyrotechnic effects, and a script based on one of Stephen King's most popular novels.  The only thing the director lacked was pacing.  After a promising start, where the father and daughter are being chased by King's usual bevy of evil US government agents, the movie quickly loses steam and falls flat.  One can practically sense the growing disappointment coming over the actors as they realize the production they're in is slowly falling apart.

The photography is beautifully executed, and the fireworks excite the eyes.  The film boasts a one-in-a-million collection of famous actors, all given enough screen time for the audience to enjoy them practice their craft.

The Blu-ray disk's audio and video are sharp and crisp.",1414972800,,970,4.938271604938271

218181,3,6300183459,"Having just re-read the King novel, I was interested in seeing this movie again, just to see how close it stuck to the source material. I will say that it's a pretty good adaptation of King's story, and stay pretty close to the source material.

As the movie opens we see Andy McGee and his young daughter, Charlie, running from some obvious 80's government henchmen. Using his psychic power, Andy tricks a cab driver to take them to a distant airport in hopes of eluding the agents. We get a quick flashback and learn that Andy met Charlie's mother while in college and taking part in a medical experiment for a drug called Lot 6. Once injected Andy was able to read people's minds both he developed psychic powers. Also because of Lot 6, Charlie can also has psychic abilities, her most powerful is the ability to ignite fires. At the airport Charlie takes a disliking to a soldier arguing with his girlfriend, and lights up his boots. We now know why and who the shadowy agents are after.

I remember seeing this film ages ago, but remembered almost nothing about it except for the fiery finale. I wasn't the biggest fan of the novel, and the flaws that I found there are also evident in the film, if anything they are magnified simply because the novel provides greater character development and a slower pace. With that said, my favorite part of the novel is the same thing I really enjoyed about the movie, and that's the character of Rainbird, here played by George C. Scott. Scott just oozes an evil charisma that you can't look away from.

The cast overall is really good, and you almost wish they were part of a better story. ""Firestarter"", both the novel and the film, feel pretty dated. Both seem to reflect the time of the Vietnam/Watergate/Kent State 60's & 70's, and now, 40 years later in the age of Wikileaks, 24-hour investigative news and the internet, the evil government agency trope has kind of lost it's fangs.",1414368000,5,1933,4.597101449275362

Drew Barrymore and Keith David shine as a father and daughter on the run from the sinister minions of The Shop. I loved Heather Locklear as Charlie's mother in the movie. Some of you out there who are reading this review may also remember her in a TV show, a crime drama called TJ Hooker. William Shatner also starred with her in the show. George C Scott as Rainbird, the assassin of The Shop, known as John the orderly to Charlie, gives a stellar performence in this film! The use of the special effects in regards to Charlie's unique pyrotechnic abilities is very well done without going overboard in their use. I think the picture quality on Blu-ray is much better than VHS video or regular DVD video. This is a  great Blu-ray Disc for anyone who enjoys a good edge of your seat thriller. Buy it.

218253,4,6300183459,We enjoyed watching this film again after all these years. It is a fun story to watch. Do not expect realism in a scifi drama. It is made for fun. The quality of the transfer looked like it came from 3/4 in tape. Much better than vhs but not a film transfer. Netflix does not carry this and may never do so. There are situations in this film that are not acceptable to some of the viewing public.,1382054400,,396,4.089743589743589
218254,4,6300183459,"Thankfully there are actually Stephen King adaptations out there that still manage to turn out half-way decent, and this movie is one of them -- great sound effects (the drumming when the father attempts mind control), the creepy dream flashbacks (his voice in slow motion while they're receiving the experiment), a high body count, some shocking scenes (a man hemorrhaging from his eyes), great cast, class A directing, and an emotionally wrenching subplot. I have noticed some find this boring -- it is more slow-paced in the first half as we work through all this build up, but boring? Never.

 Like in Carrie, when Telekinesis was explored, King now ventures into another rare area: pyrokinessis. The ability to start fires from sheer will of the mind -- little Charlie (Drew Barrymore) and her father Andy harbor a horrifying history and a secret worth killing for.

 Charlie's parents, pre-birth, meet where they're both in a room about to receive the dosage of an experimental drug (Lot 9) given by an organization called ""The Shop."" But the experiment goes horribly awry -- except for one thing. It has given Andy the ability to control people by catching them with their eyes (think Vampire) and this power, while physically harmful to him, is interesting to the owners of this secret organization. But due to how destructive this power is, and how much it weakens him, it's not of much use to The Shop, until their interest is piqued big-time when the two have a child, a little girl, whose stuffed toys automatically go up in flames when she gets pissed.

 The newlywed's dreams have come true, but so have The Shop's, who see in her the perfect killing machine/scientific discovery. And the group is determined to have her...at all costs. I won't give away any more details on what happens, but it's a lot, and it's pretty believable. If this condition and organization existed this is exactly how these people would respond and behave. A very character-orientated picture.

 The cast and acting is superb and you feel every heartache, every betrayal. Martin Sheen is the owner of this organization. Martin Sheen plays Captain Hollister but I won't ruin who and what his character is. He's basically the same role here as he was in the Dead Zone. When Charlie's mother is shown it's a pre-fame, very young Heather Locklear. She doesn't have that Melrose Place snobbery around her yet, does an excellent job. Drew Barrymore had talent from the beginning and she's better in this than ET, more emotions are shown and you feel for her the entire way through. Her father Andy (David Keith) is perfectly cast and has a certain screen magic.

 A lot of people die and the majority are burned to death through Charlie's ability. But if I'm giving off the impression she's evil in any way, I don't mean to. The exact opposite. A pretty sweet kid, believe it or not, and this helps drive the knife in even deeper for an emotional effect.

 I mentioned the directing very briefly above but I need to mention it again. Excellent shots of Charlie when she's about to start a fire (her hair blows behind her head, not as silly as it sounds), great effects with bullets that are shot her way, FIREBALLS!!, just all around great stuff. There's really a lot of drama and story throughout involving the girl's family and constantly being on the run, and it's told through more than her point of view, but also the father's and the villains.

 Not much fright factor unfortunately...the movie isn't creepy but it is interesting. It doesn't pass out buckets of blood either but it's not completely dry.

 A sadly overlooked film that has a quiet intrigue about it, underrated and talented. It may need a little patience from the more hyper audience members, but if ignored and left behind, it's only the viewer who ends up getting ""burned.""",1379635200,,3833,4.784848484848485

218256,2,6300183459,"Firestarter is the adaption of the Stephen King novel of the same name.  Firestarter is pretty much a mixed bag.  Most people hate this film including Stephen King himself.  While I do not hate the film as much as most people I do think it is one of the weaker Stephen King movie adaptions that I have seen.  It has some good stuff in it, but an equal amount of bad things to offset it.

The film starts off nicely.  You have Andrew (David Keith) and his daughter Charlie (Drew Barrymore) on the run from this top secret government group called The Shop.  The Shop is headed by Captain Hollister (Martin Sheen) and John Rainbird (George C. Scott) Andrew underwent an experiment done by the Shop where he took a special drug which gives you psychic powers of some kind.  In Andrew's case he can force people to do what he wants.  His daughter Charlie obtained a gift of her own through the genes called Pyro-Kinesis which allows her to produce fire with a thought.

The first half hour of those two on the run I actually enjoyed.  The final act was also engaging.  She learns to control her abilities, escapes the facility and kills all the agents in the process.

However, the middle portion of the film is where things fall apart for me.  After a certain point, Andrew and Charlie are apprehended by The Shop.  After that you have nearly forty minutes of them trying to befriend Charlie in order to get her to use her ability for them.  They also experiment on Andrew and give him medication.  It is literally forty minutes of them being experimented on.  I found it incredible boring and unneeded.  Most of it just seemed like time filler.

Many of the performances did nothing for me as well.  Some of the cast does alright.  David Keith and Martin Sheen do a good job most of the time, though Martin Sheen can be very over-the-top in places.  Drew Barrymore was not good at all.  She did grow as an actor thankfully.  I've seen some other films of hers and she is a fine actress.  However, she did not do a good job here.  George C. Scott I did not think did that well either.

The film has many good things in it.  The beginning and the end were fun to watch.  The score is good especially the music played at the end.  The effects are a bit dated, but are fine overall.  However the acting is not that good.  Plus the middle is pretty dull.  I have not read the entire book, so I cannot comment if it was faithful to the source material or not.  From what I have read, they did not change too much, but I have not read that much of it.

Overall, Firestarter is one of the weaker Stephen King adaptions that I've seen.  I would skip it.  The book is most likely better.",1376784000,,2674,4.327272727272727

It's fun to see Drew Barrymore as a child again.  She was fascinated with all the rings I wore back then.  David Keith was very gracious and Martin Sheen was just a good guy all the way around. Not George C. Scott.  He had nothing to do with anyone.  Guess it takes all of his thoughts, all of the time to play a part.

The producers,directors and whole crew were so professional and helpful.  It was amazing to watch them put this 'Firey' story together and the special effects won awards and got a lot of notice in the industry back in the eighties.

The description of The Shop and how they treat poor, little Charlie and her father is heart wrenching and you route for her completely when she finally gets her revenge. You really
feel for the father and daughter and understand just how heartless their captors truly are. This is a good, disturbing, paranormal thriller but it deals more with speculative science fiction horror more than the typical horror that Stephen King is known for.  The story is timeless enough where I think it's just as powerful now as it was at the time it was first written.

This is a based on a timeless tale by Stephen King. As there are many factions and cabals that today want to control their own firstarter.

This early film starring Drew Barrymore is interesting. While not a great movie, the acting is excellent from everyone, especially Ms. Barrymore. For once, Academy Award winner George C. Scott doesn't have that annoying guttural sound in his voice from Patton (which is a hell of a war picture); he also didn't have that sound in Anatomy Of A Murder or the 1982 version of Oliver Twist. The special effects are really good, considering that this was made in the early 1980's. My only reservation about this movie is that God's name is profaned several times.

The best part of the movie is the very end where Charlie takes her revenge on all the government scumbags that kidnapped her father and herself, and they even killed her father with an intention of wanted to coerce Charlie to use her unfortunate pyro-telekinesis for government power and gain against her will.

If you play it back on an HD TV, then be prepared for black all round the video - the black from the letterboxing and the black that the TV puts on the sides because the film is 4:3 video. Some TVs might blow it up at the correct aspect ratio to fit the screen. Ours does not. It's either watch it small or stretched.
I suppose this DVD is older, from when widescreen was kind of a new thing.

218333,4,6300183459,"If you liked the movie called Scanners and if you liked the movie Christine, then you will probably like Firestarter.  They are all similar pace wise and have some similar music in the background.  I never read the Firestarter book so I can't compare them right now.

The acting is a little unbelievable when it comes to the secondary acting (ie goverment agents that act weird and goofy for no reason), but the main actors do a darn good job for how many takes they were given.  Drew Barrymore is mostly realistic, except for two scenes where she seems to be at the end of a long day of shooting.  David Keith has those hypnotic eyes and his bonding with Drew was quite good in realism. Freddie Jones has that panic look in his eyes, but he did better in Dune if you ask me.  But then with the budget of Dune, you get more Freddie.  Martin Sheen has some nice psycho moments and he gets similar screen time in the movie Spawn.  Obviously he acts better in West Wing, but then he is pretty young in Firestarter.  Art Carney plays an old farmer and he made me laugh a few times.  Louise Fletcher has some small scenes on the farm as well, but to see her better, you should see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  George C. Scott plays a native american and I am not sure he pulls it off totally, but maybe he is half native american or something (they never say). But when George laughs in the movie, you cringe in your heart and you might even thank your lucky stars that George is not your uncle or father either !

The special effects show their age, but for no computer effects, it is pretty nice and poetic as the bad guys get their flaming body suits.  Again, if you like the special effects of Christine the movie, then you should be able to handle this movie.  The Pyro character in the X-Men movies has similar powers, but I grew up as the sci-fi special effects improved, so I can look past certain laws of physics being broken.  However, one scene has Drew Barrymore almost getting run over by a huge truck on fire and I am still not sure how they did that stunt.

The cast includes Drew Barrymore, David Keith, Heather Locklear, Martin Sheen (in a role that Burt Lancaster was to play), George C. Scott, Art Carney, and Louise Fletcher.  For the most part, this was not a problem, but can I picture George C. Scott playing a one eyed native American?  Wasn't there a good native American to play that role?

The story is more a true science fiction story than a horror story.  The government has secret experiments toying with paranormal activity.  Two of the guinea pigs fall in love, get married, and . . . no, they don't live happily ever after.  They have a daughter, and the government thugs kill the mother and try to kidnap the daughter, until the father intervenes.  There are no supernatural evil creatures; just people with abnormal abilities up against bad human beings.

218376,3,6300183459,"The book was absolutely brilliant.  I read it in 4 days. The movie rates only just better than average.  Despite her Hollywood lineage, Drew Barrymore just doesn't strike me as a very poignant actress.  E.T. and Charlie's Angels were her best flicks.  Throughout the movie, Drew seems to slur her speech.  She could have been high while performing since she did get hooked on drugs at a very early age.  In my opinion, someone else should have been chosen to play Charlie McGee.

Even though this movie was made in the 80s, it still could have done better visual effects-wise. Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, E.T. and Poltergeist came out the same period and were putting out some great supernatural feature films.  Firestarter is substandard compared to its blockbuster counterparts. Doesn't seem as if much of a budget was committed...nor a script for that matter.

Nonetheless, the director did what he could while David Keith, George C. Scott and Martin Sheen carried the drama of the film.  For the most part, the story turned out pretty decent.

This would fall right to the bottom of the Supernatural Movies pile, but it's still worth watching for entertainment value.  On the otherhand, the sequel, Firestarter 2, is just plain horrid depsite the snappier special effects.  Leave that one alone.

the year 1984, alot of the ""Big Brother"" theories were coming to life, meaning there were alot more authors writing stories about the secret factions of the United States Government. The Shop is the faction that Stephen King created, and the novel Firestarter takes you on the complete ride of what it feels like to have nowhere to hide. The movie is terrific, but in some parts I do feel like it may have been quickly knocked together, so they left out some important parts in the script. In the novel, Andy and Vicki McGee naively take part in a government experiment in college, but have no idea what they've gotten themselves into. The Shop is portrayed as diabolical, cold, and heartless. 'Either you be brainwashed, or you'll be exterminated. It's your choice.'
And THAT was what made it scary. Charlie and her power was not meant to be the frightening part at all (even though it is at times (: ) The frightening part is that a little girl is born into a situation in which there is no way out. So that's why I think that the movie and the book are underated by most critics.
But Firestarter is my all time favorite King book next to The Shining.",1033084800,16,1218,4.466367713004484
218381,4,6300183459,"Horror was starting to slide around the time this came out.  Bad slasher films seemed to reign supreme and the idea of Horror = low budget was in everyones mind.  However this title pulls all the stops and provides a highly entertaining, and suspensful thriller that only the mind of Stephen King could write.
This movie stars a very young Drew Barrymore in probably one of her top 5 best roles, and she was just a younun in this.  Her character is just overwhelmed with emotions and the development to include the frightening finally proves that this young kid (at the time) could act.
That's not to say the supporting cast was lousy, in fact it was also the backup power of Martin Sheen and George C Scott that made the movie even better.  Martin Sheen portrayed the diabolical Military Comandre and George C Scott as the cold and calculating John, the basic hired guns.  The first 30 minutes are Drew and her father trying to escape and the last hour is about the tests they perform and teh eventual carnage taht results.
I recomend this to anyone out there.  It is definetly worth the time and effort to see.",1022544000,,1112,4.535
218382,5,6300183459,"I have never forgotten this movie from the first time I saw it and I try to watch it from time to time and I always end enjoying it.  In the future, I will now take Jeff's opinion with a grain of salt, since he referred to this movie as laughable. Honestly, I love this movie and hope that this movie receives a better technical treatment on a future DVD release. This film is a classic whether jeffy boy wants to face it or not.",1019692800,4,429,4.047058823529412
