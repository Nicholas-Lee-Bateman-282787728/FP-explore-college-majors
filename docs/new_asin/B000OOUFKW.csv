8512772,5,B000OOUFKW,This is an old VHS tape that I received when it first came out from the best wife in the world. There is a stretching section and a strengthening section. Parts of the stretching can be done on the course before you play. (Some of them require you to lie down.) The strengthening section is about 45 minutes long. If you do the program 2 or 3 times a week you will see longer shots and more stability in your swing just like it says. I used to be a 14 handicap and got it to 9. When I have shown it to exercise professionals who focus on golf they are impressed. It used a golfer hooked up to sensors and a computer to identify the muscle groups involved in the swing and then they devised the strengthening program to develop those muscle groups.,1354060800,,747,4.194444444444445
