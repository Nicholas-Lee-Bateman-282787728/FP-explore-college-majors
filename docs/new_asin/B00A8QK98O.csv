8548426,1,B00A8QK98O,The worst video I have ever seen makes me not want to go on vacation in Hawaii. A waste of money to rent we put it on fast forward and still miserable watching it. DO NOT RENT IT!!,1458000000,,180,3.763157894736842
8548427,1,B00A8QK98O,A waste of time and money! Hawaiian words mispronounced; film quality is mediocre at best; and music is inappropriate! Junk!,1423526400,,124,5.25
8548428,1,B00A8QK98O,A waste of time and money! Virtually every Hawaiian word was mispronounced; film was mediocre at best; music was inappropriate! Junk!,1423526400,,133,5.380952380952381
8548429,5,B00A8QK98O,I had no trouble at all with this video. The colors in the photography were good and the audio was just fine on my copy. It had helpful info and provided a good historical overview of some key places on the Big Island.  It helped us plan our trip and see the things we wanted to see and avoid the things we weren't interested in seeing.,1388707200,,336,4.090909090909091
8548430,1,B00A8QK98O,"This was absolutley terrible!! The video  looked washed out and we never did get the audio part of it. I felt that I was really screwed on this one ! If I could get the rating system to kick in lower I would give it a minus 5 and made you pay me to watch this low budget rag! Dosen't anybody watch this stuff before trying to sell it to the public?? You should hang your head in shame for even having the gall to submit this type of junk on your site for consideration
