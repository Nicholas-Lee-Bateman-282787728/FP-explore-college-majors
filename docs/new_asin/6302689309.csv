7829193,5,6302689309,"Sunset plays a bad guy to catch the bad guys! Only this time, the bad guys think he is Billy the Kid. The one everyone thinks is the 'bad guy' is actually a pretty young woman and her ranch hands. Sunset Carson to the rescue.",1398902400,,225,4.022222222222222
7829194,1,6302689309,"It is obvious that producer Bennett Cohen is taken by his own storyline that is employed for this poorly-made film, since he utilizes it several times, notably in the 1932 RKO production COME ON, DANGER! that features Tom Keene as a Texas Ranger who feigns being a horse thief in order to ensnare the female leader (Julie Haydon) of an outlaw gang.  The Keene work benefits from ably performed musical numbers, but here a viewer is stuck with only monotoned monolith Sunset Carson at the film's center.  Carson is cast as Ranger Sunset Carson (easy for him to remember) who is determined to singlehandedly bring law and order to the region ""West of the Pecos"", and also to bring to justice the unknown murderer of a predecessor Ranger.  He begins his crusade by tracking a jail escapee whereupon he comes into contact with a young woman, played by Peggy Stewart, who heads a band of renegades, and he eventually confronts the leader of the Forces of Evil, performed by Roy Barcroft.  Screenwriter George Yates, nephew of Republic Studios head Herbert J., related to this reviewer his uncle's summation of Carson following a viewing by the senior Yates of one of his contract player's films, and while it is not printable in this forum, it remains a heartfelt reflection of despair over the failure of the 6' 6"" cowboy to manage even the most basic dialogue.  The handsome Carson ostensibly communicates some form of vulnerability to his primarily female fans who are willing to disregard his acting inability; additionally, it must be stated that he is an excellent horseman and, when in the saddle riding full tilt, he appears to be most capable, although perhaps not as entertaining as when he declaims his lines.  One of these latter from this film is of interest: when asked what his name might be, Carson coyly rejoinders ""Just call me Alias the Kid"", and this is the nearest reference to the movie's title within a slapdash script, as unrelated to the action as are a majority of the names of Carson featured pictures.  In reality, the entire effort is of inferior quality, including its poorly crafted and foolish scenario and, while considering a budgetary requirement for single takes, there are generally styleless performances turned in by many veteran players, as even Barcroft is dropping entire syllables, while the entire work is unfettered from any sort of pressure that might be applied by logic, or competent direction.",1153353600,,2437,4.900485436893204
7829195,3,6302689309,"It's the same story as in Buck Jones' ""The Texas Ranger"" (1931), Tom Keene's ""Come On, Danger"" (1932), George O'Brien's ""Renegade Ranger"" (1939) and Tim Holt's ""Come On, Danger!"" (1942) in which a lawman goes undercover to bring in a female bandit leader, only to find she's been forced into outlawry by a crooked tax collector and change sides. This time, Sunset Carson is the lawman, Peggy Stewart the lady outlaw and Roy Barcroft, the villain, an great trio from Republic Pictures -- although it has nothing whatever to do with Billy the Kid.",976492800,,545,4.808510638297872
