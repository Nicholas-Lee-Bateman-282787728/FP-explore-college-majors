8152988,5,B000JU7JEQ,I used this video after reading the story to my preschoolers.  They love the chance to expreince the book come to life.,1366243200,,119,4.409090909090909
8152989,5,B000JU7JEQ,"I am very pleased with this great DVD especially since it has great stories for children, and teachers, like me, can use it in the classroom.  It was a great buy!",1356048000,,162,4.225806451612903
8152990,4,B000JU7JEQ,"My children love to watch all the movies from this DVD.  It makes my children understand about a worm, loving toys, etc.",1314316800,,120,4.454545454545454
8152991,5,B000JU7JEQ,"I love all the stories here, as does my daughter.  If you don't want your kids to hear a sibling call her sister ""stupid"", then by all means, stay away.  But for the record, it was a really cute story.  My favorite was the three legged cat, though I see from other reviewers it's repeated on other dvds.  Generally, I just love most of these Weston Woods dvds, I don't have regular TV, and these are so much more tolerable to have on in the background than, say ""Dora, the explorer"".  Of course, I don't actually ""buy"" any of them.  Thank you New York Public Library!",1216684800,,567,4.30188679245283
8152992,2,B000JU7JEQ,"We have watched most of the DVDs in the Scholastic Video Collection.  This one was definately not one of the best.  I would not recommend buying it.  To my surprise, my daughter (4yo) did not even like the ""Diary of a Worm"", although she does like the book. I did like it. Anatole was also nice (we both liked it).  I Lost My Bear was THE WORST and NOT appropriate for little kids.  An annoying little girl with a very obnoxius sister... bad attitudes and the use of the word ""st*p*d"".  One thing I recommend before buying these movies: borrow them in the library or rent them first.  The extra movie (three legged cat) is in some of the other DVDs.",1188000000,11,649,4.31404958677686
8152993,5,B000JU7JEQ,"My 6 yo likes to follow along with the ""Diary of a Worm"" video with the book.  Antole is a pleasant story and serves as an example of how not to catagorize people (although Antole is a mouse).  Another winning DVD!",1179014400,,214,4.195121951219512
8152994,4,B000JU7JEQ,"My kids love the Schoolastic Video Series.  Diary of a Worm is our newest one.  Diary of a Worm itself is a funny and cute story narrated by Alexander Gould who was the voice of Nemo.  The next story is Anatole.  I don't think I've actually seen this one, I've heard it in the background several times.  As far as I can tell it's not bad.  Next is Frog Goes to Dinner.  It's a live action story without words.  Other than it's from the 70's it's not bad either.  After that it's I Lost My Bear.  Maybe it's okay when you're actually watching it, but when it's on in the background it's very annoying.  For some reason the sound plays a little louder and the girl narrating it is shrill and whinny.  Not my favorite, but it's my six year-old's favorite.  The bonus story is The Three-Legged Cat.  We have this story two other times already, but I don't mind.  It's a cute story and after hearing I Lost My Bear, it's nice and mellow.

The kids all like this one so I do too.  Also, a nice bonus is that it repeats, which can be helpful sometimes.",1178928000,7,1045,4.196969696969697
