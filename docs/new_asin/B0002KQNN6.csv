2100340,4,B0002KQNN6,"There is only one reason for watching this movie:  Miranda Otto's performance.  This is the only movie in which she is the star, and she makes the most of it.  The film shows her growing from a fragile, angry, emotionally devastated wife-mother into a strong, loving and sympathetic woman, what her Jewish husband might call a ""mensch.""  Her love scene with the unlikely Lothaire Bluteau (as a Christ-like healer, the only living virgin in the former USSR) is the emotional climax, literally, of the movie.  The ending is just right, especially if you've been paying attention to the signs along the way.  You can clearly see the trajectories of each of the lives in what has gone before.",1107216000,3,688,4.788135593220339
2100341,1,B0002KQNN6,"I want the last 113 minutes of my life back.  This was like a Lifetime Original Movie, only without the plot, and with the worst dialogue ever.",1106265600,3,143,4.296296296296297
2100342,5,B0002KQNN6,"This is a story with a very humanistic empathy, that emanates from all the actors.  The director does a marvelous job letting us see the complexity and sometimes the kaos of the human experience.  I would agree with an earlier reviewer who said,

""Miranda Otto delivers a powerful performance that takes the viewer on a voyage through hope and despair, love and hate, ecstasy and torment. The story is powerful when it is viewed as one that it is about healing, not about curing.""  The acting is superb and the subject matter intense.  Don't miss this film. Do be aware of the adult content. It should probably not be viewed by those under 18.

2100343,5,B0002KQNN6,"A film that surprises with every turn. Every time we set into an estabilished genra the film shifts, led by an amazing cast with an extraordinary Miranda Otto in command. It is real and profound and sad and hopefull. I think it can touch people in a deep place, where not a lot of films dare to look. Real pain and loss and real courage. I don't want to say to much about the story of this woman looking to find her peace and her home, but it's something I will recomend highly!!! Buy it, watch it!!!",1102291200,3,500,4.164948453608248
2100344,4,B0002KQNN6,"While I agree with the comments from the previous reviewer that the plot took a less exciting turn than may have been hoped once Julie (Miranda Otto) returns from Poland after having taken her son to be seen by a healer, the film is nevertheless a powerful exposition of human emotion.  Miranda Otto delivers a powerful performance that takes the viewer on a voyage through hope and despair, love and hate, ecstasy and torment.  The story is powerful when it is viewed as one that it is about healing, not about curing.  Julie is more in need of healing than anyone in the story and only through her experience with Alexi is she able to return to be the woman she was before being injured by the infidelity of her common-law husband and the discovery of her young son's terminal cancer.  Julie is deeply wounded and only through the profound experiential healing which she finds in Alexi is she able to achieve the healing which she is both unable and unwilling to uncover in the lives of those around her whom she injures on account of her dis-ease.  While it may seem to be central, her son's illness is merely the catalyst that destoys who Julie is that allows her to be remade as a whole person through her healing.  The film also unveils some of the beauty of Poland, a nation rarely shown on film.  Lastly, the way that faith is handled in the film is also rather profound--it is shown as something which is both powerful and dangerous; something that has amazing potential when tapped and at the same time an incredible destabilizing force.  This sense is heightened by the subtle but evocative score in the film.",1101945600,5,1620,4.581314878892734
2100345,1,B0002KQNN6,"The phrase ""Shaggy Dog Story"" applies here--an annoyingly long story with an ugly payoff.  The premise of this film is interesting: a woman with an ill son takes him to a faith healer and has her faith in life renewed.  Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere after this--it was almost as though the project ran out of money and they had to tack on a quick ending.  What a letdown.  Nice acting from Miranda Otto and William Fitchner, but at the end, my wife and I sat up simultaneously and said ""What?!""",1100908800,5,501,4.472527472527473
2100356,2,B0002KQNN6,"The Healer sounds great on the box but trust me, it's a powerful letdown. There are also apparently several versions of it out there under more than one title (Julie Walking Home being another name for the same film). The version I saw was widescreen instead of letterbox and was inexplicably shorn of the nudity and cussing I later found was scattered throughout the uncut movie, which was kind of a rip, I think.

This film, The Healer, begins with all the lackluster banality of a movie-of-the-week style human interest story regarding adultery and its aftermath, evolves into a pathos-seeking tale of the toll a terminally sick child takes on his Canadian family, then slides sideways to find what seems its main focus as a story about a supernatural healer making his rounds among the infirm of distant Poland. After this is accomplished and just as the plot seems to flirt with meaning, The Healer then falls apart with total finality as it becomes mired in its final act, namely scenes from a love affair between the European-born healer and the mother of the  dangerously ill little boy he has either healer or not healed.

The Healer had some watchable actors, especially the radiantly beautiful Miranda Otto, and good locations, but it lacked a true plot and would often go off in puzzlingly irrelevant directions that were annoyingly frustrating. Characters were introduced and then dropped, storylines dangled and went nowhere, and some developments amounted to what mystery writers used to call ""red herrings."" And the ending...oh my gosh, what ending? This movie doesn't come with a conclusion, just a sudden cessation that stuns with its alacrity and absence of closure. Ultimately The Healer answers no questions, resolves absolutely nothing about its characters or their situations, their futures or the outcome to anything that was introduced earlier in its 114-minute run-time. It departs with an abruptness that amounts to amateurish rudeness.

So what is this chaotic movie about? I've seen it and I admit, I really I have no idea.",1207094400,,2052,5.04424778761062
2100357,3,B0002KQNN6,"Please read the other reviews on this if you are considering buying this dvd. Depending on what you want it for it might be unnecessary to buy it since it is being shown on tv these days: I saw it on LMN today.

All the actors are what makes it brilliant: Miranda Otto is radiant and warm in this changing role of wife, mother, lover, Lothair Bluteau as Alexei the healer is translucent in his role of someone who surrenders to something bigger than himself.

Spiritual healing is what makes it moving. Stories about the spiritual world are being covered more and more these days, happily so for those of us who look for them. Miranda's character Julie has no religious beliefs but her favorite song is ""Wayfaring Stranger"" which is about dying and going ""over Jordan,"" symbolic for Heaven. That was a nice touch in showing her blossoming awareness, which makes me think the original screenplay was better than the movie turned out.

Unfinished? As others here have said, I think the disappointing part was that the movie stopped abruptly, with a tacked on scene of Julie and husband seemingly reunited when just minutes earlier she and Alexei were in love and expecting a baby. I blinked and the movie was over. I think if you know this in advance you could watch the movie with less need for it to make sense and more appreciation for the subject matter.",1199577600,,1356,4.618257261410788
2100358,1,B0002KQNN6,"I was waiting for the ""To Be Continued"" sign to come up at the end of this movie. Where did the Healer go to? Are the parents lovey dovey again, which is the impression they leave you with? What about the Healer's baby? Did he just walk out on it? I think that 1 star is too high a rating for this disjointed movie.",1199577600,,315,3.9375
2100359,5,B0002KQNN6,"The film THE HEALER (a.k.a. ""Julie Walking Home"") poses the kind of unsettling metaphysical questions that many prefer to avoid asking.  At the same time, it suggests some intriguing answers. Like the film THE CRIME OF PADRE AMARO (please see companion review) the movie ""The Healer"" is a study of the degrees to which human beings can enjoy the gift of human sexuality while simultaneously attempting to serve as channels for spiritual healing, social harmony, and political integrity. That Alexei--played flawlessly by Lothaire Bluteau--is a true and gifted spiritual healer becomes clear from the outset. We witness him as a child in a hospital where doctors discover that standing him on the back of an ailing patient relieves the patient's pain. Moreover, his very presence apparently has a healing impact on every patient in the ward. As an adult, Alexei becomes famous as a healer who shares his gifts freely with the world. But like the proverbial prophet without honor in his own hometown, he has to endure the complaints of an aging mother who points out that not only is his spiritual generosity towards the world doing nothing to alleviate her financial distress but it is perhaps not the best way to prepare for his own latter years.

Much of ""The Healer"" actually centers around the rift that occurs in the life of the Makowskys, a Canadian family whose happiness is torn asunder when the husband--played with superb complexity by William Fichtner--has an affair, and the young son develops cancer. Is the child's disease a physical manifestation of the family's spiritual dis-ease following the father's adultery? Good question to ponder.

In her desperation to save their son, the mother--exemplary work here by Miranda Otto--seeks out the assistance of the healer Alexei. From their very first meeting, the attraction between them is clearly both spiritual and sexual.  The child is indeed healed and all returns uneasily to their separate lives. Then Alexei visits the mother and the two have an affair. Their sexual union seems to rob the healer of his ability to help the little boy when his cancer returns. However, ironically, it also results in a pregnancy. Is this a bad thing or a good thing for the family and the healer? Pay close attention to the end and see what you think.

2100360,2,B0002KQNN6,"There is some really good acting by all the cast which is why it deserved the two stars.  As another reviewer stated, the plot threads are left unresolved and the ending seemed kind of like someone said, ""ok, here's the two hour mark.  Wrap it up.""  I did like that they were starting to explore the issue of religious and spiritual beliefs, but they dropped it pretty quickly.  How does the healing of her child effect the mother's own spiritual belief system?  Dunno.  It was like, kid healed, end of story.(not end of movie--I didn't spoil the ending).  Mother has affair with healer and then poof, he's gone.  Why?  Where'd he go?  What's he up to now?  How did this affair effect him after he went back to his country?  Dunno.

2100361,3,B0002KQNN6,"STATESIDE is an adventurous romantic drama about a high-school rich kid serving in the Marine Corps to avoid jail, and a schizophrenic actress, whose career is crashing. Based on a true story, STATESIDE follows Mark Deloach (Jonathan Tucker), who lands in the Marine Corps and meets Dori Lawrence (Rachael Leigh Cook) before shipping out. Mark and Dori are a perfect match of misfits introduced by a friend Sue Dubois (Agnes Bruckner), whose mother (Carrie Fisher), is suing Mark. Dori has left the bright lights of Hollywood to fix her life and mental illness. At boot camp, Drill Instructor Skeer (Val Kilmer) is on a mission not only to train, but to make a man out of the rebellious teenager. The two outcast lovers, with more than a dose of humor, cling to their romance in spite of the obstacles from authorities and circumstances which stand in their way.

You'll root for the two quirky, young heroes in this film about proud mothers, fighting peoples, first love, and war across the sea.",1122854400,,996,4.824561403508772

then you don't want to see this movie., because its truly

to be a HEALER ,God bless the people in Poland.  Where some of this movie was produced. Academy award director Agnieszka Holland",1113264000,3,316,4.553571428571429
2100363,3,B0002KQNN6,"""The Healer"" is the Australian television name for an independent film (a joint Canadian-Polish production) that was originally entitled ""Julie Walking Home.""  Knowing both titles for this 2002 film, and the interesting combination of nations the production represents, is key because it really is two different movies thrown together with some degree of success.  I checked it out because I wanted to see Miranda Otto in it (big  &Eacute;owyn fan) and knew absolutely nothing about it (my assumption was that she would be the title character since her face is the only one on the cover, but that proves not to be the case).

After the prologue in which we since the healer first being a healer, ""Julie Walking Home"" would describe the first act of this film from director Agnieszka Holland (""Washington Square"").  Julie Makowsky (Miranda Otto) comes home early from a trip with her eight-year-old twins, Nick (Ryan Smith) and Nicole (Bianca Crudo), and gets an unpleasant surprise from her husband, Henry (Willaim Fichtner).  Her response is to take the kids and leave immediately, but they are in the back of the car screaming about daddy running after them and one of the twins gets out.  As far as Julie is concerned her marriage is over and I was intrigued by the notion of a pair of twins, who are closer than most twins, torn apart by a divorce.  But that is not with this film is about because before the family can break apart one of the twins gets sick.

The doctors say there is no hope and from a most unexpected source Julie hears about Alexei the healer (Lothair Bluteau), a Russian who is laying hands on the sick and dying in Poland.  So she packs up her dying child over her husband's objections and heads to Europe.  Once there, Alexei picks her out of the crowd and puts his hands on her child.  ""The Healer"" second act of this film is potentially interesting: you find yourself wondering what happened to Alexei over the years between the boy we saw in the prologue and the man he is now.  But the focus of the movie suddenly shifts to the attraction between Alexei and Julie and suddenly this film is a romance.

Now we have a third movie, which, again, is potentially interesting.  Julie has already proven she will do anything to save her child, so what must she think about Alexei's attention?  Throw into this the fact that Julie is on the rebound from her marriage and has been critical of religion, and the complex emotions with which she is dealing seem rather overwhelming.  Indeed, Otto's performance is the centerpiece of this film, but the script, by Holland along with Roman Gren and Arlene Sarner puts her through too much in the last act.  When Julie makes love to Alexei it is hard to tell if she is really in love or just extremely grateful.  Those who check out ""The Healer"" because of Otto will not be disappointed by her performance, but they will feel unsatisfied by how all the plot threads are resolved in by the finish.  There are the bits and pieces of a couple of good films here, but the mix does not match.",1110240000,17,3054,4.609981515711645
2100364,1,B0002KQNN6,"Give this one a miss. It was terrible. It had no point at all. I'm a huge fan of the LOTR Trilogy, so I figured I'd give it a shot since Miranda Otto (who plays Eowyn in LOTR) was in it. What a waste of time! The person who said they want those ""113 minutes of their life back"" is dead right.

Sure, it may be realistic in the beginning, but this is a prime example of one of the things that drives me crazy about indy movies. They get too pretentious when they try to be so character driven, and spend too much time giving us information we really don't need to know.

It could have been much more magical, but it gives us a boring ending--not to mention it drags on for ages before anything happens. The cast itself was really blah. Eowyn (hehe) is good, playing the sympathic mother role. But after that, well. That's about it. If you have to see it, rent it before you buy it. It's definitely not worth the cost of purchasing it new.",1109721600,7,937,4.142857142857143
2100365,4,B0002KQNN6,"I fell in love with Miranda Otto in Danny Deck Chair and will watch her in anything.

This movie was, at times, a little all over the place, but definitely worth watching for all of the performances, especially Otto's and the child actors.

Otto gives a gripping peformance as a mother willing to do anything to save her child's life, even when no one else believes what she's doing is right.

Lothaire Bluteau as Aleksi is terrific in a fairly brief, but important role.

The film touches on ideas of faith versus science, but doesn't explore them fully.  Still, there are highly charged performances from everyone involved and The Healer is a highly watchable film.",1108339200,4,667,4.765217391304348

 Guess it's not one of those movies typically marketed to you. It's one of the few movies I have seen where no matter what is going on, you just feel like a fly on the wall, it's just so real, at once you are engaged, feel close to all the characters, and it's more of an experience than it is a intellectual viewing of it.  I like the characters, with all their flaws, they don't bother me, as if they were somehow family members I have never met.  It's has unique content, storyline, dialog, characters, a step out of the box.  It's a love story, too, and one of the few ""lovemaking"" scenes I have seen, where the acting is so natural, innocent, very honest.  We are not embarassed, or sickened by their crudeness, either.

8028424,5,B0002KQNN6,"The story draws in the viewer slowly and craftily, one subplot at a time, like fingers that eventually become the hand that grabs full hold of you. First there is the family, a married couple with twins, one girl and one boy, who sometimes have their own peculiar words and rituals. Miranda Otto and William Fichtner are believable as unique individuals as are the child actors, providing interest as none of the characters appear to draw on any of the usual cliches. Otto (Julie) is beautiful in a human way, making her beauty and character all the more dramatically appealing. Fichtner is also down-to-earth, real and dimensional; not your typical film husband. There is his affair, revealed to the viewer in the same unexpected, shocking way as it is to Julie. There is the splitting of the family. The father that Julie stays with in his last hurrah, December romance with a Polish mail order bride. And of course there is the cancer that Julie's son is suddenly beset with. And what you are left with is Julie and her son travelling to Poland to meet the healer, the mysterious man the Polish woman has spoken of.

  Julie is vulnerable both as a mother and as a betrayed wife. The healer, masterfully played by Lothaire Blutheau, is a strangely beautiful brand of innocence. Not fair but dark eyed and dark haired; not priestly but in ragged clothes, not childish but not initiated. His smiles, his healing hands, his every whim is guided by a force other than his conscious will. And he is guided to Julie's child, Nicholas (played by Ryan Smith). It is an almost magical journey for Julie and Nicholas; the kind of magic that might guide a blind man to see. And the healing works on an ailing Nicholas. There also feels to be some sort of magic working on Julie and the healer, Alexy. It is innocent and pure, and altogether explosively sexually charged. The sex scene they give us is unlike any we've seen before or will again. Julie's husband, feeling but not able to intellectually suspect something, tells Julie she feels different. And she explains that Alexy is ""so different"" but that she cannot put it into words. The ""different"" feeling is that of the unexpressed sexuality between herself and Alexy, and the viewer can feel this unique blend of chemistry, this mysterious and seductive energy that Julie cannot describe. And soon Alexy, who has spent his entire life nearly an androgyne, sexless and without any inkling of desire for a woman, will feel the full force of this energy and will succumb to it. Julie becomes pregnant by him and Nicholas' condition takes a turn for the worse. Then, the whole movie as it works it way to the finale takes a turn that is not quite accessible.

It almost merits taking off a star, but who could do that, with such fine film making and acting? What kind of film deserves five stars if this does not, a film rife with cliches, handsome princes, heists and cold, posed sex scenes? No; it is a film like this one, with the performance of Lothaire Bluteau and Miranda Otto that seems to deliver the essence of the characters' very souls to the viewer. The rest of the cast also offers phenomenal support, even in the small parts. There is a piquant and simple score that is enacted just so as to capture the different notes played upon in the film. The writing and script are clever enough without drawing unnecessary attention to themselves. It is worthy of five stars, but you'll be left wondering if the loose ends were tied or whether they simply unraveled.",1377302400,,3517,4.658615136876007

Julie and Henry's relationship troubles, together with their son's illness and the family's struggle to define itself both spiritually and emotionally, make the movie very moving. It's about trust and forgiveness as much as it's about faith. Alexy is a sweet weirdo, vulnerable and lonely, trying to work out his own issues and the sudden, earth-shattering presence of Julie in his life. His side of the plot was left very unresolved.
