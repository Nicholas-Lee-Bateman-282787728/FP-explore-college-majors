2516690,5,B000EDWLT6,"This is one of the absolute best releases ever.  I'm so happy it is finally being released.  I'm also watching carefully--many excellent British offerings from Mystery and Masterpiece Theatre are being released.

Don't miss out on this hilarious romp!",1140739200,3,251,5.384615384615385
2516691,5,B000EDWLT6,"I have been waiting for this to be released for ages.  I remember this series from when it was originally broadcast in 1981.  It has stuck with me all those years.  At the center of the story are 2 people brought together out of necessity.  He needs money, she needs a husband.  Through it all you see the events of the early 20th century as their struggling silent film company tries to make it big.  Comedy, romance, drama, suspense, history, this one has it all.  From the good old days of Masterpiece Theater -- Brideshead Revisited, Jewel in the Crown, Edward and Mrs. Simpson, Danger UXB.  Wonderful Stuff.",1140652800,3,612,4.601851851851852
2516702,5,B000EDWLT6,"I was fascinated by this movie when it was first shown on Masterpiece Theatre many years ago and several times wished I could see it again.  When it was offered on DVD I immediately ordered it and it was just as much fun to watch the second time.  This stars two of my favorites, Bob Hoskins and Frances de la Tour along with lots of other lovable characters.  This takes place in the early years of silent film making.  Arnie Cole (Hoskins) tries to break into this business without enough capital while dealing with actors and actresses with big egos.  There is a surprising love interest that develops.",1168473600,5,605,4.564814814814815
2516703,5,B000EDWLT6,"THe supplier had warn me that the deliver might take up to eight weeks,  but the delivery was slower than I had expected it to be.",1156550400,,130,4.0
2516704,5,B000EDWLT6,"Produced in 1980 and penned by britcom veteran Roy Clarke (Keeping Up Appearances, Last of the Summer Wine, Open All Hours), Flickers is a light, entertaining six-part comedy-drama (with the emphasis on comedy) set amid the burgeoning film industry in 1920's England.

The series stars Bob Hoskins (Mrs. Henderson Presents, Thick as Thieves) as Arnie Cole, an outspoken Cockney with little dress sense and even less manners;  yet despite his faults, he is shrewd, determined and hard-working.  Arnie is in the business of showing films, but what he really wants to do is make them.  He's a man with a dream--a vision, even; what he lacks, however, is money.  The need for a loan or a backer poses a huge obstacle in a time when the more conservative, traditional lenders and investors were very leary of putting money into what was viewed by many as likely being a here-today-gone-tomorrow industry.

Frances de la Tour (Rising Damp) stars as Maud, the well-spoken, well-bred, but very uppity, not to mention plain-looking, daughter of a well-off family.  It is Maud's brother, Clive, who himself has a tidy nest-egg, that Arnie hopes to smooth-talk into investing in his dream.  Maud, however, sees right through Arnie, and turns him down flat.

As it happens, circumstances conspire to bring Arnie and Maud together.  Theirs is an uncomfortable, not to mention unlikely, alliance--at least initially; and it is an uphill battle all the way, with shoe-string finances being only the tip of the problem.  From a Shirley-Temple-like little girl who's becoming noticeably not so little anymore to a depressive comic and a grand, self-obsessed theatrical diva, there are a number of temperamental, highly-strung thespians, whose egos must be placated.  Then there is Max Legendre, the agent of the big-name comic star whom Arnie hopes to snag.  The problem is that Max, who has no people skills whatsoever and is no more than a temperamental bully, has aspirations in the directorial direction; that he gets his way only adds to Arnie and Maud's problems.  Circumstances are not assisted by the reappearance of Letty, Arnie's tarty (but certainly not plain) former flame, who kindles a spark of jealousy in Maud.

With 50-minute episodes, romantic tension, a delightful blend of comedy and drama, and an unusual period setting, this series is quite a departure for Roy Clarke (who also displayed a flair for comedy-drama in the feature-length film Hawks).  Viewers ought not, therefore, to expect something akin to the above-mentioned character comedies for which Clarke is so well known.  Though characters abound, this is not character comedy.  It really is in a class all its own--I can think of nothing to which to compare it!  Having said that, it is a well-written, superbly-acted series with an engaging storyline, and it is a series our family really enjoyed.",1149638400,23,2864,5.094218415417559
2516705,5,B000EDWLT6,"I saw this when it was on Masterpiece Theater, and enjoyed it then.  It's even better than I remembered it - watched the last 4 episodes in one sitting.  Not too many films are that enjoyable!  Well worth the money.",1148688000,9,215,4.325
2516706,5,B000EDWLT6,"Sitting in the doctor's office yesterday, I got into a conversation about movies. When the topic of favorite shows came up, I mentioned ""Flickers"" as my all-time favorite series. To check the date (and show off my neat PDA), I got onto the internet and discovered that after 25 years this show had FINALLY been issued in April! Vy vas I not informed!

I placed my order on Amazon tonight, even though I am a Netflix subscriber. This is a keeper. Plus I get to toss my old off-the-air VHS tape.

No need to rehash the plot as it's been well described by others. I guarantee that anyone who ever enjoyed a Britcom will love this, as will anyone who likes a totally pleasant, funny, warm, off-beat love story. Or likes Bob Hoskins. It will make you a Frances De La Tour fan as well, though she has has few entries in her filmography; her latest role is the giantess Madam Maxime in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" I almost plotzed* when I saw her!

Buy it!

2516707,5,B000EDWLT6,"Discovering that Flickers is available on DVD was the high point of the day.  Just the day before my friends were lamenting that this wonderful series had never been made available to the public.  It was my first introduction to that wonderful actor Bob Hoskins, although the entire cast was wonderful.

This is one of the best blends of sheer comedy combined with touching romance as two totally mismatched people forced together by circumstances learn to cherish each other. Don't miss this one.",1146182400,9,497,4.963855421686747
2516708,5,B000EDWLT6,"I have been in love with this off-beat, quirky and passionate story since it first aired on Great Performances 26 years ago.  I have waited patiently all this time for it's release and finally here it is.  It should delight a whole new generation of viewers, and thrill it's long-time fans.  Look for the little silent moments between characters for pure magic!",1145836800,8,361,4.790322580645161
2516709,5,B000EDWLT6,"Hoskins and De La Tour - a classic, hilarious pairing of two superb actors.  Loved the story, loved Arnie, loved Maude.  When my DVD arrives I'm having a Flickers marathon party, it will be champagne and snacky things, a comfy seat and my eyes will be glued to the screen.  I guarantee I won't be able to stop myself watching the whole darn thing from start to finish.

2516710,5,B000EDWLT6,"i'm thrilled to finally be able to see this series again. everything about it is first rate--the story, the performances, the dialogue, the sets, the costumes, everything is wonderful. i never understood why it wasn't released on tape, but, at long, long last, it has been released.

if you admire great acting, watch this series, then watch the movie 'the long good friday.' bob hoskins will amaze you--his range is fantastic.

the rest of this cast is also superb. frances de la tour's comic timing is a joy to watch.

if you didn't see it on pbs, buy, rent, steal the dvd's. you'll be in for a real treat.",1141344000,11,608,4.559633027522936
2516711,5,B000EDWLT6,"Yippee! I couldn't be happier! Considering the fact that ""Flickers"" never even got a VHS release, many of us have been waiting 15 years to once again see this fantastic mini series ~ quite the best of all of the Roy Clarke offerings, in my opinion. The role of Arney Cole could have been written for Bob Hoskins, and the excellent Frances de la Tour, playing Maude, shows us just how beautiful a plain woman can be.",1140825600,3,415,4.402597402597403
8108537,4,B000EDWLT6,"Low-budgeted, mediocre sets, but these are way overshadowed by the story and the wonderful acting by Hospkins and De la Tour. Definitely a worthy addition to anyone's collection of films by these actors.",1521417600,,203,5.181818181818182
8108538,5,B000EDWLT6,"This delightful BBC comedy/melodrama series from 1980 about the early silent movie industry in Britain features excellent performances by leads Bob Hoskins (who earlier starred in  the classic Dennis Potter series Pennies from Heaven) and Frances de la Tour (many will remember her as Madame Olympe Maxime in a couple of the Harry Potter films,) and a clever, intelligent, and often very funny script. Though unjustly neglected nowadays, I think this is a series that most viewers will find engaging and entertaining.  The only flaw is that the scenes often have the ""stagy"" atmosphere characteristic  of  older TV drama, but one soon gets used to that.  The 3 disc DVD set is of very good visual and audio quality; apparently it is out of print: as of this writing, the only copies offered on Amazon are extremely expensive.",1441324800,,825,4.949275362318841
8108539,5,B000EDWLT6,"Superb.  How I ""discovered"" Bob Hoskins.  As my British friend called. him ""A Cockney teddy bear.""  His passing was a sad event.",1435449600,,128,4.7272727272727275
8108540,4,B000EDWLT6,"I was delighted to find this series available on dvd.  All I had was a very poor home-recorded version on vhs.  It tells a charming story of a cockney named Arnie Cole, who is struggling to make it in the early days of moving pictures.  He makes a little money renting films for showing (and sometimes unethically re-renting them to other folks), but he dreams of the big profits possible for those who can make their own films.  He gets his chance in an unexpected way.  Then he struggles with the problems of dealing with directors, and actors, and the switch to talkies.  I only gave it four stars because it seriously needs captions.  The cockney accents, not to mention the speech of Arnie's ""tame Welchman"" projector mechanic, are just too thick for American ears.",1410307200,,770,4.659259259259259
8108541,5,B000EDWLT6,"I watched this decades ago on my tiny black and white tv. Id already been interested in silents and found this show interesting, hilarious and moving. Hoskins and de la Tour were briliant and there were several scenes that have stayed with me over the years. Well, I happened to think about it and was curious if it was still available - and there it was! Just finished the rewatch, and it was even better than I remembered (it helped to be a few years older with a more adult perpective :)  The acting is superb and the story entertaining and intelligent.

The only problem I had with it were the accents - they do take a bit of getting used to. Other than that, I highly recommend viewing!",1404604800,4,691,4.348837209302325
8108542,5,B000EDWLT6,One of the funniest series ever. One suggestion: it occasionally needs subtitles because of Hoskins' Cockney accent and one other character's Welsh accent. Otherwise listen closely.,1383696000,,181,6.0
8108543,3,B000EDWLT6,"I saw this short series years ago on TV and loved it. The dvd set is the only way to watch this story, since it jumps around with characters and plots that may never be resolved and I really had to keep in mind who the characters were and what the two movies being made were about.

The actors are wonderful and the sets interesting. I liked the interruptions with the ""signs"" made for silent films, but I thought there were too many and took up a lot of time between pieces of the rather confusing arrangement of stories being told. I still feel as though ""things"" were left out and am not clear as to what happened to some characters. The real/main story of Arnie and Maud was simple, fun, interesting, and I enjoyed its continuing plot to the end. Other characters were well played, but I'd rather have seen more plot than signage.

The other wonderful descriptions of this movie aren't ""wrong."" I just found myself wanting more continuity and less confusion.

This is not a film for everyone. You have to like the history of silent filmmaking, which I do. Others may be bored or find it ""dull."" It is not actually funny, but humorous.

I think I'm being fair with a rating of 3 stars. I am a bit surprised that everyone else thinks it was so funny. I wouldn't compare it to a typical Britcom, and I don't mean Benny Hill but a more ""drama'ish"" comedy.

I did find some small sound problem with the second of the three dvds. And, I thought there would be more to the story than there is. I saw the entire 3 discs in one sitting. I think it was the second disc that had only 1 episode and half of another. I just wasn't as satisfied with what I remembered as I should have been. I doubt if I will ever watch this again, and that tells you something. Of course, I seem to be the only one who didn't think it was terrific, but....",1380412800,,1830,4.262247838616715
8108544,3,B000EDWLT6,"The wife loved it. I enjoy Hoskins in small doses, so I will not watch it on three consecutive nights (two episodes per night) as she did. I feel some series have to be digested more slowly.",1358035200,,190,4.162162162162162
8108545,5,B000EDWLT6,"Wonderful performances from the two main characters -Bob Hoskins ('The Long Good Friday') and Frances de la Tour ('Rising Damp')- who are in a marriage of convenience (he has the talent, but she has the money, well initially!) during the early days of cinema.",1329782400,2,259,4.909090909090909
8108546,5,B000EDWLT6,"This is one of, if not THE, absolutely funniest things I've ever seen!  The only thing that might be close to matching it would be Michael Frayn's ""Noises Off.""  Now I must check if that's on video!",1327017600,,198,4.324324324324325
