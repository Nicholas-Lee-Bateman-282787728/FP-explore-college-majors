8247731,4,B0012SY0B4,"THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY is adapted from an 1863 Edward Everett Hale short story.

In it, Army lieutenant Philip Nolan (Herbert) is tried in 1807 as part of a treason conspiracy (the Aaron Burr scandal). His fate is sealed in court when an angry Nolan curses the USA, saying he hopes to never hear of the country again. Once a conviction is obtained, the trial judge acts on Nolan's ill-advised outburst and orders that he be held in the brigs of various Navy warships, a disenfranchised man with no place to call home and no knowledge of the land of his birth.

""Man Without a Country"" has been remade three times since 1917, including as a 1937 Oscar-nominated Technicolor WARNER BROS. short starring John Litel. This 1917 edition was produced by pioneer THANHOUSER FILM CORPORATION of Portland, OR.
