8470890,2,B00008G95Y,"With the other good reviews, I had high expectations. I thought this whole movie was weak.  They replay multiple of the same fights over and over just with a different soundtrack. If you've never seen a real fight in your life then this may appeal to you. These are mainly scuffles more than brawls.  Everyone is so tangled together all the time no one can even throw a punch.  There may be one or two ""decent fights"" and that's it.  Even those fights are usually one sided.  One guy chasing another around the parking lot.  If you must buy this movie, DO NOT SPEND 40 DOLLARS ON THIS! ITS OUTRAGEOUS THAT THEY COULD CHARGE THIS!  I WOULDN'T PAY MORE THAN 5 DOLLARS!",1332288000,,666,4.409836065573771
8470891,4,B00008G95Y,Frat boys beating the crap out of one another. I like watching idiots fight. I wish it was more in focus and they would look the the view finder when they were shooting it but hey who cares bring on the blood.,1137888000,,209,4.0
8470892,5,B00008G95Y,I have fighting mad and this dvd. This is an excellent one to ad to your collection. I love to watch it over and over. Just like fighting mad this dvd gives you a kick ass soundtrack and some great footage. Two fights in particular are very entertaining. This DVD is all drunken mayhem at it's best. The dvd also has previews for fighting mad and another dvd called Fights. So you get about 15 minutes of bonus footage. All in all a great purchase.,1066608000,,448,4.2823529411764705
