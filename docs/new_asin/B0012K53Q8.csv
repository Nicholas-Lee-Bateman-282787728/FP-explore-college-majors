8246324,3,B0012K53Q8,"Poor Picture quality gets 1 1/2 stars ~ Overall run time 191 mins ~ Keepcase ~ Comes with an Alpha video dvd booklet insert
Deadly Drifter  ~  1 1/2 stars ~  Run time 91 mins
Violent Professionals ~ 5 stars ~ Run time 100 mins Great movie, poor picture, a hideous green horizontal line on the right side of the screen early on (fades after a minute or so) makes it clear that this film needs remastering badly. I know there is a rather expensive dvd version of this available same listed run time, same widescreen, (yes this is a widescreen version here the ratio is 1:88/1 or close to it.) Same picture I assume, the only difference is that it is alone with a cool looking artwork cover.
Overall:  3  stars  worth buying for Violent Professionals poor picture et all",1283558400,3,767,4.404255319148936
