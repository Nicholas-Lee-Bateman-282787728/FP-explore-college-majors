5859257,5,B00DV6Y6G4,"This film is pretty remarkable. On the surface it seems simple, yet somehow the director managed to explore depth through various aspects of Fonseca's life. The content ranges from Fonsecas moving life story, to the theory and process of painting itself, to the quiet life of an artist in his Italian studio and the thoughts and process of one fascinating individual as he grows with and engages Art as a practice and an idea. Though the film focuses on the very specific frame of one artists life, it presents universal themes and questions that apply to the life of any Human. It will make anyone think and feel (I'm not an visual artist, and it got me). Best of all, the film captures the tone of Fonsecas work and becomes a piece of art in itself. Highly recommended to anyone with a brain and heart.",1397001600,2,804,4.551724137931035
5859258,4,B00DV6Y6G4,"If you have more than a passing interest in art and in particular painting, this film will be of interest to you.  A good look into the life of a professional artist although not comprehensive.  It does present a fair view, if only a small slice, of how one artist approaches his work and how he works on a daily basis.",1377734400,2,319,4.213114754098361
5859259,5,B00DV6Y6G4,Beautiful thoughtful film that really explores what it means to be an artist today amid a crazy contemporary scene when you still believe in craft and tradition and yet want to question the very basics of form. I recommend to anyone who wants to see what the life of a painter can be.,1377561600,2,284,4.377358490566038

I immediately added some Moises Fernandez to my classical music collection, needless to say, not only was the soundtrack appropriate, but the fact that Fonseca performed it made the experience that much more intimate.",1464825600,,292,5.23404255319149
