8603954,5,B00ECU4LIG,"I've never seen the second film, Opus n' Bill in a Wish for Wings That Work, but The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus is a movie my best friend and I have been hunting down for ages, it is one of our favorites, and even my nephew now likes the movie. It follows the life of Claus from being found as a baby but mythical creatures, to how he became Santa and the challenges he faced. It is a joyful movie with some comical characters for the family and I highly recommend it for anyone with children, or even anyone who is still a child at heart.",1463788800,2,547,4.074074074074074

8603956,5,B00ECU4LIG,I've had this on VHS from the early 90's and the tape is almost worn out.  So I was SO happy to see it for so cheap along with another Christmas tale.  I love Opus and his Christmas story is great for all ages.,1455580800,,210,3.75
8603957,5,B00ECU4LIG,"I had been a fan of ""Bloom County"" way back when and we actually had ""A Wish for Wings That Work"" on VHS.  It is an odd but delightful Christmas tale and one we watched annually until we retired the VHS machine.  Well, Berkeley Breathed just brought ""Bloom County"" back!  I was feeling some nostalgia and am very happy to find this gem and really cannot wait to watch it.  If you are a ""Bloom County"" fan, this is a must by.  If you never hear of ""Bloom County"", search Berkeley Breathed on Facebook and join the legion.  Welcome back, Opus, you have been missed",1439510400,4,562,4.304761904761905
