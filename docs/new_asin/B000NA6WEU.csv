8176251,2,B000NA6WEU,"I'm a big fan of Gable, but was really disappointed in the poor production values of this film.
The photography and the direction was terrible. They had no idea what they were doing. This could've been such a great documentary on a great American, but it failed. I don't recommend it so save your money.",1426464000,,303,4.527272727272727

8176253,4,B000NA6WEU,Dan Gable is certainly one of the best freestyle wrestlers to ever step on to the mat.  He was clearly an excellent and successful coach as well.  This documentary takes you through his history and provides solid background information.  The only criticism I have - is that it should have included more footage of Dan's actual matches...but overall an excellent DVD.,1312588800,2,366,4.967213114754099

8176255,5,B000NA6WEU,"This D.V.D. on Dan Gable is absolutely awesome! Everyone involved in wrestling at any level should have this documentary in their library. It covers the chronological life story of Dan Gable from his early days of a wrestler in H.S., to College, to International competition & the 1972 Olympics, & then as a legendary coach with the University of Iowa Hawkeyes. It culminates with the final season of Gable's tenure at Iowa, winning his 15th. N.C.A.A. team title in 21 years. I would not hesitate to highly recommend this D.V.D. story to anyone. It is worth it in every way!",1253577600,4,574,4.75
