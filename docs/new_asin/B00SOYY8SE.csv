8699040,5,B00SOYY8SE,"Beautiful documentary showing the communications between a solider and his family during war time. Simple, yet moving, this film left me wanting to know more about this solider and his family. I highly recommend it.",1449878400,2,215,5.171428571428572
8699041,5,B00SOYY8SE,Letters Home to Hero Street shares the long overdue telling of the stories of eight young men and the sacrifice they made for their country and how they represented their country and nationality until the end.  Most of the documentary tells the story of one of the eight as the filmmakers have used his and his family's words written in letters and ascertained through interviews with surviving family members.  I am so looking forward to the time that the Rundles can complete a full length version of this documentary so that more of this story may be told.  The Rundles are superb at preserving an historical topic with accuracy and still providing the emotions behind the events and the individual's reactions.  I encourage those that want to support these fill makers to go to www.fourthwallfilms.com and view all of their projects and lend a hand.,1449878400,2,853,4.862068965517241
8699042,5,B00SOYY8SE,"I, too, went to the premiere showing of this film and found it to be well done and interesting.  I learned much about what it was like to be the one at war missing his family and the ones at home in anxiety about their loved one.  I sincerely hope they will be able to go ahead with filming the full length version of this story as a tribute to these heroes and a reminder to us of the sacrifices that have been made for us.  A beautiful story that we all need to know.",1449878400,,469,3.9157894736842107
8699043,5,B00SOYY8SE,"After coming home today from a premier viewing of this short documentary film I couldn't disagree more with the one star assessment that the first reviewer gave on this work.  This is a moving, compelling work of real life and humanity shared through very distinct specific heartfelt letters to home from one of many from Hero Street that made the ultimate sacrifice to secure this country's freedoms.  I wish Mr Mohr could have been to the premier and listen to those involved in the film, the filmmaker, producer, actors and those engaged in the desire to bring this story to light in this short film format.  Hearing them speak about this important work I believe would have led Mohr to a different viewpoint.  The documentary recently won a Silver Eddy and the Audience Choice Award at the Cedar Rapids Independent Film Festival. These accolades would suggest a rating of one star is clearly unwarranted.

In speaking with the filmmakers I understand this small independent film company has had a vision and desire to tackle this story as a full length doumentary for some time now to bring the full story to America on film.  But that requires backing and funding.  This production is a stepping stone to that end.  Voices of the lost 8 from Hero Street as well as all those who have paid the ultimate price along with their families need to be heard.

No, this short film is not some overly polished, slickly produced hollywood script with all the bells and whistles that would entail.  Rather, it is an historic accounting of the life experiences, emotions, and sacifices that one Hero Street soldier endured which exemplifies what so many of our men and women in uniform and their families have also journeyed through.  Especially those of minority persuasions.  Something we would all do well to remember and honor as we enjoy the bounties that freedom affords us in this country of ours.  Go to the movie's website to view the trailer at herostreetmovie.com and see for yoursef if you agree.  No way is this documentary a one star rating!",1434153600,4,2048,4.78125
