I was concerned that the movie would mostly focus on letter recognition which we already have down pat. She will be five soon and is starting to read. But this movie offers so much more! There's spelling, identifying the missing letter from a word, discovering which letter of the alphabet is missing, solving clues, reading a compass and lots more. My daughter said she was a little bored at the singing parts which surprised me because that's usually her favorite part of movies like this. But I have to agree with her that the songs aren't as fun, catchy, and peppy as they are with other kids shows. But overall, she did say that she really likes the movie and can't wait to watch it again even though she has already watched it three times in one day! This will be a great resource to add to our homeschool lessons.

We received a free copy of this DVD in exchange for our honest opinion about it.",1439251200,,995,4.437158469945355

8717620,5,B00Y7R9G5W,"Both my kiddos have had so much fun watching ABC monsters! And my 4 year old has made up her own song that she sings when she wants to watch it- so I have to say it sparked her imagination too! This is a fun, lively show that was something different from the stuff my kids are ""used to"" watching. It was PERFECT for the long car ride we had planned, and I was happy she was at least talking about letters instead of just staring at a screen for the whole trip. The songs have also proven to force my kiddos to get up and move! They have asked to watch it time and again now, and I know we will be watching for more.",1440979200,,615,3.888888888888889
8717621,5,B00Y7R9G5W,"My daughter absolutely LOVED this movie! She was intrigued the entire time and loved doing things along with the characters! This is the perfect movie to really help your little ones with their letters, recognition, sound, etc. This movie will keep kids focused and interested for good stretch of time! I think this is a great additive for kids in per-school who are learning their shape recognition!",1440720000,,400,4.985074626865671
8717622,5,B00Y7R9G5W,"What a great DVD! This title offers singing, dancing, puzzles and lots of character/viewer interactions throughout the DVD. This did supports inquiry and problem solving. The viewer is prompted to participate in phonic skills and word building via puzzles, games and songs. The animation is clear and colorful and fun to watch. This title is all about learning the alphabet. Each episode is centered around a specific letter. Within that episode, there are fill in the blank word games, songs and repetition of phonics. Any child learning the alphabet would enjoy this DVD. This title is visually very appealing! The animation is great and the songs are original and fun. The DVD cover and box are colorful and have a raised image that makes it stand out.

The kids really loved it. They sat there forever and were completely entertained. ABC Monsters is about some kids who try to find Monster letters like one that looks like a G. They find all the letters so that they don't disappear. The monsters do things that start with their letter, like practicing arrows for A and looking for a bell for B. They sing songs when it's the end, and they ask questions. Actually the kids ask the questions in it. The monsters were nice. Kids would learn the ABC song and a little bit of reading and spelling from watching this. The monsters were funny, and I think kids will like that. We liked that they were trying to find stuff. It was like a mystery treasure hunt. It was exciting, and we liked all the colors. The people in it were nice, and we thought the dancing and singing was fun! We really, really liked it!

ABC Monsters helps young children learn the difference between all the letters in the alphabet through a fun adventure similar to Dora the Explorer. It captures their small attention span in an exciting way that children can easily relate to. There are four fun episodes on this DVD for kids to learn from. Reviewed by a 4 and a 6-year-old.

This DVD stars letters A, B, C and D with 20-minute episodes about each one of these letters. The ABC Monsters live in Capital Castle along with King Wordy, Queen Scribble, their daughter Alice and friend Brian.  There is also Cherry Berry who looks like a fairy that assists in finding the letters when they go missing.  The hairy ABC Monsters spend all their time happily in Alphabet Garden except when one goes missing.  During the adventures of trying to find the missing Monster, kids learn different words that begin with the letter of the episode.  There is also an ABC book that gives clues to the direction of the missing ABC Monster.  While looking for the missing Monster, the child will also have to fill in the blanks for the clues as a part of the adventure.

My favorite part is when Cherry Berry lines up all the ABC Monsters to see who is missing by singing the Alphabet song.  It reminds me of how much fun I used to have singing that song in preschool.  The name Queen Scribble made me laugh so she is my favorite character.  The graphics are extremely colorful which will captures the attention of a child and in each adventure kids learn new words along the way.

This DVD is made specifically for preschoolers and helps with the learning process of the alphabet. Even younger toddlers can benefit from this learning tool. It is a great fit for ages 1 through 5 and both boys and girls will enjoy it because its fun to watch and they can sing along too. I rate this DVD a four out of five dazzling stars!

8717623,4,B00Y7R9G5W,"I was really excited when I heard about this show. It has a lot going for it- a colorful, silly alphabet and an entertaining premise that the letters all need to be back in Alphabet Gardens before nightfall or they will be removed from all the books in Capital Town (adds an element of urgency to finding these letter monsters). In this first release, we meet Alice, Brian and Cherry Berry who have the responsibility of trying to catch the ABC Monsters that are on the loose! Kids will learn about word building, pick up phonics skills and get a chance to participate in a karaoke sing-a-long. This show is cute, but didn't quite capture my almost 4 year old's attention like I had anticipated it would. However, I found it to have educational value for preschoolers and feel like my little guy may show most interest when we watch it again in a month or two. This introductory release includes four episodes that include ""Arrows Gone Astray"", ""Bells, Berries and Bananas"", ""Full Stop Circus"" and ""Dog-on It"" & has a running time of about 110 minutes.",1440115200,,1052,4.6310160427807485
8717624,4,B00Y7R9G5W,"We loved watching Alice experience each adventure. Although my daughter is still a little young to repeat her ABC's, she enjoyed following along and was excited! It will be a great educational tool when she is really ready to learn the ABC's. We loved it!",1440028800,,255,4.688888888888889
8717625,5,B00Y7R9G5W,"This is a great dvd, full of alphabet learning fun! My 4 year old loves it! He's actually learned to write a a few new letters bc of the repetition in the dvd! He's watched this dvd over and over since we've gotten it. I can't wait for the other volumes to come out, I will be purchasing for sure! I highly recommend this dvd!",1440028800,,326,4.030769230769231
