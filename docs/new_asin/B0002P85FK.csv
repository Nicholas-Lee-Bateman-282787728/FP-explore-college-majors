It's a product that pushes you to come up with simple messages that your audience can understand, remember and act upon long after they have left the room.

The product offers a set of tools that works for almost any kind of presentation, whether you are a corporate executive, a social worker, or a scientist. After listening to TJ Walker's tips, I was able to pull out a handful of points from a truckload of facts to deliver what he called the ""30-second watercooler message."" It narrowed the focus of my talk and made the whole process of collecting, writing and delivering my thoughts a lot easier.

For all those aspiring to go from dull to dynamic speakers, this is a great product. It will help you to connect with your audience and make your next presentation a memorable one.",1092787200,,944,4.6467065868263475
