8492261,5,B0063TXAD6,"Afrohorn ""Rare Metal"", An Avant-Gard sonic tapestry of today's Jazz Music. Drummer, composer Francisco Mora-Catlett continues to pursue a very Sun Ra-like mythic exploration of Ancient African and African-American sonic experiences on this second CD from the AfroHORN ensemble. Music as a sacred rite, the unbroken circle of an ongoing tradition. A tribute that moves from ancient folklore to modern urban as one and the same. Spiritually blessed, highly recommended.",1386547200,,467,5.685714285714286
