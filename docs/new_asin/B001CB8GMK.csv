8286386,5,B001CB8GMK,"Fans of the Victory By Design series will love this special Grand Prix series which departs from the earlier series in covering more than one make of automobile. Included in the coverage is the 1914 Mercedes Grand Prix car, which revolutionized engine technology, the Type 35 Bugatti, which some consider the most beautiful racing car ever built, the Auto Union Type D, the first successful mid-engined Grand Prix car, the Lancia Ferrari D50, and the Cooper Climax, these last two from the postwar period. Also included is the Alfa Romeo Bimotore, a two-engined monster created to combat the nearly invincible German Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union cars of the 30s. A welcome carry over from the earlier Victory By Design series is the charming and informed Alain de Cadenet, a veteran racing driver whose demonstrations of the cars performance, insights into the engine and chassis design, and background tidbits of history make this a don't miss tour of Grand Prix history.",1231286400,2,972,5.08125
