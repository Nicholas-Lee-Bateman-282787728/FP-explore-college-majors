8252605,4,B0013PVGN6,"I was at this exhibition match, and being a huge Sampras fan (more like a big USA men's tennis fan), I was disappointed in the outcome and wished Pete had been the one in his prime like Federer was at the time. Pete's serve and volley style would have given Federer a lot less Wimbledon wins as well as US Opens. This is an incredible DVD and a must for anyone who has an admiration (as I do) for two of the greats of our generation.  I am biased but rank the top 5 of our generation 1) Sampras 2) Federer 3) Nadal 4) Djokovic 5) Agassi",1519603200,,536,4.009345794392523

8252608,2,B0013PVGN6,No doubt 2 of the greatest players of all time but as John McEnroe mentioned repeatedly the surface was much too fast and many bad bounces on shots that hit lines.

8252610,5,B0013PVGN6,"The Netjets showdown 2008 is a exhibition match between the 2 greatest male tennis players ever, Pete Sampras who at the time had the record of 14 major titles and Roger Federer who had earned 12 grand slam victories.  The dvd is loaded with bonuses in addition to the 3 hour plus match.

8252612,5,B0013PVGN6,"This is not the first time Sampras and Federer have faced each other. Federer beat Sampras in 2001 in the fourth round at Wimbledon. How on earth does a person who watches tennis casually to not often at all, and who doesn't follow tennis carefully or know all the players involved come to write a review about an exhibition match, let alone reserve the right to call it the best they've ever seen??? Do yourself a favor and find another job, or go watch some actual tennis before you review a DVD about a sport you obviously know nothing about.

----------------------------------------
Although this is an exhibition match, you still get to see high quality tennis from the 2 best men tennis history. It seems like just about every point is a piece of a highlight clip of the entire match. The commentating is lively and the crowd, Federer & Sampras are clearly having fun, yet still trying to win.

This match showcases Pete's exceptional serve and volley play as well as Federer's world class shot making ability to find angles and corners like no other. I'm convinced that Sampras' serve and volley game plays right into Federer's exceptional skill being that he can find the angles that Sampras limits his opponents to by coming to the net. Any other player in this match but Federer, and Sampras would have won.

This DVD is a must have for any Federer fan and certainly any Sampras fan or admirer. It's pretty sweet to see Sampras amazed at some of the shots Federer is able to come up with. Clearly he has a lot of respect for the kid who knocked him out of Wimbledon way back in 2001.

At the time of this match Federer had not yet passed Sampras in Grad Slam wins. Federer would go on to tie Sampras(14) at the 2009 French Open by beating Robin Soderling (SWE) in straights & then go on to pass Sampras at the 2009 Wimbledon, beating Andy Roddick (USA) (for the 4th time in a GS final) in a thrilling 5-setter, 5-7, 7-6(8-6), 7-6(7-5), 3-6, 16-14, it what is to date, the longest men's Grand Slam singles final in terms of games played, 77. It also took 4 hours and 17 minutes to complete, the 5th set alone lasted 95 minutes.

Of course Federer would then go on to pass Sampras by two at the 2010 Australian open (Andy Murray in straights). He is the current all time leader in Grand Slam singles titles with 16 and counting.",1298246400,4,2337,4.489411764705882
8252613,5,B0013PVGN6,These are two of the finest athletes to ever grace a tennis court and this video didn't disappoint.  I enjoyed everything about it especially seeing Pete Sampras play again since I miss watching him these days.  I thought that the video was very well done and enjoyed all the bonus footage - interviews and set-up for the special day.  I highly recommend this video for any fans of mens tennis.,1245196800,4,394,4.6
8252614,5,B0013PVGN6,"Okay, I'm a big tennis nut, plus I used to be a big fan of Sampras and I'm now a big fan of Roger--that would make me the ideal target audience for this dvd, but I hesitated over it. I'm not too keen on exhibitions (""exos"") in general, since they lack the intensity of real matches. Then I saw part of this Madison Square Garden match on cable and I was delighted with the lighter moments it displayed, and wanted to see the rest of the interviews and other features on the dvd.

We can only wonder how Sampras and Federer would have played each other when each was at his peak, say, when they were both 25-26 years old. The one contest between them, the 2001 Wimbledon 4th round match--was played when Pete's career was on the wane and Roger's was on the rise (and when Roger still served-and-volleyed a lot). This MSG exo offers a few hints of what might have been. While Roger was clearly not in top form at the time (still suffering from mono), this match was entertaining. From the way Pete gave Roger surprised looks after some of Roger's dazzling shots, and the way Roger grinned back at him in response, I think Roger's creativity would have edged out Pete's power in a ""top Roger"" vs. ""top Pete"" contest. Also, though I've long admired Pete's fluid game, it was never beautiful, like Roger's game. But whatever you think, it's fun to watch these great champions and speculate.

Both players seemed to enjoy the match and smiled a lot. At 4-4 in the 2nd set, Roger smiled through his entire service motion after Pete missed a return, and kept smiling after the point ended on a close line call. He then gave the point to Pete, saying ""the ball was out"" and Pete applauded him. Pete does a McEnroe impression at one point, and later offers his racquet to Tiger Woods in the front row, so Tiger can play for him. Then Pete wins the next point and does a Tiger-style fist pump to celebrate, and Tiger laughs back at him.

Other highlights:
--at a press conference, Pete refers to the 2001 Wimbledon match saying, "" . . . 8-6 in the fifth"" and Roger interrupts to pipe in ""it was 7-5"", with a grin. Hmm, wonder if Roger has watched that match more often than Pete?
--also at the presser, reporters are asking questions all at once and Pete looks annoyed. Roger shushes them and when they fall silent, grins and says ""what do you know, it works"".

Negatives: Some of the on-court interviews by Justin Gimelstob are annoying. His comment to Roger that ""I didn't think you got nervous; I didn't think you were human"" annoys me to no end, like all comments that assume ""to be human"" means ""to be weak"", since I have long regarded Roger's ability as an example of human ability at its best. Gimelstob's attempt to pump up the crowd by saying ""this isn't England"" was also lame, since he seems to have forgotten that both these gentlemen have every reason to like England, with a total of 12 Wimbledon titles between them (so far). But this is a minor drawback.

It's interesting that both men were nervous about playing an exo. Also, despite the smiles, both competitors clearly wanted to win. When Pete seemed poised to win the 3rd set, Roger cranked it up with an acing display that had them smiling. Both men clearly like and respect each other, which is nice to see. Pete seems to regard Roger more as an heir than as a rival, and really doesn't seem to mind seeing Roger break all his records, since it enriches tennis as a whole.

After he won the 2008 US Open, Roger credited this MSG exo in March as a reason why the NY crowds supported him in August and September. Well I'm sure the exo didn't hurt and we'd love to see more tennis at the Garden, but there are a lot of people who cheered Roger in NY anyway, even before this exo (and even when playing Americans!). On the whole, I greatly enjoyed this dvd and I'm glad I bought it. As a fan of fast-court tennis, it will help me slog through the clay court season.",1240272000,13,3923,4.396694214876033
