7364078,5,B013FDBGWO,I was looking for a Care Bears DVD set for my daughter she's 4 months old. It's her theme. So we got these because they always want to charge an arm and a leg for three episodes with each bear. This give  you a total of 22 Episodes. Now while they may be old episodes that doesn't change the fact that they still keep her interest. This has made car rides so much easier to be able to have the DVD set this long that my daughter can enjoy. Plenty of hours of watching fun for any child or grown up.,1457827200,5,498,3.9306930693069306

7364087,2,B013FDBGWO,"I ordered this because my daughter loved the Care Bear movie. These cartoons are not as good. The plots are cheesy. The animation is bad quality.  Maybe an older kid would get these episodes and enjoy it, but not for preschool or early elementary level.",1506988800,,253,4.622222222222222

7364090,4,B013FDBGWO,"Product is fine! I was super excited & nostalgic about this... but after watching it through the lens of Mommyhood with a 3 year old, wow, this is a little different by today's standards; a little creepy, at times a bit awkward/borderline inappropriate based on today's parenting. It made me giggle to see how very, very much things change over several decades. Still great for nostalgia factor!

7364092,4,B013FDBGWO,"Just to help clear this up a little. This set of the first TV series, the ones made by DiC. The character designs are similar, but more simply and variably drawn. The chief villains are Professor Coldheart and Frostbite.

If you are looking for the ABC Saturday Morning version, the version most people think of, you want to look for the ones done by Nelvana. The chief villains are No Heart, Beastly and Shreeky.",1500422400,13,413,4.581081081081081
7364093,3,B013FDBGWO,"I bought this for my kid, but i didn't realize that these are the original episodes. No beastly, shrieky or no-heart and all my favorite characters. Professor coldheart not half as exciting as beastly, so i was bit disappointed. Also the old format is not as sharp as the newer ones. So just keep that in mind when you buy this.",1500336000,,328,4.39344262295082
