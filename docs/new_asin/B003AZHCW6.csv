Sure the whole thing winds up with a zippy little car ballet along a Spanish highway, but up till that point, there's not a whole lot of speed to this routine crime drama.  Roschdy is told to go undercover in a drug smuggling operation, namely because of his ethnic origins.  Learning to drive a car and wear a wire are about the only hardcore training this cop seems to need to go deep deep into this dangerous world.  If the movie had more substance, like recent French crime sagas like MR73 or 36, then, it could be forgiven for its lack of action.  If it profiled an elaborate drug kingpin's operation, sure, it could've been absorbing (as it stands, the big drug machinations are about as intricate as picking up a dime bag outside the local Starbucks...well, maybe a little more involving).  Anyway, if you've got a crisp 80 minutes -- plus an additonal 10 for end credits -- to kill in your day, sit down, shift gears, and 'go fast.'",1285632000,,974,4.443820224719101
