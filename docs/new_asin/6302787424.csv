7831787,2,6302787424,"Dream Demon is about a rich girl that's about to marry a military man but gets real stressed out about it. She moves in her family's old mansion to get away from the paparazzi and stuff. That's when the nightmares start to get worse and sometimes she can't tell dreams from reality. There's a troubled teen that she meets and just invites her to stay..then both get sucked into the nightmare.
It's a pretty confusing movie with little to no scares..and I never seen no demon or anything close to being scary. It's more silly than anything, kinda dull.",1383868800,,551,4.575757575757576
7831788,2,6302787424,"There ARE some real gems to be found in the VHS Tape (i.e., never released on DVD) market, but not this movie.  I bought it on the cheap as a used videotape because I like Kathleen Wilhoite.  This talented character actress was wasted due to a nonsensical plot.  I felt the screenplay must've been written over a weekend by a recent film school grad.  Alas, Wilhoite has been relegated to either big roles in in terrible movies (e,g, ""Murphy's Law"") or too small roles in better films (e.g., ""Lorenzo's Oil"" and ""The Edge"").

I wish Wilhoite would get a better agent before age diminishes opportunity (she's not yet 50).",1342483200,,620,4.651376146788991
