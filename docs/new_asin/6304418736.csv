8166281,5,6304418736,"This film is an update of Linda Moulton-Howe's Emmy award-winning TV documentary about the cattle mutilations (though they might be more correctly described as `dissections'), focusing on those in North America, originally broadcast in 1980.

All would acknowledge that, however questionable some of LMH's more recent output might be, back in the 1980s and 1990s the original work on the cattle mutes placed her centre-stage as a pioneering reporter bringing uncomfortable facts about this worrying phenomenon to public attention. This work remains some of the best-ever in the field, and the plaudits and awards were entirely deserved.

The film is excellent. Ranchers in several states (notably Alabama where much of the action took place), law enforcement personnel, veterinarians, surgeons, members of the military (the helicopter connection) are all interviewed. Carcases of mutilated/dissected cattle are shown to demonstrate the very precise laser-like surgical techniques used by the perpetrators to remove eye tissue, flesh from the jaw, udders and sex organs whilst apparently ignoring the rest of the animal. Animals are found in locations with no tracks around them, not even their own. Possible culprits are methodically discussed: military/government agencies; satanic cults; natural predators; pranksters: all ruled out. Only the hypothesis of UFO occupants as perpetrators consistently fits the evidence, paradigm-stretching though that might be: UFOs are frequently witnessed at the scene of the crime by ranchers and other observers, and if true then official silence on the issue is understandable.

It's difficult to understand why, in 2011, this documentary is not available on DVD. However, you're stuck with 1980s technology: videotape is the only format available. If you can get over that irritant, then you should see this film. It's documentary film-making of the highest calibre, the subject matter is important and these mutilations continue to the present day with little variation in modus operandi by the perpetrators.",1312848000,3,2050,5.671009771986971
8166282,5,6304418736,"A shocking but true introduction to UAD's, Unexplained, Unusual, Unnatural, and until now, Unsolved Animal Deaths. Linda Howe, a newscaster  from Denver won a Emmy for the first of these videos ""A Strange  Harvest"" back in 1980 for her coverage of what can really be called  animal dissections instead of mutilations. She makes a strong UFO  connection in the first documentary. In 1993, a wave of UFOs and UADs  occurred in Alabama, and the second of her videos, done that year, records  the mystery of UADs. Video footage shot by local people of UFOs are shown,  as well as interviews with law enforcement officials, scientists,  vetenarians, and ranchers who have been involved with UADs. These videos  are not for the squeamish, as they include graphic footage of dissected  animals, but they show UADs for what they are...evidence of  extraterrestrail visits.",965865600,11,864,5.1
8166283,5,6304418736,"In a world of normalicy, Linda Moulton Howe has given us food for thought with her frightening documentary detailing many cases of Cattle Mutillations in the US, Canada and England.  The cases are very well  documented, the evidence is real.  This is not a hoax.  The biggest  question remains, who, or what, is doing this to the animals?",937008000,10,338,4.758620689655173
