1405341,3,B000059HCH,"Despite what the majority of reviewers have said, this is not the greatest horror film ever made.  It's not even close.  While the concept is intriguing, some of the images disturbing, and the end suitably twisted, the writers missed Ghost Stories 101.  What makes a great ghost story is history.  The Ring had too many holes in the story for it to really be effective.  I haven't seen the DVD, so maybe some of that problem will be alleviated with the bonus material, but my initial impression is one of either poor writing or poor story editing.  The most effective device in this film was the use of sound.  Rarely have I encountered a film in which the sound acts like a character.  For a truly frightening film, try The Changeling or The Haunting (the original).",1043107200,2,767,4.588235294117647
1405342,5,B000059HCH,"when i first saw the commercials for ""the ring"", i knew that this movie was going to be something different than the run of the mill horror movie, and couldn't wait to watch it.  (i'm not even a horror movie lover)
i must say, this is the SCARIEST movie i have ever seen.  from the beginning sequence, your curiosity is tweaked as to why someone dies seven days from watching a mysterious (and disturbing) video.  as the movie progresses, the deeper and more unpredictable it gets, with each scene relevant in leading up to a killer, twisted ending.
i don't go into details about the plot b/c the more the story is revealed, the less entertaining it is.  so entertaining, i couldn't sleep for days after this movie.
i applaud anyone who puts this in the dvd player more than once.",1043020800,,780,4.51063829787234
1405343,4,B000059HCH,"This American remake of the 1998 Japanese classic ""Ringu"" does a fairly good job of staying true to the original film, and novel somewhat.  The story is new to the horror genre in the west, which revolves around a cursed videotape that kills its viewers  seven days after viewing it.  Gore Verbinski does a good job of keeping the visuals pretty chilling throughout the film.  Unfortunately, the story line lacks somewhat, and the viewer can't helped but feel that the movie is being rushed at some points, and drags on incoherently in others.  Still, if you turn your mind off and just take in the movie instead of processing it on your first viewing, you'll get a good deal of the story down; you can then go back and view it again if you have any further questions about where the story is going.  In the end, this film is a very decent and fresh addition to a rather stale genre in American cinema.  Like the original Japanese version, which spawned three sequels, a hit television series, and popular manga, the American version leaves the ending of the movie very open for a possible sequel.  For a step in a new direction, I recommend at least one viewing of this film, if only for fun.",1042934400,,1193,4.5162790697674415
1405344,5,B000059HCH,"Ignore the Amazon Editorial on this film, this one's a winner!  I've probably watched more horror films than most people. Time and time again I'm disappointed in how bad most of them are. There have been a few recent exceptions including The Others and Frailty, but for the most part horror has been awful (e.g., They). I was incredibly impressed with The Ring. Sure, it has a few lose ends, but for pure creep-factor, it ranks up there among the best horror films I've ever seen.  This is one of the rare films that actually gave me goosebumps!  Normally I'm pretty unflappable when it comes to horror movie scares, but this film has several whoppers, especially the final 10 minutes.  This film does everything right; no stupid humor, no Dawson's Creek cast members, and no terrible rock soundtrack that will be outdated a year from now.  This film is just crackles with a creepy intensity.  From the moment it begins, it moves.  You won't be bored for one second.  Once it ends, you'll want to watch it again immediately.  I've watched it three times and I've learned more and more each time I've watched it.  I promise you that you will never look at your television the same way again. . .",1042761600,8,1194,4.589622641509434

1405408,5,B000059HCH,"As a longtime horror fan, I thought, by my mid 20s, nothing could ever really creep me out anymore.  Then I watched this movie (and I almost saw Ghost Ship instead because they mistakenly sat us in the wrong theater lol).  That ending.  The distorted faces.  The whole eerie atmosphere.  Wow.  Plus when I got home I noticed I had exactly 1 unheard message on my voicemail O_O  Dude...  Needless to say, I hid until others came home, haha (and this was broad daylight).

Eventually it got me into Asian horror and it wasn't long before I checked out the original film - Ringu (and also read the novel by Koji Suzuki, basically became a Ring fanboy, and Japanese fanboy by extension, haha).  I won't say The Ring is the better film, both are stronger in some areas and less strong in others.  I think this one is better at keeping an overall creepy atmosphere and creepy imagery going throughout, plus I'm usually partial to whichever version I see first, but Ringu's ending creeped me out even more (that eye), which is saying something, since I already knew what was going to happen, having seen this version first lol

But yes, this is one of the better movie remakes out there of any genre - Gore Verbinski did a great job and really paved the way for ""J-Horror"" to become more mainstream in America (not just the remakes, but making tons of Asian horror titles more available in video stores, etc).  I know I probably wouldn't have known about it without The Ring.  And my life would be much poorer for that.  So yes, while some are zombie nuts (and that's fine, love The Walking Dead), I must really have a thing for lonely, long dark haired, vengeful, creepily moving ghost girls - we like what we like :)

1405440,4,B000059HCH,"Well, this was basically an American version of RINGU. It starred Naomi Watts, a fairly decent actress. I liked it, but I wouldn't call it a 5 star horror flick with scare tactics coming at you every five or ten seconds. It is basically an investigative horror movie. Not that scary, for certain. Creepy, yeah, I would say that. The story is around a girl with some very unique talents, but her parents don't want her and she ends up dead. But is she really?
Naomi's character, an investigative reporter for a Seattle based Newspaper sets out to find the real story behind all the recent deaths. A tape is said to be the cause. You see, after watching it, you only have about 7 days before you end up dead. Now, who thought of only putting 7 days on it, is another story altogether. Come on, give 'em some more time! lol
Today it wouldn't work, because VHS is a long ""dead"" format and anyone who actually has a VHS player would be up to the challenge of fighting this paranormal little lady. They would most likely end up with a severe case of water in the ears. lol
All around it is not a total loss of a movie, just not that scary.
The Bluray does have a few Special Features, which is nice.

1405448,4,B000059HCH,"The Ring starts off with a very creepy introduction. It's shot in a way that tells you everything you need to know but does it in a way that throws you off. Things you expect to see, you don't see. Things you expect characters to do, they don't do. It plays with your expectations to keep you on your toes.

With a Ring reboot on the way (don't watch the trailer, it shows you everything), I thought it would be fun to revisit this movie. This is a well-made horror movie. Every shot and bit of acting seem well-calculated. You have to suspend your disbelief a little bit at the premise, but if you go with it, you will be creeped outespecially once The Tape starts playing without interruption. The shots in tape feel very planned out and you will remember a majority of it once the movie is over.

Another reason I bought this was for the steelbook. The movie comes in a simple steelbook with the film's main marketing image on the front. It's a nice case to add to your collection.

1405620,5,B000059HCH,"Through his remake of Hideo Nakata's movie Ringu, which is based on Koji Suzuki's excellent novel, Gore Verbinski did a great job proving that one can pull an adaptation that respects its original story while adding an atmosphere and mystery that doesn't betray the plot. That of a mysterious videotape which can kill you after seven days if you do happen to watch it. Which is what happens to Katie Embry; a teenager whose aunt, the reporter Rachel Keller, tries both to make a story on this curse and to give justice for that poor girl's tragic death. At the price of watching the said tape, forcing her, in a race against time, to save her own life and of Aidan, her son who ends up watching the tape accidentally (or not, considering his strange premonitions/connection with Katie).

A movie that still packs a punch today for its efficient suspense, scary antagonist, and compelling mystery, Verbinski's ""The Ring"" is set in a Seattle always drenched in rain, through a clever cinematography by Bojan Bazelli that constantly reminds you of water, important symbol in the movie, and very subtle use of Hans Zimmer's music that make the movie's tension more natural rather than through a pleonastic soundtrack which too many movies end up using. By the way, I find it very neat that the movie doesn't start with any opening credits or movie titles as those effects might have broken the film's magic. Which makes you ask the question if people do need, when watching a tape/DVD/or cinema screening of a movie, to be told again the title of the movie they are watching? As if they didn't know the story they watch is called ""The Ring"".

As for the actors, everyone gives a spectacular and convincing performance, in particular Naomi Watts as ""Rachel Keller"", Daveigh Chase as ""Samara"", and David Dorfman as ""Aiden Keller"". All three having the perfect strength for their role to stand out through this movie I consider a nice classic of Horror film.

1405648,4,B000059HCH,"At the time of its release I went into 2002's ""The Ring"" with some slight trepidation.  A half dozen of my film students had already seen it before I did, and they seemed evenly divided on its merits.  Three of them thought it was scarier than heck, and the other three thought it was boring.

Then along came my reviewing colleague, Eddie Feng, on a trip to California where we met for the first time.  Eddie had already seen the movie and liked it, and I asked him if he wouldn't mind seeing it again.  He said sure, but it occurred to me I might be placing myself in an awkward situation.  What if I didn't like the film?  I hardly wanted my first visit with Eddie spoiled by a disagreement.  I mean, it was like getting a Christmas gift from your Aunt Martha and being asked to open it in front of her.  What do you say if you really hate it?

Fortunately, no such dilemma presented itself.  I enjoyed the film quite a lot, if a little less and for slightly different reasons than Eddie.  But first let me make one thing clear:  ""The Ring"" came out at about the same time as another horror movie, the abhorrent ""FearDotCom,"" which had a similar premise.  ""FearDotCom"" was about a deadly Web site, ""The Ring"" about a deadly video tape.  However, there the similarities stopped.  While ""FearDotCom"" was a typically crude, clumsy gore-fest, ""The Ring"" is an accomplished and stylish thriller.

Based on the big-screen Japanese hit movie ""Ringu"" from 1998 and a series of Japanese television shows that Eddie will list below, the DreamWorks production of ""The Ring"" likely surpasses them all in technique and execution.  You wouldn't know that from the first few minutes, though, since the film begins, teasingly, like almost every slasher movie in history, with two teenage girls alone in a house on a dark, stormy night.  They're telling each other ghost stories, and one says, ""Have you heard about this video tape that kills you when you watch it?""  And as soon as you watch it, she explains, ""your phone rings and someone says, 'You will die in seven days.'""  Then, before you die, you see ""the ring.""  Well, one of the girls reveals that she has, indeed, watched such a tape the week before, and then the phone rings!  We expect any moment a meat hook to come slashing out of the shadows or a carving knife to start severing body parts.  But not to worry; nothing in this film is quite what you expect it to be.

In fact, for a traditional horror thriller, this film from director Gore Verbinski (who went on to do the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and ""Rango"") is decidedly untraditional.  Unlike most such scary movies these days, ""The Ring"" depends mainly on sights, sounds, music, and imaginative lighting and camera work--zooms, pans, close-ups galore--to build and maintain suspense; and on red herrings and mysterious characters and things that go bump in the night.  There is very little actual blood or gore involved, yet there are a couple of good starts and a few images that may make you turn your head away.

The picture stars Naomi Watts in an overlooked Oscar-worthy performance, an oversight possibly the result of the film's not being deemed part of a serious-enough genre to deserve consideration; I don't know.  Anyway, she plays a mother, Rachel Keller, whose young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), is having premonitions about people's deaths.  Subsequently, the police find these people with their hearts stopped and horrible, ghastly expressions on their face.  Clearly, they have died of fright, and Aidan may know something about it.

Rachel becomes involved when Aidan correctly predicts his cousin's death, and the victim's friends claim a video tape caused it.  Rachel, an investigative news reporter, begins looking into the matter and finds related deaths, tracing them to a single night, the victims all viewing the same tape.

As much a detective-mystery thriller as a horror film, things get progressively eerier as the movie goes on.  Rachel gets hold of the tape and naturally, being inquisitive and unbelieving, she watches it.  Too bad for her.  The bizarre pictures on the tape appear to tell a story, and Rachel soon learns that she has only the allotted seven days to figure out what it means or...well, you guessed it.  The plot plays out in those seven days, counted down one day at a time.

Rachel manages to enlist the aid of a friend, Noah (Martin Henderson), a video consultant who is understandably skeptical at first but eventually helps her in the investigation.  Although there is a small but solid supporting cast involved, this is almost entirely Ms. Watts's movie, and beyond the introductory sequence she is in practically every scene.  She is convincing all the way.

The movie is perfectly creepy in the best possible sense, director Verbinski taking his cue largely from Hitchcock and ""Psycho.""  There's a creepy Bates-like motel in the country run by a creepy Norman Bates-like manager, plus a highly suggestive shower scene and even a climactic shot of a chair turning slowly around with a body in it.  Moreover, Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lecter in ""Manhunter"") is on hand as a creepy old guy with a creepy old farmhouse and an even creepier young daughter.  That would be Samara (Daveigh Chase), of whom people say, ""She never sleeps.""

It's hard to take your eyes off the screen for a second.  Part of this is because the film and its characters are so fascinating to watch, and part of it is because if you do look away or blink twice, you're sure to miss some important plot device.  Woe to thee who does.

I have to admit that I found the middle of the picture somewhat flat, and by the second half I thought the plot became a little too convoluted for its own good, throwing in one too many twists and turns and anticlimaxes, ending on an ambiguous note.  Yet, overall, ""The Ring"" has more than its fair share of unsettling images, chilling scenes, and disturbing junctures.  Warts and all, ""The Ring"" was without a doubt the best horror film of 2002 and holds up pretty well today.

Video:
The folks at DreamWorks do a good job transferring the film to Blu-ray.  Although its theatrical aspect ratio measures an ordinary 1.85:1, the video quality is anything but ordinary.  Using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode, the video engineers provide a clear, clean, sharply defined image.  The filmmakers purposely did up the colors in blue-gray and green-gray metallic shades in many instances, and they look quite good.  Dark areas reveal plenty of inner detail, with strong contrasts and good depth and dimensionality.  The film never intends the various muted hues to be realistic but to create atmosphere, and the video reproduction renders them nicely, with a modest degree of natural print grain.

Audio:
The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 matches the quality of the picture, with excellent front-channel separation and a few well-placed surround noises.  Dialogue sounds especially well rendered, and all of the channels produce firm dynamics and deep bass.  It's true, there is not a huge amount of information fed to the side and rear channels, but what there is comes through effectively, things like the ambiance of Hans Zimmer's relatively subdued but spooky musical soundtrack, ghostly creakings, and, naturally, rain (we are in the Northwest, after all, so expect a lot of rain).  How did we ever enjoy rain before surround sound?

Extras:
DreamWorks have included the extras they did on their special-edition DVD, most of them this time in high def.  The first item is the best, the featurette ""Don't Watch This"" (HD).  It's a fifteen-minute mini movie that uses mostly alternate and deleted material to create a different way of looking at the same subject matter.  It's one of the few bonus items I've enjoyed on disc, and it conveys its own moments of tension.

In addition, we get another mini-movie, ""Rings"" (HD), a sixteen-minute continuation of the ""ring"" mythology, kind of a stopover between the original ""Ring"" and the dreadful ""Ring 2"" sequel.  After that is a series of cast and filmmaker interviews, eight minutes; ""The Origin of Terror,"" four minutes on urban legends in general; and a widescreen theatrical trailer (HD).

The bonuses conclude with twenty-three scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  A flimsy Eco-case houses the disc, the case further enclosed in a slipcover with a handsome 3-D holographic picture on it.

Parting Thoughts:
Although ""The Ring"" didn't particularly scare me, I found its tensions undeniable, its moods gripping, its suspense forceful, and its cast excellent.  Just don't let that premise of a haunted VHS tape bother you as it did me at first.  It may seem a bit corny that a small video cassette could accommodate the soul of some arcane, ghostly entity, but the gimmick works.  Just let it play out.  The movie, I mean, not the tape.  Let the tape play out, and you're in for some lethal trouble.",1434672000,,9104,4.863636363636363

1405677,5,B000059HCH,"This a masterfully crafted film in every respect. The cinematography is exceptionally vivid and many times disturbing in very subtle ways. It's a film that draws the viewer in quickly at first, and then pulls back and turns into a supernatural who-done-it (or perhaps what-done-it). A reporter, Rachel
Keller (Naomi Watts), tracking down a videotape that supposedly kills anyone who watches it, finds the tape and of course, watches it herself, not realizing that the tape is in fact, a real killer flick. The phone rings after she watches it and a voice tells her she has seven days.
Strange things begin to happen after the phone call. Things that begin to slowly convince her that perhaps the watching of the video did, in fact coincide with the timelines of those who watched it and mysteriously died exactly seven days later. She has visions of a little girl, apparently the victim of a horrible drowning, and her young son somehow has a psychic link to her also. With the help of her ex-boyfriend, who is of course disbelieving at first (who in their right mind wouldn't be?), they go on a convoluted quest to find out about the tape, and more importantly, the little girl who seems to be the key to it all.
Therein, is how the film draws you seductively into it's web. Without gore or things constantly jumping out at you, this film will chill you with good acting, atmospheric camera work (some of the best I've seen, and I watch a lot of horror films), and a good plot, if you're into supernatural horror movies. Although, I think even people who aren't into horror might enjoy this as well. It's just that well done.
A supernatural detective flick, if you will. In fact, you never even actually see anyone killed, except for the poor suicidal father of the drowned little girl
(Brian Cox) who puts a horse-bit in his mouth and electrocutes himself.
I like the things this movie shows that frighten, but what I like even more are the things it doesn't show. And I like the fact it doesn't explain too much either. The mother of the little girl wasn't supposed to be able to have a child. But apparently they used alternative methods at some overseas clinic. So what did they bring back with them? A child...or something else? This part isn't even revealed in the movie itself, but in the bonus footage. Watch the part that says 'Don't watch this!' . I watched it. So far I'm still alive.

1405680,5,B000059HCH,"Just about the only USA made horror movie as good as its Asian original. And the original Ringu is pretty good.
When it comes to Juon/The Grudge and Shutter, stick with the original foreign versions--those are superior.

This one is actually decent and will scare the crap out of the kids (and adults) but is not overly gory,  gross, or sexual, so kids as young as ""tweens"" could feasibly watch it--and there are no subtitles to read through. My big, tough, 12 yr old nephew couldn't get through 2 minutes of the beginning with the lights turned low--he made me turn it off after begging me to watch it on vacation one night after his younger siblings went to bed, and he's watching walking dead on AMC now! That is the power of pure atmosphere and suspense, as opposed to CGI blood and gore! Although I do love that as well, it wears thin pretty fast. Luckily walking dead has superior writing and characters--sometimes--to keep it going, but I digress...

There are some visual issues with the way the movie portrays a certain character in terms of what the year is supposed to be for some video ""flashbacks"" (is it 1874 or 1974?), but that's pretty minor stuff compared to the overall impact. The only real drawback in terms of ""dating"" is that the story turns on the notion of recordings mysteriously appearing on VHS tapes, a dated technology for sure--do the kids today even know what those things are any more?",1424649600,2,1417,4.615079365079365

1405803,4,B000059HCH,"As an aficionado of horror films for over 40 years, i have see my share of bad to excellent horror films. The can range from pure gut horror to psychological suspense thrillers. This one falls into the latter category. ""The Ring"" is an Americanized of a 1998 Japanese horror film called ""Ringu."" The basic plot is an urban legend about a videotape that brings a curse upon anyone who watches it - they die at the end of seven days. The forewarning comes in the form of a phone call to the unfortunate viewer gets after watching the video. The whispered message of ""seven days"" rankles the intended victim. Soon later, the victim is found with horribly swollen facial features and a look of terror. Also, the victims suffer from nose bleeds, see a ring of light and have a fearful sense of foreboding doom.

Thrown into this world is Rachel, a divorced mother of a child - Rachel (Naomi Watts) whose niece dies as a victim of the tape. She bravely begins to investigate how and why she died. Eventually, she learns of the tape and watches it. In time, her son, Aidan begins to be affected. Rachel turns to her estranged husband, Noah for help. Desperate to discover the mystery of the tape and the woman featured on it, rachel becomes a detective. Yes, Noah and her son Aidan do watch the video. The middle part of the movie is thrilling and a race against time as Rachel tries to find out more about the woman, 'Anna. As Rachel uncovers more facts about Anna Morgan, she finds out about Anna's adopted daughter, Samara (who is featured at the end of the tape. The movie continues to raise more questions as the tension builds. Who is Samara? What happened to her? Why is she on videotape? Can one avoid the curse?
This steady but tense movie is well-directed and the viewer will enjoy the ride. Naomi Watts is perfectly cast and the little girl playing Samara is perfectly creepy. I enjoyed it but had two complaints: I did not like what happened to Noah or Rachel's attitude toward the tape at the end of the movie.",1409788800,,2016,4.493188010899183

1405846,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring is an American adaptation of a Japanese horror film.  There are of course purists who think that the original Japanese movie is far better and this one should not have even been made.  If you have never seen the Japanese film and have no prior frame of reference, then that fact is not going to bother you.

It starts out with an almost urban legend kind of feel.  We learn in the very beginning that there is a VHS tape out there that, if you watch it, you receive a phone call with a cryptic message ""7 days"", and exactly 7 days later the viewer dies.  The main character's (Rachel played by Naomi Watts) niece dies at the beginning of the movie, and Rachel begins investigating her death.  In the process watches the tape, and it then becomes a race against time to save herself, her ex husband and her son.

The movie is much more psychological thriller than slasher.  There is very little in the way of gore to the movie, it is all surprise and suspense.  Most of the movie is trying to figure out the back story of the images that play out on the tape and piece together what happened.  It is not really a movie that you can have on in the background and get what is going on.  You do have to pay pretty close attention to what is going on after it gets going.  So if you are not into those kinds of movies, you will probably not like this one.

I am not sure that the version of the DVD I have even exists anymore, so I am not sure that the extras on my version (which do not amount to much, just a short featurette that functions as almost a compilation of deleted scenes that fill in some of the gaps of the story) and trailers for other movies apply to what is out there now.  Since you can stream it online I am not sure if it is a must own on DVD or blu ray but if you like extras you may want to do some investigating about what is out there on the various versions.

Like is the case with any movies, whether you like this or not is totally subjective.  It is definitely a smarter horror movie, in the sense that you can even call it a horror movie.  It is much better than the teen based horror films that were coming out in the late 90s early 2000s that were not Scream.  If you like smart, suspenseful and kind of creepy movies, this is definitely worth giving a shot.",1400803200,,2294,4.116853932584269

1405885,4,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"", which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.

Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), ""The Ring"" is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.

Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.

Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. ""The Ring"" effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's ""The Grudge"" and it's sequels.

Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of ""The Ring"" and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent ""From Within"" (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of ""The Ring."" Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.

The film runs 115 minutes.

1405892,4,B000059HCH,"This movie was really intense from the very beginning and it only picked up from there.  It wasn't really horror so much as a suspense thriller, but with some scary elements such as short flashes of the tape.  At one point in the movie it just flashes the ring for a couple frames, which is amazing for psychological terror.  To sum it up, I really liked this movie and I thought it was very suspenseful and thrilling.",1383177600,,418,4.402597402597403

1405935,3,B000059HCH,I liked the film for the most part because it was very creepy and had a great atmosphere to it.  The characters were pretty interesting as well.  This movie doesn't rely too much on gore or violence.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about were certain aspects of the ending.,1379289600,,272,4.4
1405936,4,B000059HCH,"In terms of picture and sound, this Blu-Ray of ""The Ring"" delivers the goods. I've always loved the cinematography in this film and the blue/green color palette used to bring the world of Samara Morgan to life and here in 1080p, the film looks gorgeous. The surround sound is used to creepy effect with an active mix that also does a good job when the film requires something with a little more subtlety and ambiance during its quieter moments.

The extras are pretty much the exact same deal as the DVD release, save for the inclusion of the terrific short film, ""Rings"", which serves as a bridge between this film and its terrible sequel, ""The Ring Two"". I'd go so far as to say that ""Rings"" is a far better work than ""The Ring Two"" in its entirety. Other extras include some cast and crew interviews and a montage of deleted scenes.

""The Ring"" is still effective after all these years, even if none of us still have our old VHS players. This Blu-Ray does right by the film with solid presentation and a decent set of extras.",1377820800,3,1028,4.462765957446808

Well if you saw the Crying Game you would know, but this movie left it out of the Ring and still it was scary and made me wonder if she was going to come through my TV while I was sleeping. Japan can make very scary movies and books in English and they can make a flop too. This was a movie you would like to sit with someone and all lights on even when sleeping. It's A top winner and better then the book and better then The Ring Two. Scary buffs it's a Must See and have. Try it if you haven't seen it yet.

1405954,3,B000059HCH,"The American remake of  Hideo Nakata's brilliant masterpiece, ""Ring(u)"", is like a very good episode of ""X-files"", but it can't touch the visionary genius of the original picture. Performances in ""The Ring"" are good - 'cept why they portrayed the father as a hipster goofball when they have Hiroyuki Sanada's awesome performance as a reference, I'll never understand. The original film was a fairly small production (around $12 million) that became an enormous hit around the world. I came across it on a business trip in London and learned later that it was kept out of the US when Dreamworks bought the rights for an American remake - which is a bit of a shame because the original tends to be a bit ""ruined"" by those who see the remake first (spoilers have already been exposed, as it were, and horror suffers greatly when the ending is spoiled). Also, the slick production values of ""The (American) Ring"" ($48 million) tend to ""take away from"" instead of ""add to"" the suspension of disbelief that Nakata's small production achieves. If you're the kind of person who doesn't like reading subtitles, then this is about as good as it gets for experiencing the quiet sense of dread and creepiness that good Japanese horror can generate. Enjoy.",1371254400,2,1243,4.835680751173709

1405957,4,B000059HCH,"After her niece dies mysteriously, Rachel begins to track a cursed tape that causes the viewer to die a week after watching. She watches the tape, which forces her to find the origin of the tape and end the curse. The Ring is a scary and entraining film.

The story in this film is scary and creative like the original film, Ringu. However, The Ring does expand on the ideas and scenes of the original film, in turn, adding more details to the story and a couple of jump scares; also adding around 15 minutes to the original film's runtime, excluding credits. This film is a bit more graphic, and louder. The tape isn't as realistic as the original, but creepy, nonetheless. Samara is also more reliant on make-up and special effects. Don't get me wrong, these additions don't significantly hurt the film, but they do make The Ring a more obvious, or blatant, horror film; on the other hand, the atmosphere in Ringu created a suspenseful, creepy feeling of ambiguous horror. The horror in this film is welcomed, I don't mind the different types of horror films. The acting was great, and I enjoyed the film's cinematography.

The Blu-ray version of this film has great picture and audio quality; the film looks amazing. It has a few special features including interviews, theatrical trailers, and ""Rings"" and ""Don't Watch This"" featurettes. Quality-wise, this is definitely the definitive version.

Overall, The Ring is a frightening film that builds upon what the original created; it's a remake that works. I recommend a purchase for fans of horror, a rental otherwise.

The Ring has some disturbing imagery and violence.",1368230400,2,1623,4.869565217391305

I really don't enjoy the bloodfests that are commonly associated with horror, and The Ring isn't that kind of horror. It's subtle, well written, and got my skin crawling in a way I've haven't felt in a long time.

1405993,5,B000059HCH,"I have found memories of this movie, it was out around the time I was first on my own from my parents house and was one of the first movies I watched alone and in the dark.  Did not sleep for around 3 days afterwards. . .then again I did watch it 3 nights in a row.

It has held up, I watched it last Halloween and although it wasn't scary this time around I still enjoyed it and realized that it is a really good movie as far as filming goes, great locations, sets, and thus atmosphere.  Acting wasn't half bad either and you know, a ghost coming through a TV screen is freaky.  I'm sorry, some people said it was dumb but EVERYONE watches TV, they are everywhere, so if the ghost can get you that way then it is going to get you sooner or later.

The second movie took it down a few notches though, not because it was good but because it was horrible, if I could forget it I would enjoy this movie much more.

I'm going to get it on Blu-ray, this is a movie that I enjoyed multiple times and probably will multiple times more.  My DVD copy is kinda beat up and I notice it isn't as clear as it could be.  This movie has apparently come out on Bluray last march and it got 4.8/5 on video and 4.5/5 on audio on blu-ray.com and that site is picky.  The only thing it did poor on was Extras, a measly 2.8/5, but I don't care just as long as it has a way to access the full 'ring' movie that get you killed like the DVD had.  Hopefully they hide it like they did on the DVD so it makes it all the more fun.  Seeing how they made the movie would just spoil it for me, I like 'the making of' on all but horror movies.  Anyway, I'll update my rating when I watch it, I'll get it in the next few weeks but I'll save the viewing for sometime in October.",1347148800,,1745,3.9261363636363638

I never saw the original Ringu, so I'm not sure how good of an adaptation The Ring was, but thought that it was an excellent film from start to finish.",1344124800,,391,3.9240506329113924

1405997,5,B000059HCH,"SAMORA LIKES to hurt things. Even dead, the little girl is out for scares and blood - pretty much in that order. It's the hallmark of the Japanese horror movie, ""Ringu,"" originally directed by Hideo Nakata, remade as ""The Ring"" for English-speaking viewers and directed by Gore Verbinski of ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Yes, there are pitiable elements to Samora's story, but in the end, she is a very bad little girl.

Japanese horror plays by its own rules as evidenced by ""The Ring,"" the first of its kind. It has a staunch fan base while its commercial success spawned American remakes of ""Ju-on"" (""The Grudge,"" 2004), ""Pulse"" (""Pulse"" 2006), and ""Dark Water"" (""Dark Water"" 2006), along with some sequels. These aren't slasher flicks; they're unsettling in the best scary movie tradition: story and creatures stick with you, especially after you turn the lights out. ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" continue to be the best of the bunch.

So what's it all about? Young single-mother and journalist Rachel, played by Naomi Watts in her breakthrough role, investigates a strange video tape. After experiencing a week's worth of escalating terror, viewers die after watching the film. Rachel's child, Aidan (David Dorfman), and the boy's father, photo-journalist Noah (Martin Henderson), are quickly drawn into the Ring's trap and it's up to Rachel to break through old secrets, piecing truth together out of macabre fantasies, in order to save them - and herself.

Well noted for its outstanding, spooky imagery and Rick Baker's masterful effects, ""The Ring"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray. Images are sharp and well defined; skin tones washed in shades of blue and green, look real - and, yes, disturbing. The lossless surround soundtrack is a beaut as well. Rain comes down all around you; phones ring off to the side; sound effects and dialogue come through clearly against an original score by Hans Zimmer. This is a First Class show all the way.

Bonus features entertain and enlighten and are carried over from previous releases. They are: ""Don't Watch This,"" the complete Ring video; ""Rings,"" a nifty after-movie video; cast and filmmaker interviews; and ""The Origin of Terror,"" exploring urban legends.",1335139200,4,2216,5.096418732782369

1405999,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring took lovely Aussie Naomi Watts career from a no name artsy independent film and TV movie actress to an A-list Hollywood celebrity. The film's success also launched the fad of porting more 90's Japanese horror films over for American audiences, unfortunately none of what followed really matched the quality of The Ring or their Japanese counterparts.  Ten years later, and even after a half a dozen viewings The Ring still delivers, even when you know when the scares are about to come it still succeeds in delivering the chills.  Simply put it's textbook suspense and horror done right from the creepy locations, the haunting music and the bizarre video that curses all who watch it with death in 7 days!  This blu-ray release is an excellent catalog transfer both in video and audio, while it's likely to see a wider retail release in the future, if you're a big fan it's definitely worth picking up now at your local Best Buy for $14.99 as undoubtedly it will be the same price when it gets a full release and probably will be the exact same disc minus the pretty cool slip cover.

A few of my other personal Naomi Watts favorites (which never got much press but in my opinon are worth a look)

1406001,5,B000059HCH,"For it's time, ""The Ring"" was probably the best horror movie of all time and is still considered one of the greatest.  You cannot call yourself a horror fan until you've watched this movie because this movie a staple for the horror movie diet.  As a background in case you want to start watching and need a plot that doesn't reveal too much:
Two friends (both girls) start off the movie by having a sleep over, but when they talk about the cursed video tape, one of the girls reveals that in 7 days, you die unless you **** ** and **** ** ** ******* ****, but you'll figure that out towards the end of the movie, anyways because she didn't do that, the girl who watched the video (who's also hosting the sleepover) goes downstairs (her room is in the second floor of the house) to get something, but the TV turns on while she's downstairs so she shuts it off (only static playing), she then proceeded upstairs and when she reaches her room she sees red liquid (assumed to be blood) coming from the crack at the bottom of her bedroom door, she opens her door to see that her TV was turned on and a well was on the TV, she then puts her head up (facing the ceiling) and she dies from the curse.  The girl's cousin and her aunt then delve deeper into what caused her death and what they find is pretty shocking.  The friend from the sleepover was ghost white when found in the closet huddling (which was utterly one of those moments where it shocks you for a few seconds but then you get over it until you finish the movie where it freaks you out at night).
Back to the review, most movies based off of books tend to be better than movies that appeared from thin air because they already have a story line to follow.  Plot and character details are just right so that you don't get too much of the character, but you don't get too little of each character to go off of.  The movie itself was perfect in it's own way, it really depends on how you look at the movie though, some see it as having little to no scary moments or people think it's a little overdone, I can agree that the movie was a bit much (the ring video was a bit too much, but I was only 10 or 12 when I first saw the video and was a bit scared of it), but the ending was just so that it wasn't really a typical American remake with a lot of survivors, but not a J-horror film with no survivors.  Now I cannot just keep going back and forth between good and bad moments because I'm obviously running out of bad moments, but as a last note:  how to avoid the cursed video is revealed so late in the game that there's no way that the girl in the mental ward could have told her how many days she had left because *** ******* ****** *** ****** and ****** ** ** *** ******, which is why part of the movie is flawed!  You think you solved it when really you solve it after the boy reveals something about the curse at the end of the movie!  She ****** *** ****** so early that she didn't need to do anything but **** *** **** and **** ** ** ******** that way ** **** **** **!  I censor out so whoever reads this can watch the movie and not get spoiled here, but you can't solve it until you know what our protagonist did or go to some spoiler review/site that tells you why, but the answer's pretty straight forward.  This movie is a must for Horror movie fans, one of the best Horror movies made to date!",1331251200,,3363,4.125382262996942

1406024,4,B000059HCH,"THE RING is not a slasher flick.  It doesn't thrive on mindless/needless violence and gore.  It doesn't have a cache of other-worldly monsters, ghouls, or zombies.  And it's one of the best horror movies this old geezer has seen in a long, long time.  I had heard from other horror buffs that THE RING is a true spooker; but it wasn't until recently I was able to catch the entire film on cable.

And I never stirred from my couch as I watched.

THE RING works so well because it's effects are entirely cerebral--on the characters as well as the viewers.  A VHS tape with very disturbing images apparently condemns its viewers to a horrid death exactly 7 days after the viewing--a tape paranormally made by an incredibly disturbed girl.  Now that's a premise you can sink your fangs into!  When young journalist Rachel (Naomi Watts is solid) begins investigating the disturbing events surrounding her niece's death, she views the tape herself (and her young psychic son, Aidan, also watches the tape); the plot then becomes a race to solve the events leading up to the making of the video, along with somehow reversing the curse.  So many of the images are disturbing, as we witness (and identify with) Rachel's growing desperation.  Many other horror films are paced and structured accordingly--only to dissolve stupidly in the end; here, while some of the elements are just plain silly (especially when we learn why some viewers are spared), THE RING delivers an ending worthy of all the plot building.  THE RING is tense, eerie, disturbing, troubling, and unsettling; in short, it's what a darn good horror film is supposed to be.

Really, I just love J-Horror's and Asia Extreme. I'm an addict! I don't want to compare The Ring to Ringu though. So, The Ring is the story of Rachel Keller who has to take care of her son, Aidan. Her niece Katie watches a creepy film and receives a phone call saying she has 7 days to live. After 7 days, surprise surprise, she dies! Rachel investigates Katie's death and ends up watching the tape and, like a moron, brings it home where her son watches it. I mean, it's not bad enough that you are going to die in 7 days, but you bring the tape home, to where your child is. Is it not like...some unwritten rule that children are naturally curious...so even if they stumbled upon said tape and you told them to never touch it, they will regardless? So Rachel lets yet another person watch it and then goes on a mission for the next 7 days to figure out how to solve the mystery of the tape and save herself and her son. Although I bitch, and I do it quite frequently, about movie remakes, The Ring is one of my favorites! I loved it and I won't lie, I was freaked out at certain parts. It has a lot of scare factors. And kids are always creepy in movies like 'The Ring'

Gore Verbinski is an amazing director and his job on 'The Ring' was no exception. Most people will probably recognize him from his work on 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. I'm fairly confident he didn't direct The Ring 2 but he did a great job on The Ring. Building up suspense and having scares at all the right times! The acting in The Ring was also excellent! I love Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) so there  is really no surprise that I loved her in this movie! Overall, awesome movie!

No blood and guts here. The chills and thrills lurk within the shadows, unseen and imagined, and far more frightening than the in-your-face stuff of today. The plot moves steadily along, seldom dragging. The atmosphere is foreboding, some scenes are heart-stopping.

The ending however, left me confused and disappointed. It didn't tie up all the important loose ends, such as how did the child make the video...who was making the death warning phone calls...and many other details that, if I posted them, would spoil the movie for those who haven't yet seen it.

And sadly, most current ""horror"" movies lack horror, because it's easier to substitute it with screaming blondes, blood, guts and sharp objects. But ""The Ring"" is soaked in foreboding, creepiness and horrific imagery. Director Gore Verbinski relies heavily on the original Japanese movie for a lot of his remake's flavor, and the result is a slow-building terror that keeps twisting right up to the end.

Single mum Rachel (Naomi Watts) is attending her niece's funeral, after she died under bizarre circumstances. Several of her friends died on the exact same day, at the same time, which (surprise surprise) makes Rachel think this isn't a coincidence. So she investigates the mountain cabin all the kids stayed at a week ago, and finds an unlabeled videotape with a series of bizarre images -- and a curse that will kill you one week afterwards.

She enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) to help her unravel and break the curse. The secret of the tape is wrapped up in a young girl, Samara, who vanished from her adoptive parents' horse farm years ago. Somehow Samara's evil rage has lived in on her curse, and it will destroy Rachel, Noah and their son unless Rachel can find a way to escape it.

Remaking Asian horror movies is one of those movie trends that is hanging on in Hollywood, with everything from ""The Grudge"" to ""The Eye"" to ""Bangkok Dangerous"" getting the A-list Hollywood treatment. Some are good, some are mediocre, most are wretched. But ""The Ring"" was the first of these, adapted from Hideo Nakata's adaptation of Koji Suzuki's novel (cue cries of ""but the original was better). And it achieves the distinction of being almost as atmospheric and haunting as the original.

Most of its brilliance comes from director Gore Verbinski, who thankfully did not simply use the name and concept, and invent a teenybopper plot around that. This is actually rather similar to Nakata's adaptation -- Verbinski alters some few things from the original film, but keeps the same dark, murky atmosphere and many of the same scenes. Even the cinematography has a dark, overcast look, filled with forbidding symbolism -- lots of grey skies and overflowing water. It's as if Samara's influence is permeating everything.

And what about the horror? It comes from the building tension as Rachel's deadline creeps toward us, and brief flashes of Samara's influence -- for example, that poor horse going berserk on a ferry, or the blurred-out faces of the doomed. The entire movie is infused with the feeling that something invisible and ghastly is just waiting to attack you, and it's just waiting for the right moment.

The keystone of this movie is Naomi Watts. This talented actress is virtually perfect as the perpetually worried, perplexed Rachel; as the deadline approaches, her fear and grief are almost palpably overwhelming. Henderson is also good, whether as a flip carefree artist or as a caring ex-boyfriend. Dorfman is the one disappointment -- he seems less like a little boy than a pompous oracle, and he's almost creepier than Samara.

Which is saying something, because Daveigh Chase is utterly chilling as Samara Morgan, a creepy little devil-child with black weedy hair over her face, a white nightgown and ""Omen"" eyes. In keeping with the watery theme of the movie, she always seems vaguely damp.

1406031,3,B000059HCH,"I want to make my review short.

There are over 1,000 reviews of this movie so far, so read those for some really in-depth analysis of the plot.  I just want to talk about a few things.

I generally like this movie.  It's a good story, spooky, suspenseful, dark, and gloomy.  I think the best thing this movie has going for it is the atmosphere.  There is seemingly a never-ending overcast sky for the entire movie.  I think this creates a consistent spooky atmosphere.  The other thing this movie has going for it is that it's scary and suspenseful most of the time.  Naomi Watts?  She's perfect in her role.  Another thing - the music by Hans Zimmer is highly effective and fits in with what is on the screen.  This music is not overpowering.  Instead, it's very low volume, subtle, and delicate.

One thing that just jumped out at me was that this movie borrowed from The Omen (1976 & 2006) and The Changeling (1980).  Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.  Also, the girl with the hair over her eyes who was thrown into the well looks a lot like Regan from The Exorcist (1973) did when she was possessed.

Overall, this is a pretty good flick that I rate at 3 1/2 stars.",1284595200,2,1180,4.339449541284404

1406033,5,B000059HCH,"I may get a lot of flak for calling out `The Mothman Prophesies' for feeling incomplete and then kind of gushing all over `The Ring', but there are some stark differences between the two.  First of all, nothing about `The Ring' feels incomplete.  Incoherent maybe, but never incomplete.  The difference between the two films is that the ambiguous ending crafted and delivered in this particular film feels as though it BELONGS there.  Yes, you will turn off the television screen and ponder to yourself the truth behind the strange ending, but you will never doubt the filmmaker's credibility.  There is a sick sense of closure that develops with `The Ring' that isn't found in `The Mothman Prophesies'.  I think the professing to be `based on factual events' makes `The Mothman Prophesies' more accountable for their flaws.

Reality should make sense, at least that's what the growing public expects.

Okay, now that I got that out of the way, it's time to delve into the depths of `The Ring'.

`The Ring' is basically the story of a woman who is in the throws of panic after her son watches a video that prophesies his death in seven days.  Knowing that she has to do something, even if there is nothing to do, she attempts to solve the mystery of the video (which is responsible for killing her niece).  Naturally, this woman is a reporter and so she serves a better chance at getting to the bottom of things than anyone else would.  Truth be told, the bottom of things is a pretty deep, deep pool (well, if you will) that demands further explanation.

Yes, you will scratch your head a little.

I applaud the film for attempting to explain itself.  The open-ended ending does create a sense of tension that permeates the room even after the film is over.  For this, I actually commend the film.  For everyone seeking further answers, there is much to be said for those contented with the films ambitious attempt at creating an unfathomable mystery.  The origins of the `video' and it's purpose itself remain rather mysterious in texture, but the overall complexities presented in the films conclusion defy anything a simple `explanation' could have afforded us.

I don't want to `know'.

Naomi Watts is a stunning and very capable actress, and I adore her here.  She doesn't raise any bars, because there are none to be raised, but she brings her natural talent to the table in full force, which is always edible.  The real standout here is the ridiculously creepy Daveigh Chase who just sinks her teeth into the role of the `ghost' here.  What she does with a simple stare is beyond nightmare inducing.

She is terrifying.

There are many who claim this film is a preposterous and confusing mess, and there are probably equal amounts who claim it to be supernatural perfection.  I totally buy into the fact that it is confusing, but it is near perfection when you consider the genre and the intensity it is able to build with its ever reaching premise.  When you factor in the visual style, which is magnetic to the sight, you have a film that nails a lot of what makes this genre so special.

It scares the pants off of you.",1279065600,3,3130,4.662408759124087
1406034,4,B000059HCH,"This was a great movie. At first I thought that it might be kind of stupid or geared towards kids, but it held my interest the entire time. Of course, it has a supernatural bent, which stretches the imagination a bit, but for that genre, it was very well done.

The basic plot is that several teenagers watch a strange videotape and within one week, they are all dead. A reporter finds out about this because her babysitter is one of the teenagers who died. She and her estranged husband investigate the suspicious deaths.

The story moves quickly, the acting is good, and I imagine that watching it at night with the lights out would be creepy. Lots of fun and I liked it.",1275955200,,673,4.419354838709677
1406035,5,B000059HCH,"This did inspire the current remake craze, but watching the movie, you can see why. It's smart, expertly crafted, tense, beautiful, and damn good storytelling. You care about these characters, and the director knew how to scare you. I can't recommend it enough. Even having seen the original Japanese film first, I think this movie is far superior. While Ringu was also well done, it had some flaws such as *spoilers* the ending where she's taking the tape to her dad to have him watch it. Isn't there anybody else who could see it? You're really going to get your own father killed? And then there's the way you get information in the original... through her psychic ex-husband (something they did away with in the remake). You also have the fade to black and white when somebody dies, which just seems like the filmmaker didn't know what else to do. *end spoilers* The Ring really shows Naomi's character as a reporter, uncovering clues and piecing together the mystery. It draws you in and keeps the story moving at just the right pace. The movie's atmosphere is incredible. It's extremely creepy and gets under your skin. When the last frightening scene rolls around, you'll definitely be on edge.

The DVD really has nothing worthwhile in terms of special features, which is very disappointing. The movie is so good though that you should buy it anyway, and you should try to track down the Rings short film that they put out with this. It's also amazing.

It keeps everything that made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringu</a>&nbsp;good, but benefits from some added angles, better special effects, and deeper characterization on some of the supporting players.  Also, it's not a shot-by-shot remake: in several instances backstory elements have been substitued for an alternate take on things.  In this case, both the original and the remake had equally cool takes on the backstory.  But I've always felt that if you're going to do a remake you just have to do Some things differently so it actually Is a different take on the same idea, not just a reshooting of the exact same movie.  The Ring differentiated itself enough so that you'll want to watch both versions, and enjoy not only the same theme but the differences here and there.  [Note - there's also a third version,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring-Virus/dp/B000929VS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring Virus</a>, a Korean remake of Ringu that came out, I believe, before the American remake.  I've really got to get on the ball and see that one too.)

  The basic premise behind The Ring is now one of the best known set-ups in horror: there's a videotape out there, of unknown origin, and everyone who watches it dies exactly seven days later.  In addition, immediately after watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call as a warning of their fate.  You never hear exactly what's said on the call, but you can just make out enough of it that, by that and the reaction of the person receiving the call (this is one of the things that really made The Ring so great - the tremendous jobs various performers did in reacting to things that aren't fully shown on screen) it really brings an instant air of sinister otherworldliness.  Naomi Watts plays the reporter who investigates this strange urban legend after four kids die after watching the tape - one of them her niece - and eventually comes into possession of the tape itself.  Totally disbelieving of any truth to the supernatural legend, she nonetheless watches the tape, looking for possible clues.  And proceeds to receive the phone call that all viewers are said to receive.  It quickly becomes impossible to discount anything about the legend, and worse still, Watts is horrified to get up one morning and find her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) innocently watching the video he found.  Now it's a race against time to track down the origins of the tape and try to stop the curse before it reaches its fated conclusion.  The trail leads to the story of a little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase), now dead several years...

  The Ring is a multi-layered horror story that gets scarier and scarier as it unfolds, riveting from the start but leaving the biggest and most memorable frights for the end stages.  The visual imagery of The Ring has become iconic in horrordom, including the stone well, first seen on the videotape itself, and the climax is a masterpiece.  Outstanding performances all around.

It starts off being what I thought to be a typical killer stalks kids kind of a thing.  Some kids watch a video and end up a few days later disfigured and dead.  If you know nothing about the movie and like scary flicks, don't finish reading this review and never read any review.  Just watch the thing alone and at night...at 2 in the morning would be good.

I thought this movie ranks up there with The Exorcist and Psycho.  This is truly a horror classic.  Now, that being said, I've seen reviews in which people have felt it being ""a typical horror movie"" and not all that scary.  Of course, I also know people that thought The Exorcist was campy and good for a laugh.  For me, though, there was tension through out the whole movie, which kept building and building, and I nearly wet myself during THE scene.

I'll admit I happened to watch this thing at about 2 in the morning and was, as I stated, unaware of the good reviews this thing had.

Ringu had a much more creepy feel to it. It wasn't overdone at all, it left much more to the imagination, and was much more dramatic than The Ring (like, for example, in Ringu, when the protagonist answers the phone, she hears the same sounds heard on the tape, and slams the phone down, while in The Ring, a cliche' voice says, ""You have seven days"" and then she just puts the phone down; the faces of the victims are scarier in Ringu, partly because they're not clearly overdone makeup). The tape in The Ring was too long and seemed like someone just randomly put together a sequence just for shock value, while in Ringu it was short and sweet, was genuinely creepy, and it looked like something that could have come from beyond the grave. To be really honest, I got kind of bored with the tape in The Ring.

The boy in Ringu also has a much creepier feel about him, the fact that he almost never opens his mouth adds to the creepiness of the whole movie, while in The Ring he seems to be a pretty major character and talks quite a lot, which detracted.

The one nice thing in The Ring was the sequence with the horse running through the ferry, but that had to be spoiled (by the way, there's no way that ever happened, because it's common knowledge not to start instigating a horse in a trailer).

There are two main issues with The Ring: (1) You kind of don't care if the whole cast lives or dies, while in Ringu one was very much routing for the protagonist, her son, and even her ex-husband, and (2) The Ring relies heavily on shock value and drags when there isn't any shock value, while Ringu just creeped under your skin and didn't drive it into the ground.",1247529600,,1824,4.309037900874635

The American remake is pretty good, but the silent eeriness that's constant in the original works more for me rather than the high-voltage ""jump"" effects. Plus, eighteen-year old Sadako is much scarier than ten-year old Samara. But performance-wise, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson are more believable. Plus, Brian Cox is in the film, so it brings my grade up a notch. Finally, there's the cursed videotape. The longer American version is all for disturbing images and shrieking sound effects, while the original is only forty seconds long and contains only one scary image. I do believe I like the tapes equally (though I definitely wouldn't want to die in seven days when I watch them).

All in all, The American Ring works for its shock effects and its horrifying climax. I just prefer the original Japanese Ring for its silent eeriness and steady pacing.

I saw Ringu and found it rather absurd (and not intentionally), and not much in the way of frightening, either. Sometimes bigger budget films do get it right. The Ring is one of them.",1224979200,3,865,4.697368421052632
1406060,5,B000059HCH,"I watched this film because I thought it was another I had seen several years ago. It wasn't. ""The Ring"" is much more. Another reviewer called it a cerebral exercise in terror. Exactly! What could have been so hokey became excellent frisson (that thrilling moment that makes your hair prickle).

First, the premise: An urban legend that watching this particular video, receiving a phone call immediately after watching will cause your death in exactly seven days. Don't we pooh-pooh urban legends? ""The Ring"" makes us consider their validity.

Second, the video itself. Where did it come from? Who made it? How? Why? So many questions, none answered, ever.

Third, again the video. What do the scenes represent? The strange, surreal images?

That brings in Naomi Watts' character, a reporter doubly bound in the story, first through her son, not unlike the boy in ""The Sixth Sense"" with his sixth sense for the supernatural. Aiden is definitely attuned to the other world.

Secondly, Rachal is bound to the story through her research. Her niece watched the movie and died horribly seven days later. Rachal first watches the tape, then begins investigating the images. One by one she peels off the layers of this gothic mystery/puzzle/freakshow.

Rachal's appearance in the movie parallels the changes with the story. At the beginning she is frankly beautiful, cool and assured. As revelations unfold and she begins to experience frisson, she begins a shift in appearance, becoming rumpled. By movie's end she is almost gray, as if psychologically preparing to join the urban legend dead.

The viewer's frisson builds. The ending is a nightmare. ""The Ring"" is definitely a cerebral experience in terror.

SPOILER ALERT:
One of those fast flashes of film reveals this: ""Live birth."" An intriguing bit of information that many viewers and reviewers missed or I misinterpreted. It explains better what happens at the well between Anna and Samara.

A definite see-again movie!!

The story is about a supposed cursed video tape that if watched results in a phone call in where a young girl tells you that in seven days you will die. We see this happen in the opening part of the film. One of the victims is the niece of Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts) who because of the request of her sister digs deeper into the mystery of four young teens who die in mysterious ways all exactly at the same time. The same four friends who watched the video together exactly one week earlier. Her young son, superbly played by David Dorfman and ex boyfriend (Kiwi Martin Henderson) are drawn into the mystery as well. She soon realises she must solve the origins of the tape quickly as she herself recieved the same phone call straight after viewing the cursed tape. Full of some shocking moments and great horror the film has you gripped from beginning to end with one of the most shocking and freaky endings ive seen in a long time..you will never feel the same about your t.v again!

1406083,3,B000059HCH,"This is not a particularly scary movie, but it is kind of fun to watch.  I sort of got interested in following the heroine's quest to find out the history of the supposedly lethal video tape.  The story started unraveling, and the pieces of the puzzle started coming together in an intriguing way.  It was almost starting to make sense.  The plot began to look like it would make sense with an intelligent path through some twists and turns to a definite conclusion.  It wasn't too scary, but it was fun.  Then it looked like the movie was just about to end...but it didn't!  Suddenly, the last 5 minutes or so, it finally started getting scary...and then it hit you with a confusing end that made you sit there and say, ""What the hell was that???""  There were moments where I almost thought that this could end up being a 4-star flick...but nothing really materialized, and the ending just killed it.  This was a decent movie with a lot of shortcomings...not too scary, but it was a fun watch.  I recommend: Rent it!  It'll be fun to watch once or twice.  There will be a few brief moments of fright, but not many.  It's an okay fun story.  Don't get too bothered by the fact that the ending makes no sense.

1406084,4,B000059HCH,"(3.5 *'s) Nearly into the first thirty-five minutes of `The Ring' I got so many jolts, I nearly turned the DVD off.  Popular, and often revered by horror fans, the film renders a favorably mixed bag.  Conceptually it frightens and fascinates even if its premise is hokey, and there are many rules of thumb that are broken or inconsistent.  Still, I was glad to take the journey.  If the goal of a horror movie is to scare and tell a story, then the film truly has the goods to deliver.

The movie is nearly universal, so I'll be brief:  Two teenage girls, Katie Embry and Becca Kotler, are sharing the tale of a video that once seen will be followed by a threatening phone call announcing the viewer has but one week to live.  The girls are playing it out as a ghost story as they jive and enthuse one another, but on every other turn each becomes serious until one girl gets the phone call.  There are many false alarms that work effectively, but once we're in, there's no turning back.

A short time later, the death sentence has turned out to be true and the haunted vision comes upon those who have viewed the videotape.  Anyone would pass it off except all the teenagers associated with it stayed at a cabin with the tape turn up dead.

Naturally, believing it or not requires investigation, so Katie's aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is every bit willing and ready as she tries to tie together who or what caused her niece's death.  Her own son, Aidan (David Dorfman) is much like Cole in `The Sixth Sense,' and his own supernatural take on dreams and drawings gives us more of an eerie feeling about the whole affair.  Her loved one (Martin Henderson) is drawn into the sleuthing mission, but his skepticism does much for the film's tension.

`The Ring' is a carefully crafted full-length `Twilight Zone' or `Night Gallery' adventure.  There was one episode of the latter where a ""Nutcracker"" curse was brought upon its recipients, but that was shorter with rules that seemed to work better.  Much of the credibility comes from the videotape itself, which would win in an art exhibition and brings much atmosphere to the movie, but it stretches belief a bit.  (Sprinkling clues to bring participants to the truth of a mystery--why not leave a straightforward message?  This is answered partly in the movie, but not well enough.)

As a story it works.  It does have a mystery to unveil, and mostly it is a satisfying tale of tragedy, but I do have some complaints about the ending.  Without revealing the store, there's a scene played out near the fireplace that brings some question as to the rules being broken near the end.  The ending is meant to be a chilling resolution, but unintentionally the fireplace scene shows that the powers that be can be manipulated.  Let's just say I see a way out of the curse that the ending doesn't seem to indicate.

(Based on a novel by Japanese author Koji Suzuki and an original Japanese movie.  Directed by Gore Verbinski.)

1406085,4,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is a modern gothic masterpiece that is genuinely horrifying and creepy.  Like the shower scene is ""Psycho,"" ""The Ring"" contains one of the most bizarre scenes in cinematic history that will never be forgotten:  When the dripping wet ghost of Samara climbs out of the television.  The atmosphere throughout the movie is dark, dank and depressing.  Leaves are changing, cold wind is blowing, and rain is pelting.

  Naomi Watts is great as the beautiful, young journalist who is investigating the strange VHS tape that has killed her niece and everyone else who has watched it.  She scrambles to uncover its secrets before her and her son become the next victims.

  ""The Ring"" is a good, clean scare that will continue to chill you long after the television is turned off.  I would love to see a director`s cut of this movie.

Starting out with creepy black & white video images the film soon builds thick and eerie atmosphere and also succeeds in giving the viewer quite an early scare. The gradually unfolding story is absorbing, constantly thrilling and splendidly supported by fine actors, an eerie soundtrack and visually stunning shots. More frightening scenes are to follow before the film concludes with an unusual and disturbing ending.

1406088,4,B000059HCH,"I love horror films and have seen many, new and old. However, none have affected me so much as The Ring. Not the Omen, not Excorsist, not The Shining. Those films have nothing on the creepiness that this film possesses. Now, I have not seen the original, but I hear from different people that they find that one better, and some, find the remake better. I guess it doesn't really matter. They are probably both pretty intense. Naomi Watts does a fantastic job as a petrified woman trying to stop something horrible from happening. Of course, she doesn't realise what that entails. The look of the film is one of foreboding. At every turn, in every scene. It must be the hue, its this murky bluish grey, and it surrounds the entire film. You never know what to expect. The beginning of the film is awesome, and the end is the most disturbing, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I cannot look at a well the same way anymore. The infamous tape that is in the movie, while not really scary, it is pretty disturbing. I think the soundtrack has something to do with that as well. Whoever scored the film did a great job in setting the atmosphere.  I still would not really categorize this as a horror film. Its more of a suspense thriller. When I think of horror, I think of a slasher film like Nightmare on Elm St or the Jason films. The Ring is on a completely different level. Though it freaked me out, I still loved it, and have actually seen it more than once.",1202688000,7,1456,4.392592592592592
1406089,4,B000059HCH,"This is not a slasher flick, gore movie, or anything typical, really. It's best classified as psychological horror. There are no monsters, things that jump out at you, or any cliched horror movie staples. Rather, the horror comes from the subtle yet disturbing imagery throughout the film, especially on the Tape. This is a thinking person's horror movie, and tells its story through hints, both visual and in the screenplay.

As you know by now, the plot revolves around a mysterious videotape that somehow results in your demise exactly 7 days after being seen. The central character is a reporter, excellently portrayed by Naomi Watts, who investigates the source of this killer tape after her niece becomes a victim. Naomi follows the clues on the tape like a modern day Nancy Drew and is led to a spooky island that is obviously the one shown on the tape. From there, she meets a strange family with a bunch of sinister secrets that are revealed to us one by one. The mystery element is very effective, and keeps you involved in the story. The conclusion clearly leaves room for a sequel, which has obviously already been made.

The acting is excellent, as is the writing. The story is set in the Pacific northwest, and I'm not sure if it was filmed there, but wherever it was filmed is gloomy, rainy, and adds perfectly to the atmosphere of the movie.
In short, very well-done, engaging, enjoyable, and also disturbing.",1202256000,3,1425,4.765182186234818

1406092,3,B000059HCH,"The Ring Part One does have some action at the very beginning of the movie. However, the storyline was unclear regarding the relationships between the characters. For example, the little boy in the film called his mom by her first name instead of calling her mom. I was confused about their relationship. Was he her young brother, her nephew, or did he have a bad relationship toward his mother? The movie offered no clear explanation why the little boy called his mother by her first name.

The movie also offered no explanation why the girl in the well wants to continue her haunting and killing spree. Perhaps, The Ring part two will give the movie audience a clear answer to that question.
Also, the movie was slow with no action for over 40 minutes that the director and producer should have shortened to maybe 10-15 minutes.
I feel that characters were not developed enough so that the audience could easily understand the little boy's odd behavior or the past relationship between the mother and her male friend.
Hopefully, part two will clear up the confusion that part one's storyline contained.
This movie was not horrible. The actors were decent. One familiar face is in the movie's opening scene. She was also in the Grude part 1 & 2 as the sister of Sarah Michelle Gellar.
This movie is similiar to the Grudge because of the scary spirit that's in the form of a murdered little girl.

the movie's undoing is unfortunately the LAST TEN MINUTES, when it seems as though another director takes over, all art and pacing and everything is sacrificed for tying it all up very neatly. and i'm sorry but it was lost on all fronts when the little girl climbed out of the tv... the movie was inside my head, it had all it's hooks in, and then it turned out a cheap trick like that? ew.
i love a movie that creeps in with an outrageous story, but presents it in such a way that you start to believe it... but that girl coming out of the tv! nyeeerggh...
if you are a fan of pure psychological horror/thrillers, you will go crazy over the first part, and the last bit will disappoint. if you love to be shocked by a fast paced disturbing horror movie, this film has a few jarring cuts, but not enough to please and the slow pace will likely drive you crazy instead.
personally i wish i could have seen what it would have looked like had hollywood (or japan, i guess) not stepped in with cheap gimmicks and special effects, if it had kept with the exquisite slowly-building-dread feeling and not been so efficiently explained. i think it might have been truly epic.",1187654400,3,1733,4.41875
1406105,4,B000059HCH,"This is an American version of a Japanese film based upon a comic.  Unlike The Grudge, which was directed by the same director as the Japanese version, this is a very different story from the Japanese (although there is a quick reference to the Japanese version).

There is a rumor of a videotape that can kill people.  If you watch it you will get a phone call and be told you will die in seven days.  When a reporter's niece dies the reporter starts to look into the story.  First she finds out her niece had a secret boyfriend.  Then she finds out the boyfriend died at the same moment as the niece.  There is definitely something strange going on.  As the reporter digs through the story she discovers others died at the same time.  Then she learns about, and finds, the videotape.  She watches it before believing it.

But soon the reporter does believe, but not before showing it to her ex.  She starts to become frantic with trying to find a way to break the curse and that means learning more about it.  But when her son watches the videotape she really begins to panic.  Now she not only has to solve the mystery for herself, but for her son.  Her son seems to have some connection to the video and its images and it somehow revolves around a young girl.  It becomes a race against time and the reporter finds a way she thinks will stop the curse.  Will she succeed?  Will she save the ones she loves?  Watch and find out.

The videotape in Ringu makes more sense to me than the one here but the story has been rewritten in such a way as to make it work.  Here we have a film that kept the core of the original (the videotape, the ring, and the force behind the curse) and recrafted it into more than just an adaptation.

1406112,5,B000059HCH,"A remake of a Japanese film titled Ringu (1998), which I have yet to see, The Ring (2002) is a genuinely creepy tale of a cursed video, one that results in the death of anyone, within seven days, who happens to watch it...directed by Gore Verbinski, who's found a lot of success with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the film stars Naomi Watts (Ned Kelly, King Kong) as an investigative reporter who comes across the aforementioned tape after a relative dies mysteriously.  Also appearing is Martin Henderson (Smokin' Aces), David Dorfman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Jane Alexander (The Cider House Rules), Daveigh Chase (Stitch! The Movie), and Brian Cox (The Bourne Identity, X2).

As the movie, set in the Seattle area, begins we see two teenage girls alone in a large house, and soon their conversation turns to the stuff urban legends are made of, specifically in terms of the existence of a video tape that, when watched, will result in a creepy phone call stating the viewer has seven days to live.  As it turns out, one of the girls just happened to have watch said tape a week ago and, well, I won't describe anymore but I will say some seriously bad mojo soon ensues as the girl who watched the tape has her chips prematurely cashed in while her friend suffers a complete mental collapse resulting her being institutionalized.  So how does Naomi Watts, who plays the character Rachel Keller, fit into it all?  Well, she just happens to be the aunt of the dead girl, along with also being an investigative reporter and a single mother of a creepy little kid named Aidan (Dorfman).  Realizing there may be a story here, especially after learning a few of her niece's friends died mysterious the same time as the girl (they all watched the tape at the same time), Rachel begins digging, eventually coming across the tape (and watching it), and soon begins to fear for her own life, with good reason.  Hoping to learn more about the images on the video, she contacts an acquaintance named Noah (Henderson), who specializes in graphic mediums, and shows him the tape (apparently it wasn't enough that she alone be cursed).  Noah's skeptical, believing it's some sort of crummy, student film but soon changes his tune as the strange vibes Rachel has been experiencing since watching the tape begin to invade his reality.  Rachel's research eventually leads her and Noah upstate to a dilapidated horse farm (that has no horses), run by a man named Richard Morgan (Cox), whose wife and daughter, both featured prominently on the tape, have since died under mysterious circumstances (seems the wife was a bit nutty, while the daughter was, well...).  Anyway, Rachel and Noah make some important revelations, ones that may help remove the `curse', that is if they don't run out of time (seven days goes by quickly when you've got the monkey of death on your back).

I avoided seeing this when it originally came out, as there was so much buzz flying about, and for some reason I thought the film would be swathed in pretension.  I finally did watch it about a year and a half ago, and then again last night, and after doing so, I was very impressed.  I definitely believe this is a film in need of multiple viewings, at least for me, as the first time I saw it my focus was primarily on the ookie visuals, so much so I missed bits and pieces of the story.  Subsequently, by the end of the first go around, I wasn't entirely sure what the hell was going on, specifically in terms of the ending.  Now, in watching again last night, I tended to focus more on the story, picking up those minor, but important, elements I missed the first time around, and things made a whole lot more sense...not that I didn't feel there wasn't a plot hole or two, but nothing large enough to drive a bus through.  The story has an ever present sense of doom and gloom, partly due to the Seattle setting (Seattle is notorious for its wet weather), but also because of the material itself as I never really got the impression that even if Rachel could solve the mystery, she'd rid herself of the curse.  Also it should be known that none of the characters are particularly pleasant as Rachel, a single, working mother, at least initially, seemed more focused on her career than her son, and Noah, whose role I purposely left ambiguous, came off as a complete a-hole (check out the scene with Noah and Aidan in the car and you'll see what I mean).  Even the kid Aidan came off all creepy and such, especially when referring to his mother by her name rather than calling her `mom'.  Despite my being put off by these characters none really seemed deserving of the fate they were destined for, so I did find myself interested in their relative well being (Rachel's attitudes change slightly as the story moves along, but I'm still unsure if it was due to a mother's love or her own sense of self preservation), except for maybe Noah.  While I may not have liked the characters all that much, I thought the performances were well done, and the direction taut and engaging.  The pacing was solid and even, as the story never really got tiresome or boring.  I did like the twists at the end, one of which involved Noah and provided for one of the more memorable and disturbing visuals in the film.  All in all I thought this a very well made, nightmarish affair, one worth watching at least twice of only to pick up on that which may have been missed the first time around.  As far as those who've seen the film, was I the only one who found that fingernail bit within the cursed video extremely uncomfortable to watch?  That's a pain that will linger...

The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), comes across very well, and the audio, available in DTS 5.1 Surround (English), Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (English and French), and Dolby Surround 2.0 (English), is strong and clear.  Extras, which aren't much, include subtitles in English, Spanish, and French, a short film by Gore Verbinski, one that apparently utilizes footage shot but not used in the final release of the film, and trailers for Ringu (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and 8 Mile (2002).  Also included, as a slightly hidden feature, is a complete showing of the material present on the `cursed' tape, which last roughly two minutes, if you dare...

By the way, in case you're interested, a sequel entitled The Ring Two (2005) was released, directed by Hideo Nakata, who directed the original Ringu (1998), and there's talks of a third film, titled aptly enough The Ring 3, possibly to be released in 2008.",1168819200,2,6587,4.648578811369509

1406124,5,B000059HCH,"I know there will be some misguided souls who stumble into a showing of THE RING believing that it's either a film of Richard Wagner's famous operatic cycle, or has something to do with Hobbits. Needless to say, they will be in for a surprise.

Gore Verbinski's THE RING, based on an extremely popular Japanese film and novel, is a creepy and disturbing thriller that may do for VCRs what JAWS did for the ocean. After watching a recent sneak preview, I couldn't help but imagine people all across the nation going home and throwing out their videocassettes and players, in fear that they might accidentally watch the tape that's at the center of this movie.

The fast-paced suspense film begins in Seattle with an urban legend-type set up: two high school girls - Katie and Becca - are alone in Katie's home at night. Conversation turns to a videotape that has a horrifying effect. Moments after you watch it, the phone rings, and a voice tells you, ""Seven days."" And exactly a week later, you die. Katie reveals to her friend that she watched that tape at a cabin in the woods, seven days before. In a brilliantly edited sequence that is sure to make you drop your popcorn, Katie meets her fate, and we learn that the tale of the tape is no mere kids' story.

Katie's aunt, a newspaper reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts), is asked by her sister Ruth (Lindsay Frost) to investigate the death, and she soon finds herself drawn into a world that's as dark and claustrophobic as the grave. Pulled in with her are former boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson), and their son Aidan (David Dorfman).

We see the tape in question early on, and at first it appears to be just a random series of weird images - a ring of light that looks like a solar eclipse, dead horses floating in water, a woman leaping from a cliff, a fly buzzing, a stone wall that encloses a well - playing out like a home movie made by David Lynch and Luis Buuel. As the film progresses, however, we learn that the eerie black-and-white vignettes are clues to who made the tape and why. I'd hate to give away too much, so I'll just say that the answer takes Noah and Rachel to an island where a horse breeder (marvelously played by Brian Cox, the original and best Hannibal Lecter) seems to be hiding a secret that's by turns sad, and horrifying.

The acting in THE RING is fabulous throughout, with the actors stretching well beyond the caricatures all-too-often found in horror films and creating realistic, intriguing people. Here she (Naomi Watts) proves once again that she's an outstanding actress. Martin Henderson, another actor from Down Under, is perfect as a videographer turned reluctant action hero, and young David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are scary-good. Amber Tamblyn (daughter of multitalented actor/singer/dancer Russ Tamblyn) and the engaging Rachael Bella do a wonderful job of starting the movie off with a scream, Lindsay Frost shines in a small but important role, and Jane Alexander (an actor's actor) is fun to watch as a doctor who knows more than she wants to. The direction is crisp, stylish, and sure-handed (hard to believe that this is the same guy who helmed MOUSE TRAP and THE MEXICAN). Even the lighting and sound are beautifully worked out; those elements make a sequence with a horse on a ferry especially chilling. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack hits all the right notes, and the screenplay is smart, original, and pulls no punches. It's worth noting that unlike most modern horror films, you won't see people terrorized with knives or other conventional weapons, and there's very little actual gore. What you do see, however, as well as what's implied, may give you the worst case of the creeps you've ever had. I'm sure that some purists who've seen the original Japanese film (which spawned sequels and a TV series) will pick apart this version, but, for my money, this is one case where the remake of a foreign film can stand on its own merits.

If you love being scared, grab a hold of Verbinski's THE RING and hang on for the ride of your life.",1161043200,7,4044,4.672752808988764
1406125,5,B000059HCH,"The reason I believe the Ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a VERY personal, unexplainable level.  You see, the main storyline of the Ring is the fact that this video tape has been created, and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual, twisted manner.  It's up to a reporter woman named Rachel to figure everything out.  She's the main character of the film, along with her son.

As I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain.  First of all, the entire film is very effectively well-done the way everything is dark and damp and, for lack of better words, SCARY!

The one thing I remembered after watching the Ring are some of the things that were on that video tape.  The mirror on the wall, and the location of the ladder are two things I could have SWORN I've seen somewhere before, like a childhood memory I can't figure out.  Like I've been SOMEWHERE and seen those things before.  Like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003, and I believe I've actually SEEN the footage on that video tape many years ago *somewhere* because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked *incredibly* familiar.  I can't explain what it is but this is the main reason I find the movie so delightful.",1161043200,3,1335,4.5020746887966805
1406126,4,B000059HCH,"The Ring is that rare animal, a remake that actually manages to be as good as the original, although there are differences between the two films.

The plot concerns a mysterious video tape which once played, seems to bring about the death of the viewer shortly afterwards. The victims appear to have been literally terrified to death, and investigating this phenomenon is reporter - Naomi Watts. Before long she and her child are in terrible danger, and she faces a frantic race against time to solve this terrifying mystery.

Putting together snippets of the images available on the tape, Watts eventually tracks down the source but the discovery is a horrifying one...

This film contains real suspense and genuine moments of fear. There is also very little gore, instead the film's delivery is via its shock value, and in this it succeeds very well. Naomi Watts turns in a strong performance and has a strong cast with her, including actors like Brian Cox who mirror Watts' with strong performances of their own. Add to this some genuinely frightening scenes, and you have a great movie for Halloween viewing.

Taken as a whole, this is a high calibre horror film and is recommended to anyone who is a fan of the genre or who just wants a good, scary film to watch.",1160697600,4,1268,4.723981900452489

1406128,4,B000059HCH,"If you've read any of my past reviews you already know of my endless anger and disgust over Hollywood's recent pattern of remaking already done horror movies. And please don't mistake me, it's not so much i mind remakes but if you are going to take the time to do so, lets at least try and make it better than the original (i.e. KING KONG is an example where this succeeded, and yes i know King Kong isn't horror but you get the point).

Long has it been accepted that for a horror movie to work, it simply MUST BE rated 'R'. Rare is the occasion where a PG or PG-13 will generate more than a small tremor from most; and to be honest the only PG rated horror movie that ever left a lasting effect on me (before viewing this one of course) was Poltergeist. Hell, now that i think of it, never since Poltergeist has there been a movie that made people want to turn their TV's off and do something else more constructive instead (especially when a snowy screen comes on).

I don't know what it is about a demonic little girl that gives me (and many others id suppose) the Willie's, but we have got to get this girl (Samara) and Regan (the little girl from The Exorcist) in a room together.

I must admit this movie floored me in that it had almost no blood, little violence, no decapitations, stabbings, or scary chase scenes and the traditional gore, that one often feels makes horror ...well........ horror. The movie gets you with disturbing imagery and the most frightful tool that can be utilized (that sadly few producers use these days)... your own imagination. It's free and works better than all the digital imagery and special effects anyone could ever muster.

I won't go into too much, so as to not ruin it for you. The movie is about a video that when watched will lead to your eventual demise 7 days later. The most disturbing aspect of this is when one takes a second to think...'ya know something this video that allegedly has the effect of leaving it's viewer dead is the exact movie I'm watching on video right now...... I wonder if......?'

Yea,yea, i know...it's pretty far fetched.. still it plays with ones imagination, makes you think, and holds your attention unlike most horror movies these days. So if you're like i was, assuming that a PG rating for a horror movie meant few scares, and that remakes can't be better than the original... Id advise you take a chance on THE RING it might just prove you wrong as it did me.

P.S. ya might want to take the phone off the hook when watching.. some 'RINGS' can scare you to DEATH.

P.S. II don't bother with the movie extras, they aren't worth the time.",1158192000,3,2621,4.4365904365904365
1406129,5,B000059HCH,"A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible. ""The Ring"" gives you all this and more.

This film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know, that likely exists in our own home. We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked. The horror that finds us sounds much like an urban legend. Watch a mysterious, bizarre videotape that causes fear in some, and others to scoff at its amateurish style and technique. Moments after watching the videotape, the phone rings and a voice says, ""seven days."" Seven days later the watcher of the video dies with a most horrible expression of fear on their face.

Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) learns of this urban legend when her niece dies in a most disconcerting way, and a friend who was with her becomes insane. Rachel tries to back track recent events that happened to her niece and friend and discovers an unlabeled videotape in a remote mountain lodge. Not yet believing the urban legend, Rachel watches the videotape. The phone rings, and the fear begins.

Soon joining Rachel are her ex-husband Aidan (David Dorfman), and even more frighteningly, her son. Hoping that the story isn't true, yet knowing she cannot wait for the end, Rachel begins following the clues in the video to determine whether there is a way of keeping from dying. We discover, with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together, that every image in the movie has meaning.

The ending of the movie was a bit of a let-down, and yet almost as creepy as the movie itself. As with many movies, especially horror movies, the ending can make or break a movie and the ending of this movie almost undoes all the excellence of the movie's body.

This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen and the best I've seen recently. Elements of the movie are similar to ""Fear Dot Com,"" which was also chilling and bloodier, but not as creepy and ominous as ""The Ring."" I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout. Horror movies always play better when ambiance and a growing sense of fear win out over the splatter of unnecessary and excessive blood.",1156982400,,2317,4.683046683046683

1406132,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring, DreamWorks' 2002 U.S. remake of Asmik ACE Entertainment's 1998 Japanese thriller, Ringu, based on author Koji Suzuki's bestselling novel, Ring ([1991], 2003), merits, without equivocation, its surprise-hit status.

Airing her hatred of television to high school compatriot Becca Kottler (Rachael Bella), The Ring opens in Katie Embry's (Amber Tamblyn) protected, upscale suburban Seattle home. Mulling the neurological effects of electromagnetic transmissions, she accuses big business of conspiring to keep the public in the dark. Becca asks Katie if she knows anything about the mysterious videotape that has surfaced at rival Revere High, its harrowing images purportedly invoking the horrid deaths of unmindful viewers ""seven days"" after receiving an eerie phone call from a whispering, young girl. Katie admits she and her Revere boyfriend, Josh, and another young couple, saw the macabre recording in place of the football game they planned to watch during their recent rendezvous at nearby Shelter Mountain Inn. Fulfilling the urban myth, Katie clutches her throat, feigning suffocation, which unhinges Becca. Moments later, at 10 PM, Katie IS dead! Curled-up in her closet with mouth agape, putrid and soaking wet, she resembles the tormented soul in Edvard Munch's infamous masterpiece, The Scream.

As a psychological thriller, The Ring plumbs the murky depths of psyches wracked by loss and broken relationships. Katie's untimely death devastates the Embry's and haunts their perceptive, six-year old-nephew, Aidan Keller (David Dorfman), who adored his older cousin. Unsatisfied with the official cause of death of heart failure, Ruth Embry (Lindsay Frost) asks her younger sister, Rachel (Naomi Watts), with whom Katie bonded, to investigate. Heading a single parent household after her separation from Noah Clay (Martin Henderson), Rachel Keller supports her son, Aidan, as a journalist with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. At Katie's wake, she discovers Josh died on the same night and time as Katie, apparently of suicide, allegedly jumping-off a high-rise building. At work, Rachel learns the pair's trysting cohorts perished on the same night and time, exactly one week after viewing the accursed videotape.

Aidan's disturbed drawings of frocked, young girls buried underground, floating underwater, and entombed in rocket ships has alarmed his teacher (Sandra Thigpen) who informs Rachel of the matter after the latter arrives late from work to pick up her son at school. Rachel shrugs-off his teacher's concern, resolving Aidan's sketches depict his deceased cousin, Katie. Determining the illustrations predate Katie's death by several days, Aidan's teacher intimates he may be communicating something else. The innuendo infuriates Rachel, but raises her consciousness as well.

At its core, The Ring revolves around the murder of a paranormally gifted child, Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase), a ghostly sprite in the Dickensian tradition, left for dead in a well, eternally doomed to a watery purgatory. Subjected to failed adoptions and heartless institutionalization, Samara is everyone's child whose life is tragically cut short, abandoned, abused, neglected, and denied of loving natural and adoptive parents--especially caring mothers. In death, Samara seeks to return in resonate surrogates, finding them in Aidan and his journalist mom. Samara has a story to tell. She voices it subconsciously in dreams and subliminally with nensha (thoughtography), enabling her to telepathically ""burn"" ethereal images of herself and her impressions into mind and media, such as videotape, and telekinetically manipulate matter. If Samara haunts those who, in complacency, blindly turn away from her, or callously trivialize her plight, then those who are unable or unwilling to fathom her videotape will, after a week, summon her corrupt Cabalistic twin, a virulent, festering, demon who effortlessly conjures death by encircling its victims in an otherworldly tsunami. Rachel, who is consumed with saving her son's life, as an unintended viewer of the videotape, more than her own life, or that of her estranged partner, Noah, whose support she sought as a media expert, emerges from Samara's philosopher's stone well as a sentient sentinel.

Not since Alfred Hitchcock's inspirational adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's The Birds (1963) has a film so influentially ascribed the esoteric role of consciousness-raising to a spiritually enlightened, capable female lead character, separating it from dronish portrayals in more banal slasher-hacker features. Like Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), Rachel Keller is a harbinger of change, encountering, at best, reticence in an asylum confined Becca, and self-absorption in the Morgan's family physician, Dr. Grasnik (Jane Alexander), who is oblivious to Samara's fate. At worst, Rachel faces overt hostility in Samara's morose and physically abusive, adoptive father, Richard Morgan (Brian Cox). Thanks to producers, Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes, screenwriters, Hiroshi Takahashi and Ehren Kruger, and director, Gore Verbinski for advancing the Master's torch; to Hans Zimmer for his memorable, haunting score; and, finally, to Naomi Watts, who follows her breakthrough performance in Mulholland Drive in breathtaking fashion as a distraught mother and tenacious seeker of truth, making us believers.

With each passing day, Samara broadcasts more powerful, revelatory hallucinations of significant persons, places, and events, such as her ill-fated, adoptive mother, Anna Morgan's mental decline, and failed horse breeding business and equestrian competitions, as well as enigmatic symbols such as falling ladders, spinning chairs, and severed, wriggling fingers--beckoning her victims ever-closer to her abysmal black hole, like a ticking time bomb.

In the end, this potent, metaphysical cocktail of a film imbibes us with a morally perplexing, catch-22 twist: If faced with our own impending deaths, and that of our loved ones, including our children, and given only one chance to save everyone, would we take it? Rachel can do this by copying and proliferating Samara's wretched videotape. Doing so, however, condemns others to the same destiny. Altruistically, Rachel can sacrifice herself, Noah, and Aidan, ensuring the continuation of humanity. What if there are other videotapes in circulation unbeknownst to us?

As a child authority and high school teacher, author Koji Suzuki characterizes young people with intelligence, insight, and self-reliance---near equivalents of their adult counterparts, which we should welcome. Concomitantly, he warns us that our children are fragile and vulnerable beings, which should disarm us.",1155427200,3,6715,5.7417085427135675

1406145,4,B000059HCH,"The Ring started what became a wave of horror remakes from Japanese cinema, and while other tales such as The Grudge were not as critically well received, The Ring truly earned its merit among audiences.

The movie starts out with Seatle reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) aiding her sister after the mysterious death of her niece-- a death that was provoked by watching a mysterious videotape and not following the rules in order to save one's life.

After seeing the tape herself, Rachel is horrified to learn that those who see it have seven days until they die, unless they somehow manage to avoid death, by performing the task that the spirit haunting the tape wishes the viewer to do; if you're not familiar with the full plot by now, keep yourself unspoiled and discover it for yourself!

As the film progresses Rachel seeks the help an exboyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) in order to discover the origins of the mysterious tape before it is too late. What Rachel discovers is a dark, hidden story from one of the Pacific Northwest's many small island communities, where a small girl arrived with her adoptive parents, only to cause grief that they could have never imagined.

Has she young girl returned to seek her revenge?

The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset. Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest.

The writing, acting, and directing is all top-notch as far as I am concerned.  The atmosphere of the movie sets the stage for a story of dread and apprehension.  It takes an unbelievable premise and almost makes it seem plausible.  This is important to me for a horror movie to work.

Though I did think the movie was scary, I might also describe it as a thriller.  The ""surprise ending"", which I in fact predicted, added to the appeal of the film.  To me it is a better version of the Japanese movie ""Ringu"" from which it was adapted.  As far as contradictions in the plot, few movies have a perfect story line.  The critics need to realize that there are movies other than dramas that are well made.  This is one of the best.

The premise and basic storyline are brilliant.  The story that follows an investigation gives the writers a lot to work with.  Throughout the story as some questions are answered, new ones arise.  The atmosphere is intense and the fact that many things are shown only briefly (like Samara's face) or not at all add to the appeal of the movie.  Not all questions are answered, but again, maybe they shouldn't be....and that also sets up for a nice sequel too.  All in all, ""The Ring"" deserves to be on a list with classics like ""Rosemary's Baby, ""The Exorcist"", The Shining"", and ""Poltergiest"", (and maybe the ""Sixth Sense"") as classic horror movies that changes or added to the genre.",1145923200,,1537,4.510869565217392
1406150,4,B000059HCH,"The ironic thing about The Ring is that it is obviously a horror flick, yet I don't find it that scary. It's suspenseful. It's thrilling. But scary? Only in a couple of places. One place being the beginning with the 2 girls and towards the end when Samarra comes out of the tv.

The pacing is right, and the movie holds its audience hostage with an unshakeable dread the entire time.

As usual, Naomi Watts is excellent. This was her first real role after her Oscar nomination-worthy performance in Mulholland Drive. The role of Rachel was originally offered to Jennifer Connelly; and to be honest I would have loved to have seen what Jennifer would have done in a dark movie like this, considering she is my second favorite actress. Naomi is my favorite, but sometimes certain actors and actresses seem like they could fit better in certain roles than others; and Jennifer does well in films where she's being haunted in some way. But I digress...Naomi does a good job here, and that's all that matters in the end.

The Ring was a commercial and critical success and put Naomi Watts's career on the steady rise.

1406151,4,B000059HCH,"I remember generally liking ""The Ring"" when I saw it in theaters, but thinking that it was somewhat sketchy and choppy.  I liked it better on DVD, realizing that the film itself is meant to be almost as surreal, nightmarish, and dreamlike as the short videotape that troubles everyone during the course of the story.  To that end, everything isn't neatly explained, as the movie is mainly about imagery and mood than linear, coherent story telling.  I should add, though, that I agree with other reviewers here that if you watch and listen closely, you are given everything you need to get a satisfying sense of what's going on.

Also worth a look on the DVD is the short companion film by director Gore Verbinski that delves deeper into the events of ""The Ring"".  In actuality, the short film is essentially the movie's deleted scenes, intercut with shots from the scary videotape.  But it's all done quite skillfully, and it gives you more details about the main characters, as well as some surprising fates to characters we only saw for a scene or two in the movie's final cut (for example, there was originally a good bit more with the guy who rented out the cabin to the teenagers).  Also fun to see is a short trailer to the original Japanese horror film, ""Ringu"", of which ""The Ring"" is the American remake.

Let me conclude my throwing some kudos to Naomi Watts, who gives a subtle, nuanced performance in ""The Ring"", yet also knows when simple terror and blood-curdling screams are the things that are called for in certain scenes.  She's great to watch here.",1145232000,,1568,4.672727272727273
1406152,4,B000059HCH,"This film is hella creepy, it's one of the most disturbing movies I have seen.  It starts with a bang and though it does flag at times, overall it keeps up the suspense.

It has more meaning and is a whole lot scarier than the 2nd! Sure, it's not the easiest plot to follow, but at least it's full of suspense! The part that scares me the most is when Katie's mom is talking to Aiden's aunt about how she saw her daughter dead in the closet, and a flashback happens and you see Katie sitting dead in her closet with a wierd, deformed face. Another part that's strange is the pictures of whoever watched the video are always blurred. It's movies like these that are restoring my faith in horror culture.

 If you need any reasurence that movies can still be scary, watch The Ring. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film! And make sure you avoid the sequel.

The fact that this wasn't a slasher film but a psychological film didn't bother me but a lot of things didn't make sense like where did the video come from and why is it that this girl is evil and how does she have this power to kill people and why does she talk to the boy. On a good note the scenery is very beautiful, with all the fog and how it's dark and dismal which gives the movie a very creepy feeling that I liked.

But the aunt of the girl, Rachel, is a journalist. And after her sister begs her to research such occurences, Rachel is determined to find answers.

I don't want to give any more details of this film--you'll want to see it for yourself. When I first saw this movie, I knew absolutely nothing about it. And that is exactly how everyone should see it.

After watching this film, I truly was disturbed. The haunting music, the terrifying use of color in relation to the emotions in the film, and the mystery that ultimately leads to a shock so terrifying and so intiially confusing will keep you thinking about the film for weeks.

The movie is never as good as it was the first time you saw it. Nothing beats the sheer terror of the ending, and that cannot be replicated after viewing it. Nevertheless, you will watch it again-- and again, and again, and again. You'll want to pay more attention, find more details, learn more about the story. I certainly did.

There's only one problem: The sequel was an abysmal failure. There is not a shred of reason to see it. So please, don't.

Rachel must now hurry up and solve the mystery within the time period or she too will succumb to the videotapes murderous wrath.

A remake of the Japanese hit ""Ringu"", this is probably the best horror movie of the last 10 years. It's no where near as entertaining or as frightening as some of the earlier classics but when compared to the numerous horror movie atrocities released from Hollywood recently, fans of the genre should be thankful ""The Ring"" exists. It has good performances from the ensemble cast (although the child star David Dorfman is rather charmless), a sinister storyline (although a bit confusing) and some effective visuals. I really like the fact that the film does not try to explain every little detail and leaves a lot to the viewers imagination. For instance, the origins of the evil is not fully explained so the viewer is left with several unanswered questions at the film's conclusion. Also interesting is the film's overall look. There is a lot of grey skies and rain on display. The entire mood is dark, grey and depressingly gloomy adding to the overall tension and fear. The actors themselves have a constant blank stare on their scared faces adding to the tone.

Let's not forget one of the key figures in ""The Ring"", the heinous, murderous Samara. A one-of-a-kind, under-sized villain with a heart of stone and a mind full of vengeance. In ""Ringu"" the villain's face is never shown (only her eyes) and she does not speak. She remains a mysterious, silent, face-less character throughout the film. Not so in ""The Ring"". We not only get to clearly see the child monster but we get to hear her as well. There is a face to the plot's evil and despite this, it does not seem to diminish Samara's eerie hold over the audience.

My biggest complaint with this film is that it's far too long. The whole mystery could have been solved a good 25 minutes sooner so the film does drag a bit. But considering ""The Ring"" is the best fright film Hollywood has given us in a very, very long time, it's a small price to pay.

This disturbing little chiller is highly recommended. You might want to double your pleasure and follow it up with it's much inferior but still watchable sequel ""The Ring Two"".",1138752000,2,2481,4.696551724137931

1406183,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring is an excellent, creepy horror movie. Along with 'The Others', its the scariest movie I've seen in decades. It actually has a good plot, with a Hitchcockian mystery and family secrets layered on top of terror. Sad and touching at times, always unsettling, this is a haunting movie with almost unbearable tension. Despite some of the complaints about plot points, I thought most loose ends were tied up, the major one that was unresolved was the issue of Samara's origin. The DVD has few additional features, but a nice set of deleted clips, including a great alternate ending.

Let me also answer some of the questions the previous reviewer raised:

""Who made the tape and why?"" Samara made it with her mental powers when Katie and others were trying to tape a football game in the cabin (this is pretty clear from Katie's statements at the  begining).  Her ability to burn images into film is also mentioned in the interview sequence.

""How does the tape do what it does and why?"" The tape is itself just a vessel for Samara's psychic abilities. As to why, Samara kills people, you can read it as either her ""wanting to be heard"" as mentioned in the movie, or because she's evil and cruel or because she wants other people to suffer as she herself did in the well for 7 days.

""Why does the grandfather kill himself?""  What grandfather ? Mr Morgan is Samara's father (adopted ), not grandfather, (you would really not have to be paying attention to think he's the grandfather).  He kills himself because he realizes that Samara is still not gone despite being dead.

""If Our Heroine knows it's dangerous, why does she make a copy at all"". 2 reasons -- she doesn't realize the copy (rather than the original) is dangerous and she wants to analyze the tape. And at that point, she's still slightly skeptical about the tape.

""Why doesn't anyone ever stop the tape or destroy it, or turn off the TV or VCR?"" Most people seen watching the tape don't realize its dangerous, otherwise they wouldn't see in the first place. Destroying the tape doesn't stop the curse after you've watched it.

""Why is it that only certain people die?"" its fairly clear at the end -- the only way to escape the curse is to make a copy and give it to someone else to see. Rachael makes a copy and Aidan sees it, so she doesn't die.

I don't think you need to watch the movie twice or see The Ring 2 to get almost all of these points.",1136505600,3,2417,4.493150684931507

Why does the grandfather kill himself? If Our Heroine knows it's dangerous, why does she make a copy at all? Why doesn't anyone ever stop the tape or destroy it, or turn off the TV or VCR? Why is it that only certain people die? At the end, it felt unfinished - as if the director had wanted to keep so many visuals in it that he ran out of time to actually tell the complete story. (And no offense to previous reviewers, but you shouldn't have to watch a movie repeatedly to deduce that.) I felt like my time had been wasted, being dragged through an unfinished story.

1406186,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring (unlike its inferior sequel) is a complex, mysterious movie with a deep backstory. However, it is told in a subtle almost evasive way in which the audience needs to figure it out through repeated viewings. The Ring's fascinating yet mysterious story spawned many websites and web forums simply devoted to unraveling its mysteries. If you were ever confused about what in the world this movie was about here are the basic meanings behind the story. Though the movie is meant to be ""interpretive"" and many create their own explanations to many of the mysteries, here are the ones generally agreed upon by The Ring aficionados. Much of this information is taken from Ring websites and forums. WARNING: Watch the movie first since this will basically give all the major story behind the plot away. You've been warned.

The Backstory of Samara and the Morgan's:
Samara, when alive, was a very powerful psychic child with a terrible sadistic streak. She could implant her nightmarish mental images into photograph film. This specific ability is labelled by Eola County Psychiatric Hospital as ""projected thermography"". This is what is generaly known as PHOTOKINESIS (the telekinetic ability to create, control, and manipulate light and energy). She also had limited Telepathic powers as she had the ability of implanting thoughts and images into the minds of others (into her parent's minds and the horses at the Morgan ranch), however, she could not tell the future nor read other's minds since she could not stop her own murder. She may have had Hydrokinesis (the ability to manipulate water) and she also seems to have Pyrokinesis (the ability to manipulate fire) -- the wooden walls in her barn room were burned by her. Anna Morgan could not have a child naturally and according to her husband Richard, ""was not supposed to"". The Morgan's left the island and came back with a very young Samara, ""adopted, they said"". Afterwards Samara began attacking Anna Morgan (along with the horses and apparently Richard Morgan) with horrific images and hallucinations. Anna was driven almost insane and would spend hours brushing her hair in front of a mirror for no reason. Anna spent some time in a mental ward. Samara was diagnosed by doctors and paranormal researchers. Richard Morgan apparently put a stop to that and tries to hinder any more attention on the ""little monster"" Samara (apparently out of concern for society). Anna, out of sheer torment and maybe also out of concern for society, kills Samara by throwing her down the well. (Its interesting to note that Richard may have also been there helping since its unlikely Anna had the strength to move the stone lid over the well by herself). After spending seven days slowly dying at the bottom of the well Samara contemplates revenge on all humanity over her horrific death. Anna Morgan commits suicide by jumping off a cliff apparently out of a combination of guilt and persisting hallucinations (probably intensified by Samara's agony and rage directed at Anna while dying in the well).

The documents:
There are shown several documents regarding the whole backstory from which some of the above is based on. There are two interesting ones of note. A certificate of live birth of Samara is shown stating the Morgan's as parents. Another interesting document states that Samara was impervious to physical pain. Neither of these two documents seems to be of any relevance in either of the two Ring movies.

Samara, the present:
Samara, now dead, exists mainly in these 3 primary ways:
1) Her psychic energy persists inside the minds of her victims who watched the tape (in dreams and hallucinations).
2) Part of her psychic energy seems to persists in the physical world mainly in broadcast signals (air waves, phone lines) and magnetic media like VHS tape, (example: the phone rings when you make the connection to her after watching the tape). When alive one could assume that Samara learned or accomplished this while spending months isolated in a barn with only a television as her companion.
3) Around the immediate vicinity of death. Her spirit haunts that place down in the well.

The Tape
The images on the tape are a combination of dream imagery and symbols that representing some aspects of Samara's life, her suffering and death, and the ""nightmare images"" she likes to come up with. Most prominent was the ring of light created by the well's stone lid that she would stare at for seven days until she died -- hence The Ring.

The Curse:
Samara, now dead, has no power over the world or the living, except down in the well which she haunts. The ONLY way Samara could spread her curse and kill her victims was through the visuals of her VHS tape. The images act as a conduit for her psychic force to infect the minds of the ones who watch the images. If Samara is in your head, she can kill you! (Apparently in the most horrific way causing cardiac arrest and facial deformity.) The VHS tape concerned in the movie had its origin in the lodge that was built above her well where the teens where taping a football game but  the ""curse"" images were taped instead. Samara's angry spirit did it. The victims, with Samara firmly in their brains overseeing them now, were spared death if they made a copy and made someone else watch it, but that is merely a riddle that few can solve in time. Thus, a perpetuator of the curse is spared death but most will die.

The death of  Richard Morgan:
Richard Morgan was still being plagued by the hallucinations for years until his death (he states this in the bathtub scene) and somehow knew that now (via the tapes) Samara's curse was out in the world so he kills himself. Richard thought the tape-duping was only the beginning in which Samara would be unleashed on the world.

Conclusion:
There you have it. Take this with you next time you watch the movie, ;). This also does not contradict the inferior sequel's continuity of the story either, even though the sequel seems to diminish the importance of the tape curse (unfortunately). The disappointing sequel is a lot less about backstory, unsolved mysteries and family ambiguities and more about the immediate scenario of Aiden's possession by Samara's spirit and it also tries to add conclusion in the form of a hockey hollywoodesque showdown between Rachel and Samara. The only backstory information we get from the sequel is that Samara's real mother is still alive but insane and Samara's spirit has tried many times throughout the years to posses other children, that's really it.",1133222400,47,6547,4.854073410922113
1406187,3,B000059HCH,"I did have a nice evening alone. Except for I watched The Ring. Gee... that was horrific. Not a movie one should watch alone... especially with such a nice, active imagination like mine. Disturbing movie... and I like scary movies. But, the scary movies I like are purely psychological; I don't really like them so much if they rely on morbid images and quick camera flashes, so I didn't really like it so much, even though it was psychological, lol. They relied a little to much on the camera and actor's fashial expressions... though the build up and overall atmosphere was perfect.

I think that one of the problems might be that the only humane element in the entire movie was wripped apart by the final sequence. In other thriller/horror movies I've seen there was always a certain human element to fall back on--in Secret Window there is always Mort's frustration with life, and struggle to survive; in The Forgotten there is a mother trying to save her child--in The Ring there is none of this. The children are all morbid, the two protagonists are frustratingly detatched from each other, and when finally brought together, one of them is killed off.

Now that my rant is over, let me go ahead and say that the movie was extremely well done, and accomplishes what the fillmmakers were going for in frighteningly precise fashion. The actual video tape is haunting (just as much after the movie is over as during), and is so resemblant of the most horrifying nightmare you've ever had.

The movie does lack on certain points--the fact taht only about half of the images in the video recurr later in the film, the fact that a body in a well over thirty years simply wouldn't be ""floating around"" on the top. Aiden isn't natural at all (though I'm sure this is intended). He was actually more disturbing to me than Samara--why wouldn't Rachel have noticed this?

All in all, this is a thriller that goes the distance, despite not being as psychological as I may have preferred. Actually, my main problem is I really did get the heck scared out of me!

I think it can be so scary because the entire structure of the movie takes you anywhere and everywhere. Obviously, the screenwriter and director decided to take you anywhere that could be terrifying -- a dark and dusty old barn, a cabin ruled by demonic forces, a bizarre old insane asylum, a hidden sealed up well.

It has lots of terrifying images -- photos that come alive, submerged corpses, deadly falls from high places, malevolent beings you can't figure out that are out to kill you or maybe just take over your mind.  The scary image set apart at a safe distance joins you in your safe little room.

The movie's imagery is chilling without being juvenile. It can be enjoyed on many levels--yes, it's a horror film, but it's also making some profound statements about the ""viral"" nature of stories that race through our mass media, poisoning our society. One husband kills his wife and pregnant child--this is horrific, but the way it is reported on makes one feel as if our entire society is depraved and falling to pieces. Does it push others over the edge? Push others to perform the same act? We are monkey-like in our need to mimic the latest trendy fashions, repeat the same sorts of ""acceptable"" opinions in the same sorts of groups. Many of us don't stop to realize how much we are infected by the virus-like influence of the media--and how often we then pass it on via our choices, opinions, actions.

1406205,5,B000059HCH,"Four teenagers watch a strange videotape on a weekend jaunt, and a week later they are all dead.  A suicide, a car accident, and a hideous, inexplicable heart attack.  One mother, distraught at the death of her daughter begs her sister Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a reporter, to investigate the mystery.  Rachel first stumbles over the tape, then her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) sees it when she goes to him for help, and finally her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) watches the tape.  Now they are in the midst of a race to discover the story behind the tape and avert their deaths.  A simple plot, built out of what is almost an urban legend.  But not a simple film by any means.

This version of the story is based on the Japanese film Ringu, which in turn is based on Koji Suzuki's book.  In each form, the story depends not on scenes of great horror, but on a careful creation of atmosphere that gradually turns up the tension.  Visual horror is used only occasionally, but each director has carefully used the symbols introduced in the videotape throughout the story, until real and unreal completely overlap and the viewer sees portents everywhere.

Director Gore Vorbinski is a bit more heavy handed about this, but he does it so well, and the cinematography is to visually gripping that I actually prefer his approach to the Japanese version, which requires more watching to break through the layers of subtlety, as well as some awareness of the matrix of Japanese legends that the story keys off of.  Instead Vorbinski updates the underlying story behind the curse and incredible use of a horse farm to give the story a more understandable context for the US viewer.

The acting is understated, almost minimalist, making the characters almost part of the ambience of the film, rather than acting in the center of a stage.  Emotion is there when it is called for, though, but one of the most stellar bits of acting is done by Dorfman as Aidan Keller, who manages to the most unnerving character of the plot.  Having seen both the Japanese and US films, I can honestly say that both are worth seeing.  One learns as much from the differences as you do from the similarities.",1125705600,4,2189,4.678851174934726
1406206,4,B000059HCH,"Naomi Watts stars in this scary and thrilling film about a videotape that kills the viewer after seven days.  During the final week, the victims suffer from terrifying hallucinations and nose bleeds.

At the beginning, two friends, Katie and Rebecca, are watching TV when Katie reveals that she has seen the mysterious video.  True to its nature, Katie ends up dying at the hands of the video, while Rebecca, being so traumitized from witnessing Katie's death, is committed to a mental institution.  Katie's death brings in her cousin Aidan and his mom Rachel (Watts), a reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer.  Katie's mother requests that Rachel investigate the story behind the video.  The task becomes harder when Rachel watches the video herself and then realizes she may die within a week.

A race against time soon develops, as Rachel, Aidan, and Rachel's estranged boyfriend Noah seek to unlock the mystery of the tape.

As Rachel conducts her research, more and more questions arise.  A woman who appears in the video turns out to be Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who goes insane after adopting a young girl named Samara.  Also, the images on the tape continue to turn up during the investigation.  What will become of Rachel's investigation?  What is Samara's connection to the story?  Will Rachel die after seven days like Katie did?

This movie goes beyond the traditional slasher film, instead relying on psychological ""whodunnit"" type terror to attract the viewer.  The ending is by far the highlight of the film.  If you're a fan of psychological terror over blood and guts, then ""The Ring"" is a perfect movie for you.",1125360000,,1837,4.947712418300654

This girl named Samara got thrown in a well by her mom for her father did not love her. Her nightmares are on this tape and if you watch it the phone will ring and it'll say: seven days. Freaky!,1124755200,2,295,3.8524590163934427
1406229,4,B000059HCH,"A true connoisseur of the scary movie (note, not slasher flicks but psychological thrillers) will recognize certain spooky elements in many of the ""classics"" of the genre: the cruel parent (or stepparent); the otherworldly child, a medium for the spirit world; and, the violent reaction of animals, children and the insane to the presence of evil. Certain images are also commonly found in these movies and are preternaturally disturbing: wells, bleak cliffs, lighthouses, remote cabins in the woods, lone autumnal trees on hillsides, rainy nights, and other symbols of isolation.

Renowned mythologist, Joseph Campbell, argued that certain tales and images are part of our universal consciousness and, therefore, part of collective human storytelling. Heavily influenced by Carl Jung, Campbell described how these themes reoccur throughout the tapestry of stories told by groups divided by time and geography. Perhaps then there should be no surprise that certain images reappear with such alarming effectiveness in scary movies whether the source is Hollywood, or in this case, Japan.

Based on ""Ringu"", a series of books by Kji Suzuki (the ""Stephen King of Japan""), Hideo Nakata directed the original, record-breaking box office smash for Asian audiences (1998), which DreamWorks decided would translate well for American audiences. Gore Verbinski was chosen to direct even though he is best known for more light-hearted fare such as ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Mexican.""

The premise is fairly simple. Urban legend meets scary movie reality when four teens die, as predicted, exactly seven days to the minute from when they watched an unmarked video in a remote mountain cabin. The aunt of one of the teenagers is a savvy and skeptical journalist whose curiosity is sparked by tales of the tape. After finding and watching the source of the mystery, she receives a phone call announcing that she has seven days. From there, it is a race to solve the clues and answer the riddle of the video, with the stakes greatly raised when two of the people closest to her, including her young son, watch the deadly tape.

The video itself is a mosaic of images both familiar and disturbing. With its mirrors, wriggly things, ladders, and-of course -- rings, you might think you were watching ""Un Chien Andalou"" (Luis Buuel and Salvador Dali's 1929 surrealist classic) as directed by David Lynch after he had been reading Jung and not getting enough fresh air.

As one born to the genre, Director Verbinski does an excellent job of letting our imaginations find portent and peril in the most mundane of actions, such as picking up groceries at the local corner store. Naomi Watts, a relatively unknown actress for those who missed her in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001), plays Rachel, the journalist whose desire to find the cause of her niece's death becomes a life or death quest for answers. For all of us who have rolled our eyes at the screaming teen, walking backward alone through the dark house, Watts will be a relief as she plays through the gamut of Rachel's emotions with truly credible, but not overwrought, gusto. While the adults are busy solving the riddle of the tape, the heart-stopping dyad of the Ring's children usher in the deeper dimension of fear. Rachel's son, Aiden (a stony-eyed David Dorfman) is the medium and interpreter for the terrifying Samara (Daveigh Chase), who lays at the heart of the mystery.

""The Ring"" dips deep in the well of those aforementioned familiar scary images, which paradoxically results in a movie that is both architecturally firm but-with little new to add-empty of true revelation. Joseph Campbell could have used this movie as a reference book for universally terrifying images, but perhaps the tale itself was more effectively told in Japanese.

Parents should know that this movie is very, very scary. Four people and a horse die on-screen, with the potential for many more untimely demises throughout and-don't read on if you enjoy surprises-beyond the end of the movie. The overall tone is creepy and would leave many of the staunchest of movie-goers in dire need of brightly lit rooms and laughter.

Families who see this movie should talk about the decision that Rachel makes at the end of the movie and the ramifications of her actions. They might also wish to discuss the way that different characters deal with the untimely death of a loved one.

Families who enjoy this movie might wish to shiver together over ""The Shining"", ""The Omen"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". Alternately, they might wish to never watch a video again (especially an unmarked one) and opt to have a Scrabble night instead, preferably after turning on all the lights in the house.",1124668800,,4737,5.0550576184379

And the legend happens that if you watch a video tape, you will get a phone call from a stranger, that tells you that you will die in 7 days, now how do they know if you watch the tape? When the movies opens, Katie (Amber Tamblyn), is at a cottage, with her best friend Becca (Rachael Bella), and they can't find something good to watch on TV, Becca tells her the legend of  a tape, and Katie infroms her best freind that she has already seen the tape, exactly 7 days before. Within seconds, the phone rings, and it is Katie's Mom, but before the night is over, Katie is dead, and Becca is scared by her own best freind's death. And now we meet her aunt reporter Rachel (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman), and she starts to work on the case of her niece's strange and sudden death. And she question's her niece best friends, a learns of the tape. Which leave her to the cottage that her niece was staying at the cottage that the time of her death. She chesk in at the office, and gets the same cottage, to take a nap in, before she returns home, and finds the tape in the office, takes it to the cottage, and watches the tape, and sees a girl on the tape (Daveigh Chase), and then  she gets the call, informing her ""7 days"". So now what she will do her final 7 days, she inlists the help of her ex-husband (Martin Henderson), on the case of  the tape.

1406231,5,B000059HCH,"Back in the 1980's, when I was in Elementary School, I saw my very first horror movie, Nightmare on Elm Street part 4. After that, I didn't see another horror movie until Middle School in the early 90's, I saw Friday The 13th part 7. After seeing Friday the 13th, I started really liking horror movies and started watching everything from Stephen King, every Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, a lot more that aren't so popular and of course the Halloween movies. I was able to watch horror movies for years and years without being affected really. It was to the point that some horror movies were just putting me to sleep because they weren't scary. That is, until I saw The Ring and The Ring Two!

I saw The Ring in the theatre and from that first time, it scared me to death. I literally jumped during many scenes and after it was over, it wasn't really over for me. That night after I got back home, I couldn't sleep with the light off. I didn't want to see any static on my TV because I was so scared. My friend who I saw it with kept mentioning a static TV just to scare me and it worked. I have also had a few nightmares about Samara coming after me since I saw The Ring and especially, The Ring Two. The scariest thing that has happened to me was right after I saw The Ring Two in the theatre and that evening after I fell asleep, I swear I heard Samara speaking to me!! I swear it!!! It was her same voice that you hear in The Ring and it was like she was talking right in my ear!! The only thing I actually heard her say was the very first thing and very last thing she said. I heard her talking for a while but everything in the middle, I just didn't understand because it was like I was half awake and half asleep. All I was able to hear her say was ""I never sleep because I'm not dead yet"" and the very last thing she said was ""wake up."" After this happened, I decided to get rid of The Ring DVD, Rings DVD and not even buy The Ring Two because apparently, these films are going to just scare me to where I'll be terrified for the rest of my life!!

You know that saying, be careful what you wish for because you might just get it? Well I got a lot more than I wished for all right!!! For years before The Ring came out, I was wishing for a horror movie that would really scare me and this movie scaring me is an understatement!! I never wanted to be scared so bad by having nightmares!! Just the other day, I was watching The Travel Channel and there was this show on about different haunted places and this one mansion was built by an Opera singer who used to perform in her house to people and I thought it was interesting and it didn't scare me in the least UNTIL they had to show the Opera singer's ghost and the ghost looked EXACTLY like Samara, had her long black hair over her face like Samara and she started walking toward the camera which meant, towards me as well. For a second I was freaking out thinking she was going to come out of the TV!!! Before she got too close, I covered my eyes and then they showed another part in the mansion and I just changed the channel!! I think the part that freaks me out the most is when Samara is out of the well and coming toward the TV and in The Ring Two when you see her climbing the well, that creepy way she climbs the well!! For some reason, I cannot get those visions out of my head!!! So to say this movie is still affecting me to this day is a HUGE understatement!!! The thing I just cannot understand is WHY any other horror movie just either puts me to sleep or just wonderful to watch because of the acting or just cool to watch?? I'll NEVER understand what it is about Samara and The Ring and The Ring Two that just terrifies me!! Maybe it's the static TV and the fear of Samara actually coming out of the TV!",1124496000,2,3795,4.099462365591398

It's the American version of the Japanese ""Ringu"" made in 1998.

It starts out as two teenage girls talking about a video tape that will kill a person in seven days. They're joking about it, until one girl mentions that she had actually watched it.

And she died.

The deceased girl's aunt Rachel, a reporter for a newspaper, gets wind of the story about the tape at her neice's funeral. She finds out where to find the tape and brings it home with her to watch it.

Unfortunately, her little boy ends up watching the tape as well, so after recruiting her boy's father, they set off to break the curse.

It's not the story that's scary, it's how the history of the tape is played out in the movie. This movie isn't graphic or gory, it's psycologically frightening.

I've seen a LOT of scary movies, but this one definitely rates as one of the top five!

It's a MUST SEE!",1120262400,,970,4.35

I have seen other horror flicks that are rated R and are really not that bad. It's so scary with very little gore and the music is scary too. The perfect combination for a good movie.

This movie is based on the Japanese movie The Ringu which came out in 1998 in Japan. It's about a cursed video tape that after you watch it you get a phone call with a chilling voice saying "" 7 days"". Naomi Watts plays a Seattle based reporter named Rachael. She has to solve the mystery of the tape after an unexplained death occurs. She is skeptical at first about a tape floating around that kills people.  But after hearing more about the tape and learning of other coinciding mysterious deaths; she finally decides to investigate and watch the tape. While watching the tape she slowly starts to learn that its not a hoax . She also receives chilling phone call after viewing it. Rachael now has 7 days to solve the mystery or she is dead too. The video tape itself is eerie as hell with some very disturbing images. The images give clues that we see during the whole movie which Rachael and Noah research and try to painstakingly figure out.

Whoever made the tape draws Rachael more into the tape to the point where she starts to hallucinate, physcially feel things related to the tape, scribling something on a piece of paper making a horse go crazy, and nose bleeds. The tape is somehow using Rachael to let her know how this person felt physcially. Racheal is also mentally drawn into the tape in 2 scenes. Noah is also drawn into the tape after he watches it and only experiences nose bleeds.  Aiden finally watches the tape too and experiences nose bleeds and hallucinations from which something mysteriously ends up on both his wrists. After seeing this Rachael does everything she can to save her son.

The Seatle setting is very rainy and chilly so it makes it even scary and the Racheal's son Aiden ( David Dorfman) is a little freeky to and seems to know what's going on, what will happen, or what has happened. He talks about someone he seems to know but how he knows this person is really interresting. He reminds me of the little kid Danny from The Shining. Does he have some special connection to the tape which remains to be asked. The movie is pretty interesting though and keeps you guessing till the very end. The music throughout the whole movie is well composed and it does wonders to some of the scenes throughout. Even then it's hard to figure out unless you watch it again. Place close attention to the film because many scenes relate back to the tape and it will help you understand it better. This is also very pyschological too. Its just to great to describe. I would not considered it your typical horror movie because the elements are different than the regular slasher flicks we see these days. I highly recommend it!!!! You will be so scared!! There is also an extra edition on this DVD which have more scary scenes that were edited from the original and give more clues. A definate added bonus!!",1119398400,,3190,4.455479452054795

Many others summarize the story, so I will instead share my thoughts on it.  The movie starts off by almost teasing us into believing it will be a teeny-bopper type movie by starting off in the bedroom of two teenage girls talking about boys and movies.

But it quickly moves on to an intelligent and well thought-out storyline that entertains us and moves along at a good pace.  While it is not predictable it is logical.  I was left waiting for the next scene and anxiously awaiting the next scene.

The movie finishes itself off with an ending that surprised some moviegoers.  Yes, ""the little girl (can't spell her name) is evil"".  Near the end when Rachel falls in the well, it seems she has resued the little girl's spirit from 25 years of torment following her murder.  But if the movie had ended like that, the question would have been, ""why did her mother kill her?""  There were many other hints in the movie that Samara was actually an evil entity and it would have been dissapointing if it had ended any other way.

Some will not like the movie since it is not based on cheap special effects and a murder a second.  Instead the Ring relies on solid writing and strong dialog to make it one of the best horror movies ever.",1118448000,,1382,4.506024096385542

Whose phone did she use to call the victims from after they watched the tape? Do dead people own cell phones? Hi this is Samra, I'm dead and you will be too in seven days, Can you hear me now????

Cast:  Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn.

Running Time:  115 minutes.

Rated PG-13 for intense situations, violence, and some language.

Adapted from the 1998 Japanese classic ""Ringu"", screenwriter Ehren Kruger continues his success after films such as ""Arlington Road"" and the ""Scream"" series with this incredibly edgy, taught thriller.  Director Gore Verbinksi (no pun intended) is a hidden gem with this film before his supreme success with ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series.  Naomi Watts stars in a breakthrough role as a single parent/news reporter who learns of the mysterious death of a family member.  Personally charged to get answers concerning the grisly aftermath and occupationally energized to bring her findings onto the television screen, Rachel Keller (Watts) dives deeper and deeper into secrets of a video tape that is causing all of this horror.  When her investigation brings her small son (the creepy youngster Dorfman) and her ex-lover (Henderson) into the mix, Rachel must solve the mystery and save her loved ones before it's too late.

An excellent, intelligent screenplay by Kruger is projected onto the big screen in a deliciously scary manner.  The film is not overly violent (although you would believe otherwise due to the director's name), but uses atmosphere and tension to create its scares, rather than campy blood and guts.  Watts is very strong in the starring role, showing some cinematic range and displaying a set of lungs that may end up rivaling none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.  While the twentieth century has brought on a barrage of disrespected, simple-minded, and ridiculous horror films, ""The Ring"" shines above the rest as a solid adventure into a new scope of the genre and succeeds mightily due to its superb direction and cinematography.  Lots of jolts and jumps, as well as one hell of a creepy videotape.  One of the best horror films of the decade thus far.

Once it was; I rented it(luckily) and wanted to see what the whole hype was about.

First of all, let me start off stating that this is not a bad movie. It actually gives an interesting plot which makes it eager to know what happens next. The direction is not that bad, the story is awesome but unfortunatley it couldn't be kept as good for the film.

I'm not a huge horror movie fan, but I do tend to watch the most I can. Prolly one of the reasons why this movie was pretty much a disapointment for me it's because of it's lack of taste of horror. This could easily be more of a thriller than anything else, because since that's not the case this movie should of been a 'Bomb' instead. There are one or two scenes that might make you gasp but nothing to be excited for it.

1406296,5,B000059HCH,"I had heard of the ring from everyone around me when it had first come out, but not much after that. I heard about it later on when it came out on DVD, and since it was PG-13, I figured I could get it (I was only 13, and parents have limits on what they let their kids watch). I must admit, it didn't really scare me that much with the purpose it was supposed to. It did have jumps and twists that were indeed frightening, but what I really like the film is the originality of it, and the perfectness. I'll explain later.

Rachel Keller (the gorgeous Naomi Watts) is pretty much set into two words. Young and independent. Her son Aidan will show to that. But when her 16 year old neice dies, her thoughts begin to change about several things, especially life. Normally you'd shake off a teens death with the possibility of drugs, but what about three other kids Katie knew that all died at the exact same time as her?

Rumors arouse about a video tape the four teenagers may have watched. Rachel, an investigative reporter, tracks down the tape, and inspects it, only to find that by doing so, she's just unravelled her own sealed fate. Now, the race against time is on to figure out who has created this mysterious and evil video tape, and why it is murdering people before Rachel herself falls victim to the ring.

Gore Verbinski, who was the director, did an awesome job with the directing. The all too famous quote on the front cover tells it all. The acting in the movie is so good, it's scary. Naomi Watts as the young Rachel with her child did a good job at portraying a woman who has obviously gone through a lot in the past. David Dorfman as the independent Aidan did amazing also. I don't know how old that kid is, but however old he is, he's a really good child actor.

There's a strange way that the ring captures audiences, which is why it was such a box office hit. There's just something that can't be explained, sort of like The Blair Witch Project was. Maybe it was it's jumps and it's twists and turns that have you going against everyone, yet in the end, you only have one villian, and that is one bad seed. Samara's origin is never explained, but that doesn't really matter to audiences who keep coming back for more.

The affects and suspense in the movie do indeed add up to a lot of satisfying events, even some funny moments, but as tedious as the title may seem, it is relevant to the story. Some of the things in here (say the affects) are so perfect, that it makes you wonder how dreamworks pulled it off. It's a pretty thought provoking movie which will leave you wondering what happened, but sometimes, things don't need to make sense for a movie to be a good one. Seriously, I can't wait for the Ring Two to come out in March. Until then, looks like Samara will still never sleep.",1113091200,2,2810,4.334600760456274

1406298,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring is an engrossing horror movie that will have you at the edge of your seats from beginning to end.

Storyline- The storyline of the Ring is basically a deadly tape where if you watch it you get a call saying you will die in seven days. One lady named Susan (played by Naomi Watts) decides that she will watch it (although i'm not sure why) and now she has seven days to find a way to stop the effect of the tape and destroy it along with her husband Noah (played by Martin Henderson) and young son Aidan.

I thought the storyline of The Ring was a little bit simplistic. I think they could have made it quite a bit more complicated as the director Gore Verbinski could have done a better job, but however it was very entertaining and well done.

One other thing about The Ring that i didn't like that much is that random things kept happening. I know they must have had something to do with the story, but i did not like these random appearences by something like a centipedede. (as in the bug) Or for example she sees a centipede and her nose starts bleeding. Alrighty then!

But for the most part the storyline was hardly an issue and no reason why i shouldn't give this movie 5/5.

Acting/script- When you usually hear about these kinds of horror movies, you do not really expect the acting/script to be that great, just the special effects/how much it scares you. However i thought that The Ring was very well done in terms of acting/script. You can really tell in this movie what the character is feeling whether it is joy/horror/excitement. They show much emotion by the way they are acting and the way that they are talking. They even did a good job with Aidan and the way that he acted and talked. They way that the haunted girl moved and spoke was very creepy as well.

Special effects- Ahhh, definetetly one of the best parts of the movie has to be the special effects. Gore Verbinski definetely knew what he wanted in terms of effects in this movie. I think the top two parts in the movie that were best in terms of special effects has to be when they open the closet out of nowhere and there is that scary/demented/rotten face just sitting there with that freaky glare. Also, when the girl starts coming out of the tv, that is very scary/well done as well.

The actual video tape in The Ring is very scary, how it is acted. Random things keep happening (im talking about the actual videotape that they watch) which make it very scary. I was expecting something very cheesy, but boy, was i wrong.

In conclusion, Gore Verbinski and all of the actors sure succeeded in putting together and masterpiece and one of a kind horror movie. There is hardly any action scenes in this movie, but i find that the horror movies with no action are the better ones in the most part.",1112400000,,2787,4.387596899224806

1406312,2,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is yet another in a long line of movies that just can't live up to it's own hype. Hearing stories about people freaking out in theaters and odd things happening at home during viewings made me think I was in for one hell of a thrill. Despite the fact that I had my own eerie experience while watching this -- my phone started ringing at exactly the same time as the phone in the opening scene -- I still couldn't feel any intensity, any chills, or any entertainment. I don't ask much of my horror movies, not much at all, they don't have to be scary or full of gore (afterall, this is the guy who LIKED ""Open Water""), just as long as I can make some sort of connection and they entertain me for the 90+ minutes they run in. ""The Ring"" doesn't do that. Instead, we are subjected to a very good looking, but pretentious picture as done by ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" (another movie that had way too much hype) director, Gore Virbinski. Virbinski is no doubt a skilled director, but there is just too much eye candy here, as opposed to actual plot. Not for one minute did I really feel any characters were in danger, and the pace just kept going up and down so much that it just got annoying. Each time I would start to engage myself in the happenings, the movie would just let go of me. The overall story leaves much to be desired, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. I honestly don't understand how this movie could become such a phenomenom. Maybe it's just me. I know I need something a little more visceral to scare me or at least entertain me. ""The Ring"" is just a whole lotta nothing. There is one scene where a horse commits suicide that might arouse the sleepy haze that will most likely come over you, but it really has no other purpose to the story, and much like everything else in the movie, it was put there just to make you uncomfortable (it made me giggle uncontrollably). Towards the end of the movie, my dog barfed up a considerably large amount of food on my bed. Now that, my friends, is scary.",1111276800,3,2026,4.306282722513089
1406313,1,B000059HCH,"The problem today with movies especially horror movies is that everyone is desperate for money. All of these untalented writers and directors are just remaking films. Where are the original ideas!!! I mean seriously remaking Japanese horror movies... is Hollywood that desperate? Then again we almost remade every movie in the past 10 years, so we have to look at foreign films. Pathetic, which leads me to this awful movie ""The Ring"". First off the idea of watching a tape is extremeley cheezy. Not a good plot right off the bat....The ring was such a rip off of other horror movies such as the sixth sense. For example, there is always that child who knows too much and is ridiculously smart. In the ring Naomi Watts's son acts like hes a business man even though hes like 9 years old. He hears voices and can speak to the dead for some reason abd Forget about the ending it was so predictable. I won't give it away I'll let you horror fans witness this terrible ending. I don't think the horror fans today appreciate early horror movies such as the original texas chainsaw massacre, the last house on the left, motel hell...i mean those movies actually kept you on the edge of your seat. They actually captured suspense, unlike these pg-13 teen flicks. that also leads me to another dispute, all horror movies are rated pg-13 for some reason, gee i wonder why...MONEY! I remember once upon a time when screen writers only cared about portraying their idea on the big screen. The scripts nowadays are just shot out in less than  30 days, slap a pg-13 rating, add some scary music. Wrong!

If you re-watch the movie, you'll notice that they actually included some funny scenes and jokes in there to keep everybody happy. You may not 'get' the movie but that's why they made a sequel.

1406315,1,B000059HCH,"This film is a waste of time.

That said, the first ten minutes are extraordinary.  Nicely shot, creepy, beautifully paced, and well acted.  The only other ray of hope for this film was the first time we see one of Samara's victims (the blonde in the closet!  Holy crap!  I sure didn't see THAT coming in the theater!), but other than that this film tries and fails to repeat the aura of the first ten minutes for an couple of hours.  Most of it is just too ridiculous.  The horse scene, the electrocution scene, the final TV scene - nothing works.  It's just not good.  The horse/ferry scene is uneccessary, really just a lame attempt to be disturbing.  The electrocution scene is too drawn out and implausible (this is a movie about ghosts coming out of TVs - for a shot to not work in it because it's too fantastic is really something!).

This film almost works, or would have, if it ended after our heroine solved the mystery of the tape.  ""Wow,"" I said to myself in the theater as Naomi Watts and her beau walked off into the night, ""They really tried some interesting stuff in that movie.  Not all of it worked, but at least they tried.""  Then the film kept going.  ""Wait,"" I asked myself, ""Why aren't they rolling credits?""  Then it dawned on me that the movie was about to nosedive.  I distinctly remember saying ""No good can come of this."" aloud, referring to the decision to not end the film.  Obviously, I was horrendously disappointed.  After seeing Creepy Little Hospitalized Girl Samara, Soggy Vicious Undead Samara was silly.  The whole set-piece where Noah dies is totally predictable (right down to him tripping over something), Samara isn't scary, and removing frames of film to make movement jerky isn't frightening - it's headache inducing.  God-awful ending to a god-awful movie.

After paying for and sitting through all of Open Water in a local theater, my father said this to me: ""That movie was a bad joke.  I'm still waiting for the punchline.""  I leaned over and said ""Eight dollars!""

That works for The Ring, too.",1110931200,3,2042,4.621169916434541
1406316,5,B000059HCH,"As with just about everything that is a big time as 'The Ring' is, opinion on it is strongly divided.  Personally, I think it's great, and found it to be very scary on initial viewing, though it has somewhat lost it's ability to scare under repeated viewing. (as films are certain to do)  However, this hasn't dimmed my appreciated for the film any, as I'm not really interested in being scared by a film.  Besides, that's a stupid way to review a film, a what people are frightened by in film seems to be the most difficult to predict thing there is, and reviewing something by those standards will irrevocably color the way the audience views a film, so that they may not be able to appreciate the other aspects of it.  'The Ring' is certainly a horror film, but it's mostly a moody, imagistic horror film, though it still does leap to life at the appropriate moments.  And, I think it's a great horror movie, and a great movie by any standard.  If you haven't actually seen it yet, don't go in expecting to be terrified.  Just go in looking to see an interesting, well-crafted movie.

Although everyone already knows it, I'll give a basic plot summation.  Alright, Rachel's niece, Katie, is killed one night under mysterious circumstances, and Rachel proceeds to investigate into how this might have happened.  She discovers that a number of her friends died at about the same time, and that they viewed a tape just a week earlier, which is rumored to kill you seven days after you view it.  She finds and views the tape, becomes convinced that it is in fact the cause of death, and desperately searches for a solution, particularly after her son Aidan views the tape.  I'll admit it, this is one wacky plot.  I was interested when I saw the ads, and heard some positive reviews from sources I trust, but was still a little worried upon hearing a plot synopsis. I think this is why so many people don't like it- they just can't take the notion of a haunted videotape seriously, and this is a horror film that simply will not work if you can't take it seriously.  It's not just a matter of being scared, it's that some people won't be able to take this seriously even on a simply dramatic level, and the whole film will  just be really silly.  Whether or not you will be able to take it seriously is a question I can't really answer, though I can say that me and all my friends were all concerned about the odd premise, but we all ended up liking it anyway.  So, even if you have doubts about it there's still a chance you can get into it.

The performances are strong, though there generally isn't a whole lot in the way of characterization.  Rachel isn't all that likable, though I do rather like Noah, her estranged boyfriend and the father of Aidan, so there's a certain amount of personal involvement in the film.  Still, the strength of the film is in it's mood and images.  The tape itself is quite cool.  The old random montage of images is something of a clich but they make it work anyway.  There are a number of truly striking images, particularly a large, solitary and vaguely surreal tree, which repeatedly shown at sunset, and a quaint yet extremely creepy and sparse little bedroom in the top of a barn, which can only be accessed by a frightfully tall and old looking ladder .  The film is set in the Pacific northwest, so it is perpetually raining, but it's a dreadful, depressing sort of rain rather than the `scary thunderstorm at night, kinda stuff.  The whole film was blueified, but for once this technique actually works, and it isn't so overdone that the characters look alien.  (See the plotless wonder `Crazy/Beautiful' for a film that has been over-blued for no apparent reason)

There are some powerful set-pieces as well.  The opening scene, depicting Katie's death, is a standard `victim wandering about the empty house' scene, but it works better than most, and is really quite intense.  There is also a powerful, frightening suicide scene and an inexplicable scene involving a horse going wild and killing itself.  And the final horror scene is quite effective, though I won't go into specifics.

Most of all, however, it's just a clever film, displaying connections and multiple meanings, some of which require multiple viewings to uncover.  It displays a nightmare logic, where numerous things connect to each, but we're often uncertain of how or why they do so.  Things they see in the tape are reflected in the real world, sometimes perhaps just a coincidence, other times suggesting an inevitability and lack of control on the part of the protagonists. This is scary, I think, but it's mostly just cool. I would try and go into specifics, but I'm having a tough time describing it, and I suppose it would be better to just see these things yourself.

Well, I've been writing and writing and not done an at all good job of explaining myself, so I'll just screw it, and suffice to say that Kcin highly recommends this movie.  Take that for what it's worth.",1109980800,2,4993,4.5970654627539504

Ana Morgen couldn't have children, that's why she adopted a girl, Samara.

1406348,5,B000059HCH,"This movie scared the *hell* out of me.  And this is coming from someone who was totally unmoved by BLAIR WITCH.  This movie is the scariest one I've seen since SIXTH SENSE, and for pretty much the same reason: rather than going for the grossout, with blood, guts and startle responses, this movie creates and manifests an air of psychological horror, and it does so in a unique way.

*spoilers below*

THE RING was adapted from a Japanese film RINGU, of basically the same plot.  Carried over into the adaptation are some themes common to much Japanese fiction (especially manga and anime) about humanity's relationship with technology--in particular communications technology--and the ambivalent attitudes we have towards tools that at the same time connect and isolate us from each other, and whose functioning we barely understand.  THE RING manages to play on many aspects of this relationship--the anonymity of unseen voices coming over cell phones, what exactly it is the camera captures when pictures are taken, etc.--to excellent, and terrifying effect.

But perhaps the best-expressed and best-thought-out theme is our relationship with television, as both containment and medium for our most powerful urges, a communications tool that modern society is drawn to but often barely seems under our control.  The most striking moment in the film--the moment when Samara ""breaks the fourth wall"" and comes out of the television after Noah--is a stunningly iconic and modern representation of one of humanity's worst and oldest nightmares--the dark side of our psyche, our fantasies and fears, brought to life and running amuck.  In this case, having literally broken out of the safe little box in which they were contained, i.e. the TV set.  If Samara can get out of Noah's television, then perhaps she can get out of the viewer's as well.  And, even more to the point: if *Samara* can get out of the TV set, then what *else* can get out also?

Original, dazzling, and frightening.  Watch it.  You'll never look at your TV set the same way again.

Not only is this scary and creepy, it is also a psychological thriller and mystery movie.  It is actually intelligently written and directed--I think a rarity for the scary movie genre.

The acting is believable and genuine, even the children and teens perform well and add to the climate of fear.

The story takes a few twists and is unpredictable until the very end.  There are no lulls and no resting until the tv is turned off.  As one reviewer intimated, you will need to get religion to get this one out of your system.",1106006400,3,776,4.453900709219858

The sad part is, how many people have seen it and not paid attetion to the story. If so, there would be no complaints of being lost and the movie not making sense. Is it me, or does anyone else see the part where Samara is standing in her cell staring at the clock... and the clock is spinning around and around?? Does anybody realize that they are trying to say that this chick is standing there staring at a clock for like two or three days straight without sleeping or even walking around in a circle??! Nevermind eating... Does anyone hear her tell the doctor that she does NOT want to stop hurting people?? Even more, nobody remembers that Anna Mrogan had like 36 miscarriages...  Focus people!! Anyone who has ever said that they don't understand parts or whatever, please watch the movie again... There are even parts on the ""killer"" video tape that fit together. Of course the falling ladder is the ladder from the barn: The father would keep her trapped up top by laying the ladder down on the ground. She never sleeps because the horses keep her up at night. She started screwing with the horses and drove them insane where they would run to the ocean and drown to get away from her. There is a specific part where you see something like a black cloth or something flicking past the screen really fast. Pay attention.. This is Samara's view from inside the garbage bag while her mom is suffocating her with it before she is thrown in the well... See?

The most respectable part of this movie, is the fact that there are no bloody gore kill scenes; no running through the woods and falling over your own stupidity; no one walking around killing people with everything a movie set has to offer; no cursing.

1406354,5,B000059HCH,"Move over, M. Night Shyamalan....

As many others have written, this film affected me at a deep psychological level. I write horror fiction and have been there and back, through horror, slash and bash, ghost stories, science fiction, and psychological thrillers. All I can say is: move over, M. Night Shyamalan, make room for Gore Verbiniski.

The haunting atmosphere makes this movie more than just a ghost story. Set in a rather rainy and gloomy Pacific Northwest by an excellent cinematographer, it uses a lot of natural light as the better ""X Files"" series did. It is really creepy, eerie and if you aren't shrouded with goose bumps and cold shivers then brother, best check your pulse, you ain't alive.

Some of the scariest films are not blood and gore movies, but atmospheric ghost stories. I was reminded very strongly of my favorites ""The Changeling,"" ""The Good Son,"" ""The Bad Seed,"" ""The Other,"" and most recently ""The Others."" Beyond being a thumping good supernatural thriller, ""The Ring"" is a dark mystery, very dark indeed.

I have not seen ""Ringu,"" the Japanese version, so I am reviewing this film with objective mind and fresh stand-alone feelings and impressions. Carl Jung proposed ""universal archetypes"" that human minds all share, and that is what grabs your mind at a terrifying subconscious level when you view it. It involves us not only with nightmare images we all have (fear of drowning and so forth), but with the creepy side of our technology and our utter druglike dependency on visual stimulation from VHS tapes, TV, computer monitors, theatre movies, DVDs, video games, and on and on.

I am reminded of the inherent warning in the movie ""Videodrome,"" that our technology may consume us. It's as if the creators of subliminal advertising met a psychic little girl ghost and plotted to take over the world...if you watch this, you have seven days to live! With much chagrin, I realized what I saw at the start of the movie (even before the credits or titles, in fact at the very beginning of the VHS tape) was the killer VHS movie of ""The Ring."" Now, I think I'd best mark my calendar and countdown seven days.

And THAT is what is scary and what Verbinski conjures so well: he knows that we scare ourselves, and all a really good director like Verbinski needs to do is take us there, and we can scare ourselves to death.

1406356,4,B000059HCH,"Based upon a Japanese horror film, ""The Ring"" is an extremely well-made example of a psychologically harrowing movie. This film disturbed me more than any I have ever seen, and I can't explain why. I can only say that it haunted me for days after I had seen it, and I was unable to get it out of my head. I wasn't frightened by ""The Ring,"" it disturbed me on a far deeper level than that. It wasn't the film's ""you will die in seven days"" premise, I know that.

Directed by Gore Verbinski, ""The Ring"" tells the story of a cursed videotape that causes the death of anyone who views it. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a hard-nosed reporter raising a young child on her own. She starts investigating the grisly unexplained deaths of several local teenagers, all of who had watched the cursed video. Rachel tracks down a copy and watches it herself. Immediately afterwards, the phone rings, and the voice of a little girl says ""seven days."" The remainder of the movie is a race against time, as Rachel tries to decode the video's terrifying imagery before she dies. Her investigation is aided by her friend and father of her child, Noah, played by Martin Henderson. Together they slowly begin to solve the mystery of the tape, which involves insanity, suicide, and a very disturbed little girl.

A big part of why ""The Ring"" works so well is the exceptional performance of Naomi Watts. She commits fully to the character of Rachel, infusing her with depth and complexity. This makes the film's story much easier to believe, since Watts is so convincing. Martin Henderson, previously seen in the Indie comedy ""The Opposite of Sex,"" is solid as Noah, and Brian Cox is chilling in the supporting role of Robert Morgan. Daveigh Chase is unbelievably creepy as the malevolent Samara, and the actor playing Rachel's young son Aiden also does a credible job.

Gore Verbinski is skilled at creating an atnosphere of almost perpetual dread, aided by cold, ominous cinematography. ""The Ring"" is a movie that I recommend watching alone late at night with all the lights out. Unless of course you want to get any sleep afterwards.",1103673600,,2114,4.708108108108108
1406367,5,B000059HCH,"I have always puzzled over criticisms that this film is a soulless cash-in of a superior Japanese horror film, intended for low attention-span teenagers. While the original RING stands as a intensely horrifying ghost story on its own, it is safe to say that the American remake is its own fresh take on the same story, adding to the horror of the original with thematic complexity and penetrating subtext.

The Japanese RING is effective because of the stark realism and dry terror it evokes; the remake takes the opposite route, taking on a nightmarish and surreal atmosphere. While RING steams forward to the final climax with menacing intensity, THE RING creeps forward with a languid, contemplative pace. Criticisms for being ""slow"" are inevitable, but to those who can appreciate it, THE RING ultimately benefits from the way it languishes on its vivid dreamscapes. One is not likely to forget the shot of the well, bathed in blue, or the leaves lighting up ""as if they were on fire."" But my real point in writing this review is to praise the excellent adaptation this film is of its Japanese counterpart. Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger adds his own version to the legend behind the tape, replacing psychics with unnatural conceptions, and scandal with tragedy. Kruger also adds layers to the film, introducing arcing themes about parental responsiblity, the needs of children, and empathy.

Parenthood is examined in a number of places in the film. Naomi Watts' character, a crass and insensitive journalist, is also an uncaring mother, not wanting to acknowledge the distance between her and her son. Martin Henderson's Noah is a deadbeat dad, afraid of taking responsibility of the child. Jane Alexander, as the Moesko Island doctor, talks to Watts about her mentally retarded grandson. ""We loved him anyway,"" she says. ""It takes work. Some people have limits."" She is indirectly talking about the Morgans, whose daughter shows us the worst-case scenario of becoming a parent. The extent to which they go when dealing with their child is horrifying. Aidan and Samara have a subtle relationship in that they are both victims of parents struggling with their role as parents. It is finally the curse that leads Rachel Keller to take full role as a mother, and the empathy she creates with the plight of the neglected daughter Samara Morgan ultimately reflects on her own son. Naomi Watts does a fine job of showing the growth her character makes, conveying real sadness and sensitivity as the film progresses, especially in the final scene. The look in her face when the movie ""fades to black,"" so to speak, hits home the moral crisis the film ends with.

There is a lot more to this film than one would think. The final climax with the television has its own dark edge, even with the superior climax of the Japanese RING edging it out. The final scene brings up a moral dilemma, though, that rivals the original in resonance.

For added insight, watch the DON'T WATCH THIS feature on the DVD. There is one scene between Rachel and her sister Ruth that should not have been cut from the film: their conversation reflects directly another mother-child relationship and how ""involved"" a parent should be with their children.

In summation, 'The Ring' is a bleak and beautiful horror film with a strong emotional core; a commentary on parents, children, compassion, and the media's lack thereof (""What is it with reporters?  They take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it.  They spread it like sickness.""  Examine that quote.  It sums up the curse in three sentences).

A great film, one of the best horror films in years.  9/10.",1103673600,3,3648,4.915447154471544

1406369,5,B000059HCH,"Oh god! Why do I do this to myself! This film has freaked me out!!! Give me gore, I don't flinch, but give me supernatural and I quake with fear. This movie seems to have been made with my greatest fears inside. I can relate to this so much!!! Have a look at this list!

1. My name is Rachel

2. I'm claustrophobic, in fact I can't close my eyes in the shower I'm that bad, so you can imagine what I would be like stuck down a well

3. I'm scared of the dark. I always sleep with a light on (I'm not a kid either)

4. I'm scared of horses. I used to horse-ride as a kid and due to many falls and bites I have concluded there is something about me they don't like.

5. I'm scared of televisions when they are tuned off, because they reflect the room in a weird way

6. I'm scared of mirrors

7. I'm scared of getting electrocuted in the bathtub.

The list goes on.

So you can imagine how scared I was. I have re-occurring nightmares. It's my thing. After I saw the ring I dreamt for a week that sadako (the Japanese version, I've seen both) was sat on the edge of my bed. Also I have a TV in my room and now I can't sleep facing it. I still see things in the reflection. Okay I'm a mess. This film has really frightened me and even as I'm typing this review I'm feeling uneasy. I just want to make some comparisons between the American and Japanese version. In the Japanese version I think that sadako was much scarier. The fact that she was a grown woman was more threatening, also you never saw her face and there is nothing more scarier then the unknown. Also the to screen at the end was more realistic because she looked real. In the American version samara was all blue and grainy but sadako is totally natural. You could really see her red fingertips where the nails had been ripped off. Also the crawl across the floor was much slower and more heart pounding. Plus she's just plain evil, with no explanation as to why. I'm getting scared again, the computer just clicked. However I like Noah in the American version. He's really hot. He he. The visuals and music are much creepier in the American version as well. I can't compare the scared faces as I closed my eyes at that part. I always do. In fact I had to see the movie 5 times before I had the courage to look at samara's face at the end. I'm glad I did because she looks like me when I'm cross. Didn't scare me. Did I mention I have hair just like her that tends to fall over my face?

Anyway this film is very scary if you have a very overactive imagination and tend to get creeped out by the supernatural. You have been warned. I'm not going to put how many times I have glanced over my shoulder when writing this. Cue creepy scraping music, I'm gone.",1103155200,5,2718,4.130681818181818

1406389,4,B000059HCH,"This was a really good American-ified remake of an excellent Japanese movie.  The original, Ringu, was awesome but actually took some research from me to understand it.  It delved heavily into their cultures mysticism.  America doesn't have much, I mean, Hollywood, so they just use the sterotypical supernatural stuff.  This is one of the better horror movies to come out amongst those terrible teen slasher movies.

What is the ring?  What is the significance of the various part of the video?  Who is the little girl?  What happened to her?  IS the tape really a message?  All that and more will be answered.

Ringu relies heavily on an understanding of Japanese culture and mysticism, and so a lot of it went way over my head. The Ring caters to my need to have things make sense in the end, even if all questions aren't answered. Too much didn't make sense to me about Ringu. To me, the scariest part of horror movies is when the Awful Realization hits you- the Rosebud moment. That moment never really came with Ringu for me, but it did with The Ring. Also, the cinematography in The Ring, as well as the music, the grisly but brief shocks and the false-bottom ending all came together into a very disturbing experience that kept bothering me for days after I watched it. Now I've seen it enough times so it doesn't freak me out as much, but I'm always left uncomfortable and paranoid after a viewing.

1406413,5,B000059HCH,"Gore Verbinski obviously knows how to tweak the human psyche, and although I have never actually seen 'Ringu,' I can honestly say I'm sure I'd prefer the English version.

'The Ring' follows the story of a young reporter (Watts) and her boyfriend's search to uncover the truth behind a creepy (and I don't use that word lightly) videotape that killed her neice, among others who died seven days after seeing it.

Watts performance is suprisingly beleivable as the terrified and curious reporter; Henderson is nicely cast as the lesser role of the timid boyfriend; and poor little David Dorfman tries hard as the troubled son, but who's performance is vaguely reminiscent of the crayon prophet girl in ""Children of the Corn.""

The camerawork was beautifully in-sync with the killer rollercoaster of a plot, the music makes the experienece worthwhile, and the eerie blue lighting suits the horror theme as the yellow-red light does in 'Lost Souls.' Such techniques are both atmospherically and hauntingly intentional. Thanks, Gore.

The symbolism used in 'The Ring' is out of this world, latching to a masterfully constructed plot, although Verbinski was not the original creator of the story, neither were the producers of the Chinese film. Actually, Ringu is based on a Chinese novel. So 'The RING' is a remake--so what? It scared the bejesus out of me and my family!

I dare any reader of this review: Buy this, rent this, do what you must, but SEE 'THE RING' AS SOON AS YOU'RE ABLE! It will change the way you watch your horror videos.

This movie was based on the Japanese movie Ringu, which I have also seen, and I think the screenwriters did a good job of revising the movie into something that would be accessible to American viewers, while preserving the spirit and themes of the original.

As modern horror films indulge in grotesque but tiresome bloodbaths, THE RING manages to fill the screen with a gloomy dread and a few good shocks.  The cast is excellent (I think Naomi Watts is one of the best actresses in movies these days) and the direction is tight and driven.

I rented the original Japanese film, RINGU, on which this version is based, and enjoyed it as well.  It'll probably depend on which you see first as far as which you'll like better, but it's worth doing if you liked the story.

I watched this movie (came across it by accident) in broad daylight in a hotel room in the middle of a large city, and it has not left my mind for four days. It was absolutely the most terrifying movie I have ever seen, especially the actual videotape they play in the movie. I was scared while the sun was streaming in my window and people were walking by outside; I'm probably sounding silly here, and I'm no teenager, but it terrified me to the point where I was jumping at my own reflection as I watched it ;) I can't say anything else except that I love good horror, I love being creeped out in a way that isn't physical or needs blood and guts to get you scared: this is a movie to disturb your mind, for sure.

1406432,4,B000059HCH,"Once in a great while, quality horror movies come around that re-invent the wheel and discover new methods to terrify us in ways previously unimaginable.  Where most other films steal ideas or disappoint with bad acting or a lame story (or both), the genuine ones tend to use a unique concept that is miraculously capable of suspending our disbelief even long after this film's end.  These movies typically have very memorable scenes that engrave unforgettable images people will talk about time and time again.  Soon after, what was once a small little horror film becomes a timeless classic.  THE RING (which is a remake of the Japanese film RINGU) is definitely one of these movies.

** SPOILER ALERT **

The plot is relatively simple, but is executed very well.  A mysterious video is circulating around.  Once the video is seen by someone, that person receives a phone call letting them know they have 7 days left to live.  On the 7th day, those who have watched the video apparently die a horrible death (even their facial expressions just before they die are ""locked"" that reveals how horrified the victims were just before it happened).

An investigator (Naomi Watts) takes personal interest in researching this phenomenon while finding clues to the puzzle along the way.  She discovers the video and decides to watch it for herself (we also get to view the entire video).  The video is very unsettling and does an excellent job in spooking the audience.  The phone call inevitably happens and now the audience is rooting for the investigator to solve the puzzle before her time runs out.

The movie holds our interest tightly as pieces of the puzzle are discovered while other new questions are risen.  There are also a lot of wonderful, yet subtle techniques used to further intensify the mood:

  1.  The foreshadowing of the fly peeling off the monitor.  After watching this movie several times now, I also noticed the fly's movement pattern exactly matched the fly found in the records' storage area.

  2.  The documentary footage of Samara's clinical studies further elevated the film's legitimacy.  That was a very nice touch as it also made the audience sympathize with Samara even more.

  3.  The blurred faces on the unfortunate viewers of the cursed video amptly suggested how the people themselves were now cursed.

  4.  The horse scene was quite a shocker, and a bit disturbing too!  Another one of those ""memorable images"" engraved in my mind now.

  5.  Even more disturbing were the flashbacks of Samara's death and the method in how she died.  I felt the intensity of many scenes of this movie alone was enough to push its rating to ""R"" level even though there was almost no blood or gore.  I feel THE RING pushes the envelope on PG-13 the same way I felt POLTERGEIST pushed the envelope on PG during its day.

  6.  How the video itself is linked to key locations that the reporter finds as she tries to finish her investigation in time.

** END SPOILER ALERT **

This movie was very well constructed and will easily please both the casual and the more critical detail-oriented moviegoer.  The movie's pacing builds to a nice crescendo and it doesn't fall victim to overused clich&eacute;s.  Just when you think it was about to, another surprise is in store!  I have seen both the Japanese and the American versions and they are nearly identical in quality.  The story is exactly the same, and the American version follows the original very closely.  There are a few minor differences but my impression was that the Japanese version was slightly more subtle, but I wouldn't rate either to be significantly better or worse.  For those who would ask which one to see, I would recommend watching both, but to see the American version first as it definitely has better production value (both are about equally scary).

I would also like to comment on Charles' comments regarding the floating microphone.  That anomaly is NOT present in the DVD nor the theater where I first saw the movie.  It is funny you should mention this problem as several years ago the same thing happened to me during another movie I saw, so I can relate to how it ruined the experience.  Believe me when I say it was the theater's fault as the 35mm print is uncropped and all they had to do was adjust the film on the projector so that it was properly centered.",1093737600,2,4361,4.733688415446072

So the day in came out, she went ang got the widescreen edition. She really wanted to show this movie to me, so, she made me wacth it in her bedroom, in the basemen, lights out, volume up loud, on the laptop.
This movie was really scary.
Those burned and melted faces were really disturbing.
I fel so sorry for Samara.
I had nightmares for the longest time ever.

Wen Samara is slowly crawling out of the TV, I was absolutely stunned.
If you have seen the deleted 20 minute short film by Gore Verbinski that reveals more secrets about The Ring adds more suspense.

1406434,2,B000059HCH,"Whilst Verbinski's remake of Nakata's classic is reasonably faithful (albeit mixing in few anachronistic elements from Ring 2 and Ring 0) it clearly lacks the visceral impact of the original.

Firstly, switching the locale from Japan to Seattle greatly dilutes the atmosphere and rather diminishes the overall effect. Furthermore, Verbinski has pasted in a number of irrelevant scenes, which are little more than an irritating distraction, whilst skipping over some of the more atmospheric scenes from the original.

Sure the movie is still an effective and thought-provoking horror, but that is entirely due to the magnificence of the original.

Even the famous shock ending seems rushed here and feels spoiled.

The storyline is proabaly the only good thing about this movie.  It wasn't scary, and after awhile it never really went any where.  You only see the girl kill two people, and you never actually ""see"" her do it, which angered me immensly.  Also the so called payoff ending of this movie was also dissapointing, after watching all of this amazing storyline filled movie, and figuring out all of the secrets, the best Gore Verbanski could come up with for an ending was having the girl come out of the Tv and show her move anround some guys house for a few seconds of footage?  I was expecting some much more, and was largly dissapointed, I wanted to be scared and I wasn't.

1406439,5,B000059HCH,"Now I am fully aware that some aspects of The Ring don't fit together very well but for christ's sake, it's only a movie. Nowhere does it state that movies are supposed to be an accurate interpretation of real life (apart from those films that claim to be based on a true story).Anyway, The Ring is as good a horror movie you'll ever come across. It succeeds in being both highly entertaining and genuinely frightening at the same time. The storyline can get confusing at times but surely that's better than a simplistic approach? The imagery in the film is great- it's really shocking how something so simple can play with your mind for so long. I also liked the colour in which the film was shot in- lots of dull tones. The acting was as you'd expect- generally believable but somewhat monotone at times. Obviously with it being a movie you expect events to be exaggerated as I'm sure many people would not do the same things that Rachel (the main character) does.

I will not claim to have seen the original Ring so I cannot make comparisons but if it is scarier than this version then it must be pretty damn great. Considering this is a remake it has been highly successful and The Ring as a film proves that you don't need large doses of violence to create a decent horror flick.

1406454,3,B000059HCH,"Gore Verbinski's THE RING is the classic example of a film that is all style and very little, if any, substance. Verbinski certainly knows how to make a creepy horror film: this film is laced with atmosphere and dread and gray skies. Technically, it is quite impressive. It's too bad that all the skillful visuals are put in the service of a really dumb plot---or, at least, that's the way it turns out. Perhaps the idea of a videotape killing people could make a good horror film---but when the screenplay by Ehren Kruger starts trying to explain how the videotape was made and then how to dilute the videotape's power, this movie just became plain stupid for me. How could anyone be duped into blindly accepting this kind of silliness? I suppose, though, that that is a very subjective reaction and that some people might find its visuals and atmosphere effective enough to accept the film without a second thought. Still, I remember that John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN never really provided an explanation for Michael Myers' motives (except, of course, that ""he's crazy""), and I think that perhaps horror movies shouldn't be so burdened with having to explain the horror in them---it should merely be felt, since film is such a visual medium anyway (leave explanations to writers, hehe). In the case of THE RING, we feel the horror, but we also feel a plot that strains to explain itself, and ends up merely being laughable instead (especially that final twist, which I had difficulty swallowing). If Kruger hadn't tried so hard, maybe this would have turned out to be a highly effective horror film instead one that made me wonder what the heck the horse in the middle of the film had to do with anything. I think THE RING is viscerally creepy enough that it earns its three stars here, but all of Verbinski's style cannot hide the fact that, plotwise, this film is a mess, and I certainly don't plan on seeing this film's intended sequel whenever it comes out.",1090022400,3,1961,4.7368421052631575

After watching that movie, which I rented in a video store and watched it with my wife. I was having nightmares and sweating because of that little girl from the well.
Her long black hair that covers her face was just too wicked. She reminded me of the girl from the exorcist.
When she came out of the T.V and scared the hell out of that one dude- She zoomed in at him and he jumped off-That part made my heart pump really fast and made my hair turn white.

1406489,5,B000059HCH,"It's difficult to explain why The Ring is so scary. Yes, as people have pointed out, parts of the plot are a bit implausible, and if you were in this situation in real life somehow, there are any number of things you could do to save yourself. It also bows to a couple of traditional horror-movie contrivances, and that little Sixth Sense-ripoff kid is so annoying you want to reach into the screen and strangle him. But what makes it so good, I think, is that it succeeds in spite of all that. It's like the old monster-under-the-bed fear; even though you know, rationally, that there is no monster under the bed, you still don't want to put your feet on the floor.  Even knowing the secret behind the plot (I had read the book before I saw the movie) doesn't make it any easier to bear. It's not scary because it makes you consider that you yourself could be killed by an angry ghost. That's not why horror movies work. It's scary because it was so well-made, and because the idea behind it is so powerful. It creates a situation which isn't just dependant on moments of specific horror, like ghosts suddenly popping out of the walls, to shock the viewer, but on a _situation_ which is so horrible that it leaves an indelible impression on you, and on images which are truly grotesque. It says a lot about the movie that (minor potential spoiler) that scene in which the ghost herself finally appears is one of the least scary in the movie. In the end, I thought the somehow stripped-down plot of the movie was much, much more frightening than the book, even if it lacked some of the book's philosophical substance.",1088121600,,1617,4.5

  The first one was, they never explained who calls and says that you're going to die in seven days.  The second one was, they never explained who made the tape?  The biggest problem with this movie is, I was really wondering what would happen if the person who watched the tape was next to a very small TV on the seventh day.  I mean, how would the girl fit through the screen?  The last problem I had with this movie was, what would happen if you out in the middle of nowhere, where there wasn't a TV for miles in each direction.  How would the girl come and kill you.
  This movie is scary, not extremely.  I saw this movie when I was barely twelve and I didn't even flinch.  So if your not too sure you want to see it because everybody said that it was so horrifying, then take my advice and see it anyway because it isn't even as scary as ""The Sixth Sense.""

The imagery and stark photography was enough, but coupled with phenomenal acting and an ending that simply blows your mind, this is definitely one of the best psychological horror films I have ever seen. The cold atmosphere and confusing story result in a very effective and thought-provoking film.
 Verbinski's camera-work and directing on this film are simply unmatched by most modern filmmakers in the genre.
 Overall, this is an extremely terrifying and intelligent film. I would not reccomend it to anyone who does not like to think about what they are watching.",1085961600,,735,5.116666666666666
1406496,1,B000059HCH,"Whenever this movie first came out, all of my friends were telling me how it was one of the scariest movies ever. I thought I needed to see it, also. However, when I watched it, I kept on waiting for a scary part. That scary part never came. This movie sucked. The only thing remotely scary about it was the videotape that the people watched.
Not only was this movie not scary, but it was a complete waste of my time. The plot was not one that held my interest at all. And the parts where the girl would call them up on the phone? Give me a break.
Another thing that bothered me was how the victims died. They looked at the little girl through the T.V. and died. That's right, all they had to do was look at her, and they died. If you ask me, that's a pretty nice and peaceful way to die. I would keep the videotape untill I was old. Then I'd pop it in and seven days later, I die a good death. The movie would be a lot better if the girl would have came out of the T.V. and mutilated the people instead but no, that's too much voilence for the pussy society of today.
You should skip this movie if your wanting to get scared and actually watch a real disturbing movie, like the Exorcist. Or perhaps read some Stephen King novels. Just don't expect too much from The Ring.",1085875200,6,1272,4.092

This movie is a psychological thriller that will keep you up thinking about it.  You will have to watch The Ring multiple times to catch everything this mystery has to offer.  I am 13 and love scary things and i had heard that this movie was the scariest thing ever.  But when i watched it i found that it was definately creepy but more of a mystery movie than a horror.  I think that this movie has an amazing plot that will keep you entwined all the way.  The only thing i disliked about The Ring on DVD was that it included NO special features or deleted scenes.

You would think by now that Hollywood could figure out that lots of outrageous gore and naked women is not the way to make a movie that actually scares people. This movie is rated PG-13, and after seeing it I had to sleep with the lights on for a week. This move is filled with atmosphere and tension that keeps building up as the mystery of the ring is revealed. Naomi Watts is excellent as the main character, a reporter named Rachel Keller. I hope Watts continues to do more work like this, and not more garbage like Mulholland Drive. This is probably the best horror movie to have come out in literally years, with the possible exception of some of M. Night Shyamalan's.

1406525,5,B000059HCH,"The slasher films that have been around since the late 1970s have never really scared me.  Sure Jason and Freddy were kind of creepy and could come up with some really interesting ways to kill people, but there was just something about them that didn't scare me and keep me up all night.  The movies that always scared me were the ones that messed with your head and you couldn't figure out what in the hell was happening.  ""The Ring"" is definitely one of those kinds of movies.
A brief summary of the plot is easy to do.  There's a videotape and if you watch it, you will die.  You watch it, then the phone rings, and then a spooky voice tells you that you have seven days to live.  That's a freaky enough premise as it is, but when Naomi Watts' character starts trying to decipher the tape and figure out what it means, the events that follow just makes things even more bizarre.
I didn't see ""The Ring"" when it was in theaters, but I heard all the buzz about it.  I watched the movie as soon as it came out on DVD and there were some very disturbing things going on in this movie.  Everytime you think your getting closer to figuring out what the deal with the videotape is, something happens and some of it is truly unnerving (ie. the bath one of the characters takes at the end or the horse on the boat).  Plus, just when I thought the movie was done and everything had been resolved, I looked at the counter on my DVD player and realized that there's still another fifteen minutes of movie left.  What happens at the end still blows my mind!
Oh, and just a warning, if you're one of those people who like to go hunting around for easter eggs on DVDs, you may want to save the hunt for another disc.  If you find the egg on this movie, you'll get to see the entire video without the ability to stop, fast forward, or pause it.  Very freaky!",1083715200,2,1845,4.2250712250712255
1406526,5,B000059HCH,"Back in early 2001, I heard buzz that there would be a remake of the Japanese Ringu.  I couldn't wait.  I'll never forget the summer day when I walked into the theatres and saw the first theatrical trailer for The Ring.  It was so eerie and foreboding; very well done.  I was going out of my mind with anticipation.  I knew this film was going to be good.  Everyone I talked to in the time after I saw the trailer, and even before when the project was first announced, had no idea what I was talking about.  But eventually I downloaded the trailer and, little by little, I showed it to all my friends as they came over.  Everyone was blown away by the preview alone.  It surprised me because, here I had been waiting for this movie for over a year and yet no one else had even heard about it.  I showed the preview to another close friend and she was immediately hooked.  We made plans to go see it and when the theatrical release came, I took her.  Needless to say, we were both amazed.  Simple fact is - This film is one of the greatest horror movies to come out of America in quite some time.  From the Scream teeny bopper crap of the nineties, to the absolutely disappointing failures of the Final Destination and Hannibal movies, American cinema had no horror left worth mentioning.  All we had was a scant offering of luke-warm, dull slashers that lacked the suspense and true dread of their horror predecessors.  America needed a good ol' fashion terror invoking horror flick, and The Ring answered the call.  This movie does not disappoint.  It is genuinely creepy and very well put together.  The cinematography and music alone make this movie a triumph.  The Ring is dark, grainy, and without a doubt unnerving.  The acting is top notch all the way from Naomi Watts down to little Daveigh Chase who plays Samara (evil little dead girl with a penchant for killing from beyond the grave)  Any bad buzz that you may have heard about this movie is stale and hardly worth mentioning.  This is as good as American horror films get.  The people who complain about this movie over-analyze and base their objections about the film on ridiculously trivial facets of the movie's mechanics. - You can tell that they're really digging to find bad points.  This is a movie experience that will you leave you a bit rattled and maybe even leaving the light on for a few nights when you hit the sack.  (Don't be ashamed; I was 18 when I first saw this film -  The night after I watched it I had to turn my  bedroom TV around so that the screen faced the wall.)  What's truly great about this movie is that it has a little thing I like to call `sleeper-terror.'  What I mean by that is: The full effect of the movie's psychological horror doesn't hit you at first.  But in the proceeding days after viewing the film, you think more about it and discover additional things that creep you out.  Aside form the sleeper-terror, there are several scenes in the film that are extremely disturbing right off the bat.  This film definitely delivers in the terror department.  I give it five stars and a full recommendation.  So dig through the festering heaps of crap-horror titles and embrace The Ring. - It's a  remarkable American horror film with rich Eastern roots.  DO NOT pass up this movie.",1083456000,2,3282,4.483108108108108
1406527,3,B000059HCH,"This is the American remake of a Japanese movie, based on Japanese novels and manga, or adult comic books.  It is post modern, cynical, and basically juvenile in nature, and as such appeals to huge, numberless hoardes of people out there.  The images are shocking, terrifying, unforgettable...but the plot has holes you could throw a cat through.  This doesn't really matter, though, because its intended audience isn't a product of the literary genre, but rather the visual one.  Therefore, it's a film based on images rather than story line.
 A young girl becomes a ghost when she is killed by her own mother by being thrown down a well.  This ghost chooses a modern and highly technical way of avenging herself: victims must make copies of video tapes to avoid being killed.  This odd melding of the spiritual with the technical sheds a little light onto the distorted origins of this tale.  The fact that we aren't told vast amounts of explanatory material, that we don't know (in the end) anything about anyone in this film, that there is no moral, that there is no resolution, that motive and causation are left out of the mix, matters not a whit.  The modern audience isn't trained to look for these things, so it doesn't miss them when they're gone.  Give people gorgeous, shocking images, and they're happy - they'll grin from ear to ear.
 I give it 3 stars because it's genuinely very scary, and scary in new ways that I've really not seen before.  The ""cursed video"" that everyone watches is extremely upsetting, in the same way the the film ""Jacob's Ladder"" was.  The nightmare of the murder and the ordeal in the well fill our minds with horrible images.  So on purely technical grounds, it's a solid effort. But the fact that movies like this make us feel frightened, disoriented, alone, bereft, harmed, confused...none of that seems to bother anyone.  Why do we seek out ""entertainment"" that assaults us?  No easy answers.
  ""The Ring"" has, of course, achieved cult status, and all the gaping plot flaws and confusing omissions (I don't know how many times I said ""HUH??"" during this movie) are neatly filled in by lots of confabulating fans filling in the details. In fact, the less you tell kids these days, the more they like it - it lets them spend weeks on the internet researching nonsense, basically writing your story for you as they go.  But who cares?  All I'm left with is the very pained, nauseated feeling that I watched a movie about a child that was thrown down a well and whose ghost is now horribly murdering innocent people, and many people think this is a profitable use of their time, that they derived enjoyment from it, that they are better for the experience.

1406550,1,B000059HCH,"Where shall we begin?  As a lifelong and avid fan of genre films, this has to be one of the most overrated and disappointing movies I have ever seen.  I'm not a horror film elitist, all I ask for is a decent story and at least a few scares or squirms.  To summarize:
1. Naomi Watts-superb actor, she can do (and has done) so much better than this (Mulholland Dr., anyone?).

2. Plot & story-where are they?  So full of holes you could drain pasta with it (do any screenwriters actually work in Hollywood any longer?  or have they all given up and left the writing duties to the mailroom staff?).  This is VERY puerile stuff here, adults beware.
3. Scare factor: on a scale of 1-10, ZERO.  0 suspense, 0 surprises, 0 credibility, and especially, 0 horror.  This film simply is not scary, not at all, never for a moment.
4. Mama always told me: never put anything down unless you can come up with a better solution.  SO--here are some recommendations for smart, interesting, intelligent, well-written and especially FRIGHTENING genre/horror films:
*The Devil's Backbone (Guillermo Del Toro): now THIS is scary!
*Don't Look Now (Nicolas Roeg): the most haunting, beautifully-shot (in Venice) and erotic horror film ever made.  Just try to forget this one.
*The Hills Have Eyes (Wes Craven): visionary and still shocking.
*The Haunting (Robert Wise--the original, not the ridiculous modern remake): the best and most frightening ghost story EVER, period.
*The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tobe Hooper): unrelenting, claustrophobic, sweat-inducing and repulsive.  This is an iconic and endlessly-imitated masterpiece, right up there with George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead.""  The recent remake (if not compared directly to the original) is NOT BAD, actually....

*The Mothman Prophecies (Mark Pellington): YUP, believe it or not, this is a tight, though confusing (you absolutely must read the book by John Keel prior to seeing this film) and above all VERY frightening and unsettling bit of business.  Highly recommended for those looking for something different and a bit.....off.
*Repulsion (Roman Polanski): The granddaddy....if this one doesn't disturb you on a very deep and lasting level, I would worry.  ""Rosemary's Baby,"" also Polanski, is another winner and timeless classic.  Actually, ANYTHING Polanski is better than most of what's out there.
My humble opinion: check out the movies listed above and avoid ""The Ring""--annoying, unnecessarily oblique, and just plain dumb-dumb.  Avoid.",1082419200,9,2495,5.195
1406551,4,B000059HCH,"The ring is best described as a horror film. It is definitely a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Rachel goes through anything and everything to piece together how her niece died. She even drives long hours and talks to people she has never met before. As well as looking on the internet for more information.

The Ring was an excellent movie that taunted all sense of logic and became one of the greatest psychological thrillers I have seen.
On most normal occasions when I watch a horror/suspense movie I know what to expect. Some cliche hour and a half film where if you've seen one you've seen them all. This was different. Movies don't scare me and they hardly ever make me tense up. While The Ring didn't actually scare me, it made me tense up and jump plenty and I was thinking about it all the rest of the night.
The plot consist of this: you watch a haunted video tape and you die within seven days. Great idea? Not really but the movie does work quite well with it and the end result is something you won't soon forget.
I can't garuntee you'll love (I've heard people say they love it and hate it) but as far as horror movies go, The Ring is most certainly a treat to break the rest of the bland, cliche 'horror' flicks.",1081468800,,1093,4.184834123222749

I'm a big horror fan (heck, my twenty-fifth birthday party had a ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" theme), but I simply could not buy into this premise - a killer video tape?  I mean, give me killer dolls any day over that.  What's next, murderous spatulas?  Killer quiches?  Honestly.

1406555,4,B000059HCH,"For those who like their horror with spurting blood and ear-piercing screams, ""The Ring"" will disappoint since its disturbing eeriness stems more from  psychological tension and creepy images.  That's not to say it doesn't have its gory moments, though.  Naomi Watts plays Rachel, a reporter, who sets out to decipher why her teenage niece died unexpectedly.  When she hears rumors of a deadly videotape, she tracks it down and watches it alone in a cabin.  The tape itself is not frightening - not at first; it's a surreal collage of striking, bizarre images.  But immediately after seeing it, Rachel receives a phone call that sets everything in motion.
The pacing is superb as no scene, no moment is wasted.  Director Verbinski makes sure that the viewer must pay attention to every word, and this intense demand on the viewer increases the tension.  The videotape itself evolves as the film does, making its initial strangeness transform into real horror.  As Rachel discovers the meaning of each image, the suspense mounts, especially when her friend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her small son Aidan (David Dorfman) become involved. Watts does an admirable job keeping her character grounded and real, and that goes a long way in upping the stakes for the viewer.  Little David Dorfman plays her adorable but creepy son Aidan with just the right amount of wide-eyed expression and deadpan delivery.  Just wait until the next time you slip a VHS tape into a player, or flick on the television.  You will immediately be taken back to this film with a small jolt.
This chilling film relies heavily on atmosphere and anticipation to evoke its horror.  Watch it at night in a darkened room for maximum creepiness.  Viewers with overactive imaginations will be freaked out, and shouldn't watch it alone. Skip this, however, if you don't find cinematic mind games creepy enough.  Although most people won't find ""The Ring"" heart-palpitating terrifying, they will come away from its viewing with its disturbing eeriness under their skin.",1080950400,40,2033,5.044910179640719

That little girl is creepy creepy creepy, and there are 3 parts of the movie where it caught me by surprise.  I watched the movie the first time through peered fingers, and I still couldn't sleep for a week.  Compared to ""Ringu"", I like this version much much better because everything about it feels like a well-put-together movie.  ""Ringu"" was the original, yes, but it just wasn't creepy like ""The Ring"".  ""Ringu"" had its 1 or 2 creepy moments but that's it.

1406582,2,B000059HCH,"Like so many horror films of recent vintage,  ""The Ring"" is far more effective in its setup than it is in its execution.
The film starts off with a promising premise.  A group of teenagers watch a mysterious videotape that predicts that each of them will die in seven days.  When the prophecy turns out to be true, Rachel, the aunt of one of the victims, decides to do some investigating of her own to uncover the facts behind this strange supernatural phenomenon.  The problem is that not only has Rachel herself seen the tape (which looks for all the world like outtakes from ""Un Chien Andalou""), but so also have her ex-boyfriend and little son.  Her search for answers thus becomes a matter of life-and-death not merely for herself but for her loved ones as well.
""The Ring"" has some nice moments of suspense right up front, but the more Rachel unravels the mystery the less mysterious and terrifying the film becomes.  This seems to be a common failing in many horror films and ""The Ring"" finds no real way to overcome it.  Naomi Watts is energetic and attractive as the feisty heroine of the story, but the clues she uncovers just aren't very interesting or compelling.  ""The Ring"" is competently made and nicely atmospheric at times, but it doesn't get under your skin the way the best horror films invariably do.  Perhaps it's because the tape itself ceases to become a threat early on once the three main characters have all had a crack at watching it.  All we are left to do is watch Rachel racing against the clock looking for answers, turning ""The Ring"" into more of a whodunit mystery than a tale of terror.  This might be acceptable if the ""solution"" weren't a hackneyed bit of Grand Guignol idiocy that we've seen hundreds of times before.
""The Ring"" is a watchable little time waster but it won't keep you up at night and it won't make you think twice before popping that next videotape into your VCR.",1079136000,4,1917,4.576023391812866
1406583,5,B000059HCH,"Finally, the Japanese horror flick Ringu meets the American horror culture, and the results are better than one would expect.
In this movie, Naomi Watts, plays the character of a reporter who is doing a research on a videotape, that is said to have caused the death of the all the people that watched it , exactly seven days after they originally saw it. She gets to know the case, due to  the sudden and inexcplicable death of her sister's daughter, and as she goes deeper and deeper into a case she considered a prank from the beginning, she understands that strange forces are at work.
As she searches more and more on the videotape images she comes across a woman called Anna Frank, a horse breeder who, with her husband, had adopted a girl, named Samara. However, things were not as the couple had expected and the girl somehow drove the woman insane. And here is the big question mark. How does this little girl fit into this whole case? How could girl's gift (or rather, curse) get into a normal videotape?
The Ring, is not your average slasher movie like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. It's a really clever, and ""deep"" movie, and unlike most movies, it requires from you to watch it carefully , because everything means something.

The videotape was a weird tape that was supposed to be about a girl trying to express herself to the world after having a bad childhood. The videotape was located at cabin at a local inn right above the girl's watery prison. Her adopted father commited sucicide shortly after a visit from the reporter. Her nephew who seems to be possessed draws pictures of the ring from the videotape. She and her boyfriend uncover that their pictures get messed up after they watched the tape.

1406594,5,B000059HCH,"This movie is scary.  The scenes are creepy, and the atmosphere really wrecked my nerve. However, the most scary point to me is about the pure evil mind of a child.

She tried to crawl back on.  Eventually all hopes were gone, she died lonely in the dark.  I'd like to kill a bunch of people to release my agony if I were in her place.
However, that is not the reason she kill.  Neither is it the reason Rachel's being saved, more accurately, spared.  At the end, we learned that Samara kill because she likes to kill.  You think she spared Rachel because Rachel bring her back on earth, so she can peacefully rest in peace? No, just because Rachel bring more prey for her.  That is it.

But as the story progresses and the viewer is trying to piece everything together, it slowly becomes apparent that ""The Ring"" is just not going to deliver.
There is enough plot explanation in the other reviews here, so I won't talk about it.  All I will say is that in the end, one is left thinking that the entire premise is flimsy and unexplained.  This is hardly unexpected for a horror flick, but all the gloss on this film leads the viewer to expect more, not more of the same.

What a dumb idea. How was the tape made? Why was it made? Why would a ghost be using a tape to kill people for no apparent reason? Suddenly, the ghost becomes evil at the end and kills the main character's boyfriend. Then the main character decides to make more copies of the tape! Why? The acting wasn't bad, but that doesn't help really. I recommmend these movies: John Carpentar's The Thing, They Live, The Fog, In The Mouth of Madness, Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser. Those are really great horror/science fiction movies.

Naomi Watts gives a noteable performance as a reporter trying to uncover the secret behind the videotape that makes people die seven days after they see it. What she doesn't expect to happen is that her young son will watch the video. Luckily she sees him do this so she can hopefully expel the death that is coming after her son.

1406600,4,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" opens with a scene that looks exactly like the opening scene of every slasher movie. Two teenage girls are at home alone, watching TV; one of them brings up a rumor about a cursed videotape that kills you seven days after you watch it; the other girl goes pale and reveals that she saw a weird videotape a week ago; etc. The scene moves along a familiar arc -- creepy sounds, a couple false alarms, and finally a violent death. However, it does not end with a psychopath jumping out of a closet, but with a fleeting glimpse of a grainy image on the victim's TV screen. And right away the movie has our interest, because we're wondering, ""What did we just see, and why did it literally scare her to death?""
We meet the dead girl's aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a harried reporter/single mom who begins investigating this supposed killer videotape. Her search leads her to a campground in the mountains, where she does indeed find a mysterious unmarked cassette. She watches it; it is filled with strange images such as a shimmering ring of light, a ladder, a woman falling off a cliff, severed fingers, etc. Then the phone rings, and a whispered voice tells her she has seven days to live.
With the clock ticking, Rachel races to uncover the mystery of the tape. Who made it, and how? Who is the strange woman who appears on the tape? In her hunt for answers, Rachel enlists the help of her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), a computer geek who spouts techo-jargon and ominously informs her, ""This tape has no data code. That's like a person born without fingerprints."" There's also her little son, Aidan (David Dorfman), who begins drawing some rather disturbing pictures. Rachel has frightening dreams. Images from the tape appear in the real world. The clues lead her to a windswept island where some unpleasant deeds were done in the past, and from there.....well, I shouldn't reveal much more of the plot.
""The Ring"" is not very original. It has all the standard elements of a supernatural thriller. Spontaneous nosebleeds? Check. A gloomy psychiatric ward? Check. A pseudo-psychic little kid? Yup. Water leaking from nowhere? Half-glimpsed figures? Sudden, chilling revelations? Animals freaking out for no reason? Creaking floorboards? They're all there. Where ""The Ring"" succeeds is in its central mystery, its muted atmosphere, its unsettling soundtrack, and some genuinely scary moments that -- for once -- don't rely on a sudden shock. The most frightening scene comes at the end, when we learn exactly how an image on a TV screen can scare someone to death. The scene happens in broad, stark daylight, and instead of trying to startle the audience, it moves with a steady, relentless pace, getting more terrifying by the second, until......well, this is horror at its most potent, and it makes up for the film's shortcomings.
Naomi Watts has real star power, as evidenced by the arc of her movie career. (from ""Children of the Corn 5"" to an Oscar nom!) Here, she brings sympathy and desperation to her somewhat sparse character, and also proves she can scream really well. Martin Henderson is likable, even though his character is left by the wayside. David Dorfman does a nice job as the kid, even though he's an obvious rip-off of Haley Joel Osment. Brian Cox has an effective cameo as a reclusive old man, and Daveigh Chase, that sweet-voiced little girl from ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Lilo & Stitch,"" is uncredited in a crucial role that horror movie buffs will be talking about for years to come.
""The Ring"" is based strongly on a popular Japanese horror film that, according to most sources, is even better. I will see it in due time. For now, I'll just give thanks to this American film for scaring my pants off. If ever there was an excuse to switch to DVD....",1076198400,,3784,4.76103500761035
1406601,3,B000059HCH,"I hate to be a movie snob (actually no, that's a lie, I love being a movie snob :-) but, I have to say that, when taken on its own, this American remake of the classic japanese 'Ring' more than holds its own as a contemporary horror classic.
When taken in-context as a remake, however, it fails on most every count. But anyway.
To synopsise:  Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is investigating the possibility of an Urban Legend being responsible for s spate of recent teenage deaths. The Legend in question concerns a videotape which, when watched, lets you know that you have a week to live. When she herslef falls prey to the Curse she enlists the help of her old partner Noah Clay (Martin Henderson) to stop the fatal event from taking place.
And from there on in, what we're left with is a mundanely-acted but beautifully-shot picture full of gorgeous and spooky set-pieces (the lighthouse, the barn, the asylum).
Watts and Henderson are there as perfunctory eye-candy, secondary to the ingenious plot and chilling photography. Director Gore Verbinski should be proud of himself  for having done such an impressive job with monochromatic shots, the Seattle weather and minimal special effects. The overall visual impression of 'The Ring' is truly unsettling.
The acting isn't so hot, and the ridiculous, pointless sequence with the horses on the ferry goes nowhere and does nothing. There are several horrible horror-movie cliches here too, like the boy-teen at the start of the flick with near-ESP ('they're all gonna die, maaaan) that we really could have done without.
For all of that, though, 'The Ring' works well as a modern standalone horror movie, and is certainly one of the betterHollywood offerings of recent years.
On the other hand, when one watches the original 'Ringu', you'll understand what i mean. Less overstated, less effects-laden and far , far more effecting, 'Ringu' is a Classic. 'The Ring' is not. But if you've not seen either, start with the American version.

When i was watching this movie, i thought it was a little like 'The Shining', an awesome Stanley Kubrick film. (Heck, what ISN'T an awesome Stanley Kubrick film?) The ring had the mood of the shining, because it had very strange and graphic images, the plot was dark and eerie, and the photography was just like stan's movies. Lined up to see everything, and staying still for god knows how long. Also it was directed by Gore Verbinski, the man who brought us probably the most annoying and over-rated film of our time, 'Pirates of the Carribean'. I know, even though this came before POTC, it was directed by the same man, so when i watch it NOW, i just cant get that annoying pirate movie out of my mind.

1406629,4,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" focuses on a woman named Rachel ( Naomi Watts). She is a successful jouranlist that is investigating the death of her teenage niece. According to her niece's friends, it was due to a teenage urban myth. The myth states that there is a video that kills you after you watch it due to a mysterious death curse. Her investigation leads her to the tape, which of course she watches. Rachel sees about a minute worth of footage that includes a ring and a mysterious young girl with long black hair. Rachel receives a telephone call from the girl on the video saying that she will die in seven days. This freaks her out , but she still manages to remain skeptical enough to show the tape to a professional tape editor named Noah ( Martin Henderson) who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend. He also watches the tape and receives the same call. A strange set of events starts to happen that convinces the two that the curse is real. Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman)claims that he can speak to the girl in the video, and draws pictures of its contents to prove it. This pushes Noah and Rachel to believe that Aidan's life is in danger as well, and they both become determined to solve the mystery behind the tape to keep the curse from happening.
""The Ring"" is without a doubt the best horror film that I have seen in a while. With all of the ridiculous Hollywood slasher films out there, it was nice to finally see a change of pace. The thrills that the film offers are very mature and realistic. The special effects were incredible, and will make you flinch at times. The film overall is fast paced, and the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat for the majority of the film. Naomi Watts does a very good job as Rachel. The emotion that she portrays is very realistic, and she looks legitimately scared for her life. Brian Cox and Martin Henderson were also fantastic. However, the best performance was given by David Dorfman who played Rachel's son Aidan. Best performance of a young boy in a horror film since Haley Joel Osmand in "" Sixth Sense"". The film does have a few flaws though, which is why I could not give it 5 stars. While the film is well put together and rather terrifying, it can be quite confusing at times. In a movie such as this, the viewer wants to be scared and entertained. But you also want to have an understanding of why it happened. The ending is especially frustrating, because it leaves room for questioning.
""The Ring"" is an excellent horror film with very few flaws. While you may be slightly confused at the outcome of the film, you will be scared out of your mind and entertained overall. The DVD offers a never-before-seen short film created by the director that reveals secrets about the film.

You are no closer to knowing why any of these events occured at the end of the movie. I am not a dense person. I don't need to have everything spelled out for me in movies.

Ehren Kruger, whose ""Arlington Road"" screenplay was very good, does a good job in building the suspense.  Jane Alexander is always excellent, but I had to strain to see her with grey hair!  I didn't know if the part of Samara really worked for me.  Having a child be the force of evil is a bit hard to accept.  The scene on the ferry with the horse was thoroughly engrossing.  I didn't see the Japanese ""Ringu"" on which this was based or the Japanese or Korean sequels, but I did find myself having lots of goosebumps from the Ring!  BOO!",1074470400,,1539,4.602941176470588

Ironically, however, this movie did not live up to my expectations, but I still gave it a five because of how successfully the actors are able to drive the storyline forward. I really was expecting a good scare...however, it seemed more like suspense that was the fear for it. I think the whole, ""is it going to happen or not?"" type of feeling is what really kept the whole fear factor into it, and that's what is really remarkable about it. Unfortuantly, for me, I watched this movie *alone* and *at night* in a *dark room*, and when it was all over, I was afraid that the little girl would be hiding somewhere in the shadows of the room and when a friend of mine suddenly walked in on me I nearly screamed right there (which is actually a really good thing, because it shows just how much the movie can really get to you. I'm not the type of person who gets scared easily so I'm assuming this is a really good thing going for the movie)! Unlike most people I know, I really enjoyed the entire ""fear factor"" of it all and especially the disturbing images of the little girl walking out of the well...it's enough to make you want to pee in your pants. Unfortuantly, however, unlike other cheap horror movies, there really wasn't as much of a fear-like atmosphere associated with it, more of a suspenseful type. Over all, I highly recommened this movie to mature audiances and people who can sit still long enough to let the slow beginnings take you away to the breathless ending that'll leave you shocked.",1074297600,,1633,4.446666666666666

This movie is definately not for children, do not let any of your kids watch it if you don't think that they are ready. The age that I suggest would probably 15.

1406672,5,B000059HCH,"Engulfed in dark, dreary images, filled with wet and foggy visuals, and a chilling tone, director Gore Verbinski
creates one of the moodiest, and most effective thrillers to invade our heads in a long time. He creates such an intriguing and cold-like world, that you can't help but feel the chill of the thrilling events unfolding before your very eyes. The story is chillingly and well conceived by screenwriter Ehren Krueger(""Scream 3""), and really takes you for a ride. The film begins with a solid intro that at first seems like it could be the beginning of any recent teen horror films, but it quickly turns and you realize that this isn't anything like it. We learn the story in these first few minutes of a bizarre tape. A tape that is so horrible and mind blowing that it eventually causes your death. After you watch it, you get a strange call with a voice on the other end whispering ""seven days"", and in that week's time, your gone. We then meet Seattle reporter Rachel(played by the strong and breathtakingly gorgeous Naomi Watts), and her little son Aidan, wonderfully and engaginly portrayed by young David Dorfman. Asked by her sister to look into the cause of a family tragedy, Rachel discovers the shocking tape and quickly descends into a mission to find out what the tape is all about, who are the people in it, and why the people who watch it die seven days afterwards. Aiding her in her mission is her friend Noah, played by Martin Henderson. Veteran actor Brian Cox, who was the first Hannibal Lecter in 1986's ""Manhunter"", also appears in the film as a man who may or may not know some of the tape's secrets. As I have already mentioned, Verbinksi fills his film with striking visuals and images that stay with you long after the film ends. He knows how to make everything in a scene work, and play it for all it's worth. The guy knows his way around a scare and how to set the right mood and atmosphere. If this is how he does thrillers, then we can only be so lucky that he does more, as it would definitley make him a fantastic force of nature in the genre. Seattle, and the surrounding areas, is where the film takes place. I live a little ways away from the city, but the place is like a second home to me because I go there so much and have family who live there. Everyone knows about the rain Seattle gets, so seeing it as wet and depressing as it was in this movie was no real surprise. I do wonder if this really was just typical Seattle weather, or if some of the rain and wetness was created by Hollywood instead of mother nature. The actors here are all game and really give it their all. I was the most impressed with young Dorfman. I am not sure how old he is, but he was very appealing and had good screen presence. This kid was good. Watts, a vision of total beauty, tackles her role with strength and intelligence and makes it real. Cox has a rather short role, but he makes them memorable. Sometimes the small roles are like that. While it is obvious that some people don't like, or get, these types of movies(just read some of the negative reviews for that), I enjoy them because they don't just flash some kind of gore or eye candy with virtually no story or a single scene of suspense or chills like some horror films and certain thrillers. Some people don't want to think or get to involved in a story, and just want the good stuff like in slasher films. Unfortunatley, this film did get a backlash like that once it got so popular and successful, which was expected. Oh well. I am glad I wasn't swayed by those reviews and finally saw a film that I had thought would of been really good and boy was I not disappointed. I was engrossed from the beginning to end, and anyone looking for that kind of depth, intelligence, and artistry in your thrills, will no doubt not be disappointed like me. I just wished I hadn't waited so long to see the film that is definitley one of the best thrillers in years. This was a good one.",1073865600,2,3967,4.383989145183175
1406673,5,B000059HCH,"Spoilers!!
I definitely thought this was the most frightening movie I've ever seen.  It was undoubtedly the creepiest, and I'm one that's not easily frightened.  The story is based on the premise that there's an urban legend about a video tape, that after being viewed, gives the viewer only ""seven days"" to live.  This message of impending doom is eerily spoken  by a young girl's voice in a telephone call that rings immediately after the tape is watched.  It turns out that a teenage girl watched this tape, and seven days later, she dies from her heart just stopping, and the most horrible look of terror is frozen on her face.  The girl is a niece of a Seattle reporter that, at the bequest of the girl's mother (her sister), begins researching the cause of the girl's heart just stopping, which ""no doctor can explain.""  She discovers the urban legend and the tape surrounding it.  What follows is a masterpiece of thrills and scares that have been so artfully done by the cinematographers, director, musical composer, and all those involved in the creation of this movie, that I think it should be a classic.  We eventually see just how the girl died at the end of the film, and it is so frightening a scene, it will truly explain the frozen look of horror on the girl's corpse.  This scene is worth the movie alone, even if the rest of the film was more subtle and not as bone chilling, it would be worth it just for this piece of film making.
The reporter, Rachel Keller, embarks on a dark journey that would chill the bones of the toughest of people.  The cursed tape itself has mysterious, surreal images of people, places, and incoherent things, including a glowing ring.  Based on these clues, she is led to a small island town where a child named Samara mysteriously disappeared 23 years earlier, but no one knows where she truly went, nor from where she really came.  All that is known is that the girl was supposedly adopted, but we get a clue from a comment from the father and a birth certificate that this child may have been born ala ""Rosemary's Baby"" or in some other mysterious way.  All we know is that her adoptive mother went mad and committed suicide, as well as the horses she bred as her livelihood.  The town's psychiatrist, played wonderfully by a stoic Jane Alexander, infers that this child had demonic powers by stating that when Samara left, ""things got better.""  The doctor treated Samara's mother, who claimed to have strange and horrible visions that ""burned inside of her,"" and they only occurred when she was around Samara.  Rachel is on a race to get to the bottom of this because not only she, but now her young son, has accidentally viewed the tape.  Her son is a boy that Samara ""talks"" to and gives some visions.  Samara not only ""haunted"" people when she was alive, but it is found out that she died an unspeakably horrible death, and I'm surmising that out of blind hatred and anger, she continues to haunt people with horrible visions and she uses modern technology to kill them as well.
There has been much ado about videotapes and that the advent of that technology was not around when Samara was alive.  However, I gather that she continued to ""live"" even after death because it is noted that she ""never sleeps."" This fact was noted throughout much of the later half of the movie.  She never really died, except physically, and she uses the most common medium of our culture to send her deadly message.  As a child, she could only send these images in drawings and in her mind, but after death, she found a more perfect and widespread way to get her message across.  You will never want to be alone with a television again after watching this engrossing and bone chilling film.",1073865600,2,3727,4.571428571428571

It sounded like just another urban legend: a videotape filled with nightmarish images, leading to a phone call foretelling the viewer's death in exactly seven days. As a newspaper reporter, Rachel Keller (Watts) was naturally sceptical of the story, until four teenagers all met with mysterious deaths exactly one week after watching just such a tape. Allowing her investigative curiosity to get the better of her, Rachel tracks down the video, and watching now has just seven days herself to unravel the mystery of the Ring.
Review
So much money has been thrown at redeveloping an original concept into this remake that I was nearly fooled into thinking this was a good film.  It is the perfect example of how a low budget original can never EVER be beaten.  There appears, as is the case here, a constant desire by American filmmakers to spell everything out: ""Oh, and if the original wasn't very clear, that won't matter as we'll change the plot anyway!""  This isn't to say that there isn't a fragment of the original left.  In fact there are many recognisable moments that have been given the polish and sheen requirements of an easy to swallow pill.
While there may be little to choke on for those Stateside there is plenty on offer to stick in the throat, especially for purest fans of the original Japanese cult hit.  Biggest amongst these factors is the dreadfully hammy acting by Naomi Watts who never fails to give the impression that she is more concerned with getting her `good-side' profile on camera than any of that tiresome acting that can obviously be such a drag!  This is not to say that she is making a pigs ear from a perfectly silky script, as the dialogue on offer wins hands down as some of the worst committed to film in recent times.
In some twist of desperation to make `their' version of The Ring we have the inclusion of horses to the plot, making for a fairly poor variation on the defunct concept that animals sense things we humans can't.  It does however provide one flawlessly executed sequence upon a car ferry that is both original and disturbing.  With visual references to both The Shining and Rear Window, one senses that this is a filmmaker clutching to all his `good' ideas, throwing them at the original classic and using whatever sticks.
The Verdict
There is a definite visual flair to the makeup of The Ring by the ex-commercial filmmaker; but alas digital editing, jump and subliminal cuts do not make a film alone.  The original is quieter, self-contained and far more disturbing - It rules over this, no contest!",1073433600,5,2568,4.714285714285714
1406677,5,B000059HCH,"A disturbing thrilling movie to say the least; it kept me on the edge most of the movie.  From the disturbing scenes to the twisted plot it makes for a great horror movie.  Naomi Watts (whose extremely hot by the way) does a great job as the lead.  Many people thought that the plot was too confusing and did not go anywhere and at first I thought that too.  The shock value was enough for me.  But I realized I needed to watch it once more to determine the actuality of it.  I'm not going to be a spoiler here, but I suggest watching it twice if you did not understand it the first time.  That is what seperates bad movies from good movies.  The ability to have a twisted plot all come together at the end, which is what happens in The Ring.  If not watching this for the plot, watch it for the horror value.  You will not be disappointed.",1073174400,,840,4.12962962962963
1406708,3,B000059HCH,"magine that you stumbled upon an old video tape. Placing it into the VCR, a large glowing ring appears on the screen in front of you. After that graphic and disturbing images begin to flash on the television screen culminating to a final scene of a black and white forest with a well in the middle. Then the screen turns fuzzy and the tape is finished. Sound like another college independent art film right? Well, let's say that your phone rings and the voice on the other end says you have seven days before you die. Just an urban legend, right? What if it came true? This is the idea from the Japanese horror film, Ringu, which was adapted for American audiences in the thriller, The Ring. But will the adaptation work for American audiences or will the creators of the film be the only ones that are scared?
The story goes that Rachel Keller is investigating the death of a teenage girl whose cause of death was declared unknown. But she soon discovers that this story goes way beyond this teenage girl's death. Three other teenagers that were friends of hers also died on the same day at the exact same time as the teenage girl. Their deaths were also declared unknown. What is the connection between the four teenagers? About one week before their deaths, they traveled up to a remote cabin in the woods where they had stumbled upon a tape. Rachel comes upon the tape and watches it. The phone rings and the voice on the other end of the phone tells her she has seven days before she dies. She has seven days to discover the mystery of The Ring before time runs out. The Ring has one of the best stories out there. The plot goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is released around the fall season. Unfortunately the ending ruins almost all tension and mystery that is presented in the film.
The cast does a stellar job of presenting believable characters and making the fear altogether more real. Naomi Watts is great in the role of Rachel Keller, the investigative reporter who searches for the answer to the mystery of The Ring. Her character is mainly the focus of the film, though not entirely, and she does a wonderful job of making her character both a wonderful mother figure as well as a strong hero. Martin Henderson plays Rachel's ex-husband who helps her discover the mystery of The Ring. Henderson does a good job though you don't really get to see too many scenes with just him outside of a scene near the end of the film. He is usually just playing of Naomi Watts or her character's son, played by David Dorfman. David Dorfman does a great job at giving a creepy feeling to the audience but also making the audiences feel sympathetic toward his character. His character, though, came off as a Sixth Sense rip-off in parts but not too much so. Daveigh Chase, who voiced the character of Lilo in Disney's Lilo & Stitch, is exceptionally creeping and disturbing as the character of Samara Morgan. Revealing what her character does would give away too much of the movie. But rest assured, she does a fabulous job in this important role.
Overall, The Ring goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is dumped during the fall season. As good as it is, the film's ending does not do it justice because the ending is so ridiculously stupid that it ruins the effects presented earlier in the film. Not to say the rest of the film outside of the ending is not good. Gore Verbinski, whose next project is Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, does a great job of presenting the right amount of tension and excitement in parts of the film where it is needed. Unfortunately the ending ruins those effects by giving the audience an ending that makes them feel ripped off. There is no real logical way to explain the feeling without giving away most of the plot. There are also many parts of the mystery of the Ring that are left unsolved but they will reportedly be solved in either the prequel or sequel to the film which is expected to open in theaters in October 2004. If you do decided to watch The Ring, you are in for a real cinematic treat but don't have too high expectations as the ending will leave you disappointed.",1073088000,4,4163,4.500660501981506
1406709,4,B000059HCH,"I'll admit that I really can't handle horror movies too well. Your typical action-horror adventure type rarely bothers me (see ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", 2003 version), but a total psychological horror movie just scares the crap out of me.
I was intrigued the very premise of The Ring by the start, or rather, the lack of understanding of the movie that I got from the trailer. Whoever put together the trailer for this movie, he/she is a genius: presenting some odd urban legend story in grainy grey film ending with a staticky scream and then the actual shot of ""the"" ring. What the hell is THE ring? I had to find out.
First off: opening sequence. Sufficiently scary to set the tone for the rest of the movie, and ending quite violently in a flash of incoherent pictures and a young girl's horrifying demise (DVD owners: watch her face frame by frame, if you have the balls, that is).
What makes this movie is the sound: horrifyingly brilliant. If there is a soundtrack to this movie, I hope that nobody buys it, or else they will be found the next morning in the same condition as some of the corpses from The Ring.
Speaking of corpses, they are refreshingly few and far between. You only see a shot of them 3 or so times in the movie (plus one more deleted scene), but they are always put in when you don't expect it, and of course shipped together with some frightening ambient sound. The entire setting of the film is perfect: dreary Seattle, raining in every single shot of the city, monochrome backdrops from the actual nightmarish film that the main characters watch, fiery red shadows from between the branches of that ominous tree upon the hill.
Problems with the film: perhaps some plot holes. Some might argue that leaving some questions unanswered leaves the air of mystery (and sets up a sequel), but I can think of a lot better elements to be left unexplained. Either tell the entire story or leave it to the viewer's imagination, don't do a half-assed job. In then end (I'll try to keep this spoiler-free), it is discovered how to protect oneself from that scary little girl from the video, but it is never discussed why she chose videotapes as her instrument of revenge, especially when it appears that she died before the advent of home videos. Also, why is she do damn crazy in the first place? And was she the crazy one, or her mom?
All in all, a brilliant movie that with a couple minutes of work at the end could make it a classic. Also, if you watch this movie with the sound off, then it won't be scary in the least (though watching a scary movie alone in the dark with the sound off is a creepy visual in itself).

1406710,3,B000059HCH,"This was undoubtebly the scariest movie I have ever seen.  Probably because this is the first and only horror movie I've ever seen, but still.  I'm surprised I haven't had any nightmares about it yet.
I'm well aware that the plot was flawed quite a bit -- the only thing crucial to the existance of the video tape was the mom chucking her kid into the well, but they added a bunch of superfluous stuff about the horses, the suicidal husband, and what was with those flies?!?! Anyway, most of it was probably done just for the shock, and, well, it worked.
This movie got a PG-13 but I think it should have gotten an R, since me and my three friends I saw this with are all fourteen and fifteen and we were all freaked out of our wits.  No PG-13 movie has ever scared me like that before, which is why I only gave it three stars; it was so scary it got ruined for me.

1406711,3,B000059HCH,"I had high hopes for this film, since it didn't appear from the commercials and trailer to have much in the way of what I like to call ""idiot moments."" These are the moments, usually in horror films, when you can no longer suspend disbelief because of a) events that are so completely implausible that they fall clearly outside even a remote realm of possibility, no matter how willing you are to believe the sometimes far-fetched occurrences that have led up to them, or b) characters who act with complete idiocy, defying every conceivable notion of rational behavior or logic. The second one is especially maddening, like having a character or characters travel to some distant town to see someone's grave, have them get there as the sun sets, but instead of checking into a nice Motel 6 and waiting until daylight to see what they're doing, they go on to the graveyard, usually without even a flashlight. Or when they know there's a homicidal maniac in the house, they still go into the basement to look for the missing cat.
There are only a few idiot moments in this film, which makes it a pretty effective thriller by current standards, at least for as long as you're watching it. Just don't give it too much critical examination afterward. For starters, while the basic notion is pretty much implausible, it's done with enough style and is well executed enough that you can and do tend to overlook its faults. The bluish lighting, and constant rainfall of the Seattle locations are effective at setting the mood, and probably don't even need the well-done menu screens that hint at some of the images in the suspect video tape, plus give us a notion that the story involves the institutionalizing of a character, and that alone can be a pretty creepy setup.
*SPOILER-SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH* They also utilize the time-honored but way overused ""gotcha"" device in which you think the story is over and done with, only to find it's not. In this particular case, it's handled pretty effectively. Not like a supposedly-drowned Glenn Close suddenly sitting up in the bathtub, wielding a butcher knife, which I think we'll all agree is the cinematic equivalent of a 2x4 to the side of the head. In this film, it's much more subtle.

Those are the good things. Now the not-so-good:
The basic story is an OK premise for a late-night campfire tale, but not much more. How does this little girl know you've watched the video, and what celestial phone booth is she calling from? You might also ask about the manner of death that awaits you after viewing the tape, but that's a question that's never really answered. We're led to believe the victims are frightened to death, but in the end, who knows? I will say, Rick Baker's makeup effects for the girl and her victims are very effective, made all the more so by their fleeting, almost subliminal appearances on screen. You see them only in a very few, very brief glimpses. And believe me, you don't want to try to pause on them.
Other unanswered questions pop up after watching the film. The little girl lived some time in the not-too-distant past, but you get the idea it was clearly before the advent of home VCRs, so why does she exact her ""revenge"" (if that's the right word) through this particular technology? What the hell does videotape have to do with anything, other than to lend an urban legend quality to the story? And why *SPOILER-SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH* should anyone be able to ""immunize"" themselves just through the act of copying the tape? Maybe it's how she encourages people to allow her to propagate. It's certainly the way the writer set up a potential sequel. And what's the big deal with the ""gotcha"" moment in which the main character's son is horrified that his mother has ""set the little girl free?"" As effective as that moment is when you see it for the first time, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny - the girl seemed pretty well able to murder people before being ""set free,"" and now that she's ""free"" it seems she's still limiting her victims to viewers of the video, so what's the difference now? And what's the whole point of the girl's parents' story? We learn that the girl apparently caused ""bad"" things to happen, but the only example of that is her parents' horses suddenly turn into equine lemmings and run into the sea to drown. Granted, that could be pretty expensive, and it may be cause to shut her up in the stable/barn (""You'll stay here until you and the horses can get along, young lady!""), but not worth institutionalizing the girl, and then ultimately murdering her. So when all is said and done, what did we really learn from the whole trip to the girl's island home? It made no difference at all in the outcome of the story, other than setting us up for the ""gotcha."" The film spends so much time on this, though, that I have to think the storytellers expected it to do more, but failed.
I guess the long and the short of it is that it's a pretty visually effective movie (audibly effective, too - Hans Zimmer's score is ultra-creepy). It's definitely better than the usual teen screamer/Chucky/Jason/slasher movies, although the opening scenes make it look like the filmmakers are aspiring to that sub-genre. Just don't expect a lot of substance. And don't expect to remain frightened by the story after it's over and done and you've thought about it for 5 minutes before turning the lights out for the night. That's always been my touchstone for good scary movies. Can you walk away from it thinking that this could happen to you? Not this time.",1073001600,10,5548,4.655453618756371

Yes I found it a bit slow at times but the supsense was great! I could not decide if it was scary until the scene with the horse at the ferry boat. After that scene I took notice but nothing prepared me for the ""girl coming out of the TV scene"". This scene alone is worth watching the film for. The acting was great and the characters where people that I did care about.
The only discusting thing about this or any other movie are the freaks that are too quick to down rate an otherwise great movie just because of their personal biases. Sadly most of them do not even seem to know what they are talking about missing the whole point at times but nevertheles can be prety vocal about their stupid opinions. It just anoys me when some wannaby film critic is expressing an opinion about something he hardly understood in the first place! It also seems that they are prety much the same people over and over again...a bunch of idiots that seem to hate prety much everything in their lives!

The Ring was the first horror movie that i had ever had a dream of. now that shows how creepy it was! i recommend this to all horror movie lovers, u'll love this!",1072483200,,435,4.011494252873563
1406715,4,B000059HCH,"Ah good old Doug from...The Edge Of Hell. Hot there is it, it clearly has affected you.
Firstly giving a fairly decent film 1 star, did you actually watch it? The ghost interacted ""through"" the video, not ""threw"" as you put. It didn't chuck the videos around, or maybe you'd accidentally put on Mutant Ninja Turtles instead of the Ring, go check the box.
Secondly to say you didn't know that camcorders were around in the 60s show you have no clue what the film was about. The child/spirit was communicated via a video. It had put its ghostly message on the tape. Understand now? The parents hadn't stood around videotaping them killing it. Are you sure you are of the age where you can watch a film like this and comprehend what is going on on the screen?
Thirdly, you could choose not to pick the phone up. Yes that may have broken the cycle. But again you're missing a point, that is apart from a couple of people in the film, you DONT KNOW not to pick the phone up. There wasn't a message on the end of the video saying; ""if you pick the phone up you die"", which allowed them to think ""ooh I'd better not pick the phone up"".
To finish you say; ""Anyways, my rant doesn't probably make sense to those who haven't watched it."" Trust me, your rant doesnt mean squat to people who HAVE watched it, as you clearly missed some major plot points big time! Watch it again.",1072137600,,1367,4.3229571984435795

I probably should watch the movie again so I can be fair; however I remembered that it sucks pretty badly anyways.  You have 7 days from the time you pick up the phone to live!?!?!  If you don't pick up the phone after you watch the video, the mean ole ghost won't kill you. IT will just keep calling you back until you pick up, then you have 7 days.  Funny, I don't remember camcorders being around in the 60's.  Anyways, my rant doesn't probably make sense to those who haven't watched it.",1072051200,2,566,4.242990654205608
1406717,4,B000059HCH,"Think about the last time you had a real doozy of a nightmare.  You know, the kind that make you wake up drenched in sweat?  Did you analyze the plot of your nightmare while you were experiencing the utter fear?  Did it ever occur to you that what was transpiring might not be making sense?  Of course not.  Likewise, those who criticize this movie for the red herring at the end and the plot holes are barking up the wrong tree.  The Ring is all about the visual and audio effects, and what a masterful job Gore Verbinski does with them.  It isn't the plot so much as the scenes that are disturbing.  The eerie sunset by the cabin, the surreal videotape, and the terrifying image of the well slowly closing are only a few of the horrific scenes that will stick in your brain for days.  There are no sappy humanistic statements or heavy-handed political messages (the end of the film actually makes a cruel parody of this annoying trend), just pure, unadulterated FEAR.  I haven't seen this movie outside of the theater, so I cannot comment on the replay value.  However, I can tell you that even though I read the spoiler for The Ring beforehand, I still had trouble sleeping for days after I saw it.",1071792000,,1201,4.438356164383562
1406743,4,B000059HCH,"I've seen both Ringu and The Ring. (I saw Ringu first.) I can't believe it has happened, but Hollywood has managed to pull off the better of the two. Neither are great movies by any stretch (I'd give it 3 and a half stars if I knew how), but I was amazed to find that I thought the US version was more fleshed out and had a better, more interesting storyline.
This is certainly an exception to the rule. Generally, US filmakers take a fine foreign film and ""hollywoodize"" it to death, making a mockery of it. Not so here.
Genuinely creepy in parts (though I thought the final scene was pulled off with more creepy effect in the original Japanese version), I was skeptical, but I thought The Ring to be enjoyable and it darn near freaked my wife out of her wits. I love that.
In an era when most ""horror"" films are vehicles for scantily clad teenyboppers and aimed at kids, it's nice that lately there have been a few fairly effective ones (The Others, The Gift, and a bit earlier, Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes).
Wait until dark, shove a sack of popcorn in the microwave, watch it and see if you don't get a few hairs standing endwise on the back of your neck. Bravo.",1071446400,,1168,4.289592760180995
1406744,4,B000059HCH,"I'm usually wary about any movie in the horror/spooky genre which involves anything modern, especially electronic equipments like TV, telephone etc. For me, (since I am old fashioned) spook is most effective when associated with castles and witches and forests and dungeons. But this was a pleasant surprise to me. Everything is so perfect about this movie - it had me tight-gripped throughout it.
This is the remake of the Japanese classic 'Ringu' directed by Hideo Nakata (What a shame - wish I knew Japanese to see and enjoy the movie, reading English subs alone might not do the trick for me), which in turn is based on Koji Suzuki's novel by the same name.
Naomi Watts and the supporting cast are well chosen. The background score by Hans Zimmer elevates the film to a whole new level, mesmerizes you. . The lack of bright colors in the movie or rather, the choice of colors and settings which blends in with each other only adds to the eerie atmosphere. Another thing to note is that it doesn't have the usual Hollywood way of scaring people - cats jumping out of cupboards, walking zombies and ridiculous amounts of blood & gore. The strength of the whole movie lies in the suspense and the fear of the unknown it builds up.
Those who feel that there were some things which had to be explained/shown in the movie after you've finished watching it, there is an accompanying feature aptly titled 'Don't watch this' contained in the DVD which will fill in the gaps
I highly recommend this DVD; maybe renting this is the most sensible thing to do since I'm not sure how well this movie can retain its flavor in repeated viewings.",1071273600,,1632,4.63103448275862
1406745,3,B000059HCH,"Rachel (Watts), an investigative reporter, first hears of a silly urban legend at the funeral of her teenage niece, Katie.  Katie died suddenly of unknown causes while at home with her best friend, who was so freaked out by whatever happened that night that she is now in a psychiatric ward. Rachels learns from some of Katie's other friends that there's supposed to be some video tape that causes the death of anyone who watches it exactly seven days later. She is compelled to look into it further when she learns that three other teenagers all died mysteriously on the same night and at the same time as Katie.
THE RING is a good supernatural thriller and an improvement on the Japanese original, RINGU. Director Verbinski demonstrates that he knows how to raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Editing, sound and some unconventional film techniques are used to raise the creep-out factor to high level. The story is told from Rachel's point of view and she brings the appropriate skepticism about the allegedly cursed video tape. Watts plays the character with intelligence and just the right level of fear to be believable. It's not until after she has viewed the nightmarish tape that the truth of the legend becomes undeniable; Rachel is now in a race to make sense of what she has seen before her seven days are up. The only weakness of the screenplay is that when the source of the evil is revealed, it's somewhat unsatisfying because it leaves you thinking that there must be more to it than that.
Of special note is a hidden feature on the DVD menu. If you move the cursor one step below the last item, it disappears from view; press ""enter"" and the deadly video from the movie plays in it's entirety.  But don't panic when your remote no longer works...IT CAN'T BE STOPPED!",1071187200,2,1789,4.640378548895899
1406746,5,B000059HCH,"A couple of notes before my thoughts about the film:
1. There's an ongoing barrage of comments in the reviews here in Amazon with people saying that the original Japanese version (Ringu) is better or more subtle and that you ""should see that one first"" or that the American version is inferior etc. etc. etc. Sorry people, but this is totally besides the point. What matters is whether this version works or not(in my opinion it totally does) and not whow it fares in comparison.
2. Lots of reviewers talk about plotholes and unanswered questions (most of them without mentioning even where these plotholes are and why they consider them ""holes"" to begin with)...Uhm, sorry again, but maybe you didn't notice that this is a film about the paranormal???? And, as such, it is by definition ""allowed"" NOT to follow your understanding of reality??? If it did, it would then have to do with something other than the peranormal! Comprende?
Ok, onto the film then. Needless to tell more about the story, it's been written in full detail by many others.
The Ring is the first thriller-horror film in a long while that has a superb storyline, a brilliant script, and very good to stunning acting performances as well as a great directorial effort.
Even though there have been recent great films in the genre (notably The Sixth Sense and The Others) the Ring goes one step further because of its frantic pace that doesnt let up for a single minute. That's a paradox really, and simoultaneously the Ring's claim to greatness because as you see it creates the impression that it's rather slow, but, there's constantly clues added as you watch, constantly the story evolves and the film doesnt sag at all at any given point.
On top of that, there are so many ingenius ideas that work to the benefit of the whole plot (the fly that comes alive through the screen, the tape lacking a number print, and of course the fact that it's a paranormal story which finds its outlet through modern technology).
The doom-ladden atmosphere is devoid of banality, particualarly the island setting in the film and the brilliant use of the murky weather backround, but overall the director has seriously worked on intimidating the viewers without resorting to cheap ""boo!"" tactics.
Sequences like the one on the ferry with the horse that goes wild will stay on peoples' minds for a long time but the Ring is actually full of disturbing optics that you keep with you long after you've exited the movie theater. The curse-carrying tape on its own is nothing short of an art-piece, surely one that will (hopefully) inspire more films in that direction.
Extra kudos for the casting of the film: the kid is a return to the 60s faces in the genre with its almost possesed look in his eyes, as is the girl herself with her tragic grimace, but where the film could have blown it and -thankfully- didn't is with the use of the ""beautiful blonde"" but she does an admittedly very good job in her part and contribution as does everybody in the Ring in general.
Not since the Shining (and that over 2 decades ago) have i come across a thriller that kept me edged throughout as this one did. That, i think, is a heavy compliment to this flick. The Ring is not to be missed by fans of the horror-thriller scene or by viewers who like intelligent well made films no matter what the genre.
Another thing that should be pointed out, is that Ring is also an allegory on television, or rather, becomes one whether it's intended to or not. At one point the reporter is standing on her balcony having a panoramic view in other apartment buldings and what their inhabitants are doing inside and sees everywhere a switched on television set. That, along with the fact that evil chooses to use the TV set as its entrance to our world is indicative of what i mean. But, it's not merely indicative, unless you -somehow- think that TV is NOT evil.....
Instant classic.",1071014400,3,3910,4.651734104046243
1406747,5,B000059HCH,""" The Ring "" is probably the best movie to come out of 2002. I personally think it is much better then the original film, "" Ringu"".The ring has some very shocking scenes and is a very disturbing movie. Also, another plus is that the movie doesnt rely on blood and gore to scare the viewer, which is very uncommon for movies these days. I highly recommend that everyone looking for a good horror movie should rent The Ring.

So, they made The Ring, based on a popular novel by Koji Suzuki. The movie is about a mysterious video tape that has awful consequences for the watchers. Four teenagers watch the tape and they all die at exactly 10:00. Then, a reporter tries to figure out how they died. You see a freaky image one of the dead ones and then the reporter swipes the video. She watches it and has 7 days to live.

A true edge-of-the-seat movie, The Ring combines eerie cinematography, disturbing imagery and well written story telling into an arabesque masterpiece, with plenty of shocks, surprises and twists to keep you interested.

1406791,4,B000059HCH,"Gore Verbinski's The Ring, an adaptation of the Japanese film Ringu, follows Naomi Watts' character, Rachel, a journalist attempting to uncover the mystery surrounding her niece's death.  At the same time, she must save the lives of herself and her son from an impending death brought on by watching a videotape filled with bizarre images.  As she gets closer to a solution to her problem, she discovers more and more details about the death of a young girl many years ago.
 Mainly, Verbinski does a good job of pulling the viewer into the movie.  Following the mood set by the music played throughout the film, the colors in the movie are very bleak and washed-out.  The film also benefits from its lack of special effects.  Many computer-generated special effects are easily spotted, so it is refreshing to watch a movie in which the effects are kept simple.
 Also, the movie has a believable (although unfeasible) plot, which helps allow the viewer to be frightened.  Once Verbinski has people enraptured, he throws them into a situation that cold conceivably happen.  No one wants to imagine the events of this movie actually happening, thus causing fear in those who watch it.
 On the other hand, the plot tends involve suspense more than it does horror.  Aside from some of the scenes toward the end of the film, after Rachel discovers the truth, most of the film does nothing but keep the viewer watching to find out what happens next.
 Taken as a whole however, Verbinski's The Ring is a very good movie.  It is definitely worth watching, if not for its scariness, then for its suspense.  No matter the reason, fans of horror and suspense movies should watch this film.",1069372800,,1677,4.777777777777778

The plot is fresh and original and has never been done before with the exception of the original Japanese film Ringu that inspired this American version, which is far creepier and scarier than the Japanese version. However, it at first appears there are many unanswered questions at the end of the movie even after the mystery has been solved, leaving the audience to dissect and attempt to answer the questions. This is one of the things that makes it so good; it keeps you thinking about it long after it's over and eventually you end up answering your own questions. This is the scariest movie I've seen in over ten years, and I've seen almost all of the horror movies out there! If you're looking for a fresh and frightening movie watch The Ring in the dark. Alone.

1406826,3,B000059HCH,"This is an Americanization of Ringu (1998), a Japanese horror film that was well aclaimed. Usually American remakes of foreign films are a bad idea, and this is no exception.
Though many people who have seen this film find it scary, and I checked it out after several recommendations, personally, I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was not scared at all, though I watched it alone, late at night, in a house out in the woods. Perhaps I just don't scare easily though, and I admit the plot was interesting-- albeit resolved in a mundane and predictable way.
Urban Legend holds that viewers of a particular video will die seven days after seeing the film. There's a way to avoid this fate, but it comes only by stumbling onto it accidentally. The tape itself contains no clue as to its origin or auteur, and the plot revolves around the aunt of one of the tape's victims desperately trying to track down the demons responsible for this horrible thing.
This film suffers from lackluster acting; the one really good thing about it is that the killer tape itself is quite unnerving. This film moves along well, and is worth seeing, but if you're looking to be scared out of your wits, try to find a copy of the original Japanese film.",1067817600,2,1257,4.591111111111111

This little fright film houses some fine effects, gets you hooked into an almost implausible concept, and then sells out to sensationalism in the end. But the cast of actors includes Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson as contemporary lovers who have a strangely sensitive son (well played by young David Dorfman), Jane Alexander at her usual fine state as a physician, and Brian Cox in yet another superb cameo. The underlying metaphors about life and death, meaning and parenting are good. The scenery is gorgeous (Seattle and surroundings) and the tricky camera work is excellent.

1406828,5,B000059HCH,"A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible.  ""The Ring"" gives you all this and more.
This film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know that likely exists in our own home.  We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked.  The horror that finds us sounds much like an urban legend.  Watch a mysterious, bizarre videotape that causes fear in some, and others to scoff at its amateurish style and technique.  Moments after watching the videotape, the phone rings and a voice says, ""seven days.""  Seven days later the watcher of the video dies with a most horrible expression of fear on their face.
Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) learns of this urban legend when her niece dies in a most disconcerting way, and a friend who was with her becomes insane.  Rachel tries to back track recent events that happened to her niece and friend and discovers an unlabeled videotape in a remote mountain lodge.  Not yet believing the urban legend, Rachel watches the videotape.  The phone rings, and the fear begins.
Soon joining Rachel is her ex-husband Aidan (David Dorfman), and even more frighteningly, her son.  Hoping that the story isn't true, yet knowing she cannot wait for the end, Rachel begins following the clues in the video to determine whether there is a way of keeping from dying.  We discover with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together that every image in the movie has meaning.
The ending of the movie was a bit of a let-down, and yet almost as creepy as the movie itself.  As with many movies, especially horror movies, the ending can make or break a movie and the ending of this movie almost undoes all the excellence of the movie's body.
This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, and the best I've seen recently.  Elements of the movie are similar to ""Fear Dot Com,"" which was also chilling and bloodier, but not as creepy and ominous as ""The Ring.""  I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout.

I am reviewing this film almost two years after it was released and I saw it last night on cable. Nothing really gave me a chill. Watching Exorcist again after all these years most certainly does. I think the problem is, the whole film is setting up that one scene towards the end. You know, when Samara crawls out of the TV, looking not unlike Linda Blair in that other movie. It is a well shot scene and if you don't ""see it coming"", it'll scare the beejesus out of you.
But you've probably heard the hype by now. It might not make you jump out of your pants anymore. And what you're left with is a sub-standard thriller with a plot that doesn't make much sense.",1067212800,,825,4.470198675496689

Spooky images, dead horses, visions of ladders, wells, and more along with some good acting make this worth seeing. When the reporter, her ex-husband and son view the tape they only have seven days to live unless they can unravel the clues to the mystery.

 I must admit my wife and I were a bit spooked when at almost 10 PM exactly right after we watched this movie the telephone rang. When she told her son that we just watched ""The Ring"" we all had a laugh.
Although I thought this was an excellent movie, I don't see me watching it repeatedly so I gave it three stars instead of four. Like fear.com it is well worth seeing, I just would not buy it myself.

An interesting premise (based on the Japanese horror film Ringu) and haunting, provocative images ultimately fail to horrify, weakened in the editing room. The music and the look of the film are chic and edgy --  I'd buy the soundtrack and put stills on my desktop, but I never did get scared, as the impact of horrific images or revelations was often weakened by a confused structure or goofy plot devices. The ambience was a lot scarier than the plot.

Extras include a nicely done 15-minute movie that incorporates deleted scenes along with Lynch-ian b&w cuts from the video that may be proving fatal to the film's unfortunate but attractive citizens. Naomi Watts is no Cate Blanchett, but she comports herself believably in the role of an intelligent if emotionally stunted heroine. The film can be heard in English or French and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.  You can also see trailers for Ringu, 8 Mile and Catch Me If You Can.

When I saw the previews it was confusing to me, and I had to wait until it came to video, and I instantly fell in love with it! It was unique and origional and it just struck me as one of those ""soon to be classics"". There have always been mini rumors of a similar subject floating around, but this makes it fun! It wasn't as much as scary as I thought it would be but it was very suspensful and it did scare me a few times!
Ok, so there is a whispered tale of a movie that kills you 7 days after you watch and a reporters niece dies from it, and she gets ahold of the tape and watches it for herself and now her lif is on the line as she tries to figure out how to stop the tape from doing what it is set out to do and discovers that it is a nightmare of a girl with mysterious powers who was killed by her mom.
It was very good and hopefully it will become a classic like Carrie and Jaws, and maybe a sequal is in order! That would be realy interesting to see how that movie goes about, like maybe take the viewers into the world of Samara, or go into more detail about her life. That would make a good sequal!!!",1066953600,,1193,3.8934426229508197
1406877,1,B000059HCH,"Eddie Murphy used to make fun of idiot movie characters like the one Naomi Watts plays in The Ring. Not only is she dumb enough to watch a tape she has already been warned will kill her - she then plays it for her ex-boyfriend. That's being a little bit spiteful, isn't it? Then, and this is the kicker, she makes COPIES of the tape, and leaves the copies around for friends and loved ones to stumble upon. Characters like this deserve to advance straight to Death. No passing GO.  No collecting $200. They must die, and they must die painfully.
And when people in The Ring watch the deadly videotape, they watch it with their noses four inches away from the TV monitor.  Have you ever tried this?  Your head explodes after about five minutes.  Who watches TV like this?  Suffice to say that if the videotape doesn't kill all the characters, radiation poisoning surely will.  Consider it a mercy killing.
More cliches abound.  The Ring also features not, on, not two, but THREE Scary Kids. The Scary Kid cliche has dominated horror movies for the past five years, and director Gore Verbinski thinks that having multiple Scary Kids adds up to a masterpiece of terror. The end result ends up being quite the opposite.  There are some mild scares in The Ring, but it's essentially a scary movie for people who are scared by everything.  And if you can figure out why the film's ""twist"" ending is actually a twist, please let me know.  Not that I'm dying to figure it out.",1066953600,11,1468,4.526515151515151

Also the whole concept that the viewer is part of the cycle- and that you too must act to remove the curse!- is great. A guilty pleasure, but it has its charms.

1406918,4,B000059HCH,"The Ring is an amazingly scary film that makes other ""supposed to be scary movies"" look dull and boring. Every year or so theres only one scary film out there. One film, that is above and beyond all the rest and is considered the greatest film of our time. The Sixth Sense was the last one, The Ring is the new scary film on the block.
The Ring is a movie about a young newsreporter with one child and she is divorced. After her niece is killed by supposodley a video, she tracks down the mker of the video to find out why her niece died and to pull a big story for her newspaper article. What she doesn't know is that the video is controlled by a little girl who just wants people to spread te word about her life and how she was wronged. Personally I thought it was a heck of a story. The detail the amazing acting by Naomi Watts, was absolutley stunning. The one thing about the movie is that it uses a diffrent aspect of scariness, which is not blood or gore but is the story. This is something almost all scary movies have forgotten, a good story. Most scary movies just pull alot of blood and gore out and they think that the movie will be scary. The Ring uses almost no blood or gore and in my mind is the best scary movie since the sixth sense.
The one bad thing about the movie will be that it will seem confusing to the unbright people. If you pay attention though the movie will be easy to understand but you might have to see it again before you fully understand what actually happened. ONe reall good thing about the movie though is that it will play with your mind and make anyone believe that you are actually in the story. The director really tries to put you in the story. It makes you want to believe that any second from now your television set will turn on and be all staticy. And then Samara will show you the ring and WHAP your dead. The movie played with my head alot. I was so scared after seeing this movie in the theatres. In fact I didn't sleep that night or the next night after.
All in all, watch the ring, don't rent it watch it. But don't watch it alone hehehe. Most of you have already missed out because this movie was best in the theartes anyways bt hey its still scary on dvd.",1066435200,,2211,4.144186046511628

1406920,5,B000059HCH,"It's heartening that effective suspense and horror can still come out of Hollywood in this era of Scream, Scary Movie, and the remnants of moronic teen fair [Freddy vs Jason].  Not since Blair Witch and to a lesser extend, Jacob's Ladder has a movie like this creeped me out.  Taking itself completely seriously, there are no moments of humour and that contributes to the crawling terror.  In a gritty, almost monochrome colored setting, four teens die a week after watching a mysterious video tape.  The tape falls into the hands of a reporter, one of the kids' Aunt, who is trying to find out why her niece died.  She watches the tape as does her sensitive son and the boys estranged father.  She is told by the mysterious phone call that she now has 7 days to live.  The race is then on to solve the mystery of this tape, its origins and its demonic hold on the viewers.  Slowly, like an onion, the movies' layers are stripped away with hallucinogenic imagery and strange revelations.  The protagonists start their research on the NET, move to moldy public library sources, and ultimately to insane asylum records.  Eventually, the drama reaches its conclusion with additional jumps and starts all the way through.  Amazingly, this film got away with a PG-13 rating despite it's nightmarish imagery.  Very effective, brilliantly creepy film.  Recommended.",1065916800,9,1358,4.877729257641922
1406921,4,B000059HCH,"This is a tale of two mothers and two children. It begins with a bang. Cute, funny and bursting with health teen Katie tells a friend about a weird tape she watched. According to legend after viewing this hellish tape you only have 7 days to live. Katie and her friend laugh it off and then in a terrifying scene Katie dies. Enter, Naomi Watts as Katie's aunt Rachel. Rachel is smart, attractive and a lousy mother. Oh she loves her son Aidan but it's clear that she has no idea what's going on his head or what he needs. She seems to be constantly forgetting about him or dumping him with sitters, teachers, and her sister. Rachel decides to investigates her neice's death and views the tape. Later she lets Noah, her ex boyfriend and Aidan's equally lousy father to veiw it. Finally little Aidan sees the tape and Rachel must race against time to save her family.
She discovers the Morgans a once happy couple who adopted a baby girl named Samara. Like Rachel and Noah the Morgans clearly have no understanding at first, of whats going on in their child's head which turns out to be very bad for them.
There are three perfect scenes in this movie. The first is when the Morgans' doctor, played by Jane Alexander tells Rachel point blank that life is better for everybody in the whole town now that Samara is gone. The second is when Rachel discovers what's in the well and the last is when Noah finds out what happens at the end of the 7 days.
The Ring is a chilling movie and it will make you look twice at your TV set. Naomi Watts does a fine job. BUT there are some small flaws: Once Rachel is convinced about the danger of the tape why does she leave it out for her child to find? Aidan appears to be psychic. Has he always been gifted or is it Samara's doing? Aidan is supernaturally pale and has dark circles under his eyes. Rachel never seems to notice this. The ending was too weak. Rachel realizes that she's blown it, in part because she thought Samara was simply a sad child like Aidan and  decides to do a horrible thing in order to save him. Instead of implying it the audience should've been able to see her take the needed action. Otherwise this was a truly terrific film.",1065916800,,2189,4.352078239608802
1406922,4,B000059HCH,"...Still, it wasn't a bad film by any means. I might not agree with others that it was the scariest movie ever, but I thought it was skillfully-made and had some genuinely creepy moments. I really liked the overall atmosphere it created, and the effects were subtle, for the most part, not overdone. The meat of it is that I enjoyed it. It's a good scary movie, though classics like ""The Haunting"" are still scarier.
The thing I think I appreciated most about ""The Ring"" is that it wasn't trying to be a ""hip"" scary movie, like the ""Scream"" series or its many clones. It was a serious, genuine attempt at a classic horror film.
The first 5 to 10 minutes of ""The Ring"" probably represents the most genuinely scary part of the whole movie. This was a good way to go, as it certainly put me on edge for the rest of the movie.
When one starts looking at particulars, it gets even better. The main subject of the film (as is probably well-known by now) is a videotape which, once watched, somehow guarantees that the person who watched it will die in exactly seven days. The reason for this is somewhat explained by the end of the film. As a video geek, I liked some of the details thrown in about the tape itself, such as the fact (revealed fairly early) that it has no timecode track, and any copies made similarly have no time track. As a practical matter, this is pretty much an impossibility. Which is why this detail creeped me out quite a bit, and certainly lent a great deal to the mystery of the origin of the tape.
Another nice detail was the way the images from the tape are worked into the days that follow. It's not made obvious in all cases, as in through a flashback or anything, but if one is observant pretty much every disturbing image from the tape (and there are some very disturbing images) is reflected in a similar image in the events after it is viewed. One exception to this turned out to be in a deleted scene on the DVD, so it was clearly intentional, even if not quite completely carried out. Some of the parallels between ""real life"" and the tape are subtle, but they are definitely there.
One really surprising thing about the film was the music, which was understated and subtle throughout. This is not surprising in itself, but it is when you consider the composer. I thought perhaps it might have been Maurice Jarre or even Thomas Newman, with their tendency towards quiet undertones and ambient sounds. The surprise came at the end when I saw in the credits that Hans Zimmer, usually author of skilled but over-the-top scores such as ""Gladiator"" or ""Mission: Impossible 2,"" had worked on ""The Ring."" I admire Zimmer and I enjoy his scores in general, but he truly outdid himself for this film. The music is a strong counterpoint to the atmosphere of the movie, and Zimmer abandoned his usually-identifiable style and allowed the tone of the film to set the tone of his score. He had a soft touch with the music, for once, and it really added a great deal to the movie.
As for the scary stuff, there was plenty there to be found. Though I have to say, ""The Ring"" is not so much scary as it is intense. Somewhat like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""The Ring"" sets up an effective tone early on, and never really lets up. Through a steady series of surprises, it manages to keep the audience guessing about what's going to happen next. I won't give away any of the specifics, because if you haven't seen it yet then they're best seen fresh, and my description likely wouldn't do it justice anyway. But basically, as you watch the film and think that something can't happen, that what's about to happen is impossible... that's when it does. I had several ""gasp"" moments during the film, because it managed to surprise me several times. And the effects were done well enough that even such impossiblities remained convincing. The scares in ""The Ring"" are well-placed and skillfully executed. During the film I was sucked right into it, only afterwards could I start to appreciate how well it had been done.
The end result is that ""The Ring"" is a good, solid horror film, and makes no pretensions otherwise. Though not as good as some of the classics, it definitely hearkens back to the days of movies like ""The Haunting"" or ""Rosemary's Baby,"" as one of those rare horror movies that simply accomplishes what it sets out to do - scare the heck out of you - and is satisfied. Which is not to say there is not some social commentary inherent in the film, even though it takes a back seat to the story. The fact that the film's terrors reach us through our new media - television, video, and telephone - says something about the pervasiveness of these media. We trust them implicitly as methods of communication and modes of entertainment. ""The Ring"" seems to suggest that this trust is not earned, that these media can be used for evil as much as they can be used for good. That message blinking on the answering machine is an unknown quantity until you listen to it, that videotape is a mystery until you watch it, and a screen full of static may be the most frightening thing of all.",1065830400,,5102,4.493003229278794
1406941,3,B000059HCH,"This review contains spoilers.  Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie yet.
I consider myself a horror movie afficionado, so when I hear so much buzz about a new horror movie, I'm always curious to see what all the fuss is about.  Sometimes, I'm rewarded, such as when I saw ""28 Days Later.""  However, sometimes the hype just sets me up for dissapointment.  Such is the case with ""The Ring.""
I have to give Gore Verbinski credit.  He knows the meaning of ""atmosphere,"" and he can be very versatile in his tone.  His work in ""Pirates of the Carribean"" was delightfully fun, and here, he steeps the movie in a constant sense of dread.  Meanwhile, he's great with the ""BOO"" moments, the most notable being the infamous girl in the closet.  He's quite good with the whole imagery thing, using his stylish approach to make the audience remember what they saw.  The problem is that despite the general spookiness of the movie, it doesn't stick.  Yes, you remember the girl in the closet and the horse and the girl in the well, but there's no reason for you to be scared.
There is no prevailing principle to the movie.  Most great horror movies have some underlying point to them.  ""Halloween"" had the pure evil of Michael Meyers as the suburban terror.  ""The Shining"" toyed with madness and inevitability.  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" had fun with the whole dream thing, forcing the audience to try to figure out how much of the last hour and a half was real, if any of it.  If the horror movie doesn't have some kind of driving principle, then it better be so unbelievably suspenseful that you can't help but fear what is presented.  Many Hitchcock movies rely not on a central principle, but on the best suspense you'll ever see, like ""Psycho"" or ""The Birds.""  Likewise, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" set out to horrify the bajeezus out of you, and it worked.  ""The Ring"" displays neither of these traits.  It has no real point to it, and it can't be simply terrifying, because the plot doesn't make any sense.
When I bring the plot contrivances to the attention of some of my Ring loving friends, they will state that I simply didn't ""get it.""  Oh, I got it alright, it's just that the movie relies on ridiculous coincidences and actions that would never happen.  I'm not begging for realism here.  I'm begging for continuity.  For example, If you're a mother, and you've just watched a video tape that will kill you in a week, are you going to leave it sitting around for your kid to see?  No, you aren't.  It's problems like this that screw up the movie.  My one big problem is that when you really think about it, nothing happens in the entire hour and a half that you view the movie.  At the end, the kid complains that ""You weren't supposed to let her out!  Don't you see?  She never sleeps!""  Yeah, that sounds kind of creepy, but really, what's different, now that she's ""free?""  Before freedom, she killed whoever saw the tape in 7 days.  Now that she's out, she does the same thing.  So what's the problem with letting her out?  In other words, I've just spent 90 minutes watching characters make ridiculous connections in a videotape who's ""meaning"" hinges on far fetched coincidences just so that they could learn to copy the tape.  That's the only thing that is accomplished in the movie.  I've heard it stated that the girl wasn't to be let out because now she can kill at will.  I see no evidence to support this.  She kills no one who hasn't seen the tape, and Naomi Watts still has her son copy the tape for protection.  There is nothing to suggest that anything is changed.
Meanwhile, there is no sense of ""she's coming to get me!"" in this movie.  This isn't like how Michael Meyers just got up and walked away at the end of ""Halloween,"" or how there could be some kind of Norman Bates waiting for us at a motel.  No, the movie tells us how to beat the evil presented, and it's not even a difficult task.  Therefore, I do not have that subconcious fear of an actual killer tape like this, because I get a whole week to copy it, and then I'm in the green.  That's silly.
In short, the movie is great the first time through, because the jumps moments are new, and the atmosphere is fantastic.  Despite this, the plot is lame, and the movie doesn't hold together on reflection.",1065657600,4,4295,4.472329472329473

I don't really understand the negative reviews of this one. There is no gore or gratuitous bloody violence, though some is hinted at and people do die (The film rated PG for heavens sake, a real virtue: Scare me, but spare me the silly blood spattered bodies.)
The official Amazon review praises the movie fairly, but then gets miffed at its ""pretense"" and mish-mash of ideas. The plot is simple enough; it's really just ghost story threaded through a number of scenes (some weak, granted. OK, so take off one star). There are some false queues. And at least one marvelous ambiguity: the young girl's speech to the psychiatrist.  That ""pretense"" and ambiguity makes the film worth watching over, more than once. It does hang together and the pieces fit.
As for comparison to the Japanese original, we'll just be down to opinions there. If some find the American version needlessly complex, I found the Japanese far too obvious (it litterally spelled out the implications of the plot for you at the end, just in case you didn't figure it out for yourself) and paced too slowly. The video that is the central part of the plot paled in comparison. -- Maybe the West has a better developed tradtion of horror stories, or the Japanese an overdeveloped sense of restraint for the genre. So what the heck, watch them both and decide for yourself. That way you get to see two good scary movies and you can kick off some pretty interesting literary discussions as well.",1065398400,,1754,4.600638977635783
1406944,1,B000059HCH,This is an example of how Hollywood can turn a good japanese horror movie and make a real mess out of it.

1406945,2,B000059HCH,"I have always been a great fan of Japanese movies and anime, because they rely on the power of the unspoken. They still have plots that reveal in a subtle, yet chilling way. This art is lostt in Hollywood.
I saw The Ring (American version) first, and the shock-effects did nearly give me a heart-attack once or twice, but apart from that, I wasn't really impressed. The critics had been talking about intellectual horror, this movie just used gore and shocks, like any other horrormovie, hoping that they would give the audience, that's so easily satisfied these days, a good scare.
Then I saw the Japanese Ring at a shop for a bargain-prize, and decided to buy it. And I have to say, I think it was far better. It was the lack of special effects that left me chilled. Most people say that Ringu sucks, because it lacks the gore and unnecessary shock-scenes, but the lack of those things is what makes Ringu good, you morons! It's the power of the unspoken, the imagination. It's the good plot, which everybody misses, coz they're waiting for a demonic corpse (what was the use of that...?) to show up.
Ringu is intellectual horror, subtle and chilling, with a good plot, and scary because it leaves things to the imagination. The Ring is just your average Hollywood-horror, something that rots a few more braincells away, and it was totally redundant. Just to set an example of the fact that Western culture wants everything done their way, and totally screw it up in the process.
Don't rent The Ring, unless you wanna see some gory images.

1406947,5,B000059HCH,"The review by Mark Leeper explains the director of ""The Ring"", Gore Verbinski, had to have a cold yet an effective style.  This is because the only way to make a horror film horrifying is by having a certain style and way of seeing things so that you can take a scene that is not so scary and turn it into a horrific and frightening scene.  Also, Verbinski had to have the experience to turn the boring written scripts into a work of eerie tales that send chills down you spin.  Not just any director could create a film as excellent as ""The Ring"" like Gore Verbinski, you need talent and that is just one of the great qualities that Verbinski has towards horror films.
Leeper discuses that ""The Ring"" was originally a Japanese movie called ""Ringu.""  Japan has always been known for having the most bloodcurdling films.  When ""Rignu"" first came out in Japan, many people had a lot of seizures due to the frightening shots of gory faces and massacring scenes. Leeper says that the film was actually taken out of the theaters for several months after the opening of it due to everyone who watched it had a seizure.  Then the movie was looked into and discovered that it was one small seizure and so the film was brought back to the box office.
""The special effects were remarkable, says Leeper, no wonder why ""The Ring"" has had more hits in the movie house in one month that ""Ringu"" ever did.""  There have been so many shots where computer animations have taken place.  For example, when the little girl comes out of the TV screens and appears to be a translucent and fuzzy image like off of a television except she is in the room, with you.  This used special effects, like actually the part of the girl coming out of the television was actually her tearing though a large horizontal piece of green paper-like material.  And when the girl was translucent, that had to go through another process of editing.
The main cast of ""The Ring"" includes Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, and Brian Cox.  Mark Leeper feels that all of these roles were played extremely well and that all of the characters were brought out to life thanks to the cast.  Everyone's role involved so much practicing, like getting the perfect facial expressions and saying their lines with enough emotion and enthusiasm.
I feel that the rest of the crew did not get enough credit from this review.  I mean, without the cameramen and photography, this movie would not be what it is today.  And that's not all, without the best boy or the make-up crew this movie would not look as real as it does.  So you can see how every person involved in making a film is important and without them, you would not have as good quality of a film that you watch.
In conclusion, the film ""The Ring"" to me was outstanding.  It is actually overwhelming with all of the horrific scenes.  There are actually some parts that you cannot wait to be over with because they are just to frightening and haunting to look at.  The author of the review, I feel, did a good job commenting the movies acting, because I agreed with all of the remarks that Leeper had said in the review.  He says the cast did more than an excellent job and I think that is 100% accurate, I just felt that the rest of the cast needed a little more attention and credit with all of their hard work and efforts that they put into the making of the film.  Overall, ""The Ring"" is a must see movie if you are a horror movie lover and even if you aren't this film is just too good to pass up.  Mark Leeper gives ""The Ring"" a ""two thumbs up"" but I would give it more than two if I had more than two thumbs.",1063584000,,3626,4.390134529147982
1406948,5,B000059HCH,"Katie, a teenage girl, her boyfriend, and another young couple go away for a weekend in the woods of Washington State. They stay at an isolated small motel, where the cabins are supplied with VCRs and free videos. The couples select the video from Hell for viewing pleasure. What they see is pure horror. Then a telephone call warns them they will die in seven days. And they do. Katie is found, seven days later, dead, with a look of terror on her face that will give you nightmares for weeks.
Katie's Aunt Rachel, (well acted by Naomi Watts), a Seattle reporter, becomes suspicious about the cause of Katie's death when her young son, Aiden, begins drawing disturbing pictures of his cousin's burial. Even more disturbing is that the drawings were made three days prior to the fatal shock that supposedly killed the young woman. The grieving mother, Rachel's sister, asks the investigative reporter to find out who, or what, killed Katie. Rachel discovers that a video exists, previously thought to be urban legend, that actually causes the death of viewers seven days after watching it. All three of the teenagers, who saw the movie with Katie, died on the same day, at the same time.
Rachel discovers the video, and, of course, watches it. We get to watch it too. This film within a film is a surreal & ominous vision of evil. Was I scared? You bet! And then the telephone rings. Terrified, Rachel seeks help from her estranged boyfriend Noah, Aiden's father. Disbelieving, and refusing to be deterred, he insists on watching the video also. Rachel only has six more days to find some answers; Noah now has seven. Warning: ""Before you die you see the ring!"" The suspenseful countdown begins, and tension builds excruciatingly, as more horrifying clues emerge. The realm of the supernatural now becomes reality - a reality of unspeakable fear.
Director Gore Verbinski does a magnificent job of bringing Koji Suzuki's book, ""Ringu,"" vividly to the screen. He knows the source of fear is in the mind. With superb photography, camera shots of macabre images, and freeze frames, the film's ghostlike eeriness begins to work on the viewers mind, and pulse rate. The psychology of this thriller is not based on blood and gore, but on a harrowing blend of the intense storyline, visual effects, and an excellent, but bizarre musical score that encourages feelings of dread. There is so little color in the film, except for a tree's brilliant red leaves, a fiery sunset, blue red drops from a nosebleed, that it could have been shot in muted shades of black and white. These muted monotones increase the supernatural ambiance. Verbinski reveals each layer of mystery slowly, making it impossible to anticipate the horrifying conclusion, and the answer to what the ring represents.
The acting is very well done, with excellent performances by Ms. Watts, who is not a screamer, but a level-headed investigator, with a human capacity for fear; young David Dorfman, who really gives some competition to Haley Joel Osment; Brian Cox; and good cameos by Jane Alexander, a calming influence amidst the chaos, and Daveigh Chase, who makes viewers' spines tingle.
I don't scare easily, perhaps not since I last saw ""The Shining,"" but I was scared enough in this well-done movie to rate it 5 stars!",1063497600,,3283,4.885304659498208

A remake of a 1998 Japanese film, the American version is lacking everything that made the original such a talked-about hit. The two most important aspects that it never can quite achieve are subtlety and atmosphere. In the orginal, the kids all look as though they've died of fright. In the remake, they look as though they've died of fright, AND THEN TURNED INTO DECAYING, DEMONIC CORPSES!!!! All this did was to add to the special effects budget. It doesn't improve the atmosphere, and it totally ignores the idea of subtlety. You don't need decaying, gooey, demonic corpses to make a creepy, disturbing movie.

1406970,4,B000059HCH,"'The Ring' is certainly effective at setting a chilling mood, especially if you watch it with the lights out.  The problem is you have to really let go of logic and sensibilities to thoroughly enjoy it.  I would have been happier if it had ended ten minutes before the ending, because the shock you were SUPPOSED to feel at the end wasn't worth the disbelief and ""hokiness"" of the final ten minutes.  A movie that could have been somewhat intellectually satisfying became a run of the mill teenage thriller and left my intellect feeling debased and deflated.  The original Japanese film 'Ringu' wasn't any better, and I usually always prefer an original foreign piece to its American copy.
If you want to share a thriller of a movie with your kids (my boys are 9 and 12), this is the one to see.  No gratuitous sex scenes, no extraordinary amount of bad language, and the horror of it is much more psychological than visually graphic, except for one suicide scene which flashes quite quickly.  I won't let my kids see Jason or Freddy yet, but 'The Ring' scared the crap out of them without any permanent damage to their young psyches.  They actually placed a book of children's bible stories (I wouldn't let them use the family Bible) in front of their bedroom door that night - - but it was ""giggly-scared"", not sheer terror.  Of course, you have to know your own children well - your nine year old may not be able to handle it.  Our kids have grown up with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Army of Darkness', and other such scariness.  We try to protect our kids from graphic sexual depictions and realistic violent images.  To us, slaying a demon is not the same as watching a violent murder.
If you are really looking for a good, quality chiller of a story, with fewer plot holes, I would suggest 'Stir of Echoes', 'What Lies Beneath', or 'The Others' instead of 'The Ring'.",1062028800,,1874,4.564179104477612
1406971,1,B000059HCH,"Typical of Hollywood to remake an original foreign cult movie to appeal to the ignorant narrow-minded masses.  Sure, they can spruce it up with updated special effects, more shock tactics and disturbing visuals, young attractive actors and new creepy dialogue - but you're watching an entirely different film altogether.  You're watching the Americans greedily try to claim something their own and make it look better.  The Hollywood plastic factory ruins yet another unique concept and form of cinematography.
The best thing about 'Ringu' the original was that they didn't rely on updated special effects or creating an overlly modern look.  It was realistic and gripping because it was so raw and simplistic.  They focused moreso on the element of drama and realism.  The narrative and visual sequences were full of symbolism and artistic integrity.
Another thing that made this movie (Ringu, the original) so appealing was the fact it was Japanese and not sensationalised consumerist American slop.  It delivered the message that not all good horror films are American, they don't all need to be traditional and excessively gory and it emphasized the fact that fear is universal by showing how it is depicted in a different culture.  I think a lot of Westerners detach themselves from the rest of the world and it seems unimportant and irrelevant that people in other cultures experience the same horrors.  Perhaps they thought that the only way Westerners could relate to the horror in the film is if they brought it closer to home and portrayed it in the typcial American style.

1406972,4,B000059HCH,"A Film by Gore Verbinski
The Ring is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror classic Ringu.  Since it is both a remake and a horror movie, I didn't think that this was something that I would enjoy.  I rented the movie anyway.  One thing to note about this movie is that it is more of a suspense thriller than horror.  It was creepy, but not that scary.  It was also quite good.
The premise of the movie is that there is a video tape going around and if you watch it, you will die in 7 days.  It is passed off as an urban legend and as a joke, but a teenaged girl died mysteriously.  The mother asks her friend Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a reporter, to investigate.  Rachel learns that the girl's boyfriend died at the exact same time, but in an unrelated manner.  She also learns that a couple of other kids, all friends, died at the exact same time on the same day and that they had all supposedly watched this video together.  Rachel travels up to the cabin they stayed at and finds a tape that they might have watched.  She watches the tape and it is creepy and weird and she can't look away until the tape ends.  Rachel is scared and the phone rings.  When she answers it she hears a voice say, ""Seven days.""
Now freaked out and thinking that she is going to die in seven days, Rachel frantically investigates the origins of this tape trying to find out the truth and also how this came about.  I had expected a kind of blood and guts movie where massive amounts of people are dropping dead after watching a videotape.  Instead, this is a fairly intelligent and well done thriller regarding an investigation into a mysterious videotape.  The video is creepy, and I was surprised by how good this movie was.  It is one of the better films that I have seen in the genre.",1061251200,,1771,4.27027027027027

This is the stupidest, dumbest, most random and pointless movie that I HAVE EVER SEEN! There are several unneeded scenes in which the movie is able to add a little bit of gore to it (the flash of Katie in the closest, the horse falling off the boat, and the RIDICULOUS way in which Samara's father kills himself) but honestly! They could have made the movie just as good if not better if they had left out their attempts at some blood. There are also several moments in which you believe the movie is over (I saw this in theaters and people, including myself and the people I went with, actually stood up to leave on 2 different occasions. Then when the movie finally does end you will sit in your seat waiting for the REAL ending because you're hoping and praying that it didn't actually end on such an empty note. It's as if they were going for an ending like The Twilight Zone had, but somewhere along filming they lost their script and the result was a wanna be cliffhanger. The ONLY redeeming quality of this film was the way that it was filmed and the music. The constant watery look definatly adds to the feeling of it and the music will give you chills. The acting was actually not that bad but unfortunatly the plot was missing and thus all the actors hard work was in vain. All in all, I don't recomend this film if you're looking for a thriller that will leave you thinking or even able to discuss it at the end but if you just want to see some spectcularly creepy filming then i GUESS you can watch this, other than that, run away quickly when someone suggests it.",1060646400,2,1676,4.3238095238095235

Would our ties to this unreal world take our eyes off the ball to the extent that our ememies abroad might creep up on us unawares? In this film the enemy is more abstract.

1407004,5,B000059HCH,"If what scares you is an axe-wielding psychopath who spends two of your hours chasing around some stupid teenage girl who perpetually runs in the wrong direction, this movie isn't for you. But if you like a good, freaky mystery...if you've got a brain and can put two and two together...if eerie people and scenery and symbols and events give you a thrill, ""The Ring"" is guaranteed to scare you. Alot. Of course, even if you DON'T meet those criteria, it'll still scare you anyway. Maybe more. It'll haunt you afterward. And you'll wait seven days for your TV to turn on by itself and see the horrifying images on that video...
OK, well, I won't give the story away. But it is VERY SCARY. I watched this movie in the dark, and it was the creepiest thing. It is not a childrens' film, not least of all because they probably won't understand it. You have to pay close attention and maybe watch it more than once to get it all. Another point: I too was bothered by the horse scene. I'm sure that the Humane Society monitored the set and saw to it that no animal was harmed, as they do with almsot all movies, especially big ones like this; and I'm sure that camera tricks and computers were employed to help make it look as bad as it seemed. I have pretty much convinced myself that the horse in the movie was not actually hurt just to film the shot.
""The Ring"" is the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen alot. ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Omen,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""I know what you did last summer""....they're all good, but this one is different. It's a psychological thriller and scary movie and mystery in one. There are symbols and clues and some VERY freaky moments. The scariest? I dare you not to be afraid when Samara climbs out of the well and comes through Noah's TV and gets him. Come on. It's sheer terror. This movie was very well-made and it's a great story. Right from the beginning you've got scariness. The kid, Aidan, is scary. Everything in the tape is scary. The way it ends (as though YOU'RE next because YOU watched the tape) is scary. And clever.
I did enjoy ""The Ring"" immensely. When people told me they literally could not sleep for days after seeing it, THEY WERE NOT KIDDING. Wait'll you find out just what ""the ring"" is. It's a great movie. But in case I haven't stressed it enough, it's verrrry scary. I suggest you watch it with company and a pet, a pillow, a blanket...some popcorn maybe...and turn out the lights...",1058227200,,2446,4.44988864142539

1407027,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring was an interesting mix of urban legend, psychological thriller, and rip-offs of other horror/suspense movies.  Because I watch a lot of them, I had to pick up this DVD.  I did not have the chance to see it in theatres, so my first viewing was just a week ago while lying in bed one evening.  There are images that have still stuck with me.  I loved it!
Director Gore Verbinski did an excellent job with a cast that we would not usually recognize...this helps because they have not been fixed as other characters in our minds.  The horror of ""The Ring"" is the suspense.  After watching a video, people are told they have seven days to live through an anonymous phone call.  When people start dying, those who have watched the video since, begin to take notice.  Intrigued by solving the mystery of where the video came from, a doomed investigative reporter follows the clues to the video's source.  This is where an interesting turn takes place that took me from sadness and empathy to fear as I honestly had chills.
The DVD menu is themed with the video from the film.  Bonus features have titles like ""Look Here"" and ""Don't Watch This"".  After viewing the film, you may have a hard time deciding to view segments with such warnings, but they were well worth it.  One is a trailer for the original film, ""Ringu"", which ""The Ring"" was based on.  The other is a short film of what appear to be deleted scenes.  Many times it is easy to see why deleted scenes were taken out in the first place (they are boring and add little to the story).  On the other hand, these scenes invite the audience in on some interesting information that changes what you thought you knew about the characters...very interesting.
Why 5 Stars?:
For no other reason than this movie gave me chills that have stuck with me for a week would I have to give it this rating.  Furthermore, young Daveigh Chase won an MTV Movie Award for being the scariest villain and you will see why.  The thrill of joining the characters as they try to solve the mystery of ""The Ring"" should be a highlight in the DVD library of fans of ghost stories...that is, those of us who like to get a good scare every now and then.",1057881600,,2184,4.4335839598997495

I rented this movie along with some others (Mothman Prophecies, What Lies Beneath) ,and I found I liked it the best. Not only is the director able to evoke an eerie atmosphere, but he manages to throw in the ""random thrills"" at unexpected moments, like when Rachel (Naomi Watts) is suddenly grabbed by Samara in the well. Naomi Watts performance is superb, she really makes the scenes come alive and become realistic for the viewers, enhancing the already blood curling although over the top plot. As each of the days pass by, the suspension is at an all high on the seventh day when Samara is finally given a proper burial.
  Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, but it wasn't as what I expected it to be from all my friends accounts of it.
First of all, the video tape was not that disturbing, except for the fingernail being torn of from the finger, and everything else was a bit pretentious. Everything on the tape comes for real, which seems scary, but isn't, for you already know what's going to happen. And the final unexpected ending (which I will not say!) wasn't at all a tribute to the whole scary driving effect, it wasn't exactly a total fiasco, but it insults your intelect.
  Overall I do give it a 4, but it goes up a notch more when you watch it at night. OOOOOOOOOOOHHH, scary!!!!",1057881600,,1462,4.464419475655431

The film is good to look at and features a few genuine ""spooky"" scenes, but it doesn't rise above the standard ""things-that-go-bump-in-the-night"" premise.
Perhaps, the hype got to me and I expected too much. It was just too derivative.
The one saving grace is the appearance of Jane Alexander, one of stage and screen's must underused talents, in a small but significant part.
As an animal lover, I wasn't too fond of the horse on the ferry scene, either. I looked for the end credit disclaimer, the one about ""no animal was harmed..."" although I knew that what I had seen on screen was a camera trick.
It was just a little too realistically filmed, and I needed reassurance that the animal was unharmed.",1057363200,4,917,4.597560975609756
1407030,5,B000059HCH,"For some time now I've heard several great reports about this particular film and despite the fact that I don't often watch horror flicks, the overly positive reviews and touting up of this film overweighed my reticence.  The first thing I noticed was the PG-13 rating just before the film starts which immediately tells you that this isn't going to be a blood, guts and gore fest!  The second thing one will notice throughout the film is that it's not so much a horror flick as it is a pleasantly surprising, thrilling and suspenseful suspense/thriller.
Of surprise as well are the relative newcomers who star in this film, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson.  Needless to say, I'm sure their stock has gone up considerably due to the success of this film.  Director Gore Verbinski deserves copious accolades for bringing this great film to the silver screen and the home theater!  From the camera angles to the shocking soundtrack, this film hits on all cylinders.
The premise:
The basic premise is pretty simple; some teenagers get away for the weekend at a remote cabin and find that the television reception is pretty poor but they do find a VHS tape in their room.  They've seemingly heard of this tape before but ignore the warnings/rumors about it, those warnings being that whenever someone watches it, they receive a phone call immediately afterwards telling them they have seven days and then exactly seven days later they turn up dead by various but almost inexplicable means.
One of those teenagers that ends up dead at the beginning of the movie has an aunt who also happens to be a reporter, in comes the ""oh so"" gorgeous Naomi Watts as Aunt Rachel.  Rachel's sister entreats her into finding out what happened to her daughter and she takes on the task!  Rachel soon discovers where the children were and of course, she watches the tape and receives the phone call.  She now has seven days to figure out the mystery to save herself...
What follows from there is as stated above, one of the best and most intriguing suspense/thrillers of 2002!  I highly recommend this movie as I'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised as well!  {ssintrepid}
Special Features:
This one is kind of short on the special features but who cares, because this is all about the film.
Don't Watch This - Director Gore Verbinski created this short film exclusively for the video release that reveals more secrets about ""The Ring.""

1407031,5,B000059HCH,This was easily one of the scariest movies ever made! I was so scared during this. Watch it alone in the dark.,1057276800,,110,4.045454545454546
1407032,2,B000059HCH,"I was so scared watching this film alone in my apartment. If I had a phone I would have been so frightened if it rang during the film. During the DVD when they played the actual short clip on the videotape in which you die if you watch it. Well, for a safety precaution, I shut my eyes  and yelled ""La dee Da"" over and over for almost a third of it so I wouldn't have technically have watched it.
I think the naming of the film was lackluster. Why would they name the film after the ""ring"" of a phone? That just doesn't make too much sense. The ringing of a phone just wasn't that important to the whole film. They're were so many other fitting titles much better than the Ring. Some possibilities should have been, ""Can You See the Lighthouse?"" or ""The Videotape""
The film was also very very long. I like to be scared but not for this long. I would have reccommended that when the caller called the person and said you have 7 days. They should have cut it down to you have three days. Some films drag on and on. Three days would have been more than enough. I was having lunch the other day with my Brother, Tommy and we were discussing, ""What would have happened if someone watched the film  and daylight savings time happened that week where you set the clocks back a hour. Would that person have an extra hour?"" Tommy suggested the caller should say you have 168 hours (24 hours times 7 days)just to cover themselves.",1057104000,,1420,4.275092936802974

Some people have said this movie was not scary at all, but I totally disagree.  The dead people that are throughout the film are very frightening indeed; some people in the theater actually screamed out loud when they saw those scenes.  This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and I think it should have gotten an ""R"" rating rather than ""PG-13"".  I even had to tell my mom explicitly not to allow my 16-year-old niece to see it under any circumstances.

1407035,4,B000059HCH,"It seems that a lot of people--my sister included--didn't understand either this movie or its ending very well.  The only explanation that I can come up with for this is that the movie doesn't explicitly make the connections for you and just presents you with the questions and evidence for you to draw conclusions from.
For instance with the ending.  If you ask yourself why she was sent to that dark place in the first place, the answer as to why things happened the way they did and *in what order* becomes a natural consequence and makes perfect sense (hint: home, attic, mental instiution, well--in that order).
I considered this movie horridly frightening, but blood and guts are not what make it so--it has virtually none of either.  All of the elements--though confusing when you first encountered them--came together into a gestalt as you put the pieces into the questions it presented and just made the movie more frightening as you went on.  Things that appeared completely random were anything but and their place, while rarely explicitly shown, was certainly presented.",1056067200,,1082,4.961325966850829
1407036,4,B000059HCH,"Ah... the American audience that we are. Everything has to make sense. Everything has to be linier. EVERYTHING has to wrap itself up in a little box. First, I would classify this as a Mystery / Suspense, not BOO! Horror. Having a certain time limit before you die may be similar to Fear dot Com but Ringu predates 4 years and I always say in any given time frame at least 2 movies come out that are ""similar."" Armageddon / Deep Impact for instance. Even these stupid junk e-mails I still recieve had that mentality before 1998 (whether it be death or bad luck, or body parts falling off if it isn't forwarded to at least a million people.)
And thats what this movie is. This is a take on an urban legend, changed to a television as the venue, with a stab at that nasty invasive TV we have as a misinformant and a babysitter. Samara, and the mystery behind her, makes the movie, but without the prominent psychic overtones of the original it comes off as incoherent. In the original what tied everything to the cabin was that only there did the phone ring. In our version I'd expect Samara to call my cell phone if I didn't have a land line handy. And why does ""Before you die you see the ring"" not make any sense? The american writer mis-interpreted the meaning of the title ""Ring"" which was intended to mean ""to call up"" and co-incides with the other two books Rasen (Spiral) and Loop.
This is an excellent movie on it's own, and I won't get into the schematics of the story as one other has already done so. The movie, like most Americanized films, has it's flaws, yet had been put together with a great deal of care, and while good on it's own it differs greatly from it's Japanese parent. Ah yes... Japan where stories don't have to be fully explained because their creators want you to think for yourself (take the PS Game series Silent Hill which I believe borrows ideals from the Ringu series.)
Yes it is a great movie... but what we have here is a collage. In Japan, Ring is a phenomena encompassing 3.5 movies, a Korean Remake, 2 TV Movies, and a television series; the 3.5 moving two different directions (the official book version in one Ring 2 and the adaptation version in the other Ring 2,) the Korean in another direction, and the TV versions? 3 entirely different directions in themselves. Want to overload your brain? Try the third book ""Loop"" and you'll wind up with an entirely different story when it's all over (and don't forget the Sega Dreamcast Game based on those books.)
Unfortunately our writers had to have watched the entire series and take parts from here, parts from there, erase the girls history and start over, change whom killed her, move all psychic refrences to mere hints, and completely take out the actual virus/smalpox/DNA tie in (though there is the vaguest hint in the curse tape.) And more unfortunately key points are missed when this isn't taken into account. Want to know whats up with Becca in the mental hospital? Watch Ringu 2... Um Ringu 2 Version 2 that is. Sadly one must know the entire pre-existing story (make that stories) to truly appreciate it. Kind of reminds me of the ""How many can we squeeze into one"" mentality of Queen of the Qamned.
I for one am happy to see a mystry/suspense/thriller/horror that moves away from the breast-obsessed filmography 5 teens stalked by killer ""A"" who's known what you did last valentine's the 13th and died in all 6 movies but still catches you even though he was walking but you ran top speed.

1407037,4,B000059HCH,"Ok, I've been reading the reviews of this movie and I have to say YOU MUST NOT HAVE PAYED ANY ATTENTION!  First of all, the movie WAS NOT based on Fear Dot Com or some classical piece.  It was based on a Japanese film called Ringu which I must say was pretty freaky.  Fear Dot Com took their idea from this.
Anyways, my opinion of this movie, it scared the MESS out of me!  I love horror flicks and I'm not easily scared of movies.  Most horror movies leave me laughing in the aisle.  Jason X for example but that is another review.  Back to the review at hand, when I first started watching the girl walking through the house all I thought, hmm sounds like your atypical horror movie.  But as soon as I saw her dead in the closet I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.  The movie is one of those psychological thrillers.  The plot is this.  Theres a video tape floating around and if you watch it you will die in seven days.  A reporter, her son, and her ex all watch the movie and then try to find out how to stop the seven day prophecy from coming true, all the while suffering from hallucinations and other physical hangups that come with watching the movie. The movie is pretty good until the end.  The ending [was bad]!  All this scare and then nothing. Its like after the climax the movie is pretty much over, no decreasing action or real resolution.
So my suggestion is buy it or don't buy it.  But certainly don't go by my review.  See it for yourself and figure out if u like it or not!",1055808000,,1500,4.174216027874564

The only horror film that I remember being REALLY scared by was 'The Blair Witch Project', and I do enjoy films such as the 'Scream', where there's something more than just the scares to the movie (such as humor), and tries to give its viewers room for thought about the nature of horror films.
Unfortunately, 'The Ring' was just your average, run of the mill, regular, predictable scares that frankly, didn't scare me. The reason behind the run of the mill, predictable, etc. deaths (did anyone ever wonder why almost ALL horror films deal with killings?) was a complicated, supernatural and illogical, just like all other silly horror films. Even the twist at the end was pathetic... Unfortunately, the plot was as standard and boring as they make them, and the story itself was unplausible and just too much (for me, at least) to believe. Add to that the boring characters were unlikeable, hard to sympathize with, and one dimensional - and you get a cinematic exeprience which is a horror in itself.

comedy to me than frightening. One is tempted in many
horror films to make one liner jokes  and to belittle the
movie after the viewing. There is no such temptation with
this film. As always, the most frightening films are those
which play upon what you imagine, especially when combined with
that element of the psyche which is DISTURBED. Many of the reviewers which have low rated this film, or called it boring
because ""nothing happens"" apparently have subsisted on hack and
slash movies. This one utilizes a far deeper, more elemental
fear: madness, children, rejection leading to revenge, and supernatural pre and post grave powers. The lighting, angles,
relief that it's over and all is well (Oh no it isn't) techniques which areeffective in some films and laughable in others are quite spooky here. If you want to see buckets of blood, look elsewhere.

The Ring is very disturbing, and everything is enhaced by the use of great filmogrophy.  Some of the images are really frightening.  While watching it I really got into it, and thought it was going to find some great way to finesh itself and explain everything.  However, once the movie ended and I looked back on it, I realized something:  The Ring had no plot.  How anything happened, why it was connected to the video tape, none of it was explained.  The movie was very complex, and you had to think to get what was going on, but despite this it still maneged to not truely make sence.
Anyway, in the end, it was a frightning foray into horror, and was able to make me remain somewhat scared and  keep my lights on and  long after my TV had been turned off.  And that is a sign of a good horror movie. So if you're in the mood to be frightened, go out and rent this flick. Just be prepared to never want to watch TV again.
A little side note:  The Ring is actually based on a Japanese movie which in turn is based on a novel.  The Japanese movie is now available here in the U.S. under the tiltle of Ringu, so anyone who just can't get enough of the Ring

If Hollywood is going to make a movie with the same title as one of the best classical pieces out there, they could have the decency to use the same plot.  No, instead, they do some stupid horror movie.

So I wanted to see why.  What was so evil about this tape.  How did these viewers die, and why?  Everything about this movie is good except the ending and the answer to the above questions.  First of all, the Ring is in no way like the Sixth Sense.  At least that movie was consistent, it was a ghost story.
The Ring for the whole movie (except the ending) leads us to believing there is a logical reason why people are dying.  Naomi Watts inspects the tape with high-tech equimpment and follows leads.  I kept hoping she would find the evil killer genius behind it all, but instead the movie reduces itself to some ""Freddie Kreuger"" type ending.

Use this as criteria for judging what degree of moron the film panders to: the very first clue, the one setting off the chain of events, is Naomi Watts' discovery of a Next-Day Photo business card in her dead niece's school binder; no writing, dates, etc, just some hearts drawn on.  She goes and picks up the photos.  How would she have known when it was from, that the photos were still there? Even if she didn't know, what is so initially compelling about a business card?  In the excised version of this scene, which they have at the end of the VHS version, she finds a photo CLAIM TICKET taped to the girl's wall calendar, on the day that the pictures were taken. This would have neatly established that the photos had not been picked up, and that they had been taken very recently. There's no way that a writer/director following the line of thought/concept characterizing this film (how Americans are mad to breed then plop their results in front of televisions; media pernicious, spread like virus...) would have contrived such ludicrous plot details (it's not the only one; a later scene has Watts circling the only person in a photograph and murmuring her name aloud, I guess as a concession to those who do their viewing glassy-eyed and glazed in drool). Somewhere along the line, Steven Spielberg or whoever pulled the director aside and said, ""Uhh, no one's going to know what's going on."" After I was done being insulted, I became very sad. The movie has fabulous cinematography, subtle sound and imagery, and a neat conceptual parallel to the book it's based on, but the end result likens to Scream and I think someone should be severely punished for it.",1054684800,,1889,4.683734939759036
1407079,3,B000059HCH,"I can't quite remember if it was on a movie channel or on DVD, but back a few years ago, I watched The Ring for the first time. There were a few scenes that were there that I did not see upon the second time viewing the film.

After viewing the cutscenes on the DVD, or more aptly titled ""don't watch this"" segment, I realized that among those were a few of the scenes that I had seen previously before a few years back; only they were part of the natural flow of the film, not a cutscene or not paved over.

The ending was also different as well. I did not remember a happy or calm ending like what I just watched 10 minutes ago. *spoiler* The version I saw back in 2002 ended with Naomi Watts walking up to the chair, turning it around, and seeing the twisted expression of horror on the guy's face. It ended abruptly and went right to the credits. Note that this was not RINGU, as I've seen that as well. Totally different movie.

Just thought it was interesting that there are two different films of ""The Ring"" out there, both with different endings and certain scenes removed while others were added.

If you can get past the ridiculous plot, this is actually a well constructed, suspenseful movie. The movie is built around the mystery of a disturbing video tape that leads to your death in 7 days after watching it. Namoi Watts, who is a fine actress decides to uncover the mystery after her neice mysteriously dies from watching the tape. Watts's character naively tracks down the tape and watches it. The phone rings and a voice says ""seven days"". She becomes wary and after some hallucinations she begins to beleive in the tap. She then must save herself by trying to unsolve the mystery.

Along the way she digs up an eery story of a little unloved girl, and finds love of her own.  The backstory was very well done, being neither hamfistedly overdone, nor so strained that it was impossible to catch up on the details.
The mood of this movie was appropriately dark, with a mounting tension and dread played out very well.  The colors in this movie seemed to have been bled out, a feature I only noticed at first when I saw her nose bleeding. It was only then that I recognized why everything looked.. wrong.

1407124,1,B000059HCH,"in gore verbinski's the ring, based on a hugely popular japanese film, there exists a videotape whose content causes its audience to die within a week of viewing. the premise is similar to another movie released this year, feardotcom, whose content caused many filmgoers to engage in behavior also originating in japan: seppuku.
naomi watts plays a journalist whose niece dies unexpectedly in the opening sequence. the girl's mother asks her sister to investigate the death. she chats with the girl's high school friends, putting her skills as a reporter to the test (""hi, i smoked pot once"" is enough to create a bond: ""dude, she's cool. we should, like, tell her stuff""). the path leads her to a lodge, whose owner remarks that the group in question, like many other kids, skipped out on the bill (why isn't it his policy to require visitors to pay before they stay? why have the scriptwriters decided to needlessly tarnish our image of the recently deceased?). she borrows the videotape, the only one in the lending library without a case, and views it in the same cabin her niece stayed.
her six-year-old son (david dorfman), apparently a graduate from the h. j. osment school of acting, is fiercely independent -- making his own lunches, drawing alone often -- in order to deal with his mother's chronic tardiness due to the late hours she keeps at the newspaper. in one scene her boss tells her she is fired, only to have her reply that she isn't; that settles the argument. a consequence of her not being present is that her son finds and watches the tape.
she enlists her friend (the boy's father, though no one seems to have ever told little david) to help uncover the mystery behind the tape, which they copy so that they can study the images, which include horses washed up on a beach, a tree whose leaves appear sanguine in the sunlight, and a woman brushing her hair.
the movie does have a few moments that are genuinely unnerving. a spooked horse smashes windshields on a ferry. a dead girl pulls herself through a television screen to incapacitate her next victim. however, rather than adequately describing the videotape and its contents, by denouement the film has merely succeeded in stacking plot twists of varying incomprehensibility on top of one another.",1053907200,12,2276,4.793893129770993

 The first half of the film is a bit confusing, but by the end almost everything starts to fall into place. Mind you this isn't one of those movies where the entire plot is spoonfed to you, but its fairly easy to understand MOST of what's going on. I felt that it was less of a ghost story and more of a 'mystery' type thing. Either way, the whole premise of a videotape that can kill you is creepy in itself. The movie's ending is a bit bizarre and frightening at the same time; I've yet to comprehend some of what was going on.
Anyways, the DVD isn't that spectacular; the only extra features are a short-film(which fills up some of the plot-holes and shows some new scenes and what seems to be an alternate ending) and a trailer for Ringu and one for Catch Me If You Can. The DVD also has the French audio track and some captions and such. If you like your movies with creepy suspense and some thought, then you should see The Ring. But be cautious; you wouldn't want to get an unexpected visit from a certain little girl..",1053475200,2,1247,4.306382978723405
1407128,1,B000059HCH,"The Ring is a top notch horror flick, right up to the end. It definitely keeps you guessing the entire way, it's spaced well, and it does have a rather original plot when compared to the other horror fare out there. A reporter starts investigating after a neice and company die after watching a tape. Her boyfriend and son gradually get dragged in, multiplying the sympathy level (frankly I couldn't get myself to care much for the reporter character). Eventually, she tracks down the source of the videotape. What really drags you along is whether she will discover enough in time, or if it will even matter.
You get several takes of the 'killer' videotape, which is very bizarre, and fits nicely once you understand where it all comes from. It would, frankly, take too long to explain it here. Suffice to say, it seems more psychotic and disjointed than the imagery placed in ""The Natural Born Killers""
If horror movies scare you, this one will scare the bejesis out of you. That being said, the reason I rated it so low is that the ending, reminiscent of Arlington Road for its' cynicism, ruined it for me. I won't spoil it for you, but what the reporter does at the end of the movie makes me ill. Great movie, ruined by a vicious ending.",1053302400,,1241,4.544642857142857
1407129,1,B000059HCH,"This movie has a very shaky story premise to start with: if you watch the video tape, some nasty monster will crawl out of the screen and scare you to death in seven days. Ummmm, think about that for a moment. Being in the internet age and considering this is a contemporary story, what's stopping any of the characters in the movie, especially the main character who's a news reporter from uploading the video on the internet and let half of the world see it? Are you telling me this tape is gonna wipe out half of the world's population who watched it? Maybe we need to send in the military coz it certainly would qualify as a weapon of mass destruction.
Ok, the acting is pretty good and the direction, cinematography is not too bad. I can give you my suspension of disbelief and it actually keeps me somewhat entertained anticipating what might happen to the beautiful Naomi Watts. Unfortunately the end of this movie is so out of whack it really ruins the whole experience. If the movie ends where they discover the little girl's body in the well putting the girl's spirit to rest and starts rolling credits, it would have been a decent film despite the weak story premise. But no, they have to remind the audience how weak the premise is and trash the whole picture by putting in this stupid, generic twist ending: the little girl's spirit is evil and it is a mistake for Naomi to save her. Now after the spirit kills Naomi's lover, Naomi has to protect their son by having him make a copy of the video tape like she did to avoid getting killed, because that's what the spirit wants: to make herself seen by more people.
Hey, don't just make another copy. Broadcast the ...tape on the net and the spirit would really be happy killing billions of people. I bet that's what they are cooking up at the movie studio right now for the sequel.",1053302400,6,1843,4.455621301775148

The Ring is definitely not your typical horror story.  It doesn't have scenes that make you jump out of your skin, nor does it have gory, bloody imagery.  Rather, you are at the edge of your seat wondering how this story will continue to unfold as the mytery deepens.  The director makes excellent use of the natural surroundings to provide a dark, creepy backdrop enfolding this story. Plus the music score adds a level of discordant creepy ambience.  The viewer is totally drawn in to discovering what the source of evil is and how the characters will manage to escape (or can they?).
Totally engrossing, unnerving, horrying ...and satisfying to watch!  The last scene blew me away.
PS.. I also saw Ringu and kudos to the Japanese version for such an original story.  But the Ring beats Ringu hands down for creep factor.",1053302400,,1089,4.5487179487179485
1407141,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring is a superb hybrid of a thriller/horror film that will keep you enthralled and, in true great horror film fashion, will make your flesh crawl.  And that's the point and something that the VAST majority of horror films fail to accomplish.  The cinematography reminded me of ""Seven"" and, as someone else mentioned, ""the Cell.""  Imbued with a seemingly simplistic idea about an urban legend about a tape that kills its viewers within 7 days, this taut film is propelled by superb direction and genuinely creepy shots interspersed throughout the film that will startle and scare.
The film's lead character is played quite well by Naomi Watts (who continues sharpening her acting chops following her excellent turn in ""Mulholland Drive"") from the start.  Her race against time is compelling and not without many surprises.  The supporting cast is exceptional as well with another great supporting performance from Brian Cox as a troubled father.  The make-up work is also quite excellent as I still can't get those dead people out of my head!  The horror aspect of the film makes this more of an Exorcist-type film, rather than the twists of ""The Others.""  The audience is not allowed to be de-sensitized to some slasher style ghost or anything and that appears to be the secret to horror for today's jaded audiences.  Less is literally more.  And it works brilliantly!  I would highly recommend watching this film during the day if you want to get a good night's sleep, but if you want a true scare, then do what I did and watch it alone and at night.

1407142,5,B000059HCH,"As much as I love the horror genre, I will admit that only rarely has such a film aspired to let alone attained the artistic plateau upon which The Ring proudly sits.  The movie is an artistic masterpiece, a film whose amazing textures and tones invite multiple viewings and a never-ending search for further insight into its darkly beautiful truth.  I find myself examining everything my eyes run across, trying to analyze the pattern of raindrops on a car windshield, watching in curious awe the rushed setting of the sun behind a magnificent tree, wondering if door number 601 means something, etc.  While the original state of advanced creepiness and awe-struck surprise fades to some degree after the first viewing, The Ring somehow manages to completely captivate me every time I watch it.  The plot is, naturally, a little on the weird side, but it certainly seems straightforward enough for me to wonder why some viewers claim they did not understand the movie.  I don't think anyone can truly pick out and digest all of the subtle implications of the film on the first viewing, but there's really nothing incomprehensible about The Ring at all.
I won't even try to describe the plot; any iota of preconceived notions or revealed plot points robs the potential viewer of the complete experience this movie takes pride in delivering.  One issue of concern with a lot of horror movies is of course the ending, and the anticipation one feels sitting down to watch The Ring for the first time can very well preprogram the brain to expect a let-down of some type.  I can assure you that the final plot twists and ultimate ending will delight you and renew your faith in truly original movies of this genre.  I should add the fact that the ending does much to counterbalance the riveting early moments of the film.  In my opinion, the opening scene here is the creepiest, most powerful beginning to a horror movie I have ever seen, and I assure you that this is a very bold statement on my part.  The cast, I must say, is wonderful.  Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson help sell the mysterious truth about ""the tape"" to any viewers reluctant to suspend their disbelief, but it is the children who make this movie a truly creepy good time.  David Dorfman makes young Aidan a dark and complex little boy who, one might think just by watching him, could very well be Antichrist material.  The mysterious child Samara is the pivotal character in this film, the conduit for all of the horror and psychological manifestations of dread and fear, and Daveigh Chase is uncannily remarkable in the role.
While the movie is a horror masterpiece that sells itself, I am a little disappointed at the paucity of extras included with the DVD.  With so many artistic nuances complementing a wildly unpredictable plot, I would dearly love to have the director or an actor or two offer their thoughts on the process in the form of a commentary.  The ""never-before-seen short film"" of roughly 15 minutes is good, but I can't say that it really delivered many new revelations about The Ring.  There was one additional piece of information I picked up that works on a psychological level, but overall it is certainly not a Rosetta Stone with which to translate the secrets of the film.  Consisting of several deleted scenes mixed within a cauldron of images from the film itself, it was little more than interesting to me.  It is nice to have a trailer for the original Japanese film Ringu thrown in, but this trailer is the equivalent of a TV commercial and not an extended theatrical trailer.  In the end, of course, the extras are just extras; it is the motion picture itself that matters, and The Ring not only delivers the goods, it knocks down your door, grabs you by the throat, and shoves them right down your gullet.",1053129600,2,3804,4.701807228915663
1407143,5,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is an American adaptation of the 1998 Japanese horror film called ""Ringu."" The plot is hideously simple: a videotape floating around kills anyone who watches it at the end of seven days. We know this because after the poor viewer gets to the end of the film, the phone ""rings"" and a voice whispers ""seven days."" A week later, someone finds the body of the viewer dead as a doornail with horribly swollen facial features. During the final week of life, people who watched the tape suffer from unpleasant hallucinations and nosebleeds. If this sounds like an urban legend to you, you're right on the money. But when this urban legend appears in the form of a movie like ""The Ring,"" it blows hooks hanging off doors or ghostly hitchhikers right out of the water. This movie is full of creepy shocks, claustrophobic atmosphere, and hidden symbols and clues. It even has Naomi Watts, the blond babe from Lynch's schizophrenic ""Mulholland Drive"" as the main character.
The beginning of the film pulls no punches. Katie and her friend Rebecca are discussing the effects of electromagnetic waves on the human brain when an offhand comment about a videotape that kills comes to the fore. Katie looks fearful as she confesses to her friend that, indeed, she saw the tape in a cabin with some friends. After some playful hijinks, we discover that Katie really did see the tape as we catch a quick glimpse of her final moments of life. This tragedy brings into the story her enigmatic cousin Aidan and his mother, a reporter for a Seattle newspaper named Rachel. At the request of Katie's mother, Rachel begins to investigate the videotape, a task that assumes dire proportions after Rachel watches the tape and realizes she might die in a week's time. What follows is a race against impending doom, a doom that assumes additional dimensions when Rachel's acquaintance Noah and her son Aidan watch the video.
Research into the tape unearths one strange turn after another. A woman who appears in the tape turns out to be one Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who went insane after adopting a little girl named Samara. Moreover, the images Rachel saw on the tape continue to turn up during her investigations. As the mystery slowly unravels, many questions arise. Who is Samara and what is her connection with this dreadful videotape? Is this frightening little girl a ghost who chooses to haunt through the processes of media instead of rattling chains in a house? How can misery transfer itself to an inanimate object? And my personal query, did anyone else find Aidan as eerie as Samara?
One thing is certain: repeated viewings of this film are most helpful. One time through won't do the trick with this movie. You must be patient and pay attention because the answers are do not come easy. I think too many people expected an undemanding slasher film instead of this suspenseful, downbeat exercise in cerebral terror. I for one welcome these fresh attempts to deepen the horror genre. Gory exploitation films and teenage stalker movies certainly have a place (consider how Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers are now a permanent part of our pop culture), but for those of us who want something deeper and darker to strike us insensate, ""The Ring"" delivers the goods. The scene where Noah experiences what really happens when one's seven day waiting period expires will stay with me for a long time, and it was all done without a knife, axe, machete, power tool, or whatever else horror film murderers are using to dispatch their victims with these days. I haven't been this unsettled by a little girl since the twins in Kubrick's ""The Shining."" ""The Ring"" hits a home run on several levels.
The DVD version, with wonderful sound and a great picture enhanced the horrific aspects of the film. Included on the version I watched was a trailer for the original ""Ringu"" and deleted scenes that provide additional information about the mysteries of the film, including a chilling alternate ending. Regrettably, there were no commentaries or behind the scenes clips for the movie, although one imagines that a ""Special Edition"" will soon appear containing such things (for extra dollars, of course). If the Japanese public's response to ""Ringu"" is any indication, expect a sequel to ""The Ring"" in our country within a year or two. Sequels often do serious damage to the original picture, but if more films take us deeper into the mysterious realm that is Samara, I welcome them with open arms.",1053043200,152,4481,4.8359375

The plot requires you to think to sort out all the details. Rachel is a reporter for the Seattle Post, and the director does a good job of putting you into her place. You get lots of information that just isn't important, but you have to sort it away from what is - just like a reporter. The confusion adds to the eerieness of the plot and setting. Speaking of which, they couldn't have chosen a better place to film. I had no idea Seattle could be so creepy!

Transfer wise: WARNING!!! - this is a movie in which all of the principle characters and their surroundings register in varying degrees of tonal green.  But, as that is the way the film makers intended you to see this film, what can I say?  The green levels are nicely balanced.  Fine detail is generally good, even during the darkest scenes (and this film has a lot of them), black levels are rich and deep and contrast levels (between green and more green) are good. There is some pixelization, particularly during the flashback sequences, that is excessive.  Also, film grain is present throughout and is, at times, distracting.  Audio - well balanced, nothing amazing but lacking in any shortcomings that should be mentioned herein.
BOTTOM LINE: If you like this sort of thing, the DVD offers an ample quality that is sure to please. If you think this is a great horror movie, my condolences.",1052524800,2,1535,4.722846441947565
1407172,5,B000059HCH,"Here on video is ""The Ring"", one of the most terrifying films of the last 20 years.  Forget the kitsch of ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Scream"".  This one has the cold horror of your worst nightmares.  It's an instant classic, a movie like ""Seven"" or ""The Blair Witch Project"" that redefines your expectations of the what the horror film genre can deliver.  It begins with the constant chill of dread and intensifies until it explodes into one of the most unforgettable endings ever.
  This is one of those rare movies that has you dreading the next scene, not because it's bad, but because you know when it comes it will pack a wallop.  When I saw this in a movie theater with a packed house, I didn't think I had seen audience hysterics like that since ""Carrie.""  Naomi Watts, fresh from her triumph in ""Mullholland Dr."",  gives a plucky and touching performance in the lead as the young reporter and mother who finds herself up against unimaginable evil.
  The video release only enhances the impact of ""The Ring"".  You can use your slow-motion and freeze-frame buttons to clarify some of the horrific images that go by so quickly.  For example, I think I discovered the identity of a girl shown in a quick cut to a mental hopital; an identity that may be a terrible prophecy of what happens *after* the movies ends.  On the ""Limited Edition"" of the video there is a 15-minute, artfully edited short film that is made up of outtakes from ""The Ring"".  Lindsay Frost has a big scene; it's too bad it was cut.  Another victim of the ""haunted video"" is shown.  And there's what appears to be an alternate ending, set in a video store, that has monstrous implications.  If you are a fan of genuinely scary movies, you can't afford to miss this.",1052438400,5,1734,4.538709677419355

The film is well acted and beautifully shot and has some genuine scares, despite the some holes in the story. But by the end of the film, your'e too scared to care about the inconsistencies. Very similar to ""The Cell"" in certain aspects. Take a shaky premise and hire a decent cinematographer and a great editor and you a better than average genre piece. Be wary of taking at the film for more than it is and just let it entertain you. Nothing really special on the DVD. Shows deleted scenes and a trailer for ""RINGU,"" the Japanese film that inpired the ""The Ring.""

Regardless of what you think about horror films, this one is a unique experience.  Instead of relying on grotesque creatures or maniacal killers, this movie went back to the roots of horror:  psychological terror.  It starts out slow and starts building an unbelievably tense pace as it races towards the end.  The best thing is that it does not rely on a ton of special effects to get the job done, a rarity these days.  Movie buffs should get a lot out of some of the interesting scenes in here.  Nothing special, but nothing to sneeze at either.
It is nice to see that Watts recovered from her dismal role in Children of the Corn IV.  Hopefully this movie is a jump start for career.
Basically, this is a great movie for anyone who wants to be scared.  Whether or not you buy it should be based on a preliminary viewing.  If you like it, get it.  For those of you who have not seen it yet, SEE IT!!!!  You won't be disappointed.",1052092800,,1120,4.280952380952381
1407176,5,B000059HCH,"Have you ever heard the story about the tape that kills you when you watch it? Well, if you haven't, you should listen and listen well because it works like a survival guide in this static empire we call entertainment. Dismissed as an urban legend by some, it showcases the fact that there is actually something that preys upon people that are caught unaware and this thing, it isn't like you or me. It doesn't care who it harms or if you meant to watch it at all, only wanting you to figure out what the tale it tells is before you see the ring. If you don't, well. We begin with a tale of four teenagers spending time in a cabin located amidst postcard scenery, all of them partying and enjoying themselves while taking time to be in the arms of the people they love. Everything seems to be perfect, too, until something happens. While trying to record a football game, they picked up something strange, a broadcast that they never wanted to witness, and then they made the innocent mistake of watching it while trying to see the match-up they taped. Soon afterward, they receive a phone call that tells them that they would die in seven days. Thinking that this was something of a joke (or at least dismissing it as such), the four teenagers began seeing things with their inner eyes, dreaming lexicons of vividly nightmarish dreams, and on the seventh night, well. And thus it beings.
As far as the mingling dread and cinematic visions goes, The Ring was an impressively crafted blanket of both moods and ideas, forging a tale around a haunting legend about what happens when evil truly has a tale to tell. From indentions of the atmospheric to mooding set by the candlelight of dread, the story itself propels onward and makes its viewers pay attention, demanding that the audience keeps its eyes forward at all times in order to understand what is taking place. It isn't a table set with little creatures eerily yelling ""boo"" every now and again either, but is instead a work that manifests itself as one piece, coming together to leave a chilling impression in the spine of those who watch it. The horror within it, although buried, sometimes peeks out and says that it is watching its watchers, making use of cryptic visualizations that are haunting morbid and that demand that you remember them. And remember them you will, because the presentation of the idea is nothing if not scarring. This is furthered by a cast that is actually believable, a feat in and of itself in modern movies, and by the fact that this is not a movie with a happy ending. In fact, the ending of this, well, it leaves enough question marks open to let the viewer think thoughts of doom each and every time they reflect back, knowing that the beastly could always come and say hello. (And the short piece included is like this as well, making it all the more frightening when the exclamation point is added to that retelling).
If you are a fan of the genre and you like your plots thought out, then this is a movie that I would highly recommend. Statements proclaiming that this movie didn't make sense are absurd and without merit, and people that say that it didn't set an atmosphere obviously need to upgrade their senses a notch or two. Perhaps, with a fair number of distractions, the movie could be ruined and perhaps, with the wrong setting, the effect wouldn't be as well noted. Still, turning off the lights and sitting in the darkness, letting the little chills walking the stairwell of your back, works well with this piece because it has the ability to be haunting. Many tales, they are scary, but few tales can actually evoke a feeling of dread. To me, movies like The Ring are what tuning in are all about.",1052092800,7,3705,4.572932330827068
1407177,3,B000059HCH,"After watching the re-make of the original Japanese ""Ringu"" I have to admit that it falls short!
It is of course the highly polished and stylistic approach to the original but it fails to capture the emotions. The audio-visual experience is very satisfying indeed, but the story changes and the overall acting are very inferior to the original. Although the movie stays true to the 70% of the first film it then strays from it, as it should, but the lack of imagination makes it a smaller and more ""Hollywood"" movie.
The original film ""Ringu"" is very cheap in comparison, with very low quality picture and Japanese dialogs, which makes hard to watch, but it is truly inspired. The story is very well thought and almost everything is explained, while the story in the ring is cut and paste with a few, unexplained changes like the mother - father switch in the final scene (from the original) and the location of the well. Where does it explain in the American version Why the girl ended up there? The portrayal of the girl Santako-Sanara in the original is far creepier and far less seen. A note to the Hollywood screenwriters sometimes less is better (take Alien the first movie for example). At last my final disagreement with the remake is the Jason-Freddie look of the villain while in the original there was a true sadness about her.
I am sure that people that saw it first must have enjoyed it, but I wish to inform them that it really could have been great if only the minds in Hollywood had any imagination left in them!!",1052092800,,1529,4.583941605839416

The story of someone dying after viewing a videotape is good... but when the main character begins to learn why this tape kills people the film becomes a mass of confusioning sub - plots and a terrible anti- climax for something that started off interesting...

1407180,3,B000059HCH,"The story of 'The Ring' is simple and it is just as like other horror movies but it gives a different style of horror. The whole atmosphere of the movie in itself is very dark. One female newspaper reporter found nameless videotape in the cabin and she watched it . But it showed only weird things and after watching it, she got a call. The scary voice on the phone said 'You are going to die in a week' In one week she needs to find what is going on and also the solution and way to live too. She asked help to her ex-husband, who has knowledge about video and photos. He needed to watch the same tape and also got a call. Few days later, they know what happened little by little and just one day before female newspaper reporter's day to die, they got to know true story?
The last scene that the girl came out from the television was the scariest to me, yet it doesn't make a sense in a way.  After watching it, the whispering voice saying 'You are going to die in a week' kept hounding me. Despite some plot holes, I would have to say that this movie worth the time and rental fees.

1407191,5,B000059HCH,"As a horror movie, The Ring, which is remake of a popular Japanese film of the same name, is very easy on the eyes. The photography, dark and brooding, is outstanding. And the female talent - Amber Tamblyn, who turns green (and who eats it early), and Naomi Watts, who doesn't do either - are both delicious to watch.
Amber and three of her buddies (including her boyfriend) catch a video - and they all die within a week, exactly. Naomi watches it too, as do her ex-husband and her son; so she's driven to solve the mystery before she croaks; which she does (solve it, that is), detective style, in bits.
The acting in the film is first rate; and Naomi is entertaining to follow with her beautiful green eyes and overly luscious red lips (even though she doesn't kiss another girl, as she did most recently in Mulholland Drive).
Without giving everything away, Naomi ties up all of the story's loose ends. (Each person sees a ring before they die, which is but a piece.) The movie, however, doesn't end when you think it does; but it finishes later - before you think it should. (Does that make sense?)
Watching this feature reminded me of a Dean Koontz novel. The story is fairly linear, with just a touch of technology and science (medicine) mixed in for fright. The visuals are only mildly gruesome; and all of the fear is generated by acting and pacing, which makes the movie ultimately very satisfying.
I'm not usually into horror flicks, but I enjoyed this film immensely. Naomi Watts puts on a sterling performance. Don't miss it!",1051920000,,1538,4.596363636363637

1407193,4,B000059HCH,"Several horror films of the past thirty years or so have become ""classic"" expressly due to their chilling atmosphere, unusual photography, and enigmatic endings:  ""Carnival of Souls,"" ""The Haunting"", ""The Others"", to name a few.  Along comes this flashy terrorfest called ""The Ring.""  Admittedly, it has some truly disturbing and unsettling moments, including the strange death of a horse on the ferry boat; the emergence of a little girl from a well and through the t.v., to name only two.  Naomi Watts is very good as the heroine, looking somewhat like a younger version of both Nicole Kidman and the divine Lara Parker.  Martin Henderson has a boyish charm, yet soft machismo, that makes his Noah expand beyond the cardboard character he's given to play.  In the version we bought, ten minutes of some kind of ""footage"" are tapped on the end, without explaining exactly what this footage is or what it's doing on the tape.  Actually, some of the unused footage helps clarify the plot a little better.  The footage suggests that the video tape ends up in a video rental store; woe the viewer who watches this one.  And that's where this movie's strength truly lies---the horrifying video is so surreal and frightening, it's like watching your own worse nightmare come to life.
The cinematography, atmospheric music by Hans Zimmer, and a small cameo by the brilliant Jane Alexander, also help elevate this movie.  Watts is good to watch, there are plenty of scares; just wish I truly knew what the heck happened!

1407194,5,B000059HCH,"With the story and directing filled with sharp twists and turns, The Ring turns out to be one of the best thrillers in the recent years.  Naomi Watts stars as a reporter whose niece dies mysteriously.  The niece's mother asks Rachel Keller (Watts) to track down the cause.  The director, Gore Verbinski, makes the story move with such impressive camera movements and makes a visually stunning film.
While tracking the cause of her niece's death, Rachel Keller hears of the whispered tale of a frightening videotape that causes all that watch it to die seven days later.  She finds that the four kids, including her niece, that watched it, died seven days later.  Stumbling upon the tape in a mountain lodge, Rachel watches it herself and gets a call saying, ""Seven Days . . ."".  With the days narrowing done, Rachel must find the origin of the tape and save herself.  When her child watches the video tape also, the race is on to save their lives.  The film will keep you totally engrossed in every passing second so that your eyes never blink or leave the screen.
The DVD isn't that great though.  The picture is superb and as clear as glass.  The sound is also top-notch.  Special Features, this is where the DVD loses power.  The special features are: A never-before-seen short film created by the director with the deleted scenes, trailers for Ringu, 8 Mile, and Catch Me If You Can, and the actual RING videotape seen throughout the film.  You think such a major box office hit would have more features to please its numerous fans. The DVD is still a thing to get if you really enjoyed this film or even if you thought it was just good.

1407195,1,B000059HCH,"Dear God,
  Please deliber me from ever seeing movies like ""The Rink"" again. Ok, pretend it's 1982. John Carpenter's mood masterpiece ""The Thing"" is released upon the movie going public. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror films ever released. What do the critics have to say? Well, they HATED it. The end leaves you without closure as to whether or not the Thing survived and may or may not take over the planet. What does this have to do with The Ring?...Well, the critics resounding LOVE for this [item], mainly.
  Not only does The Ring not have a definate ending, but aside from the first ten minutes of the film, it has no definate ANYTHING. The plot is a complete mess. It starts off sounding like a pretty great movie. There's a cursed tape, kills you within a week of watching it, and the first ten minutes takes this fantastic premise and uses it to scare the heck out of the viewer. I kept expecting to see more scenes like that, but instead the movie jumps back and forth between completely nonsensical and unrelated plots. There's something about an infertile mother and diseased horses...I mean, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I know that this movie never explains ANY of these stupid little subplots which fill the following hour and twenty and minutes.
  What do the critics have to say about this film? This film which has about twelve different plotlines and never explains what one has to do with the other? ""The best movie since The Exorcist!!!""? Jeezus...Maybe they mean Exorcist II: The Heretic, but The Exorcist I watched was a landmark movie which was actually scary and at the same time, made perfect sense. It also presented a great question about human psychology throughout the ages and about what we MIGHT be capable of with that 90% of our brains which we never use, or what evils we might be susceptible to. ""The Ring"" presents you with nothing. No questions except just what exactly the HELL you just paid seven dollars to sit through.
  I'm a horror fan. I've sat through some strange stuff over the years, and not all of it made perfect sense. Videodrome, for example. Not EVERYTHING in Videodrome makes perfect sense, but in it, you're seeing things through the eyes of a man who is slowly losing his grip on reality, and a reality which is slowly losing it's grip on the TV addicted human race. So even though not everything is explained, it doesn't need to be. It takes place in a world gone mad. Or Phantasm...You're seeing things in sort of a dream-state. The Ring gives the viewer no such luxuries to its driveling incoherent storyline. The simple fact is, whoever adapted it from ""Ringu"" for American audiences was just an idiot. He clearly believes that audiences won't know the difference between a plot that has a narrative, sequential story, and a movie like the Ring that has no plot. Apparently he was right. This is one of the highest grossing horror films, which saddens me.",1051488000,2,2953,4.654510556621881
1407196,1,B000059HCH,"Unfortunately, the Sixth Sense wasn't really scary either. (but don't get me wrong, I liked the 6th sense)
The movie starts you off with two stupid girls doing their stupid late night girly things, when they conveniently let the audience know all about the urban legend of a video tape that kills you 7 days after you watch it. Coincidentally, one of the girls watched it, and it's been 7 days. She gets the axe.
A nice enough start, but it's all down hill from here folks. What follows is a story so bland and void of any sort of coherence or exposition that it made me want to scratch my eyes out. I will say that it had some nice visual effects and the ""video"" itself was actually kind of neat. However, that's not nearly enough to tickle my fancy.
HOWEVER, I myself am a fan of thinking movies, and this movie definately made me think. It made me think, ""What in the hell inspired me to pay $ and waste two hours of my evening to watch this piece of ....""

1407198,3,B000059HCH,"Watching ""The Ring"" is like watching a light version of ""Ringu"" 1 and 2. At that's exactly what it is. A mix of the plots of the two 1st ""Ringu"" movies (per example the screen that the 1st victim's friend uses to avoid seeing the TV is from ""Ringu 2""). And when I say light, I mean with less plot, more action/special effects sequences and, well, simply less frightening.
They also added things that weren't there in the first place at the expense of other things. The father having the power ESP might sound stupid to some, but it explains the son's visions. And why did they have to add an entire scene with a horse gone mad? Why did the horse go mad anyway? It's not like Samara intended to [do away with] Rachel with that horse. There were several days left! Ok, so Samara hated horses, still, why? Well, that was 5 minutes wasted for no good reason.
And there's too much music. In the original ""Ringu"" movie, there was less music, which added to the eerie atmosphere. And as others have said before, the movie is too self-explainatory. Who in their right mind would sit at home after that her ex-husband/ex-boyfriend was killed by a mysterious girl through a TV-screen and ask herself ""What did I do that you didn't? *SEES VIDEOTAPE* I copied it... and showed it to you..."". Sounds like a kid's movie.
And the ending was a bit disappointing. ""So what will happen to the people that we show it to? Will they die too?"".
It's a good enough movie, though. It does scare you, but not quite as much as the ""Ringu"" series. I especially recommend ""Ringu 0"". Unlike ""Scream 3"", ""Ringu 0"" put both of its predecessers to shame!
Let's hope that ""The Ring 2"" (a standalone that won't have anything to do with the original ""Ringu"" series) will be better.",1051315200,,1746,4.476489028213166
1407199,4,B000059HCH,"When I first saw ""The Ring"" at the theater, it caught me off-guard. To say that this fine and extremely stylish horror film frightened me would be an understatement. This film worked beneath my skin, striking multiple chords and leaving me genuinely creeped out. Film director Gore Verbinski has done an excellent job in remaking the 1998 Japanese horror classic ""Ringu."" He was in a no-win situation, as most Hollywood directors are when trying to remake superior European/foreign films. ""Ringu"" is superior, only because it came first. But ""The Ring"" is as frightening a ghost story as you are most likely to see.
And that is really all that ""The Ring"" is at heart - a ghost story. Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" another stylish ghost story enjoyed by American masses, ""The Ring"" creates an ominous, supernatural sense of doom. The dead walk among us in these two films. But the eventual difference is that in ""The Ring,"" the ghost does not particularly like the living. And there is no easy way out for the stalked protagonists.
The plot, now familiar, details a mysterious videotape. When watched by unlucky viewers, they die within seven days. After the death of four teenagers, who viewed the tape following a weekend trip to a remote cabin, a Seattle newspaper reporter (the lovely Naomi Watts) investigates the case. Yes, she watches the tape, and realizes her days are numbered. The intensity level is cranked up when her son accidently views the tape himself, and now the mystery must be solved within the dreaded time.
""The Ring"" succeeds because of the eerie sense of mood it creates. The images on the videotape itself are gloomy, to say the least. The Pacific Northwest locale of Seattle and the surrounding countryside (used so well in early ""X-Files"" episodes) also establishes a foreboding atmosphere. In ""The Ring,"" the skies are always overcast, the forests are forbiddingly dark and the rain continually falls. And of course, there's the ghost. I will not describe this creepy apparition, suffice to say when it does make an appearance, I found myself wanting to close my eyes and flee. It is a nightmare come to life, much like the videotape itself.
To me, whispers are far more terrifying than screams. In ""The Ring,"" it is whispers emanating from dark places you will remember most.",1051315200,3,2298,4.894871794871795

The film's strength lies on its mood and atmosphere, with the plot, acting and dialogue all good enough to keep the film afloat without detracting from its creepy fun. With a predominately blue/green tint all throughout the film and plenty of fog, rain and gloom, ""The Ring"" takes place in an unsettling world. The disturbing images in the videotape alone are enough for nightmare fodder, and perfectly put the viewer's nerve on edge for the film.
Sure the plot may have some holes in it, it's not the films strong point, but it's enough to carry us through to the end without questioning it too much (How often can you say that about any horror film). There's a taste of ""The Blair Witch Project"" here, taking more of it's creepy mood rather then its fleeting novelty, and barely any gore to speak of (though plenty of frightening visuals).
Anyone tired of the same-old horror retread will find much to be fearful of in ""The Ring."" And plenty of nightmares that night.",1051056000,,1205,4.609302325581395

1407219,4,B000059HCH,"Basically, what I noticed about people who dislike this movie was that they were looking for something to make them mess themselves in their chairs.  The Ring WILL do this to some people, particularly if it's late and you're alone.
However, that's expecting something that the story isn't really trying to be; if you actually WATCH the film instead of waiting to jump out of your seat, you can pay attention to the story, the characters, and so forth.
The 'cursed video' isn't meant to be frightening (although if Nine Inch Nails tend to creep you out, it'll probably make your skin crawl), it's designed to be BAIT.  If the [people] who were so eager to criticize it for not being the best horror flick since The Exorcist, or to rant about how it's trendy new-school non-conventional [***] would have gone to the trouble of watching the film for the film itself and not the bowel loosening effects, they would have found a very interesting story.
What it lacks is resolution; it ends on a cliffhanger and certain things which could have been explained more clearly are not; they are left just vague enough to keep the viewer interested.
Also, this movie is a remake based on the first of three movies based on I believe a trilogy of novels which also spawned a TV miniseries and a manga (comic book). Holding ""The Ring"" to the same canon as ""Ringu"", the original version, is just a bit unfair. ""The Ring"" was made to stand alone. ""Ringu"" was the first of a series.  Cut it some slack.
My advice is to watch the Ring and keep your brain focused on the movie and not the fear factor.  Then, go searching for information on the original story.  You won't be disappointed.
As for the DVD, the Easter Egg makes it worth it, and fun as a practical joke for your friends.  Also, the deleted scenes (some of which I wish had been left in) are very satisfying.

Very good film for a date, or any group of people who can keep quiet for the length of the film (its kinda long), or at least don't mind rewinding regularly. Oh, and don't see it alone!

That's original and brilliant!!  Sadly to say, the idea is the best thing about the movie, besides the few, and mindblowing, special effects and overall darkness of the movie.
It's really hard to review this movie because everything averages out to be average.  The plotline and storytelling of the troubled girl was not effective.  The director needed to spearhead the reasons early on and failed to do so, which left you wandering and confused as the movie developed.  The special effect of the girl crawling out of the TV was pretty cool though...I was freakin' a bit.  Also the pictures of the people who had seen the video tape were very concerning with their faces contorted and misshaped...that was about the most terrifying thing for me.
It's worth renting, but don't expect to be blown away...",1050796800,,968,4.789156626506024
1407222,4,B000059HCH,"The original Japanese film didn't make much sense either... but it must be remembered that the entire franchise stems from four novels (elaborating upon the events of the first film) that have in turn been adapted for comics, TV and feature films in their native country.  The audience for which the original version was intended would already have known the basic story (a very interesting idea) and the attraction lay in seeing a new interpetation, just as one might go to see a new performance of Hamlet; everyone single person in the theatre knows what happens in the play - they are there to see what the latest director has to say about it.  Apologies, I have veered wildly from the point, but Alex and others mentioned the original and their comments require a response.  Another explanation for the apparent vagueness of the original might be that the Eastern peoples do not share the Western requirement for closure.  Loose ends are more interesting when they dangle and sometimes...things...just...happen...for...no...apparent...reason.  This can be frustrating for European and American audiences but, once understood, actually provides a very refreshing viewing experience.
Anyway, onto the American version.  Forget words like 'scary' and 'horror'... sure, there are some 'jumpy bits' and a few moments that will unnerve the viewer - but the true terror of The Ring exists in the dilemma it poses.  I shall not spoil it for anyone who has not already seen the film but those who have should know what I'm talking about.
One of the reviews suggested that in trying to explain the plot anomalies of the original the American version merely confuses the linearity even more.  To some extent this is true, some of the weird events that occur in the film are included purely for effect* - which is a shame - and some of it is just plain unoriginal (The Ring features not 1 but 2 spooky horror film kids - an increasingly tiresome practice).  But overall I think that the American film is superior, it does successfully reconcile some of the jarring elements of the original's plot (again, I shouldn't mention any specific moments) and the story moves more naturally (the Japanese version relies heavily on psychic flashback - very lazy).
This film is in my opinion one of the best examples of a supernatural thriller to come out of any country in recent years.  I never expected the Americans to pull it off but they have.  Sure, there are some cheesy bits included for people with no imagination, but there are also some awesome moments of suspense, violence and the final revealation is stunnning and will not readily let go of you.
* some of the effects used in the original have proved quite influential it seems.  I was watching Stir of Echoes (pretty bog-standard) a few days ago and noticed that the apparition in Kevin Sausage's home moves in the same disjointed and jerky way that Sadako-chan does.  The only problem being that there is actually no reason for the apparition to move in this way and it is, once again, included merely for effect.  Cheap.",1050796800,,3070,4.867562380038388
1407223,3,B000059HCH,"To like this movie, you have to enjoy two things: fractured stories and unease.  If you are looking for continuous gore or jumps, you won't have it here.  If you are looking for the Mystery Machine to drive up and the end and explain it all, then look elsewhere.
Part of what is so creepy about this movie is that you have to try and figure out why even after watching it.  No one gives you a tidy ending so that you can sleep.  I thought having a few quick flashes of scary stuff worked well, because you kept waiting for it to happen, but never knew when.  The ending is a good one because it doesn't follow typical Hollywood fare.
The only bad side is that you tend to forget about the characters in trying to figure out what's going on, and in doing so you lose some interest in what happens to them.  They aren't developed very well, but then again, you are concerned with the tape before the main character.  The kid in the movie also needed to have some more dynamic than he did.  He's too informed too early on.
Overall, I liked it quite a bit.  It doesn't try to make you need a new pair of shorts; more of it seems to be in making you feel weird for days to come.",1050796800,3,1173,4.109649122807017
1407224,1,B000059HCH,"Right at the beginning you're forced into excepting a fairly outrageous premise from this movie. People who watch a video tape die within seven days of viewing it. Ok, pretty dumb premise, but I've seen worse. I've got an open mind. Especially whens it comes to horror movies. Next, great image of a girl who gets scared to death. Very chilling. Very cool. Now we get to see what's on the tape. Extremely gothic images in jump cut. Wow, fantastic production values. Now, I'm intrigued. I think, we may be in for something special. But, instead I'm taken on an investigation into the history of a little girl who's making all this happen. How? Why? What? Why did the horse jump off the boat? Why did this girl get killed? Her father doesn't want her and that gives Mommy Dearest the impetus to kill her? Huh? The little girl is making videos with her ghostly mind to kill people? What for? Revenge? Against who?...........Against me for watching this movie all the way through. Who cares? I didn't. But if I was bankrolling this, I'd sure be asking these questions. But it just shows to go ya, Hollywood can lay any kind of pooh pooh and people will pay to see it. I know I did. And over 500 people reviewed it. Now, if I can just stop one person from seeing this.....
Hollywood justs seems to be sinking deeper and deeper with this genre. Whomever wrote this Screenplay should be forced to watch their own creation over and over, eyeballs open, ala Clockwork Orange, for eternity. That would be worse than what happened to the characters who watched the fatal tape in this movie. Oops, I called it a movie. Sorry. What really insulted my intelligence was the pretension of the film makers. Too much Drama going nowhere. If you got no story, bombard me with special effects. I can take it. Did anyone else notice VIDEODROME?
Even though flicks in this genre hardly ever have one, a decent payoff is in order. Beware!! This one has the worst denouement in recent memory. Don't Actors and Producers read scripts anymore?
Gets one star for the deadly gothic video tape. The rest is a waste. See FRAILTY instead. It's one of the best to come out in the genre in a long while.
THIS made NO sense. And I was smoking loads.
BAD DOG, I mean, HORROR MOVIE!! BAD!!",1050710400,2,2253,4.5245098039215685
1407225,5,B000059HCH,"At the horrid beginning for such a good movie (a beginning which was a very large turnoff for many people I suggested this movie to), some things happen that you don't understand at first.  You really need to see the movie for a second time to understand the beginning.  But basically, Katie, the not-bad-looking dark-brown haired female with slight highlights, takes a slightly joking approach to the video when her friend Becca tells her about it, but when odd things happen downstairs and when the tv begins to seem to malfunction, she begins to slightly lose her cool, and just minutes later, she is dead.  Becca is driven mad by this, and ends up into a psychiatric hospital.  It'd be quite ironic if the hospital was 'Eola', since that is the hospital used all the time in this movie...you have to see the movie to understand the irony.
Rosie, Katie's mother, tells Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a news reporter, to use her skills to find out what happened to her daughter since a sixteen-year-old girl's heart stopping is not a very common occurence, to say the least.  This is how Rachel ends up finding out that Katie was not the only person to die at that time on that day.  Her and three of her friends died at the exact same time on the exact same day.  This is how Rachel fidns the tape...and, thanks to her investigative curiosity, she watches it.
It is obvious that she is trying to remain calm when she first sees the tape and its disturbing images, but she slightly fails if you look at the disgusted face she is making.  A nice little close-up of her contracting pupil shows her true emotions: fear.  But she still does not believe it...until, seconds later, her phone rings.  She picks it up and is to afraid to even say ""Hello"", but the ?person? on the other line is not interested in greetings, immediately whispering the message, ""Seven days...""
Rachel finds out that she has only seven days left to live.  This means that her face will end up looking just like Katie's did when she died.  This is when I take back what I said before about being ""not-bad-looking"".  When you see how she looked after she died, you'd think the same thing.  That would be an interesting first date.  Her body was curled up slightly and her skin looked as if it had been UNDER WATER for several days.
But anyway, Rachel, with the help of her ?ex-husband? with whom she had a child, Aidan, tries to fidn out what exactly the images on the tape mean.  This leads to a complex chain of events (with MANY subliminal messages...look carefully at the transition between the horse-on-the-ferry scene and the Noah-at-Eola scene...).  That include Rachel trying to find out how to stop the tape until her time begins to come and her seventh day slowly starts and slowly ends, when she discovers why the tape exists but knows it has to be too late to stop it.
The thing I like about this movie is that the original author, Koji Suzuki (or Suzuki Kojie?  It's as if his last name and first name switch around at will) didn't leave a single detail that he could possibly put in out.  This includes the odd and wavy texture of people's faces in photographs and video recordings afer watching the tape.  Something that was good about the original book, Ringu, was the fact that there were some things that stayed misteries even past the ending that you yourself are supposed to find out.
This leads to one of my largest dislikes about the movie.  The movie explained too many things--like why it was seven days.  I always skip that part of the movie because it is so annoying to have them explain everything that I can't listen to it every one of the many times that I watch the movie.
The acting was excellent.  I read (unfortunately not misread) a review about somebody complainign about Rachel's jumpiness from comport to easily-rattled.  This should be here!  She tries her hardest to be a typical mother but at tiems she simply can't act like everything is fine.  If you saw a gruesome face containing rotted skin and an expression of sheer excruciating pain and suffering, I'm quite sure that you would scream also (the scream that is on the cover of the DVD happens at that point).
I liked the way that it had a complex plot that really needs to be thought over.  Also, the graphics are so amazing I would never think they existed.  The most computerized-looking parts of the entire movie (the faces of the people who died and Samarah while attempting to kill somebody in a strange way requiring the use of a television) are the parts that are not computerized.  Samara (Deviegh Chase) was filmed walking at that point and was even filmed while walking upon the actual floor of Noah's apartment--computer editing only made her look more ""bad-reception"" like.  Almost every single image on the tape, however, was computerized.  I would never have believed that nowhere in the entire movie was there a single real fly filmed, but flies show up all over the place in the movie.
This movie is a must-see for everyone who is ready to think--which, I hate to say, most Americans are not.  That is why this movie was a watered-down version of the Japanese movie.  However, this is still my favorite movie!  I highly reccomend it.

The remake attempts to add more detail but winds up being more confusing in the end.
While I didn't find this one too scary, it really shook up my dog.  He reacts strongly to loud sub woofer noises (things blowing up usually upset him), and there must have been something in the audio on this one, because he refused to sit still.  I had to shut the movie off halfway through and take him for a walk before he would calm down.  His behavior scared me a lot more than anything in the movie.

1407242,3,B000059HCH,"The Ring isn't your scare a minute, pop-up horror, scariest film of all time, the film tries to present itself in an atmosphere that's creepy. The atmosphere from the colors in the movie, to the way it was filmed, really drives the movie. Like I said before, this isn't a scare a minute movie, but when you go to sleep at night, you won't be able to help but think of this movie. The mood set is so creepy, and the movie is driven by that mood, and a suprisingly interesting mystery. There's a story that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in 7 days. A woman finds the tape after a niece of her's dies, and watches it. She decides to uncover the mystery of the tape before the 7 days is up.
The set up might sound like another teen horror movie, but it's not. The movie has its moments where you will jump out of your seat, but the movie definatley sets a creepy tone, and for a night or two, you might have the leave the lights on. This movie isn't driven by sex or gore, it's intended to creep out the audience, which is does. This isn't your average movie, and is far better than any ""horror"" movie you will see today. It isn't the best scary movie, but it will sure as hell be in the back of your mind for the next few days after you watch it.
But unlike the movie, the DVD isn't so great. This could've gotten 4 stars, even 5 if this movie had more extras. You can see a preview of the Japanease version of the The Ring, ""Ringu"" and the ""tape"" that makes you die in seven days. Well not really, but its pretty creepy thinking about it. And maybe 1 more thing or 2, but that's about it. It's really ashame the DVD isn't as good as everyone hoped, because the movie is great.

1407245,4,B000059HCH,"When I saw ""The Ring"" at my local theater last fall was impressed enough by its wonderfully creeped-out vibe that I made it a point to pick it up on DVD when it the stores.  Having watched it last night though I felt a bit disappointed.
Yes, the film still holds its impact on the small screen.  In fact, given its storyline it's arguably better watched on a TV than in a theater.  But my complaint with ""The Ring"" DVD is that it feels like it was thrown together quickly to get it in stores early while it's still ""hot"" from its recent theatrical run.
Certainly it wouldn't be the first time. ""Dogma,"" ""X Men,"" ""Memento,"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" are just a few movies that were released in relatively bare bones DVD formats that were later followed by deluxe Special Editions bursting at the seams with extras.  The challenge this obviously creates for fans when it happens is they then have to decide if they want to buy the same movie twice.
Now maybe that won't happen here.  Perhaps the plan was always to make ""The Ring"" a lean DVD release in recognition of the fact that many discs are overloaded with their ""everything AND the kitchen sink"" set of extras.  Really, unless you're unemployed do you have the time to sit through your average ""2-disc set loaded with EIGHT hours of deleted scenes, featurettes, documentaries, storyboards, and trailers""? Probably not.
However, given the price of the typical DVD, a healthy set of extras can make you feel like you got your money's worth, something you may not feel after buying this movie.
This is a film that, for example, cries out for a ""Making of"" documentary, one that could have not only highlighted the production but also its roots in Japan.  ""The Ring"" is actually a pretty faithful remake of Hideo Nakata's 1998 thriller ""Ringu.""  That film was based on a novel by Koji Suzuki and its success abroad spawned not only one but two other films, the sequel ""Ringu 2"" and prequel ""Ringu 0.""
But casual viewers won't find any of this out because no such documentary is present here.  While the DVD does include a trailer for ""Ringu,"" that's the only reference to the original source material.  As for the much ballyhooed original short film that was created by director Gore Verbinski, especially for this disc, it's just a compilation of footage of the film, deleted scenes, and imagery from the movie's ""cursed video.""
Though the alleged intent is to ""reveal more electrifying secrets about the mystery"" of the film (which some moviegoers apparently found confusing), there's nothing here that careful viewers won't have already ascertained from having watched the film the first time.
And that's it for your extras.  No director's or actors' commentaries, no shooting script, no storyboards, nothing else.
Ultimately, this DVD is worth buying for fans of the movie.  Its hauntingly beautiful cinematography practically cries out for the pristine picture quality that DVDs provide.
Still some cost-conscious fans may wait until ""The Ring"" 2-disc Special Edition ""loaded with EIGHT hours deleted scenes, featurettes, documentaries, storyboards, and trailers"" hits store shelves.  I have a feeling it won't be a long wait.",1050192000,,3180,4.877551020408164

John Waters, for years now has been saying he only likes to make movies with ""edge"". They say they want to break away from formula Hollywood and make daring, bold, films. Movies that lack convention. I admit, I do enjoy seeing something different. I like movies that try to experiment with new techniques. But, I also noticed that many of these young new filmmaker are forgetting something. They are so worried about ""breaking the rules"", they are so concerned with creating odd situation after odd situation, just so they can say they're films are different and they are a work of art, that they leave out one of the most fundamental rules of movies. The audience has to care about the characters. When I watch a movie I don't care if the lead character is a man or woman, whether or not they share my same ideas of politics, religion, or whatever. All I ask is that I at least find the character to be interesting enough, where I'm willing to give my emotions to the character. That's what makes a great movie. When the movies is over, we feel we ourslves have went through the same journey as the characters in the film. Once in a while a movie will remember this rule. David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" was one of those movies. It was one of the most mind-blowing complex movies I've seen in a while. But, Gore Verbinski's ""The Ring"" is a movie that just didn't move me the way it could have or should have.
 I see a lot of people enjoy this movie. They find the movie to be scary, and how can I tell someone who thinks something is scary it isn't? That's like telling someone don't laugh at that joke, I didn't find it funny. But, ""The Ring"" just gets a little too odd for it's own good. Now, don't get me wrong, the movie starts off well. And I do admire Naomi Watts as an actress. I think she is very talented. I even wanted to see this movie when it was released. So, I was going into the movie with high expectations. I wanted to like. But ""The Ring"" lost my attention in the middle and through the end. The movie just becomes and series of bizarre events where, for me, 1+1 doesn't equal 2. Think of Kafka but without the brains. Is it surreal? Yes. Does it make sense? Not really. Could the movie work? Yes.
 I haven't seen the original foreign version of this movie. Now, it may be better or it may be worst. But if it's as werid as this movie, I don't want to see it.
 ""The Ring"" tells the story of a woman (Naomi Watts) who learns about a video tape that has a collection is meaningless things on it, but, after I think it was 7 days, whoever watches the tape dies. Of course the movie goes into other things, and there is more added to the story, but, I'll let you rent the movie to find out what. I've given you a vague summary of the movie. Believe it or not, but in the beginning of the movie the story works. I didn't find the movie to be scary, but, I did find it to be interesting, and that's all I really ask of any movie. Just be able to hold my interest. And ""The Ring"" does reach it goal. It's actually enjoyable to watch at first, and than, it gets werid. Now, I know what all of you are thinking. I just said I liked ""Mulholland Dr."" and that was a werid movie, so what's my problem here? How ever werid ""Mulholland Dr."" may have got, it always held my interest. I wanted to see how the movie would end because I cared enough about the character to know. I didn't really care enough about the characters in ""The Ring"" to care how it ended. And that breaks the movie. If they just would of added a bit of logic to the movie. If they would of made the movie more believeable I could of enjoyed it more. Isn't that what makes a movie scary? If what is happening in the movie seems real enough that it could happen in real life? Those are the kinds of movies that scary me. Not this kind of movie.
 Are there things to be enjoyed while watching this movie. Well, if your a young filmmaker and you say you like to see movies with an ""edge"", here you go! If you like Naomi Watts, and want to her all her movies again, here you go. Watts does in all fairness do a good job. She does give the character a certain level of heart need to carry our interest, but, it seems like no one else is helping her out. One person can't carry a movie by themself. Especially this type of movie.
 Bottom-line: Has some good points to it, but, over-all I wasn't scared by the movie. It gets too odd, and the audience can't really connect with anyone or anything. Goes a bit over the top and becomes silly at moments. Watts does though give a nice performance.",1049760000,3,4690,4.224080267558528

There are some creepy moments, but the minute you start to analyze the movie, it just falls apart. The only thing that keeps it from being a total dud is the production quality ... and the fact that Naomi Watts is quite a looker.  As for those people who say it's ""the scariest movie ever"" I have to wonder what other movies they've seen.

But anyway I probably shouldve seen it on big screen instead, sounds like it was scarier.  One part I didn't understand was when Samara climbed out of the tv screen.  Is that possible even for a ghost to do. You should go and see The Ring just for the visuals.  Verbinksi tried his hardest.  Naomi Watts did a good job as the main character Rachel and I was surprised with the boys acting ability.  Decent acting, huh, rare for a horror movie.

1407277,5,B000059HCH,"There are not many horror movies that make your skin crawl, that make you cringe in your seat, that make your spine shiver. The Ring is one of them. This relatively gore-free film is that special something everyone should own on a DVD or a video. It is a combination of suspense and thriller. The gore is practically non-existent. Yet, the fear factor climbs up high on the scale. Never ever could I imagine being scared of a little girl more than a house full of monsters- up until I saw The Ring. The evil in the little girl is so intense, so radiating that it makes me shudder just thinking about her. In this fantastic masterpiece, there are many ""jump"" scenes. The music is so eerie it makes you sit in your seat and widen your eyes with shock and with suspense of what the next moment might bring. The Ring is as unpredictable as you can get - you never know what will happen next, you have no clue on how the film will end.
The fatal videocasette alone is a masterpiece. With almost no gore, it contains disturbing images playing in your mind afterwards - maggotts crawling out of peoples mouths, dead horses, a woman in a mirror combing her hair, a ladder leading god knows where. I remember the creeps it was giving me when I saw it in the theatres.
The acting is excellent. The cast consists of some known actors, however, most of them are relatively unknown. They create an atmosphere so tense you could cut it with a knife. They co-star together so beautifully you can't help but think you are really in the movie with them.
Everything about this movie is really good and it is the creepiest movie i have seen in a really long time!",1049587200,3,1644,4.39344262295082
1407278,5,B000059HCH,"The creators of this film obviously did their research!  This remake not only covers the central plot of the Japanese thriller, Ringu, it also takes into account events of Ringu II and the original content of the novels.  This makes The Ring a nice condensed version of the ""Ring"" story on a whole.  The movie itself is very dark.  Tints of blue, green, and grey make the entire package very bleak as well.  One of the few complaints one my have about the movie is that it tries to hard to be scary.  After we get to see the tape, we're taken on a ride of shocks and chills as the days count down and those creepy, seemingly random images come to life.  Keep in mind that while a lot of the images are relevant to the plot, many do not appear or have any part in Ringu.  A lot was added, mostly for the effect.  What's nice, however, is that most of the creepy tidbits and add-ons are fairly (if not very) effective at making people jump.  There's a lot of great eye candy in The Ring, which is nice for movie goers who are in it more for the thrill than for subtlty.  There's also a lot of symbolism.  Just something fun to do, as you watch, try to think about what the ""ring"" actually is in this movie.  In my opinion, there's more than one ring.
The story seems simple enough.  A reporter, Rachel Keller, through the death of her niece, hears the urban legend of a video tape that kills the viewer.  First, you watch it, then you get a phone call in which a creepy voice says, ""Seven days.""  Then you have one week before you die.  There's no stopping it.  When Rachel is given a reason to believe the tale, she hunts down the video for herself, then finds herself watching it.  As the clock starts to count down the time she has left, she consults the help of an old friend, Noah, to help her solve the mystery of the video tape.  We are led to an interesting phrase:  ""Before you die, you see the ring.""
The cast is pretty good, but not exceptional.  Naomi Watts as Rachel does a decent job, but Ringu's Reiko (Matsushima Nanako) seemed to have more natural nervous yet composed air to her, while Rachel was sometimes either too composed or too easily rattled.  One of the remake's biggest mistakes was making the part of Aiden so cliche.  In Ringu, he served his purpose merely as the quiet and eerie son who is put in danger.  In The Ring, he is given some sort of psychic ability that we learn little about.  Yet somehow, he is able to predict his cousin's death through pictures and gets messages from a mysterious little girl.  In a way, this dehumanizes him a bit, and he's no longer the innocent little boy that the role seemed to call for.  The actress for Samara, however, was perfect for the part.  Both innocent and creepy, which easily manipulated most of the viewers.  The ending sequence is kept in tact as very similar to the one in Ringu.  Both versions are quite chilling and disturbing, although I did not like the break they made in the Noah/Samara sequence when we see Rachel rushing to get to Noah's.  That didn't seem necessary and made the best part of the movie slightly choppy.  Still, the imagery for many of the key scenes is brilliant.
So in conclusion, The Ring is a very well-done and thorough remake of Ringu, including many key parts of the story found in the Japanese sequels as well as some extra tidbits made just for this adaption.  The story is left in tact, making The Ring and Ringu very comparable, and the cast is strong enough to carry the story where needed.  The special effects and symmetry play a key role in this movie, but are used quite effectively.  Who says a PG-13 horror flick can't scare the heck out of you anyway?

1407294,3,B000059HCH,"The Ring is the American version of a Japanese film called Ringu (or Ring, there seems to be some controversy over this for some reason), which was a huge hit pretty much everywhere in the world but the U.S., where it wasn't distributed.  The original film is a quiet, dark, creepy exercise in atmospheric horror, and it is quite effective.  The American version, while incorporating a scene or two from the excellent Japanese sequel, Ring 2, sticks fairly close to its source material, but is, as you might expect from a more expensive Hollywood remake, flashier, slicker, more special-effects-dependent.  Even so, its considerably better than it might have been.  The filmmakers approached the material with at least a modicum of respect, and director Gore Verbinski seems to have a flair for the genre.  Neverthless, the result is a bit predictably dumbed-down, with some of the ambiguity inherent in the original removed.  Most notably, the video in the original consists of a series of bizarre images that, for the most part, are never explained.  In the American version, every sequence of the video is eventually assigned an explicit meaning.  Still, overall the film is well done, although it just isn't as effective as I wanted it to be.  Very likely I'd have liked it somewhat better if I hadn't seen the original first.",1049068800,,1330,4.954954954954955

Great acting job(even though she was better in Lilo & Stitch).  I will say that Samara looked really discusting at the end of the movie when she crawled out of the t.v.(eww).

All of these little things that people have told me make no sense, to avoid the specifics, the pictures as an example, can be explained if you think about it enough.  I'm not going to go into why that is, for the fact that I feel anybody who truly wants to figure it out can do so for themselves.
I was fortunate enough to be a projectionist who helped to put this movie together when it was in theaters, and therfore was allowed to watch it with only employees at a theater after hours.  We had the sound up a little higher than usual, and were prepared to be scared.
For those of you who were not fortunate enough to see it in either DTS sound or big-screen surround sound, I feel sorry that you missed the full affect of the films soundtrack.  The sounds that accompany the movies images and scenes that are designed to frighten you are ear breaking on a big screen with sorround sound, but leave something to be desired on the TV.
Moving past that, the images were disturbing, and I like the VHS opening with the video from the movie, rather than going straight into previews, however, I feel this ruins the affect the video has when it is first seen in the movie itself, so, for those of you who buy this on VHS, my advice is to fast-forward through the first, ohh, 1 minute or so, rather than watch it from the onset of coming attractions, and then, if you are interested, watch the very begining.
I do believe this is the scariest movie ever made, at least that I have seen, and I challenge people to find a scarier movie than this.  I feel it completely blew away the 1960's ""The Haunting"", which I was once told was terrifying, and the remake of that movie.  ""House on Haunted Hill"" didn't even come close to measuring up to this movies ability to disturb you.
Remember, everybody has a different idea of what scary is, and this movie was just a series of nightmares that I had as a little kid put on the screen, so naturally, it terrified me, I recommend watching this movie, scaring your friends with it, but remember, if you must watch it on a standard sized TV, do it alone, in the dark, and with the volume as loud as it can go.",1048464000,4,2259,4.241860465116279

You may have to see that movie first, but I think that this was MUCH scarier. I mean, Ringu was OK, but not as great as everyone says. But you have to take into consideration that that movie was made like 5 years ago and technology and film making have changed.

1407323,3,B000059HCH,"The good news is that there are several images in this movie that are truly frightening. Having said that, the rest of the movie undermines those images. The trouble is not with the acting, editing, cinematography, etc. The trouble is with the story itself. While the premise - evil child is born, threatens parents and horses and whatever else, is ""killed"" by parents, then returns from grave to kill again - is interesting, it is also highly unoriginal. The means by which the evil one kills is also not entirely original although the images used in telling the tale are quite effective. I think the problem here is that the storyline is so familiar that no amount of scary pictures and lighting will allow you to forget you are watching a rerun. Not only that, but the storyline is disconnected. How is Samara supposed to kill someone 7 days later if there is no television around? What is the purpose of the telephone call except to condition the audience to jump at the sound of a ringing phone? While answers to these questions may not be necessary in scaring the audience, they should have been explored more in telling the story. When the heroine realizes that it took 7 days for Samara to die, the explanation seemed gratuitous rather than important. Moreover, if she (Samara) ""never sleeps"" how could she be killed in the first place? This is a perfect example where a moviemaker relied too much on the photography and not nearly enough time on the story.",1048377600,3,1465,4.682170542635659

Maybe it's been the billions of horror films I've seen throughout the years, but I just don't see what everyone's messing their trousers over.  Of course we should all know by now that when a movie is hyped so much as being ""so scary""(see Blair Witch and Sixth Sense for more examples of this mass hysteria), it's usually a letdown.  The cold sweat inducing, heartstopping horror must have completely slipped past me.  I don't think so coz I really watched this film with a completely open mind and gave it 100% of my attention.  My opinion is that it wasn't there(the scares).  I can understand that this flick would scare the pants off of you if you don't watch many horror films, but to those fluent in them, we can see every ""scare"" coming a mile away.  And the whole ""psychic kid"" deal is pretty old.  Every horror film since The Shining seems to think a psychic kid means big scares.  Psychic kids are annoying.

Some people say that the story is very hard to follow but I did not have any trouble: its actually quite easy to understand. This is a very good horror film, better than anything that has come out so far this year, except maybe ""Dog Soldiers"". I say buy it, the DVD is worth the $$.",1048118400,2,630,4.277310924369748
1407337,3,B000059HCH,"The Ring is another horror movie that takes place with a simple plot: you watch a video, 7 days later you die. Simple right? Well actually not, the plot is actually more elaborate than that and the movie goes into great detail at the end to explain that. I did not find this movie to be scary at all, but then again I've seen enough horror movies in my lifetime to be desensitized from anything like this, however there are disturbing images in the movie....watch how white the girls face goes in the first part of the movie when she discovers her friend is dead...and the part where the little girl comes out the TV is a nice touch.
But the movie I actually found to be kind of boring until the end, sorry to say, but the ending leaves room for a sequel so I'm hoping that will explain a lot of things that this one did not. The spookiest part of the movie is the images which will stay in your brain for a long time...I saw this movie the week it came out and some of these images are still stuck with me now.
The plot attempts to explain itself towards the end, but by that time viewers are bored so all that is left is for more disturbing images to be shown to get you back into the movie. At least its better than Feardotcom, which made absolutely no sense at all.
I'm waiting for the sequel, hopefully that one will explain more than this one did. The movie is good for a quick visual scare, but thats it. Do not attempt to figure out the plot either, if you saw the preview for the 2nd one on the DVD, you know it goes way beyond watching a tape and dying 7 days later.
A solid effort, worth watching but not worth all the hype that was built up around it...",1048118400,2,1665,4.126153846153846
1407338,4,B000059HCH,"I'm under the impression that we aren't supposed to ""bash"" other reviewers, and that is not my intention, but some things were said in one previous review here, which, in the matter of fairness, need to be addressed.
--- ""Well, having seen the Japanese version the only way I can in the US, downloading it (a case could be made for buying an all-region or region 2 dvd player, but that's ridiculous)... And by the way, the Japanese version (based on a book, which is even MORE different yet) is unavailable currently in the states, despite being four years old (Which is not ""a long time ago"" as one other reviewer thought).
First of all, Ringu, the Japanese original is available on DVD (although to be fair, I don't think it was when this review was written).  And, to me, downloading an entire feature length film seems more ridiculous than getting yourself a region free DVD player.  And I think a ""long time ago"" is very subjective.  If someone last took a shower a ""long time ago"" then four years does apply.  And depending on the way someone sees movies, or is discussing a grouping of films, then four years could be a ""long time ago.""
--- ""I then saw this. What a mistake. This remake (would be more appropriate considering their choice to hide the fact that it is based on a far superior Japanese film) is terrible; unnecessary and laughable additions were made and much of interest was dropped (like, those character thingies, who are like people. but who needs any sense of real characters anyway?) such as the ability to use REAL suspense and SUBTLETY in favor of cheap shocks that weren't even shocking.""
Uhhh, to each his own, here I guess.  Except that I'm unaware of the remake trying to hide the fact that it was a remake.  I have not seen the original yet -- I should point that out.  And there's a good chance that I'll much prefer it to the remake.  But just because a film you love is remade into a lesser work, that doesn't really make it awful and terrible, etc.
--- ""Acting was...awful. I expected better of Naomi Watts, and knew nothing of the rest (except for the fact that they were in a relatively successful film now, I wouldn't expect to see much more of them either).""
This was my biggest complaint, most of the acting was fine, the kid was good, and Naomi Watts was outstanding.  In this review there seems a tendency to denounce everything about the film, because it was not liked.  But Naomi Watts was great here, and once or twice she screams so cinematically wonderful that I really think it's the best scream I've ever seen in a movie.
I actually give this film three and one-half stars but had to round up to four.  It's similar in style and mood, if not story, to The Others -- and it's obviously influenced by the success of that film.  The Ring is also not as good as The Others.
I compare it to The Others because they are similar types of films (even though the actual plots are nothing alike). Plus this film stars the amazing actress Naomi Watts, who is famously best friends with Nicole Kidman -- star of The Others.
What happens is you watch a videotape. Immediately after you get a phone call -- someone tells you you have 7 days to live. Then, of course, you die. So Naomi hears about this and tries to figure out what's going on (she's a journalist). There are plot holes; but the film has a neat, cold look and atmosphere. Naomi Watts is remarkable.
I still think that her performance in Mulholland Drive is, like, one of the greatest film performances of all time. This film isn't as deep, or important, cinematically, and it doesn't quite require the same workout of our star. But she is outstanding here. There are a couple of times when she screams, and I swear, bone-chilling, heart-breaking screams. The film is worth seeing for them alone. You see a little of that in the trailer, but you should see it within the context of the story.",1048032000,,3894,4.492220650636492

I truly believe that the movie was suppose to end happily by them finding the girl and setting her free, but that's when they realized ""oh crap, we totally ripped off Stir Of Echos, we should do a SURPRISE (stupid) ending. I know it sounds like I've been ripping on this movie, but the truth is, even if they did borrow a lot from the other movie, I still think this is better than Stir Of Echos.

Everytime i closed my eyes I kept seeing Samara Morgan coming for me. This movie creeped me out big time. While The Exorcist, I sat with a straight face all through the movie which I personally found quite boring, I wanted something that would scare me when i watched it and having heard everyone go ""Oh its so scary, its the scariest movie of all time"" I thought it would be. But The Ring, with the way it starts out heavy, then gently slows down, and makes you feel all warm and safe thinking that everything is going to be fine now and then BOOM everything is bad again. It was just a great roller coaster of a movie. And the fact that it doesnt try to explain WHY was ingenious. Things like this cant be figured out, it just is. I hate it when movies try to put some reasoning behind it because lots of people who watch movies allways feel like there should be a motive.

Her ex husband then watches the film the day after and then the next day her son watches the tape ( He can speak to the little girl who died, She was thrown down the well ) Anyway the lady decides to make a copy of the video and then they went to the cabin where her nieces friends watched the video. She found the well under the cabin. It was day 7 since she watched the film - Her day to die. The T.V hits her and she falls down the well to find the little girls body. ...

Yes, Naomi Watts is a fantastic beautiful actress and does a great job along with the boy who plays her son.  Yes, the plotline was a fantastic one that could have been developed better.
But in the end, you are left with a movie that doesn't explain why the ""entity"" is killing people, where this ""entity"" came from, nor how to defeat it.  Unless they come up with a sequel/prequel movie that answers my concerns above, then this movie will have been a waste for me.",1047945600,3,763,4.614814814814815

Still, it's full of holes.  The origin of the videotape never gets explained and we never get a reasonable explanation for how these people are getting these creepy phone calls from dead people.  They really expect you to suspend way too much disbelief however and that ultimately pulls the movie down.

1407356,4,B000059HCH,"First of all, I'd like to say that all my friends thought this movie was the scariest movie they had ever seen and I've heard some people saying its scarier than the exorcist. Ridiculous. The Exorcist is a much scarier film than this. Maybe its just becasue I had heard so much about it that i didn't find it too scary intitially, but a couple scenes were just hilarious (im thinking of the ones with the horse and the old guy electrocuting himself, both of which were supposed to be scary,) This certaintly isn't the scariest movie ever.
 Now that being said, I will say that this movie is scary. Not the scariest film ever. But effectively creepy. Gore Verbinski is generally good at building suspense, and The little girl in it is pretty freaky, even though this whole 'Sinister and/or mysterious children' thing is kind of a cliche in horror movies. Psychological?...I guess, but it could have been more so. The scene where the videotape is shown to the audience wasn't so scary for me, maybe because i had already viewed it online months earlier on some upcoming movies site (no,I didn't get a phone call), thought the first time I saw it I was fairly spooked. The film moved at a good pace and was interesting and enough to keep me from never being bored, and it was cool how it eventually turned into a sort of family drama and the the very end was unexpecedly artsy. There were too many false endings before it though. I wanna see the japanese version, cause ive heard its scarier.
 All in all, I'd give this film about 31/2 stars if possible, but I decided to go with four. Generally a scary movie, though it may take a while to realize the scariness of some parts, but it doesnt compare to the exorcist or even the sixth sense, which I thought was also scarier than this film.",1047859200,,1786,4.475460122699387

The movie probably has 1 or 2 big scary moments, but that's it.  Overall, it's more of a mystery (and an interesting and mildly disturbing one at that) than a horror flick.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that for a movie to be scary it has to make you jump out of your seat or anything cheesey like that, but when you watch this film expecting a certain kind of experience, and it delivers something totally different, it takes away from what you could've enjoyed had you walked into the movie totally uninformed...
THIS IS NOT A SCARY MOVIE!!!
If you want to watch a good movie that makes you think and keeps you on the edge of your seat, check this out because, as I stated before, it is a v. good film, but if you're a horror buff and just want some genuine spine-tingling chills, you might wanna stay away from this and watch something genuinely creepy like The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby.",1047772800,,1171,4.3577981651376145

Fans of ghost movies may recognize a bit of ""The Changling"" here.  But ""The Ring"" is different enough from that to be its own movie.  There's an upsetting part dealing with a horse too.  I just consoled myself by realizing animals are not allowed to be hurt making film.

I would put this on a par with Brian Depalma's Hitchcockian ode ""Sisters"", ""Jacobs Ladder"" or the more recent ""Stir of Echoes"" all of which are far more frightening than any slasher film.

Naomi Watts is a great up-and-coming actress, and absolutely stunning on-screen. If you want to see more of her, check out Lynch's Mulholland Drive.  The video, which plot centers  on, is very eerie indeed and invokes the surrealistic films of Salvador Dali. (those surreal film festivals are everywhere in this city)
Effects were understated, as they should be for this type of film, except for one mediocre effects sequence (by today's standards), which was thankfully short. There were some plot holes which could easily be overlooked. The film has a creepy way of drawing the viewer into the story as it unfolds...but the ending falls somewhat flat. (although correctly left open-ended)  The child-neglect subtext was rather weak as well or could it be a ruse to fool the characters or possibly the viewer as well?
I can't help but think that there is some dark satirical message - the imagery seeks to tease the viewer by blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. (perhaps a send-up of the horror genre?)

The story revolves around a newpaper reporter (Naomi Watts) investigating a mysterious videotape that supposedly causes its viewers to die within 7 days of viewing. Attention must be paid--some plot points are hard to follow--but it's well worth the effort.  The images from the tape are deeply disturbing, especially when all is revealed by the equally chilling story behind it.

I did not see this movie at the theatre but finally did see it on DVD this past Monday. I had heard how cool it was, how creepy and scary it was, and how ""smart"" it was for a horror movie. Well, I found it boring, not scary and predictable... The movie ""spoon feeds"" you the plot/story to you the whole time. How could you not know how it will end after seeing the fly ""come alive""? Two people I watched it with had seen it in the theatre. They claimed after watching the ""short film"" made for the DVD that half of the sceens in the short film were actually in the theatrical version. I can't speak to that, but can say it wouldn't have made me like this movie anymore than I already did. I may have to say I'm getting old and am now ""out of touch"", but I'd rather watch Halloween, Evil Dead or Texas Chainsaw over The Ring every time!",1047600000,,972,4.121052631578947

As I write this, the day after my first viewing, I still get goosebumps thinking about certain scenes. The ONLY bad part about this movie is that it left so many unanswered questions and on the whole, didn't make a lot of sense. I hear a sequel is in the works so hopefully that will shed some light on it.
Still, I'm going to probably be more generous than I should with my score because the movie gave me more chills than I've had in a while.",1047600000,,619,4.391304347826087

For that, I'll only give it four stars, because aside from these flaws, this was a seriously creepy movie. I thought it was infinitely scarier and more believable than the ridiculous ""Signs."" I agree with many of the comparisons people have made with ""The Exorcist."" Aside from the fact that cute, seemingly harmless little girls feature prominently in both stories, ""The Ring"" resembles ""The Exorcist"" in its dark, malevolent mood. Like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" this is a horror movie blissfully free of blood and gore. The horror of this film comes from hints at things unseen and incredibly disturbing imagery. I've heard many people complain about the twist ending- indeed, it would have been fine with me if the film had ended fifteen minutes earlier. I will say that this ending, unecessary as it might have been, provides one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen on film. I found Naomi Watts to be wonderful in this role, almost as impressive as her part in ""Mulholland Drive."" She really held this movie together for me, because I wasn't particularly enamoured with the other actors (not to say that they were bad). I haven't yet seen the Japanese version of this film (though I have looked for it), so I can't make comparisons. It wouldn't surprise me if this is a dumbed down, Americanized version (see ""The Vanishing"" for a particularly egregious example of this phenomenon).

1407374,3,B000059HCH,"While watching ""The Ring"", the last thing I wanted to do was to draw comparisons with the original Japanese ""Ringu"". Simply because I wanted to enjoy it as what it is, rather than a revisited English version of a same film. Unfortunately, I found comparisons to be inevitable. Not saying that ""The Ring"" is either superior or inferior, but it stayed very truthful to the original material it was based on, too truthful.
For viewers who haven't had a chance to see ""Ringu"", you will find idea of ""The Ring"" wholly unique, nevertheless bizarre and ridiculous at the same time, depending on your cynicism level. But for those who have seen the original, you may think that the story of this US remake unfolds in an almost identical way, even though some incidents along the way were inserted or slightly altered to cater for the vaster audiences. In certain cases these alterations are actually an improvement that contributes to the mood of the story, as well as providing hints and clues of the final conclusion. In Japan, like in China and many other countries in Asia, they have long history that consists of countless mythical tales and legends about the spiritual realm, so a cursed video may seem vividly possible, while seems far-fetched and hard to swallow to the English-speaking world. But in order to retain that sense of myth, a lot of elements converted (or rather not converted) into the US version do feel quite out of place.
Verbinski, while flaring some ingenious camera setups, did not tackle the subtlety a movie that is largely atmospheric requires. ""The Ring"" is a material which M. Night Shyamalan could probably do while he sleepwalks, and his knack for psychological thrills and minimalism style would surely be effective here. Perhaps looking at Verbinski's rsum (Mousehunt, The Mexicans), he may be too cynical for a subject that deals with a video tape that kills people. However with the limited amount of Gore (no puns intended), he did succeed in letting some genuine chills creep into the audiences at the sublimal level.
Where ""The Ring"" did fail is, not having convincing characters. Naomi Watts serves up a decent job as a career-driven news reporter, but she did not look frightened or concerned enough for a single-mother who knows her exact time and date of death. There was no sense of emergency that she is desperate to find out how to lift the curse, instead she spends the entire time questioning who was involved in the sad story behind the video. By the end of the seventh day the audiences are left to wander off somewhere forgetting why she needs to find out about the origin of the video in the first place. Secondly the son Aidan is too creepy, and without a trace of innocence for us to really care about what will happen to him. He shares no chemistry with his mother, spending the entire time staring into the far place, drawing dark pictures, or mumbling something about a imaginary friend. In another word, he seems more like a possessed puppet than your little nephew you would like to take to the carnival. In Alejandro Amenavar's ""The Others"", in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", or even in the most obvious example, Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", children's straightforward manner and innocence proved to be far more effective in creating sense of peril, and in that matter, way more disturbing. Another disappointing performance is from Martin Henderson as Noah. He has great presence, but again he does not convey any chemistry with the other actors in the film. The expression he has for not believing the nonsense of a killer video is not so different from the one he knows his life could be in threat. Is he helping Rachel because he does have feelings for her, or does he just hope to get laid again because she is still hot? It was not explained, nor do we really care much.
Though the number of extras on this DVD is disappointing, what it does offer is in fact quite neat. The picture is sharp and crisp, providing a good contrast of the grayish grim look of the film, with the bursting colors at times that will permanently damage your retina (in some way it actually distracts you from the mood the film is supposed to have). While the sound may not give your system a throughout workout, the localization is quite well defined, and provide a good dimension for the otherwise monotone sound effects, therefore making the few shock-tricks exceptionally powerful (needless to say the DTS track again proves to be the champion of cinema sound).
An advertised ""never-before-seen short film"" could be seen by selecting the ""Don't look here"" option on the main menu. It is in fact a collection of deleted and extended scenes, featuring a few more graphic sequences trimmed from the theatrical release. Without commentary or additional information, it doesn't really reveal any more insights or secret than the film itself, but would definitely affect the rating if they were incorporated back into the film as an ""uncut edition"". Yet whether it would be a better viewing experience is another question. Also included is a very brief trailer of the original ""Ringu"" on DVD (also released by Dreamworks, surprise, surprise!), a theatrical trailer of ""Catch Me If You Can"", and an ""8 Mile"" DVD promo spot. If you are patient enough to play around with the remote a little bit more, you may find a not so pleasant easter egg! Overall ""The Ring"" DVD is a nice little package that will make your collection looks better...is that your phone ringing?",1047513600,2,5502,4.8048523206751055
1407375,3,B000059HCH,"Rented the RING last night and watched ""the 3 scary parts"" this morning, so this review is fresh!  I like to bulletize my reviews to break things down to basics.  So here goes....

-I was concidering buying this....  maybe if it goes on deep discount.
-The film has a very spooky feal to it but not many scares.  I was most startled by cenetipede crawling out from under a paper.
-The story has too many holes (no pun intended) to count.  Perhaps if they didn't try to explain any of it I would have accepted it.
-This has ""Sequel"" written all over it.  ""Ringu"" has 2 sequels.
-If you like the feal but not the story, try ""The Shining"".  Much more cohesive without explaining everything.
-Camera work is outstanding.
-Excellent use of music and sound(or quiet)to set the mood.
-Some of the deleated scenes should be put back.  Why not?  The story is already disjointed.
-A very quiet movie that forces you to turn up the volume...  ... then ZAPS you with something loud but perhaps not scary.
-The video was the most spooky thing in the film.  If it just lead to something....
-This is a ""scary mystery"" story.  The problem is the clues don't really solve anything.  It all turned out to be pointless.
-""The Exorcist"" with aging special affects is still much scarier than this, and it actually has a beginning and an end.
-5 better movies that will leave you fealing disturbed and uneasy:  Shining, Exorcist, ""living Dead"" trilogy, Silence of the lambs and the original ""Hellraiser"". (now that's scary!)

This film left me wanting.  Rent it first.

If you don't mind having questions about the movie that will not get answered, the visual effects might keep you happy.

1407378,3,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is one of the most successful horror movies of recent years and is sure to spawn a series of sequels. I have mixed feeling about it. It is meticulously crafted. The cinematography is some of the best I saw in 2002. It is nothing if not atmospheric.  The problem I have with it is that it seems to be all about technique. I don't find it particularly scary, although that may be because its premise doesn't arouse any of my personal phobias. And I think it's choppy script structure gives it an ambiguity which leads many viewers to think it has hidden meaning. It doesn't, as far as I can see.
Rachel Keller [Naomi Watts] is a young reporter whose life is thrown into disarray after her teenaged niece dies mysteriously of a heart attack. Friends of the deceased tell her that the girl watched a bizarre videotape with three of her friends. They say that anyone who watched it does in seven days. When Rachel discovers that all four teens dies at the same time on the same day, she starts to investigate. She locates the tape, which she watches. Moments later the phone rings, and a voice tells her that she has a week left to live.  Soon, both her ex-boyfriend and her young son have seen it. Rachel begins a frantic search to find the tape's origin and to undo its curse.
The movie's high visual style and competent acting were enough to make me find it fairly enjoyable. Towards the end, there is explanation after explanation, which I found tedious because, rather than leaving the viewer with tantalizing ambiguities, the movie insists on providing answers which are increasingly silly. It becomes complex for no valid reason, other than to show a triumph of style over substance. This isn't to say that the movie isn't fun, it's to say that that's all it is.",1047427200,3,1775,4.561128526645768

1407380,4,B000059HCH,"A remake of the Japanese movie ""Ringu"", the Ring is a surprisingly effective horror flick. The story centers on a video tape that when watched, will find the viewer dead in exactly 7 days time.  Naomi Watts plays a Seattle reporter who investigates the death of her niece, a victim of said video tape.  When Naomi watches the tape the countdown to her own death begins.  What follows is her search to uncover the mystery of the tape to save her life as well as her son's and her estranged boyfriend.  The road leads to a frightening little girl with supernatural powers named Samara.  I understand there is a Japanese sequel that fleshes out the story of Samara.  Based on how well this movie did, I would guess we may get a remake of that sequel as well.
The movie is full of disturbing and unsettling images.  The atmosphere is kept ""cold"" and dark throughout.  In my opinion, it is difficult to make a movie that's actually scary.  So many things have been done before.  The Ring succeeds in doing something different.  I got more than my share of chills while watching this movie.
The DVD transfer is stunning.  The subdued colors of the rainy Seattle days look great.  The sound track has both Dolby 5.1 and dts.  The dts track was so clear it sounded as if it was actually raining in my room.  The extras are limited to a couple of trailers (including one for the DVD of the original film, Ringu) and a short film which is really a series of deleted and alternate scenes.  I have seen criticism of this extra, but I though it was quite well put together.

1407383,4,B000059HCH,"This is the scariest movie I have seen in probably the last 5 years.  It is also one of those great ones that you and a friend can talk about afterwards, trying to interpret the ending.
I am mystified by the people comparing it to the original Japanese version and complaining.  I rented ""Ringu"" last night from my neighborhood Blockbuster, and for the first hour the two films were virtually identical, shot for shot.  Granted the climax is much creepier in the original, however I thought it was ridiculous how the entire plot exposition was achieved because the boyfriend was psychic, so magically knew all the answers to her questions.  This was a cheap shortcut that cuts about a half-hour out compared to the American version (but given she only had a week to solve the mystery, this must have come in handy.  Leads one to wonder what she spent the other 23 hours of the day doing?) I found the American version far more believable based on this fact alone.  Not to mention only half the imagery in the video is explained in ""Ringu"", whereas the American version ties everything together neatly and logically by the end.
Regardless of comparisons, the DVD is pretty good except for the lack of commentary.  The ""extra film"" they advertise is actually deleted scenes cleverly spliced next to key scenes from the feature to make a little ""mini-Ring"" synopsis film, including what was obviously the original ending (and should have been kept as such, in my opinion).  No fear, I'm sure in 2 years they will release a big special edition DVD and put all the goodies on it, making this one obsolete.",1047427200,,1600,4.689285714285714

1407385,5,B000059HCH,"First of all, I would like to point out that not since The Blair Witch Project, did a film divide reviewers the way the Ring did..either top or low marks, which in my opinion is due to the film's success..it makes people react and think about it. I sure did.
The hype surrounding the film notwithstanding, I really watched it with a clear objective eye, and I was very much impressed by what I saw. Being sick and tired with the usual horror movies formula of blood and gore and predictable endings, The Ring provided a fresh alternative, boosted by a very good script, haunting piano and strings score, talented director and excellent acting.
I would put the Ring along with The Blair Witch, and the Others as the most intelligent horror movie I have seen since The Omen/Excorist period!! and indeed it is an horror film, despite some reviewers thinking otherwise, for the subject, the tension and the supernatural element makes it so.
Speaking of the tension, it is there form the first minute, when the two teenage girls are talking about the deadly tape and the inevitable consequence that sets the mood. The tension did remind me of the Blair Witch, gradually building by each passing day..The similarities with the Blair Witch probably stems from the fact that both film are the brainchild of talented amateur filmmakers on small budgets (I am talking about The Japanese original 'Ringu', which the Ring is 'inspired from' though I have yet to see it to judge whether it was copied frame by frame from the original like many hollywood adaptations (Assasins, Birdcage..etc..) or loosley based on as the filmmakers claim..)
Both films have a supernatural edge and an ending that far from giving an answer, deepens the mystery.
Like The Omen and The Exorcist, the use the innocence of a child as a vehicle for evil is part of why The Ring works well..
The 'evil' tape in question is very well filmed and edited and is truly spooky, especially since we see it at the begining..
Yet there are some flaws in the The Ring..The role of the child is under developed, and not as prominent as it is in the Sixth Sense..and some aspect of the plot just does not make any sense..but overall, I give it full marks, because it is an intelligent horror film, that will keep you at the edge of your seat, and because we really need similar films more often.",1047427200,,2346,4.641826923076923
1407386,1,B000059HCH,"I have never really liked horror movies much, and so I sat here at the computer, wonderered if I should give a review to this movie, fearful that I might have been intrinsically biased to give it a bad review.  Well, after setting my qualms about horror aside, I'm giving it a bad review anyway.
I knew this movie was going to be a bad one from the first snippets of dialogue: two teenage girls talking about Your Most Basic Outcast Teenager Stuff, and then the small talk is eschewed in the clunkiest manner possible when one suddenly tells the other about a videotape that kills the viewer one week after he/she watches it.  Ugh.  And uh-oh, one of the girls watched it seven days ago.  She dies, and her friend ends up in an psychiatric ward.
Enter the heroine, an investigative reporter for a Seattle newspaper, played by Naomi Watts.  She's the aunt of the opening scene's victim.  She comes across the tape and watches it, and learns that she has seven days left.
This part was actually intriguing to me, because I thought the movie was going to break free of the horror movie cliches it was in danger of getting bogged down into.  At this point it's more of a thriller; a race against time.  Title cards coveniently fade in, reminding us how long she has before she dies.  To add to the excitment, her son watches the tape--now she's not just fighting for her own life but his, too.
The biggest problem with the movie was that it almost seemed to want to be another ""Sixth Sense"" by providing a twist and then giving a back story after the fact saying ""See, here's why there's a twist and why the movie doesn't end the way you think it does.""  There is even a review on the box of the DVD stating that it is the best scary movie since ""The Sixth Sense"".  Nice try, but this movie isn't a tenth of what that one is.
The twist itself wasn't the problem--in fact, I kind of liked it and thought that after it was established that yes, this was the way things were REALLY going to work out, the movie would have ended on a stronger note without any explanation.  Instead, as before mentioned, more scenes take place that might interest some people who like all their stories tied up with a bow, but just left me thinking ""This movie's STILL not over?""",1047340800,,2254,4.391826923076923

I think it is completley uproarious when people think that a PG-13 film will possess chills down the spine. I thought this movie was loaded with alot of cheap scares and I think the suspense was the only factor in this film that possesed any scary moments. The plot was very unexplained and didn't really make alot of sense. Also anything that they felt they could build any suspense off of they did it. For example why was it so important to not explain that Naomi Watts friend was the father of her child? The plot is so thin that they take little things like that to keep you going and it turns out to be insignificant. Why was Samara evil? Why did she enjoy what she was doing? How did she have the power to proceed with these actions after death? I suppose the tape was basically a channel or outsource for her to pick and get to her victims? I really don't understand it was a really strange idea to be conceived. But I will say that I like the direction of the film and the hazy cinematography that it conveyed. Which definitley gave it that erie boast to help support its plot. Basically though I think I am a bit more supportive of this film because Naomi Watts is in it. Every since 2001's Mulholland Dr, I have been somewhat of a fan of her work. But anyway I am not going to ramble on about this film. If you are one of those that will easily get scared this is the project for you other wise just enjoy the suspense of this film and the visuals. I don't really know alot about the japanese Ringu, but it has to be more violent than this film I will definitley have to check it out.

1407388,5,B000059HCH,This movie was scary! I was really freaked out! On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it an 11.,1047340800,,94,3.3181818181818183
1407389,3,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is best viewed for its subconsciously affecting elements.  Anytime the film strays into an area where logic is required, it falters.  But the chills which it provides are quite intense, if you'll let them be.
The film's plot, which need not be summarized here in great detail since others have done it before and better, concerns a videotape which kills its viewers in seven days.  Our heroine is a journalist trying to keep the tape from killing herself and her son.  Now, the first truly frightening part of this film is that killer videotape itself.  Using a mixture of elements lifted from Freudian psychology and inserted into frightening settings, it is quite disturbing in a way that is hard to pin down.  What, exactly, is so sinister about a ladder leaning against a blank wall?  Or a woman slowly brushing her hair?  Somehow these mundane elements become subtly chilling.  Stylistically the video resembles Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" but uses such a surreal effect to much more disturbing ends.  Whereas Bunuel's film was just calculated weirdness, the killer videotape might stay with you when you try to fall asleep at night after seeing this film.
The other disturbing elements play on subconscious fears that many viewers are probably not aware that they have.  For example, in modern society it is very easy to go a lifetime without confronting the terrifying situations of being trapped in a well or chased by a maverick horse.  But once we see these situations, we respond with a primal terror.  It is in visceral thrills like these that ""The Ring"" excels.
Its logical abilities are somewhat more impaired.  The film spends too much time trying to tie up loose ends, but in the process points our attention to the questions that are left unanswered.  Many classic horror movies explain themselves away in the end, but they do so fully, in a way that makes the audience say, ""Ah!  I understand why that happened now!""  ""The Ring"" simply leaves us saying, ""Okay, so that's why THAT happened, but what about THIS?  How can THIS be explained?""  The strengths of this film lie in its visual effects (the villainess is truly creepy, when she finally appears).  I suggest taking the film at face value, renting it for a teenage slumber party, or renting it for a night at home with a date.  Perhaps a little wine or other intoxicant would eliminate some of the glaring plot holes for some viewers.
Regarding the DVD features, there are not too many.  But the deleted scenes montage is quite well-done.  Gore Verbinksi has taken deleted scenes and intercut them with necessary moments from the finished film, creating a ""shortened"" version of the original film that uses the deleted scenes in place of transitional scenes that made the final cut.  I feel that some of the scenes which made the final cut could have been left out in favor of some deleted scenes which enriched the background story, but that is my opinion.  At any rate, the deleted scenes are worth checking out.  The preview for the Japanese original version of the film make it seem exactly like the American version, which I'm sure it isn't really.  But it does give you an idea of what the Japanese version looks like.  Overall, watch the film and the bonus features once.  Let it scare the pants off you.  Then postpone watching it again for a while, lest the inevitable questions of logic begin to creep in.",1047340800,2,3400,4.762393162393162
1407390,3,B000059HCH,"Let me start by saying that I did not see the 1998 Japanese cult horror flick, RINGU, from which this film was re-made. That's a different film from a different country: get over it. This movie is very scary, extremely well-crafted, but ultimately something of a mess. It was also my distinct impression that this is a film most effective on the big screen (I did not see it in the theaters).
For those of you who saw the abysmal FEARDOTCOM, this movie is really the same idea right down to the creepy little dead girl who can't seem to stay dead; instead of a website that kills you in a week, it's a videotape. Can you make that adjustment, people? However, THE RING is a much better film, although amusingly enough, fails ultimately for the same reasons.
The best part about THE RING is its dynamic cinematography, brooding atmosphere, and unsettling mood. It is superbly shot: The movie looks and feels like you're viewing it through an aquarium after midnight. It is always raining in this mis-en-scene, and that coupled with its smoky, steely, lonely backdrops made me realize, once again, how strangely influential the Brad Pitt classic, SE7EN, has been on these types of films. Another major plus: the attractive, straight-from-the-outback leads do solid work. Naomi Watts is lovely, and screams better than any horror heroine I've seen in quite some time. The excellent character actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also turn up here, breathing some more life into all this creepiness.
THE RING does extremely well with fractured, nightmarish dreamscapes, bold startling images that burn themselves on your retina. In this way, THE RING references the little known but actually pretty scary Robert Downey, Jr.-Annette Bening supernatural caper, IN DREAMS, and the visual artist Joel Peter Witkin, who inspired all those NINE INCH NAILS videos. The movie is genuinely frightening without resorting to much violence or gore. It maintains its tension throughout, and in this way is similar to both SIGNS and the MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, both of which are better films. It also has an unexplainably deadpan little boy who looks prophetic and miserable, babbles precocious nonsense, and in this way references THE SIXTH SENSE. The movie also begins with an unsettling, un-ironic prologue that gives you really no idea where this movie is headed. This prologue doesn't even apologize for imitating SCREAM.
There are some truly stunning sequences: the escaped horse on the ferry, the ghostly searching of that lighthouse in the abandoned farmhouse, poor Naomi trapped in that well, but ultimately this horror-mystery-art film goes nowhere. It is scary, fun to watch, builds momentum, but makes no sense at the end, so in this way pays tribute to the most talked about cult horror-mystery film of late, DONNIE DARKO.
I was truly disappointed, ultimately. THE RING was doing so well for me, but one false ending later it had left too many unanswered questions (i.e. for those of you who have seen this: how DID ole Anna Morgan conceive her devil child?), loose ends (what's the source of creepy little boy's psychic link to creepy little girl?), and some terrible TERRIBLE plot holes, which makes everything you've just seen lose credibility. So instead of a glossy horror-mystery-art film, you'll realize all you've been watching all along is a BAD MTV VIDEO.
One further note: the DVD isn't exactly jam-packed with extras. It's structured well, looks great naturally, and has a clever set-up for the deleted scenes. But, like the film, could have tried harder to do more.",1047340800,,3568,5.018549747048904
1407391,1,B000059HCH,This has to be one of the worst movies I ever wasted time watching. Then I watched RINGU just as dumb. Did people forget how to make a good scary movie?,1047340800,,152,3.935483870967742
1407392,5,B000059HCH,"Firstly, I wish to refute the claim that many are making that ""The Ring"" is not a horror film; horror doesn't necessarily mean dripping gore and vampires.  ""The Ring"" is a story about supernatural evil, therefore, it IS a horror film, done very much in the style of the ""psycological thriller.""
I'm a horror fan, no question; books, film, even video games.  I've even managed to publish a few of my own horror short stories.  Therefore, I'm rather jaded, but ""The Ring"" did frighten me.  However, this doesn't mean that it will scare everyone, but, then, just because it doesn't scare you doesn't mean that the film is inherintly unfrightening.  Horror is a bit like comedy, either it works for you, (by making you laugh, or scaring you, depending on which genre we are talking about,) or it doesn't.  It varies from person to person, simple as that.  What scares me might not scare you and vice versa.
Perhaps what I thought was greatest about ""The Ring"" was that it seemed to strike a perfect balance between coherence and ambiguity, as well as onscreen and offscreen visuals.  Going too far either way can completely ruin a horror film.  For example, ""The Blair Witch Project"" lauded for making one ""use his/her imagination,"" was FAR too vague.  You have to show the viewer SOMETHING, just not necessarily everything.
The ending, (which, admittedly, dragged a bit,) explains enough but also leaves the viewer with a little bit to discuss and ponder.  I loved that, while watching the film in the theater, I, at first, thought that it would that certain cliched ending that we've seen a million times, but that it then went off in another direction.
I'll say this much, as for my own interpretations, without giving the end away:  As for Samora's origins, the phrase which pops up in the film, ""some things just aren't meant to be,"" I feel, is most telling.  Samora's mother REALLY wanted a child, but, since God wouldn't give her one...
This film was vastly underrated by the jaded, out-of-touch critics.",1047340800,,2007,4.782608695652174
1407393,4,B000059HCH,"ok some folks, may not have liked the movie, when it first came out, some others may have, me?  Scared the heck out of me (it also scared all the grown men in the theater when I saw it, they were screaming like little kids!) You see to me the best thing to do in making a movie is leaving it to the viewers own mind as how the person is killed, or made insane.
This movie scared me for several days, then on top of all that my mother programed the vcr and cable wrong one day, so that the cable turned on one night at 3 am!! (ok if you have seen the movie you know what i am thinking!!) I laughed about it later in the daylight, but that night, It terrified me....",1047340800,,664,3.8823529411764706
1407394,3,B000059HCH,"First of all, let's go over what's right with this movie. The scary parts are actually scary. You do jump. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time that has actually scared me. The first time I saw it in the theater, I was on the edge of my seat and felt jittery when the movie got tense. That's a good thing.
What's wrong with the movie? To start, the acting. Naomi Watts has got to be one of my least favorite actresses, and she's just not that convincing in this roll. Also, the omniscient little kid has been way overdone since Sixth Sense. He was totally unneeded, and a bad child actor at that.
The realism needs some working on as well. Now, I know it's a horror movie and some facets of reality need to be suspended, but there are some things that are inexcusable. At one point, Rachel is running around furiously trying to get ready for a wake, and her son is calmly finishing up, tying his tie. This kid couldn't have been older than six, and he can tie a tie? I'm 21 and still have trouble with that.
I also saw no point in doing anything with a relationship between Rachel and Noah. It was pointless and had nothing to do with the story. Maybe they should have spent less time with building up that the kid was theirs and more time explaining how in world Samara got her supernatural powers. And why a videotape?
The bottom line, however, is that if you're a film student, you probably won't like this movie. If you're just looking for a few scares or something to watch to make your girlfriend cuddle up a little closer to you, this is it. Like I said, it was the first movie in a long time to actually spook me...",1047254400,,1635,4.226837060702875

The film works a high-concept urban legend: A VHS cassette brings death to those unlucky enough to view its stream of bizarre images. The remake of Japan's ""Ringu"" stars Naomi Watts as a newspaper reporter caught up in the mystery of the tape
""Ring"" director Gore Verbinski channeled Bunuel and nine inch nails for his version of the video snuff film, creating a compelling film within a film. The fun continues on the ""Ring"" DVD, with a new Verbinski short that's accessed by clicking on the link ""Don't watch this."" (Verbinski knows his shorts -- he created the Budweiser frogs.)
The 15-minute film unveils a few more clues about the sinister tape, including its last-known location. (Hint: Late fees most likely won't be collected.) Those who care will have fun slowing the blitz of images with their DVD remotes to reveal even more clues or red herrings. A handful of ""Ring"" outtakes get burned off along the way, not always gracefully.
DreamWorks says Verbinski chose not to include the usual making-of extras in order to preserve the mystery of ""The Ring."" The DVD of the original has a trailer for the remake, and vice versa. Universal, as usual, slips in trailers for its current boxoffice fare on both discs.
""The Ring"" looks great, handling with equal aplomb the grim black-and-white and the visual relief of rich fall colors. Aspect ratio for the widescreen version is 1.85:1; full frame also is offered. The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio tracks are oddly tame, biased toward the front channels.",1047254400,,1694,4.905923344947735

There are still quite a few things that i don't understand, but each time i watch it, one more thing that i didn't understand before makes sense.  As I look back, they make this movie so scary, and there is almost NO blood in this movie what-so-ever...except for a couple nose bleeds here and there, and a couple other little things, besides that, there is no blood.  And the silence in this movie is one of the things that gets you.  There isn't a whole lot of background sound, but some....and the little they do have, chills you to the bone.  All the little things in it that remind you of stuff you've seen before in the movie are very clever, and unique.  This movie was very well put together, and i think it deserves a ten out of ten!

I'll be buying it tomorrow. The plot at first seems silly, like the whole, candyman,candyman,candyman...you know what I'm getting at. But as the story unfolds, the silliness quickly melts away and the creep factor kicks in with full force. The performances of the cast are excellent and the movie is visually stunning. The lead charachter is Rachel, a cocksure reporter who's niece recently died under very strange circumstances. Rachel decides to investigate an urban legend about a video tape that kills its viewers (event horizon?) and quickly falls under the curse. Although Rachel has dug herself into a gigantic hole, she just can't put the shovel down and drags all sorts of people into it with her. This movie is not a hack and slash bloodfest, but a creepfest, full of atmosphere.

1407405,4,B000059HCH,"Gore Verbinski's classy remake of the 1998 Japanese film Ringu packs quite a few chills, thrills and a few spills into a solid creepfest. Verbinski's previous films (Mouse Hunt and The Mexican) demonstrated his skill as a film director but nothing hinted at his ability to handle this film. I've noticed quite a few comments about how confusing the film's conclusion seems. There's always unanswered questions in the best thrillers (Kubrick's much maligned The Shining or Freidkin's The Exorcist are two good examples). Verbinski and his American collaborators focus on a what appears to be a streamlined narrative but really had more twists and turns than is at first hinted at.
The plot has been well summarized already but for the sake of this review I'll provide a thumbnail sketch; There's a video floating out there that, urban legend has it, will kill you 7 days after you've watched it. A reporter's niece is dies horribly after having accidently watched it with some friends (all of her friends died as well). She decides to investigate and watches it herself in the process. After watching it she, like all the victims, gets a call from a little girl that tells her she has 7 days to live. The timeframe and tragedy associated with the video spurs her on to find out who is behind the video and why innocents are dying. In the process, she unwittingly opens up a supernatural pandora's box.
The jumpy editing, spooky cinematography and strong performances all enhance the film making it almost a sequel to the original Japanese classic. Since most sequels are remakes trying to recapture lightening anyway, Verbinski works in visual references to both the original film and other classic horror films in an attempt to make this more than your standardized American remake of a sucessful foreign film.
.... The Ring is an intelligent, forceful thriller that doesn't overload us with gore. Instead, it focuses on the ""suspense"" angle. We, as the audience, know what's going to happen to some extend. Verbinski and the writer on the film use that knowledge to their advantage. There are a number of fleeting graphic images but nothing over the top. Additionally, the story of estrangement at the core of the film plays off of the story that the reporter begins unraveling about the videotape.
There are a number of unexpected twists and turns along the way (don't let anybody tell you anything beyond the plot description)that remind us what good films ""terror films"" (as Boris Karloff called them) are all about.
The extras include a number of trailers including the trailer for Catch Me If You Can, Ringu and a short ""film"" by the director that provides additional clues as to the heart of the mystery. The director wisely chose not to go with a DVD packed with extras recognizing that the mystery at the core of the film would be dispersed with too much information.",1047168000,,2876,4.871428571428571
1407406,5,B000059HCH,"The Ring, the movie that has scared almost everyone who has seen it. The same effect was not put upon me, but it was definitely thought provoking and I left the theater with the creepiest feeling.

 The plot is known by mostly anyone, and it's known that The Ring is a remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu. Gore Verbinski's direction was very effective. Had to be to scare the daylights out of everyone. His use of mixing subtle blues and blacks fit the films mood, and enhanced my mood while watching it. Naomi Watts succeeds at her character for I was involved thoroughly with it throughout the entire movie. Martin Henderson also pulls through as the side character. The subplot dealing with his and Watts' character was effective. And David Dorfman who played Aidan, the little kid, was quite creepy. His eyes did a lot of the acting. Great performance.

 The DVD release is a bit of a letdown. It's near barebones with only one feature and a string of 3 trailers (Although one is for Ringu). The one feature - the new short film that was much hyped - is a combination of deleted scenes mixed in with the actual video tape. It's a good watch, but doesn't reveal anything new. I'd rather have seen the deleted scenes in the normal format. But hey, where is the theatrical trailer for The Ring itself?!
 After the major success The Ring has had in just its first day of sales (2 million copies in 24 hours), a special edition is expected. Because, hey! More show, more money making. But I'll be there to buy it.

1407407,5,B000059HCH,"I haven't seen a horror movie that impressed me this way since The Blair Witch. It was completely non-linear, which is what good movie making should be all about. The background story involves the little girl, Samara, who came about possibly by unnatural means. She has the ability to thought-project dark hallucinatory images, causing madness of an infectious scale. For a while, the girl is left in the care of an institution, where she is carefully studied, and her thought projections captured in negative print. Scattered images of Samara being monitored, even then a ghostly little girl with long dark hair hanging over eyes that look like swelled black pupils without irises. But eventually Samara is murdered, dropped into a well, and her abilities become demonic. Her residual imprint is captured in technology, her thoughts projected onto a simple video tape that provides her with a gateway into this world. If you watch the tape, taking in the nightmare images, forming the link, you die in seven days.
One thing that seems almost unsettling is the fact that Samara was, in life, a beautiful kid, despite the things that lurked behind her pale doll's face. She renters this world as a vengeful wraith, with real, physical power, and with her other abilities amplied. By opening the gateway, via the video tape, Samara is able to seek out her victims and just turn them into ruin. When they find the victims later, they're shriveled, drained, ash-grey, with eyes filmed like milk, and horrified expressions that twist their faces into hideous masks. It's cool. The best part is that you never see the actual deaths, just the aftermath. It's a shadowy playground for the imagination, unlike with Fear Dot Com, which was an okay movie but made the mistake by showing you everything.
I've heard this movie get maligned a little, but don't listen to any of it. This movie rules. The DVD itself has a short film that contains existing movie footage interspersed with deleted scenes, proving a little bit more in the way of background. (Actually I think it would have been even better if they had left those deleted scenes in.) There's also a trailer for the Japanese movie, Ringu, which The Ring was based upon. Haven't gotten a chance to see that one yet, but I want to, and I want to read the novel when it's released.

Knowing that the plot concerns a videotape that kills you a week after watching it, I expected this film to be something like ""Final Destination"".  How wrong I was.  From a somewhat typical horror movie opening scene, ""The Ring"" develops into a well-crafted horror/mystery that is never obvious, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, the truly surprising finish makes you reevaluate everything that has come before.  The few plot points that are not explained or left vague only contribute to the strength and enigmatic quality of the movie.  The fact that the filmakers were able to make a film this effective and maintain a PG-13 rating is a testament to how little blood and gore add to a truly frightening movie.  I know that it's the ultimate in cultural snobbery when successful foreign films are remade for an American audience, but I feel that ""The Ring"" is much more effective than ""Ringu"", it's Japanese inspiration.  My only possible complaint is the lack of much bonus material on the DVD, but on the other hand, a movie like this is better taken at face value without alot of bells and whistles.

1407420,5,B000059HCH,"This is defiently a must see movie! This is one of the most scarriest movies, since the ""Sixth Sense"". Sixth Sense had nothing on ""The Ring""! The Ring is a very scary movie, which should be taken seriously, as it COULD be a real case. Many people know about this movie, thats why Im not gonna go into detail much. But I saw some disturbing images, and when I mean disturbing I mean 'Disturbing'! I have jumped out of my seat more than twice watching the film. But, maybe.. Just maybe, this movie can teach us about real life. I mean, maybe there is such a video that later in life can determine how long we live. And maybe there are little phsychopathic Children in wells, haunting others. This may be true, but It not might not. It makes chills run up your spine just to think that by watching a video, a person can call you and tell you, you have only 7 more days to live! This video was very disturbing, along with the Littel girl. She was most frighting! I recomend this video for ages 13+. The images are too disturbing for a younger audience. This movie is a ride that will take you to the edge of your seat! From watching this movie, many people will now tell you that they will keep away from wells and not watch any strange videos that other people may find. From now on, I will keep away from wells, little girls with Extremly long, brown, hair and Strange video footage found in another place.",1046995200,,1404,4.30188679245283
1407421,5,B000059HCH,"It's the small things that always have scared me most. An unexplained movement within the shadows. A vague face peering in the window at me from the blackness. Always the subtle, always the implied. The paranoia of the unseen and the unknown. The Ring is an exercize in implication, in the imagined, in the string of terrible coincidences that make something so astronomically improbable horribly true. Its very much like a nightmare, an altered sense of consciousness.
Is is disjointed? Yes. Nightmares don't make complete sense, but they're still frightening. They progress on suggestion; when you think something horrible is going to happen, no matter how improbable, it happens. And, it isn't even as if The Ring's plot is illogical. One can see how things move from one point to the next; at worst, one might call the plotting convenient (eg. she just HAPPENS to open the right notebook in which there HAPPENS to be the claim-ticket for CERTAIN photographs that lead to the next clue/scene). I just went with the flow, and it didn't bother me.
As for questions the movie doesn't answer ... I don't know what questions those might be. It made sense to me. The whys and wherefores weren't overtly stated, but I was able to surmise what had happened in the past, what was happening, and why. How can a video [end life]? Trying not to spoil anything, I must point out that videotape is only a medium. Medium: a conduit through which something passes. For instance, people who supposedly channel spirits are called mediums, right? This is, after all, a SUPERNATURAL horror story, and there are similar myths of curses taking the form of symbols, icons, and other writings and drawings; you read it or examine it too long, and you get the whammy. Me, I like stories about ghosts and psychic abilities and stuff. It's a matter of personal tastes.
My only complaint is for the DVD. There's only the movie itself and a side entry with some tarted-up scenes that hadn't made the original cut. I'd recommend waiting for a special edition to be released before buying. But, in all, a veeeeery creepy movie. Much more chilling than The Sixth Sense because there is a definite prevalent malice that The Sixth Sense lacked.",1046995200,,2213,4.811023622047244
1407422,3,B000059HCH,"Having not been fortunate enough to have seen the original Japanese film (or its sequel) I'm probably not as qualified as others to give an accurate rating of THE RING, but I found the movie to be reasonably good. Basically this centres around a videotape which results in viewers dying bloody deaths after watching it.  (No, its not THE SOUND OF MUSIC).
Anyhow this tape falls into the hands of a young couple whose lives are turned upside down, especially after their son views it.
THE RING has a few good ideas, some gross FX, a reasonably entertaining and twisty storyline  and a few chills. It's a decent way to kill a couple of hours but after a while THE RING becomes a bit tiresome.

The only drawback to the movie is the reporter's psychic, monotone son who seems to be based on a collage of previous horror flick children ala The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echos.

1407425,5,B000059HCH,"Before you die, you see the ring. Or, at least that's what the urban legend says in ""The Ring"" - the movie deemed ""the scariest movie of the year"". I say it is the best film of the year, of any genre. It was the only movie I saw from 2002 that kept my whole interest up until the very end; the only one where I couldn't wait to see what happened next; the only one that freaked me out so much, it actually accelerated my heartbeat in a few of the scenes.
Some people say it wasn't scary at all, but these are probably the people who love all of those slasher films like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"". ""The Ring"" is not a slasher film; it kind of follows the same formula as ""Final Destination"", where people start dying, but nobody really knows why. There is not a lot of gore, nor is there really any good action sequences. It's a psychological thriller all of the way. And such a great one that it sticks in your mind long after it's over. Naomi Watts plays Rachel, a reporter who is investigating the death of her niece - whose demise seems to have something to do with the mysterious tape she and three of her friends watched seven days before they all died. According to the urban legend, anyone who watches this tape receives a phone call afterwards, and a voice on the other end says ""Seven days..."" And seven days later, you die. We see the tape - it's a very short film that is actually a bunch of strange snippets of different things: a ladder, a tree burning, a mysterious woman brushing her hair in the mirror, and a few other weird things. The whole tape plays out like a silent music video, and it's creepy heck. Just the scenes where anyone is watching the tape is creepy enough.
If you like scary movies, you must see this one. And if you like it, you must own it. The only thing about this film that bothered me was that it left me with many unanswered questions. If you've seen it, you may know what I'm talking about. But maybe it just takes a couple of viewings for everything to click. I'm sure the film has its flaws (I noticed a few myself), but it will send chills down your spine - I know it did mine. And I rarely get spooked at movies. I deem it as the most original film of the year (even though it is a remake of the foreign film ""Ringu""), and the best film of the year, hands down. I hope I see more films like this in 2003.",1046908800,,2358,4.161925601750547

This film does a lot of scaring without resorting to gaping neck wounds and gallons of blood.  And it has an interesting story line.  The director uses imagery, colors, and builds the tension in a way that draws the viewer in and fills you with dread for the lead character played by Naomi Watts.  This is a great horror film to add to your collection.  The dvd comes with extras that are interesting too.  Give this movie a try and you won't be disappointed.",1046908800,,655,4.319672131147541
1407428,5,B000059HCH,"I've been a fan of horror movies since I can remember. As a young kid, I tried to find a movie that would truly scare me, and I never did. The first Halloween movie was the best I came across. The Exorcist did nothing for me.
Then I saw the previews for this movie. I thought it looked sort of lame but also intriguing. So I went to see it with a friend. It was the best movie-going experience I've had yet, and the only time I've been genuinely terrified by a movie.
I don't know what it is about this movie -- the acting, the cinematography, and the storyline are all superb, but it's impossible to put my finger on the reason it scared me so much. And that's what I love about it. There's something intangible in the film's atmosphere that gave me the chills. I unplugged my TV for two weeks after just to be safe (yes, I'm lame).
Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses out there today -- she made a huge impression on me with her great performance in David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE, and she definitely didn't let me down here. She's perfect for the role and she pulls it off beautifully, looking more and more tense as the plot thickens.
The villain of the movie, Samara, was portrayed by Daveigh Chase, and I can say with certainty that for a little girl, she sure knows how to be scary. I liked her a lot more than RINGU's villain, Sadako.
Speaking of RINGU, if you're thinking of passing this one up to see the original, my advice is this: don't. Perhaps I'm one of those people who the ""true horror fans"" call unenlightened, but the Japanese version, in my opinion, is far inferior to this one. After seeing the American version, I read about the original and downloaded it, expecting to be floored by it and to prefer it highly over the remake. But it lacked suspense for me, and at points it became too ridiculous to give any credibility to.
However, judging by the reviews on here and the ones I've read elsewhere, I'm missing something. It bothers me to know that I'm not getting the full experience, but there is something about RINGU that must have escaped me. Maybe I'll watch it again some time.
Anyway, yes, there are some plot holes. To me, they're so minor that I didn't give them a second thought. But they do seem to bother some other people, so if you like having everything explained to you, you may be disappointed here.
To finish this highly rambling review, I will say that if you're like me, you will be extremely pleased by and scared by this movie. Don't pass it up just because it may be less ""artsy"" than the original.",1046908800,,2554,4.367647058823529

1407430,4,B000059HCH,"The Ring is one of those highly entertaining films you don't want to get too high and mighty over to enjoy. Sure I suppose the ""Original"" is better (I haven't seen it but isn't that what they always say?). The storyline requires a level of suspension of logic on the order of ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lau"". It girates along rather like a clothes washer with a bad foot. There are three or four major sections that hang together OK. Just jerky enough to jostle you but seamless enough to keep the spell going. What recommends this film most is that it is entertaining and engaging. It starts ouit with the usual couple of mildly bad school girls clad in uniforms. Immediatly you start to think ""Oh Jeez they're still making these films!"". But the photography is dark and realistic and the girls are oh so cute so... Then the hook stuff happens and you go ""I didn't get that."" That's where the movie gets you. The fun is trying to figure out what comes next. The ""Killer Video"" is disturbing in it's imagery, full-on creepy really. Like that scene in Le Chien Andalu where the eyeball gets sliced. The director shows some humor and even pays tribute to Hitch with the scene in the shower where the beautiful Naomi Watts is washing off the blood and the camera pans to the drain. OK, so it's been overdone. It's only a movie! She obviously carries the film along. With her striking yet approachably delicate beauty that isn't threatening to other women she projects a kooky, spunky lost protagonist. The supporting actors are all in good form. Where'd they get the kid? Those eyes! Anyway the creepy stuff gets you where it should, right in the entrails without resorting to overt, non-creepy bloodbaths and stock tension build ups. Enjoy!

1407432,3,B000059HCH,"Once I got past the idea that I was expected to be terrified in watching The Ring, I began to enjoy myself a whole lot more.
I think it was a mistake to try to market this film as horror.  The awareness that it takes seven days for you to die after watching the tape only means there isn't ever much physical danger -- you know the character would make it until the last day arrives.  The PG-13 rating, ensuring that the mayhem and shock imagery would be somewhat tamed, didn't help.  And there's the somewhat goofy premise.  That such a fuss was made of a VHS tape (right down to references its timecode) is a real stretch.
But once I figured out that The Ring isn't really a horror film, I was able to accept it much more on its own terms.  Naomi Watts deserves all the accolades she got for holding this film together.  The woman has never given a bad or even mediocre performance in her career, and her turn in The Ring reminds me of her last foray into horror -- Children of the Corn IV.  Believe it or not, that was a fantastic acting turn, and Watts gives The Ring the same grace, sympathy and emotional commitment that has made her great.  She has a special knack for layering every emotional moment with precisely its opposite spectrum -- moments of anger turn into sorrow; fear is tinged with joy and strength; and given the somewhat weak supporting cast, Watts is the only reason you care about any of the other characters at all.
Though I nearly laughed out loud at the ludicrous first scene of the film, again, once I figured out that this isn't truly a horror film, Ehren Kruger's script began to look like a pretty good job.  The lines are crisper and better thought out than in modern horror brethren like FearDotCom, and the visual and story setups and payoffs are quite satisfying.
I haven't seen the Japanese original so I can't draw any comparison.  However, I think The Ring is at worst a slightly spooky, beautifully shot time-passer, and at its best, it is a pretty good mythical drama which showcases a brilliant actress, who is finally getting the attention she deserves.",1046822400,7,2096,4.4776902887139105

1407434,5,B000059HCH,"I want to start out by saying I'm not easily scared. There are only a few movies that have had me peeking through my fingers as I watched it. ""The Ring"" is one of them. You probably already know the plot, so I'll just tell you what the actual movie is like.  Every scene seems to be important or have some frightening part. Even though the discussion at the beginning of the movie isn't even supposed to be scary (about television waves), I already had the creeps. Know why? It was too quiet. There wasn't any background music, there wasn't ANYTHING. Just two teenage girls talking to each other. You never know when something's going to jump out at you. This movie seems to really take advantage of that. Practically the whole movie is quiet in the background. When there is music, it sends chills down your spine. During ""THE TAPE"", my cousin claimed to have heard ""Cha-ching"" noises in the background. I've yet to heard this, but I believe him. Everytime you see this film, you notice something new. A lot of the things you notice will scare the heck out of you, too. There are ""rings"" in a lot of scenes, for instance, when Noah picks up his coffee cup, there is a ring left on the table. I haven't seen the original movie called ""Ringu"", but maybe it's better that I saw this one first. While a lot of movies (Scream, I know what you did last summer) seem to think that violence equals scary, ""The Ring"" takes a different path. It scares you psychologically with smart images, a unique story, and terrifying scenes. There's hardly any violence, actually. When I think of this movie, I remember myself huddling down in my theatre seat and closing my eyes. Yet, I never wanted to leave. It's great movie, that's just on the brink of comfortable scary, and a little too scary. It terrified me and everyone I saw it with. But we LOVED it! This movie somehow targets what scares you most and intensifies it for 2 hours. My cousin and I talked about it after we saw it for about an hour. It sticks with you. The last time I saw it was October, and I still think about it! See this movie, if you dare.",1046822400,11,2099,4.395886889460154

It had a well thought out plot, many great twists, and a FANTASTIC ending of which you could have never guessed!

1407436,5,B000059HCH,"Alright, everyone has heard mixed reviews from critics and other sources about this movie, so now I am going to tell you the truth. This movie has got to be the scariest movie made in the last ten years. In my oppinion, it ranks higher than ""The Sixth sense"" and ""The Others"".
It scared the bejesus out of me and I am NEVER scared of movies. I mean I laughed at the ""Blair Witch"" and cried at ""Signs""
Now there are some confusing parts. For example, I'm sure everyone would love to know the history and where the mysterious tape was made, but it won't give much on that. And the ending needs a little work. I won't give it away, but it could have been better.
There is minimal violence, no nudity and hardly any swearing. Although you will see a couple of very disturbing scenes.
The Ring is so much better in the terms of you won't see one beheading or a beating heart in the two hours that this movie takes to watch.
I think the plot was very orginal. When Rachel, (Naomi Watts) a reporter, starts to investigate the murder of her niece, she starts unraveling more than she could ever imagine. She finds and watches a mysterious video tape that will bring about your demise exactly seven days later. She then inlists the help of an old boyfriend Noah,( Bryan Cox) who watches the tape and the two are then put in the middle of a mind boggling mystery.
I just loved Naomi Watts in this movie. I belive she has a big future in Hollowood. I also thought Bryan Cox was great in his performance. They have great chemistry in the movie and I can't wait to see more from the both of them.
But like I said earlier their are a couple of plot holes, but I think were put there for a reason, so maybe they will be explained in a sequel. (wink wink). So  go spend the four bucks and rent it or the 18 bucks and buy the dvd. I think it will be well worth it! That is the truth about this dvd. It's not perfect, but any real movie lover will love this movie!

1407437,3,B000059HCH,"I'm not a fan of horror movies because they simply don't scare me. I jump at the the occasional spring-loaded cat (like the one in MINORITY REPORT), but efforts to make me quiver in my seat and sleep with the lights on never seem to work for me. Along comes THE RING, Hollywood's insidious effort to get me to label my videotapes.
The movie's very well made. The effort is there to make a really creepy film, and the material the film is built on is suitably freaky. It's a bit unfortunate that the vastly inferior FEARDOTCOM pilfered so blatantly from the original story--the twisted plot would have been a lot more impressive if the key parts of it hadn't been paraded past us just a few months ago.
As for THE RING, the visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is excellent, but when you try to add it all up, you end up with more questions than answers, and pretty pedestrian questions, at that. Put as many twists, turns and shocks into a movie as you like--you still have to pay off what you set up.
Maybe this is a ""more to the story than meets the eye"" situation, or maybe it's a story where questions and hints are meant to be taken as absolute fact. Either way, the information you need in order to understand what's going on is practically invisible, here. It's not hard to tell what happens, but the average viewer comes away with way too many questions about WHY it happens.
I do appreciate the clever approach to presenting deleted scenes in this one: make it a separate film that feels like story moments we didn't see in the original, tied together with a similar feel and enough of the main story for us to understand where the scenes would have appeared if they hadn't been cut from the film. The deleted scenes feel as creepy and suspensful as the original, as well as offering a few nice pointed observations from the townsfolk to fill in a bit of the Morgans' story.
Is it scary? I'm the wrong person to ask. Is it entertaining? Yeah, I think so. Much better than the average Hollow-wood ""churn 'em out"" horror film. Does it make sense? Depends who you ask. People steeped in the background of Suzuki's original novels or the Japanese version of the story (RINGU) probably have a much better idea what's going on in this thing than the rest of us do.",1046822400,2,2267,4.451923076923077

To me, this says that people are so jaded by the majority of [stuff] that comes out of Hollywood under the genre title ""horror"" that they don't know good horror when it comes around. To me, this is the Exorcist of my generation; a movie that truly got under my skin, made it hard for me to sleep at night, and even gave me nightmares.
First the downfalls - the plot is admittedly thin at points. A lot of people have problems with such but I don't mind giving a suspension of belief in the cases of movies. Where as the Blair Witch Project made it's reputation by making it quite clear what the movie was about, the Ring instead had trailers that let on little, if anything, about the characters or the plot. If you don't know anything about this movie, as I did when I went in, then you're in for a treat. There are the occasional cheap scares (it's quiet then something flies out or something along those lines) but this movie goes deeper than most horror flicks can ever hope to.
The acting is very convincing. Probably not Oscar worthy by any means but it'll take you into the story and not let you go until it's over. Everything from the prop creation to set design is dead on - they could film just the sets alone and they'd be creepy. Having never seen the original, Ringu, I can't compare them but the story has a way of tying itself together, weaving a series of seemingly unrelated things together.
This probably hasn't been the best review but if you're a fan of horror movies, or just like to be scared, then do yourself a favor and rent this movie, get a friend over, turn off the lights and get ready for a scary experience. Amazingly, this is PG-13 but I don't think kids should see this all; it's not the gore but the haunting imagery that will stick in your mind for weeks later.",1046649600,5,1908,4.332402234636872
1407444,5,B000059HCH,"""The Ring"" is different from almost every other horror flick out there today.  There's not a lot of gore in it.  There's no monster, per se.  And there's no big shocks until the very end.
Yet it's still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.
Yes, ""The Ring"" is one of those rare gems that keeps the suspense and intensity going throughout the film.  From the very beginning scene where two girls talk about watching the tape to the very end, which has a twist that will have you sleeping with the lights on, there is an uneasy tone to the movie that keeps you on edge, waiting to see what happens next.
The acting is good in this movie, although the only person you've probably heard of is Naomi Watts, who plays a newspaper reporter who's niece viewed the tape and died seven days later.  She of course views the tape, then gets a chilling phone call that says ""seven days"".  Most of the rest of the film has to do with her trying to find out where the tape came from and how to prevent her from dying.  Her ex-boyfriend assists in the endeavor, just slightly lightening the mood at times.
As I said the tone is very dark.  Unlike a lot of horror movies, which have some comic relief, there is nary a chuckle to be found in this one.  Much of this movie is disturbing, especially when they discover the horrible secret of the tape.  You sort of create a lot of your own fear here, because you almost always expect something bad to happen every time a character makes a move.  That adds to the tension and is one of the reasons why I liked this film so much.  You scare yourself more than this movie scares you just by thinking about it.
This is definitely a ""must-own"" DVD if you're a horror movie fan, and the extras look well worth the price.  Finding out more about the legend of the tape and getting to see it, uncut, for yourself is a great bonus.  And, like me when I saw the movie in theaters, you'll have a nerve-wracking week after you see this, wondering if the legend is really true.",1046649600,6,2002,4.275862068965517

It was the kind of movie that you just got so into, you were sitting in the theater yelling at the screen and going ""Oh my God!"" at the end. I went to see it with a friend who within the first 20 minutes was begging me to leave because she thought it was so scary. We went out to dinner afterwards and could barely talk we were so freaked out. I really want to buy this DVD but am not sure if I could watch it again on my own.
Before The Ring, the scariest movie I have ever seen is The Omen but I think The Ring might be ahead now. It is so much better than those teen slasher flicks, it is smart, very suspenseful, and very creepy. Everyone in it had excellent performances, and the young boy brought in a Sixth Sense element. I have always been freaked out by scary kids. (Not to mention the little girl!!!)

1407448,4,B000059HCH,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have been anxiously awaiting its release on DVD ever since. However, this movie is NOT what everyone has made it out to be.
This is not a scary movie, per se. Due to the style in which it was shot and edited, there are moments that ""JUMP-OUT!"" and therefore make one shoot from their seat in a quick rush of adrenaline. I cannot state enough how very much I appreciate how this movie managed to incite a factor of fear without going for the ""gross-out"" technique that most modern horror films do opt for. In my mind, that's too easy. It's by far more intriguing to lead a viewer down a path and let their own imagination do most of the work. I believe the rather jumpy cinematic style & story to The Ring accentuates this idea and becomes the catalyst for the few scares you will inevitably receive watching it.
For those of you out there that have the ability to see far beyond what's just on the screen... for those that can see meaning and depth lurking in the far corners behind Hollywood shine, The Ring offers another dimension. My girlfriend and I were both immediately struck by one larger than life metaphor carried through out this movie. To this day, however, I'm amazed that any person I've spoke to has never once glimpsed a part of it, and ironically The Ring addresses this very phenomenon.
Yes, you will get a physical rise out of The Ring, but it offers so much more. Samara isn't just a ghost. She epitomizes the downfall of our society's culture through being spoon fed media 24-7. The movie constantly alludes to this very idea. Over and over, actually. TV is everywhere, in every home, at every moment... pervading every mind. How many people in the world sit and blankly stare at their TV's without a thought in their heads? Flat-lined frontal lobes. The mind is dead from too much televised anesthesia.
TV can kill... both onscreen and off.",1046649600,4,1899,4.555555555555555
1407449,4,B000059HCH,"Ok, let me start by saying that I saw The Ring in the theater and it scared the bejeesus out of me, not so much in the theater as over the next few days in my own home.
How scary is it?  It's probably an individual thing.  Some people can't stand the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard, for others it's the sound of a squeaking balloon; I thought the Exorcist was a joke, some people call it still the scariest movie ever.  For myself, I don't think I've ever seen a movie that freaked me out as much as this one, but that's just me.  I guess that what tweaks that sensitive nerve is different in everybody.
There has also been a lot of comparison between The Ring and the original Japanese Ringu, mostly by reviewers whose level of discrimination and taste are, by their own admission, far beyond that of the average American.  Please!  Most criticism in this area is just snobbery.  Ok, I haven't seen Ringu, and I admit that The Ring probably has suffered to some extent in it's adaptation for American audiences.  For example, the cursed video contains some images which are meant to be disturbing but which do not have anything to do with the movie, and that probably weakens it.  But the original Ringu video (which I've seen) is only about 40 seconds long, too short for an element so central to the film.  On the plus side, The Ring's production values are outstanding and the acting is solid.  I'm sure The Ring stands up nicely next to the original.
To Verbinski's credit, The Ring doesn't succumb to the temptation to explain everything.  That may make the movie seem disjointed and plotless to some, but in my view such spoon feeding is usually just patronizing.  Some ambiguity here is probably a good thing.
I can't promise that this movie will scare everyone, but if my TV (which is broken) ever turns itself on and shows static, I'm running!",1046649600,21,1859,4.513432835820896

Rather than the rather mundane and repetitve slash and thrash horror movies of late, this film actually takes the time to build a up a disturbing atmosphere, which means that the suspense is not limited to jumpy scenes or scary settings. There are NO plot holes in this film. It ties together very nicely, and will suit those who like a little but of thought to their movies, as well as those who just plain like to be scared.

The plot is a little difficult at first, but you catch on pretty quick.

1407454,5,B000059HCH,"As far as horror movies go, The Ring is on the top of my list for frightening me.  It's not very often that a grown man sits up late at night wondering if something is going to happen to him by an unknown attacker, let alone one that is supernatural.  As has been previously stated, it is impossible to go into any detail about the plot without giving away any of the film's best points.
I will have to deviate from the previous reviews, however.  The Ring does use ""slasher"" style gore to scare you, but I have never seen it used in a better way, ever.  Verbinski did an incredible job with his filming style, a way that really allows the dark, disturbing imagery of the movie to get under your skin and stay there.  It's almost like the movie is, as the film itself quotes, ""someone's nightmare caught on tape"".
In addition, the way that this movie sets you up, and then hits you with terror is done extremely well.  The film hits you from all angles with scenes and plot twists that you will never see coming and will make you jump in your seat from time to time.  It's almost surreal how much the movie can affect you.
But only if you let it.
The Ring has one fatal flaw in it, in that it will only appeal to you if you allow it to.  Those who have seen Blair Witch will understand what I mean.  <soapbox>As a side note, I firmly believe that people go to movies to be entertained and to be drawn into the film itself.  A movie that does this can and will succeed.  On the other hand, if you go into a film trying to pick it apart and doubt everything that is thrown at you, you will leave with nothing.</soapbox>
The acting is done very well, with Naomi Watts in particular.  She is very believable as not only a determined reporter, but a caring mother and jaded lover.  Brian Cox's portrayal as a tortured father on the edge of sanity adds another shade to an already dark experience.  Finally, David Dorfman does an outstanding job as the aloof, almost psychic son of Naomi Watts' character.
All in all, this movie does justice to the price tag you will pay for it.  For the full effect, turn off all the lights in your home, pull all the shades shut, and lock your doors.  The Ring is a ride you won't soon forget.",1046390400,5,2223,4.244655581947743

If you have never seen this movie, I seriousally suggest you buy the dvd. All I can say is that this movie is without a doubt the scariest movie I've ever seen. With a great twist of an ending, I left the theatre very surprised at what I had just sene. And I mean that in a good way definitely.

1407456,3,B000059HCH,"This movie creeps you in a subtle but creative way. It doesn't splatter buckets of blood or show graphic gore but the visual images are still haunting and greatly add to a mostly intriguing plot.
Although it boasts no major casting, the acting works sufficiently. The DTS surround sound effects were only minimal and unfortunately, greatly under-utilized. Increased surround effects could have greatly complemented the visual montage and made this movie even more chilling.
Reminiscent of 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Ring' also features another overly serious and sensitive child character who seems to sense death. The dark and bizarre visual images will remind you of music video images by Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson and function well in setting up a mood of gloom, suspense and dread.
'The Ring' frightens but also leaves you with many unanswered questions. Since it is generally entertaining, the incoherence of the film isn't fully realized until you are done watching it. If you don't mind pondering questions and forming your own conclusions after the movie, the incoherence is entertaining and chillingly provocative.",1046304000,4,1129,5.312849162011173

While ""The Ring"" does provide some legitimately tense moments I don't think it's AS scary some would lead you to believe.  That's not to say it's not a good movie, in fact it's very good, with some borderline great performances.  Naomi Watts proves ""Mulholland Drive"" was no fluke by serving up another strong showing.  Thankfully she doesn't vamp up her role with unnecessary shrieking, screaming, etc.  Nice job.  Brian Cox is downright creepy in his role.
""The Ring"" however is not without a couple of plot holes that prevent it from being a great movie.  They're pretty glaring so I won't risk spoiling anything for you by going into it here.  Definitely watch it for yourself and decide.",1046217600,3,839,4.684931506849315

The Ring on DVD is a third type of horror movie. It is one that scares you because of what you don't know what it is exactly that you are seeing. It will keep you guessing until the end. I was into the first half because it was so freaking scary, but more into the second because I didn't know what was going to happen next. And boy...what an ending!
For someone who loves to scare kids as much as I do with my nieces, putting them through this movie would be like child abuse. I would not suggest this for kids...unless they think they can handle it. Even the FBI Warning and menu are freaky.

a) Slumber party / Sleepover
b) Horror movie marathon, and

The RIng starts off like any horror movie with a teenage victim.  The girl Katie watched the video with three friends and within a week they all die.  After that her Aunt Rachel goes out to solve the mystery.  She ends up finding the tape and watching it.  She now has a week to solve it.  As the mystery dwells deeper into the tale of a family with a bad misfortune many years ago and the stranger mystery of their daughter leading to a chilling finale, if not a little over done.
Now for the biggest complaint. When my brother first saw this it immediatly reminded him of Silent Hill (Most chilling Playstation game ever) and how at the time of it's release it was so dark and freaky that we couldn't play it in the dark.  Well like any gutsy horror fan I watched this in the dark, in it's entirty.  I wasn't afraid once.  Disturbed once or twice, but not frightened.  I also got the feeling that it was released shortly after Fear Dot Com because in many ways the two movies were similar.  Obviously this one was better made.  Also the ending was way drawn out (By ending I mean the Jumper FInale that is in all Horror Films).  However past that you have a very solid horror film that is surprisingly PG-13.

1407463,2,B000059HCH,"Of all the horror films to be released as of late, I really did want to see The Ring, basically because I wanted to know how good or bad a PG-13 rated horror movie could be.  After seeing countless horror films trying to be scary and frightening by using predictable tactics and loading on computer generated blood and gore, my faith that horror films of old that didn't rely on blood, gore, and gross out effects to be scary (Poltergeist, Pumpkinhead, the original Halloween) would be returning in films such as The Ring, but I was very disappointed. The film starts out with an eerie opening and some nice scares leading up to an investigation by a reporter (Naomi Watts from Mulholland Drive) into the death of her niece which involved a video tape rumored that if one watches it, seven days later you'll die. While the storyline is interesting and has a bit of originality to it, it seems that director Gore Verbinski wanted the film to be too suspenseful. Not to mention some things are never explained in the film (such as why the horses flipped out) and by the time the credits start rolling you'll have more questions than answers. The acting is pretty well done, but the child actor playing Watts' son seems a bit out of place and a little creepy himself.  What really makes me wonder though is how big a hit The Ring was in theaters, most of which were populated by mid-teen girls who had never heard of and/or seen any films gracing titles like Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pumpkinhead, Last House On the Left, or Hellraiser.  Those films were original (the first installments of the ones which became a series that is) and truly deeply scary.  The Ring is simply overrated, and is teen horror at it's near worst.

The way the story is told, in the day-long increments, until the finale on the 7th day does a fairly good job of providing some feeling of dread but it doesn't cover up for the lack of any real story. Naomi Watts could very well be the worst actress to have ever graced the silver-screen, and who in the world is Gore Verbinski supposed to be (the director); that sounds like a name we are supposed to know, one that is connected with the horror movie genre, yeah well don't get too confused... his last two movies were, ""Mouse Hunt,"" and, ""The Mexican"" (both milquetoast).

I have heard mostly negative things about the film, so I was expecting a movie that was cheap on thrills and poorly directed. I was in for a total shock. The Ring is a creepy, well directed movie.
The opening sequence is pretty much an homage to the movie ""Scream."" Ehren Kreuger, The Ring's writer wrote Scream 3. From the opening sequence the movie hooked me. I will not give it away, but I was actually on the edge of my seat wondering what the hell was going to happen. After this well directed opening sequence, we get into the real story. Naomi Watts, an actress that should be really famous already, plays a reporter named Rachel. After a death, Rachel investigates the mysterious circumstances around the death and discovers a video tape.
The less you know going in the better. So in order to not to ruin anything don't read the next paragraph....
**This tape is weird. It has images of disembowelment, which is a quick flash cut. A crazy lady, and a weird little girl. If you watch it, as soon as it's over you get a phone call saying you have 7 days to live. Some weird, creepy, and somewhat scary stuff. Rachel watches it, and becomes marked for death by the unknown reaper. Now she has to race the clock to find out who's behind the tape**
Here's the bottom line....
I liked this film alot! The middle needed some tightening and maybe a couple more knee jerk scares. But I was cool with the movie as a whole. The ending, which is what a lot of people I spoke with before hand didn't like, was good. The audience clapped, and of course it left it open for a sequel, or sequels I should say. The movie is really creepy, and since I'm not scared easily, I wasn't scared, just along for this ride not knowing what to expect. I have been desensitized by horror flicks so I'm not easily scared. I was happy to see that this movie was not disrespectful to the Horror Genre. It could have easily been another ""Bless The Child"" or something along that line. It wasn't.
The Good.....
Naomi Watts is wonderful. She should be famous already, and the camera loves her.
The Direction is good. Gore Verbinski's direction is tight, clean, and suspenseful without too much gore.
The Writing is good, Ehren Krueger makes up for Scream 3
The Imagery is creepy.
The Bad....
Middle part is a bit long.
The Mother-Son relationship between Watts and The Weird Kid who played her son wasn't too convincing.
The actor who played her son seemed like he went to the Haley Joel Osment knockoff school of acting.
One more death scene would have made me satisfied completely.

I saw this with some friends back in November, one of whom had already seen it once before. He warned me that this was no typical horror movie and that it was the scariest movie he had ever seen. So being one not to be scared by movies I didn't think much of this. Wow. Was he ever right.

 It's about a mysterious videotape that if you watch it, you're supposed to die a week later. Sounds simple, but this movie is somewhat incoherant and confusing. That doesn't stop it from doing what it was made to do, and that's scare you, a lot. At this it succeeds by a long shot. The  deadly video in the movie looks like something straight out of one of the band Tool's videos. The Ring has more than a couple of moments that scare you by instant shock, while messing with your head the whole way through. I think the whole row literally jumped up out of our seats at one part in the movie. So there's never really a dull moment. I love the mood of the film, as it stays dark and dreadful the whole way through.

1407470,4,B000059HCH,"After being barraged with countless trailers and promotions for all the movies that come out, I somehow manage to find only three or four really worthwhile movies that I like every year.
Despite some of the criticisms leveled at The Ring by a variety of disparate sources, I consider it to be (if not a masterpiece) a provocative and entertaining movie.
I watched this movie without the corrupting influence of Ringu to color my views. I have yet to see Ringu (I await its imminent release on the 4th), so I have rated The Ring based on its own merits rather than comparing it to the original (which by the way differed so much from Koji's book as to relegate criticism leveled at Kubrick's ""The Shining"" for its lack of similarity to King's book to a low level of believability).
I bring up Kubrick to make a point... I consider Verbinski's ""The Ring"" to be just as frightening as Kubrick's ""The Shining."" And when evaluating the merits of Kubrick's work, it is unfair to compare it to another source (in this case the book). It is similarly unfair to criticise differences in Ringu and The Ring. Carbon copies stink of redundance... and the twists that Verbinski adds to his work to ""Americanize"" it should give Ringu fans another perspective from which to view the characters.
The other source of criticism lobbed at The Ring stems from what some consider to be an editing problem on a massive scale. I argue that this was intentional and fit the schizophrenic and unpredictable plot better than spoonfeeding us the whole thing. The whole reason that the movie was frightening to me was that it had all these subtle connections (like the fly on the tape walking in circles) that you had to really look hard to notice. And those little things added to the subtle ghost story that is The Ring.
Upon watching the first scene, I was worried that this was going to be another teeny flick, but then I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the teeny-bop feel of the beginning was incidental and that the plot would be mainly played out by adults. In fact, one of the strongest points of The Ring is that, unlike most horror bilge, it does not use violence to carry the plot. Of the relatively few deaths that occur, I can say that each was in the plot for a definitive reason. There was no ritual ""killing of the excess characters"" that always seems to be a staple of the more ""R-ish"" rated movies in Hollywood this century.
And this is the real terror of the movie. There are a few jump scenes (including the infamous final sequence that still makes me nervous when I walk past my TV) but the feeling of dread is constant. I could not distinguish points in the movie when there was less or more dread (as one can usually do in horror flicks to accurately predict such jump moments) so the few BOO!s that there were had me surprised and scared.
The Ring was more than anything else a classical ghost story wrapped in the facade of a modern setting. In fact, I was reminded in some scenes of the last great ghost story to grace the theaters... The Shining. The difference being that the ghostly Samara chooses to haunt our technology rather than be constrained to a specific place. This is an interesting cultural event... our world has been ""shrunk"" by technology and people are no longer tied to one locale. Neither is the haunting in this remarkably innovative movie.
Overall, I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be frightened sans knowing that a good portion of their ticket cost will be paying for the massive quantities of katchup used to produce the film. Verbinski's ""The Ring"" is an intelligent movie for an intelligent audience that will neither compare it mindlessly with its predecessor or need the actors to spoonfeed them the whole plot in direct dialogue. So, go watch it. You know, you have to, because... Before you die, you see ""The Ring""!",1045353600,64,3874,4.615942028985507

Anyway, I highly recommend this movie. It has the scares, some (but not much) humor, and a gorgeous leading character (Ms Watts).

1407473,5,B000059HCH,"I have to say, I was quite impressed with The Ring. Over the last few years I've started to become a fan of the horror genre. The trouble is, the more horror films I see, the less they manage to actually frighten me. And, to me, that's rather the whole point.
Resident Evil got my vote not because the zombies were scary, but because it had some good shocks and nice action. The Ring is a very different type of movie, closer to horror than action.
From the very first scene of the movie the eerie atmosphere is set very well. If you're actually watching the movie, it's near impossible not to get into the creepy mood. Even if you're just waiting for ""it"" to happen, whatever it may be. The movie makes it quite clear, it will happen, and you do not know what it is. It's a really refreshing take from recent films where the villian is obvious.
I've heard numerous reports of people losing sleep over this movie and having trouble leaving it at the theater. I can't say I found it frightening to that level, but it still managed to send a good chill down my spine throughout the film and startle me a number of times. I was shaking a bit coming out of the theater, I'm hoping it's because it was rather cold. ^_^;
The horror is broken up from time to time with interesting and entertaining exploration and story development. However, just when you think the movie is switching from a horror flick to an interesting mystery flick, the horror elements return, in force.
Although parts of the movie are somewhat corny, and many reports of the movie are of course over hyped, you will indeed at least be creeped out and entertained throughout. It's certainly worth seeing, and I'd recommend seeing it with a friend. You'll have a hard time not giving away the details if you don't.
And if you like to bring a gullible, easily scared girl to the movies with you, don't be surprised if you end up jumping a few times yourself. ^_^ Don't worry, your friends who have seen it as well won't laugh at you... too much.

But, when her aunt,the reporter, begin to look for evidence like Sherlock Holmes, I guessed it will end like DRAGONFLY or WHAT LIES BENEATH.
But I was wrong when it show WHY THEY DIED. The figure of ""the creature"", suprisingly, is very very Asian banshee style. White clothes, long hair, black eyes and skinny.

1407478,3,B000059HCH,"It's generally difficult to understand the logic behind an english language remake of foreign language films - Are subtitles *that* much of a pain? - but atleast when the remake is of the same quality as the original you have some justification.
This isn't. It doesn't come close to matching the suspense and creeping terror that the Japanese original has, and - like the nationality issues in ""Insomnia"" - there are important elements of the plot that simply cannot survive translation out of it's native language and setting.
The tone of the film is different as well, and the originals erie emphasis on the psychic is diluted. Rewrites - and the apparent inclusion of material from the second film - are to blame for the somewhat disjointed and illogical way in which the film proceeds. Other than that, there's nothing really *wrong* with this film - it's just hard to see the point in making it in the first place. It becomes just another horror movie.
Either of the two Japanese sequels (Ring2 and Ring0) are better than this, and neither was as good as the original. However, if ""Scream"" et al. are your idea of a good horror movie, then you will probably like this. You might even be impressed.

1407479,5,B000059HCH,"There was a time when horror films were fun, scary, and exciting. Lately, they have lost their edge, becoming nothing more than horrendous parodies of themselves-- greenlit by money-hungry producers looking to make a quick buck. Horror films used to cause excitement amongst moviegoers. Now, whenever a horror flick is released, it quickly gets lost in the crowd of comedies and quasi star-vehicles. Frequently ignored at the mainstream box-office but made so cheaply, these films more often than not make a profit, inspiring countless unnecessary sequels, keeping those suited tyrants smiling all the way to the bank.
Just in time for Halloween, a handful of horror films were released. Amongst them was ""The Ring,"" an American remake of a 1998 Japanese hit, adapted by ""Arlington Road"" and ""Scream 3"" scribe Ehren Kruger. Here is a fine example of a modern horror film that actually thrills, and proof that strong word of mouth can greatly benefit a good film not expected to do as well. Not only is this one of the best horror films ever made, it is also one of the few remakes that actually fare better than the original.

""The Ring"" is a surprisingly effective and subtle horror film that, through genuine wit and intelligence, stands out amongst the computer-generated messes that pass for Hollywood's current attempt at horror. It's a surprisingly dark film that stands in nihilistic contrast to the feel-good, life-affirming style of horror typified by The Sixth Sense and its many imitations.

""The Ring"" sets up its central premise with admirable speed and clarity. Supposedly, there's an urban legend about a mysterious, unmarked video tape that somehow causes the death, seven days later, of anyone unlucky enough to watch it. One unfortunate viewer is the niece of neurotic reporter and single mother Naomi Watts. While investigating her niece's death, Watts has the misfortune of watching the tape herself. The premise is beautifully set up in a simple opening scene that uses a ringing telephone and the image of a static-filled TV screen, as well as a pulse-pounding musical score, to whip up a sudden crescendo of tension.

Director Gore Verbinski's (The Mexican) visualization of what is on that tape has to be counted as one of the film's major triumphs. He is to be commended for not taking the easy route of filling the screen with explicit but meaningless ""shock"" images: instead, he creates a creepy collage of surreal but recognizable pictures. They have the disturbing power to get under the viewer's skin with such skill that it creates a feeling of continually growing dread which doesn't become obvious until it's already too late to escape.

Having watched the tape, Watts soon receives a phone call informing her that she (and apparently, the film's audience) now has precisely seven days left to live. Refreshingly, Watts goes against American horror film convention by neither ignoring the threat or attempting to escape in the stupidest, most illogical way possible. Instead, she immediately sets about to figure out what the tape means and how she can prevent her own seemingly inevitable demise. Aiding her in this endeavor are her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her disconcertingly Haley Joel Osmentish son (wonderfully played by David Dorfman in a very creepy performance).

This is the rare Hollywood horror film that actually respects its audience's intelligence enough not to have its heroine freaked out by finding a stray cat wandering around the pantry. Instead, Verbinski gets his scares by filming an off-center vision of a world that is recognizably our own. He has the patience to create a subtle atmosphere that prays not on our immediate impulses, but on the usually hidden fears that lurk within us all--the knowledge that at any moment, our life could end for reasons we'll never know.

In horror films, the less you know, the scarier things are. Verbinski understands that the camera creates tension just by moving; he builds anticipation and suspense about what could be lurking just outside the frame, while rarely revealing what it might be. The look of fear so clearly expressed by his characters is always more chilling than any monster he might turn his camera on. Perhaps Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is when the film's main horror finally does make itself visible after dominating the viewer's imagination, it still manages to be as frightening as anything we could have visualized in our mind's eye. Yes, I was absolutely terrified!

Though this film is obviously designed to showcase the skills of its director, one cannot ignore how much of the film's success comes from Naomi Watts' performance as a very untypical horror heroine. Playing her role with an unstable neurotic streak, Watts manages to make her character endearing, frustrating and, most importantly, real. In a time when so many horror films tend to present women as either cute survivors or victims born only to be exploited and punished, Watts gives us a recognizable human being who, though understandably terrified, displays welcome strength and determination, giving the film a needed boost of reality.

""The Ring"" is a handsomely mounted, intelligently crafted thriller that skillfully maintains a tense sense of dread. The crisp editing, fluid camera work, meticulous production design, menacing score and gloomy Pacific Northwest locations all contribute to the unsettling atmosphere, as does Verbinski's decision to use primal horror imagery, rather than gore and cheap scare tactics, to unnerve us.

Verbinski and company have crafted an exemplary thriller, and maybe one of the year's best films. I have not seen a thriller as disturbing and satisfying since the likes of Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" or Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others.""  ""The Ring"" is a true masterpiece of modern horror, which is wonderful considering Hollywood hasn't pumped out any consistently good edge-of-your-seat films in quite some time. Maybe ""The Ring"" will help change this. One can only hope.",1044230400,4,6032,5.183778234086242
1407480,5,B000059HCH,"I have seen all the major horror films: Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, the list goes on and on.  My favorite movie when I was 6 was the movie Poltergeist.  I have never been afraid of a horror movie until now.
The Ring scared me so badly that I had nightmares for about a week.  I had to keep my TV covered because I was afraid of it.  The Ring has a great way of making a viewer afraid of common household appliances like the phone, the TV, the VCR... it is great!  There are many twists that the viewer is not anticipating and that keeps the movie going.  Just when you think you know what direction the movie is about to go in, it surprises you again.  The Ring is also filled with many disturbing visual surprises and even the editing is unique compared to most scary movies.  Many of the images will haunt you long after you see the movie.
I also highly recommend seeing the original Japanese version of the movie called Ringu.  It is much more subtle than the American version, but I think I respect it more for that reason.  Some portions of the story simply make more sense in the Japanese version.  However, the American version has scarier special effects and the mental institution scenes really add to the movie.  Still, it is tough to decide who is scarier, Sadako or Samara, but both are wonderfully frightening in their own way.
If you love to be scared, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  I can't say enough great things about it.  Please, see both versions.  I won't say anymore because part of what makes the movie scary is having no prior knowledge of what makes it that intense... one of my friends was told how it ended and it did not scare her at all because of it.

I have been extremely disappointed with the ""scary"" movies of this generation (Halloween sequals, Freddy Kreuggar, Jason, The Blair Witch, Scream etc).  The fear in those movies, is so obvious, you might be frightened the first time but you can't ever enjoy a second round of it after you've already seen it in the movie theater.  Well, guess what people...this is the real deal.  This movie didn't really get a lot of hype (I thought) for the fear it instills in you. I didn't even want to see it until my sister raved about it for days. It's amazing!!! You take this fear home with you after you watch it.  It lingers like smoke and just when you think it's gone (the fear), you're by yourself, doing laundry at 12 midnight and you keep seeing these images.  When you're driving home, by yourself, AT NIGHT... it pops into your mind and you are deathly afraid again...your heart's racing, you're getting sweaty...""Why, oh why do I do this to myself?...I'll  bet you step on it a bit to get home a little quicker.

If you have ever seen 13 Ghost's, you'll know how scary that parana ghost guy is that attacks the daughter (the guy with his head in a box).  Well, multiply that by 100 and this is what you feel for about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I went to see it in the movies (just once) with my sister and I ended up missing the last 45 minutes (truthfully) because I was so scared. I had a greasy napkin (from eating popcorn) held up to my glasses with my pinkies (covering them) and my thumbs in my ears humming Silent Night Holy Night just so I could breath because I was so frightened.  I lost my breath a few times.  I am extrememly anxious for March 4, 2003 so I can receive my copy to actually (try) to view this movie ... again.  For those of you who have already seen this movie...How freaked out was I when the buttery surface of my glasses distorted my view of everything following the movie?!!!

The Ring is sure enought to scare you half to death and keep you very involved with the film. The acting is very good and the movie is amazing. A definate must see.",1043366400,,793,3.871165644171779
1407495,5,B000059HCH,"Actually on a scale of 1 to 5 This deserves a 100. It is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. After I watched it in the theater I wanted to watch it again I saw it about 3 and a half months ago and ever since I just wanted to see it over and over and wondering when it was going to come out on DVD and now it finally has a release date and I just can not wait. It has a very solid story that is very chilling and unlike any other horror movie out there. After seeing it I bought the Japanese version Ring 1, Ring 2 and Ring 0 which are all very good also but the american one just has much more to it to hold it together more and tell more of the story it is very cool and the end is very chilling. This is a must for every person who loves watching creepy movies.",1043280000,,768,3.6890243902439024
1407496,5,B000059HCH,"Granted, the plot of this movie has a few holes, but it is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen.  Scarier than even ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Shinning"".  I saw this movie four times and it never stopped being scary.  It sticks with you for a long time after you leave the theatre.  If you think your kids watch too much television, all you have to do is show them this movie, and they'll never want to go near the set again.",1043193600,2,427,4.0476190476190474
1407497,3,B000059HCH,"Having watched the original (which I liked), I made a super conscious effort not to compare the two. But really, the remake leaves much to be desired even without comparing the two. We get the customary recycled scenes from horror movies past - dumb teens from a hundred slasher movies discussing boys (""did you sleep with him? Omigod you did!"") and urban legends; Naomi choking on electrodes (beats throwing up bugs and other crawlies I expect); the super insightful child with lousy social skills (at least Haley Osment was likeable); the really evil child a' la Damien (Damien was the devil's son, but what's up with this girl?); animals (horses in this case) spooked by the evil presence (remember the zoo scene in the Omen - that was way scarier); and the list goes on. For me, the last straw was showing the evil girl's face in all its gory detail at the end. Was I the only one who thought she was a dead ringer (pardon me Mr Cronenberg) for Linda Blair? Or was that effect intentional? In the original, the girl's face remains masked by her hair - a much creepier effect. She ""senses"" her way towards the victims without making eye contact - killing is impersonal and senseless ""nothing personal mate, but you're next"". And you wait in anticipation for the hair to part, which it doesn't and preserves the enigma and the mystery.
Having said that, the remake is standard horror fare and gets 3 stars for effort. If you can, catch the original. There is a real sense of melancholia in the original - it is essentially a terribly sad story about betrayal (in the case of the child in the well), and redemption where the protagonists risk their lives to save their own child who has seen the video. Even in redemption, there is loss, as the child's father loses his life in the end. Hope you sense like I did at the end of the movie (either one) that somehow The Ring is a veiled reference to those pesky chain letters one receives, and discards with great trembling hands.",1043107200,8,1978,4.558988764044944
1407498,5,B000059HCH,"I think what impressed me most about this movie is that it was the scariest that I had seen since ""The Exorcist"". And yet it was not at all gory or gross; it definitely doesn't play to the lowest common denominator. And let's face it: today's audiences have been so innudated what blood, gore, and gross-out movie effects, that such things just aren't scary anymore. Now, when I see a particularly graphic movie, I'm not thinking ""Oh my God!"", I'm thinking, ""How did they create that effect?"". Many times, I have heard movie audiences laugh or hoot when someone gets eviscerated. The gross-out factor actually works AGAINST creating a sense of horror. But in this movie, the shocking shots are so brief, they're almost subliminal. Somehow, that makes them VERY frightening; you're left thinking, ""What the hell was that?"" Believe me, this movie will stay with you long after the last frame.",1043107200,,890,4.8618421052631575
1407499,4,B000059HCH,"Having seen both of them, and having liked the original alot I came into the theatre very skeptical. Being an Otaku of years past I had come to believe that all things in Japan were better than anything America could conjure up. I sat down and I was scared. This movie is visually more frightening and more scary than the Japanese. I also like the fact that they took out that the reporter's boyfriend was somewhat of a telepath. I felt that didn't really add to the story or aid it in any way. Though Espers, telepaths, and the like are key elements in Japanese horror they don't translate well to Western audiences.
Overall I liked The Ring and I found it more scary than the original.",1043107200,2,687,4.417322834645669

7933420,1,B000059HCH,"What a load of rubbish! This is a total convoluted mess that takes itself seriously. It would be great had there been a sensible plot. This is not even worth reviewing the ""plot"" that is sort of there -- because it really does not matter which part of the plot you chose to focus on. Something is bound to ""stick"". I do not recommend wasting your time trying to figure out what happened, why it happened, if it will happen again, who it happens to, who made the videotape, why they made the videotape, how Naomi Watts manages to ""solve"" the mystery (quite a bit of luck going on there!), etc. It is simply a constantly morphing plot that just wants to keep showing ""scary"" images. This is not how a good horror film is made.",1515024000,,724,4.330882352941177

7933422,4,B000059HCH,"A mysterious and eerie video tape has broken out to the public where after someone watches it, they'll receive a phone call shortly after warning the viewer that they'll die in 7 days. Rachel, a Seattle newspaper journalist is weary of the whole situation--until her niece, Katie dies under mysterious circumstances after viewing the tape. She also learns of 3 other teenagers who also suffered the same fate upon viewing the tape.

Desperate to unravel the answers to her investigation, Rachel allows her curiosity to get the better of her, causing her to track down the tape. Willing to sacrifice herself to find the answers she needs, Rachel views the tape and is pulled into a psychological, supernatural world where she also drags her ex-boyfriend, Noah and their son, Aiden in as unwilling recipients. With each passing day, Rachel gets closer and closer to exposing the dark, bizarre secrets the tape contains; but with that she also gets closer to the end of her 7 days.

Overall: Call me crazy, but until recently I'd never seen The Ring and it had been on my ""to watch"" list for a long while. The Ring was a remake of the 1998 Japanese original with the same plot. Right off the bat, while The Ring had its fair share of eerie moments, nothing about the film really creeped me out at all. I can only assume that maybe the 1998 original does a better job since many Japanese films also tend to excel in the horror genre. Despite that, it was still worth the watch. I found The Ring to have elements of other horror films like Urban Legend (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001). We do get some nice character development between the 3 main characters: Rachel, her son, Aiden, and Noah. Although it's never really revealed why Aiden called Rachel by her first name instead of mom, which bothered me a bit (nit-picking I know). If you're looking for blood and violence, you picked the wrong film. The Ring specializes more in psychological horror, so a lot of the scenes will be more focused on getting in your head than trying to gross you out or make you cringe at a violent scene.

Overall, despite this being a remake, it was a pretty good remake for a 4 year time difference. But obviously this is and never will be as good as the original RING/Ringu movie. The Ring does manage to live up to all the hype that surrounds its name and pays off for being a wholesome psychological horror film",1509408000,,2394,4.575757575757576
