7960835,4,B000065AYG,"I have to admit, I don't like opera too much, but since I saw this performance live, I was curious to compare it to the DVD. Live one listened to the music more, and enjoyed the singing, which to my lay ears was lovely. But the DVD brings out the great acting and details, a very intricate and well told story. These are no mere singers that 'stand and sing'. So as an alternative to grand opera with the clicheed personification and empty gesture I would say - here is a finely told story of an aging woman, her lusts, loves and the intrigues of the court around her. That ultimately the DVD is more watchable that the performance means for me the director's failure to create viable theater, and he should stick to film. The details of this are exquisite and the stripping scenes (which caused so much controversy) are for me entirely believable and enhance the personification. Again, this was not my impression in the live performance, but that is not the subject of review here. Ultimately, watching Alice Coote and Helene Schneiderman is worth everything.",1052524800,9,1061,4.648936170212766
7960836,1,B000065AYG,I must say that I had difficulties watching this opera to the end.  I only did so because of the music.  The singing was quite good but otherwise two words are enough to discribe this production: ridiculous and disgusting.  It seemed that the performers were all the time kicking and hitting eachothers or furniture or walls.  Or they were undressing themselves or making love to eachothers.  The performance had very little to do with Handel.  I certainly can't recommend this DVD to any opera or Handel fan.,1042588800,9,509,4.793103448275862
7960837,2,B000065AYG,"Handel's vocal music always thrills me and ALCINA is one of my favorite operas. Because of the wild physical demands of any production of this opera, it is very rarely performed...never, to my knowledge, at the Metropolitan. I have never seen it and looked forward to this DVD of a production from Stuttgart in 1999.
I have absolutely no problem with contemporary directors and designers re-thinking classics (Robert Wilson's LOHENGRIN at the Met is one of my favorite productions of any opera) but I don't understand why some interpreters insist on changing what the composer and/or librettist wanted or, indeed, demanded. Almost everything one can watch on this DVD is unnecessary including gratuitous sex...or what passes for sex in opera. All this would be laughable were it not for the fact that Handel is getting mauled by much lesser artists.
The singers are good, but not one of them can come near the singers in both of the CD recordings available now...one led by Renee Fleming and the older version by the incomparable Joan Sutherland. But then, I don't think the director and designers of the Stuttgart version meant us to actually listen to the singers or to Handel's extraordinary music. They meant to make us watch their unnecessary tricks. 5 stars, then, for Handel's music, but that drops down to 2 because of this silly, unnecessary production. If you want to really hear ALCINA, buy one of the CD sets.",1027209600,13,1421,4.9004149377593365
