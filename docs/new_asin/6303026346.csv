544602,5,6303026346,"I didn't know what to expect when I got these but I was in search of some nice animal dvds that didn't show everything that happens in the food chain cycle even though it is part of nature but it's not good for toddlers to watch until they are big enough and mature to understand what is happening. When I got these, I pop one in and held my breath, but I was pleasantly surprised, they were nice. The cat Madison is a bit cheesy but my 3 year old loves him. They do show some amimals eating a carcass, dont' remember if it was some lions but they passed it fast enough and nothing too graphic. These dvds were done in the 90's so be prepared that some things are a bit dated but nothing to worry about, if your kids like animals and learning about them, they will enjoy these. I love that each of the 3 dvds talk about tons of animals, some of which we have never heard of. I think we got a good deal too, it was around $21 for all 3 including shipping. Each dvd is over an hour, I don't remember how much but a lot.",1278979200,9,1017,3.9901960784313726
544603,5,6303026346,I thought this is a great DVD set for anybody who has toddlers at home. However after purchasing it when I play it for my 3 year old I have many at times found myself glued to the TV enjoying the narration...,1247702400,9,208,3.9761904761904763
544604,3,6303026346,"This is a relatively safe video for young children. My 3 year old watched it several times. It shows what animals eat, including other animals--it doesn't show the full hunt but it does make several mentions about animals that are going to eat another animal. I like the documentary format as my son doesn't need constant change of topic to stay interested. This video changes from one animal to the next fairly quickly, a little more than I would like, e.g. sometimes the video clip is not long enough for a child to understand what the animals are doing. My 3 year old had trouble following which animal was which, so I'd rather have a long-documentary style where it shows one animal at a time. This video purposely shows all ""Dinner Times"" for each animal, then it shows all ""Play Time"" for each animal, an so on, so that you see the animal many times throughout the course of the episode rather than connecting all of one animal's activities together. There are 6 episodes on the DVD and each episode contains about 6 animals broken down into groupings like ""Play Time"" and ""Dinner Time"". We viewed it from our library, but I'm holding off on buying til I check out some other animal videos.  Also, I believe this is narrated by Marc Summers, that famous voice from Nickelodeon and FoodTV and it has some rhyming as well as lots of cliche's and narration that is supposed to be funny to kids, which is lost on me and my 3 year old. We just want animals and I'd like to see more information that is helpful to a 3 year old trying to expand his understanding of the world.",1186617600,2,1575,4.46875
544605,4,6303026346,"This is another volume of ""Animated Classics of Japanese Literature,"" a series of video releases culled from a 1986 Japanese TV program, originally titled ""Famous Works of Japanese Literature."" It contains two stories, ""Wandering Days"" and ""Growing Up,"" both coming-of-age stories involving adolescent girls and based on stories by women authors. Both are a little downbeat, but not nearly as depressing as other entries in this series. ""Wandering Days,"" set in the early 20th century, focuses on young Fumiko and her attempts to excel in school despite her family's constant moving, thanks to her father's occupation as an itinerant seller of medicines. When a teacher in one town they settle in takes an interest in her writing, Fumiko begins to dream of a better life. ""Growing Up,"" set in the Meiji era, takes place in the red light district of Yoshiwara and focuses on life among the adolescents of the community, emphasizing the rift that develops between two friends, the beautiful young Midori, younger sister of a prominent Geisha, and her classmate, Shin, son of the local Buddhist monk, an inveterate drunkard.
""Wandering Days"" is distinguished by the watercolor backgrounds that depict life in this small, seaside town in the early 20th Century. The character design is simpler than it ought to be, but the narration, dialogue and evocative music score play up the literary tone and draw us fully into this young girl's difficult life. ""Growing Up"" is done in a completely different style from the rest of the series. The character design is more cartoonish, as if the characters were from a comic strip, and the background design is a little simpler, more sketchier, but all rendered with bold lines and bright colors. Interestingly, the characters are actually a lot more expressive than normal for this series. It's all done with taste and simplicity and the result is quite beautiful and touching. This tape is easily one of the best in an already distinguished series.",1059955200,2,1985,5.073394495412844

544728,5,6303026346,"My son loves these animal series. Outstanding footage of animals in their habitats. They make jokes, do some rhyming and sound effects making it more entertaining while learning. We used to check them out from the library but never seen all 3 DVDs so this was a real treat and bargain. We purchased ""used"" and it was like brand new. Very happy with this purchase.",1402963200,4,363,4.6
544729,2,6303026346,The cover on each of the DVD's is misleading. I expected to see a movie about penguins on the DVD with the picture of penguins on it. The movie was about fish eating other fish. Very disappointed in these DVD's.,1388275200,,211,4.3
544730,5,6303026346,"I bought this box set as a gift for my grandson.  We watched the DVDs together and I enjoyed them as much as he did.  While he was exclaiming over the animals and enjoying their antics, I was wondering just how they had captured such startlingly beautiful images.  Where on earth was the camera?  I didn't see even a shadow on the snow.  Really, they are just beautiful, informative, and watchable DVVDs.  Oh, and for those who have concerns, the food chain issue is deftly handled; no wounded-wildebeest-devoured-by-lions action here.",1387843200,11,535,4.888888888888889
544731,5,6303026346,"So neat to see animals we'd never otherwise see, and get to see them doing unique things (like ostriches competing to see who gets to take care of the herd of babies).  Great quality footage... does talk about evolution in one or two, but only as a five minute clip.  Otherwise very factual and interesting to watch (for both parents and kids!).",1372291200,2,345,4.548387096774194
544732,5,6303026346,"While looking for animal movies for our toddlers 7 years ago we got a couple of used Growing up Wild videos. We loved them from the start and started looking for more. I collected more, but never got all of the episodes, until recently when I bought the DVD package. My kids (the ones who were toddlers 7 years ago) were excited to see the new episodes... and my next set of toddlers are still loving all of them. Madison has introduced them to lots of fun little informational tidbits about different animals... some I had never seen or heard off... read between the lines... I enjoy them too.",1360540800,,594,4.458715596330276

544734,5,6303026346,My 18 year old autistic son loved these videos as VHS.  I've been trying to find them on DVD and didn't realize until I looked carefully that this was the same!  This boxed set had ALL of them!  He's enjoying watching them all over again!,1335312000,,238,4.2444444444444445
7835899,5,6303026346,"My grandson and I watched these movies together over and over and over and never got tired of them.  They are very educational.  If you are not into animal documentaries, you will be after watching these DVDs.  He has grown up and moved on to Star Wars type movies.  I would just like to watch these animal documentaries with him again.",1484784000,,336,4.459016393442623
7835900,1,6303026346,Till now I could not watch it since I live in Austria and the regional Code of the DVD does not match the regional code of my DVD set. When I ordered the DVD I did not know of this problem especially because my last orders -the Jungle Book and the Aristocats from the United States  - I could watch on my DVD set without having any problems. So now I do not know what to do to be able to watch my new DVDs .,1468972800,,407,3.7325581395348837
7835901,5,6303026346,So cute! I really wanted to watch it before I gifted it! The child I gave it to is 15 months old and he loves it. Educational and fun! His parents love watching it just as much as he does!,1459123200,,188,3.725

7835904,3,6303026346,"We were so excited to get this DVD until we put it on and realized the footage is very dated. Some of the footage is so old it appears almost fuzzy. Just a heads up on the quality, a little disappointing.",1426809600,,204,4.0
7835905,5,6303026346,This is a very good set on animals. We had the single VHS of Kittens & Caboodles and watched it SO many times I didn't know if the tape would break soon. This is very informative for you gets to learn about animals but still keeps younger ones interested. Very good buy.,1421366400,,270,4.211538461538462
