8469700,5,B005F7J7A2,"Toradora is a ""love it or hate it"" kind of TV series.  One guy is caught by the problem of liking one girl and winds up conspiring with another girl to trade off help--  Ryuji (the dragon) and Taiga (the tiger) try to help each other develop a romantic relationship with the person they desire.  Palm Top Tiger Taiga is tiny, but has real teeth, and she is going after this one boy in her class, but she freezes and glitches when she tries, too.  Ryuji is a Dragon inside, but a dragon who finds cooking, cleaning, and housework to be very fulfilling, and he cannot quite make the extra step to put forth his feelings with his classmate, either.  The Tiger can help the Dragon, and the Dragon can help the Tiger, even if both seem to make more errors than correct moves, they are there for each other.

It is actually intelligently written, and uses the character appearances to play against expectations, and of course, nothing works out the way you think it will..

And I swear I went to class with some of those characters.",1524614400,,1026,4.425531914893617
