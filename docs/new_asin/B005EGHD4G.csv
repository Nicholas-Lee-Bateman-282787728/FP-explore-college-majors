8468202,1,B005EGHD4G,"The recording is scratchy and blurry.  The audio is poor and muffled, rarely factual, full of tabloid crap and pointless information.  More about Mark Ronson than Amy.  Don't waste your money.",1359244800,3,192,5.129032258064516
8468203,1,B005EGHD4G,"I most certainly have to agree with the last reviewer of this pathetic piece of junk. PLEASE..DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PURCHASE OF THIS ITEM !!  Out of all of the other much better Amy Winehouse video / documentaries of such a great artist, this is absolutely appalling..no if's and's or but's..hands down the worst. As stated, nothing that you cannot view on Youtube. The producers of this should be made to take it off the shelves for sale and compensate all the buyers of this disc. Better still, they should be made to donate all of the profits made from this to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. R. I . P. Amy, you will be missed by millions and remembered to future generations.",1329177600,4,686,4.488
8468204,1,B005EGHD4G,"There is nothing on here you cannot get off of YouTube.  THis was a waste of money.
The last part is nothing more that a rolling screen (ala Star Wars) of a Biography that is common knowledge.
Nothing new here.",1323216000,9,210,4.25
