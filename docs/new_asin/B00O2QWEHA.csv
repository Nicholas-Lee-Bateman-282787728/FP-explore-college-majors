6708096,4,B00O2QWEHA,"Any of you who have read my reviews on this type of film, know that I'm not too kind.  They usually have no originality, Swiss Cheese for a script, actors who can't walk and chew gum at the same time, and production qualities leave a lot to be desired.  I caught this one on PPV last evening--and boy was I glad I did!

Another ""ghost hunter crew"" head to the ominous Sanatorium to spend a ghoulishly scary evening and prove to their viewing audience that ghosts do exist.  Heard that plot before?  Yeah; I know.  BUT, I found this particular production way above its other rivals in this genre.  In this movie, it's what you DON'T see, what you THINK you see, and what you hear that scares the bejesus out of you!  I thought the acting was top-notch.  I cared about all the characters, even the d*ck that gets on everyone's nerves from the beginning of the film.

After Dark films have released some of my favorite horror CDs, and I'm certainly glad to see them back in action.  This movie is rated R for pervasively foul language and violence.  I will advise you now that if you're looking for non-stop gore, you need to pass on this one.  If you're looking for decent scares that will have you turning your lights on, I say go for it!  This one did not miss a 5-star rating (from me) by much.

Enjoy!",1419292800,17,1303,4.3264462809917354
6708107,5,B00O2QWEHA,"Although the movie was slow at the start, it rapidly gained momentum as each investigator fell victim to a violent demise. With a strong interest in the paranormal myself, I found the special effects especially intriguing. In actual cases where spirit forms appear as light orbs when filmed, I found myself asking how the producers managed to reproduce the orbs with such accuracy so close to actual phenomenon. I have photographed orbs myself and must compliment the movie for accuracy on this aspect. The rest of the movie is very well done and worth adding to collections",1447200000,2,574,4.927835051546392

6708109,2,B00O2QWEHA,"If you're going by the creepy cover, don't.  It is nowhere in the movie.  This was just a really bad knockoff of the really good movie ""Grave Encounters"".  (But avoid Grave Encounters 2.)  Two girls, 3 guys, at a ""haunted TB sanatorium"", which just happens to be their 100th episode.  Oh, did I mention they have a t.v. show about the paranormal.  That's a new one.  I don't think I spoil anything by saying it begins by the blonde girl discovering  she's pregnant.  Don't worry, it doesn't go anywhere, I just figure that's where they are going with the cover.  And of course, for the first hour, nothing happens.  (It's only 90 minutes long.)  By the end, I guess they all ""belong"" to the sanatorium.  Although, it is really a nursing home, in 1974 it became Hillcrest Nursing Home (which is weird because I use to work at a Hillcrest Nursing Home.)  I just mention that, because the ""caretaker"" mentions it 3 times.  For what purpose?  It doesn't factor in to the story at all.  Poor editing, poor sound; poor acting.  I love movies like this, so it takes a lot to make me diss this type of movie.  But ""Sanatorium"" has a lot to diss about.  Rent it from Netflix, don't waste your money paying money to watch.",1437004800,3,1212,4.447488584474886

6708112,2,B00O2QWEHA,"Over half of this movie seems to consist of nothing but people bumping & banging into $#!T, jumping from out of nowhere hollering, and making all sorts of random loud racket: there was so much crashing into things going on that I felt as though I was watching the supernatural version of ""THE NAKED GUN."" Throw into that mix a bunch of assholios who can't seem to take their business as ""paranormal investigators"" for a (somehow) successful TV series seriously 75% of the time, and who are constantly casting suspicion on their colleagues the remaining 25% of the time, compound that with the fact that absolutely nothing of any significance happens throughout the movie until about the last ten minutes of the story which even then is so over-the-top to make it all quite laughable, and what you've ended up with is another justifiable excuse for screaming at the top of your lungs, ""Stop giving hand-held night vision equipped cameras to talentless wannabees hoping to cash in on the P.O.V./""found-footage"" gravy train!

My initial reaction while sitting through this movie was: ""I'm just re-watching 'HAUNTING OF CELLBLOCK 11' set in an abandoned nursing home ne sanatorium instead of in an abandoned prison, only done entirely from '1st-person' perspectives,"" but so much of the movie was wasted on all the annoyingly irritating eardrum-shattering fake ""Boo!"" moments that by the time anything of any real substance started happening I was already almost completely removed from trying to engage myself in the story or caring at all about the characters and/or their (ahem) ""dreadful"" situation.

I am something of a fan of these type of movies, but only when they're done well and are *remotely* believable, even if they are going to play it over-the-top: unfortunately, ""SANATORIUM"" is one of those from among a long list that hit all the wrong marks on all levels.",1423094400,,1871,4.993589743589744
6708113,5,B00O2QWEHA,Love this. Movies rarely freak me out... This one is extra creepy. I swear I saw things that were not there... Its the kind of movie to watch over again... And the end? Seriously??? Perfect.,1422230400,,190,4.457142857142857
6708114,4,B00O2QWEHA,"While it's not as good as i hoped it would be, Sanatorium is a well made movie. The story revolves around a film crew that investigates paranormal activity. Sound familier? Even though it takes awhile to get going, The last half is worth it. Sanatorium is definately worth viewing. 7/10 Thanx for reading.",1421107200,3,305,4.773584905660377

8681731,5,B00O2QWEHA,"I was highly impressed. The plot has been used so many times, but this was produced VERY well, the actors/actresses were great (and the characters were well ""written""), and I actually had to sleep with all my lights on after watching!!!! It's not often a ""horror"" flick can do that to me :-D  I truly hope there will be a sequel to this movie!!",1499385600,,344,4.375

8681733,3,B00O2QWEHA,"The plot is hackneyed.  The acting fails to convey a 'found footage' feel.  The film relies heavily on cheat jump scares.

Spoiler Alert!
A main character learns she is pregnant in the beginning of the film.  The basic theme of the film is possession and children.  I was expecting this to be a 'last-girl-standing' film where the baby is born possessed but no.  She dies.  The pregnancy side story never amounts to anything.

There is only one black character and he dies.  At least not first.

A couple has sex but they are married but they both get killed anyway.  I guess sex is sex to the dead.

Ghosts generate heat but did not burn to death .  WTF?

Rent, don't buy.",1488844800,,673,4.409836065573771
