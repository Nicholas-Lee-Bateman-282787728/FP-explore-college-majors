858955,5,630440123X,"herbie movies are always great clean entertainment for kids

all of my kids age 4 to 14 enjoy herbie movies",1127088000,,107,4.35
858956,2,630440123X,"Like many sequels, the writers of this one were unable to come up with a new plot idea, so they basically re-hashed the original. Ken Berry takes the Dean Jones role, Stephanie Powers takes the Michelle Lee role, the demise of the firehouse replaces the demise of Herbie, etc, etc. Also like many sequels, the result was poor at best. While it had its moments [the parade of Beetles], for the most part, ""Herbie Rides Again"" seemed to try to hard to be clever...and as a result, fails.
As for the transfer...I couldn't help but notice how ""tight"" all the scenes with the actors seemed to be...especially the ones inside Herbie. The reason? It appears this movie was filmed in 1.66:1 ratio...and Disney, in its usual infinite wisdom, has trimmed information from the picture to make it fit a 16x9 screen. Geez...even Disney's widescreen movies cut out part of the picture. These guy are just clueless, aren't they?
The sound seemed a little off to me as well, with the music sometimes overwhelming the dialogue.
All that being said, my recommendation is to buy ""The Love Bug"" [which has an overall excellent transfer, with the exception of one out-of-focus scene in Chinatown], and forget all the sequels.",1086652800,9,1204,4.821256038647343
858957,2,630440123X,"My two year old loves Herbie, so we rented this to give us all a break. Now we are paying for it! The villian in this movie rants, raves, screams, and bosses everyone around conitinuously. Perhaps it is coincidence, but our mild-mannered son has become a mini-version of this tryant. After two weeks, he is finally returning to normal. I would not recommend showing this movie to suggestible children. It is difficult to find live-action, non-violent movies with good role-model characters. Stick with ""The Love Bug.""",1086048000,6,517,5.023255813953488
858958,5,630440123X,"Alonzo Hawk has made his fortune by destroying old buildings and putting new office buildings and shopping centers in their place.  His latest project is to build the world's tallest skyscraper in San Francisco.  Unfortunately for him, one widow refuses to sell the little firehouse she's lived in since the day she got married.  Even more unfortunately, she's keeping Herbie for her nephew, and Herbie has decided to protect her at all costs.  But what can a VW Bug do against a man who will stop at nothing to destroy the firehouse?
This was the first sequel to the huge hit, THE LOVE BUG.  Released 6 years after the original, none of the human cast returned.  Only the car is around to reprise his roll.  Stirring clear of racecar driving completely for this go around, the plot focuses solely on the tug of war over the firehouse.  The plot itself is silly, with Herbie doing such things as driving the cable of the Golden Gate Bridge and swimming.  Still, if you're in the mood for improbably fun, these movies are your ticket.  The cast, lead by Helen Hayes, does a fine job keeping the storyline believable fantasy.  And, of course, there's the romantic sub-plot just to add a little more tension.
I was really impressed by the Special Edition treatment that THE LOVE BUG received last year and was hoping for more of the same.  Unfortunately, this is a movie only edition.  This movie is presented in widescreen and full surround, however.  The picture looks sharp with some dust and grain debris showing it's age.  It sounds nice as well, although the movie won't give your surround sound a chance to truly shine.  Then again, considering when the movie came out, that's not too different from the original source.
Despite the lack of special features, it's nice to have this fun film on DVD.  I've been a fan of Herbie for as long as I can remember, and these films will always hold a special place in my heart.",1084060800,6,1922,4.622418879056047
858959,2,630440123X,"Disney is NOT adding any features whatsoever for the Herbie, the Love Bug sequels.  As a dedicated fan of the star car, I have discovered that so far ONLY Herbie Rides Again will be in Widescreen.  The only other thing that could possibly be of any good quality within these discs would be a remastering of the picture and sound.  Unless you've given up using your VCR or you are a collector, don't waste your time purchasing the Herbie sequels.

  An interesting thing here is the mean Man in this movie happens to be related to a good Man who falls in love with the daughter of the Old Woman who now owns the Car. There is only one very mild race in this film and not a bunch of races like in The Love Bug and Herbie goes to Monte Carlo.
  This is a classic movie and Herbie is so awesome. Herbie does interesting things like Rides on tall Buildings and gets chased by bad people who where sent by the Villain to run that Old Lady out of her house.",1069718400,,751,3.825806451612903

When you do that, the movie is a good movie that drives home the same message as the original:  Persevere.  Don't give up even in the face of adversity.  It doesn't have the same charm as the original but it has it's own charm.  I enjoyed this movie very much, but for it's own merits, not because it was a duplicate of the first.",1055462400,,479,4.042553191489362

859198,5,630440123X,"Six years after the original ""Love Bug,"" Disney proved that sequels don't always have to be inferior to the original.  We find the little Volkswagen retired from racing (owner Jim Douglas is ""in Europe racing European cars"") and living with Mrs. Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), the widow of Captain Steinmetz (""the hero of the Great Fire"") and aunt of Tennessee (who ""had to go to Nepal because his guru got sick""), who's also holding down the old fire station in which Jim and Tennessee lived.  Also resident is Old 22, a junked cable car Herbie found in someone's yard, and a mechanical piano (name unknown) that spontaneously plays tunes appropriate to the occasion--both of them, like Herbie himself, sentient--and Nicole (Stefanie Powers), an airline stewardess (still so called in the 1970's) who's been rendered homeless after her building, just across the street, was razed by a construction-and-development company owned by Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn)--yes, Alonzo Hawk from ""The Absent-Minded Professor,"" who in 13 years apparently got out of jail (if he went) and moved on to bigger and better things.  In fact, the only building still standing in the neighborhood is the firehouse--and Hawk is determined to get it by hook or by crook, so he can erect a giant double skyscraper on the site.  Now Hawk's nephew, Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry), fresh out of law school, arrives in San Francisco, entirely innocent of his uncle's true character, and is quickly maneuvered by Hawk into trying to persuade Mrs. S. to sell the station.  He immediately finds himself given a full-armed slap across the face by Nicole--and then introduced to some of Herbie's more interesting abilities.  Before long he's a converted believer in the little car--and on the run from Uncle Alonzo, who doesn't forgive incompetence.  A wholesale (and entirely illegal) seizure of Mrs. Steinmetz's possessions out of the firehouse leads to a nighttime burglary of his premises by Willoughby and the two women, which in turn leads to an encounter with an Oregon rancher named Judson (John McIntire), who's quite taken with Tennessee's aunt.  But Mrs. S. isn't particularly forgiving either--which, in turn, leads to a fog-shrouded assault on the firehouse by Hawk and a conclave of construction machinery.  Now indeed Herbie must ride to the rescue--at the head of a pack of other Volkswagens.

There's a good bit of slapstick-type humor in this movie, which I don't ordinarily like, but it seems somehow better handled and less inappropriate than is often the case.  Berry and Hayes are especially good in their parts, playing straight men to the whole fantastic concept of living machinery.  I hadn't expected a lot from this movie, and was pleasantly surprised to find myself wrong.",1437004800,,2760,5.108888888888889

It's fun to see Herbie again and Helen Hayes is lovely, but I miss Dean Jones, Michelle Lee, and Buddy Hackett.  Ken Berry is okay, but he's no Dean Jones.  The plot involves Keenan Wynn's ubiquitous Alonzo Hawk trying to cheat or steal Helen Hayes's firehouse home from her so that he can erect another skyscraper.  Needless to say, Herbie and friends thwart the evil machinations, with plenty of hijinks and tomfoolery in the process.  This is the only worthwhile ""Love Bug"" sequel, and if you love ""The Love Bug"", I think you'll like ""Herbie Rides Again"".",1424304000,,724,4.714285714285714

859459,4,630440123X,"Set several years after THE LOVE BUG, HERBIE RIDES AGAIN is somewhat unusual for a Herbie movie in that it doesnt involve racing. Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) currently isn't using Herbie in racing events and has left him with Mrs. Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), an aunt of Douglas mechanic in the first movie, Tennesse Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett). Herbie watches out for Mrs. Steinmetz and she watches out for him. A young flight attendant, Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers) is also staying with Mrs. Steinmetz. Meanwhile, Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is a major real estate developer and the only thing standing between him and his new project is Mrs. Steinmetz firehouse home. Hawk sends his nephew, Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) to take care of things. Just out of law school, Willoughby does the best he can to get the little old lady to sell, but she won't have it. Eventually, Willoughby understands why Mrs. Steinmetz won't sell. He also becomes smitten with Nicole and eventually joins their side of the struggle against his uncle.

HERBE RIDES AGAIN is a bit more frivolous than THE LOVE BUG. There are a lot of silly antics that really don't have much to do with the plot (e.g. Herbie driving on the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge). Some of these jokes and gags are too forced and don't flow naturally.
Also, in terms of plot, the plot for HERBIE RIDES AGAIN isn't as strong as THE LOVE BUG. Despite these faults, HERBIE RIDES AGAIN is a fun and enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed THE LOVE BUG, youll enjoy seeing HERBIE RIDES AGAIN. Its a fun family film and a must see movie for any Herbie fan.",1394064000,,1592,4.685714285714286

859462,5,630440123X,"Helen Hayes is a delight to watch under any circumstance.
The main difference between this sequel and the original are the racing scenes (repeated here only in a dream sequence that Herbie has).  Otherwise, the firehouse is back and under threat from a new arch-arch villain Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn).  And there's a new couple reprising the same romance element.  And of course, there's Herbie in retirement, now just a means of taking people shopping or on dates.  He eventually gets to play the hero.  He also gets a scene on the beach where he chases seagulls as a dog would.  Some of the humor falters when you realize the villain has absolutely no scruples and if it means killing an elderly couple in the bargain, so be it.
Ken Berry is a poor substitute for Dean Jones but Stefanie Powers does quite well in the compulsory girlfriend role akin to Michele Lee's character in the first film.  John McIntire provides some gallantry as a cowboy/would be suitor for Helen Hayes.  Keenan Wynn is just mean-mean-mean (seriously, no one can do MEAN quite like Keenan Wynn).
A fun movie all around and my favorite of the series because of the lack of racing sequences.",1375920000,,1167,4.686274509803922

859664,4,630440123X,"Probably the only amazing thing about this sequel is that it took so long before Disney released it.  ""The Love Bug"" became a big hit for Disney, and for many years after the movie many children called all Beetles Herbie.  This movie trades Dean Jones as Jim Douglas and Buddy Hackett as Tennessee Steinmetz for Helen Hayes as Mrs. Steinmetz (yes, she is related to Tennessee), Stefanie Powers as flight attendant Nicole Harris, and Ken Berry as newly minted lawyer Willoughby Whitfield.

The plot is quite different from the original.  Herbie is no longer a race car, but lives a quiet life taking care of Mrs. Steinmetz.  Nicole Harris also helps take care of Mrs. Steinmetz, doing so in a very assertive way throughout the movie.  We learn very early in the movie that Alonzo Hawk, who also appeared in ""The Absent Minded Professor"" and ""Son of Flubber,"" has his eye on the fire house where Mrs. Steinmetz lives.  However, Mrs. Steinmetz is not in the mood to leave her home, which contains many memories of her late spouse.

Much of this movie involves a lot of silliness.  Herbie and Mrs. Steinmetz manage to get up to Alonzo Hawk's office on a window washer, with predicable mayhem.  Herbie takes a trip on the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Herbie also manages to make a fool of Alonzo Hawk when he attempts to drive Herbie.  However, all of these fun little incidents are mere preludes to the last portion of this movie where Disney finally stops fooling around and lets loose.

Mr. Hawk decides to take all of Mrs. Steinmetz's possessions in an attempt to force Mrs. Steinmetz from the fire house.  Nicole and Willoughby locate the furniture and take it all back, but only after some of the best scenes in the movie.  This movie seems to go faster and faster from this point forward.  I will let a viewer find out for themselves how this one ends.

This movie is less fun than ""The Love Bug.""  There are too many contrived scenes and the humor is more forced.  However, a lot of the Herbie magic remains.  When the movie finally allows Herbie to take the lead this movie has its best, and funniest, moments.  The last third of this movie is particularly joyful and I recommend it for fans of the first movie.

I recommended ""The Love Bug"" as a family movie suitable for all members of the family.  ""Herbie Rides Again"" is also a family movie, but this movie may be less suitable for the youngest members of the family.  Alonzo Hawk makes a great villain; in fact, he steals nearly all his scenes, but may also become an inadvertent role model for very young children.  I would think that most children by the age of 6 or 7 years old will find this movie funny and enjoyable.

I think fans of Helen Hayes and Stefanie Powers will also enjoy this movie.  Helen Hayes is very natural in her role, even when the scenes are absurd.  Stefanie Powers takes everything in stride and is the most dynamic person in the movie after Alonzo Hawk.

The Love Bug franchise has seen its share of ups and downs over the years.  This movie remains one of the better entries in the series and is worth a couple of viewings, particularly if you are a fan of the original.  Pull in the kids, the spouse and make this one a family affair.

859665,4,630440123X,"Five years after Herbie the Volkswagen bug made his big-screen debut in Disney's legendary hit film, ""The Love Bug,"" the little racecar returns with the lovable 1974 comedy, ""Herbie Rides Again!"" This time around, Herbie is left in the care of Tennessee Steinmetz's kindly, old, widow aunt, played by Helen Hayes, who lives in the same familiar firehouse from the original film. Disney staple Dean Jones and sidekick Buddy Hackett are nowhere to be seen this time around. Dean's character, Jim Douglas, has gone off to Europe to race in European cars, while Tennessee has rushed off to Tibet to care for his ailing guru. Instead, we have the always charmingly dimwitted Ken Berry (great for us ""Mama's Family"" fans!), who is sent by his greedy and filthy rich developer uncle, Alonzo Hawk (the fantastically wicked Keenan Wynn), to extract old-lady Steinmetz so that the firehouse can be torn down and replaced by a shopping mall. Problem is, Mrs. Steinmetz has no intention of leaving her beloved home where she married fireman Mr. Steinmetz and has lived all these years.  She shares the place with Herbie the VW, an antique music machine, an old cable-car called Number 22, and a lovely stewardess named Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers) who quickly shows Berry's character, Willoughby, how she feels about Mr. Hawk and his associates. Once Nicole has explained to Willoughby what his uncle is really like, the two quickly fall in love (with Herbie's help, of course) and Willoughby immediately leaves his new job as a lawyer for Hawk Industries. Their troubles are not over that easily, however. Alonzo Hawk is determined to take down the old firehouse, even though he doesn't even own the land yet! He decides to employ harassment tactics, starting with stealing the little car that drives Mrs. Steinmetz everywhere and protects her constantly, Herbie! The film kicks the slapstick humor and wild stunts up a notch when Herbie, making his daily rounds with Mrs. Steinmetz, must repeatedly outwit and outdrive Alonzo and his goons, Helen Hayes playing the Mr. Magoo part perfectly all the while. But she's not as out of tune as she seems. When Mrs. Steinmetz decides to play tough, she plays tough, with Herbie's help that is, not to mention the help of her new cowboy suitor, Mr. Judson (John McIntire), along with Nicole, Willoughby, and an army of VW bugs!

""Herbie Rides Again"" was the first in a still flourishing line of sequels to the Disney phenomenon, ""The Love Bug."" Directed by the same fantastic Disney Legend who helmed the original, Robert Stevenson, this is no mere rehash of the first! While the original film still reigns superior to the other offerings, the follow-ups are nevertheless fantastic! ""Herbie Rides Again"" features an all new story, completely off the racetrack, and plenty of car-chases loaded with some of Herbie's most legendary stunts, such as driving up the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge, driving around on the ledge of a skyscraper, and surfing in the Pacific Ocean! While it lacks a bit of that Walt Disney touch (Walt past away even before the first Herbie film was released, though he did have a hand in it), the film stays true to the original with the same great music, another excellent cast, and plenty of Herbie magic! It is truly `70's Disney, but not everyone considers that a bad thing. ""Herbie Rides Again"" is all about visual family comedy and fun, and in that it excels! The movie is presented in widescreen on this DVD release, though some have stated that it is not the true widescreen, and while the picture looks scores better than some other Disney DVDs, like ""Blackbeard's Ghost,"" it doesn't look perfect. There are also no bonus features to be found, but if you really want some, all the Herbie sequels up to the 1997 TV movie are mentioned from time to time on the bonus disc of the original 1969 classic DVD. That is a ""must-own"" 2-disc set for any Herbie fan! In fact, I really recommend the boxed set of all 4 classic Herbie films, along with ""The Love Bug"" TV movie on VHS and the DVD release of ""Herbie: Fully Loaded!"" Both of those last two are often referred to as remakes, even by Disney Archivists! It annoys me every time I hear it! They are both sequels, despite the TV movie's title and the fact that it is completely disregarded by ""Fully Loaded."" Anyway, all are great films in their own way, and ""Fully Loaded"" is nearly as great as the original! If you love Herbie, watch for my other reviews and pick `em all up!",1140739200,,4492,4.7650834403080875
