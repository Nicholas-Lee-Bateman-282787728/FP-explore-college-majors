7797655,3,1572521120,"An interesting movie about the life of immigrants living in a strange land. Although the story takes place in France and North Africa the theme is universal and applies to immigrants everywhere. The story evolves primarily around the lives of two brothers who try to survive in the urban jungle. The paths they take are different and the strength of family ties are needed to overcome the adversity the brothers encounter. The portrayl of the strong family that crosses several generations gives interesting insight into the problems of different values and perceptions of different age groups living under one roof. This is a good movie to understand a cultural phenomenon that takes place world wide. Although based on from what others have said in their reviews, it is very accurate for area specific realism. There is some violence but tame by comparison to American ""gangsta"" movies. Very interesting slice of life abroad.",979689600,4,927,5.105263157894737
