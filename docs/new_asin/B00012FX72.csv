8005544,1,B00012FX72,"this show makes me sick. its just aweful. the characters are so annoying i cant watch them for more than eleven seconds or else i would get an aneurism. whoever thought it was a good idea to make this should be put in jail. and as if the characters weren't enough, the plot is so bad it offends me. i think ive said enough by now about this show, so i will leave you, the reader, off with one last thought: please don't buy this. for the love of everything that is sacred, don't buy this.",1081641600,3,488,4.09375
8005545,3,B00012FX72,"At the end of volume one a second Gundam (Zero the Winged Knight) had shown up to challenge the Dark Axis, aiding Captain in stopping their latest attempt at conquering Neotopia. This news reaches the Commander and he's not pleased. Wheras Captain was just viewed as a minor annoyance, the prospect of him teaming up with another could represent a major threat to their plans. The Dark Axis other problem is that their leaders are glory hogs, as Zapper and Grappler proved on their last mission. Afraid of punishment from the Commander, the two begrudgingly agree to work togethor. Their small amount of teamwork just manages to give them the edge over the bickering Zero and Captain and the 2 Gundams are captured. With some help from Shute they manage to escape and Zero realises that maybe he should ally with them.
With this fourth loss, the Commander brings in a third general- Destroyer Dom, a weapon loving maniac who will target friend and foe alike. When even the duo of Zero and Captain seem to be no match for him all looks lost until a blazing samurai comes riding out of a dimensional portal...
This second disc follows the same basic outline as the first. Captain and Shute try to win over the Gundams of other dimensions whilst trying to keep Neotopia safe from the increasingly tougher forces of the Dark Axis. As a G Gundam fan, the new character of Bakunetsumaru is one of my personal favourites. A samurai-styled version of the Shining Gundam with it's pilots attitude, Baku is desperate to return to his homeland of Ark to defend it from the Dark Axis forces threatening it. Shute's role in the fight becomes official in this disc. The SDG have recognized that he is needed to activate Captain's Soul Drive and thus recruit him as Captain's partner. You have to wonder about a group like this being willing to put a child in direct danger, but then its really not a serious show.
We're also introduced to two new citizens of Neotopia- Dr Bell Wood and Mayor Margaret Gathermoon. Both are rather dissapointing. Bell is a stereotype of black people who looks like he came off the set of HammerMan and the Mayor is there to fill the show's fanservice quota, as shown by her huge chest.
The best new addition by far is the Zako Zako Hour. Appearing at the end of episodes from 6 onwards, these segments allow the loveable Zako soldiers to break the fourth wall and provide the viewer with info and a few laughs.
This disc basically marks the end of the set-up stage for the show. All of the central characters have been introduced and we begin moving on with the plot.",1080691200,4,2584,4.6073752711496745
8005546,5,B00012FX72,"SD Gundam is the best Gundam show in the series! It was American made, and features Gundams,except mini-sized. If you haven't seen it,it comes on everyday on Cartoon Network on Toonami. This DVD is worth buying!",1072742400,4,211,4.888888888888889
