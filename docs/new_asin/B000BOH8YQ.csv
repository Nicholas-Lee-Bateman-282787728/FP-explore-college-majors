2432112,5,B000BOH8YQ,"At long last ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" gets its third season pumping. Hopefully Fox will keep cranking them out, because ironically (unlike most shows), ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" got better each season vs. worse. By the time the fourth season hit, more laughs and one-liners were being thrown at us. And thank God for Betty White, who immortalized Sue Ann Nivens as the bitchy, happy homemaker. This is one of the best comedies of all time. And truly deservant of its 29 Emmy wins. Season 3 includes ""Its Whether You Win or Lose"" which sadly, didn't earn Gavin MaCleuad an Emmy nomination- and he's the only principal cast member never to win or be nominated. It also includes ""Put on a Happy Face"", one of Mary Tyler Moore's five best performances on the show.",1132704000,12,765,4.632352941176471
2432113,5,B000BOH8YQ,"What good news!  The Mary Tyler Moore show was one of the highest quality sitcoms produced during the past 34 years, and it has astonished me that it has taken so long for these shows (barring Season 1) to be released on DVD.  With all of the absolute junk out there being released (I guess it's a matter of taste, which doesn't speak too highly of our culture :-)), I simply can't believe all of the MTM seasons aren't out yet.  Both Seasons 1 and 2 contain such good material, and Season 3 promises to be just as enjoyable.  If you like The MTM Show, buy all three seasons (great discounts on Seasons 1 & 2 at Amazon).  Let's get Season 4 out before too long!",1129593600,40,661,4.214285714285714
2432114,5,B000BOH8YQ,"******** UPDATED REVIEW ********
**** EDITED ON JANUARY 19, 2006 ****

The sensational and laugh-filled third season of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" hit DVD in an attractive 3-Disc set from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on January 17th, 2006, only six months after Season 2 was released (not bad at all, especially when compared to the 34-month wait MTM fans had between the Season-One and Season-Two DVD releases).

Season 3 of TMTMS (originally seen on CBS-TV during the 1972-1973 television campaign) has so many highly-memorable episodes amongst its 24-show roster -- such as: ""My Brother's Keeper"", ""Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis To New York"", ""Operation: Lou"", ""You've Got A Friend"", and the hilarious ""Put On A Happy Face"".

The ""Happy Face"" episode has Mary suffering from a variety of ailments, injuries, and afflictions just prior to having to go to the annual ""Teddy Awards"" banquet. It's one of my all-time favorite MTM installments. I'd recommend freeze-framing that episode at the 9:36 point in the program for a funny ""Mary In Mid-Air"" moment. I only wish I were Lou Grant in that particular scene. :)

I never fail to be amazed at how well this TV series holds up over time. Every single one of these third-year episodes, in my opinion, seems utterly perfect (both script-wise and picture quality-wise on these DVDs...gorgeous color and overall video quality).

Just a few sample episodes from Season 3 reveal the exquisite storylines, characters, relationships, and friendships that I'm literally envious of with each viewing -- ""You've Got A Friend"" and ""The Courtship Of Mary's Father's Daughter"" (both co-starring the great Bill Quinn as Mary's dad) are two such examples. Beautiful shows. Wonderfully written and brilliantly acted, with just the right dose of sentiment mixed in with the humor. Like when Mary's dad bandages the wrong finger after Mary cuts herself in ""You've Got A Friend"". One of the best scenes ever done in the whole series.

And ""Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis To New York"" is another winner from Disc #2 of this collection, exemplifying what the word ""friendship"" really means.

I want to watch them all again. And will...very soon, thanks to this excellent DVD set from Fox Home Entertainment.

And also remember to keep your ears perked for ""The MTM Honker"" (aka, show executive James L. Brooks). Brooks likes to occasionally let loose from behind the cameras with the funniest doggone laugh I've ever heard (which sounds more like a ""honk"" to me). I love it when he lets fly with one unexpectedly. He gets off one or two in the ""Happy Face"" episode, and many other eps. as well. (And if you have any videos of Mary's spin-off series, ""Rhoda"", you can hear James honkin' up a storm throughout many of those shows too. He's a riot all by himself, IMO.)

Also in the ""Happy Face"" show, listen for another of the great lines of dialogue that the MTM writers regularly give to Rhoda (played to a tee by Valerie Harper):

MARY -- ""Rhoda, chocolate solves nothing.""
RHODA -- ""No, no -- cottage cheese solves nothing; chocolate can do it all.""

~ Honk, honk! ~ :-)

Like the first two full-season DVD sets of this always-delightful TV series, the complete third-season collection sparkles brightly in the A/V departments. The video looks crisp and clean, with warm colors, and the Dolby Digital (mono) audio sounds just fine. No complaints from this writer whatsoever.

The bright, bold colors that can be found in this TV series are really brought to the forefront during the scenes which take place in Rhoda's apartment. That lady lives in a veritable rainbow of color up above Mary's place on ""North Weatherly"" in Minneapolis. And those many hues look fabulous on these Digital Discs too. As does the show's star, Mary Tyler Moore. Mary looks positively stunning throughout this third season. Wow! :-)

But unlike the two earlier MTM DVD boxed sets, this third installment lacks any special bonus supplements. But I kind of figured that would be the case many months ago even before it came out. The first two seasonal sets contained quite a lot of extra material, and there just might not be a whole lot left to dig up in the ""bonus"" department. (Although a few of the original CBS-TV promo clips would have been nice. But even without a single bonus item, this set is a required purchase for fans of TMTMS and fans of Mary Tyler Moore herself.)

The twenty-four shows (8 per disc) in this boxed set, as far as I can determine, are all complete and uncut episodes. I've performed a running-time check for each of the eight programs on Disc 1, and those shows have an average run time of 25:35. That stat certainly favors the use of the word ""uncut"" for sure! Here are the exact run times for those eight shows (you'll note a consistent trend):

""The Good-Time News"" -- 25:34.
""What Is Mary Richards Really Like?"" -- 25:31.
""Who's In Charge Here?"" -- 25:36.
""Enter Rhoda's Parents"" -- 25:35.
""It's Whether You Win Or Lose"" -- 25:35.
""Rhoda The Beautiful"" -- 25:36.
""Just Around The Corner"" -- 25:36.
""But Seriously, Folks"" -- 25:36.

A nice addition to this collection that many DVD buyers will appreciate is the inclusion of a ""Play All"" option on each of the three discs. Seasons 1 and 2 have no such marathon-playing choice. (Good job, Fox!)

The static and music-free DVD Menus have a different look to them vs. the previous two MTM sets, with Season Three featuring a faster response time when a Menu selection is made too. The previous sets have a short built-in ""delay"" when moving around the Menu system. There is a slight delay when accessing exactly half of the episodes in this third-season set (the last 4 episodes on each disc to be precise, which I imagine represents the shows on Layer #2 of each DVD), but it seems to me as though it's less of a delay that the earlier seasons.

I like the Menus very much; there are Sub-Menus for ""Language Selection"" and ""Scene Selection"" (with all text written out in the familiar ""MTM"" type font, featuring that unique mix of both lower-case and capital letters).

I cannot figure out, however, why Fox made these Season-Three Menus all ""anamorphic"" in nature. But they did. Which is a bit odd, because the episodes themselves, of course, are not anamorphically-enhanced (because they don't need to be, being Full-Frame 4x3 material in the first place). This is not an uncommon occurrence amongst DVD products though. But it is slightly irritating, because IMO a DVD for a Full-Frame program should maintain a Full-Frame (i.e., non-anamorphic) profile throughout its presentation, including the Menu structure.

The DVD packaging here is identical in style to that of the Season-Two set, with three plastic thin/slim cases utilized to hold the three single-sided discs. The three plastic cases slide into an open-ended outer cardboard carton (a slipcase box). Nothing fancy here; it's very simple and utilitarian, but it's a nice-looking and classy package just the same. (Although the lack of any official ""DVD-Video"" logo on the spine of the outer box seems a tad odd to me. The Season-Two set doesn't have any such ""DVD"" logo on its spine either. But the first-season set does have the logo. No big deal, of course. It's just something I always expect to see on the spines of virtually all DVD packages. Oh well.)

When I first saw the box-cover photo of Mary for this set I wasn't too thrilled with the look of it. It seems a bit awkward and unnatural-looking, with Mary seemingly sitting on thin air. But when I got the boxed set in my hands, the cover art started to grow on me. Now I kind of like it. (Heck, it's the lovely MTM after all, so it can't possibly be that bad.) ;)

The same front-of-the-box picture of Mary also adorns each of the three plastic inner cases as well. And there's a terrific (and funny) photo of Mary and Ted Knight (""Ted Baxter"") on the back of the box.

Overall, I'm very impressed with this third-year Mary set, despite no bonus stuff being included. What especially pleases me about this particular collection is the fact that 20th Century Fox didn't just give up on the MTM Show following what I heard were disappointing sales for the first-season set. Since Fox already had Season #2 ""in the can"" (or close to it) when they released Season 1 in September 2002, it seemed logical to assume that that second set would also hit the market eventually too (which it did, albeit after a very long wait).

But Season Three was a different matter. I suppose Fox could have just tossed aside any thoughts of future MTM releases following those poor S.1 profits. But they didn't abandon Mary, and I, for one, am grateful for that decision. And not only didn't they abandon this classic TV series, they didn't cut corners on video quality for S.3 either. The PQ is every bit as good as the first two season sets. Plus, Fox even saw fit to improve some things over the previous DVD sets -- such as adding the Play-All feature and revising the Menu system to make it a bit more user-friendly (and faster). Hats off to the Fox folks!

A few more stats and loose ends re. this MTM-3 set:

VIDEO -- Standard TV ratio of 1.33:1 (as originally aired).
AUDIO -- Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (English only). No Spanish tracks provided this time 'round.
SUBTITLES -- In English and Spanish.
CHAPTER BREAKS? -- Yes. 10 Chapters per episode.
""PLAY ALL"" INCLUDED? -- Yes.
INSERTS? -- No Episode Guide booklet is included. A multi-page ad for other Fox DVDs is in here though. (Some good series in there too.)
REGION CODE -- Region 1 (NTSC).

-----------------

EDIT (Jan. 22, 2006) --- I took note of a very sharp-eyed reviewer's comments re. a small edit that Fox has made to the last episode of this 3rd-Season DVD set (""Mary Richards And The Incredible Plant Lady""). And that reviewer certainly is correct (although I must confess I had not noticed the edit at all until reading that review about it).

Ted Baxter's words (as he hums a song to himself) have most certainly been dubbed over with other nondescript humming. That must certainly indicate that the rights to the song that Ted is mumbling weren't acquired (or couldn't be acquired) by Fox Home Entertainment for this DVD release. That's a shame, indeed, but not Earth-shaking either, IMO. The same thing occurred in the first-season DVD set during the excellent Christmas episode, when portions of ""White Christmas"" were edited off the DVD soundtrack. Again, that's not a good thing either...but not nearly calamitous enough to keep me from enjoying these ever-so-slightly altered episodes of this superb TV series.

BTW -- There is a disclaimer (of sorts) re. that ""Plant Lady"" episode printed on the back of the Disc #3 DVD case. Although it doesn't specifically mention anything about that episode being ""edited"" in any manner, it does give the impression that the show is subpar in some way. The exact words read: ""This episode has been restored to the best quality possible given the vintage source material"".

Obviously, via those words, they don't seem to be warning the public that the episode has been altered in some way. It's probably a reference to the slightly-wobbly video quality that occurs during a small portion of the final (epilogue) scene. The PQ isn't rock-solid during that scene, which might have prompted that disclaimer.

-----------------

It's a pretty safe bet that if you've got the first couple of seasons of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" on DVD, you shall desire to own this third-season pack too. It's filled with 24 great episodes from a TV series that earned its reputation as one of the best television programs of its era.

So, why not ask Mary (Season Three) for a date tonight? She can't possibly say no -- because you've got the Season-Three DVDs (and the remote control too). ;)",1129075200,172,11792,4.794972893050764

So I requested and received this stand-alone Season Three.  On to the negatives.....
The Season Three that comes in the complete series set has inserts for all three discs which keeps them safe.  But, the replacement stand-alone Season Three has all three discs piled on top of each other with no inserts for them.  Go figure.  Two plastic prongs were broken and the discs spilled out in shipping.

So many classic moments in each season, too. They don't make shows or actors this good anymore. Season  3 has several episodes which can be considered classic. The episode where Rhoda loses weight and enters a beauty contest, the one where Mary has to appear at an awards function and looks less-than-beautiful, and the one where Phyllis's brother visits are some of these. You really can't go wrong with any of the season sets from this series. They're all winners.",1395619200,,793,4.705035971223022

2432202,4,B000BOH8YQ,"Huge fan of the show - it's so cleverly written with some of the best TV characters ever.  Having seen Seasons 1, 2, 5, and 6 - I was looking forward with great anticipation for this TV series, which was scored for 9.99 - not the all-time lowest price on Amazon, but a good price nonetheless.  Item arrived quickly and packaged well - it's a normal-sized DVD case which holds 3 discs. Pretty simple format with no extra DVD features.

Compared to the prior seasons, and even the seasons thereafter, there seems to be a drop in the writing quality in many of the episodes.  Also, there's some noticeable voice-over work on a few of the episodes (i.e. a few lines re-done in the studio).  Overall, sound and image quality on the DVD transfer is good, and unlike the prior seasons' DVDs, you don't have to fish through multiple levels of menus to play an episode and then move onto the next.

Perhaps the stand-out star from the cast -- even with a drop in scriptwriting quality -- is Valerie Harper (Rhoda).  The episode where she describes her vision for the Christmas window decorations for the department store has got to be one of the best examples of physical comedy.  It's a good season to have in the movie library -- not my favorite season -- but a solid addition.  Looking forward to seeing Season 4, whenever the price drops to a fair price again :)",1368576000,2,1357,4.483739837398374

2432208,5,B000BOH8YQ,"Mary Richards is the girl next door - wholesome, pretty, hard-working, good daughter, good friend.  She's America's sweetheart.  That's why it was so effective when Mary, in season three, became the girl most likely to be liberated.  She didn't run around singing ""I am woman, hear me roar,"" but with every ""meow"" at the end of each episode, Mary came more and more into her own.

In the 1972/73 season, Mary's hair is shorter (and cuter).  Issues like equal pay, being assertive and being single & happy are brought into the script.  Mary says, ""I was surprised to find I'm not living my life in a constant search to get married.""  The beauty of all of this is none of it is the theme of any episode.  It's a mention here and a moment there, but the brilliant writing was able to flesh out characters in this way without beating us over the head with a message.  If liberation is part of the characters evolving in the changing times of the 1970s, then the constant was the number of classic shows this season turned out.

Season three has some of the funniest episodes ever on television.  Each character has at least one episode where they really shine.  In ""The Good Time News,"" Ted (Ted Knight) is at his nuttiest when he starts competing with Gordy to be the funny one on the news.  ""It's Whether You Win or Lose"" has Gavin MacLeod shining as Murray gets involved in a bet with Ted.  ""Rhoda the Beautiful"" features Rhoda's (Valerie Harper) insecurities as she enters a beauty contest.  I've watched this a zillion times over the years, and I still tear up at the end.  Also in this episode, Cloris Leachman as Phyllis has a priceless, scene-stealing bit where she sings.  Ed Asner is nothing short of genius in ""Lou's Place,"" where Lou buys a bar.  It's one of my favorite episodes of the entire series.  I love the reactions of Mary, Rhoda and the other patrons when he loses it and forces a sing-along.  ""Put on a Happy Face"" finds Mary having a very bad week.  MTM is perfection as everything goes wrong. Because of this episode, my mom and I refer to a bad day as a bump-on-your-hair kind of day.  Other moments of note:  one of the funniest blind/double dates ever in ""Romeo and Mary,"" Georgette (Georgia Engel) is introduced this season.

There are 24 episodes, many of them classics.  If I could give this season more than five stars, I would.",1332547200,,2356,4.513002364066194

2432236,4,B000BOH8YQ,"There was a time where people had a reason to stay home on a Saturday night, and in that time (1970 to 1977), CBS had a prime time lineup starting with All in the Family, M*A*S*H, MTM, and the original Bob Newhart Show.  Created by ""Your Show of Shows"" veterans like Norman Lear, Larry Gelbart, James L. Brooks (pre-Taxi), and Grant Tinker respectively.
I will speak here about the Mary Tyler Moore show.  A perfect oasis of great writing (Who uses words like ""rotten"" now?), and great acting, and a perfect ensemble, not to be matched until Brooks' ""Taxi"", and ""The Simpsons"" after that.  James L. Brooks has always excelled in comedy based on real character, and how said characters interact.  Who can forget the unbreakable group hug in Mary's final show?  At this writing, only the first four seasons of MTM are available on DVD.  The clarity of the video makes the show look more handsome than ever.  The acting, particularly that of Edward Asner and Ted Knight, is top-notch.  In the third and fourth season, we meet new characters like Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White), and Georgette Franklin (Georgia Engel)  Seeing these two in their prime defies describing how sweet that is.  The only reason I didn't give five stars to seasons 3 and 4, was the lack of special features; commentaries, interviews and the like.  We need the input of directors like Jay Sandrich, and writers like David Lloyd, who wrote the sixth season classic, ""Chuckles Bites The Dust"".  Until the sixth season is released, the best available episode is season 3's ""It's Not Whether You Win or Lose"", where the WJM crew are snowed in, and a poker game happens where Murray loses much money (we learn that Murray is a compulsive gambler in this episode), and to get it back, he wagers Ted double or nothing that he will not pronoune the name, Ideko Kawasaki properly.  This is what good, laugh out loud, character comedy is all about.  Oh, and don't forget to check out season 4's ""Better late (that's a pun) Than Never"", where Mary and Rhoda are up late doing obituaries, and they got both funny and creative on one obituary that had to be used before it could be changed.  The Mary Tyler Moore Show is a program that every serious student of comedy needs to study, and eventually own.  ILFT having all 7 seasons.

What surprised me is that as an adult I have a whole different perception of Mary.  Yes, the program was extremely funny and the cast was outstanding, but I found that Mary was not the independent, confident heroine that I remembered.  Instead she's mostly insecure and unable to stand up for herself and DEATHLY afraid of commitment. That definitely took some of the fun out of watching these old favorites.",1232409600,2,585,4.715686274509804

Sad to say, but I hated to see that this show was one in which these issues began coming on the scene.  Disgusting to see a really good show be ruined with bringing this stuff into its seasons.  Have all seasons up to this point, but definitely will not purchase the next season.  I remembered this show when I was a teen, but had forgotten about the time-frame where taboo subjects were introduced.  Happy with this dvd that things hadn't gotten out of hand yet.  Mary Tyler Moore is an excellent actress as well as all those co-starring.  The characters of Ted Baxter and Lou Grant bring tremendous comedy to the show...without these two characters, I doubt the show would have been so successful.

2432252,5,B000BOH8YQ,"This is yet another funny season's worth of one of television's classic comedies, full of (again) 24 great outings worth of laughter. There are several standout outings, but the showcase in this #3 of ""Mary Tyler Moore"" is the penultimate episode, ""Put on a Happy Face,"" 2/24/73.  Mary is nominated for a Teddy Award (television editors award), but prior to the ceremonies, everything starts going south for her. She gets a flat tire, slips on a waxed floor, unknowingly throws out the obituaries, drips coffee on her outfit at work, starts sneezing and sniffling, and, by the time of the presentation, is a general wreck. Fortunately, she does win an award at the ceremony (for a Sunday public-affairs show, I think), so all is not lost. All that happens to her in the interim, however, illustrates why this outing is one of the showcases of ""MTM."" ""Farmer Ted and the News"" is another standout, this one centering around Ted-- or more to the point, Lou signing a contract for Ted to appear in ads for other Twin Cities stations. When it affects Ted's performance as WJM anchorman, Lou regrets having signed that contract, and subsequently puts a stop to the commercials.

The episodes in this release are very good and funny (including the showcase ""Put on a Happy Face""), but there is something different about #3 as compared to #1 and #2-- there are no bonuses on this release. #1 had a good selection of bonuses, including Fall 1970 CBS premiere promos, a trivia challenge, Emmy clips, and more. #2 had more extras, including a look inside the making of the #4 title sequence in 1973 (as part of a local newsmagazine called ""Moore on Sunday"" for WCCO-TV channel 4, the CBS station in the Twin Cities), another trivia challenge, more Emmy clips, commentaries on certain outings, a Mad Magazine spoof, and more (though why the documentary inside the making of the #4 title sequence is not on the #4 release instead of the #2 release is anybody's guess). #3, however, is completely barebones-- just the episodes and that's it. Zero, zip, zilch where bonuses are concerned. It's packaged pretty well though--each of the 3 discs gets its own case, and the covers of these cases all follow the front box art.

In short, despite the barebones nature of #3, this is still worth getting for the fact that it has one of the showcase outings of ""MTM""-- that being ""Put on a Happy Face."" This should be the drawing power that draws you to a purchase of this release.",1225324800,,2459,4.713953488372093

Mary is a single woman trying to make it as an associate producer while her friends, family and coworkers swirl around her in various ways.  She is usually the most normal one in the bunch and a charming person at that.  While some reviewers comment that this season isn't as good as the first, second or fourth seasons, I found it every bit as charming and hilarious.  There isn't a big standout episode as much as a series of excellent episodes.  The effect is charming and consistent.  There isn't a bad episode in the bunch.

It says more about the quality of Fox marketing staff than about Mary Tyler Moore that the first four seasons apparently were not big sellers. They did not effectively promote them (from the poorly designed covers to the almost total lack of extras). The MTM show is considered one of the top TV comedies of all time and has the number one ranked episode of all time in a TV Guide poll (""Chuckles Bites the Dust"") in Season 6.

The MTM show is so enmeshed in culture that the theme song is in use in two commercials right now and the cast got a standing ovation at last year's Emmy Awards. But the Fox marketing ""experts"" dump the nearly bare bones first four seasons onto DVD with no promotion and then apparently kill the last three seasons because of ""poor sales.""

The quality of the actual video is very decent at least. The first four seasons are well worth buying here on Amazon. But people have been expecting some participation from Ms. Moore and other cast members, I think. There are also obviously people out there who will also wait and buy the whole set when it's released collectively.

Consider writing the editors of DVD review sites (there are many) and urge a petition to get Fox to relent and release the last three seasons or at least give up the rights to Nickelodeon or someone who knows how to do DVD correctly. Show some respect, Fox!",1176508800,,1520,4.556776556776557

2432277,5,B000BOH8YQ,"Although the show ran throughout the '70s, its appeal is still lasting today, in the story of Mary Richards and her eclectic co-workers in the WJM newsroom...

In the pilot, 30-year-old Mary has just moved to Minneapolis, eager to start a new life as a single careerwoman after her breakup with her fiance. She answers an ad seeking a secretary, and finds herself associate producer of the six o'clock news at WJM. There, she works for Lou Grant, a tough guy with a soft exterior and a ready bottle of booze, and alongside kindhearted news writer Murray and self-centered, idiotic reporter Ted Baxter.

On the home front, Mary decides to rent an apartment in the home of her college friend Phyllis Lindstrom...incurring the wrath of New York native Rhoda Morgenstern, who had her heart set on moving in. Despite their rocky start, the two opposite personalities quickly become best friends, creating the basis for much of the show's humor.

Some of Season 3's episodes center upon visits from Rhoda's stereotypically Jewish mother Ida; Mary's dating adventures; Murray's feelings of mediocrity; and various newsroom mishaps. It's also the first season where Georgia Engel appears as Ted's girlfriend Georgette.

If you've never seen this show, I urge you to give it a try! You'll soon be looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164844800,,1324,4.97737556561086
2432278,5,B000BOH8YQ,"In the golden years of Television - indeed in the golden years of Entertainment - quality was important. Performers on TV had honed their skills, during years of endeavour in halls and theatres across the country, perfecting their work. Musicians - of all forms of music - played proper instruments with virtuoso ability. Lyrics could be understood and the musical sound replicated - because it was written down and 'scored'. Actors, musicians, dancers, etc., all had 'great ability'.

Even in this milieu, some performers stood out as exceptional. When thoroughly competent TV directors and skilled television technicians were able to work with these outstanding performers, shows of exceptional quality and were produced.

Mary Tyler Moore had an ability and an aura about her that was rare. The 'situation comedy', a long cherished and much loved TV art-form, seemed to have been made for her and her many skills. Moore's first great TV success was in the Dick Van Dyke Show. Then, when she starred in her own shows, Moore was magnificent.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show was produced and directd by consumate experts. Add to this a particularly high standing of casting, which ensured only the best supporting actors,and the Mary Tyler Moore Show was destined to be in the 'Top Flight' of its gendre.

Importantly however, unlike the crass and peurile content of so much 'entertainment' today, the Mary Tyler Moore Show ( and other great shows of the era) contained no gratuitous violence, no explicit sex or nudity, and no foul or blasphemous language. The show was humourous without being coarse and was, truly, a delight to watch.",1162684800,2,1632,5.033333333333333

2432291,4,B000BOH8YQ,"Perhaps the four-star rating is stingy, but ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" raised the bar on television itself, so we've come to expect nothing less than excellence from one of the very best shows ever and certainly from one of the best comedy ensembles ever put together.  ""All in the Family,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" and ""MTM"" are among the best shows ever on television.  Later seasons, and, perhaps earlier ones should certainly garner the show five-star ratings.

Many of the episodes are indispensible.  ""Lou's Place,"" features Lou and Ted, who buy a local pub after the owner dies is vintage MTM.  Similarly, for two episodes featuring Ted:  One when he is loathe to compete with Gordy as co-anchor, and another when Ted hires an elderly woman agent who enables him to moonlight making money on obnoxious and unflattering commercials.  When Rhoda enters a beauty contest in ""Rhoda, the Beautiful,"" and when she takes her own business in ""...The Plant Lady,"" we are given more than our money's worth. (The price of this collection at twenty-four episodes is a bargain, especially if one compares it to other DVD collectibles.)  Perhaps the best one is when everything falls apart for Mary just before she goes to an awards' ceremony.  Most of the other episodes are merely excellent.  Despite some of the references, it is seldom dated, too.

The collection is sometimes marred, however, by mere dramatization.  Subjectively, the shows that have more drama than laughs don't quite hit the high bar that they have established for themselves.  The big three CBS seventies comedies were classic at going from big laughs to tears, but without laughs, some episodes suffer in quality overall.  Particularly the shows with Mary Richard's parents don't work as well.

Despite the picky qualms with a few episodes, this DVD set is a great entertainment value.  (The fourth season comes out in June, and it looks great!)",1146873600,5,1901,4.987301587301587
2432292,5,B000BOH8YQ,"By the third season, the cast and crew of The Mary Tyler Moore Show knew what they were doing and how to do it.  It shows in this wonderful three disc collection.

Little has changed in Mary Richard's (Mary Tyler Moore) world.  She works in the news room of WJM-TV in Minneapolis along with her boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner), anchor Ted Baxter (Ted Knight), and news writer Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod).  At home, she's got best friends Rhoda (Valerie Harper) and Phyllis (Cloris Leachman).  Whether it's the trials of serial dating (Mary and Rhoda's guys never last more then an episode) or trying to bring up the ratings at work, these characters are sure to face life with a joke to keep us laughing.

The big change to the show is the introduction of Georgia Engel as Ted's girlfriend Georgette.  I had forgotten, but she was originally Rhoda's co-worker introduced in ""Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York.""  She only gets four episodes here, but it's a start.

Unfortunately, Phyllis only has four episodes as well this season.  I always enjoy her appearances since she's so over the top funny.  I'm sure we all know someone who is convinced they know best no matter what the situation.

This season also features several appearances of Mary's parents after they move to Minneapolis.  Watching a loving relationship work through the issues this creates is nice.

Highlights of this season include:

""The Good Time News,"" which finds Mary trying to create a fun news show.

""It's Whether You Win or Lose"" finds gambling addict Murray in trouble when Mary sets up a poker night for the guys in the office.  Even a serious topic like this gets lots of laughs.

In ""Farmer Ted and the News,"" Ted begins doing commercials to make extra money, causing quite a problem when they air during the news.

Lou sees a more human side of Ted in ""Operation: Lou.""

Rhoda considers moving back to New York in ""Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York.""  Fortunately, she doesn't leave until the end of next season.

Phyllis feels like ""My Brother's Keeper"" when her brother starts hanging out with Rhoda instead of Mary like Phyllis had originally planned.  This episode features the first of Mary's truly horrid parties.

When ""Romeo and Mary"" go out and he won't take no for an answer about a second date, Mary really lets him have it.  Yet she winds up being the one that's embarrassed.

All told, there are twenty-four more episodes to make you laugh along with Mary and her friends.  There are no extras in the set this time around.  While I always love behind the scenes stuff, for the price, I won't complain about just getting the shows themselves.  The episodes look sharp with hardly any flaws in the picture and the sound, while mono, fits the show and sounds great.

I love this show.  Just thinking about the characters brings a smile to my face.  If you enjoy classic comedy, this set is for you.",1143763200,15,2908,4.697029702970297

So many memorable moments such as Lou trying his hand at bartending, in a very questionable partnership with Ted; to Murray being suckered into an ill-advised poker game; to Mary trying to reconcile her parents moving to town. This was truly a great show because it never lost its momentum over the years and it was a shame to see it finally sign off in 1977.

It's irritating how Fox has produced the set, with few commentaries - no MTM, for example- and each episode reverts back to the main menu, just like the Bob Newhart season DVDs, which is irritating.

The writing is - as always- clever and sensational , and fans grew to love Mary more with each season. It's very disturbing to see the diva now - after all the plastic surgery- looking nothing like the Mary we knew and loved; At least Valerie Harper aged gracefully and naturally, as did the rest of the cast, all but Ted Knight still with us.",1141344000,,657,4.567796610169491

Plucky Mary Richards(Mary Tyler Moore)holds her own at WJMTV,the TV news station with the lowest ratings but warmest people.

Mary's best friend Rhoda(Valeire Harper)a year before she got her own spin-off smash,""Rhoda""has continual disastrous dates in this season but always has a quick wit to makes us smile,Lou Grant(Ed Asner) tough talking but caring,ends up in hopital in one episode and has a vist from the newsroom fool,Ted Baxter,the hilarious Ted Knight.

Among all the laughs serious issues are handled like retirement,divorce,midlife crisis,poor Murray(Gavin MacLeod) feels life is passing him by,but its all done with great writing and performances,Chlors Leachman as the over bearing Phyllis only appears in about 4 episodes this season but is always a scene stealer!

My favourite episode is ""Put On A Happy Face"" where Mary after a series of disasters,attends an award ceremony looking awful and in a borrowed dress which Lou says makes her look like ""One of the Andrews Sisters""

I love this show as its so real and considering its nearly 30 years since it finished,it certainly is as fresh as ever!

Why have only the first three seasons been released? Why have they released up to Season Five of the Dukes Of Hazzard but not this?

I feel that I have to dock 1 star from MTM Season 3 because of the ""downer"" episodes that just aren't as much fun as most of the others:  like Murray feeling life has passed him by, or
the one with Joseph Campanella.  Plus that fact that for the first time in the series, Mary makes an ass of herself a couple of times.  For instance, when she goes to Lou's office to ask for an additional $50 per week, she gets all choked up and turns away and just stands there like a fool.  And then she complains that Lou doesn't seem concerned.  In the business world you have to speak up and say what's on your mind.  That was embarrassing to watch.  Also, in season 3 Mary goes out with too many losers who don't treat her right.  She comes across as a bit pathetic when she starts getting all upset about the anchovies on the pizza brought by David Campanella.  I especially hate it the way Mary fawns all over Murray when he's in a bad mood and being unresponsive to her (she does that in another episode (from a different season) as well--the one where she's pestering him and then starts saying ""Murray...Murray Murray Murray Murray..."").",1139616000,,1458,4.3003663003663
2432335,5,B000BOH8YQ,"The third season of MTM got the audience ready for the changes of the forth season, including the Rhoda spinoff and addressed some social issues.  The 24episodes are presented on three discs.

This is the last season that the original cast is together.  Mary Tyler Moore is perfection as Mary Richards.  She is knows when to go for it or hold back.  She was definitely underappreciated for this series.  This is Valerie Harper's last season as Rhoda.  This season Rhoda makes a transformation and Valerie handles it perfectly.  Ed Asner is absolute perfection as Lou.  You can see why Emmy loved him.  Gavin McLeod takes a minor character and made it a central character.  Ted Knight has his best season and gets a real girlfriend.

This is the one of the best written and directed seasons.

Disc One:

The Good Time News - This episode tackles two issues.  The first is Mary finds out the previous associate producer made $50 more a week (a lot at that time). The only reason that Lou gives is she is a woman.  The second is the changing face of local news.  Rather than being straight news, the local news was trying to be more accessible to the public.  But many went too far to make it pure comedy instead of news.  WJM decides to change their format.  Mary has the idea to make Gordy the co-anchor.  With Gordy as the personality and Ted as the straight man, it could work.  It does until Ted finds out.  This is an all out laugh fest.

What is Mary Richards Really Like? - Mary is being interviewed by a hyper critical newspaper columnist, Mark Williams (Peter Haskell).  But it's more than just an interview, Mark is also interested in Mary personally.  But when the article comes out it makes Mary look wonderful and the rest terrible. (Note: Rhoda refers to her married sister)

Who's in Charge Here? - Lou gets promoted and Mary doesn't want Lou's job until it's too late.

Enter Rhoda's Parents - Ida (Nancy Walker) and Martin (Harold Gould) Morgenstern are visiting Rhoda but Ida has shocking news, Pop is having an affair.  (Nancy Walker shows her golden magic and Harold Gould shows why he got the part for Rhoda)

It's Whether You Win or Lose - This episode tackles compulsive gambling.  Lou's trip to sunny Las Vegas is snowed out.  Lou tells Mary to organize a poker game.  Murray doesn't want to play until sucker Ted shows up.  Marie (Joyce Bullifant) shows up at Mary's and tells her that Murray is a compulsive gambler.  Mary goes to the game to get Murray without letting any know she knows Murray's secret.  This is hilarious.  But how Murray gets his losses back is even better.

Rhoda the Beautiful - Rhoda loses 20 pounds!  Then to make things worse, at work she is nominated for Ms. Hemples!  The good news is Phyliss can no longer make her fat jokes.  This is the show that signaled Rhoda's impending departure.

Just Around the Corner - We finally get to meet Mary's parents (Nanette Fabray and Bill Quinn) and they are moving to Minneapolis.  And they find the almost perfect apartment

But Seriously, Folks - Mary is dating a writer (Jerry Van Dyke) for The Chuckles the Clown show.  He quits the show and decides to become a stand up comic.

Disc Two:

Farmer Ted and the News - Ted gets an agent to negotiate his new contract.  She only asks for one thing, remove the exclusivity clause.  Lou agrees to his regret, as Ted appears in a series of really tacky commercials.

Have I Found a Guy for You - Jack and Linda Foster (Bert Convey and Beth Howland) have the perfect marriage.  That is until Jack shows up for dinner without Linda.

You've Got a Friend - Mary's mom is handling the move, she has Mary, Phyllis and Rhoda but Mary's dad hasn't made any new friends.  So Mary decides that Lou would be a good choice for a friend.  When that doesn't workout, Mary decides that maybe she needs to be his friend.  This leads to a beautiful scene where she and her father finally bond.

It was Fascination, I Know - Bess' ""boyfriend"" falls for Aunt Mary.

Operation: Lou - Lou goes into have some shrapnel removed and leaves Mary in charge.  This causes a riff between Mary and Murray but Lou and Ted bond.

Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York - So long Rhoda!  Rhoda accepts a job at Bloomingdales.  This episode introduces Georgette as a workmate of Rhoda. (Oh, by the way, Rhoda doesn't leave.)

The Courtship of Mary's Father's Daughter - Mary runs into Dan, the night school teacher from season 2.  He's getting married.  When Mary and Rhoda show up for the engagement party, it causes a fight.  She and Dan start to date but she is not ready for a commitment.

Lou's Place - McClusky's bar is for sale and Lou decides to buy it.

Disc Three:

My Brother's Keeper - Phyllis' brother (Robert Moore) has come for a visit and she can't wait to set him up with Mary.  The only problem is that Ben likes Rhoda.  This is also the first in what will become an annual disaster - Mary throws a party.  This also is the second appearance of Georgette.

The Georgette Story - Ted is taking advantage of Georgette's good nature. Mary decides to take thing into her own hands and sets up Georgette with someone else.  It is revealed that Rhoda dated Ted.  (Mary says that she introduced Ted and Georgette but they met a Rhoda's going away party and she worked with Rhoda.)

Romeo and Mary - Rhoda and Mary double date but Mary's blind date (Stuart Margolin) will not leave her alone. (Great line Lou: Did I see Mary being taken out in handcuffs? Murray: Yes. Lou: They must be rounding up Protestants.)

What Do You Say When the Boss Says, ""I Love You"" - Lou's new boss is a woman (Lois Nettleton).  But things get complicated when Barbara tells Mary that she has a crush on Lou.

Murray Faces Life - When a local journalist, Murray went to school with, wins the Pulitzer Prize, Murray gets depressed.

Remembrance of Things Past - An old flame (Joseph Campenella) arrives in town.  The problem is he is still neglectful of Mary.

Put on a Happy Face - This is the episode that you wait for every year, The Teddy Awards.  Mary is having a bad day.  Her alarm did not go off, she got a flat tire, her boyfriend cancelled their date for the Teddy Awards and she accidentally tossed the obituary file.  The next day is not much better, her hair is a mess, she sprains her ankle, soaking it has given her a cold and she cannot find a date for the Teddy's.  The night of the Teddy's get worse, her dress is ruined, her hair dryer is broken, it's raining, her date is Ted Baxter but things look up when she wins!

Mary Richards and the Incredible Plant Lady - Rhoda opens a plant shop with money borrowed from Mary.  When Rhoda shows up with a lot of shopping boxes, Mary wonders if she will get her money back. (Craig T Nelson makes an appearance as a car mechanic who has a crush on Mary)

One of my all-time favorite episodes is in the third season (""Put On A Happy Face""), featuring one of MTM's best performances.  Ms. Moore is at the forefront of this story, and she is superb in spoofing her 'perfect' image - an Emmy-worthy effort.

2432358,4,B000BOH8YQ,"In one episode in this Season Three compilation, Mary tells Ted Baxter that he has absolutely no personality and needs a co-anchor for his revamped news program. Pretty ironic statement from Mary, since ONLY Ted Baxter has personality at WJM, at least the only funny one. MTM could be a pretty amusing show, but it was never laugh-out-loud funny like ""The Honeymooners"" or ""All In The Family"" except for the exceptional talents of Ted Knight. He delivered his lines like a true pro and was the only bona-fide comedian. Knight, who based his character on pompous L.A. newscasters George Putnam and Jerry Dunphy, outshined the rest of the cast--something I only really noticed after the passing of time and revisiting the show with this DVD. What's more, Ted Baxter emerges as a highly sympathetic and likeable character, politically incorrect before his time, with a pretty big heart under all that superficial bluster and self-promotion. And you know what, save his occasional bumbling, he's a good news reader as well. (Compare him to the dolts on YOUR local newscasts these days.) Meanwhile the rest of the characters on this show seem a lot more annoying and unappealing than I remembered them, especially with their ugly, mean-spirited attacks on newscaster Baxter. There's Mary, with that high-pitched voice, who sits at her desk but never seems to work or come up with any good ideas and always seems to be fussing over some nitpicking personal problem; no wonder the WJM News stinks so bad with such an associate producer on board. By the third season Mary was sliding into middle-age, losing the still-girlish appeal she had in the First Season, which makes her trivial obsessions all the more harder to take. There's Rhoda, with her whiny New York Jewishness, never happy about anything. A little bit of her goes a long way. Phyllis, the shrill busybody with every liberal fad in her head. Maury, smug, with his awful ""jokes."" Lou, with his phony tough-guy routine. No, it was only Ted Baxter who was really likeable and funny on this show--until Sue Ann Nivens came along a season later. Nevertheless, compared to the trash that passes as situation comedies these days (nothing but lame sex jokes), MTM is a winner and worth your time. (Mary does sport a great '70s wardrobe and Rhoda's apartment is out-of-sight kooky.)

The first thing I noticed upon getting this set, is that it's a pretty barebones release. There are no extras whatsoever, unlike the previous two sets which had quite a few. I was hoping that there would be at least some more of the Emmy clips, as there were in the two other sets. I really enjoyed those. It would also have been nice to hear some commentaries for a couple of the best episodes of the series, ""It's Whether You Win or Lose"" and ""Put On a Happy Face"". A commentary by Valerie Harper for ""Rhoda the Beautiful"" would have made it especially nice.

As it is, what we have is just the shows themselves, which, thankfully look and sound as nicely as they did in the previous sets. I did notice a couple of minor picture jitters, such as in the tag of ""Mary Richards and the Incredible Plant Lady"", but nothing too bad. What I DID notice that was rather disappointing, was that a scene in the aforementioned episode had been edited. At the 17 minute mark, Ted walks into the newsroom singing to himself. In the original version (as well as the versions I have seen in syndication), he was singing ""Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)"", from ""Annie Get Your Gun"". It was a brief, but funny moment, and memorable Ted Baxter. Instead, on this DVD, the sound has been dubbed over so that he is simply mumbling nonsense (""do do do""). I'm assuming this has something to do with rights. Maybe Fox could not get them, or did not want to pay for them, but still, the result is a version that has been tampered with, from the original.

Eagle-eye fans who got the First Season set, will probably remember that the episode, ""Christmas and the Hard Luck Kid"" had a few seconds when Mary sings ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" cut. At the time I thought that was an innocent mistake (bad print used), but now I fear it may have been an intentional cut. Nowhere on the packaging does it say that any of these shows have been altered, but then, it also does not say that they HAVE been altered. The least that Fox could do is make mention of this, and after the fiasco of their ""In Living Color"" season sets, where all the memorable music paradies were cut out...I am concerned that more music bits of MTM are going to be left off. Let's hope not. I would hate to not see classic moments like Georgette's ""Steam Heat"" number in the 7th Season, not on DVD.

All in all, a nice set. However, I still wish someone other then Fox had chosen to release these. I'm still bummed that it took them two and a half years to put out the Second Season. We could have had them all by now.",1137888000,7,2854,4.289424860853432

Season III is when the cast really began to come into their own.  From here through season 7 the shows just get funnier and funnier.  I have watched every episode from each season at least a half a dozen times in my life and they still crack me up.  What a treat to be able to see them again restored, uncut and unedited.

2432362,5,B000BOH8YQ,"When I saw this season was being released without any bonus features, I worried that Fox had skimped on the quality of the re-mastering just so they could release it in a hurry.

No worries!  Each episode has the same vibrant colors and excellent sound as the Season 1 and 2 releases.  Episodes are uncut and look beautiful.

This season is special to me because it has my all-time favorite episode (sorry, ""Chuckles"" is #2) -- ""Put on a Happy Face"" -- worth watching anytime you're having a bad day.

Here's to seasons 4 through 7, as soon as Fox can get them out.",1137628800,,565,4.394230769230769
2432363,5,B000BOH8YQ,"Season three of the Mary Tyler Moore Show provides yet more essential classic tv viewing.

The 24-episode 1972-1973 Season opens with ""The Good-Time News"". To boost WJM-TV's sagging ratings, Mary has to make the six o'clock news more upbeat. Her plans seem to work---until Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) is involved. Mary also self-advocates for equitable associate producer pay.

Mary works in the news business herself, but she is not yet the hard-nosed journalist. In ""What Is Mary Richards Really Like"" she is interviewed by newspaper columnist Mark Williams (Peter Haskell) and ends up telling more than she should-Mary did not second-guess the perils of disclosure for public figures such as herself, that interview ultimately comes back to haunt her. Meanwhile, Lou Grant (Ed Asner) gets a coveted promotion to program director and the corresponding task of deciding who is going to fill his now previous job-which he wants the right person in.

However she is not adverse to networking with the boys as demonstrated in ""It's Whether You Win or Loose"". She organizes an office poster game after Lou's trip to Las Vegas is canceled. Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod) then looses a substantial amount of his money to Ted Baxter.

Other great episodes include ""Put On A Happy Face"" simply because best friends have conflicting good/bad days ironically when Mary is supposed to go to the Teddies-the `tv world' version of the Emmys-for her production work. Then ""My Brother's Keeper and ""Just Around The Corner"" explore how close families can get without good intentions backfiring and driving each other crazy. This one season alone has five episodes considered by fans to be the best among this entire series

""You've Got A Friend"" is a personal  favorite of mine---the possibility that parents and adult children can become friends-if done right-- is a good theme. Finally, Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York is important because this is the episode which launches Valerie Harper into her own successful show. The following year, `Rhoda' would debut and quickly establish itself as an equally successful but unique show.

Mary Tyler Moore continues working with today audiences because it handles relevant social issues but does not nag viewers. Instead, we are supposed to be entertained. People even attempting to write `very special' episodes for today's series need to go back and study this sitcom to see how pros really do things.

Again, the studios have their act together with the DVD production of this series--they are releasing them! Realizing that even the most dedicated fans have purchase limits, this season is reasonably priced. I use the term `reasonably' because there is a $20.99 price tag. I suspect the price is because there are NO bonus features included in this release.",1137628800,2,2801,5.154185022026431
2432364,5,B000BOH8YQ,"What 'moore' can be said about the MTM Show that hasn't already been said?  I'm very happy to add Season Three to my Classic TV DVD collection.  While there isn't a special feature diskette included in this nicely packaged box set, it's the actual 30 minute episodes we really want to see and they are as sharp, clear and colorful as they were when we first saw them back in 1972.  One new feature that I especially enjoy that wasn't available in the Seasons 1 and 2 sets is the 'Play All Episodes' feature which allows hours of uninterrupted viewing pleasure.  Thank you Fox!  I am so looking forward to the quick release of Seasons Four through Seven of this all-time television classic!

This is a show that just keeps getting better and better as the seasons go by!",1137542400,,769,4.496402877697841
2432365,5,B000BOH8YQ,"This morning I ran out and bought this box set. Although I've only watched four episodes so far, it appears that Fox did an excellent job in producing this set. The colors are bright, the picture is crisp and excellent along with clear sound.

With season three, all 24 episodes are on three disks instead of the 4 disks season one and two contained, and there are no extra features. No problem here with the lack of special features since I usually only watch them once and forget they exist.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show was the best situation conedy of the 1970's with an excellent cast & brilliant writing.

Pristine, full episodes are what I look for in a season box set, and it appears that Fox did a great job. Please release MTM seasons 4 through 7 soon!

2432366,5,B000BOH8YQ,"Its great to see that Season 3 has made it to DVD.  This is the year

that MTM truly established its own identity and moved beyond the more

conventional first two seasons.  Mary is now a consciously liberated

woman no longer worried about being over thirty and single. While

avoiding overt political messages the writers embraced this change and

helped create what is in some ways the strongest season.

Though most of the ""classic"" episodes occur later in the series, season

3 is perhaps the most consistently excellent week to week.

There are many episodes that should not be overlooked, from the season opener,

""The Good Time News"", where Mary and Ted spar during an on-air editorial,

to ""Lou's Place"", which explores Lou's ill-fated attempt to own a favorite local bar.

""The Courtship of Mary's Father's Daughter"" reunites Mary with an old flame, only

now she's an unintentionally disruptive guest at his engagement party (watch

for their initial meeting in the elevator to see a great example of Mary Tyler Moore's

gift for understated physical comedy).

In Season 3 the characters begin to function as a family and, without delving into

hot-button ""issues"" like All in the Family or Maude, demonstrate a realism

of another kind in personal relationships.  See Mary criticize Rhoda for

maintaining her poor self image even as she runs in and wins a department store beauty contest in ""Rhoda the Beautiful"", an episode both touching and very funny.

Mary's attempts to buck up a despondent coworker in ""Murray Faces Life""  likewise

highlight the unique genius of the MTM series in deftly combining humor with

genuine emotional moments that never turn sappy or maudlin.

Its wonderful that Fox is continuing to release seasons of MTM after the initial

dispiriting sales of Season 1.  I never expected we would get past the second

year (the work of which was apparently mostly completed about the time the

first season DVDs went on sale and yet still was not issued for nearly 3 years).

Even if there are no more ""extras"" or special features the important thing is that

all the complete unedited shows make it to video.  Especially at a time when

so many other shows of much lesser quality get released in their entirety its

a must for MTM fans to purchase these first three seasons to help Mary survive

in the marketplace.  It would be a shame if the following seasons, especially

4, 5 and 6, and to a lesser extent 7, were never issued.  I think Season 3

represents a great second chance for us.",1136332800,19,2526,4.7972027972027975
