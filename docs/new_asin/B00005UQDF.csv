7955395,5,B00005UQDF,The kids are adorable and the educational aspect for body parts are great.  There is also an exercise component that my grandchildren love. We have watched it for years.  Now the 2 year old is getting into it.,1372032000,,209,4.473684210526316
7955396,4,B00005UQDF,"I was able to find this product at another online store on sale for half price, so I bought the whole library.  I didn't see many reviews for it, so I thought as I watch these with my son, I'd write about it to help other parents decide.

My son is 10 months and finds this dvd entertaining.  I'm not sure a preschooler would be enthralled, but a baby, oh yes!

The video reviews all body parts from head to toe - hair, head, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, neck, shoulders, back, chest, arms, elbow, hands, fingers, wrists, hips, bottom, legs, knees, shins, ankle, feet, toes.  The words are displayed in all caps (I believe) when introducing the concept.

For each word they show it on all kinds of children of different races by talking about something you wear on that body part or something a child does with that body part.  A child's voice or an adult voice introduces each scene: The girl is wearing a bracelet on her wrist.

The music is lively, the scenes change pretty quickly.  There is no animation, just real kids in different settings doing different things while a voice over tells about it.

For comparison, this series reminds me a little bit of the Your Baby Can Read series.  I hope this helps.  I would recommend it if your child likes Your Baby Can Read or if they like looking at real children and babies vs. cartoons.",1337126400,,1334,4.444444444444445
7955397,4,B00005UQDF,"This program covers the most basic parts and goes beyond to cover finger nails, wrists, etc.  Each part is illustrated multiple times with different children and also used in sentences. (i.e. for arms, ""He's using his arm to lift the weight."")  There is also a question section at the end (""What part of the body do you wear socks on?"").  Some of the clothes are a bit 90's but young children won't care.  This program does an excellent job of going over everything and is far less annoying than most children dvds. (My one dislike is the mime they have for a few seconds at the very beginning.  I usually fast forward through that part.)

My 3 yr old loves this dvd and has expanded on his vocabulary of body parts from watching it.  This is an excellent vocabulary building tool!",1268179200,,781,4.49645390070922
7955398,1,B00005UQDF,"This video covers a lot of different body parts.  It has the usual body parts that you'd think would be in a kids video, but they also include other parts like shoulders, elbows, hips, bottom, fingernails, toenails, shins.  There is a mime in the beginning that does pantomime and has a really weird face.  At first you just see his face (covered in white makeup) and his hands and feet.  He must be in front of some green screen because you can't see all of his body.  Then he unzips himself so that the rest of his body is shown.  I really thought this was creepy (his mouth is open and it's a really big mouth....not very attractive at all).  Later they show the same mimes hands and they are juggling.  This would have been an ok video if the mime was left out.  Because of this mime I won't keep my copy........I honestly think this guy could scare a young child (it kind of scares me, LOL!).  Read my other reviews.",1116374400,,921,4.3023255813953485
