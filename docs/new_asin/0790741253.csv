I enjoyed seeing Helen Hayes playing Jane Marples guessing who the murder is at a resort. A Caribbean Mystery has superb actors such as: Jameson Parker, Season Hubley, Benard Hughes, Swoosie Kurtz, Brock Peters, Lynne Moody, Maurice Evans and Cassie Yates. They have given outstanding performances.  I enjoyed one scene where the murderer thought the woman in the lake was his wife instead it was one of the guest who resembled the same color hair as his wife.",1155859200,2,601,4.9405940594059405

I watched this movie without reading the 1964 Dame Agatha novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mysteries altogether.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

The movie begins with Miss Marple (Helen Hayes) arriving at an island hotel for rest and relaxation.  At the hotel she meets a retired major who tells her of his past adventures.  One of the last things he says to Miss Marple is:

""Like to see a picture of a murderer?""

As the major is looking at the picture and is about to hand it to the super sleuth, he unexpectedly sees the murderer at the island hotel.  Miss Marple never sees the picture or sees who he was looking at and the next day the major turns up dead.  This death is suspected of being a murder and Captain Daventry (Zakes Mokae) officially investigates and Miss Marple unofficially investigates.

Eventually, two more deaths and an attempted suicide occur.

Who are the people staying or working at this island hotel?  They are as follows:

1) Retired Major Palgrave (Maurice Evans)
2) Retired Tycoon Jason Rafiel (Barnard Hughes)
3) Hotel owner Tim Kendall (Jameson Parker)
4) Tim's wife, Molly (Season Hubley)
5) Nurse to the tycoon, Ruth Walker (Swoosie Kurtz)
6) Flirt Lucky Dyson (Cassie Yates)
7) Lucky's husband, Greg (Stephen Macht)
8) Housewife Evelyn Hillington (Beth Howland)
9) Evelyn's husband, Edward (George Innes)
10) Dr. Graham (Brock Peters)
11) Hotel Maid Victoria Johnston (Lynne Moody)
12) Aid to the tycoon, Arthur Jackson (Mike Preston)

Hayes does a good job in her role (though not as good as the ""other"" Miss Marple, Joan Hickson).  (Hayes was 83 years old in this movie!).  Also look for the fine performances of Swoosie Kurtz as the talkative nurse and Barnard Hughes as the grumpy tycoon.

The cinematography is well done.  As well there is some nice Reggae music.

Finally, hardcore British mystery fans will find this Americanized version different from what they expect.  However, the movie does present the murder mystery quite well.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

7791463,5,0790741253,"I am quite a fan of Agatha Christie, and when I saw this movie on Ebay i quickly snatched it up.  This was a great version of one of Dame Agatha's best books.  Miss Marple (Helen Hayes) is sent to the Caribbean by her nephew who was worried about her health after an illness.  Once there, Miss Marple becomes aquainted with an elderly general with a knack for story telling.  One particular story envolved a murderer and a snapshot; when he goes to show M. Marple, he recognizes one of the people on the island as the same person in the photo.  He is found dead soon after.  Belief was that he died of a heart attack, but when a nosy maid is killed a few days later, the islanders realize that a killer is among them, and only wily Miss Marple can solve the mystery.
I highly recommend this movie to any mystery lover.... Don't be put off by the fact that the movie was moved from the 50s to the 80s.... it truley is wonderful!",1084406400,2,927,4.209039548022599
