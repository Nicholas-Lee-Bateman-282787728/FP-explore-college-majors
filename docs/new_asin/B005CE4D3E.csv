8465168,3,B005CE4D3E,"Toradora! is about Ryuji (dragon) and Taiga (tiger) who help each other in every possible way to confess to their crushes. However, they form an interesting friendship that is sweet and strange at times. It'll make you laugh. Eventually these two start forgetting about their old crushes and start crushing on each other instead.

I watched the entire anime and it was alright. It has some funny moments here and there in every episode. But some things were too boring or slow-paced that I couldn't keep my attention on it. Part 1 to this show is very similar in feeling to part 2.",1389484800,,581,4.640776699029126
8465169,5,B005CE4D3E,"The entire story and how it was written was done really well.  It is a great anime for someone who is looking to see what anime is about and can be about.  Many people I talk with usually think that anime is about fighting with swords and demons and nudity, but this is not anywhere near that.  This is a simple, beautifully written anime great for almost any age older than 13.",1367798400,,378,4.222222222222222
8465170,5,B005CE4D3E,"Even after the climactic middle section (Christmas Eve party), Toradora! continued on with a great story line and an interesting character dynamics shift. The way Ryuji, Taiga, Minori, Takamasu, and Ami all change and grow makes the final half of the story even better than the first half, and makes me sad to see it all end, though the ending is awesome.",1359936000,,355,4.741935483870968
8465171,5,B005CE4D3E,"I'm far from the teenage Japanese girl for whom this series is intended, but I'll try to explain why this high school romance is outstanding in its class.

Ryuji is so domestic, he loves cooking and even cleaning, but his eyes are as tough as Clint Eastwood's, and he intimidates his classmates.  He lives next to cute little Taiga, who has such a fierce personality, she's known as the `palmtop tiger'.  But when each realizes that the other has a crush on their respective best friends, they form an odd alliance.  Ryuji is after Kushieda, sweet and perky, a girl always on the go, while Taiga adores Kitamura, a student council member who exudes having it all together.  The early episodes are average and the soundtrack, bubblegum pop.  However with the entrance of Kawashima, a beautiful teen model who is adorable to her fans but nasty to her rivals, the show finds its groove.  She sets her ambitions on Ryuji and completes this love pentangle.

The characters are surprisingly nuanced.  All of them mature during the series, and thread the line between love, pride, friendship, and envy while sometimes supporting each other in nonobvious ways.  After Kawashima has been ugly to Taiga, it's Taiga who unwittingly helps Kawashima deal with a stalker.  Kawashima realizes she owes a debt, and while the two continue spatting, an uneasy friendship develops.  Taiga is even meaner than Kawashima, particularly towards Ryuji, but he doesn't use anger to tame the tiger.  He builds trust.  The series is not about the characters transforming as much as finding acceptance as they are.

Not all circumstances are resolved without heartbreak, and the characters make some courageous decisions.  While all three women have something to offer Ryuji, ultimately he must open the door and reveal his choice.",1355443200,3,1803,5.0
