8284006,4,B001BP14WQ,"Douglas Sirk's A TIME TO LOVE AND A TIME TO DIE, based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, was perhaps one of his most personal films.  In the 1930s, Sirk had himself fled Nazi Germany, leaving a son in the process (who subsequently died on the front).  The film wasn't a big success, mainly, I suspect, because it flew in the face of what audiences were expecting from a ""Sirk picture""; namely, another florid melodrama like his sublime ""Magnificent Obsession"", ""Imitation of Life"", etc.

Set during the final chaotic months of WW2, A TIME TO LOVE AND A TIME TO DIE stars John Gavin as Ernst Graeber, a young German soldier who returns to his hometown.  There, he finds that his parents have disappeared, and the only one to whom he can turn is Elizabeth Kruse (Liselotte Pulver), a brief acquaintance from childhood, whose father was interned in the camps as a political prisoner.  Together, Ernst and Elizabeth share what little happiness they can summon in a literally crumbling world.

This film depicts the emotional toll that the war took on Germany.  Certainly towards the end, many Germans had finally seen through Hitler's elaborate smokescreen and admitted the sheer madness of it all.  On the surface, A TIME TO LOVE... sounds bleak and depressing, but it's actually a film of great beauty and passion.  Known for his lush use of colour in movies like ""Written on the Wind"" and ""All That Heaven Allows"", Sirk instead paints this story in shades of grey and brown.  The film opens with the shot of a flower, forced to bloom prematurely from the heat of gunfire and bombs.  It provides the metaphor for the main idea of the story (the two young lovers who've grown up perhaps too quickly in an unforgiving, violent world).

John Gavin's performance is quite exceptional, but it's to Sirk's credit that he cast virtual unknown (to American audiences at least) Liselotte Pulver in the female lead.  As the characters of Ernst and Elizabeth ""dance atop the volcano"" of an imploding Germany, Sirk surrounds them with a gallery of outstanding supporting players including Keenan Wynn, Don DeFore, Jock Mahoney, and even Erich Maria Remarque himself in a small but pivotal role.

The DVD from Australia (part of Madman's deluxe ""Directors Suite"" series) comes equipped with the trailer plus an informative, if quite dry, audio commentary with Professor Ross Gibson from the University of Contemporary Arts in Sydney (this is the only audio commentary I've heard where the speaker is cut off before he can complete his final sentence - Gibson drones on and on throughout the end credits so we never actually hear him close the audio commentary!).  ""Out There in the Dark"" is an interview with screenwriter Wesley Strick (the remake of ""Cape Fear""), who shares his own opinions on why Douglas Sirk is so revered amongst film fans.",1292284800,,2834,4.862785862785863
