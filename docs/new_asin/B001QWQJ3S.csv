3771277,4,B001QWQJ3S,"So far I have only watched the first F&F on the Blu-ray copies, and the picture and sound are good.  My 1080p TV is down for the moment so I'm watching them in 720p on my computer screen with Logitech's 5.1 Z-5500 speaker set through Windows Media Player.

At first I was getting alot of distortion through the speakers but I adjusted the SRS settings and all is good now.  As far as the picture goes, from what little I can see it is looking pretty sharp.  Which leads me to my only complaint.  I did the Digital Transfers on the disk to the computer and when I play it through Windows Media Player, I only get an 8x3.5 inch box to view it on.  The picture in that 8x3.5 inches is pretty good but if I try to full screen it, it drops ALOT of the quality of the picture and gets grainy.  By the way, my monitor is a W2252QT 22' wide screen from LG.  So you know its not the monitor cause its a good screen from a good company.",1238284800,,926,4.021857923497268
3771278,5,B001QWQJ3S,"After buying several Blu-rays and being completely let down on picture quality (Gone in 60 Seconds!!!!), I was debating whether to even get this. I really only wanted the original F&F, but obviously they don't want single sales.

I got this from a B&M store (instant gratification...) and was mildly surprised with the picture and sound quality (although my audio setup is not yet so great).

I have the Sony BDP-S350 with the 2.0 firmware update (or so I thought) and the BD-Live does NOT work on any disc. I don't really care, but it would have been cool to see what the fuss is all about.

3771300,5,B001QWQJ3S,"Personally I love these movies and couldn't wait for them to come out on Blu Ray.
The First movie was what got me in to cars as corny as it sounds.  But each new release I couldn't wait to see.  Now that they are in Hi-Def I can blast them on the surround sound to listen to the cars.
The First movie in terms of plot and story hands down is the best one, but with new and original cars they will keep you watching until the gang is reunited in the 4th installment, sold seperate.
The movies look and sound amazing.  This is a pack you will not be dissapointed with.",1293667200,2,566,4.035714285714286

3771302,4,B001QWQJ3S,"Got this during the recent Gold Box deal of the week.  Despite the date expiring on the digital copies, they all worked fine for me on a Mac through iTunes.  So don't believe the dates, just try it and see if the copies actually work for you before posting.  Great trilogy of movies.",1289952000,,283,4.30188679245283
3771303,3,B001QWQJ3S,"Although I haven't watched all three movies that come with this, I thought I would provide my initial impression for those who are on the fence about whether to get this or not.  I already have all three movies on DVD, so I was reluctant to buy the trilogy on Blu-ray, since my experience with Blu-ray is that the difference between it and a DVD isn't worth the extra amount you pay to have a movie on Blu-ray.  Nevertheless, I'm a big fan of The Fast and the Furious movies and noticed that if you bought these three movies in the trilogy on DVD it would cost more, so it seemed like a good deal.

While the price is definitely a bargain, the quality of the movie is somewhat of a question.  Having both the DVD and now the Blu-ray versions of these movies, the actual picture quality difference is marginal at best.  In addition to a Blu-ray player, I own a high-definition tv, so whether I'm watching Blu-ray movies or DVDs I'm able to watch them as best as they can be.

Where I was a little disappointed was in the sound quality.  The background noise from either the music or other things - such as the engine noise from the cars - is overwelmingly louder than the people talking.  Several times I had to adjust the volume during scenes where there was mostly music or engine noise because it was loud enough to disturb my neighbors in my apartment.  After turning the volume down and moving on to another scene which required listing to people talk, I had to run the volume back up.

I have quite a collection of movies, and as mentioned earlier these same movies from the trilogy, and haven't had this experience before, so I can't blame the equipment.  It's not enough of an issue to cause me to want to return this (since it didn't cost that much to begin with), but I would recommend to anyone who already owns this trilogy on DVD to save your money for something else, as you won't notice any true ""upgrade"" in your viewing experience and the sound quality may become frustrating.  If you don't own these movies on DVD to begin with, you can save some money buying the trilogy but be aware that your listening enjoyment maybe challenged.",1289606400,,2149,4.426395939086294
3771304,5,B001QWQJ3S,"I bought this blu-ray set during Amazon's gold deal, which was a real good value. Great collection for those love to watch some street racing action with unreal / fantasy maneuvers (more real than Speed Racer the movie). Nothing beats man/machine interaction and the sounds. The Tokyo drift was cool. Surround sound spatial encoding was great as I can constantly hear from different speakers. This is a fast action film so make sure you have a fast refresh big screen! Nice extras as well.

Watching this type of movies does make me itch to get back into driving a stick shift, and sure to invest in some performance enhancing parts!",1289520000,6,633,4.754545454545455
3771305,1,B001QWQJ3S,"Now as much as I ""love"" these crappy movies, when I buy a set on blu-ray, or dvd for that matter I expect for the whole thing to be there. I have back to the future... all 3 movies are there. I have robocop... all 3 of them. F&F... 3 of the 4. So now I can buy this and have ""some"" of the collection, or wait until they sell through these and make a 4 pack. I'll wait ;)",1289347200,5,370,3.6375

3771307,3,B001QWQJ3S,"I brought this product on July 15th, 2010.  All movies included a digital copy...Yeah right.  The digital copy expired on 3/31/2010, after I purchased the item.  I contacted Universal Digital copy support for the digital copy and they sent me an email stating ""Unfortunately this feature has officiall ben discontinued.""

3771308,3,B001QWQJ3S,While I enjoy the movies thru my Blu-ray player part of the reason I got this set was to have digital copies to play on my ipad. All of the codes EXPIRED IN MARCH 2010. This info really needs to be put in the main product description,1285200000,29,233,3.978723404255319

3771311,5,B001QWQJ3S,"The fast and the Furious Trilogy is one of those series that people try to hide that they like, but the minute someone brings it up they want to be part of the conversation.  Altough the first one was great and the second was (I will let you judge) and the third was was cool because it was cool that they introduced the world to drifting, the series has stood the test of time.  The new one (aptly named Fast and Furious) brought the series back to wher it belong.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are awesome and the women are beautiful.",1271030400,3,534,4.215686274509804

Fact is these movies look AWESOME in HD. The quality is excellent here and they really do look way better on BluRay. I previously owned all moves separately on DVD - so I've seen them to compare. If you're looking at getting all of the movies at some point and have BluRay capability - this is the way to go.",1267401600,2,477,4.184782608695652
3771313,4,B001QWQJ3S,"I really enjoyed these and the 4th was pretty good considering the between times for Dom to be in the picture..Never reall like the ending of Tokoyo Drift where Black makes the statement""This ain't no 10 second race""!

That was crap for the show and made it look worse than what it was!!Be hard to drift a big Mopar car the way they do those rubberband toys that the Japs make calling them race cars??not hardly!!Get 1 of them to do a wheelie or 180mph in the 1/8th on a 1/4 mile track!!NO WAY!!",1259193600,,495,4.26595744680851
