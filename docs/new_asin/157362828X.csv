Pete Williams v. Jason Godsey:

Williams does what they train to do in the Lion's Den: he utilizes his submission skills effectively.

Evan Tanner v. Valeri Ignatov:

Tanner controls this bout and ends it in the 1st round.

Maurice Smith v. Kevin Randleman:

The winner of this fight gets Bas Rutton. I feel a Smith/Rutton fitht would be more interesting, having two world-class strikers face-off, rather than having a wrestler who will want to lie on top of Rutton and ride out the rounds. There is a long feeling-out period in the first round. Randleman slowly takes over the fight and dominates with his grappling skills in his UFC debut. He goes crazy in the post-fight interview, yelling into the camera that wrestlers can fight, too, daring people to come tell him otherwise. He's funny, that Kevin Randleman.

Jeremy Horn v. Chuck Liddell:

This would turn out, given the present state of the UFC, to be one of the brightest moments in Horn's career. It would lead to a rematch 6 years later!

Andre ""The Chief"" Roberts v. Gary ""Big Daddy"" Goodridge:

This one ends early in the first round. Apparently, one of these fighters didn't know there would be strikes to the face in a mixed martial arts fight... This is one of the first standing tapouts I'd ever seen.

Tito Ortiz v. Guy Mezger:

Mezger won their first controversial meeting by submission. This is the 3rd fight in the well-documented fued between Ortiz and the Lion's Den. He'd beaten Bohlander and lost to Mezger. Mezger is actually 4-0 in the UFC at this point. Ortiz ensures a different outcome in this fight by controlling Mezger with his wrestling ability. Good fight - and we get to see Ken Shamrock and Tito go at it verbally after the fight is stopped. Very entertaining. During the extremely drawn-out replay of the end of the fight, you can hear Shamrock calling out to Tito, telling him that he better not see Tito ""wearing that shirt"" (a shirt that said something along the lines of Guy Mezger being his bitch)...  and the fued begins.",1156291200,,2073,4.703601108033241
7798543,4,157362828X,"Young Guns boasts a very impressive fight card.  It starts out with two quick and decisive wins by Pete Williams and Evan Tanner, both of whom displayed a great deal of class after their victories.  Jeremy Horn Vs. Chuck Liddell went the distance, with both fighters turning in very solid performances.  Neither completely dominated, but it was never dull.  Veteran Gary Goodridge returns in true form.  Guy Metzger Vs. Tito Ortiz proved to be quite a battle.  Ortiz was determined to avenge his previous loss to Metzer, and had recently defeated former Lion's Den fighter Jerry Bohlander.  Ortiz proved that his win over Bohlander was no fluke. Unfortunately, his actions after the fight left a great deal to be desired. The only disappointment of the night was the 'Main Event' of Maurice Smith vs. Kevin Randleman.  Smith came in to the fight with high hopes.  His kickboxing and overall fighting strategy had allowed him to defeat some tough opposition in fights prior.  Randleman proved to be an incredible athlete in his own right, possessing great strength, speed, wrestling skills, and confidence that was through the roof.  Smith couldn't quite get it together as he had in fights past.  Overall, one of the best UFCs to date.",992044800,3,1235,4.941747572815534
7798544,4,157362828X,"UFC XIX (Young Guns) had a few late second substitutions, but everything  meshed and we saw a solid card. The bouts were competetive and very  entertaining.
Veterans like Pete Williams, Evan Tanner, and Gary  Goodridge were back against formidable opponents. Two veterans, Jeremy Horn  and Chuck Liddell battled in a great bout with a choke out in the final  seconds.
Due to Pedro Rizzo's affiliation with Bas Rutten, a winner of a  single match would determine Rutten's opponent(for the heavyweight title)  in the following UFC. Ex-Champ Maurice Smith would due battle against  wrestler Kevin Randleman. The fight was a lopsided affair, but settled the  match-up for heavyweight gold.
The main event was originally Vitor  Belfort vs. Guy Metzger, but Belfort wasn't able to fight. In to replace  Belfort was Tito Ortiz, who was fresh off his stunning upset of Jerry  Bohlander. Metzger had beaten Ortiz in a previous match, but Ortiz was a  better more seasoned fighter since their first encounter. The fight was a  crushing blow to the loser, and a stepping stone for the winner.",969235200,5,1081,5.033898305084746
