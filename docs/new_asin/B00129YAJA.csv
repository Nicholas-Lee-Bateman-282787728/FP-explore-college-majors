3086205,5,B00129YAJA,"If you grew up in the 1960's like me watching Universal Monsters and Horror Films you will LOVE this DVD. As a resident of CT, I've been fortunate to visit The Witches Dungeon Museum a few times. It's fun to see the story of it's beginnings. The producers have done a great job of presenting lots of information about the stars of The Creepy Movies we all love as well as the make-up artists and collectors of Horror Memorabilia. All in a nicely photographed entertaining presentation.",1289001600,3,485,4.651162790697675
3086206,5,B00129YAJA,"A wonderful travelogue through monster time and how it influenced and affected young people. The actor who plays a teen Cortlandt is very good. The quality of this ""movie"" shows how much time and effort went into it's production. The lighting, music and narration put it on par with Hollywood documentaries. Great for people just learning about the classic Universal movie monsters or new fans just discovering the rich and interesting time line. If one is not able to travel to Bristol Connecticut then this is the next best thing. Make sure you view it on a hi def 1080p television for the full frightful effect..... The chills are well worth it and may be that this is a prequel to another video sure to come out for the 50th anniversary. Be sure to watch the ""Aurora monsters"" video also. October will soon be upon us.....",1283299200,2,826,4.664383561643835
3086207,3,B00129YAJA,"I am a big fan of Universal Monsters. And the guy who this video is about is truly talented with his creations. Nice to see him recognized by the stars showcased in this video. Only problem I have is I found it through an advertisement...which advertised a sequel to this one. I thought I was getting what I saw advertised...unfortunately, I got the first one. Don't get me wrong, this is nice...but the newer one sounds more interesting. I look forward to that release.",1263081600,,470,4.607142857142857
3086208,5,B00129YAJA,"Anyone who has ever visited Cortlandt Hull's incredible ""Witch's Dungeon"" museum in Bristol, CT, knows that it is a Valentine to classic horror films and the artists who made them. My visit in the late 70's was so life-changing that it inspired me to pursue a career in show business, as it inspired so many others, including some of Hollywood's top make-up and special effects technicians. Just as Cortlandt has preserved movie monsters in wax and plaster, he and Dennis Vincent are preserving the history of this enduring genre. Through personal interviews, never-before-seen video and rare stills, Cortlandt and Dennis lift the shroud and give viewers an inside peek at the original monster makers and actors who brought them to life. Mysteries are revealed, like ""what did Marilyn Monroe say to the Creature from the Black Lagoon?"" and ""whatever happened to Bela Lugosi's Dracula ring and his cape from `Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein'?"" among countless others. This comprehensive documentary is full of thrills, chills and a good dose of laughs. Actor Daniel Roebuck's riff on Cortlandt is priceless. Plus, there is extraordinary footage of his museum that offers a close-up look at the figures he has created to exacting detail. The video leaves one wanting more, but have no fear, I understand that part 2 will be even bigger and better, as these dedicated filmmakers continue to preserve rare interviews and personal memories of actors, artists and historians before all of these wonderful people pass to the great beyond. Don't wait for part 2, order the ""Witch's Dungeon"" DVD before it's gone. You won't be disappointed. Recommended to all fans of monsters, movies and Hollywood.",1202774400,,1694,5.141304347826087
3086209,5,B00129YAJA,"The Witch's Dungeon is more than a traditional destination at Halloween, it is an institution. Cortlandt Hull, a relative of both of Henry ""Werewolf of London"" and Josephine ""Arsenic & Old Lace"" Hull, has continued the family tradition with his collection of life-size, accurate figures from the classic horror movies - Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and especially Price (a personal friend of Hull's) are all represented.

Director Dennis Vincent has created a tribute to the museum filled with interviews with such iconic figures as Sarah Karloff, Bela G. Lugosi, Ron Chaney talk about their film star relatives. Make-up specialists such as Dick Smith talk about the creation process, which Cortlandt has apparently taken to heart. His creations are life-like, chilling and a lot of fun.

If you've had the opportunity to visit Zenobia's dungeon, this will serve as a year-round reminder of the fun. If you don't live in Connecticut, this should convince you to book your airplane seat for Halloween immediately.",1200614400,6,1007,5.248447204968944

8244926,1,B00129YAJA,2 hour infomercial of redundant repetitive banter. Hull sounds like a broken record that needs to be shut off...how many people were paid off in unusual ways to give this junk a 5 star review?? Seems he has a following of minions that applaud when he has a bowel movement...sick..very sick..,1442880000,,291,4.7254901960784315

8244928,4,B00129YAJA,I loved this for many reasons but I wish they had spent more time actually touring the museum. There are a lot of interviews that are really interesting but still...I wanted to see the interior and know the stories behind each display.,1437523200,,235,4.619047619047619
8244929,5,B00129YAJA,"Absolutely superb documentary interviewing the likes of Tom Savini. Dick Smith. Ben Chapman, Etc. Cortlandt Hull has made another great DVD. Great shipping from Hull and he even does a cool sketch on the Mailing envelope. Great Great Great",1399680000,,239,5.153846153846154
8244930,5,B00129YAJA,"Oh what memories I have of watching all the classic horror movies of the 30's and 40's on my local late night horror host's TV show. Dr Shock was the host of Scream In a spooky and kooky late night horror program in the Philadelphia area that ran old horror movies including Frankenstein, The Mummy, Dracula and The Wolfman. This DVD while not a tribute to my childhood TV horror host, is a loving tribute to the monsters and the men and women who brought them to the big(and little)screen! The on screen interviews include Sara Karloff, Bela Lugosi Jr., Ron Chaney, Bob Burns, Tom Savini, Dick Smith to name a few. Many make-up artist and fans brings share many great horror fun memories with us here on this well made documentary that runs two hours.

The DVD is released by a non profit organization (Witches Dungeon) which has a museum dedicated to the famous monsters and the actors who helped bring them to life. If you're a monster kid, buy a copy of this for entertainment and to help preserve the monster kid in all of us!",1399593600,,1031,4.48404255319149
8244931,5,B00129YAJA,"Well from the start let me tell you this producer of this dvd does not have the power and resources of a major motion picture company Like Universal Pictures but damn it looks like it. I would watch this over any movie thats out their now. If you love Monsters and by monsters I,am referring to the classic monsters Like Frankenstein,The Wolfman,The Creature From The Black lagoon,and Dracula ,then let me tell you this will not disapoint you. I think the guy that created this deserves so much credit and he shows just a great love of this genre that it makes one just want more and more of this type of dvd,s from his company. This is my third dvd from this company and I love each one more. Its a shame that his place The Witches Dungeon is not open all year long and is not in a major area where people can see it more. I put this place right up there with Madame Tausauds Wax Museum just in the fact that as your looking at each figure you just gaze in amazement. And a special thanks to Universal Studios for letting him presents these fabulous figures,they could have claimed copyright infrigement but did not and let the public  enjoy what was presented here. Witches Dungeon you deserve all the credit in the world and I hope if I ever get down there even in off season you will let me walk through it. Buy this dvd.",1387238400,,1325,4.3
8244932,5,B00129YAJA,"For a fan of the classic movie monsters this is a true treat.  Interviews w/ historians and those who were there abound PLUS it shows you what can be done in your own backyard! This documentary not only gives you the ability to dream of what you can do in your spare space, but it sheds light on our classic friends once again.  They've been away too long.

The recording quality is fine.  Info is thorough and well presented.  To see the ""movers and shakers"" of monsterdom get behind this project and participate IN it was wonderful.  There wasn't anything I didn't like. Coverage of ""my"" monsters was great.  Coverage of the one I don't care for seemed too long, but I'm sure it was just me ~ and, I hate to admit it, it was still fascinating. I'm a geek.

This is a case of the past being explored by one who loves it and  I would certainly buy this for anyone I knew who liked the monsters of the past!",1372550400,,906,4.22093023255814

8244934,5,B00129YAJA,"Actually, this film could have easily been subtitled FAMOUS MONSTERS (who got em here and who is taking care of em now)! What filmmaker Cortlandt Hull has done with this film, is to create and combine what are essentially three separate and fascinating documentary story lines, interweaving them into a film lover's chronicle in general and a horror buff's celebration in particular.

There are three historical doors that Hull opens here: the first is the origin and history of ""The Witches Dungeon"", Hull's own creation and personal homage to the great icons of horror films, a horror museum in his hometown in Conneticut, which over several weeks in October attracts scores of horror fans from around the country. A museum which he began as a young boy and has remained faithful to throughout the years. An artist, sculptor, film historian, not to mention actual grand nephew of the celebrated actor Henry Hull (Werewolf of London, Lifeboat),he guides the viewer to places in film history that have been overlooked even by documentaries offered by the major studios.

The second door features one of the most extensive ""how they did it"" documentaries I have ever seen examining the great iconic film monsters: Dracula,Frankensteins'Monster,WolfMan,Hunchback,Creature from the Black Lagoon,Phantom et al. Make no mistake, this is no VH1 assembly of ""cutsy commentary"". This is the REAL DEAL with some fascinating historical commentary/discussion conducted by some of the film stars themselves: Christopher Lee discusses his own take on Dracula and Hammer studio's treatment of the character and wait till you see the guy who actually played The Creature From The Black Lagoon! More touching are the family members and friends of the great actors who brought these iconic images to life reminiscing quite proudly about their fathers/mothers dedication to their craft.

The third opened door here examines the dedicated movement in preserving the Film Monster legacy as well as the integrity of the artists themselves. Insights from family members/friends Ron Chaney, Sarah Karloff, June Foray, Casandra Peterson (Elvira), Basil Gogos,Cortlandt Hull and others highlight the joys and challenges of this effort.

The most moving part of the film for me however, comes in what is arguably the best testimony to the significance of ""The Witches Dungeon"" itself and its' unique contribution to the genre. Film legend Vincent Price along with Cortlandt Hull join forces to save the museum at a time when ""forces that be"" sought to close it down. But thats a ""spoiler"" I won't commit here. Enjoy the journey into imagination and thrills... not to mention a bit of love.

A wonderful film on several levels... or better said ...""Its' alive""! The Monsters are in good hands",1297382400,4,2765,5.218468468468468
