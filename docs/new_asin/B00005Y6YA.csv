of a movie or dvd! This is a sight to review quality of product,

not a place to voice your opinion on a movie! That you can do at

IMDB.COM! Well at any rate, this is the double feature Choy Lay

Fut and Tiger Claws! Now, Ground zero has considered Choy to be

a lost film and it shows. The film has tons of scratches,

blemishes, tracking issues and just about everything else you

can think of! It' really bad! but it's still watchable if you

are a hardcore advocate of kung fu and don't mind all the crap

on the screen! And also on the botton right corner there a logo

that VS and it's there all through the film! Choy is in

widescreen, with french and arabic subtitles, english dubbed!

The other film is Tiger's Claw! Now if this movie were in

widescreen, I would consider this one of the best kung fu movies

ever! But I feel the screen is way too close cuz the fights were

off screen sometimes! That agitates me! There is a reason why

these films are in WIDESCREEN! To see the fights perfectly, but

the wide-eyes of an American don't like that! So can you do!?!

Tiger's Claw is english dubbed, fullscreen! The picture is ok!

Nothing to complain about!",1116720000,,1233,4.3056768558951966
