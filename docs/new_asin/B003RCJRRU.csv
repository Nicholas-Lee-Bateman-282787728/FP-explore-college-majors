8403527,5,B003RCJRRU,"As I have been (from the beginning stages of playing guitar until now) seeking to find any kind of material over the subject of tapping, it is fairly difficult for the most part. This DVD is one of my top ""go-to"" for it covers many different ways of not only tapping, but keeping a creative mind, and being open to many possibilities. Definitely give it a go!",1369785600,,359,4.373134328358209
8403528,5,B003RCJRRU,"The best tapping dvd available, what I really like about Mark is the principle he shares about using the tapping musically because its very useful to cover various scale positions with very little effort. Mark IS THE MAN! Please make some more :-)",1366243200,,247,4.767441860465116
